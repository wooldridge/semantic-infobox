Category:        The project's human beneficiaries, tribal peoples and forest fringe&#13;
villagers, belong to the poorest sections of society. Tribal&#13;
development concerns are central to the project. They are addressed in&#13;
an integral fashion under the rubric of social impact, participation, and&#13;
equity, rather than as a subsidiary tribal development plan or&#13;
component. The project also incorporates specific measures to&#13;
safeguard the interests of the landless and women, through&#13;
participation in village committees, employment preference, and&#13;
ongoing social assessment review and other monitoring.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                ii&#13;
Project          The project would conserve biodiversity in seven globally significant&#13;
Description:     protected areas (PAs) using ecodevelopment. This is a strategy to&#13;
increase collaboration between local people and government managers&#13;
of PAs, as well as to otherwise improve PA management. The project&#13;
would also include support for preparing future biodiversity projects.&#13;
The project has five basic objectives:&#13;
(a) Improved PA management, through strengthened capacity to&#13;
conserve biodiversity and increased opportunities for local&#13;
participation in PA management activities and decisions. Activities&#13;
include (i) improving PA planning processes and building capacity, (ii)&#13;
protecting and managing ecosystems and habitats, and (iii) upgrading&#13;
PA amenities for field staff&#13;
(b) Village ecodevelopment to reduce negative impacts of local&#13;
people on PAs, reduce negative impacts of PAs on local people, and&#13;
increase collaboration of local people in conservation efforts.&#13;
Activities would include: (i) participatory microplanning and providing&#13;
implementation support, (ii) reciprocal commitments to foster&#13;
altemative livelihoods and resource uses, and (iii) special programs:&#13;
additional joint forest management support, voluntary relocation&#13;
options; and supplemental investments that benefit PA biodiversity&#13;
conservation and people in and around the PAs.&#13;
(c) Development of more effective and extensive support for PA&#13;
management and ecodevelopment through (i) environmental&#13;
education and visitor management and (ii) impact monitoring and&#13;
research to improve understanding of issues and solutions relevant to&#13;
PA management and interactions between PAs and people.&#13;
(d) Overall project management, including effective project&#13;
administration, implementation guidelines, implementation reviews,&#13;
policy and strategic framework studies, and publicity.&#13;
(e) Preparation of future biodiversity projects including additional&#13;
ecodevelopment, biodiversity information, and ex-situ conservation.&#13;
Rate of Return:  Not applicable.&#13;
Benefits:        The project would conserve globally significant biodiversity in the&#13;
seven PAs by slowing, halting, or possibly even reversing declines in&#13;
the richness, complexity, diversity, connectivity, and regeneration of&#13;
ecosystems and species. The project would increase the capacity of&#13;
government officials to manage PAs effectively, addressing not only&#13;
internal operations but also proposed and existing periphery and&#13;
regional activities that impact the PAs. It would increase local&#13;
people's support for and role in PA conservation. It would create&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                iii&#13;
organizational processes that could be expanded to other ecologically&#13;
significant areas.&#13;
More specifically, the project would:&#13;
(a) broaden the focus of PA management planning, restore&#13;
ecosystems, improve fire and poaching control, and improve staff&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness;&#13;
(b) enable communities to meet their needs in an environmentally&#13;
sustainable manner, reduce unsustainable uses of PA resources, offset&#13;
negative economic and cultural impacts of PAs on local communities,&#13;
and resolve conflicts&#13;
(c) provide a firmer base of public support for PAs and increase&#13;
understanding of PA biodiversity, local people, and their interactions;&#13;
(d) provide the technical review and administrative and financial&#13;
services necessary for quality control, accountability, adaptive&#13;
management, improvement of the long-term framework,&#13;
dissemination, integration, and overall timeliness of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(e) produce a portfolio of biodiversity project proposals eligible for&#13;
GEF, IDA, and other donor consideration.&#13;
Risks:           Risks are high because the project will be supporting an innovative&#13;
program. Although it is not possible to fully address problems of&#13;
population growth, poverty, and commercial interests, the project&#13;
includes activities, institutional mechanisms, and a legal covenant&#13;
designed to address regional issues. To reduce the risk of the project&#13;
being blamed by association for negative trends and unmet needs, it&#13;
would promote realistic expections through monitoring benchmarks&#13;
and by emphasizing "reduction" not "elimination" of negative impacts&#13;
To encourage government commitment to participation, the project&#13;
would allocate financing according to a continuing review of work&#13;
plans and progress reports and avoid a blueprint approach. To&#13;
facilitate a gradual increase in trust of local communities, the project&#13;
would use participatory planning processes. To address limitations in&#13;
the supply of technical and management expertise, the project design&#13;
involves extensive use of third party contracts (mostly NGOs). To&#13;
address inexperience, detailed documentation is providing guidance on&#13;
project processes.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ECODEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. Background&#13;
A. Extent and Status of Biodiversity&#13;
1.1   Biological Significance. India's biodiversity is rich, often unique and increasingly&#13;
endangered. India is one of the twelve megadiversity countries in the world, that&#13;
collectively account for 60-70 percent of the world's biodiversity. Its ten biogeographic&#13;
zones represent a broad range of ecosystems. India has 6% of the world's flowering plant&#13;
species and 14% of the world's birds. There are over 45,000 identified plant species. One-&#13;
third of its 15,000 flowering plants are found only in India. It has 81,000 identified species&#13;
of animals. Some 14% of its 1,228 bird species, 32% of its 446 reptile species and 62% of&#13;
its 204 amphibians are unique to India. The endangerment of some ten percent of all plant&#13;
species and over 21% of the 372 mammal species indicates a widespread degradation of&#13;
ecosystems that has significant economic implications.&#13;
1.2   Economic Importance. India's biological resources are economically important,&#13;
both globally and nationally. As one of the oldest and largest agricultural societies, India&#13;
has an impressive diversity of crop species and varieties. At least 166 species of crop&#13;
plants and 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crops originate on the subcontinent.&#13;
About 90% of all medicines in India come from plant species, many of which are harvested&#13;
in the wild. Medicinal plants and other non-timber forest products are particularly&#13;
important as a source of income and subsistence for tribal populations. Closed primary&#13;
forests, which cover about 21 million hectares, or six percent of the total land area, and&#13;
one-third of the total forest area, have been an important source of timber and fuelwood.&#13;
Natural ecosystems strongly influence natural resource development (agriculture,&#13;
livestock, forestry and fishery sectors contributed 32% of GDP in 1992/3), provide new&#13;
commercial products (e.g., pharmaceuticals) and also affect water resource management,&#13;
which is important not only for agriculture but also for industrial and municipal&#13;
development.&#13;
1.3   Protected Areas. India has 75 parks and 421 sanctuaries, covering some 14&#13;
million hectares (i.e., 4.3 percent of the total land area). Most of these areas received&#13;
protection status relatively recently; there were only 10 parks and 127 sanctuaries in 1970.&#13;
Selected high priority parks and sanctuaries, sometimes in combination with contiguous&#13;
reserve forest areas are managed as tiger and elephant reserves. ). Some protected areas&#13;
(PAs) have few or no human inhabitants, while others have small communities with&#13;
significant human populations in the aggregate. Village economies on the peripheries of&#13;
these protected areas are based on long-established sedentary agricultural systems.&#13;
1.4   Pressures. The biodiversity in India's forest, grassland, wetland and marine&#13;
ecosystems faces many pressures. These include grazing cattle, cutting of trees for fuel,&#13;
and timber, gathering of non-timber forest products, hunting, uncontrolled fires, and&#13;
conversion for and spillover from agricultural, infrastructure, industrial, and commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 2&#13;
development (e.g., pollution, siltation, and weed infestation). India's high levels of human&#13;
population density and growth, high incidence of poverty, and large numbers of livestock&#13;
speed the degradation. Local people, when traditional rights and access are limited by the&#13;
establishment of PAs, often have little incentive to use natural resources in a sustainable&#13;
way.&#13;
B. Govemment Policy&#13;
1.5   India's forest and environmental policies, plans, and actions reflect a significant,&#13;
continuing commitment to biodiversity conservation. Annex I provides a detailed&#13;
overview of these policies and related legislation&#13;
1.6    Convention on Biological Diversity. The Government of India has ratified the&#13;
Convention and taken recent policy and program initiatives corresponding to Convention&#13;
aims. These are to reconcile the need for conservation with the concern for development&#13;
and give careful consideration to equity and shared responsibility. Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Forestry (MOEF) is identifying further actions required by the Convention.&#13;
1.7   Biodiversity in Action Plans and Policy Statements. The Government's plans&#13;
and policies reflect its strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.&#13;
The 1988 National Forest Policy treats forests as: (a) an ecological necessity, (b) a source&#13;
of goods for use by local populations, and (c) a source of wood and other products for&#13;
industries and other non-local users. India's Environmental Action Plan, published in&#13;
1993, lists "conservation of and sustainable utilization of biodiversity in selected&#13;
ecosystems" as one of the top seven priorities for future action, and specifically cites&#13;
ecodevelopment. The National Wildlife Action Plan (1983) identified the following goals:&#13;
(a)    Establishing a representative network of protected areas&#13;
(b)   Developing appropriate management systems for protected areas, with due&#13;
regard for the needs of local people and ensuring their support and&#13;
involvement&#13;
(c)    Protecting biodiversity within multiple-use areas, and&#13;
(d)   Extending conservation efforts beyond protected areas.&#13;
In 1988, the Wildlife Institute of India produced a biogeographic classification for&#13;
conservation planning and formulated a plan for a revised network of protected areas.&#13;
1.8   Interaction Between Protected Areas and Local People. In the past twenty&#13;
years, state governments, with national assistance, have developed an extensive network&#13;
of PAs strongly enforced by forest departments. During this period, governments'&#13;
approach to local people has sometimes been confrontational with significant impacts,&#13;
mostly negative, on the tribal populations resident within protected areas. There is a long&#13;
history of communities, especially tribal groups, inhabiting or using forests that were&#13;
subsequently designated as PAs. Local people were involved (usually without government&#13;
recognition or sanction) in managing the forest and wildlife. Increasing government&#13;
protection and legal control have curtailed local communities' resource use and&#13;
management, forced changes in traditional livelihoods, and removed incentives to use&#13;
resources sustainably. Forest department employment opportunities have also shrunk with&#13;
the establishment of PAs and the ban on timber harvesting in most forest areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                3&#13;
1.9   Community Participation in Forest Management. Now the Government is&#13;
recognizing the historic, current, and potential role of local communities. The initial&#13;
government effort to increase community participation was focused not on protected&#13;
areas, but rather on forests officially designated for local or commercial harvest. Through&#13;
this effort, called joint forest management (JFM), decision-making authority and&#13;
responsibility for control over forest lands and their products are shared between forest&#13;
departments and local user groups. Agreements specify the distribution of authority,&#13;
responsibility, and benefits. Initiated in the 1970s, early success led to expansion of JFM&#13;
programs throughout India. Several now receive support through Bank-funded state&#13;
forestry projects.&#13;
C. Ecodevelopment Strategy&#13;
1.10  Definition of Ecodevelopment. In response to pressures on protected areas, the&#13;
Government is now beginning to address the special issues regarding participatory&#13;
management of protected areas through a strategy of ecodevelopment. The strategy aims&#13;
to conserve biodiversity by addressing both the impact of local people on the protected&#13;
areas and the impact of the protected areas on local people Ecodevelopment thus has&#13;
two main thrusts: improvement of PA management and involvement of local people. In&#13;
doing so it seeks to improve the capacity of PA management to conserve biodiversity&#13;
effectively, to involve local people in PA planning and protection, to develop incentives&#13;
for conservation, and to support sustainable alternatives to harmful use of resources. It&#13;
supports collaboration between the state forest departments and local communities in and&#13;
around ecologically valuable areas. Ecodevelopment addresses the welfare and behavior of&#13;
local people and integrates these concerns into management of protected areas. It also&#13;
builds private-sector stakeholder support for conservation among NGOs, nature tour&#13;
operators, and the general public.&#13;
1.11  Existing Ecodevelopment Programs. To date, programs for supporting PA/local&#13;
community linkages have been limited and small scale. In recent years, using domestic&#13;
financing, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) has initiated a centrally&#13;
sponsored scheme with an annual average value of about US$1 million that is distributed&#13;
to dozens of PAs. The Bank has financed five forestry projects with biodiversity&#13;
conservation components that include village ecodevelopment investments associated with&#13;
protected areas. Implementation of these ecodevelopment programs is only beginning.&#13;
Nevertheless, the design of the Ecodevelopment Project has already built on the&#13;
conceptualization and participatory planning of the earlier programs. The specialized&#13;
attention that preparation of the Ecodevelopment Project has received has already&#13;
produced detailed written guidelines that are being applied to programs already in&#13;
progress.&#13;
1.12  Potential Scope of Ecodevelopment. Should this project prove it to be feasible,&#13;
ecodevelopment potentially might benefit 100-200 PAs. As a next step, the Government is&#13;
seeking support for an experimental demonstration and capacity-building project that&#13;
would build on and integrate existing experience, would be large enough to establish the&#13;
feasibility of ecodevelopment in a variety of situations, and would provide for expansion in&#13;
the long term. As a national project, such an undertaking would have the potential to&#13;
address multi-state ecodevelopment issues and management processes and to establish a&#13;
basis for programmatic financing. Proceeding now with a limited version of such a project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               4&#13;
is justified by the extent and urgency of human pressures on protected areas. Incorporating&#13;
full-scale ecodevelopment at a large number of sites at this time would not be appropriate,&#13;
given the complexity of issues, lack of implementation experience, and amount of&#13;
participatory preparation required.&#13;
D. Existing Institutional Responsibilities, Capacity and Coordination&#13;
1.13  Protected Area Management. State and national governments take their&#13;
responsibility for PA management seriously and professionally, and have assigned&#13;
significant numbers of staff. The national Project Tiger scheme, for example, supplements&#13;
state support in 21 PAs by providing incentives to staff and by compensating local people&#13;
for animal depredation. Although funding for PA management has been limited, it has been&#13;
more adequate than in most developing countries. Management plans exist for all seven&#13;
project PAs and cover an implementation period of 5 to 10 years, but most of these plans&#13;
need updating in the next few years, and management skills of PA staff need improvement.&#13;
In addition, PA management activities need to be better integrated into the broader&#13;
ecological, sociological, and regional sphere. In many Indian PAs, humans have already&#13;
modified the environment so much that the remaining species and ecological communities&#13;
need carefully planned human intervention in order to survive.&#13;
1.14  Village Ecodevelopment. In existing programs, the linkage between village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments and conservation actions has generally been implicit rather&#13;
than explicit, through reciprocal commitments. Government initiatives have usually&#13;
employed traditional top-down approaches to project planning and implementation, even&#13;
when the programs have embraced the principle of a more participatory approach.&#13;
Detailed guidance on participatory processes has been lacking. Some forest department&#13;
staff have experience relevant to village ecodevelopment based on their work with past&#13;
and ongoing joint forest management and social forestry programs. Training programs are&#13;
now being designed to apply this expertise to PA-oriented ecodevelopment microplanning.&#13;
NGOs also have extensive capacity and experience in fostering community participation.&#13;
PA authorities have begun to forge links with NGOs but these links generally have relied&#13;
on informal arrangements rather than formal contracts.&#13;
1.15  Environmental Education. PA awareness and education programs have mainly&#13;
consisted of the construction of an interpretation center for visitors and the preparation of&#13;
posters or leaflets.&#13;
1.16 Monitoring and Research. Monitoring in PAs has focused on large mammals.&#13;
There is room for improvement in both the methodological design of existing activities and&#13;
the breadth of focus. Research institutions and individuals have conducted a number of&#13;
studies and inventories of flora and fauna. This research has contributed to redefinition of&#13;
PA boundaries, the establishment of new PAs, and recognition of the need for increased&#13;
policing, but additional research is needed to improve the understanding of other issues&#13;
relevant to PA management. PAs lack the facilities, equipment, and personnel to&#13;
undertake research themselves.&#13;
1.17  Annex 2 provides further analysis of the existing organizational structure and&#13;
capacity.&#13;

E. Lessons from Other Projects&#13;
1.18  Conservation, forestry, rural/urban development, and multi-state projects have all&#13;
provided lessons that highlight the importance of:&#13;
(a)    Linkage between economic investments and conservation&#13;
(b)   Building understanding and consensus on project concept&#13;
(c)    Maintaining project size within realistic, achievable limits&#13;
(d)   Involving disadvantaged groups in participatory resource management&#13;
(e)   Using contractual agreements between government entities and local&#13;
communities&#13;
(f)    Assessing incentives for beneficiaries&#13;
(g)   Avoiding numerical physical output targets and top-down planning&#13;
(h)   Using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) exercises and cost sharing&#13;
arrangements to increase ownership, appropriateness, and sustainability of&#13;
investments&#13;
(i)    Using existing organizational structures and skilled specialists&#13;
(j)    Developing transparent and verifiable monitoring to ensure accountability&#13;
(k)   Disbursing funds to states in response to past performance and to work&#13;
plans that meet clear criteria&#13;
(I)    Specifying a clear identity and mandate, designated full-time staff, and&#13;
adequately delegated financial and administrative powers for the central&#13;
coordinating unit.&#13;
Annex 3 provides a further summary of lessons learned.&#13;
F. Project Preparation Process&#13;
1.19  Site Selection Criteria. In consultation with NGOs and state governments,&#13;
MOEF selected project PAs from a list of areas where the threats to biodiversity stem&#13;
from local rural dependencies. Selection criteria comprised biodiversity importance,&#13;
biogeographic representation and likelihood of success. The success factor took into&#13;
account the extent of human pressures, PA management capacity, existing infrastructure&#13;
(which accounts for six of the eight sites being tiger reserves), accessibility, state and&#13;
national government support and state government responsiveness to community and&#13;
NGO involvement in forest management.&#13;
1.20  Exclusion of Similipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa. The 1994 government proposal&#13;
was for eight sites, but the Bank reduced the project scope to seven sites by excluding the&#13;
Similipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa, without prejudice to future considerations. The Bank&#13;
received documentation on relocation plans and activities in Similipal, but this did not&#13;
confirm that all relocation after preappraisal had been and could in the future be consistent&#13;
with the project strategy for people in the PAs. The Bank was particularly concerned that&#13;
relocation be voluntary and be consistent with the best practices outlined in the Bank's&#13;
operational directives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                2&#13;
development (e.g., pollution, siltation, and weed infestation). India's high levels of human&#13;
population density and growth, high incidence of poverty, and large numbers of livestock&#13;
speed the degradation. Local people, when traditional rights and access are limited by the&#13;
establishment of PAs, often have little incentive to use natural resources in a sustainable&#13;
way.&#13;
B. Government Policy&#13;
1.5   India's forest and environmental policies, plans, and actions reflect a significant,&#13;
continuing commitment to biodiversity conservation. Annex 1 provides a detailed&#13;
overview of these policies and related legislation&#13;
1.6   Convention on Biological Diversity. The Government of India has ratified the&#13;
Convention and taken recent policy and program initiatives corresponding to Convention&#13;
aims. These are to reconcile the need for conservation with the concern for development&#13;
and give careful consideration to equity and shared responsibility. Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Forestry (MOEF) is identifying further actions required by the Convention.&#13;
1.7   Biodiversity in Action Plans and Policy Statements. The Government's plans&#13;
and policies reflect its strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.&#13;
The 1988 National Forest Policy treats forests as: (a) an ecological necessity, (b) a source&#13;
of goods for use by local populations, and (c) a source of wood and other products for&#13;
industries and other non-local users. India's Environmental Action Plan, published in&#13;
1993, lists "conservation of and sustainable utilization of biodiversity in selected&#13;
ecosystems" as one of the top seven priorities for future action, and specifically cites&#13;
ecodevelopment. The National Wildlife Action Plan (1983) identified the following goals:&#13;
(a)   Establishing a representative network of protected areas&#13;
(b)   Developing appropriate management systems for protected areas, with due&#13;
regard for the needs of local people and ensuring their support and&#13;
involvement&#13;
(c)   Protecting biodiversity within multiple-use areas, and&#13;
(d)   Extending conservation efforts beyond protected areas.&#13;
In 1988, the Wildlife Institute of India produced a biogeographic classification for&#13;
conservation planning and formulated a plan for a revised network of protected areas.&#13;
1.8   Interaction Between Protected Areas and Local People. In the past twenty&#13;
years, state governments, with national assistance, have developed an extensive network&#13;
of PAs strongly enforced by forest departments. During this period, governments'&#13;
approach to local people has sometimes been confrontational with significant impacts,&#13;
mostly negative, on the tribal populations resident within protected areas. There is a long&#13;
history of communities, especially tribal groups, inhabiting or using forests that were&#13;
subsequently designated as PAs. Local people were involved (usually without government&#13;
recognition or sanction) in managing the forest and wildlife. Increasing government&#13;
protection and legal control have curtailed local communities' resource use and&#13;
management, forced changes in traditional livelihoods, and removed incentives to use&#13;
resources sustainably. Forest department employment opportunities have also shrunk with&#13;
the establishment of PAs and the ban on timber harvesting in most forest areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                3&#13;
1.9   Community Participation in Forest Management. Now the Government is&#13;
recognizing the historic, current, and potential role of local communities. The initial&#13;
government effort to increase community participation was focused not on protected&#13;
areas, but rather on forests officially designated for local or commercial harvest. Through&#13;
this effort, called joint forest management (JFM), decision-making authority and&#13;
responsibility for control over forest lands and their products are shared between forest&#13;
departments and local user groups. Agreements specify the distribution of authority,&#13;
responsibility, and benefits. Initiated in the 1970s, early success led to expansion of JFM&#13;
programs throughout India. Several now receive support through Bank-funded state&#13;
forestry projects.&#13;
C. Ecodevelopment Strategy&#13;
1.10  Definition of Ecodevelopment. In response to pressures on protected areas, the&#13;
Government is now beginning to address the special issues regarding participatory&#13;
management of protected areas through a strategy of ecodevelopment. The strategy aims&#13;
to conserve biodiversity by addressing both the impact of local people on the protected&#13;
areas and the impact of the protected areas on local people. Ecodevelopment thus has&#13;
two main thrusts: improvement of PA management and involvement of local people. In&#13;
doing so it seeks to improve the capacity of PA management to conserve biodiversity&#13;
effectively, to involve local people in PA planning and protection, to develop incentives&#13;
for conservation, and to support sustainable alternatives to harmful use of resources. It&#13;
supports collaboration between the state forest departments and local communities in and&#13;
around ecologically valuable areas. Ecodevelopment addresses the welfare and behavior of&#13;
local people and integrates these concerns into management of protected areas. It also&#13;
builds private-sector stakeholder support for conservation among NGOs, nature tour&#13;
operators, and the general public.&#13;
1.11  Existing Ecodevelopment Programs. To date, programs for supporting PA/local&#13;
community linkages have been limited and small scale. In recent years, using domestic&#13;
financing, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) has initiated a centrally&#13;
sponsored scheme with an annual average value of about US$1 million that is distributed&#13;
to dozens of PAs. The Bank has financed five forestry projects with biodiversity&#13;
conservation components that include village ecodevelopment investments associated with&#13;
protected areas. Implementation of these ecodevelopment programs is only beginning.&#13;
Nevertheless, the design of the Ecodevelopment Project has already built on the&#13;
conceptualization and participatory planning of the earlier programs. The specialized&#13;
attention that preparation of the Ecodevelopment Project has received has already&#13;
produced detailed written guidelines that are being applied to programs already in&#13;
progress.&#13;
1.12  Potential Scope of Ecodevelopment. Should this project prove it to be feasible,&#13;
ecodevelopment potentially might benefit 100-200 PAs. As a next step, the Government is&#13;
seeking support for an experimental demonstration and capacity-building project that&#13;
would build on and integrate existing experience, would be large enough to establish the&#13;
feasibility of ecodevelopment in a variety of situations, and would provide for expansion in&#13;
the long term. As a national project, such an undertaking would have the potential to&#13;
address multi-state ecodevelopment issues and management processes and to establish a&#13;
basis for programmatic financing. Proceeding now with a limited version of such a project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               4&#13;
is justified by the extent and urgency of human pressures on protected areas. Incorporating&#13;
full-scale ecodevelopment at a large number of sites at this time would not be appropriate,&#13;
given the complexity of issues, lack of implementation experience, and amount of&#13;
participatory preparation required.&#13;
D. Existing Institutional Responsibilities, Capacity and Coordination&#13;
1.13 Protected Area Management. State and national governments take their&#13;
responsibility for PA management seriously and professionally, and have assigned&#13;
significant numbers of staff. The national Project Tiger scheme, for example, supplements&#13;
state support in 21 PAs by providing incentives to staff and by compensating local people&#13;
for animal depredation. Although funding for PA management has been limited, it has been&#13;
more adequate than in most developing countries. Management plans exist for all seven&#13;
project PAs and cover an implementation period of 5 to 10 years, but most of these plans&#13;
need updating in the next few years, and management skills of PA staff need improvement.&#13;
In addition, PA management activities need to be better integrated into the broader&#13;
ecological, sociological, and regional sphere. In many Indian PAs, humans have already&#13;
modified the environment so much that the remaining species and ecological communities&#13;
need carefully planned human intervention in order to survive.&#13;
1.14 Village Ecodevelopment. In existing programs, the linkage between village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments and conservation actions has generally been implicit rather&#13;
than explicit, through reciprocal commitments. Government initiatives have usually&#13;
employed traditional top-down approaches to project planning and implementation, even&#13;
when the programs have embraced the principle of a more participatory approach.&#13;
Detailed guidance on participatory processes has been lacking. Some forest department&#13;
staff have experience relevant to village ecodevelopment based on their work with past&#13;
and ongoing joint forest management and social forestry programs. Training programs are&#13;
now being designed to apply this expertise to PA-oriented ecodevelopment microplanning.&#13;
NGOs also have extensive capacity and experience in fostering community participation.&#13;
PA authorities have begun to forge links with NGOs but these links generally have relied&#13;
on informal arrangements rather than formal contracts.&#13;
1.15  Environmental Education. PA awareness and education programs have mainly&#13;
consisted of the construction of an interpretation center for visitors and the preparation of&#13;
posters or leaflets.&#13;
1.16 Monitoring and Research. Monitoring in PAs has focused on large mammals.&#13;
There is room for improvement in both the methodological design of existing activities and&#13;
the breadth of focus. Research institutions and individuals have conducted a number of&#13;
studies and inventories of flora and fauna. This research has contributed to redefinition of&#13;
PA boundaries, the establishment of new PAs, and recognition of the need for increased&#13;
policing, but additional research is needed to improve the understanding of other issues&#13;
relevant to PA management. PAs lack the facilities, equipment, and personnel to&#13;
undertake research themselves.&#13;
1.17  Annex 2 provides further analysis of the existing organizational structure and&#13;
capacity.&#13;

E. Lessons from Other Projects&#13;
1.18   Conservation, forestry, rural/urban development, and multi-state projects have all&#13;
provided lessons that highlight the importance of:&#13;
(a)    Linkage between economic investments and conservation&#13;
(b)   Building understanding and consensus on project concept&#13;
(c)   Maintaining project size within realistic, achievable limits&#13;
(d)   Involving disadvantaged groups in participatory resource management&#13;
(e)    Using contractual agreements between govermnent entities and local&#13;
communities&#13;
(f)    Assessing incentives for beneficiaries&#13;
(g)   Avoiding numerical physical output targets and top-down planning&#13;
(h)   Using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) exercises and cost sharing&#13;
arrangements to increase ownership, appropriateness, and sustainability of&#13;
investments&#13;
(i)    Using existing organizational structures and skilled specialists&#13;
(j)    Developing transparent and verifiable monitoring to ensure accountability&#13;
(k)   Disbursing funds to states in response to past performance and to work&#13;
plans that meet clear criteria&#13;
(l)    Specifying a clear identity and mandate, designated full-time staff, and&#13;
adequately delegated financial and administrative powers for the central&#13;
coordinating unit.&#13;
Annex 3 provides a further summary of lessons learned.&#13;
F. Project Preparation Process&#13;
1.19   Site Selection Criteria. In consultation with NGOs and state governments,&#13;
MOEF selected project PAs from a list of areas where the threats to biodiversity stem&#13;
from local rural dependencies. Selection criteria comprised biodiversity importance,&#13;
biogeographic representation and likelihood of success. The success factor took into&#13;
account the extent of human pressures, PA management capacity, existing infrastructure&#13;
(which accounts for six of the eight sites being tiger reserves), accessibility, state and&#13;
national government support and state government responsiveness to community and&#13;
NGO involvement in forest management.&#13;
1.20  Exclusion of Similipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa. The 1994 government proposal&#13;
was for eight sites, but the Bank reduced the project scope to seven sites by excluding the&#13;
Similipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa, without prejudice to future considerations. The Bank&#13;
received documentation on relocation plans and activities in Similipal, but this did not&#13;
confirm that all relocation after preappraisal had been and could in the future be consistent&#13;
with the project strategy for people in the PAs. The Bank was particularly concerned that&#13;
relocation be voluntary and be consistent with the best practices outlined in the Bank's&#13;
operational directives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 6&#13;
1.21   Participatory Preparation Process. Preparation for the project has emphasized&#13;
client ownership, local participation and public involvement (e.g., information&#13;
dissemination, consultations). MOEF prepared the project with the assistance of&#13;
professional institutes, NGOs and state forestry departments and financing from the&#13;
UNDP/GEF Preinvestment Facility. Bank staff and foreign consultants provided limited&#13;
periodic comments and advice. The preparation incorporated technical papers from in-&#13;
country experts, reviews of completed studies, and collections of available information&#13;
(e.g. population censuses, ethnographies, scientific reports). It also applied participatory&#13;
rural appraisal (PRA) techniques and indicative planning in an innovative way based on&#13;
sample views of local people about biodiversity issues. Preparation was conducted by one&#13;
NGO/professional institute as national coordinator, two professional ecological/wildlife&#13;
institutes, four specialists as national consultants and twelve state-level NGOs. More than&#13;
40 conservation and rural development NGOs have participated in the NGO and public&#13;
consultations. Preparation included 38 recorded meetings between March 1992 and May&#13;
1995 to discuss project design and work plans. There were 14 site visits to select the sites,&#13;
four inter-state PRA training sessions, four state-level PRA training workshops, and&#13;
eleven national consultation meetings. Annex 4 provides a more detailed description of the&#13;
project preparation process.&#13;
1.22  Project Preparation Facility Advance. In January, 1995, in response to a request&#13;
from GOI, the Bank provided a US$2 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF) Advance.&#13;
The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) countersigned the PPF agreement letter in&#13;
March, 1995, but the flow of funds began only in December 1995. In order to meet the&#13;
condition of appraisal by May, 1995, government agencies, NGOs, and other&#13;
organizations that prepared essential reports spent their own resources in anticipation of&#13;
eventual reimbursement by the PPF. In addition to providing funds for completing project&#13;
design prior to project appraisal, the advance is expected to finance village&#13;
ecodevelopment activities on a pilot basis, consultancies needed to develop detailed&#13;
guidelines and arrangements, office equipment, training and workshops in preparation for&#13;
project startup expected in October 1996. A portion of the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) credit would be used to refinance the advance. The initiation of&#13;
negotiations of the Ecodevelopment Project was contingent on many actions associated&#13;
with the PPF including guarantees that GOI and state governments had begun to&#13;
implement the activities required for a timely and full-scale startup to the project and had&#13;
demonstrated their capacity to meet project administration requirements. These actions are&#13;
described in relevant sections of Chapters l1-V and summarized in Chapter VI.&#13;
3&#13;
Discussions with NGOs have revealed a range of perspectives, including constructive suggestions for&#13;
design improvements and expressions of distrust of any activities receiving financial support from&#13;
the Bank.&#13;

II. The Project&#13;
A. Rationale for GEF and IDA Funding&#13;
2.1   Rationale for GEF Involvement and Incremental Costs. The project is fully&#13;
consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the GEF Council guidance.&#13;
The GOI has identified ecodevelopment as a national priority in the biodiversity action&#13;
plans and policy statements (see paragraph 1.7). The project would address urgent global&#13;
biodiversity conservation needs. The project would conserve biodiversity in seven critical&#13;
areas, in a megadiversity country. One of the seven areas, Gir, has the world's only&#13;
population of Asian lions. The other six project sites support vital populations of tigers,&#13;
one of the world's most endangered carnivores. In combination, these sites give good&#13;
biogeographic and habitat coverage (e.g., dry deciduous open forests, semi-evergreen&#13;
forests, moist deciduous open forests and wet evergreen forests, in forest, semiarid, and&#13;
mountain ecosystems). The level of threats to biodiversity in the seven sites is high and&#13;
requires a substantial effort on an urgent basis. The analysis of incremental costs in&#13;
accordance with GEF guidelines shows baseline costs of US$19 million and incremental&#13;
costs of US$48 million, which would be financed by GEF and IDA. The Government of&#13;
India realizes that, in view of the scale of external funding required, it cannot expect to&#13;
receive a GEF grant sufficient to cover the entire incremental cost of the global&#13;
alternative. However, it is so strongly committed to the objectives of the project that it is&#13;
willing to borrow up to US$28 million of IDA resources to cover 58% of the incremental&#13;
cost. A GEF grant of US$20 million would cover the remaining 42% of the incremental&#13;
cost. Annex 5 further analyzes the rationale for GEF, including the calculation of&#13;
incremental costs.&#13;
2.2   Country Assistance Strategy The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
India dated May 1995 explicitly encourages Bank and GEF financing of ecodevelopment&#13;
as an important way for the Bank to support biodiversity conservation. The CAS mentions&#13;
that such financing would build on the Bank's support for recent forestry projects. The&#13;
project would also act on CAS concerns by enhancing participation, involving NGOs, and&#13;
increasing women's role in managing productive resources. The project also would&#13;
implement the new approaches to conservation outlined in the Bank's 1991 Forest Sector&#13;
Policy. These approaches incorporate local people into PA management activities, benefit&#13;
sharing, and planning, and emphasize consideration of the needs and welfare of forest-&#13;
dwelling people.&#13;
B. Project Areas and Participants&#13;
2.3    Biogeographical Features. The seven project areas would include protected areas&#13;
(PAs) as well as villages in areas peripheral to the PA but within a 2 km. radius of the&#13;
PA's boundary. Five of the seven PAs are tiger reserves, which generally comprise&#13;
gazetted and proposed parks and sanctuaries, plus specified areas of reserve forests and&#13;
tourism zones. There are two PAs that are not tiger reserves: Nagarhole, which is a&#13;
Project Elephant reserve comprising a declared national park, and Gir, a declared national&#13;
park that has the world's only wild population of asiatic lions. The total land area of the&#13;
tiger reserves and national parks is 6714 sq. km., with 2014 sq. km. managed as core&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               8&#13;
areas. Individual PAs range in size from 643 to 1412 sq. km., with core areas ranging from&#13;
192 to 393 sq. km.&#13;
2.4   Demographic Features. About 427,000 villagers would participate in the project;&#13;
of these 89,000 currently live within the PAs (mostly in enclaves and other non-core parts&#13;
of tiger reserves where human settlement is allowed). About 39% of the participants&#13;
would be tribal. ). The number of participants range from 36,000 to 77,000 per PA. The&#13;
project would cover as many of the people living within 2 km. of the PA boundaries as&#13;
possible, within the limits of institutional capacity. The intensity of local people's impacts&#13;
on the PA provided the basis to select specific participating villages. Most of the village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments would take place in the periphery area. Annex 6 further&#13;
describes the project areas.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.5   The project would conserve biodiversity by implementing the ecodevelopment&#13;
strategy in and around seven protected areas (PAs) and would also include support for&#13;
preparing future biodiversity projects. The main objectives would be:&#13;
(a)   To improve capacity of PA management to conserve biodiversity and&#13;
increase opportunities for local participation in PA management activities&#13;
and decisions&#13;
(b)   To reduce negative impacts of local people on biodiversity, reduce negative&#13;
impacts of PAs on local people, and increase collaboration of local people&#13;
in conservation efforts&#13;
(c)   To develop more effective and extensive support for ecodevelopment&#13;
(d)   To ensure effective management of this project, and&#13;
(e)   To prepare future biodiversity projects.&#13;
D. Summary of Project Content&#13;
2.6   The US$67 million project would be implemented over a five-year period from&#13;
October 1996 through September 2001. The components correspond to the objectives&#13;
listed above and comprise:&#13;
(a)   Improved PA management (US$14 mln. - 22 % of the base costs):&#13;
(i)   improving PA planning processes and building capacity&#13;
(ii)   protecting and managing ecosystems and habitats within the PA&#13;
(iii)  upgrading PA amenities for field staff&#13;
(b)   Village ecodevelopment (US$34 mln. - 55 % of the base costs) that&#13;
reduces negative interactions of local people on biodiversity and increases&#13;
collaboration of local people in conservation by:&#13;
(i)   conducting participatory microplanning and providing&#13;
implementation support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               9&#13;
(ii)  implementing reciprocal commitments that foster alternative&#13;
livelihoods and resource uses to be financed by a village&#13;
ecodevelopment program and that specify measurable actions by&#13;
local people to improve conservation&#13;
(iii)  special programs for additional joint forest management, voluntary&#13;
relocation, and supplemental investments for special needs&#13;
(c)   Education &amp; awareness and impact monitoring &amp; research (US$5 min. - 8&#13;
% of the base costs) that develops more effective and extensive support for&#13;
PA ecodevelopment including:&#13;
(i)   promoting public support for conservation through environmental&#13;
education and awareness campaigns&#13;
(ii)  impact monitoring and research to improve understanding of issues&#13;
and solutions relevant to PA management and interactions between&#13;
PAs and people&#13;
(d)   Overallproject management (US$5 mln. 9 % of the base costs):&#13;
(e)   Preparation offuture biodiversity projects (US$2 mln. - 4 % of the base&#13;
costs):&#13;
(i)   Second Ecodevelopment Project&#13;
(ii)   Biodiversity Information Project&#13;
(iii)  Ex-situ Conservation Project, and&#13;
(f)   Reimbursement of the Project Preparation Facility (US$2 min. - 3 % of&#13;
the base costs).&#13;
E. Detailed Features&#13;
Improved PA Management&#13;
2.7   Improving PA Planning Processes and Building Capacity. The improved&#13;
planning processes and capacity building would use specialist advice, studies, workshops,&#13;
associated travel costs, and training containing two main parts:&#13;
(a)   To strengthen PA management plans and the capacity to implement the&#13;
plans&#13;
(i)    a two year updating process and skill building process would:&#13;
*     update PA management plans in conformity with current&#13;
guidelines&#13;
*     incorporate ecological considerations, including boundary&#13;
rationalization, buffer forest land management, and&#13;
broadening the focus of the plan to cover ecosystems in&#13;
addition to species&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                10&#13;
introduce processes and arrangements to broaden&#13;
participation and cooperation of local people and outside&#13;
groups, including increasing consultation, and developing&#13;
benefit sharing arrangements for PA byproducts and&#13;
enterprises&#13;
develop PA-specific financial sustainability strategies&#13;
incorporate initiatives supported under other project&#13;
components (e.g., village ecodevelopment, environmental&#13;
education strategies, research strategies, etc.).&#13;
(ii)  the component would also include support throughout the project&#13;
for training in PA management skills.&#13;
(b)   To incorporate PA concerns into regional planning and regulation, which&#13;
would involve.&#13;
(i)   early identification and assessment of existing and proposed&#13;
activities outside the scope of the project that might potentially&#13;
undermine effective biodiversity conservation of the PAs or&#13;
undermine implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy in and&#13;
around the PAs and&#13;
(ii)   strengthening the capacity for environmental site clearance and&#13;
monitoring of non-project activities using existing environmental&#13;
protection regulations and agreed best practice for environmental&#13;
assessment and resettlement.&#13;
2.8   Protecting and Managing Ecosystems and Habitats. During project&#13;
preparation, the PA authorities developed an indicative list of activities based on existing&#13;
plans and available information. The scope and nature of these activities differ from PA to&#13;
PA and in most cases would be very site specific. The broad categories of activities are:&#13;
(a)   Ecosystem and habitat restoration and&#13;
(b)   Improving fire, poaching, and animal control.&#13;
These activities would require inputs of restoration and control works, associated&#13;
supervision, communications equipment, a limited number of vehicles and boats, minor&#13;
access track improvements, fire watch towers, sign boards, boundary markers, and other&#13;
works and goods in accordance with recommendations of the PA management plans. The&#13;
updated PA management plans described above, once completed and cleared by the Bank,&#13;
would determine the specific content of investments in this subcomponent. However,&#13;
some investments in ecosystem protection and management would be required prior to the&#13;
likely completion of the PA management plan updating. In order to ensure that activities&#13;
implemented in the interim are sound and do not have a negative impact on biodiversity&#13;
and the environment, PA officials would demonstrate prior to implementation that the&#13;
activities would (a) conserve biodiversity; (b) be urgently needed; (c) not foreclose options&#13;
being considered for the updated PA management plans; (d) be consistent with existing&#13;
PA management plans; (e) be technically feasible; (f) not erode customary tenure rights of&#13;
tribals, and (g) be environmentally sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                11&#13;
2.9    Annex 7 describes details of the improved PA management planning processes,&#13;
clearance requirements, technical assistance, and training. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that planning and implementation of the ecosystem protection and&#13;
management investments would be in accordance with guidance agreed with IDA.&#13;
2.10   Upgrading Amenities for PA Staff. The selection of the seven PAs was premised&#13;
in part on the fact that these PAs already had good facilities and would not require&#13;
extensive infrastructure improvements. Nevertheless, some upgrading of the amenities for&#13;
lowest ranked PA staff, would be required and would comprise limited staff quarters for&#13;
the lowest ranked PA staff, patrol camps, and drinking water and electricity supplies for&#13;
some locations. In addition, career development training and field kits for staff would be&#13;
supported under the project.&#13;
Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
2.11   Microplanning and Implementation Support. Conducting participatory&#13;
microplanning and providing implementation support for reciprocal commitments would&#13;
use contracted local NGOs, expert advisors, workshops, materials, training (of&#13;
government officials, NGOs, and local people), and PA staff travel to:&#13;
(a)    Undertake participatory mutual interaction assessment of PA and local&#13;
people&#13;
(b)   Explain and consider the implications of the eligibility criteria, budget&#13;
constraints, local contribution requirements, and applications of traditional&#13;
natural resource management systems&#13;
(c)   Identify potential investments and activities which would mitigate negative&#13;
PA-people interactions&#13;
(d)   Analyze the financial, technical, institutional, and social feasibility of the&#13;
proposed programs&#13;
(e)    Strengthen capacity of implementing institutions (e.g. village groups, park&#13;
personnel, NGOs, etc.)&#13;
(f)    Confirm reciprocal microplan agreements that address negative interactions&#13;
of both PA and local people, and&#13;
(g)   Facilitate the review and implementation of the reciprocal commitments.&#13;
Teams comprising PA staff and local NGO staff (with each team including at least one&#13;
woman) would use specially focused participatory rural appraisal techniques, called a&#13;
protected area mutual interaction assessment (PAMIA). The PAMIA would facilitate&#13;
detailed village-level planning of reciprocal ecodevelopment commitments. These teams&#13;
would take special care to ensure that women, tribal groups, and other disadvantaged&#13;
people participate in the planning process and benefit from the agreed program. PA-level&#13;
ecologists, social scientists, and other specialists would provide advice and review the&#13;
proposed microplans to ensure that they met eligibility criteria. National-level specialists&#13;
would also review proposals presenting new or difficult issues. Annex 8 outlines&#13;
microplan procedures and contents in detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                12&#13;
2.12  Implementing the Reciprocal Commitments. Reciprocity would reside in the&#13;
mutual quid pro quo of (a) specific measurable actions by local people to improve&#13;
conservation and (b) investments that foster alternative resources use and livelihoods.&#13;
PRA surveys in sample communities in and around the PAs have enabled the project&#13;
preparation teams to identify an indicative list of possible ecodevelopment investments and&#13;
actions to improve conservation. Investments categories include: biomass substitution&#13;
(e.g. alternative fuels), biomass generation and forestry, ecotourism, agriculture including&#13;
watershed management, small irrigation and livestock, agro-processing, and artisanry.&#13;
These investment ideas need site-specific review to judge whether they meet eligibility&#13;
criteria, and other proposals may be identified during more detailed planning. Examples of&#13;
actions to improve conservation include curtailing grazing, curtailing fuelwood collection&#13;
within the PA, and increasing participation in anti-poaching efforts.&#13;
2.13  Investment Eligibility Criteria. The eligibility criteria specifies that village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments associated with the reciprocal commitments would:&#13;
(a)   Conserve biodiversity by reducing negative and increasing positive&#13;
interactions between people and PAs, either directly, or indirectly by&#13;
creating sufficient incentives for a consensus that commits local people to&#13;
specific, measurable actions that improve conservation (the other essential&#13;
element of the reciprocal commitment)&#13;
(b)   Mitigate the negative impacts of the previous establishment of the PAs on&#13;
vulnerable groups and ensure equitable distribution of benefits to&#13;
populations currently dependent on the PAs, especially tribals, women and&#13;
other disadvantaged people&#13;
(c)   Add supplemental resources, i.e., alternative sources of funding and&#13;
support is not available&#13;
(d)   Be technicallyfeasible, e.g., inputs and technical advice are adequate;&#13;
physical conditions are suitable&#13;
(e)   Befinanciallyfeasible, e.g., costs within norms or cleared by PA manager,&#13;
returns are sufficient to compensate for PA resources foregone, and for all&#13;
investments intended to produce cash revenue or benefits that can be&#13;
monetized, market linkages are adequate, cash flow requirements are&#13;
viable, and returns compare favorably with alternative investment options;&#13;
(f)    Be socially and institutionallyfeasible, e.g., associated activities are&#13;
culturally acceptable, local institutional capacity is adequate to organize&#13;
forest protection, distribute benefits from common resources, provide&#13;
physical maintenance, keep accounts, meet contribution requirements, etc.,&#13;
and&#13;
(g)   Be environmentally sustainable, e.g., adverse environmental impact of&#13;
exotic species, agro-chemicals, construction activity, can be ameliorated or&#13;
avoided.&#13;
(h)   Be selected and "owned" by EDCs, ensured through use of budget&#13;
constraint mechanism and contribution requirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 13&#13;
Village ecodevelopment investments associated with the reciprocal commitments must&#13;
meet all of the above criteria. Annex 8 describes the process and documentation required&#13;
to ensure that these criteria are met, including specific eligibility and feasibility&#13;
considerations. Annexes 17 and 18 provide further guidance on environmental and social&#13;
considerations.&#13;
2.14   Budget Constraints and Phasing The total costs of the ecodevelopment&#13;
investments that would be associated with reciprocal commitment would not exceed Rs.&#13;
10,000 (US$285) base costs per family, plus Rs. 500 (US$14) per family at preinvestment&#13;
(i.e., during initial microplanning) to establish credibility. The funding of the Rs. 10,000&#13;
per family would usually be spread out over a three year period, with one third of the total&#13;
resources available each year. The budget constraint per EDC would be calculated on a&#13;
per household basis, multiplied by the total number of households. For example, a forty-&#13;
family hamlet would make decisions within a binding budget constraint of Rs. 133,333&#13;
(US$3,800) for the first year, or Rs. 400,000 (US$11,400) over the three years. Annex 8&#13;
further explains the basis and arrangments for the budget constraint mechanism.&#13;
2.15   Contributions of Local People. Local people would contribute at least 25 percent&#13;
of the Rs. 10,000 per household village ecodevelopment investment in cash, kind, or labor.&#13;
Payment from project funds for the market value of contributions would be made available&#13;
to the local people for additional community investments.This arrangement would thus&#13;
help to extend the incentive mechanism beyond the period of the project investments.&#13;
Annex 8 describes further details of the arrangements for local contributions.&#13;
2.16   Special Programs. These programs would mostly take place outside the national&#13;
park and sanctuary boundaries but inside the 2 km periphery of the PAs, and would&#13;
comprise:&#13;
(a)    Supporting plantation activities under joint forest management (JFM) in&#13;
reserve forests in the immediate vicinity of PAs, beyond levels allowed&#13;
within ecodevelopment budget constraints, in order to maintain consistency&#13;
with JFM coverage elsewhere in the state&#13;
(b)   Developing the voluntary relocation option for people in the PAs in ways&#13;
that are consistent with project objectives and GOI and Bank policies (e.g.,&#13;
develop participatory operational plans, aid households in the transitional&#13;
period, provide investment funds for altemative livelihoods, provide&#13;
implementation support services, and support measures fostering cultural&#13;
continuity), and&#13;
4&#13;
(c)    Providing other supplemental investments through a discretionary reserve&#13;
for PA managers to allocate to areas with special needs (e.g., special&#13;
watershed management priorities in buffer areas, communities that are&#13;
especially dependent on forest resources, or village ecodevelopment&#13;
investment opportunities with economies of scale).&#13;
4&#13;
The discretionary reserve would not exceed 18% of the regular village ecodevelopment investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 14&#13;
2.17  Guidelines. It is important that all village ecodevelopment activities follow project&#13;
guidelines. Annex 8 provides detailed guidelines on the participatory microplanning&#13;
process, including a list of specific eligibility and feasibility considerations. Annex 18&#13;
provides an analytical framework to help ensure that vulnerable groups (indigenous&#13;
people, women, and other marginalized groups) would be full participants in project&#13;
decision-making and benefits. Annex 19 provides guidelines on programs fro people in the&#13;
PAs, including voluntary relocation. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
planning and implementation of reciprocal commitments, including associated investments,&#13;
would be in accordance with guidelines (including selection process, eligibility criteria,&#13;
feasibility considerations, acceptability of investment costs, budget constraint, and&#13;
beneficiary contribution requirement) agreed with IDA (consistent with Annexes 8, 18,&#13;
and 19). For each PA, SFDs would submit the first three proposals for village&#13;
ecodevelopment microplans (which could those developed during the PPF ) for approval&#13;
by IDA prior to the implementation of the microplans.&#13;
EducationNisitor Management and Impact Monitoring/Research&#13;
2.18   Education and Visitor Management. The project would provide local NGOs,&#13;
expert advisors, training, workshops, physical facilities, equipment, and materials for:&#13;
(a)    Environmental education and awareness to&#13;
(i)    Develop an environmental education and awareness strategy with&#13;
help from professional educators, communicators, scientists, social&#13;
scientists, NGOs and PA staff&#13;
(ii)   Improve visitor information and interpretation services&#13;
(iii)   Expand education programs for school children&#13;
(iv)   Run mass media campaigns&#13;
(v)   Develop alternative media&#13;
(b)    Visitor managment and ecotourism&#13;
(i)    Develop a visitor management and participatory ecotourism&#13;
strategy&#13;
(ii)   Implement agreed strategy.&#13;
2.19   Annex 9 describes the environmental education and visitor management activities&#13;
in detail.&#13;
2.20  Impact Monitoring and Research. Impact monitoring and research would&#13;
improve understanding of issues and solutions relevant to PA management and&#13;
interactions between PAs and people. It would involve the extensive use of contracted&#13;
institutions and individuals for implementation support, expert advice, and special studies.&#13;
It would also involve local people in participatory monitoring, and provide support for&#13;
5&#13;
Microplans proposed during the PPF could be implementated prior to these three proposals, provided&#13;
they meet guidelines outlined in February 1996 Bank mission Aide Memoire.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                15&#13;
improved facilities and equipment, training, workshops, transport, and materials. These&#13;
imports would support:&#13;
(a)   Ecological and socioeconomic monitoring to measure status and impacts&#13;
and to measure the effectiveness of project institutions and processes&#13;
(b)   Ecological research (e.g., human impact within PAs, ways to control&#13;
depredation by wildlife, impacts of fires and flood, ecosystem dynamics)&#13;
(c)    Socioeconomic research (e.g. long-term impacts of PAs on people,&#13;
ethnobiology, indigenous resource management systems, cultural heritage,&#13;
participatory processes, tenure requirements), and&#13;
(d)   Capacity building and communication programs to facilitate experimental&#13;
learning and demonstration, increase compatibility of approaches and&#13;
disseminate findings on above.&#13;
Annex 10 describes the impact monitoring and research activities in detail.&#13;
Project Management Component&#13;
2.21   This component would support the management organization and activities, i.e.,&#13;
the overhead, required to implement the overall project. Items in this component are not&#13;
solely associated with the individual components described above, but instead cover a&#13;
range of components. It would include:&#13;
(a)   Direct PA level management&#13;
(b)   Implementation strategy and guidelines&#13;
(c)   Multi-state learning and dissemination&#13;
(d)   Implementation review&#13;
(e)   National-level policy studies and&#13;
(f)    National level administration.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the national level project management&#13;
activities would be implemented in accordance with arrangements agreed with IDA.&#13;
Annex I I presents the terms of reference for the national-level technical assistance and the&#13;
indicative training program in project management.&#13;
Preparation of Future Biodiversity Projects&#13;
2.22  Overview. The Ecodevelopment Project would include preparation support&#13;
(including experts, studies, and workshops) for relatively large and comprehensive future&#13;
projects intended to strategically address India's priority biodiversity concems. The&#13;
Govemment has developed a list of three project concepts which potentially could meet&#13;
this criteria: Second Ecodevelopment, Biodiversity Information, and Genetic and Ex-situ&#13;
Conservation.&#13;
2.23   Second Ecodevelopment Project. In concept this project would be be a larger&#13;
scale, progamatic version of the current project, but also include a component addressing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 16&#13;
biodiversity conservation in multiple use areas. This preparation of this project would&#13;
involve:&#13;
(a)    Providing preparation guidance incorporating existing experience&#13;
(b)   Preparing detailed proposals for specific project areas of the Second&#13;
Ecodevelopment project&#13;
(c)    Appraising submitted proposals for the Second Ecodevelopment Project&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   Building capacity and consensus to lay a foundation for timely&#13;
implementation of the Second Ecodevelopment Project.&#13;
2.24   Biodiversity Information Project. The concept of this project would be to&#13;
organize a demand-driven system for biodiversity information that would:&#13;
(a)    Strengthen systems for gathering, organizing, and storing useful information&#13;
(b)    Strengthen distributed system for providing access to information and&#13;
(c)    Enhance analysis and application of information for decision-making.&#13;
2.25   Genetic and Ex-Situ Conservation Project. This project concept would&#13;
comprise a nationally-coordinated and user-oriented effort to:&#13;
(a)    Expand the stock of ex situ genetic resources, salvaging selected species and&#13;
genetic variability that would otherwise be lost if left in situ within protected or&#13;
multiple use areas&#13;
(b)    Strengthen the capacity to replicate, manipulate, and exchange genetic&#13;
resources&#13;
(c)   Improve safety, reliability, and efficiency of genetic resources management&#13;
(d)   Develop and establish a legal framework for ex situ conservation&#13;
(e)    Promote public awareness and education of ex situ genetic resources&#13;
conservation&#13;
2.26   Annex 12 further describes the projects concepts and preparation activities.&#13;

III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Project Cost Estimates&#13;
6&#13;
3.1    Total project costs are estimated at US $67 million (Rs. 294.9 crore ), inclusive of&#13;
duties and taxes in the amount of US $0.9 million (Rs. 3.9 crore). Of this 8 percent or US&#13;
$5.3 million are foreign exchange costs. Investment costs amount to 86 percent and&#13;
incremental recurrent costs to 14 percent of base costs. The base costs are those obtained&#13;
at the time of appraisal, adjusted for inflation to the date of negotiations. Physical&#13;
contingencies amount to 9 percent. Price contingencies reflect foreign inflation of 2.0, 2.3,&#13;
and four years at 2.5 percent, and local inflation of 8.0, 8.0, 7.5 and three years at 6.0&#13;
7&#13;
percent for the respective fiscal years of the project.&#13;

3.3    Relation of Cost Estimates to Annual Budgets. Cost estimates are indicative&#13;
only. They indicate the overall size of the project and amount of required financing but do&#13;
not provide an approved blueprint for specific expenditures. In the course of the project,&#13;
managers would allocate specific expenditures according to an annual work plan and&#13;
budget, which would be subject to a review process to ensure consistency with project&#13;
objectives. The updated PA management plans would determine the specific investment&#13;
during project years three to five for the protection and management of ecosystems&#13;
component. Annual budgets for the village ecodevelopment component would specify&#13;
only the location and unit size of the villages selected. Funds would then be allocated for&#13;
specific activities as agreed with village groups through participatory microplanning and&#13;
feasibility analysis, in conjunction with reciprocal commitments that promote conservation.&#13;
Strategies supports during the initial project period would also determine specific project&#13;
support for environmental education and monitoring and research activities.&#13;
B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.4   The financing plan below presents the IDA, GEF, project beneficiaries, GOS, and&#13;
GOI contributions for the five-year project period. The IDA Credit of US $28.0 million&#13;
equivalent would finance 42% of project costs, net of taxes. The GET Grant of US $20.0&#13;
million equivalent would finance 30% of project costs. The IDA and GEF financing is&#13;
allocated roughly on a pro-rata basis to all components except for the preparation of&#13;
future biodiversity projects and the reimbursement of the US$2 rnillion IDA Project&#13;
Preparation Facility). GOI and the GOSs would finance US $14.6 million. While this&#13;
financing would represent a significant increase in government resources devoted to&#13;
biodiversity conservation, it would be only a small share of the total budgets of the&#13;
participating state forest departments. Project beneficiaries would contribute US $4.4&#13;
million equivalent by contributing primarily labor to the ecodevelopment program.&#13;

C. Procurement&#13;
3.5    Procurement under the project would be undertaken by each state forestry&#13;
department, and for centrally managed activities, by the responsible MOEF office. Bulking&#13;
or grouping of contracts across states would not be practical because of the widely&#13;
dispersed nature of the project sites.&#13;
3.6    Civil Works. (US$7.4 million). Works would be procured following National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) or other procedures acceptable to IDA:&#13;
(a)       NCB. Civil works in the project consist mainly of the construction of&#13;
offices, residential quarters for forest guards, foresters, and range officers&#13;
in remote forest areas, a few quarters for forest officers in divisional&#13;
headquarters, and repairs of gravel forest tracks. Works to an aggregate&#13;
value of US$450,000 would be procured under contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. The justification for the NCB&#13;
for civil works is that they consist of works in widely scattered interior&#13;
locations, during the first three years of the project, and therefore could not&#13;
be grouped together into convenient packages that would attact foreign&#13;
firms. Nevetheless, bids from foreign contractors would not be precluded.&#13;
(b)    Other procedures acceptable to IDA. Small works valued at less than&#13;
US$20,000 would be procured by the respective state forest departments in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA: (i) under community&#13;
participation provisions by direct contracting with village communities or&#13;
non-governmental organizations; (ii) by soliciting quotations from at least&#13;
three qualified contractors; or (iii) through force account. Materials for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report              20&#13;
these works valued in aggregate at US $4.0 million would be procured&#13;
following national shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. Monitoring of&#13;
works would be done using procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.7   Vehicles and non-motorized transportation (US $0.8 million).Vehicles for the&#13;
project consist of four-wheel drive vehicles, minibuses, and boats. They would be required&#13;
in small numbers in widely dispersed areas over the project life of five years in contracts of&#13;
less than US $100,000. To meet these requirements, vehicles costing not more than&#13;
US$650,000 in the aggregate would be procured through national shopping procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Rate contracts of the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal&#13;
(DGS&amp;D), New Delhi, would only be acceptable as a substitute for procurement under&#13;
national shopping. Elephants and ponies to be used for anti-poaching, valued at about US&#13;
$100,000, would be obtained under direct contracting procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.8   Furniture and Equipment (US $1.9 million). Computers and the associated&#13;
software costing more than US$100,000 to an aggregate value of US$346,000 would be&#13;
procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The remaining&#13;
information technology, field, office, and laboratory equipment are required by the seven&#13;
states and spread over the project life of five years. Individual contracts are not likely to&#13;
exceed US $20,000 and hence are not suitable for competitive bidding. They would be&#13;
procured up to an aggregate amount of US $0.9 million through national shopping&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. Rate contracts of the (DGS&amp;D), New Delhi, would only&#13;
be acceptable as a substitute for procurement under national shopping. Satellite imagery,&#13;
aerial photography and maps up to an aggregate amount of about US$ 100,000 would be&#13;
procured directly from GOI agencies such as the National Remote Sensing Agency or the&#13;
Survey of India. Similarly, books and periodicals, proprietary software, extension and&#13;
publicity materials, valued at about US$0.5 million would be procured under direct&#13;
contracting procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.9   Ecodevelopment Investments (US$30.5 million). Investment expenditures would&#13;
finance small works and village development activities in 2,000 widely scattered EDC&#13;
locations over the five-year project period. Procedures acceptable to IDA for management&#13;
of the investments, including planning, the selection process, eligibility criteria, would be&#13;
utilized (Annex 8). Civil works required for these investments would be procured in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA: (i) under community participation&#13;
provisions by direct contracting with village communities or non-governmental&#13;
organizations; (ii) by soliciting quotations from at least three qualified contractors; or (iii)&#13;
through force account. Construction materials for these works, aggregating to about US&#13;
$13.0 million, would be procured following national shopping procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA. Small equipment and goods required for these investments would be procured&#13;
through national shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. Livestock, including breeding&#13;
stock, young animals, fertile eggs for hatching, bees, and silk worms, estimated to cost US&#13;
$800,000 would be obtained under direct contracting procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.10  Consultancies, Studies, Training (US $12.1 million). Consultancy services&#13;
estimated at US $6.0 million with consulting firms (mainly large NGOs) and US $4.2&#13;
million with individuals for management support, implementation assistance and special&#13;
studies would be contracted on terms and conditions in accordance with IDA guidelines&#13;
for the use of consultants ("Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, August, 1981") Consultancy services in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               21&#13;
contracts less than US $20,000 (mainly small NGOs) up to an aggregate of US $1.6&#13;
million for participatory planning and implementation assistance with Village&#13;
Ecodevelopment would be contracted on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (Annex&#13;
14). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOSs would select NGOs in&#13;
accordance with criteria agreed with IDA (Annex 14). Training estimated to cost US $1.1&#13;
million, including a service contract for placement and support of trainees would be&#13;
procured using governmental/administrative procedures acceptable to IDA. Detailed&#13;
training plans are presented in Annexes 7, 8, and 11.&#13;
3.11  Project management travel costs (US $0.7 million) that would include&#13;
transportation for project managers, staff and EDC members to supervise project&#13;
investments and attend planning workshops that would be financed under the project.&#13;
3.12  Incremental recurrent costs (US $9.0), including staff, the purchase of office and&#13;
computer supplies, and incremental maintenance costs of vehicles and equipment, would&#13;
be financed by the GOS and procured by standard GOS procedures.&#13;
3.13 Procurement Review. All ICB and.NCB contracts for works and goods&#13;
exceeding US$100,000 and the first NCB contract for goods or works in each State&#13;
would be subject to prior review by IDA. In respect to consultancies, (i) the model&#13;
docujments for inviting proposals, (ii) terms of reference for consultant contracts&#13;
regardless of value (including NGOs and autonomous government organizations), (iii) all&#13;
single source contracts regardless of value (not applicable to contracts for individuals),&#13;
(iv) all contracts for assignments of a critical nature (regardless of value), and (v) all&#13;
contracts (original or amendments) valued at more than US $100,000 awarded to firms, or&#13;
US $50,000 or more awarded to individuals, would be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
This would result in prior review of about 10 percent of all contracts procured. Contracts&#13;
below the threshold levels would be subject to selective post-review by visiting missions.&#13;
In addition, a nationally recognized auditing firm would be engaged for a random post-&#13;
review of 10% of the Ecodevelopment Support Investments. Reviews of the&#13;
Ecodevelopment Support Investments would concentrate on the consistency of the&#13;
investments with the selection and eligibility criteria, agreed procurement procedures,&#13;
competitiveness of prices paid and physical inspections of the relevant items. Although this&#13;
would result in only about 15 percent of project expenditures being subject to prior&#13;
review, the nature of the project, with its emphasis on ecodevelopment programs managed&#13;
and implemented by villagers and NGOs, is such that a higher level of IDA review would&#13;
not have a significant impact on procurement quality.&#13;
3.14  Procurement Information. Procurement information will be collected and&#13;
recorded as follows:&#13;
(a)   Contract award information will be promptly reported by the borrower&#13;
(b)   Comprehensive half-yearly reports will be prepared by the borrowers in the&#13;
format presented in Annex 16&#13;
(c)   Compliance with aggregate limits on the specified methods of procurement&#13;
(d)   Preparation of a completion report by the borrower within three months of&#13;
the loan closing date&#13;
&#13;

3.16 Contractual Arrangements. Prior to negotiations, MOEF and SFDs, following&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA, ,have contracted or are in the process of contracting NGOs&#13;
and professionals to implement PPF activities and have a time-bound plan on which they&#13;
have begun action to prepare final terms of reference and final design and tender&#13;
documents for works and goods to be procured through the first fiscal year of the project.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (i) procurement of works, goods,&#13;
consultancy services would be in accordance with Bank guidelines; and (ii) standard&#13;
procurement documents as already agreed with GOI would be used.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
3.17    Disbursements under the Credit would be made for:&#13;
(a)      40%  of civil works for building and roads&#13;

(e)   40% of project management travel.&#13;
3.19  Disbursements against goods and works contracts over US $100,000, and all&#13;
consultant contracts that require prior review, including contracts exceeding US $100,000&#13;
equivalent for firms and US $50,000 equivalent for individuals, would be fully&#13;
documented. Disbursements for all other expenditures would be made against statements&#13;
of expenditure (SOEs). Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by GOI&#13;
and the GOSs and be made available to Association staff during supervision.&#13;
3.20  MOEF and FDs have already commenced activities to expedite project start-up,&#13;
not all of which are financed under the PPF. To remiburse the Government for such&#13;
expenditures, retroactive financing would be applied to all eligible expenditures for project&#13;
activities not already eligible for PPF fianancing, incurred after December 31, 1995, up to&#13;
a maximum of SDR 1.4 million (US $2 million equivalent) from IDA and SDR 1.4 million&#13;
9&#13;
Includes payments for travel and subsistence of government staff to workshops and meetings,&#13;
honoraria for external specialists and facilitators, and contracts with NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               24&#13;
(US$2 millioin equivalent) from GEF. All contracts and items to be financed retroactively&#13;
will have been procured in a manner acceptable to the Association. Disbursements are&#13;
projected over a period of six GOI fiscal years, from 96/97 through 01/02. The&#13;
disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 14. The completion date would be December&#13;
31, 2001. The closing date of the Credit would be June 30, 2002.&#13;
3.21  To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a special account in US dollars would be established in the Reserve Bank of&#13;
India, with an authorized allocation of US$2 million for IDA and US$2 million for GEF,&#13;
which is equal to the estimated four monthly average disbursement. The state forest&#13;
departments would submit withdrawal applications directly to the Controller of Aid&#13;
Accounts, DEA, sending copies to MOEF. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
GOI and the GOSs would implement a system satisfactory to IDA for channeling funds&#13;
required for carrying out the project. Paragraphs 4.8--4.13 provide further guidance on&#13;
flow of funds.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.19  The respective MOEF offices and each state government would establish a&#13;
separate project account. This account together with supporting documentation, including&#13;
contributions from GOI and the Credit, would provide a comprehensive record of project&#13;
financing and expenditures. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that this account&#13;
and the special account would be subject to normal GOI and GOS accounting procedures&#13;
and controls. Project accounts would summarize project expenditures under categories to&#13;
be agreed with IDA, showing: (a) actual versus planned expenditures for each quarter; (b)&#13;
actual versus planned expenditures accumulated to date; and (c) financing source for the&#13;
quarter, and accumulated, by IDA and the GOSs. The summaries, which would provide&#13;
information for the SOEs would form part of the project account, including those&#13;
expenditures for which reimbursement would be claimed with full documentation. The&#13;
project accounts would be supported by a listing with the withdrawal applications&#13;
submitted for the period. They would be audited annually in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles. The Controller and Auditor General and his accountants general at the&#13;
state levels would be considered acceptable auditors. The consolidated audited project&#13;
accounts, including the special account and SOEs, and the auditors' reports, which would&#13;
include a separate statement on the SOEs and certified copies of the SOEs, would be&#13;
submitted to IDA not later than nine months after the close of the fiscal year. The audit&#13;
report on SOEs would specifically comment on their usage and the controls established to&#13;
ensure their accuracy. The special account that would be maintained by the Department of&#13;
Economic Affairs (DEA) would show all withdrawal requests disbursed, amounts&#13;
advanced and reimbursed by IDA, and the balance at the end of each accounting period.&#13;
Auditor's reports would reflect the certification of the balance held by the Reserve Bank&#13;
of India. The GOSs would prepare a project report on a biannual basis, in a format agreed&#13;
with IDA, summarizing project progress in physical terms by project objectives, linked to&#13;
financial terms that would be based on the biannual unaudited project accounts.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Staffing and Organizational Structure&#13;
4.1    Organizational Responsibilities. Project management would use and build upon&#13;
existing forest department, inter-agency, NGO, and community organizational structures,&#13;
modifying them where necessary to ensure autonomy, flexibility, and accountability. State&#13;
governments, through their PA authorities, would be responsible for field level project&#13;
execution. For many project activities, the PA authorities would develop partnerships with&#13;
or delegate to NGOs and village groups. PA authorities would also contract tasks to&#13;
individual specialists, professional research and training institutions and other groups and&#13;
involve existing district coordination committees. At the national level, the project would&#13;
need strong coordinating support to provide overall project integration. National NGOs,&#13;
professional institutes, and contracted specialists would play major roles. Except for the&#13;
project preparation component, it is anticipated that the project would not require foreign&#13;
consultancies. Annex 15 further describes the allocation of responsibilities by component.&#13;
4.2   Staffing. The staffing plans generally rely on increasing the productivity of existing&#13;
staff already based in the PAs. However, in some cases the state govemments propose to&#13;
redeploy a limited number of departmental staff who currently are based outside the PAs,&#13;
and to create new contractual positions. The state forest departments have provided&#13;
documentation that the staff plan, including planned internal transfers and the assignment&#13;
of project responsibilities to existing staff would not adversely affect the adequacy of&#13;
staffing of existing, non-project conservation activities. At the national level, MOEF&#13;
would expand existing offices to handle the project work. MOEF would in turn be assisted&#13;
by outside consultancies (including NGOs). In order to support sustainability, the project&#13;
would not include external financing for any government staff. Annex 15 provides further&#13;
information on the staffing plans. Prior to negotiations, the state governments and MOEF&#13;
finalized their respective staff plans for the PAs and PTO, and filled positions required for&#13;
the implementation of PPF activities. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
state governments and MOEF would:&#13;
(a)   Fill all positions required for the project by July 31, 1997&#13;
(b)   Ensure that no more than 33% of the senior executive field staff (i.e., all&#13;
staff above range officer level) of the project PAs, under normal&#13;
circumstances, would be transferred in any one year of the project.&#13;
4.3    Consultant Contracting. Because of the importance of specialists and NGO&#13;
partnerships to timely project inception prior to negotiations, the SFDs and MOEF:&#13;
(a)   Following procedures acceptable to IDA, contracted or were in the process&#13;
of contracting NGOs, professional institutions, and private consultants&#13;
required for the implementation of PPF activities&#13;
(b)   Had a time-bound plan on which they had begun action to prepare final&#13;
terms of reference, requests for proposals, short lists, and draft contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               26&#13;
for consultants including NGOs to be contracted through the first fiscal&#13;
year of the project, using model documents, and obtain approval by IDA.&#13;
4.4   Village-Level Operations. Village institutions for microplanning would be&#13;
relatively small and homogeneous villages or hamlets (preferably less than 100&#13;
households) in which all households are represented in the decision-making body by both&#13;
men and women. They would not necessarily correspond to the panchayat (municipal)&#13;
structure, due to their smaller size and differences between administrative and natural&#13;
resource management boundaries. Where possible, the ecodevelopment committee would&#13;
build on or use existing forest protection committees or other appropriate committees&#13;
already existing, provided these committees are composed of all forest-dependent&#13;
members of the village/hamlet and include women representatives from each household as&#13;
well as men. Initial village ecodevelopment investments can proceed without a formal legal&#13;
framework, but for large-scale implementation of the village ecodevelopment program,&#13;
states will need to have an appropriate government order consistent with project design.&#13;
Annex 8 outlines the minimum requirements for government orders. Prior to negotiations,&#13;
each state government drafted a government order on village ecodevelopment and were in&#13;
the process of considering suggested improvements. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the state governments would adopt government orders on village&#13;
ecodevelopment consistent with project design by September 31, 1998.&#13;
4.5   PA Committee Structure. Each PA is making its own arrangements to manage&#13;
and coordinate the project activities in accordance with its local conventions. The PAs&#13;
would make an explicit effort to expand their composition beyond government employees&#13;
and to include representatives from a range of outside specialists and stakeholders&#13;
including NGOs.&#13;
4.6   National Committees. The Project would have two national- level committees.&#13;
(a)   The Ecodevelopment Project Steering Committee, comprised of senior&#13;
MOEF and SFD officials and representatives of NGO and other institutions&#13;
contracted for national-level support, would&#13;
(i)   facilitate Center-State coordination, and&#13;
(ii)   provide policy guidance on project activities and work plans, and&#13;
(iii)  address conflicts related to application of project guidelines and&#13;
compliance with project covenants that have not been otherwise&#13;
resolved by SFD or MOEF officials.&#13;
(b)   The Ecodevelopment Project Implementation Board (EPIB) would be an&#13;
empowered body assigned full financial and administrative powers&#13;
necessary:&#13;
(i)   for program planning and implementation, and&#13;
(ii)  to ensure that the necessary governmental approvals are processed&#13;
expediently within the MOEF.&#13;
Annex 15 provides further information on committee structure and functions. As a&#13;
condition of negotiation, MOEF has established the above committees with terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               27&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA. As a condition of negotiation GOI and GOSs have&#13;
obtained all the necessary governmental clearances.&#13;
4.7   Training. The project proposal for its various components includes careful&#13;
consideration of training needs and many provisions for training of government staff, local&#13;
communities and other project participants. The training activities would include:&#13;
specially designed short courses, fellowships to existing domestic degree programs, study&#13;
tours, on-the-job training by experts, and a very limited number of overseas training&#13;
programs. Prior to negotiations, GOI and GOSs prepared detailed training plans organized&#13;
according to project objective for the first fiscal year of the project. Assurances were&#13;
obtained that GOI and GOSs would ensure that (a) recipients of the fellowships or degree&#13;
programs, on completion of their program, would be placed in job positions for a&#13;
minimum of three years where they could make full use of their training and (b) that staff&#13;
selected for the fellowship or degree programs or for overseas training would have at least&#13;
five years to retirement, except under circumstances acceptable to IDA. Text and tables&#13;
describing the indicative plans for specific content, recipients, methodology and&#13;
institutional arrangements of training are specified in accordance with the relevant project&#13;
components in Annexes 7, 8 and 1 1.&#13;
B. Flow of Funds and Work Plans&#13;
4.8   Overview. The innovative nature of the Ecodevelopment Project would require a&#13;
management structure with the authority and competence to channel funds in a timely&#13;
manner and to adapt the project work program and future project proposals in response to&#13;
performance, lessons learned, and design improvements. The management will therefore&#13;
need a high degree of flexibility in appointing staff and consultants, strong professional&#13;
expertise, and access to good information on program activities, accomplishments, and&#13;
problems.&#13;
4.9   Additionality. The sum of annual GOI and external financing that would comprise&#13;
this centrally sponsored scheme represents a significant increase of the MOEF total "plan"&#13;
(i.e., expenditures other than salaries and maintenance) budget, an increase of about 10%&#13;
above 1995/96 levels. The project expenditures in the PAs also represent a significant&#13;
increase in total expenditures of the state forest department wildlife wings. Under GOI's&#13;
budget system, the entire amount of external aid is added to the normal plan resources (net&#13;
budgetary support) to obtain the overall budget allocation for any particular sector. Tables&#13;
in Annex 2 present data on FY94/95 - FY96/97 actual and planned expenditures of MOEF&#13;
plan budget line items affecting biodiversity, and FY94/95 - FY96/97 actual and planned&#13;
expenditures for project PAs and their respective state forest department wildlife wings.&#13;
These data provide the baseline information to be used in an exchange of information on&#13;
biodiversity expenditures at the national, state, and PA levels in semi-annual progress&#13;
reports.&#13;
4.10  Work Plans and Budgets. Assurances were obtained that MOEF would:&#13;
(a)   submit to IDA for comment a preliminary annual work plan, which would&#13;
include updated cost tables, training, contracting plans, and other items as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               28&#13;
agreed with the Bank by September 30, 1997, and on an annual basis&#13;
thereafter,&#13;
(b)   furnish to IDA the final annual work plan proposals, taking into account&#13;
comments of IDA by January 31, 1998, and on an annual basis thereafter&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   implement the final annual work plans.&#13;
MOEF would adjust the preliminary work plan and determine the final work plan&#13;
proposals (which would still be subject to Parliament approval), based on comments from&#13;
the Bank, views of the Planning Commission and a review of the April-September semi-&#13;
annual progress reports. To avoid delays in the implementation of microplans, the annual&#13;
work plans would not include the microplans of individual hamlets, but would include&#13;
estimates of the facilitation support and hamlet coverage required for the village&#13;
ecodevelopment component.&#13;
4.11   Fund Advance Terms. As a centrally sponsored scheme, all funds to the PAs&#13;
would flow through MOEF to the state governments. The proceeds of the credit and grant&#13;
would be advanced to the seven states participating in the project, under standard&#13;
arrangements for developmental assistance for centrally sponsored schemes in India.&#13;
Under current policies and regulations of Government of India (GOI), fund advances take&#13;
the form of 100% grant.&#13;
4.12  Release of Funds. Release of funds to the states, with immediate forwarding to&#13;
PAs, would occur three times annually: by May 15, June 30, and August 31. Annex 15&#13;
further describes the flow of funds arrangements and includes charts outlining the flow of&#13;
funds structure and the schedule of annual planning, budgeting, sanctioning, and fund&#13;
flow.&#13;
4.13  Requirements for Effective Flow of Funds. Based on the Project Tiger and&#13;
externally financed projects, the following arrangements would be essential:&#13;
(a)   Timely provision of project resources provided with state counterpart&#13;
budget (i.e., staff and recurrent operating expenses)&#13;
(b)   Minimal or no lapse in cash flow between one fiscal year and the next&#13;
(c)   Delegation of powers permitting PA staff to make payments for certain&#13;
types of project investments (especially the village ecodevelopment fund),&#13;
based on clear criteria and procedures, and&#13;
(d)   Flexibility allowing PA managers to make adjustments between budget&#13;
heads in response to project monitoring results.&#13;
Standard terms and condition for flow of funds at the national and state levels allow for&#13;
the flow of fund arrangements specified in Annex 15. The schedule and conditions&#13;
specified in Annex 15 would be considered project performance benchmarks for this&#13;
aspect of project administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               29&#13;
4.14  Prior to negotiations, GOI and GOSs demonstrated that they had channels&#13;
acceptable to IDA for PPF and project flow (including meeting the requirements described&#13;
above) by:&#13;
(a)   Documenting that existing channels meet the requirements and have&#13;
functioned effectively either for Project Tiger activities or for other&#13;
externally financed PA investments, and&#13;
(b)   Using the selected channels successfully for PPF activities.&#13;
C. Project Performance Review&#13;
4.15  Conceptual Approach. The project includes both permanent impact monitoring&#13;
and project performance review of limited duration; the later is integral to project&#13;
management. Both programs would provide feedback and accountability to assist in&#13;
problem-solving and project adjustment. The performance reviews would incorporate&#13;
findings from impact monitoring and research component to the extent these are available,&#13;
but would mostly have to rely on shorter-term "proxy" measures of project inputs,&#13;
outputs, and processes. Process would be measured by the extent to which the project&#13;
follows its design specifications. An adaptive management approach would require quick&#13;
incorporation of lessons learned from these reviews. The project also includes support for&#13;
a special expenditure and procurement review, and an overall independent review.&#13;
4. 16  Semi-Annual Reports. The PA field directors, directors of the MOEF offices, and&#13;
contracted review specialists would be responsible for ensuring that progress reports&#13;
efficiently provide the information required for sound and timely management decisions.&#13;
Regional and national institutions would provide background data to supplement the&#13;
internally-generated information, and would review and comment on the semi-annual&#13;
progress reports of project performance and the yearly work plans. The progress reporting&#13;
would incorporate findings from the impact monitoring and research component. Annex&#13;
16 further explains the project approach to project performance review and presents an&#13;
outline of progress report contents. As a condition of negotiation, GOI and GOSs have&#13;
(a) prepared a conceptual framework for impact monitoring (Annex 10) and project&#13;
performance review (Annex 16) acceptable to IDA, (b) proposed guidelines for project&#13;
progress reporting including performance monitoring indicators (Annex 16) and are in the&#13;
process of developing the format and (c) developed a list of project performance&#13;
benchmarks (Annex 16). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that MOEF would&#13;
submit to IDA progress reports, in a format acceptable to IDA, on a semi-annual basis, by&#13;
June 30 and December 31, beginning in June 1997, and use performance monitoring&#13;
indicators agreed with IDA.&#13;
4.17  Supervision. A Bank mission would supervise the project semi-annually. In&#13;
addition to the Bank task manager, the mission team would regularly include at least one&#13;
biologist and one anthropologist and, occasionally, include additional technical, financial&#13;
and institutional experts. In the interest of overall portfolio management efficiency and cross-&#13;
fertilization of individual state experiences, the Ecodevelopment Project supervision would also&#13;
integrate the supervision of the ecodevelopment components in Tamil Nadhu and Himachal&#13;
Pradesh under the Forest Research Education and Extension Project. Each mission would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                30&#13;
include field visits to about three project sites plus a national consultation meeting that would&#13;
include representatives from the seven project sites plus the two FREEP sites. Project staff&#13;
from those sites not receiving a field visit would participate in the field visits to one of the other&#13;
sites. Members of the national-level implementation review team contracted under the project&#13;
would visit each PA at least twice a year and also participate in the supervision missions. This&#13;
arrangement would enable each site to receive a Bank supervision about every 18 months, and&#13;
project staff from each state to meet with Bank supervision team to review a field situation&#13;
every six months. This arrangement would also encourage mutual sharing and cross-&#13;
fertilization across states and build domestic capacity for implementation review.&#13;
4.18   Mid-Term Review. In the middle of the third year of the project, the project&#13;
managers and the PTO, with the assistance of the implementation review specialists,&#13;
would prepare a mid-term Review. It would provide the opportunity to officially adjust&#13;
project benchmarks and to make other changes in project design if necessary. It would&#13;
provide a channel for reporting initial measurements of longer-term project impacts. It&#13;
would influence the design of the Second Ecodevelopment Project. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the project managers in the PAs and the PTO would prepare&#13;
a mid-term review not later than June 30, 1999 in accordance with guidance agreed by&#13;
IDA, and would promptly carry out the recommendations of this review.&#13;
4.19  Completion Report. Within six months of project completion, the project&#13;
managers and the PTO would prepare a project completion report on the basis of&#13;
Government, Bank and GEF guidelines.&#13;
4.20   Other Reviews and Evaluation Studies. The project would have independent&#13;
reviews to assess project activities. The impact monitoring and research component would&#13;
provide the foundation for long-term evaluation, including baseline studies.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.21   Annex 16 includes the project implementation schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               31&#13;
V. PROJECT IMPACTS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Benefits and Outputs&#13;
5.1   Basic Benefits. The project would conserve globally significant biodiversity in the&#13;
seven PAs and develop capacity for increased conservation in the future. The project&#13;
would slow, halt, or possibly even reverse declines in the richness, complexity, diversity,&#13;
connectivity, and regeneration of ecosystems and species.&#13;
5.2   Outputs. The project would increase the capacity of government officials to&#13;
manage PAs effectively, addressing not only internal operations but also proposed and&#13;
existing periphery and regional activities that impact the PAs. It would increase local&#13;
people's support for and role in PA conservation. It would create organizational processes&#13;
that could be expanded to other ecologically significant areas. More specifically, it would:&#13;
(a)   Broaden the focus of PA management planning, restore ecosystems,&#13;
improve fire and poaching control, and improve staff efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness&#13;
(b)   Enable communities to meet their needs in an environmentally sustainable&#13;
manner, reduce unsustainable uses of PA resources, offset negative&#13;
economic and cultural impacts of PAs on local communities, and resolve&#13;
conflicts;&#13;
(c)   Provide a firmer base of public support for PAs and increase understanding&#13;
of PA biodiversity, local people, and their interactions&#13;
(d)   Provide the technical review and administrative and financial services&#13;
necessary for quality control, accountability, adaptive management,&#13;
improvement of the long-term framework, dissemination, integration, and&#13;
overall timeliness of project implementation.&#13;
(e)   Produce a portfolio of biodiversity project proposals eligible for GEF, IDA,&#13;
and other donor consideration.&#13;
Annex 21 describes these outputs in greater detail, and also describes the project approach&#13;
to measuring benefits, consideration of alternatives, the public sector role, cost recovery,&#13;
and fiscal impact.&#13;
B. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.3   Project Investments. This project would have a highly beneficial environmental&#13;
impact. The main goal of the project is to conserve critical biodiversity in seven selected&#13;
PAs. Adverse impacts would be minimal because all infrastructure investments would be&#13;
small and labor-intensive. To further ensure minimal impact, the preparation team has&#13;
reviewed the current operational procedures and guidelines for construction and&#13;
maintenance and found that they would provide adequate safeguards. In order to measure&#13;
project success, the project monitoring would include close review of the ecological&#13;
impact of the project, beginning with carefully designed and reliable baseline studies. .&#13;
Biodiversity considerations including ecosystem integrity would also be central in village&#13;
ecodevelopment eligibility criteria and in defining associated obligations, as well as in park&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               32&#13;
management investments. The project also includes provision of ecologists who would&#13;
review annual work plans and selected site-specific proposals on an ongoing basis&#13;
throughout the project period. Annex 17 provides a further summary of the environmental&#13;
analysis.&#13;
5.4   Regional Impacts. Assurances were obtained that GOI and GOSs would take&#13;
steps acceptable to the Bank to ensure that activities outside the scope of the project&#13;
would not undermine effective biodiversity conservation in the PAs or undermine&#13;
implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy in and around the PAs. Annex 7 describes&#13;
specific criteria and procedures for the compliance of this assurance.&#13;
C. Social Impact&#13;
Tribal Groups, Women, and Disadvantaged People&#13;
5.5   Social Assessment. The project would operate in a setting where the previous&#13;
establishment of PAs and changes in forest use have already significantly and negatively&#13;
affected the livelihoods of tribal groups living in and around the PAs. The establishment of&#13;
PAs has also negatively affected other disadvantaged groups. These groups include&#13;
women (who for example, harvest most of the non-timber forest products) and poor and&#13;
landless households in the vicinity of the PAs. In this setting, the project would engage in&#13;
participatory decisions on behavior changes to benefit conservation and to help offset past&#13;
negative impacts of PAs on people (see Annex 8). Findings from the participatory rural&#13;
appraisals conducted by teams of state forestry officials and local NGOs identified specific&#13;
potential impacts that the project could have on tribals, women and other disadvantaged&#13;
groups. Annex 18 presents a comprehensive social assessment of the project.&#13;
5.6   Tribal Concerns Integral to Project Design. Consistent with the Bank's&#13;
Operational Directive 4.20, tribal development concerns are central to the project. The&#13;
project would integrate tribal concerns rather than treating them as a subsidiary tribal&#13;
development plan or component. The area-specific planning, commitments, and&#13;
monitoring would address concerns of legal and usufruct rights and status, traditional&#13;
economies, cultural use of natural resources, livelihood strategies, ability to adapt to new&#13;
sites and economies, attitudes toward conservation, and social distribution of project&#13;
investments and benefits foregone. Annex 19 lists references in the staff appraisal report&#13;
(SAR) annexes that further analyze prerequisites and elements specified by Operational&#13;
Directive 4.20. Annex 18 includes extensive analysis of potential project impacts on tribal&#13;
people and suggests design measures to address special concerns of tribal people.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOI and GOSs ensure that project&#13;
activities would not erode customary tenure rights over land and other assets of tribals&#13;
living in the project areas.&#13;
People in the PAs&#13;
5.7   Current Situation. All seven PAs have people living within the PA boundaries.&#13;
Most live in areas where human settlement is allowed. People living in the PAs have&#13;
already experienced losses and without the project they would face very limited and bleak&#13;
options. At the same time, population pressures are adversely affecting PA conservation.&#13;
To address and ameliorate existing conditions, SFDs and some PA residents have started&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report              33&#13;
discussions on the possibility of participatory voluntary relocation. These discussions&#13;
indicate a strong demand for relocation from some individuals but the number of potential&#13;
participants is not yet clear. (Initial impressions indicate that it would be between 700 and&#13;
4,000 people.)&#13;
5.8   Relocation Strategy. The project would provide support for a participatory&#13;
process to plan and implement "voluntary relocation". Relocation under the project&#13;
would be "voluntary" in the sense that it would be driven by the wishes of local people.&#13;
Planning would take place in the context of options that would not involve relocation.&#13;
Relocation would be to lands on the periphery of the PAs, rather than to distant, non-&#13;
forest lands. The forest department would not cause or carry out involuntary relocation in&#13;
the project areas. All relocation planning and implementation associated with the project&#13;
would be consistent with Bank guidelines, and implementation would require prior Bank&#13;
approval. In addition to providing support for voluntary relocation, the project would&#13;
include special efforts to identify and provide village ecodevelopment investments (subject&#13;
to eligibility criteria outlined in paragraph 2.13 above) for people who do not wish to&#13;
relocate.&#13;
5.9   Assurances. For all activities dealing with people in the project area that take&#13;
place immediately prior to and during the project period, assurances were obtained at&#13;
appraisal and were reconfirmed at negotiations that the state governments would:&#13;
(a)   In pursusing the objectives of the Project, not carry out any involuntary&#13;
resettlement for any people resident within the PAs&#13;
(b)   Ensure that any proposals for voluntary relocation would be prepared and&#13;
implemented in accordance with criteria agreed with IDA and after prior&#13;
approval of IDA&#13;
(c)   For people who opt to remain in the PAs, prepare an indicative list of&#13;
appropriate village ecodevelopment investments acceptable to IDA, which&#13;
meets project criteria, and include these people in the village&#13;
ecodevelopment program&#13;
(d)   Adopt an explicit strategy and plan for sustainable encroachment control&#13;
acceptable to IDA before making proposals for programs of voluntary&#13;
relocation.&#13;
Non-project activities, including those related to resettlement, would be subject to the&#13;
regional impacts covenant (see paragraph 5.4).&#13;
5.10 Annex 20 provides additional analysis and guidelines on the people in PAs issue&#13;
and related project activities, including an outline of criteria and procedures for voluntary&#13;
relocation.&#13;
D. Sustainability&#13;
5.11  By enabling forest departments to share conservation responsibilities with local&#13;
communities, the project would improve the PAs' chances of long-term survival.&#13;
Successful implementation of project processes and incentives that would ensure this&#13;
sharing will therefore be crucial. Sustainability would also depend on the design of&#13;
administrative arrangements, and on maintaining the momentum of the ecodevelopment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                34&#13;
approach. The use of permanent organizational structures, and the preclusion of external&#13;
financing for government staff salaries would contribute to sustainability. Efforts to&#13;
increase public support for PAs, to provide tangible measures of project benefits and to&#13;
explore the potential of trust fund financing and other revenue, would increase prospects&#13;
for more adequate long-term financing from a variety of sources.&#13;
E. Risks&#13;
5.12  Risks. The project has significant risks. The degree of risk varies according to the&#13;
extent of innovation in each component. The village ecodevelopment component has the&#13;
highest level of risk, both because it uses novel planning processes and because there is&#13;
little hard data on the impact of comparable programs. The environmental education&#13;
component is the least risky. In spite of the risks, the project should proceed, because of&#13;
the importance of conserving biodiversity, the critical role of local people in conservation,&#13;
and the potential of this project to provide the foundation for long-term solutions to&#13;
India's challenging problems.&#13;
5.13   Risk Factors. Significant risk factors include:&#13;
(a)   Pressures of population growth, poverty, and commercial interests&#13;
(b)   Dangers of unrealistic expectations in the context of high profile attention&#13;
(c)   Time and commitment required to achieve participation and trust&#13;
(d)   Limitations in implementation capacity (both supply of technical expertise&#13;
and experience with process-oriented design)&#13;
(e)   Inadequate management support.&#13;
5.14  Measures to Address Risk Factors. Although it is not possible to fully address&#13;
problems of population growth, poverty, and commercial interests, the project includes&#13;
activities, institutional mechanisms, and a legal covenant designed to address regional&#13;
issues. To reduce the risk of the project being blamed by association for negative trends&#13;
and unmet needs, project objectives clearly emphasize "reduction" not "elimination" of&#13;
negative impacts. Project preparation has included extensive efforts to communicate&#13;
project objectives, and monitoring assessment criteria would further specify realistic&#13;
expectations. To encourage government commitment to participation, the project would&#13;
allocate financing according to a continuing review of work plans and progress reports&#13;
and avoid a blueprint approach. To allow trust to develop among local communities, the&#13;
project would use participatory planning processes. To address limitations in the supply of&#13;
technical and management expertise, assessments of capacity during preparation and&#13;
appraisal helped determine project scope, and led to a project design involving extensive&#13;
use of third party contracts (mostly NGOs). To address inexperience, detailed&#13;
documentation is providing guidance on project processes. The detailed specification of&#13;
organizational responsibilities, administrative structures, staffing plans, contracting&#13;
arrangements and ongoing planning and adjustment processes would help to ensure&#13;
adequate management support.&#13;

acceptability of investment costs, beneficiary contribution requirement, and&#13;
discretionary reserve) agreed with IDA ((para 2.16 and Annexes 8 and 18).&#13;
For each PA, SFDs would submit the first three proposals for village&#13;
ecodevelopment microplans (other than those approved during PPF) for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               37&#13;
approval by IDA prior to the implementation of the microplans (para.&#13;

(i)   submit to IDA for comment the preliminary annual work plan,&#13;
which would include undated project cost tables, training and&#13;
contracting plans, and other items agreed with IDA, by September&#13;
30, 1997 and on an annual basis thereafter (para. 4. 10)&#13;
(ii)  furnish to IDA final annual work plan proposals, taking into&#13;
account the comments of IDA, by January 30, 1998 and on an&#13;
annual basis thereafter (para 4.10)&#13;
(iii)  implement the final annual work plans (para. 4.10)&#13;
(iv)   submit to IDA progress reports, in a format acceptable to IDA, on&#13;
a semi-annual basis, by June 30 and December 31, beginning in&#13;
June, 1997 (para. 4.16), and&#13;
(v)   would prepare a mid-term review not later than June 30, 1999 in&#13;
accordance with guidance agreed with IDA, and would promptly&#13;
carry out the recommendations of this review (para 4.18).&#13;
(i)    Performance Monitoring Indicators. MOEF and GOSs would use&#13;
performance monitoring indicators agreed with IDA (para 4.16 and Annex&#13;
16)&#13;
(j)    No Involuntary Resettlement. In pursusing the objectives of the Project,&#13;
GOSs not carry out any involuntary resettlement for any people resident&#13;
within the PAs&#13;
(k)   Regional Impacts. GOI and GOSs would take steps acceptable to IDA to&#13;
ensure that activities outside the scope of the project would not undermine&#13;
effective biodiversity conservation within the project PAs, and would not&#13;
undermine the implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy in and&#13;
around the PAs. (para. 5.4 and Annex 7).&#13;
(1)    Guidelines for People in the PAs. Under the project (para 5.9 and Annex&#13;
20), GOSs would:&#13;
(i)    Ensure that any proposals for voluntary relocation would be&#13;
prepared and implemented in accordance with criteria agreed with&#13;
the IDA and after prior approval of IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               38&#13;
(ii)   For people who opt to remain in the PAs, prepare an indicative list&#13;
of appropriate village ecodevelopment investments acceptable to&#13;
IDA, which meets project criteria, and include these people in the&#13;
village ecodevelopment program&#13;
(iii)   Adopt an explicit strategy and plan for sustainable encroachment&#13;
control acceptable to IDA before making proposals for programs of&#13;
voluntary relocation&#13;

activities would not erode customary tenure rights over land and other&#13;
assets of tribals living in the project areas (para. 5.6).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
6 3   With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of&#13;
SDR 19.5 million (US$28 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 3 5 years&#13;
maturity and a GET grant of SDR 13.9 million (US$20 million equivalent).&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                39                            Annex 1&#13;
Annex 1: Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Legislation&#13;
in India&#13;
Background&#13;
I.    India is uniquely rich in biodiversity due to its diverse physiographic and climatic&#13;
conditions in the tropics and its location at the confluence of three major biogeographic&#13;
realms, the Indo-Malayan, the Eurasian, and the Afro-Tropical. It is a country of&#13;
megadiversity and has 10 biogeographic zones: Trans-Himalayan, Himalayan, Indian&#13;
Desert, Semi-arid, Western Ghats, Deccan Peninsula, Gangetic Plains, Northeast India,&#13;
Islands, and Coasts. The main strategy for conserving species has been through the&#13;
protection of viable representative habitats and ecosystems.&#13;
2.    Biodiversity conservation has an old history in India, being enshrined in the ancient&#13;
religions (Animism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism) and diverse cultures of the&#13;
subcontinent and in the mythology and traditional customs of indigenous peoples (such as&#13;
the "tree of life" in the Ramayana). In recent history the first codified legislation was the&#13;
Wild Birds Protection Act in 1887. It was followed by the Wildlife Birds and Animals Act&#13;
in 1912 (amended in 1935) and the Wildlife Protection Act 1927. After independence the&#13;
most significant enabling legislation on biodiversity conservation in India was the 42nd&#13;
amendment to the Indian Constitution, passed in 1976, making protection and&#13;
improvement of environment and safeguarding forests and wildlife one of the directive&#13;
principles of state policy. This legislation also brought wildlife and forest protection from&#13;
the state list into the concurrent list, enabling both the central and state governments to&#13;
pass protective legislation, that of the former superseding the latter.&#13;
3.    The most comprehensive act on biodiversity conservation since Independence was&#13;
the Wildlife (Protection) Act passed in 1972, affording varying degrees of protection to a&#13;
whole range of animal species under different schedules and enabling the setting up of&#13;
national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. This Act has been amended subsequently: in 1982&#13;
to allow capture and translocation, in 1986 to prevent trade in wild animals and animal&#13;
products, and in 1991 to afford protection to scheduled plants and to stop commercial&#13;
felling in wildlife sanctuaries. Other important legislation includes the Environment&#13;
(Protection) Act of 1986 to prevent, control, and mitigate environmental pollution and to&#13;
provide for coastal regulation zones, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)&#13;
Act of 1987. Another landmark in biodiversity conservation was the ratification of the&#13;
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1976.&#13;
4.    Apart from legislation, a number of policy statements have also guided&#13;
conservation efforts. The National Conservation Strategy (1992) and the Environment&#13;
Action Plan (1993) give priority to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The&#13;
conservation legislation, policies, and action plans are reflected in other related policy&#13;
statements: The Policy on Abatement of Pollution (1992), the National Housing Policy&#13;
(1988), the National Water Policy (1988), and the National Landuse Policy (1988).&#13;
5.    A draft bill for a "Conservation of Forests and Other Ecosystems Act" is currently&#13;
being debated. This bill is expected to curtail commercial felling in forest areas. There are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                40                             Annex 1&#13;
different interpretations of how the act would affect people's participation in management&#13;
and conservation of biodiversity. Some believe it would enhance official acknowledgment&#13;
of people's participation; others believe it would restrict local rights and increase&#13;
government control. A draft status report on biodiversity has been formulated through&#13;
nation-wide expert contributions; and a framework has been developed for a biodiversity&#13;
action plan. A biodiversity conservation act is also being drafted in the light of the&#13;
Biodiversity Convention.&#13;
Laws Governing Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
6.    There are more than 40 central government acts pertaining to various aspects of&#13;
biodiversity conservation. A much larger volume of state legislation pertaining to&#13;
biodiversity conservation is beyond the scope of this review. The Wildlife (Protection) Act&#13;
of 1972 supersedes all state legislation and the Indian Forest Act of 1927. It was amended&#13;
in 1982, 1986, and 1991 and is a unified national act that enables the constitution and&#13;
management of such areas as national parks, sanctuaries, game reserves, and closed areas;&#13;
it specifies the procedures for establishing protected areas, the management parameters for&#13;
them, and the procedures for allowing or disallowing diverse uses within them. The act&#13;
also lists the powers and functions of various officials. Under this act:&#13;
(a)   National parks are given a higher level of protection, with no grazing and&#13;
no private land holding or right permitted within them.&#13;
(b)    Sanctuaries are given a lesser level of protection, and certain activities may&#13;
be permitted within them for the better protection of wildlife or for any&#13;
other good and sufficient reason.&#13;
Human Interactions with Protected Areas&#13;
7.    Human interaction with wilderness areas is fundamental to human civilization, as&#13;
long as it does not disrupt ecological processes and the carrying capacity of ecosystems&#13;
within such areas. More than 50 percent of the protected areas have human populations&#13;
within and around them living under rights and leases that for the most part have not been&#13;
recorded. The Wildlife (Protection) Act provides for denotification of sanctuaries to allow&#13;
for certain human uses..&#13;
Protective Legal Coverage Of Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
8.    The range of species and varieties given legal protection under biodiversity&#13;
conservation is somewhat patchy, and domesticated varieties receive less coverage than&#13;
natural biodiversity (Table 1). The institutional structures for conserving biodiversity are&#13;
equally patchy. The legal and institutional coverage includes the following considerations&#13;
that are relevant to the Ecodevelopment Project:&#13;
(a)   Identification: The Botanical Survey of India (BSI), the Zoological Survey&#13;
of India (ZSI), state forest departments, universities, and several&#13;
independent institutions are actively engaged in the identification and&#13;
authentication of species and ecosystem types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                41                             Annex I&#13;
(b)   In-situ Protection: Species protection in situ is provided for in the Wild&#13;
Life (Protection) Act, and its 1991 amendments. Habitat (and ecosystem)&#13;
protection is directly provided for in the Indian Forest Act, 1927, the Wild&#13;
Life (Protection) Act of 1972, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the&#13;
Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other&#13;
Maritime Zones Act, 1976 and the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.&#13;
(c)   Ex-situ Protection: For rare, endangered and domesticated species living&#13;
outside natural habitats, in gardens, zoos, aquaria, and gene banks,&#13;
protection and perpetuation of biodiversity is especially important. The&#13;
Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, provides for the protection of some&#13;
animal species in captivity. There is no legal provision for the ex situ&#13;
protection of plant species.&#13;
(d)   Access and Extraction: Access to biodiversity and its extraction from&#13;
natural habitats enables it to be used for economic purposes and affects the&#13;
status of the habitat and ecosystem type. There are no central govemment&#13;
acts governing the access and property rights to animals and plants in their&#13;
natural habitats, except by through ownership of individual, communal or&#13;
government property. The Indian Forest Act, 1927, governs the extraction&#13;
of wild flora and fauna and the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, of&#13;
terrestrial biodiversity.&#13;
(e)    Use: The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and its amendment of 1991, and&#13;
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, regulate the use of some&#13;
animals and plants.&#13;
(f)    Trade: The barter, sale, import, export, or exchange of any species or its&#13;
derivatives affects the status of that species and its habitat. The Wild Life&#13;
(Protection) Act, 1972, the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 1914, the&#13;
Import and Export (Control) Act, 1947, The Customs Act, 1962, and the&#13;
Marine Products Export Development Authority Act, 1972, govern the&#13;
trade of selected wild animals and plants and their products.&#13;
(g)   Breeding, Cultivation and Multiplication: The breeding systems of species&#13;
determine the extent of their genetic variability and the dynamics of habitats&#13;
and ecosystems they utilize. Artificial or induced breeding techniques are&#13;
important for propagating captive populations. The Wild Life (Protection)&#13;
Act, 1972 and its 1991 amendments, govern the captive breeding of some&#13;
wild plants and animals.&#13;
(h)   Introduction, Augmentation and Reintroduction: There are no central&#13;
government acts on the introduction, augmentation, or reintroduction of&#13;
wild or domesticated animals or plants, except for specific legislation on&#13;
economic plant products, on some domesticated animals, and on the&#13;
accidental introduction of pests.&#13;
(i)    Release: There are no central government acts governing the accidental&#13;
release of wild or domesticated plants or animals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                42                             Annex I&#13;
(j)    Movement: The movement of specific wild or domesticated plants and&#13;
animals is govemed by central govemment acts controlling its trade.&#13;
(k)   Intellectual Property Rights: The are no central government acts&#13;
goveming the intellectual property rights of wild or domesticated plants&#13;
and animals.&#13;
9.    India has ratified a number of international treaties pertaining to the conservation&#13;
of biodiversitv.&#13;
10.   Coverage of protected areas is low in the Trans-Himalayan, North East Indian ,and&#13;
Gangetic Plain biogeographic zones (Table 2) where endemism is high and conservation is&#13;
critical.&#13;
11.   Among ecosystem types, forests (Table 3) appear better covered by conservation&#13;
measures than wetlands, coral reefs, or grasslands. Thus, this larger area of representative,&#13;
unique and fragile ecosystems, needs protection that is not only guaranteed but also&#13;
strengthened in relation to existing measures for conservation of biodiversity.&#13;
Status of Protected Areas&#13;
12.   PAs are under intense pressures from human populations living within them (&gt;55&#13;
percent of PAs) and around them (&lt;80 percent); from traditional rights and leases 40&#13;
percent), from traditional grazing by livestock (&gt;40 percent ), fodder extraction (&gt;15&#13;
percent), timber extraction (&gt;16 percent), and non-timber forest product (NTFP)&#13;
extraction (&gt;35 percent). In addition, a significant number of PAs are used by other&#13;
government agencies (&gt;55 percent ), for public thoroughfares (&gt;45 percent), and for&#13;
plantations (&gt;45 percent). Protected areas also experience illegal occupation and use (&gt;8&#13;
percent), encroachment (&gt;7 percent), and poaching (&gt;55 percent). In terms of PA&#13;
management, some have plans (&gt;30 percent) with zoning (&gt;20 percent; some have&#13;
populations that need relocation (&gt;5 percent); some have research and monitoring usually&#13;
by extemal persons (&gt;23 percent); some have exotic species introductions (&gt;15 percent);&#13;
and some captive breeding programs (15 percent). In terms of land use and environmental&#13;
effects, some PAs are affected by forest fires (&gt;20 percent), floods (&gt;35 percent),&#13;
droughts (50 percent), and/or water pollution (&gt;40 percent). Some have trained personnel&#13;
(&gt;35 percent) and honorary wardens (&gt;35 percent); but their association with NGOs&#13;
appears weak (&gt; 15 percent).&#13;
13.   India is party to several international conventions on biodiversity, so the protected&#13;
areas system is expected to conserve biodiversity not just for India but for the Earth as a&#13;
whole. That being so, this system clearly needs strengthening in a variety of ways&#13;
Future Directions&#13;
14.   The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
and the Ministry of Rural Development have joint responsibility for conserving wildlife&#13;
and biodiversity, and the first ministry has lead responsibility. The policy for biodiversity&#13;
conservation has been enunciated clearly in the National Conservation Strategy and Policy&#13;
Statement on Environment and Development (MOEF 1992), MOEF appears better&#13;
organized for wildlife conservation than for biodiversity conservation. The apparent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                43                             Annex I&#13;
reasons appear to be the broader scope of biodiversity conservation, the joint central and&#13;
state government responsibility for implementing biodiversity conservation in comparison&#13;
to the state responsibility for wildlife conservation, and the lack of a clearly defined&#13;
institutional network for implementing biodiversity conservation. As a consequence, the&#13;
wildlife institutions are implementing much of the terrestrial biodiversity conservation,&#13;
even though they have been poorly trained for this additional responsibility. Central and&#13;
state government strategies need to be developed for understanding, protecting, and using&#13;
biodiversity on a sustainable and equitable basis, especially to support India role as a party&#13;
to several international conventions on biodiversity.&#13;
15.   By definition, the current types of protected areas permitted in the Wildlife Act of&#13;
1 972---national parks and wildlife sanctuaries---restrict opportunities for local people to&#13;
derive benefits from PAs, and so present them with little incentive to participate in&#13;
conservation. India could benefit from an expanded protective network covering other&#13;
types of legally acceptable PAs. These might include protected landscapes, multiple&#13;
resource areas, etc., where mutually beneficial human-wildlife interactions can be&#13;
accommodated and promoted and multiple, site-specific objectives incorporated into&#13;
management plans. Several national NGOs are now advocating the concept of community&#13;
PA management, but this idea is controversial within government and some conservation&#13;
NGO circles.&#13;
16.   The M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, an environmental non-governmental&#13;
organization, has set out a list of policy actions and priority goals for biodiversity that&#13;
central and state governments need to consider:&#13;
(a)    Save prime habitats and endangered species&#13;
(b)   Conserve the entire range of species&#13;
(c)    Meet the minimum needs of the people in an ecologically sustainable way&#13;
(d)   Enhance conservation practices through education and awareness&#13;
(e)    Facilitate community activity for biodiversity conservation&#13;
(f)    Assess the implications of international conventions and agreements on&#13;
national sovereignty for saving and sharing biodiversity&#13;
(g)   Develop and strengthen effective enabling legislation for biodiversity&#13;
conservation&#13;
(h)    Strengthen and integrate administrative mechanisms at the community,&#13;
state, and national levels&#13;
(i)    Ensure that the biodiversity conservation movement is adequately&#13;
supported at central and state levels with financial, technical, and&#13;
institutional resources.&#13;
17.   As a sequel to Agenda 21, the Ministry of Environment and Forests is developing&#13;
the framework for a biodiversity action plan.&#13;
18.   Biodiversity conservation is under human pressure from the increasing scarcity of&#13;
land due to population growth. In addition, India's biodiversity is under severe threat from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                     44                                Annex 1&#13;
industry, especially subsidized forest-based industries . Already industrial interests are&#13;
trying to denotify established sanctuaries. Addressing the nine-point action plan of the&#13;
Swaminathan Foundation is an imperative. The Bank's ecodevelopment project for&#13;
protected areas, which provides for village ecodevelopment incentives while strengthening&#13;
PA management, is a step in the right direction towards building the kinds of alliances&#13;
both locally and nationally for biodiversity conservation.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                 47                                Annex 2&#13;
Annex 2: Current Organizational Structure and Capacity&#13;
General Management, Staffing, and Financial Support&#13;
I1.    The seven PAs have similar institutional arrangements for PA management, with a&#13;
conservator-level person in charge of the park. In some cases, like Kerala, this official's&#13;
major responsibility is the park, with other, smaller PAs also under his or her domain. In&#13;
cases like Karnataka, the conservator level-official's responsibility is much wider. In such&#13;
cases the next-level official, namely the deputy conservator of forests or the DFO, is in full&#13;
charge of the project PA. In all cases these officials are assisted by range officers, foresters&#13;
and forest guards&#13;
2.    In combination the seven PAs have a total of about 1800 field executive staff,&#13;
ranging from a low of 81 staff in Pench to a high of 458 in Gir. Annex 15, Table I&#13;
specifies the existing staffing levels for each PA. The PAs combined FY95/96 budgets&#13;
totaled US$4.2 million, ranging from a low of US$250,000 in Pench to US$1,320,000 in&#13;
Buxa. The "non-plan" budget for the project PAs, which is mainly for base wages,&#13;
generally represents about one half of total PA expenditures. These budgets represent a&#13;
significant portion of the total state budget for wildlife activities, reflecting the priority that&#13;
the states attach to the project PAs. Table I of this Annex presents the specific budgets&#13;
and financing for each PA. External project financing from IDA and GEF would be in&#13;
addition to existing levels of financial support for the project PAs and state wildlife&#13;
programs, which would be maintained during the project period. During the project&#13;
period, budgets for the MOEF ecodevelopment program in project PAs would be used to&#13;
cover a portion of the GOI counterpart budget requirements.&#13;
3.    The Project Tiger scheme, first introduced in 1973, has enhanced support for&#13;
management activities in the five PAs that are tiger reserves. In addition to centrally&#13;
sponsored financial assistance for PA management activities in these PAs, Project Tiger&#13;
provides. (a) 100 percent of central assistance for selected new staff including research&#13;
and veterinary staff (although the lack of career prospects have prevented tiger reserves&#13;
from attracting research staff); (b) 100 percemt of central assistance for special wage&#13;
supplements to staff at all levels; (c) 50 percent of central assistance for subsidizing crop&#13;
insurance premia of damage to property and life within 5 km of the tiger reserve&#13;
boundaries, and (d) 100 percent of assistance for grants for permanent disability of staff.&#13;
4.    Currently, the capacity of the Project Tiger Office is barely adequate to carry out&#13;
the Project Tiger program. The Project Tiger Office (PTO) is headed by a director,&#13;
supported by a deputy director, who are both seconded to the states for a four to five year&#13;
period. There are seven additional clerical staff, plus two peons. Although small in size the&#13;
PTO has enormous responsibilities for coordinating and supporting programs in India's 21&#13;
tiger reserves. PTO's responsibilities include the management of a centrally sponsored&#13;
scheme for supporting the development and maintenance of activities in the tiger reserves,&#13;
for providing secretariat support to a high-level Project Tiger Steering Committee, for&#13;
supporting MOEF ecodevelopment programs around the tiger reserves, for organizing&#13;
national and international meetings on tiger conservation, for supporting and coordinating&#13;
research, training, and census activities in the tiger reserves, for liaising with international&#13;
and national donor agencies and governments, and for responding to public and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

parliamentary queries about tiger conservation in India. The PTO has no prior experience&#13;
with the Bank's financial, procurement, and reporting procedures. Table 2 shows the&#13;
administrative budget of the Project Tiger Office.&#13;
Existing PA Management Programs&#13;
5.    Although management plans exist for all seven project PAs and cover an&#13;
implementation period of 5 to 10 years, most of these plans have expired or will need&#13;
updating in the next few years. The status of the plans by PA is:&#13;
(a)   Buxa          1993/94 to 1996/97&#13;
(b)   Gir           1976/77 to 1990/91&#13;
(c)    Nagarhole    1989 to 1994&#13;
(d)   Palamau       1987 to 1997&#13;
(e)    Pench        1990/91 to 1994/95&#13;
(f)    Periyar      1986/87 to 1995/96&#13;
(g)   Ranthambhore 1973/74 to 1983/84&#13;
6.    These plans are also not as comprehensive as they ought to be, and in particular&#13;
they do not take full cognizance of the linkages between PAs and local people who depend&#13;
on the resources contained within them. In addition, PA plans are not adequately&#13;
integrated into the broader ecological, socioeconomic, and regional sphere. PAs have&#13;
largely been managed as islands set aside from development.&#13;
7.    The project PAs are some of the more important PAs in the country and have&#13;
received more management and financial inputs than most others. However, there is still&#13;
considerable room for improvement.&#13;
8.    All of the PAs include legally designated sanctuaries and/or parks. Several also&#13;
include forest reserve areas that are managed as buffers. Four of the PAs are in the&#13;
process of upgrading sanctuaries to parks, a process that involves identifying and settling&#13;
the rights to meet the required prerequisite to final legal notification. Even those PAs that&#13;
have received final notification (Gir, Nagarhole, and Ranthambhore) face situations of&#13;
continued resource use and the possibility of legal challenges. All of the sites face the&#13;
limitations inherent in the Wildlife Act of 1972 which does not make legal provision for&#13;
multiple use areas within national parks.&#13;
9.    PAs have been managed as islands from surrounding areas. Forests in the PA&#13;
surroundings are under the jurisdiction of the territorial wings of the state forest&#13;
departments, which manage the areas for timber, bamboo and other NTFPs and generally&#13;
neglect the areas' supportive role in PA conservation. Coordination between PA&#13;
authorities and agencies working in vicinity of the PA are virtually non-existent. Often,&#13;
outside agencies implement activities that are detrimental to wildlife, for example., the&#13;
elimination of wildlife corridors that adjoin the PAs.&#13;
10.   Current PA management activities depend on availability of funds. They comprise:&#13;
(a) construction of water harvesting structures such as water holes, check dams, and other&#13;
small structures mainly for improving dry season availability of water for wildlife; (b)&#13;
limited programs for removal of noxious weeds and enrichment planting of these areas&#13;
with fodder and tree species; (c) construction of electric fencing and trenches to keep&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report              49                              Annex 2&#13;
animals from straying into surrounding villages, and to keep domestic animals from&#13;
entering the PAs; (d) quarters for staff, and (e) maintenance of firelines, boundary surveys,&#13;
and sign posting.&#13;
Existing Experience with Village Ecodevelopment and PA/Village Linkages&#13;
11.   There are a number of existing ecodevelopment programs. Small-scale&#13;
ecodevelopment programs include a centrally-sponsored MOEF scheme (with&#13;
expenditures of about US$1 million between FY93/94 and FY95/96, other schemes by&#13;
NGOs (for which specific estimates of total annual expenditures are not available, but are&#13;
only a small fraction of the MOEF scheme); preparation and training assistance&#13;
administered by the Wildlife Institute of India with funding from the United Nations&#13;
Development Program (US$1.3 million spread over several years); and the Forest&#13;
Research Education and Extension Project support for ecodevelopment programs in the&#13;
Great Himalayan Nation Park in Himachyl Pradesh and the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger&#13;
Reserve in Tamil Nadu (US$3.3 million spread over five years). All are rather limited in&#13;
scope and restricted to certain pockets. Evidence to date shows that the government&#13;
initiatives are generally employing traditional top-down approaches to project planning&#13;
and implementation, even when program documentation has embraced the principal of a&#13;
more participatory approach. The relation to reciprocal commitments and linkage to&#13;
conservation objectives has generally been implicit rather than explicit.&#13;
12.   Existing efforts confirm the need to develop stronger linkages between the&#13;
protected area and the local communities in order to implement effective ecodevelopment&#13;
programs. Currently some forest departments, such as Gujarat, already have used NGOs&#13;
to cultivate linkages with local communities, and other state forest departments are&#13;
planning to expand their use of NGOs. However at the moment this use of NGOs is not&#13;
generally structured and relies on informal arrangements rather than formal contracts.&#13;
13.   Experienced and professional NGOs already operate in at least four of the sites&#13;
including Nagarhole (MYRADA &amp; BAIF), Periyar (Peermade), Gir (AKRSP &amp; BAIF)&#13;
and Ranthambhore (WWF/India, Ranthambhore Foundation, &amp; CEE). MYRADA and&#13;
AKRSP are nationally recognized leaders in participatory rural development and in the use&#13;
of PRA methodologies. WWF/India is the leading conservation organization operating&#13;
throughout India; and BAIF is nationally recognized for its expertise in agroforestry,&#13;
horticulture, and land use. In addition there are local NGOs at these sites and Palamau,&#13;
with varying degrees of experience, competence, and interest. SPWD, IBRAD, and Action&#13;
Aid have played a national role in developing microplanning expertise for JFM, IIPA has&#13;
served as the national coordinator for the project preparation, and SPWD has served as an&#13;
advisor to project design.&#13;
14.   At the village level informal links with youth clubs, mahila sanghs (women's&#13;
associations) etc. form a part of the institutional arrangements for most ecodevelopment&#13;
efforts. In many cases, larger NGOs have encouraged these groups as part of overall&#13;
development efforts, without a specific focus on ecodevelopment. Forest departments&#13;
have begun to establish contact with these groups as part of the process of preparation for&#13;
this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 50                               Annex 2&#13;
15.   The extent to which forest department officials already have experience relevant to&#13;
the village ecodevelopment varies from state to state. For example, in West Bengal, the&#13;
success of the JFM activities has spurred many officers to start involving the communities.&#13;
Monitoring and Research&#13;
16.   Monitoring. Annual census surveys have been a part of the management of many&#13;
PAs in India, especially tiger reserves, for many years. Such surveys have almost entirely&#13;
focused on large mammals (herbivores and carnivores), and have used many methods such&#13;
as total count, block count, transect sampling, and pug marks. Such monitoring has been&#13;
the subject of several criticisms:&#13;
(a)   No coverage of the status of the habitat (which is relatively easy to&#13;
quantify)&#13;
(b)   The full range of biodiversity has not been covered, e.g. ecosystems,&#13;
smaller mammals, lower vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants&#13;
(c)    Methods such as total count and block count have no statistical base, hence&#13;
have low interpretability while making spatial and temporal comparisons&#13;
(d)    Statistically robust methods such as transect sampling often require large&#13;
samples that are beyond the resources and expertise available to&#13;
management&#13;
(e)    Tiger pug mark identification is highly arbitrary and requires a very high&#13;
level of subjectivity and expertise&#13;
(f)    Since the habitat conditions, disturbance factors, and management activities&#13;
have not been monitored, the results of monitoring of large mammals have&#13;
to be viewed in isolation&#13;
(g)   The increase in the large mammal population apparent from the annual&#13;
census is in contradiction with the general degradation of habitat evident in&#13;
many PAs&#13;
(h)   The absence of participation from others such as local people, NGOs,&#13;
scientists etc., although in recent years this has not been the case in some&#13;
PAs.&#13;
17.   The major drawback of these annual surveys is that there has been no conceptual&#13;
framework consisting of (a) clearly stated objectives for monitoring; (b) criteria for&#13;
evaluating the observed trends; (c) statistical model for the survey; (d) attributes of the&#13;
disturbance and PA management activities, and (e) mechanisms for feedback to PA&#13;
management.&#13;
18.   Research. In the past three decades a fair number of ecological studies and status&#13;
surveys have addressed conservation issues in protected and unprotected forested areas in&#13;
India. These studies have been conducted by a few institutions in India such as Wildlife&#13;
Institute of India (Dehra Dun), Centre for Ecological Sciences (Bangalore), Kerala Forest&#13;
Research Institute (Trissur), Bombay Natural History Society (Bombay), and recently the&#13;
Salim All Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (Coimbatore). The issues addressed&#13;
mostly relate to single species, often endangered large mammals and birds (e.g., elephant,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                51                                Annex 2&#13;
Asiatic wild ass, wild buffalo, Himalayan ibex, Asian lion, snow leopard, lion-tailed macaque,&#13;
Phayre's leaf monkey, lesser florican, etc). These studies have also mostly concentrated on&#13;
certain biogeographic zones in India, for example, western Ghats, north-west India, and&#13;
western Himalayas. Organisations such as some universities, Botanical Survey of India, and&#13;
Zoological Survey of India have carried out extensive inventories of flora and fauna. The above&#13;
studies have provided considerable insights into the ecology of individual species and their&#13;
conservation requirements, and provided some information on the distribution of flora and&#13;
fauna. Socioeconomic research has been scantier and has addressed issues such as local&#13;
resource needs and dependency on PAs, ethnobotany, local traditions and culture, and so forth.&#13;
These studies have been carried out by many organisations such as SPWD, WII, TISS,&#13;
Institute of Economic Growth, and so forth.&#13;
19.    Some management decisions and actions (mostly redefinition of existing PA&#13;
boundaries, creation of new PAs, and stringent policing) have flowed from such studies;&#13;
by and large, however, there has been no major improvement in the understanding of&#13;
issues relevant to PA management. As a result, research as it is now practiced, although of&#13;
considerable academic interest, is often viewed as only of marginal relevance to PA&#13;
management.&#13;
20.   There are several reasons for this state of affairs:&#13;
(a)    Research on biological, ecological, and socioeconomic issues has often&#13;
followed interests or perceptions of individuals and organizations, in&#13;
isolation from PA management and other interest groups or stake holders.&#13;
As a result, ecological and socioeconomic studies have often failed to&#13;
address information needs critical to PA management, even though such&#13;
needs have sometimes been articulated by the PA management and other&#13;
interest groups. It is also true that mechanisms for consultations to identify&#13;
information needs of PAs have not existed. For example, preparation of&#13;
management plans does not provide an opportunity for researchers to&#13;
contribute to them.&#13;
(b)   The fair body of information on biological, ecological and socioeconomic&#13;
issues relevant to PA management that have been generated over the last&#13;
many years has remained in the custody of numerous government and non-&#13;
governmental organizations and individuals. Much of this information has&#13;
not been verified for quality, is not published in a form accessible to PA&#13;
management, and has not been synthesized so as to meet the information&#13;
needs of PA management to the greatest extent possible.&#13;
(c)    The lack of adequately trained personnel and well staffed and equipped&#13;
institutions has been a major constraint in generating information that is&#13;
relevant to PA management. In such a large country as India, with a very&#13;
rich biodiversity, more than 500 PAs and large terrestrial and aquatic&#13;
habitats outside the PAs, the institutions and individuals with adequate&#13;
expertise and infrastructure for research have been very limited. Only a few&#13;
national institutions have been actively engaged in ecological and biological&#13;
research. Capacity to address socioeconomic research related to PA&#13;
management has been even more of a constraint. There has been no serious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                52                               Annex 2&#13;
effort to develop research interest and capabilities among institutions (such&#13;
as universities and NGOs) around or near the PAs that could meet the&#13;
information needs of the PA management on a sustained basis. National&#13;
institutes have been overburdened and, moreover, have had to shift their&#13;
focus topically and geographically in order to meet their mandate at a&#13;
national level.&#13;
(d)   Some PAs, especially riger teserves, have tried to conduct research by&#13;
appointing research officers. These attempts have mostly failed due to lack&#13;
of career opportunities for researchers in the forest departments, lack of&#13;
infrastructure, funding, and sustained commitment to research.&#13;
(e)   Finally, lack of adequate funds have constrained the extent of research that&#13;
could be carried out. Moreover with national institutions cornering most of&#13;
the research funds by virtue of their expertise, local institutions have been&#13;
starved of funds thus curtailing the development of expertise and research&#13;
interests in PAs adjacent to them.&#13;
21.   The emphasis on systematic information collection and use is minimal. The day-to-day&#13;
pressures of PA management are very high and there is little time and motivation and few&#13;
resources to collect, manage, use, and disseminate information. For the most part, use of&#13;
information is reactive. Field staff spend considerable time on non-productive administrative&#13;
reporting processes.&#13;
Environmental Education&#13;
22.   Awareness and education programs have usually been confined to the construction&#13;
of an interpretation center for visitors and to the preparation of a few posters or leaflets. A&#13;
few of the PAs show films on wildlife and organize nature camps. Staff conduct most of&#13;
these programs with little or no NGO participation. The PAs do not have an overall&#13;
strategy or plan that defines target groups, tools to be employed, types of materials&#13;
needed, institutional arrangements for implementation (including NGO roles), financial&#13;
costs, and so forth.&#13;
Coordination Arrangements in Recent Multistate Natural Resource&#13;
Management Projects&#13;
23.   The World Bank has financed many multi state projects in the past, including the&#13;
recently-closed National Social Forestry Project (NSFP) and Pilot Project for Watershed&#13;
Development in Rainfed Areas (PPWDRA), each of which covered four states. Two&#13;
continuing integrated watershed development projects (IWDPs) are also multistate&#13;
projects.&#13;
24.   In each case the nodal ministry of Government of India was responsible for&#13;
clarifying and communicating project concepts to participating states, reviewing progress&#13;
of project implementation through half-yearly reports and periodic visits to the states,&#13;
organizing the monitoring and evaluation of the project, and coordinating training&#13;
programs. Special cells or offices were established in the nodal ministry to enable it to&#13;
perform the assigned functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 53                               Annex 2&#13;
25.   In NSFP, the central support office (CSO) suffered from lack of proper identity.&#13;
and never had its own clearly designated full-time staff. It lacked adequate financial and&#13;
administrative powers, and was encumbered by a time-consuming clearance and decision&#13;
making-process. MOEF engaged seven regional institutions to carry out monitoring,&#13;
training, and studies on mutually agreed aspects of the project. The results of their&#13;
investigations were rarely fed into policy-making mechanisms of the states.&#13;
26.   A Watershed Development Council (WDC) staffed by twenty-three persons was&#13;
constituted in Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to perform similar functions in respect of&#13;
watershed development projects financed by the Bank. Periodic workshops were&#13;
organized by WDC for exchange of implementation experience by the participating states.&#13;
Besides coordinating and supervising Bank-assisted projects, the WDC supervises other&#13;
watershed development programs sponsored by MOA.&#13;
Panchayat Raj Act&#13;
27.   A panchayat is a municipal body. The recently introduced Panchayat Raj Act may&#13;
eventually affect the project's village-level institutional structures. Only a few states have&#13;
begun to implement this act (e.g. Kamataka, West Bengal).&#13;
28.   This act seeks to set in motion a decentralization process whereby the benefits of&#13;
development can reach people at the village level. While different states may have varying&#13;
structures, in general a three-tier system puts the zilla parishad/panchayat at the district-&#13;
level. Here elected representatives of the people and an administrative head chief executive&#13;
officer (CEO), who is an Indian Administrative Service officer handle matters at the&#13;
district level. A level below is the taluk panchayat, where elected representatives and&#13;
administrative officers are in charge of a few taluks, each consisting of approximately 30-&#13;
35 gram panchayats. A gram panchayat covers about 5000 population.&#13;
29.   Where a decentralized system is in place - West Bengal, for example -&#13;
implementation is quicker and people definitely participate more at the grassroots level. It&#13;
is important to note that planning, prioritization and implementation responsibilities shift&#13;
to the district level under the panchayat system.&#13;
30.   Village ecodevelopment committees would not necessarily correspond to the&#13;
panchayat structure, due to their smaller size and differences between administrative and&#13;
natural resource management boundaries. However, in some states they are likely to&#13;
include the local representative of the gram panchayat.&#13;

Annex 4: Notes on Project Preparation Process&#13;
1.    Preparation of the India Ecodevelopment Project, including indicative planning,&#13;
has been a country-driven and participatory process. These activities were carried out in&#13;
this way so that the project design and implementation would reflect the needs of affected&#13;
populations and the concerns of major stakeholder groups. The Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Forest (MOEF), in partnership with a national coordinating non-government&#13;
organization (NGO), the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), was responsible&#13;
for project preparation. The Indian government submitted the Indicative Plan to the Global&#13;
Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank for funding in June 1994. This part if the&#13;
exercise was financed using project preparation funds provided by the GEF and channeled&#13;
through UNDP.&#13;
2.    By that time, MOEF and IIPA had expanded involvement in preparation to the&#13;
following: seven government line agencies, ten state forest departments (SFDs)---the&#13;
eight proposed project SFDs plus the two SFDs implementing the Forestry Research&#13;
Education and Extension Project ecodevelopment components---and more than 40 NGOs.&#13;
3.    Project preparation took place in four stages; and stakeholder involvement&#13;
progressively increased at each stage. The four stages were as follows:&#13;
(a)   Defining project scope and selection criteria&#13;
(b)   Consulting with national, state, and local institutions&#13;
(c)   Performing participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) for indicative planning&#13;
(d)   Strengthening, and in some cases, establishing village groups and initiating&#13;
start-up activities.&#13;
Representative forestry NGOs and state and project officials undertook joint activities,&#13;
including at least 38 recorded meetings between March, 1992 and May, 1995 to discuss&#13;
project design and detailed work plans. The MOEF and IIPA also co-sponsored and&#13;
actively participated in 11 national and multisectoral consultation workshops, and 4&#13;
interstate and 14 state or project wide PRA training sessions.&#13;
Defining Project Scope and Selection Criteria&#13;
4.    Ecodevelopment has come to serve as a means for gaining local support for&#13;
conservation and for reducing impacts on biodiversity. This reflects lessons learned from&#13;
the Indian govemment's experiments with decentralized rural development programs and from&#13;
social forestry and joint forest management projects (JFM). For example, the policy paper&#13;
on ecodevelopment, issued by Project Tiger in 1991, consolidated findings on JFM&#13;
experiences as well as suggestions from previous papers (e.g., Eliciting Public Support for&#13;
Conservation in India, Indian Board for Wildlife, 1983; Wildlife and People, Wildlife&#13;
Institute of India, 1985). Background work also included numerous studies on the benefits&#13;
and failures of the panchayat (municipal govemment) system, including lessons on the&#13;
management of village based development assistance. Several workshops were also held in&#13;
1991 to incorporate these lessons into the developing ecodevelopment activities in and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

around national parks and reserves (e.g., Planning Commission workshop in Madras;&#13;
Wildlife Institute of India (WIT) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) seminar).&#13;
5.    The MOEF workshop in 1992, which involved representatives from protected&#13;
areas throughout the country and from key NGOs, set the stage for a multilevel&#13;
consultation process. MOEF later held a day-long meeting to discuss key issues in project&#13;
preparation, such as defining the project's objectives, limiting its scope, and developing&#13;
site selection criteria.&#13;
6.    As stated in the Preinvestment Action Brief submitted by MOEF and IIPA to the&#13;
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the agreed-upon selection criteria&#13;
included: (a) biogeographical representation; (b) degree of threat (mixture of problems&#13;
related to population pressures); (c) institutional framework (specifically, strength of&#13;
officials' interest in the project and presence of NGOs working in the area); (d) social&#13;
cohesiveness (presence of local groups); and (e) existence of people-oriented project&#13;
activities. Eventually, in interpreting these criteria, MOEF selected the proposed sites on&#13;
the basis of the importance of the site's biodiversity resources, regional representation, and&#13;
potential for success in implementing ecodevelopment activities. MOEF projected a&#13;
project site's chances of success on the basis of the nature and extent of human pressures&#13;
on biodiversity, protected areas (PA), ( management capacity and experience, existing&#13;
infrastructure (which accounted for the inclusion of six tiger reserves in the MOEF&#13;
proposal), accessibility, state and national government support, and state responsiveness&#13;
to community and NGO involvement. During the selection process, MOEF also decided to&#13;
include those sites highly motivated to implement ecodevelopment activities and with the&#13;
guaranteed capacity to do so.&#13;
7.    Preparation also included a survey of about 64 percent of all national parks,&#13;
reserves, and sanctuaries and a few site visits to establish a profile of potential project&#13;
sites. IIPA and two MOEF consultants evaluated findings from the survey and site visits&#13;
through a matrix analysis. They used this analysis to initially identify eleven potential sites&#13;
(Ranthambhore, Kalakaad, Pench, Periyar, Similipal, Buxa, Gir, Great Himalayan, Sariska,&#13;
Nagarhole, Palamau). MOEF subsequently selected Kalakaad and Great Himalayan for&#13;
support under the IDA financed Forestry Research Education and Extension Project.&#13;
Sariska was eliminated to avoid having more than one protected area per state.&#13;
8.    The 1994 government proposal was for eight sites, but in March, 1995, the Bank&#13;
reduced them to seven by excluding the Similipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa. This was&#13;
because Orissa did not provide the Bank with transparent, credible, and verifiable&#13;
assurances that all relocation after preappraisal would be consistent with the project&#13;
strategy for people in the PAs. (See Annex 20.)&#13;
Consulting with National and State Institutions&#13;
9.    IIPA served as the national coordinating NGO for project preparation but nine&#13;
other national NGOs actively participated in the conduct of special studies or through&#13;
participation in brainstorming meetings and national consultations (see List of NGOs).&#13;
MOEF and IIPA files have records of about 38 of these meetings and consultations(see&#13;
List of Consultations).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               65                             Annex 4&#13;
10.   In addition other national NGOs and multilateral funding agencies participated in&#13;
project design through three nationally organized consultation workshops. The objectives&#13;
of the first workshop, sponsored by MOEF's Project Tiger, were to define objectives for&#13;
ecodevelopment projects and to develop selection criteria. The objectives of the other two&#13;
national workshops, financed through GEF/UNDP preparation funds, were to discuss the&#13;
indicative planning process (workshop in October 1993) and to evaluate results of PRAs&#13;
conducted in the eight sites then proposed (workshop in February 1994).&#13;
II.  In April 1994, at a meeting of the project steering committee, UNDP and&#13;
GEF/World Bank representatives, IIPA and other NGOs reviewed proposed project&#13;
activities in the Indicative Plan. MOEF, state, and NGO representatives held four further&#13;
meetings to respond to comments on this plan and to develop more detailed financial and&#13;
administrative procedures.&#13;
12.   More than 30 environmental NGOs attended a workshop in September 1994,&#13;
organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India). This workshop&#13;
endorsed ecodevelopment as a viable approach to human and environmental issues and&#13;
stressed the importance of sustaining NGO involvement in project decision making.&#13;
13.   At the local level, several village meetings and group consultations were held but&#13;
mostly remained undocumented.&#13;
Performing Participatory Rural Appraisals&#13;
14.   As part of site selection, IIPA conducted reconnaissance visits to seven sites, using&#13;
rapid assessment techniques, such as checklists and key informant interviews. After the&#13;
sites were identified, participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) were then conducted in local&#13;
communities. These were used to establish baseline profiles of affected populations and to&#13;
assess the capacity of local institutions to implement ecodevelopment activities.&#13;
15.   State or park officials---usually the assistant conservator of forest (ACF) or the range&#13;
officer---and a local NGO conducted several joint PRAs in sample villages for each project&#13;
site. To ensure consistency of data collection and to allow many respondents to&#13;
participate, IIPA and the Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development (SPWD)&#13;
conducted two training exercises on PRAs in February and July 1993. These focused on&#13;
mobilizing villagers and encouraging their participation. Several local PRA training sessions&#13;
were also held for project staff and local NGOs assigned to do data gathering using PRAs.&#13;
Concurrently WII, with financing from UNDP/FAO, organized a six week training&#13;
program in ecodevelopment planning where officers from selected PAs, including some&#13;
from this project, were trained.&#13;
16.   However, not all sites completed PRAs as scheduled sometimes because&#13;
participation was limited by the skills, training, and orientation of the PRA teams. Some&#13;
PAs had to expand PRAs to villages not covered in the first round (such as villages inside&#13;
protected area boundaries). In many cases, additional information was required.&#13;
Therefore, NGOs made a second set of PRAs to augment data earlier generated by project&#13;
officers and consultants.&#13;
17.   IIPA also collected baseline information from secondary sources across all sites to&#13;
supplement the PRA findings. This secondary data included the number, distribution, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

composition of people in and around the PAs, socioeconomic parameters, and social&#13;
organizations and culture. IIPA was in charge of consolidating PRA findings and&#13;
secondary source data and presenting a set of proposed activities. Government and NGO&#13;
representatives provided feedback on these findings through technical reviews national&#13;
consultation, and project planning workshops. PRA results have yet to be formally presented&#13;
to local communities at organized village meetings, but some project sites have discussed&#13;
possible project activities and key issues, and a few of these meetings are documented (see&#13;
List of Consultations, below). Village ecodevelopment committees will be set up under the&#13;
project to sustain the participation of local people in the microplanning for ecodevelopment and&#13;
in the monitoring of project activities.&#13;
Update on Preparation&#13;
18.   Role of Indicative Plan. The indicative planning during project preparation&#13;
reflected only a sample of views; it was never intended to be comprehensive in scope, nor&#13;
to incorporate the views of all potential project participants. During project preparation it&#13;
helped to identify (a) the nature of typical village ecodevelopment investments and other&#13;
project investments and the participatory planning processes to be used to identify&#13;
reciprocal commitments and investments (Annex 8), and (b) preliminary background&#13;
information and social assessment findings (Annexes 6 and 20). During the Bank&#13;
preappraisal and appraisal missions, many improvements to the explicit criteria and the&#13;
planning processes were incorporated into the project design. The project also&#13;
incorporated new activities (e.g., incorporating PA concerns into regional activities) that&#13;
were not originally included, and expanded others (e.g., ecosystem management and&#13;
protection, impact monitoring and research) beyond levels envisaged in the original&#13;
proposal. The indicative plans have never been regarded as approved microplans,&#13;
approved PA management plans or other approved investment proposals. The project&#13;
design is not a blue print of tangible investments; rather it is a set of agreed processes and&#13;
criteria that would be used for the project duration. The project even includes provisions&#13;
to improve the processes and criteria during implementation, in response to experience.&#13;
19.   Gaps in Consultation. After the original project preparation efforts that finished&#13;
in early 1994, until the negotiations in July 1996, not all PA managers have regularly&#13;
communicated with local people and NGOs about the project. The Bank provided a PPF&#13;
Advance in early 1995, in part to facilitate such communication, but PPF expenditures did&#13;
not begin until 1996. In some PAs, gaps in consultation have contributed to&#13;
misunderstandings. The resulting problems have highlighted the importance of&#13;
government managers, NGOs, local people, and others making special efforts to build&#13;
effective, sustainable, communication channels.&#13;

(3)   Examples of Other Consultations&#13;
Village meetings-were held in all PAs where the majority of villages within the project&#13;
boundaries were represented; average number of people attending village meetings was about 20,&#13;
with a balanced mix of men and women; most of the meetings were presided over by project&#13;
officials, but other meetings were also facilitated by trained community officers from local NGOs&#13;
or IIPA. Topics in these meetings covered information dissemination about the proposed project&#13;
(e.g., description of possible activities, objectives); needs and problems of local residents; feedback&#13;
on proposed activities. Attendance in the meetings was high and the format allowed participation of&#13;
most community members. There were occasions when separate meetings with women's groups&#13;
were held to enable them to voice their opinions freely.&#13;
Small group meetings were useful in the conduct of PRAs. These meetings were held in&#13;
groups of six to ten people and, in some cases, in focus groups, such as groups of women, tribals,&#13;
or livelihood groups. Social mapping and illustrations were often done through small group&#13;
meetings.&#13;
PRA exercises-not only provided useful baseline information but were valuable in&#13;
encouraging local people to participate in project planning and design. Six projects have on file&#13;
the results of detailed social mapping, which were later used in the identification of key&#13;
problem areas. Synchronized calendars provided information on planting and collection&#13;
schedules that were used in determining the timing of credit and input procurements. Other&#13;
useful information, PRA consultation, and data gathering tools included group construction of&#13;
matrices on non-timber forest products, value and species of trees, and problem-solution&#13;
diagrams. Some PRAs applied transects to depict geographic variations across the site. The&#13;
extent of PRAs in each site is described in the table below.&#13;

Indicative List of Possible Village Investments.&#13;
On the basis of PRA surveys in sample communities in and around the PAs, the&#13;
project preparation teams have identified an indicative list of possible ecodevelopment&#13;
investments. These investment ideas will require additional site-specific review to judge&#13;
whether they meet the above criteria. Not all investments would necessarily be adopted,&#13;
others may be identified during more detailed planning. The activities can be grouped as&#13;

Annex 5: Rationale for GEF Funding and Analysis of&#13;
Incremental Costs of Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
1.    Consistency with Biodiversity Convention. The project would fully conform to&#13;
the Convention on Biological Diversity and guidance from the Conference of the Parties.&#13;
The Indian government has identified ecodevelopment as a national priority in the&#13;
biodiversity action plans and policy statements. Consistent with the convention, project&#13;
activities would:&#13;
(a)    Strengthen conservation, management, and sustainable use of eocsystems and&#13;
habitats in environmentally vulnerable areas including semiarid and mountain&#13;
regions&#13;
(b)   Conserve biodiversity and its sustainable use through innovative measures&#13;
including economic incentives and compensation to local communities for&#13;
opportunity costs&#13;
(c)    Strengthen local and indigenous people's involvement in conservation policies&#13;
by integrating social dimensions, with particular regard to poverty&#13;
(d)   Promote conservation and sustainable use of endemic species&#13;
(e)    Serve as demonstration projects and encourage scientific excellence.&#13;
2.    GEF Operational Strategy. The project would also be consistent with the GEF&#13;
operational strategy. It would:&#13;
(a)   Meet incremental costs to achieve agreed global benefits (see analysis below)&#13;
and ensure cost-effectiveness&#13;
(b)   Be country-driven and based on national priorities&#13;
(c)   Provide full disclosure, and provide for stakeholder consultation and&#13;
participation&#13;
(d)   Leverage financing from other sources&#13;
(e)   Be monitored and evaluated&#13;
(f)    Support long-term protection and sustainable use of biodiversity in forest,&#13;
semiarid, and mountain ecosystems.&#13;
3.    Global Significance. The project meets GEF criteria by addressing urgent global&#13;
biodiversity conservation needs. The project would conserve biodiversity in seven critical&#13;
areas, in this megadiversity country. One of the seven protected areas, Gir, has the&#13;
world's only population of Asian lions. The other six project sites support vital&#13;
populations of tigers, among the world's most endangered carnivores, as well as other rare&#13;
and endangered flora and fauna. Five sites are included in the intemationally recognized&#13;
Project Tiger program, which uses the tiger as a symbol of national heritage in order to&#13;
protect a wide range of ecosystems and the other species that depend on them. Reviews&#13;
and programs sponsored by United Nations agencies have given official recognition to five&#13;
of the sites, including both of the sites that are not part of Project Tiger. In combination,&#13;
these sites give good biogeographic and habitat coverage (e.g., dry deciduous open&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 76                               Annex S&#13;
forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous open forests, and wet evergreen forests).&#13;
The project would conserve ecosystems in danger of fragmentation and degradation. The&#13;
level of threats to biodiversity in the seven sites is high and requires a substantial effort on&#13;
an urgent basis. The project, combined with the country's demonstrated commitment to&#13;
conservation, should help to counteract these threats on a sustainable basis. The project,&#13;
with IDA financing, would also help the Indian government to prepare future projects&#13;
addressing other critical biodiversity issues.&#13;
4.    Overview of Incremental Cost Analysis. The analysis of "incremental costs" in&#13;
accordance with GEF guidelines shows baseline costs of US$19 million, which would be&#13;
financed locally and incremental costs of US$48 million, which would be financed by GEF&#13;
and IDA. The Government of India realizes that, in view of the scale of external funding&#13;
required, it cannot expect to receive a GEF grant sufficient to cover the entire incremental&#13;
cost of the global alternative. However, it is so strongly committed to the objectives of the&#13;
project that it is willing to borrow up to US$28 million of IDA resources to cover 58&#13;
percent of the incremental cost. A GEF grant of US$20 million would cover the remaining&#13;
42 percent of the incremental cost.&#13;
5.    Baseline Scenario. Under the baseline scenario (i.e., without the global project),&#13;
state and national governments would continue to provide the current level of funding for&#13;
traditional PA management. This level of funding compares extremely well with that of&#13;
other developing countries. During FY 95/96 this funding was US$4.2 million for the&#13;
seven project sites (see Annex 2); continuing this level would imply an expenditure of&#13;
US$21.0 million during the five year project period. However, it is assumed that much of&#13;
this funding is not directly related to the project focus and therefore only US$10 rnillion of&#13;
this sum is included in the baseline scenario (for breakdown see table below). In addition,&#13;
the national government would provide over US$2 million for additional village&#13;
ecodevelopment funds flowing to individual communities, on top of the US$1 million&#13;
currently provided through the existing MOEF program. The baseline also includes US$2&#13;
million in increased operation and maintenance, because these expenditures would provide&#13;
national as well as global benefits. Local people would contribute US$5 million. The total&#13;
cost of the projected baseline activities is therefore estimated at US $ 19 million. Both the&#13;
national and state governments recognize the importance of the ecodevelopment&#13;
approach, but widespread poverty is causing many competing demands for scarce public&#13;
funds.&#13;

6 .    Under the baseline scenario, the negative environmental impacts of local people on&#13;
biodiversity, and the negative trends in the richness, complexity, diversity, connectivity,&#13;
and regeneration of ecosystems and species would continue to accelerate. The baseline&#13;
scenario would not include resources for contracting NGOs, for intensive staff training, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                77                              Annex 5&#13;
or for supervisory travel. The increase in ecodevelopment funds, while significant, would&#13;
still be insuffient. The baseline financing would not provide the critical mass of financing&#13;
that is required to address the increasing pressures on the project PAs. The extent and rate&#13;
of degradation among the project PAs would vary, but in all cases it would cause&#13;
significant losses in global biodiversity. It is likely that some of the most vulnerable PAs&#13;
(e.g., Ranthambhore) would lose much of their valuable biodiversity within the next 20&#13;
years.&#13;
7.    Global Alternative. With GEF and IDA financing, the national and state&#13;
government would be able to undertake a much more ambitious protection/buffer zone&#13;
development program in and around the seven PAs.This larger scale of funding is needed&#13;
to address urgent threats to biodiversity, to ensure coverage of globally significant sites, to&#13;
test the ecodevelopment concept in a representative range of climatic, habitat and&#13;
socioeconomic environments, to develop alternative livelihoods, and to develop a&#13;
framework for expanded future support. The conservation agenda is burgeoning. GEF&#13;
would meet a significant portion of the gap between increasing conservation requirements&#13;
and limited budget resources. One of the most important requirements is the application of&#13;
the new, initially more costly, participatory approaches (including the negotiation and&#13;
implementation of reciprocal commitments between local people and PA authorities) that&#13;
address the increasing pressures on PAs. The global alternative would slow, halt, or&#13;
possibly even reverse negative environmental impacts and ecological trends. It would&#13;
offset negative economic and cultural impacts of PAs on local communities (an&#13;
opportunity cost of global conservation which is rarely acknowledged and compensated),&#13;
and empower communities to meet their needs in an environmentally sustainable manner.&#13;
It would provide a firmer base of public support for the PAs, and increase the&#13;
understanding of PA biodiversity, local people, and their interactions. In addition to&#13;
conserving globally significant biodiversity in the seven PAs, the global alternative would&#13;
also develop capacity for increased conservation in the future through preparation of&#13;
future projects, financed by IDA. The benefits of the global alternative correspond in&#13;
general to the project benefits. For more detailed analysis of benefits, see Annex 21.&#13;
8.    No Net National Benefits From Additional Initiatives. There would be no net&#13;
national benefits from these additional initiatives. The village ecodevelopment program&#13;
will substitute roughly equal quantities of sustainable, conservation-compatible incomes&#13;
for resources for incomes and resources that are currently adversely affecting biodiversity.&#13;
National benefits associated with other components are covered in the baseline case.&#13;

9.    Incremental Costs. The costs of the Baseline Scenario and the GEF Alternative&#13;
are presented below, by major project component (in US$ min):&#13;

The comparison of baseline scenario costs (US$19 million) with the costs of the GEF&#13;
alternative (US$67 million) results in an incremental cost of about&#13;
US$48 million to achieve global benefits. The GEF grant of US$20 million would&#13;
contribute substantially to financing these incremental costs.&#13;
10.   Use of Project Funds and Additionality. In the context of scarce public&#13;
resources, tight budgets, and competing demands, it is important that all project funds be&#13;
used in accordance with the project design for the agreed project objectives and that&#13;
financing be provided as an additionality. The project includes contracted consultants who&#13;
would review the project expenditures and procurement (for terms of reference, see&#13;
Annex 11). To provide information related to additionality the progress reporting would&#13;
include data on biodiversity conservation expenditures (see Annex 16).&#13;

Buxa Tiger Reserve&#13;
Locafton&#13;
1.    Buxa Tiger Reserve is situated in northern West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district, on the&#13;
border with Bhutan and the state of Assam. It covers an area of 761 sq. km, with a core zone&#13;
of 314.5 sq. km designated as sanctuary (117 sq. km proposed the national park), and the&#13;
remaining 391 sq. km categorized as forest reserve.&#13;
2.    The Protected Area includes two distinct types of topography: the southern plains,&#13;
at an elevation of 150 m, and the northem hills, with elevations up to 1750 m. Several&#13;
seasonal and perennial rivers, the largest being the Sankosh River, drain the hills. The&#13;
annual rainfall is about 400 cm, mostly from the southwest monsoon; annual temperatures&#13;
range from -10° to 40°C.&#13;
3.    Buxa's combination of habitats - semi-evergreen and subtropical hill forest with&#13;
tropical moist forest and wetland - shelters a particularly wide and unusual variety of&#13;
wildlife. Human occupation of the Gangetic Plains has been intensive for so long that&#13;
representative natural areas are few. The Central and Eastern Himalaya, on the other hand,&#13;
are a treasure trove of diversity, and a great many floral and faunal elements from the&#13;
Eastem Himalaya spill into Buxa.&#13;
People&#13;
4.    According to the 1991 census, 15,608 people inhabit "forest villages" and fixed&#13;
demand holdings within the Protected Area. The indigenous population includes Bengalis,&#13;
Nepalese and members of Scheduled Tribes (primarily Rava, Bhutia, Bodo, Garu and&#13;
Santal) and the Scheduled Rajbanshi Caste. The British established forest villages at the&#13;
tum of the century, settlers received up to 0.2 ha of homestead land and permanent&#13;
cultivation areas up to 0.4 ha in hill areas, or 0.8 ha in the plains. Bangladeshi immigrants,&#13;
among more recent arrivals, reside on the outskirts of the PA.&#13;
5.    At present there are 37 forest villages inside reserve boundaries, and eight within&#13;
the park. Forest villagers derive their income from sources including employment in Forest&#13;
Department operations (decreasing due to restrictions resulting from the establishment of&#13;
the PA); intercropping or 'taungya' in plantation areas; collection of NTFP for non-&#13;
resident permit holders (see Table 3) and other NTFP for themselves, for which no&#13;
royalties are charged; and traditional agriculture.&#13;
6.    Forest Department operations account for five fixed-demand holdings within&#13;
reserve boundaries. For a number of years, the practice of renewing annual fixed demand&#13;
licenses has lapsed, due to concem that leasing of forest areas for non-forest purposes&#13;
would contravene provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; technically, these&#13;
settlements could be considered illegal.&#13;
7.    Forty-four revenue villages, with a population of 84,648 (1991 census), surround&#13;
the project area. Scheduled Tribes form 44% of this population; 36% belong to Scheduled&#13;
Castes. PA authorities have targeted a population of 36,000 for the ecodevelopment&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  84                                Annex 6&#13;
8.    Urban settlements within 5 km of the reserve include Alipurduar (pop. 26,000), as&#13;
well as a few large villages. 25 tea estates adjoining the reserve add a population of&#13;
125,601 of which over half belong to Scheduled Tribes.&#13;
9.     Agriculture is the principal activity in the revenue villages adjoining the PA, with&#13;
rain-fed paddy rice, jute and tea as the main crops. Land is primarily under private&#13;
ownership (raiyat), but some wasteland is held by the Government as vested land. Tea&#13;
garden lands are allocated on a long-term basis by the Land Revenue Department. About&#13;
20% of rural households are landless or sharecroppers. There are 279 recognized&#13;
firewood dealers, 26 sawmills, 45 cane processing units and four veneer units in close&#13;
proximity of the reserve.&#13;
10.   Approximately 29,000 people visited Buxa Tiger Reserve during 1992-1993.&#13;
Three-quarters come for riverside picnics around Jainti, others visit two holy caves within&#13;
the project area, and a small number venture further inside the reserve in order to trek at&#13;
higher elevations. At present there is little opportunity for local residents to participate in&#13;
tourism activities, since operations are controlled by the Forest Department.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
11.   Nearly 120 sq. km. of lowland moist forest and large areas of the hill forests are still&#13;
relatively undisturbed. These forests contain the best remnants of the rich biodiversity in this&#13;
area. Nine distinct forest types have been identified within PA borders, and 1,000 species of&#13;
plants, including ferns.&#13;
12.   The clouded leopard, goral,-Malayan giant squirreL parti-colored flying squirrel, hoary-&#13;
bellied squirrel, Himalayan palm civet and yellow-throated marten represent larger Central and&#13;
East Himalayan mammals. Characteristic animals of the Gangetic plains, now rare, include&#13;
tiger, leopard, elephants, sambar, chital, and otter. Two species historically reported, the wild&#13;
buffalo and the Great Indian rhinoceros, are no longer found at Buxa but occur in adjoining&#13;
PAs.&#13;
13.   This PA is too small in area to sustain populations of large mammals over time. With&#13;
Jaldapara situated to the west, Butan to the north, and Assam to the east, efforts to maintain&#13;
and improve wildlife access to other protected areas will be vital to the long-term survival of&#13;
big animals such as elephants.&#13;
14.   Birdlife includes the Bengal florican and black-necked crane (only a few sightings),&#13;
along with a full compliment of Himalayan birds- the 185 reported species are likely to be only&#13;
a sample. A great variety of smaller mammals, lower vertebrates (fishes, amphibians and&#13;
reptiles), invertebrates, such as butterflies and moths, and plant forms such as orchids remain to&#13;
be studied.&#13;
Blodiversity Pressures&#13;
15.   Settlements within and adjoining the reserve put great strain on natural resources.&#13;
(Peculiar to this site is the inability of PA authorities to deal directly with tea estates, as&#13;
they are considered an organized industry beyond the mandate of the Forest Department.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                85                               Annex 6&#13;
16.   Compounded by timber and fuelwood collection (for day-to-day needs and for selling&#13;
to tea estates), crop cultivation disturbs and degrades habitat. Feeding 105,000 head of cattle&#13;
on PA vegetation furthers degradation and invasion by weeds. Crop depredation by elephants&#13;
and other ungulates causes conflict between local people and forest managers. Ivory poaching&#13;
has recently become a major threat to the elephants.&#13;
17.   Local people collect a wide variety of non-timber forest products - bamboo, cane,&#13;
fruits, seeds, simul floss, Dioscoria tubers, edible and decorative mushrooms, resins - with&#13;
little regard for future supplies.&#13;
18.   Seventy-three fixed-demand licensees and 181 other individuals (including&#13;
residents of forest villages) have encroached onto Reserve forest lands to establish 300 ha&#13;
of orange orchards.&#13;
19-   Forestry operations have had significant impact on native biodiversity with large areas&#13;
being logged, primarily for sal-wood railway sleepers, and about 28% of the area planted with&#13;
teak. Mining dolomite from a 12-ha site within the PA is causing major disturbance, siltation&#13;
and pollution.&#13;
20.   Flooding occurs and rivers change course every year, damaging large areas and often&#13;
destroying critical habitats.&#13;
Social Considerations&#13;
21.   Since 1991 PA authorities have been using Project Tiger funding for&#13;
ecodevelopment activities that include crop protection measures, land improvement,&#13;
fuelwood plantations, energy conservation efforts and education programs. Sixteen&#13;
Ecodevelopment Committees have been established in the project area, which also comes&#13;
under a JFM Government Order. Villagers and the Forest Department jointly operate&#13;
several Forest Protection Committees.&#13;
22.   Authorities plan to relocate a number of forest villages, with their consent, during&#13;
the course of the project period. Currently, officials are discussing relocation of one forest&#13;
village from the reserve. The terms of agreement include provisions for each household to&#13;
receive one hectare of irrigated land plus housing outside the reserve plus access to forest&#13;
land, while remaining outside the panchayat system for the time being. PA authorities plan&#13;
to raise fodder/fruit plantations on the vacated land. Two other forest villages are in more&#13;
preliminary stages of discussing relocation.&#13;
23.   The nature of planned ecodevelopment activities raises a number of key social&#13;
issues which need to be addressed prior to implementation. The effectiveness of the&#13;
microplanning process will clearly be hindered by the absence of NGOs in the area.&#13;
Relocation plans for settlements currently within the PA require further elaboration,&#13;
particularly for those settlements at higher elevations, and for fixed demand holdings&#13;
where the security of tenure is unclear. As employment opportunities with the Forest&#13;
Department decrease, the feasibility and appropriateness of alternative income generation&#13;
strategies, especially for the landless, tribals and women, will require considerable&#13;
attention.&#13;

Gir National Park&#13;
Location&#13;
24.   Gir National Park is located in the Kathiawar Peninsula in Saurashtra, Gujarat. The PA&#13;
covers 1,412 sq. km. of which 258 sq. km is National Park and the remaining area is sanctuary.&#13;
25.   The rugged, hilly terrain ranges in altitude from 152 m to 528 m. Most of the 100-cm&#13;
mean annual rainfall comes from the southwest monsoon, temperatures range from 100 to 440&#13;
C. There are seven perennial rivers, four man-made irrigation tanks, and 18 year-round tanks.&#13;
26.   Though the entire park is considered semi-arid, a sharp decrease in rainfall from west&#13;
to east is reflected in the vegetation, with very dry teak forest in the west giving way to dry&#13;
deciduous scrub and dry savanna forest in the east. Significantly different vegetation grows in&#13;
narrow bands along the rivers. A limited area was planted with teak in 1961-62. About 400&#13;
species of flowering plants have been reported.&#13;
People&#13;
27.   Over 70,000 people lived in the intended project area as of the 1981 census. In&#13;
1981, 1,491 (1%) were Scheduled Tribes and 7,486 (6%) were Scheduled Castes. PA&#13;
authorities have identified a population of 72,000 within a 2-km radius of park boundaries,&#13;
in 97 revenue villages, to participate in ecodevelopment. Within the park itself are 54&#13;
pastoral settlements or 'nesses' inhabited by 2,540 Maldharis; 14 forest villages, with a&#13;
population of 4,500 residents including 239 Siddis, a Scheduled Tribe of African origin;&#13;
and three temple complexes occupied by 65 people.&#13;
28.   Neighboring villagers mostly grow groundnuts, cotton, sorghum and sugarcane&#13;
and raise livestock. Especially during the monsoon, grazing territory lies primarily within&#13;
the PA.&#13;
29.   Maldharis, with settlement and grazing rights in the park, raise livestock and sell&#13;
milk products (usually clarified butter and milk for those with access to markets). Between&#13;
1972 and 1986, 580 Maldhari families were resettled from the area currently defined as&#13;
national park to new locations, with land for cultivation, on the periphery of the PA. Some&#13;
have continued in livestock production, while others have taken up wage labor.&#13;
30.   The temple complexes of Kankai, Banej and Tulsishyam occupy 3,522 ha of land&#13;
in the protected area, some of which is given over to cultivation, and 20 ha of which is&#13;
leased from the Forest Department. Though the park is closed to tourists during the&#13;
monsoons, pilgrims tend to visit throughout the year. 1992-93 saw some 80,000 pilgrims,&#13;
mainly from Gujarat, accommodated in a variety of temple-owned, private and state-&#13;
government facilities.&#13;
31.   In 1992-93, 45,000 tourists came to see the animals. The Forest Department&#13;
operates a guesthouse in Sasan, and an Interpretative Park for tourists in Devalia. Locals&#13;
benefit from tourism by operating several small lodges in Sasan and are employed as&#13;
guides.&#13;

Biodiversity Values&#13;
32.   In the 64,000 sq. km of the Saurashtra peninsula, Gir remains the only patch of natural&#13;
forest. Its unique importance is as the only home for the last surviving Asian lions in the wild,&#13;
currently thought to have recovered from fewer than 50 to an estimated population of 284. .&#13;
33.   The highly productive grass-and-shrub landscape supports large numbers of grazing&#13;
animals including four-homed antelope and Indian gazelle as well as chital, sambar and nilgai.&#13;
Large carnivores include leopards and striped hyena as well as lions; noteworthy smaller&#13;
mammals include the rusty spotted cat.&#13;
34.   Also notable are the lesser florican and a rich assortment of birds of prey (especially&#13;
during migration) and substantial populations of marsh crocodile and starred tortoise. Smaller&#13;
mammals, lower vertebrates and invertebrates have not been studied.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
35.   In the past, Gir NP has experienced considerable trouble from timber smuggling&#13;
and animal poaching. With the active cooperation of local people, much of this illicit&#13;
activity has been successfully controlled. The cumulative effect of human activities such as&#13;
logging, plantations, fire and grazing has resulted, however, in the dominance of thomy and&#13;
fire-hardy plant species and an abundance of weeds. Moreover, the total conversion of&#13;
surrounding land to intensive agriculture has isolated the ecosystem.&#13;
36.   Continuing issues concern the impact of local demand for grazing and fuelwood;&#13;
crop loss caused by wild animals; loss of livestock, and human lives, to lions.&#13;
37.   Residents of 54 Maldhari settlements and 14 forest villages within the park and&#13;
villagers from around the protected area maintain 100,000 head of cattle on (Gir's vegetation.&#13;
Human settlement and the intense grazing pressure have severely impacted biodiversity, though&#13;
the ungulate population rebounded when some of the grazier community resettled outside the&#13;
PA.&#13;
38.   Traffic: four public roads that pass through the PA are heavily used by pilgrims,&#13;
tourists and the local populace; three temple complexes are located on disputed lands inside the&#13;
PA; the number of tourists is increasing; and a railway line passes through the PA. Increased&#13;
human traffic increases the chance of fire.&#13;
39.   The singularity of the Asiatic lion population leaves it extremely vulnerable to local&#13;
catastrophe, such as drought and disease. This isolation is relatively recent, since lions were&#13;
recorded in adjoining states even early this century. There are plans to translocate lions from&#13;
Gir, to create a second population.&#13;
Social Considerations&#13;
40.   The Maldharis have a long and close association with the fauna and flora of Gir.&#13;
While many have moved away from their traditional grazing areas and some from their&#13;
traditional livelihoods, their indigenous knowledge of the area could play an important role&#13;
in managing the PA for biodiversity conservation.&#13;
41.   Key social issues in Gir concern the process of relocation, the implications of&#13;
tenure for forest villagers and the relationship between PA authorities and local people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  88                               Annex 6&#13;
Long-term, the Forest Department has a relocation plan for another 361 families presently&#13;
living in the Sanctuary. Some families appear willing to relocate in order to obtain better&#13;
economic returns by selling milk rather than milk products, and to gain access to health&#13;
and education facilities. A key factor in successful voluntary relocation of Maldhari&#13;
graziers will be the ability to provide alternatives that provide facilities and income equal&#13;
or superior to current conditions. The inability of forest villagers to obtain credit increases&#13;
pressures on PA authorities to change tenure status or provide income-generating&#13;
activities.&#13;
42.   In addition to small-scale agriculture and NTFP-collecting, (see Table I), forest&#13;
villagers continue to work in the shrinking forestry operations. As they lease their land&#13;
from the Forest Department for 15-year periods, they are unable to obtain mortgages in&#13;
order to raise funds for investment and are asking the Forest Department to convert leased&#13;
land to revenue areas. Although this demand clearly raises concern, PA management has&#13;
no plans to relocate forest villages.&#13;
Nagarhole National Park&#13;
Location&#13;
43.   Nagarhole National Park, in the Kodagu and Mysore districts of Kamataka state,&#13;
covers an area of 643.4 sq. kin, with a core zone of 192 sq. km. and a tourism zone of 1 10 sq.&#13;
km.&#13;
44.    The mostly undulating terrain ranges in altitude from 701 to 959 meters. Annual rainfall&#13;
runs about 177 cm, and temperatures range from 170 to 30° C. Sources of water include five&#13;
large perennial rivers and about 40 artificial water tanks, many used year-round.&#13;
45.    Forests dominate the area: southem tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, southern&#13;
tropical dry deciduous forests, southem tropical semi-evergreen forests (found only in patches&#13;
in the westem shelter parts of the park), teak plantations and, in the eastem parts of the park,&#13;
scrub forests resulting from heavy human pressure on the original dry deciduous forests. Small&#13;
areas of low-lying swamps, locally known as 'hadlus', are a unique and critical habitat,&#13;
providing ungulates with water and forage during the summer.&#13;
46.   Although some elements reflect its Westem Ghat classification, the Nagarhole National&#13;
Park resembles the Deccan Peninsula biogeographic zone in topography, vegetation and animal&#13;
life. Larger carnivores include tiger, leopard and wild dog; large ungulates include gaur, sambar&#13;
and chital. Four-homed antelope are found in the drier parts. Numerous bodies of water&#13;
support a rich assortment of birds such as the lesser whistling teal, adjutant stork, osprey,&#13;
shahin falcon and spoonbill. Marsh crocodiles are also important. Lower vertebrates and&#13;
invertebrates have not been studied at all.&#13;
People&#13;
47.   The total population in the project area was 72,652 as of the 1981 census. Over&#13;
6,888 (8%) belong to Scheduled Tribes of Jenu Kurbas, Betta Kurbas, Hakki-Pikki and&#13;
Yeravas, who live inside the park along with five non-tribal families. Within a 5-km radius&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                89                               Annex 6&#13;
of the boundaries PA authorities have identified a population of 66,507, in 96 revenue&#13;
villages, to participate in project activities. Findings from a PRA carried out in 14 of these&#13;
villages also identified Gowdas, Lingayaths, Odigas and Kodavas, as prominent social&#13;
groups in the area.&#13;
48.   The tribal groups who live in the park collect NTFP such as honey and fruit for&#13;
their own consumption (see Table 1) to supplement their income from labor at nearby&#13;
coffee estates and forestry operations. Some groups have already been resettled from the&#13;
core zone to areas they are no longer permitted to cultivate. Tribal groups still grow 40-50&#13;
ha of ragi and paddy in the park, however, supplemented by wild-collected foods. Non-&#13;
tribal people cultivate another 10 ha in a revenue enclave. On the fringes of the park are&#13;
settlements mainly of Odigas who cultivate 300 ha of land leased annually from the Forest&#13;
Department, and 300 ha of land for which they have tax receipts but no pattas. In addition&#13;
the tribal Yeravas encroach on another 300 ha of forest land in the north west.&#13;
49.   Outside the park, the primary occupation is agriculture. Most farmers grow ragi,&#13;
jowar, paddy and livestock; those with larger holdings grow tobacco and cotton as cash&#13;
crops. Marginal cultivators and the landless earn money by working at nearby coffee&#13;
estates and forestry operations, and collect NTFP.&#13;
50.   Nagarhole has demarcated two tourism zones. PA authorities provide&#13;
accommodation near the eastern side, where a complex has also been built by government&#13;
and leased to a private company for operations. On the southern boundary the Karnataka&#13;
state government operates a lodge near the Kabini Reservoir. Approximately 21,000&#13;
people from the region visited the park in 1992-1993. Local people gain little from&#13;
tourism other than the opportunity to labor in guesthouses.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
51.   The most important biodiversity value is the large predator/prey system. Herd densities&#13;
are amongst the highest in India, comparable even to the African savanna. The abundance of&#13;
small carnivores and water birds, again one of the highest in protected-area forests, is another&#13;
notable feature.&#13;
52.   As part of the 4500-sq. km Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Nagarhole is a significant&#13;
component of one of the largest conservation areas in India, and a central link in the seasonal&#13;
migrations of elephants to Bandipur National Park in the southeast and Wynad Wildlife&#13;
Sanctuary in the southwest.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
53.   The high density of wildlife in the park and the varied activities of the large human&#13;
population on its periphery result in problems for PA authorities and local people.&#13;
Important concerns include losing crop and livestock production, and human lives, to&#13;
elephants and other animals (somewhat contained by elephant-proof trenching); meeting&#13;
local demand for fuelwood (particularly for curing tobacco), timber and grazing (because&#13;
access to park resources is restricted); losing income because collecting NTFP is now&#13;
prohibited; poaching of elephants for ivory, and increasing tourism and tourism facilities in&#13;
the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 90                                Annex 6&#13;
54.   Agriculture inside the park threatens wildlife as swamps are drained and converted to&#13;
growing fields. About 5,000 head of cattle graze inside the park, mostly in the buffer zone,&#13;
leading to habitat degradation and weed invasion.&#13;
55.   Ninety sq. km of the park are planted with teak; large grazing animals may survive, but&#13;
biodiversity in general suffers.&#13;
56.   Considerable areas in the eastern parts are heavily degraded due to human pressures.&#13;
Ecorestoration efforts are going on in these areas with the planting of native species.&#13;
57.   The dry deciduous forest is very prone to fire during the dry season. In recent years,&#13;
major fires have caused extensive damage.&#13;
Social Considerations&#13;
58.   Tribal groups in the park have strong cultural attachments to their forests.&#13;
Traditional livelihoods and social organization depend on forest ecosystems, and forest&#13;
resources are key to local belief systems.&#13;
59.   Under the terms of the Indian Wildlife Act (1972) settlements within a national&#13;
park are considered illegal. PA authorities had therefore proposed that between 1993 and&#13;
1996, 1550 households currently residing within the park be relocated to forest areas on&#13;
the periphery. To date no relocation has occurred since funds for the approved plan have&#13;
yet to be released by the Government of India. A local human-rights NGO (Fedina Vikas)&#13;
has expressed concern over the relocation process, especially as it affects tribal non-&#13;
cultivators. Evidence suggests that they may be more willing to relocate, however, than&#13;
those who own or have access to arable land. Redefining park boundaries could be more&#13;
effective than resettlement as a means of resolving illegal habitation by farmers.&#13;
Meanwhile, plans to continue with relocation have been halted in order to gather&#13;
information on the extent of consent and possible terms of agreement, and to carry out a&#13;
small-scale anthropological and ecological study on tribal groups and their relationship&#13;
with natural resources in the area.&#13;
60.   A critical social issue in Nagarhole concerns tribal groups in the PA. The&#13;
establishment of a PA has restricted access to forest resources and affected traditional&#13;
livelihoods. Tribal groups are being incorporated into the larger commercial economy&#13;
outside the PA, as they pursue wage labor in nearby estates for necessary supplemental&#13;
income. Questions arise over the loss of indigenous knowledge and tribal cultural heritage,&#13;
and their ability to integrate successfully into a cash economy. The issue of current limited&#13;
access to PA resources, and possible further restrictions resulting from the new Forest&#13;
Conservation Act, will continue to strain relationships between PA authorities and other&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;

Palamau Tiger Reserve&#13;
Location&#13;
61.   Palamau Tiger reserve, located in the Palamau district in southwest Bihar, is 1026 sq.&#13;
km. in area. The core zone encompasses 213 sq. km, 766 sq. km of the buffer zone form the&#13;
Palamau Wildlife Sanctuary, and 47 sq. km is reserve forest. Some 29 sq. km of this area is&#13;
designated as a tourism zone. An area of 225 sq. km covering the current core area plus a&#13;
portion of the sanctuary is the intended area of the proposed Betla National Park. In the&#13;
southwest, the PA shares a border with the state of Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
62.   The terrain of the PA is undulating and hillier to the south, with altitudes ranging&#13;
between 300 m and 1140 m. Most of the annual 105-cm rainfall arrives with the southwest&#13;
monsoon; temperatures range from 10 C in winter to 480 C in summer. Only one river and a&#13;
few water tanks provide water year-round.&#13;
63.   The PA falls within the Deccan Peninsula biogeographic zone, in the Chhotanagpur&#13;
Plateau province. Forests are largely deciduous and, especially in the moister south, dominated&#13;
by sal. Vegetation is classified as moist and dry peninsular sal forests, northern secondary moist&#13;
and dry mixed deciduous forests; dry bamboo brakes; teak plantations; and grassy blanks&#13;
(discarded shifting cultivation areas).&#13;
64.   The large predator/prey system includes tiger, leopard, striped hyena, wolf, gaur,&#13;
sambar, barking deer and chital. More than 170 species of birds have been recorded. Lower&#13;
vertebrates and invertebrates have not been studied at all.&#13;
People&#13;
65.   Three villages (pop. 630, BSFD 1990) are found in the core zone; most of these&#13;
people are Scheduled Tribes of Oraon, Kherwar, Korwa, Munda and Brijia. According to&#13;
1991 census data, 30,795 people, in 102 villages, are located within legally excluded&#13;
enclaves in the sanctuary buffer area. Another 89 villages within a 5-km radius of the&#13;
sanctuary have been selected to participate in ecodevelopment activities, to give a total&#13;
population of 75,000 targeted for this project. While exact demographic figures are not&#13;
available, 1991 census data for the larger surrounding population of 99,907 indicate that&#13;
56% belong to Scheduled Tribes and 15% to Scheduled Castes. In addition to those&#13;
already mentioned, Scheduled Tribes in the area include Chero, Parahia and Birhor. The&#13;
target population includes 27 villages in and around the western portion of the sanctuary&#13;
which will be submerged and whose people will be resettled if the Kutku dam is built as&#13;
planned.&#13;
66.   Since forestry operations have been cut back, forest dwellers have become&#13;
increasingly dependent on agriculture and other forms of wage labor made available by PA&#13;
authorities. As with many similar settlements in India, security of tenure depends on&#13;
administrative decision-making by the Forest Department, which usually allows limited&#13;
access to grazing, fuelwood and small timber. Villages in the sanctuary are legally&#13;
excluded from the core zone but retain rights, subject to permission from the Forest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 92                              Annex 6&#13;
Department, to grazing, fuelwood, small timber, some NTFP and the production of lac&#13;
and tussar on the payment of royalties. The primary occupation of villagers in the&#13;
sanctuary is crop and livestock production, with some supplemental income from PA&#13;
management activities.&#13;
67.   Agriculture is also the main occupation of the population residing in revenue&#13;
villages in the remaining project area. Similar access to forest resources is permitted, and&#13;
additional benefits have been made available by the management of new protected forests.&#13;
68.   Tourism is currently restricted to the northern portion of the reserve. There are&#13;
plans to extend it, however, into part of the intended national park and current sanctuary.&#13;
The reserve had approximately 35,000 visitors in 1992, with October being the most&#13;
popular month. The extent of local participation in tourism is not known, but is unlikely to&#13;
extend beyond the provision of vehicles and occasional employment as guides.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
69.   The most important and characteristic value this PA has to offer is its highly-diverse&#13;
large predator/prey animal community, which includes a large population of elephants. The&#13;
fairly extensive and not severely-disturbed sal that covers most of the southern parts is among&#13;
the best forest in the state of Bihar. Several plants used in traditional medicine grow here.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
70.   Annual census estimates of larger mammals indicate that many species have increased&#13;
in number since 1987, while none have declined. Agriculture and subsistence gathering by&#13;
nearly 630 tribal people, however, and grazing by their nearly 700 head of cattle, strain the&#13;
resources of the core zone.&#13;
71.   Timber-smuggling and the ongoing extraction of bamboo and non-timber forest&#13;
products are a major source of disturbance and degradation in the buffer zone. 180 villages in&#13;
and around the buffer zone, with a cattle population of about 85,000, place heavy demands on&#13;
fuelwood, timber and fodder. Farmers resent crop and livestock losses due to predation.&#13;
Humans often cause forest fires, which destroy some 1.3% of the PA every year, degrading&#13;
natural forests and hampering regeneration in degraded areas.&#13;
72.   The Kutku Dam of the North Koel Multipurpose Hydroelectric Project, which&#13;
would flood 15 villages (of which 5 are within the tiger reserve), and affect access to&#13;
another 12 villages (of which 8 are within the tiger reserve), could indirectly threaten&#13;
Palamau. A ten-point action plan regarding relocation resulting from the Kutku Dam&#13;
would, according to PA officials and NGOs, prevent encroachment on the PA, but has yet&#13;
to be implemented. The Water Resources Department has not yet met the conditions in&#13;
the action plan. If nevertheless the dam proceeds, the Forest Department is concerned that&#13;
displaced villagers will seriously encroach on the reserve. Another possible area to be&#13;
submerged, the Auranga Reservoir in the western part of the reserve, also raises problems&#13;
of resettlement, but is currently only in an exploratory stage.&#13;

Social Considerations&#13;
73.   No information is available on sites of cultural significance in the project area.&#13;
However, tribal groups are likely to have strong cultural associations with forest&#13;
ecosystems, which supply key aspects of local indigenous belief systems.&#13;
74.   In 1984 a relocation plan for the three forest villages located in the core zone was&#13;
prepared and potential sites selected by villagers. Currently the PA has no plans for&#13;
relocation.&#13;
Pench Tiger Reserve&#13;
Location&#13;
75.   Located in the Seoni and Chindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh, Pench Tiger Reserve&#13;
covers an area of 757 sq. km, with a core zone (intended national park) of 293 sq. krn, a&#13;
tourism zone (intended national park) of 55 sq. km., a wildlife sanctuary of 118 sq. km and 308&#13;
sq. km of reserve and protected forests.&#13;
76.   The PA covers the southem lower ranges of the Satpura Hills and forms the catchment&#13;
for the Pench River, which runs through the center of the reserve. Rolling terrain includes hills&#13;
up to 650 m. Annual rainfall, mostly from the southwest monsoon, is about 120 cm;&#13;
temperatures range from 2.7°C in winter to 47.6°C in summer. Most streams and rivers are&#13;
seasonal; the main source of water during dry months is the Totladoh Reservoir, in the south&#13;
central part of the PA, formed as part of the Pench Hydel Project in 1990.&#13;
77.   As part of the Deccan Peninsula biogeographic zone, the reserve has extensive stands&#13;
of the dry deciduous teak and mixed forests typical of the central Indian highlands, though&#13;
much of the teak has been drowned. The area has been worked and subjected to shifting&#13;
cultivation in the past.&#13;
78.   The more open woodlands and savanna-type habitat support many herbivores and their&#13;
predators. Nearly 40 species of mammals and 168 species of birds have been recorded. Lower&#13;
vertebrates and invertebrates have not been studied.&#13;
People&#13;
79.   The 1981 census counted 50,000 people in the intended project area (99 revenue&#13;
villages), of whom Scheduled Tribes, primarily Gonds and their sub-divisions, comprise&#13;
46% and Scheduled Castes, 8%. Other social groups found in the area are Patels (usually&#13;
land-owners), Kirars and Ahirs (a Scheduled Caste). There are no villages within the&#13;
intended national park boundaries. Findings from the PRA carried out in over 10 villages&#13;
around the national park suggest that 80% of families suffer from varying degrees of&#13;
poverty, and that most of these families belong to Scheduled Tribes.&#13;
80.   For villagers living in and around the PA, agriculture and livestock production are&#13;
the primary occupation, with wheat, soybean and maize as the major crops and vegetable&#13;
production. Since many are marginal cultivators, and 45% of the employable workforce&#13;
does not have access to land, employment in forestry operations, wage labor, NTFP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  94                               Annex 6&#13;
collection (for food and supplemental income, see Table 1) and fishing are also important&#13;
sources of income. Villages on the south-eastern border (Seoni district) tend to be more&#13;
dependent on forest resources for both food and income. Scheduled Tribes and other&#13;
forest-fringe dwellers also have nistar rights, which subsidize access to forest resources&#13;
(primarily fuelwood).&#13;
81.   At present, visitors are allowed in a tourism zone in the eastern section of the&#13;
intended park, but future plans include another entry point in the southwest. Visits to the&#13;
reserve dropped dramatically from approximately 3,000 to 1,000 in 1992-93, when entry&#13;
was restricted to petrol vehicles. The limited accommodation available helps keep visitor&#13;
numbers low. Opportunities for local participation are restricted to occasional employment&#13;
as guides for visitors, a policy which the Forest Department hopes to promote further.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
82.   Although endemism and species richness per se are low (as is typical of Central Indian&#13;
highland regions), the PA maintains regional connectivity that is critical to the large&#13;
predator/prey system, by providing access to Kanha National Park through Rukhad forests.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
83.   Extensive harvesting of teak through the early 1900s drastically altered the original&#13;
vegetation in most of the forest. Grazing and fuelwood collection continue to degrade large&#13;
areas in the buffer zone. The core zone has been free of such impacts for many decades,&#13;
allowing restoration.&#13;
84.   There are no villages in the national park area, but with one in the sanctuary and a large&#13;
population on the periphery, human pressures continue to have a major impa;t on biodiversity:&#13;
(a)    Forest fires, at a rate of about 5 sq. km per year, degrade forests and prevent&#13;
regeneration.&#13;
(b)    Overgrazed areas have been invaded by weeds.&#13;
(c)    Crop depredation by chital, nilgai and wild boar is a major source of conflict&#13;
between villagers and forest managers.&#13;
85.   Many issues center around limits on access to forest resources brought about by&#13;
the establishment of the national park (grazing is still allowed in parts of the sanctuary):&#13;
NTFP collection, especially the extensive collection of tendu patta for cheroot production;&#13;
antler collection; fisheries prograrn in the reservoir and restrictions on fishing (and poaching in&#13;
response to outside-agency control of irfigation tanks and fisheries); declining employment&#13;
opportunities in forestry operations. Water shortage is a problem.&#13;
Social Considerations-&#13;
86.   Ecodevelopment efforts funded by Project Tiger currently extend to seven villages&#13;
and include irrigation improvements, pasture development and the provision of drinking&#13;
water.&#13;
87.   Relocation of villages inside the proposed National Park was completed in 1994,&#13;
with the relocation of 27 households from Chhedia. Under the terms agreed, each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                95                               Annex 6&#13;
household received 2.5 ha of unirrigated revenue land, housing, access to forest resources&#13;
plus employment opportunities in forestry operations. Forest Department officials&#13;
estimated that the process incurred expenses of Rs 49,000 per family. Forest Department&#13;
officials continue to support earlier relocated villages, providing employment opportunities&#13;
in forestry activities and general infrastructure.&#13;
88.   Key social issues in Pench include finding appropriate mechanisms for the active&#13;
participation of marginal social groups, such as women, landless and Scheduled Tribes, in&#13;
the microplanning process. The absence of NGOs able to participate in microplanning and&#13;
larger-scale monitoring activities is a concern. As access to forest resources and&#13;
employment decreases, successful alternative-income generating strategies will have to&#13;
adequately address the economic needs of those concerned without undermining their&#13;
cultural heritage. More information is required on local indigenous knowledge and cultural&#13;
associations with the PA.&#13;
89.   Data on cultural associations with the reserve is very limited, although information&#13;
on Gonds exists on a more general level for the state. Local people consider the Pench&#13;
River an important site for performing birth and death rites, and local tribal groups&#13;
celebrate several festivals in the PA.&#13;
Periyar Tiger Reserve&#13;
Location&#13;
90.   The Periyar Tiger Reserve, located in the Idukki district of Kerala, covers an area of&#13;
777 sq. kmi, of which 350 sq. km is the core zone (intended national park), 377 sq. km is&#13;
sanctuary buffer zone and 50 sq. km is a sanctuary tourism zone.&#13;
91.   In the southern half of the Western Ghat mountain range, the PA encompasses one of&#13;
India's 18 'biodiversity hot spots'. Situated at a general elevation of about 1,000 m (the highest&#13;
peak is 2,119 m), the hilly terrain gives rise to perennial and seasonal streams and rivers and&#13;
collects water for power generation in the Periyar reservoir. The area receives an annual rainfall&#13;
of about 250-3 50 cm, from the southwest and northeast monsoons; temperatures.&#13;
92.   Typical of the Western Ghat biogeographic province to which it belongs, the&#13;
vegetation consists mostly of closed forest, dominated by tropical wet evergreen and moist&#13;
deciduous forests and often including large areas of bamboo brakes. Montane grasslands take&#13;
over above 1500 m. The wet evergreen forests are most important in terms of biodiversity; the&#13;
more open moist deciduous forests host a large predator/prey system.&#13;
People&#13;
93.   PA authorities and national consultants (IIPA) identified a population of 225,000&#13;
(1981 census) within 2-km of the reserve for inclusion in the project. However, given the&#13;
limited duration of the current phase of the project, project planners need to reduce the&#13;
target population to a more manageable size. A revised target population of 58,144 would&#13;
select villages within the 2-km radius. Of these, 25% belong to Scheduled Castes and 4%&#13;
to Scheduled Tribes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 96                               Annex 6&#13;
94.   At present there are four settlements, total population 3,856, in the reserve. Three&#13;
(pop. 2,036) are tribal settlements of Mannans, Paijyans, Uralis and MalaArayans,&#13;
resettled from the core zone in the 1950s. The fourth settlement (pop. 1,820) is of landless&#13;
families given land in 1962 under the "Grow More Food Scheme". There are no plans to&#13;
relocate these groups who resettled just 30-40 years ago.&#13;
95.   Tribals living within the reserve pursue a variety of livelihood strategies. In the&#13;
case of Mannans, incomes often fluctuate dramatically, with 60% of the population being&#13;
seasonally poor. Fishing provides their primary source of income, supplemented by&#13;
cultivating pepper, collecting honey and resin and working for wages at nearby estates.&#13;
96.   Paliyan tribals sell fuelwood and honey and work in forestry operations, in addition&#13;
to farming. Urali tribals grow cash crops such as cardamon, oranges and coffee, in&#13;
addition to staple foods. Similarly, MalaArayans are agriculturists growing cash crops of&#13;
rubber, coffee and pepper as well as collecting NTFP (see Table 1). None of the resettled&#13;
tribal groups have title to the land they occupy and cultivate.&#13;
97.   Outside the reserve, in addition to working individual agricultural holdings, local&#13;
people earn wages at tea, coffee, cardamom and rubber estates. Households are not&#13;
clustered in traditional villages or hamlets but scattered throughout the landscape. Land is&#13;
cultivated intensively, producing both staple foods and cash crops. Some encroachment&#13;
has occurred on the northern boundary of the buffer zone.&#13;
98.   Periyar Tiger Reserve is a very popular destination for tourists and pilgrims.&#13;
During 1992-1993 an estimated 350,000 tourists and 30 million (from Forest Department&#13;
Plan; IIPA estimates 10 million) pilgrims visited parts of the reserve. The negative effects&#13;
of such huge numbers intensify as they cluster around river trips, popular driving routes&#13;
and the Sabarimala Shrine.&#13;
99.   Local people earn more from tourism as they establish tea-shops and lodges on the&#13;
periphery to serve visitors. Pilgrims also provide local economic opportunities, mostly as a&#13;
market for fuelwood rustled from the reserve.&#13;
100.  The temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala and, to a lesser extent, the&#13;
Mangaladevi temple, are important religious sites attracting large numbers of pilgrims&#13;
from the region and elsewhere. Tribal groups, particularly those residing on the fringes of&#13;
the reserve, also have strong cultural associations with forest areas, with forest resources&#13;
forming key components of indigenous belief systems.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
101.  About 5,000 of India's 15,000 species of flowering plants are found in Periyar's&#13;
expanse of wet evergreen forests (often called 'rainforests'). More than 150 new species and&#13;
15 new genera have been described in the last 30 years (Nair &amp; Daniel, 1986). About 60&#13;
genera, mostly monotypic, and 2,100 species are endemic to Western Ghats. Species richness&#13;
is especially high among bryophytes, pteridophytes, orchids and some select families.&#13;
102.  The wet evergreen forests also harbor a rich and endemic fauna., particularly among&#13;
lower vertebrates. Of 205 species of amphibians reported in India, some 120 are from the&#13;
Western Ghats and 85 are endemic. Large proportions of whole groups of amphibians are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 97                                Annex 6&#13;
endemic; for example, 14 out of India's 17 species of limbless amphibians (Caesilians). Some&#13;
groups of reptiles, such as lizards, show similar propensities. Al 33 species of burrowing&#13;
uropeltid snakes in India are from the Westem Ghats. Among fishes, nearly 60 species are&#13;
endemic to the Western Ghats.&#13;
103.  Species richness among birds and mammals isalso high with most of the species in the&#13;
peninsula represented. Endemism is largely confined to smaller mammals such as the lion-tailed&#13;
macaque, Nilgiri langur and the stripenecked mongoose. About 15 of 560 species of birds are&#13;
endemic.&#13;
104.  Available information on invertebrates indicates great species richness and endemism,&#13;
much of which remains to be documented. Western Ghats forests exhibit great richness and&#13;
endemism among butterflies (nearly 350 species) and moths (nearly 700 species) -the second&#13;
highest count in India.&#13;
105.  Apart from supporting a rich and endemic flora and fauna, the Periyar Tiger Reserve&#13;
also supports large populations of many species found elsewhere in India. The large&#13;
predator/prey system is complex. There is a large population of elephants. The small camivore&#13;
community is also well-represented, with 15 species.&#13;
106.  Periyar's forests connect with others outside its boundaries, especially to the south and&#13;
southeast. Although the Westem Ghats region has one of the best systems of protected areas in&#13;
India (Rodgers &amp; Panwar, 1985), the forests are highly fragmented. Periyar plays a key role in&#13;
maintaining the regional connectivity that ensures seasonal migration, dispersal, and genetic&#13;
flow of large- and medium-sized mammals, and birds.&#13;
107.  The area is the source of well-known and widely-used spices such as cardamom, black&#13;
pepper and cinnamon. Other plants are used in traditional and modem medicine, and in&#13;
industry.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
108.  Critical environmental issues for PA authorities concern the impacts of large&#13;
numbers of visitors and of commercial forestry within the reserve. Past investments in a&#13;
26-sq. km reservoir and in 55-sq. km of eucalyptus plantations are a significant presence. Very&#13;
few humans are in residence. Wildlife monitoring during the past few years shows no reduction&#13;
in numbers of large carnivores and ungulates. There are localized problems associated with&#13;
crop depredation by wild animals and demand for natural resources, particularly grazing&#13;
and fuelwood. Finally, PA authorities face a range of illicit activities such as timber-&#13;
smuggling, animal-poaching, NTFP collection and marijuana cultivation within the project&#13;
area.&#13;
109.  Threats to biodiversity include:&#13;
(a)    Pilgrimage: millions enter the reserve every year between November and June&#13;
to visit the Sabarimala Temple. Tree-cutting for fuelwood and minor&#13;
construction needs, accumulation of solid wastes, accidental fires and&#13;
disturbance to wildlife are serious problems.&#13;
(b)    Tourism: in the absence of altemative energy sources, fuelwood needs for&#13;
large numbers of tourists are mostly being met from within the PA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                98                               Annex 6&#13;
(c)   Hindustan Newsprints Ltd: the very existence of 55-sq. km of eucalyptus&#13;
plantation has a negative impact on the PA, since monocultures support only a&#13;
fraction of the native biodiversity. Felling operations disturb animals and often&#13;
lead to poaching.&#13;
(d)   Ganja cultivation is a major threat, because forests are often clear-felled for this&#13;
purpose and cultivators often engage in poaching. It is also a serious law-and-&#13;
order problem.&#13;
(e)   NTFP: a wide variety of non-timber forest products such as cinnamon,&#13;
danimar and honey are collected indiscriminately. Some of these activities have&#13;
direct impact; harvesting cinnamon bark often kills the tree. Indirect impacts&#13;
include accidental and intentional fires.&#13;
(f)    Fire: dry-season (December to May), forest fires are often man-made. They&#13;
affect mostly grasslands and the drier, often degraded, forests, hampering&#13;
regeneration.&#13;
Social Considerations&#13;
110.  Key social issues in Periyar concern the difficulties faced by tribal groups and the&#13;
management of cultural sites. Mannan tribals experience seasonal poverty due to an&#13;
inability to manage large amounts of cash influxes from cash crop sales. Coordinated&#13;
efforts are clearly required to address this problem and help integration into the larger&#13;
economy. Given increasing restrictions on access to forest resources, alternative&#13;
livelihoods for traditional forest-dwellers will need to be both culturally sensitive and&#13;
economically feasible. There is also a need to manage cultural sites and visitors in the PA&#13;
in a manner which would minimize negative environmental impacts and increase support&#13;
for biodiversity conservation.&#13;
Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve&#13;
Location&#13;
111.  Located in the Sawai Madhopur district in southeastern Rajasthan, the Ranthambhore&#13;
Tiger Reserve covers an area of 1334.6 sq. km, consisting of a national park of 392.5 sq. kin,&#13;
(274.5 core zone and 118 sq. km buffer zone) the Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary (127.6 sq. km),&#13;
Keladevi Sanctuary (674 sq. km), Kawalji Game Reserve (7.6 sq. km) and some reserved and&#13;
protected forests (132.9 sq. km).&#13;
112.  The Aravallis and Vindhyan mountain ranges meet in this area, presenting two different&#13;
geological formations. Altitude ranges from 215 m to 507 m, temperatures range between 40&#13;
and 470 C, and the annual rainfall is about 80 cm. There are six lakes and three perennial&#13;
streams within the PA.&#13;
113.  Classified as being in the semi-arid biogeographic zone, Gujrat-Rajwara province, the&#13;
dominant vegetation in the reserve is tropical dry deciduous and dry mixed deciduous forest.&#13;
Human impact in many areas has reduced the original vegetation to dry deciduous scrub and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 99                              Annex 6&#13;
grasslands, the latter presently having important wildlife values. The vegetation in the plateau is&#13;
grassland and open woodland, dominated by drought-resistant species such as Anogeissus&#13;
pendula, Acacia catechu and Boswellia serrata.&#13;
114.  The rich assemblage of large predators/prey includes tiger, leopard, striped hyena,&#13;
chital, sambar, nilgai and Indian gazelle. Other species of interest are caracal, ruddy mongoose,&#13;
several water birds and marsh crocodile. Nothing is known about the lower vertebrates and&#13;
invertebrates.&#13;
People&#13;
115.  National consultants identified 211,695 people within 10 km of the reserve to be&#13;
included in the project. Considering limits on time and facilities for the current phase of&#13;
the project, this number has been reduced to 64,000.&#13;
116.  WWF-India (1994) identified 85,000 people, in 85 villages, for possible inclusion&#13;
in ecodevelopment activities. Four more villages, with a population of 1,210, are on or&#13;
very close to national park boundaries; another 3,067 people live in Kailadevi and Sawai&#13;
Mansingh sanctuaries. Project activities would need to address major urban settlements&#13;
near reserve boundaries, such as Sawai Madhopur, Khandar and Karauli (combined&#13;
population, 82,000). Data on the reduced target population indicate that 13% are Berwas&#13;
(a Scheduled Caste) and 32% Meenas, the dominant Scheduled Tribe. Other groups&#13;
include Gujjars (25%) and Malis (15%). (Khan, 1994)&#13;
117.  Most area villagers live on crop and livestock production, supplemented by some&#13;
income from NTFP (see Table 1). Agricultural villages occupy revenue land and have&#13;
variable access to communally-held forest land and various types of state forests. Primarily&#13;
pastoralist communities of Gujjars keep buffaloes and cattle, and depend economically on&#13;
the sale of milk products. The reserve, and particularly the outlying sanctuaries, lie on the&#13;
migratory routes of nomadic sheep herders. Tourism is becoming an increasingly&#13;
important activity for urban settlements, especially Sawai Madophur, although it is unclear&#13;
whether local residents capture much of the tourist expenditure.&#13;
118.  Approximately 29,000 tourists and 180,000 pilgrims visited the reserve during&#13;
1992-93. Most tourists base their visits in Sawai Madhopur, where a number of private&#13;
and state hotels and guest-houses are run mostly by out-of-town entrepreneurs. PA&#13;
authorities have made efforts to increase local participation by training guides, whose&#13;
employment represents only a small part of tourist expenditure. Other opportunities for&#13;
local people appear to be limited to employment in hotels and guest houses.&#13;
119.  Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve protects a significant cultural heritage in addition to&#13;
wildlife. Like the Kailadevi and Ganesh temples, which attract large numbers of pilgrims,&#13;
Ranthambhore Fort (built in 994 AD) has come to define the landscape around it.&#13;
Resettled villagers continue to visit places of religious significance associated with their&#13;
original village location.&#13;
120.  Twelve villages were resettled from the national park between 1976 and 1979.&#13;
Terms agreed at the time have gradually materialized; e.g., legal title to land and facilities&#13;
such as schools. There are proposals for relocation of four more villages, inhabited mainly&#13;
by Gujiars, from close to the park boundary. Two villages, Padra and Kuthkuli, have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                100                              Annex 6&#13;
expressed some interest. As elsewhere, those without cultivable land appear to be more&#13;
willing to relocate than those with access to land. The other two villages, Indala and&#13;
Mohdungri have also reported some interest in moving if they receive land of their choice.&#13;
Biodiversity Values&#13;
121.  In undisturbed semi-arid areas, palatable grass and shrubs support one of the highest-&#13;
biomass livestock populations, although species diversity and endemism per se are low.&#13;
Ranthambhore, with its complex grazing system and rich assemblage of large predators/prey,&#13;
typifies its biogeographic zone. Pure stands of Anogeissuspendula, characteristic of the&#13;
Aravilli Hill ranges, has almost disappeared from most of its range except the Ranthambhore&#13;
Tiger Reserve. As a forested hill tract, the reserve plays an important role in soil and water&#13;
conservation.&#13;
Biodiversity Pressures&#13;
122.  Not extensively worked in the past, the core zone remains free of the heavy human&#13;
pressure suffered by the rest of the PA in the present. Villagers and urban residents place&#13;
intense demand on natural resources in other zones, particularly for grazing and fuelwood,&#13;
which at present cannot be satisfied outside the reserve. As fuelwood requirements for&#13;
numerous villages and a few large towns are gathered from the PA, large areas are severely&#13;
degraded, affecting plant and animal commnunities.&#13;
123.  Nearly 250,000 head of cattle are seasonally dependent on resources in the PA, mostly&#13;
outside the core zone, firther degrading large areas. Wildlife and livestock end up in direct&#13;
competition; native vegetation lacks time to regenerate; weeds invade. Meanwhile, some&#13;
villagers on the periphery report losing up to 30% of their crops to wild animals.&#13;
124.  Although poaching, often by the Moghia tribe, had been chronic to this area, in recent&#13;
years there has been a reported increase that especially threatens PA tigers.&#13;
125.  The increasing numbers of visitors to the reserve pose problems of PA&#13;
management, since tourists concentrate in the core zone, and pilgrims at temple sites.&#13;
Social Considerations&#13;
126.  Ranthambhore has a history of hostile relationships between local people and PA&#13;
authorities, problems of coordination among NGOs and PA authorities, delays in terms&#13;
and processes of resettlement, and increasing pressures on resources from growing urban&#13;
and rural populations. Outsider encroachment on village common lands removes that land&#13;
from use for fuelwood and fodder plantations. Indigenous and local knowledge can make&#13;
important contributions toward ecological restoration in the buffer zone and relieving the&#13;
pressures on the PA.&#13;

Annex 7: Improved PA Management':&#13;
Overview&#13;
1     Improved PA management would use specialist advice, studies, workshops,&#13;
associated travel costs, training, and staff to:&#13;
(a)   Improve PA planning processes and building capacity to&#13;
(i)   improve PA management plans&#13;
(ii)   incorporate PA concerns into regional planning and regulation&#13;
(b)   Protect and manage ecosystems and habitats within the PA to:&#13;
(i)   restore ecosystems and habitats&#13;
(ii)   control fire, poaching, and animals&#13;
(iii)   manage enterprise and visitor enclaves and&#13;
(c)    Upgrade PA amenities for field staff.&#13;
Improving PA Planning Processes&#13;
Strengthening PA Management Plans&#13;
2.    Context. Management plans exist for all seven project protected areas (PAs). They&#13;
usually cover a 5 to 10 year implementation period. However, most of these plans have&#13;
expired or will need updating in the next few years (see Annex 2). These plans are also not&#13;
as comprehensive as they ought to be; in particular they do not take fully into account the&#13;
links between PAs and the local people who depend on the resources contained within&#13;
them. In addition, PA plans are not adequately integrated into the broader ecological,&#13;
socioeconomic and regional sphere. Forest department staff have largely managed as PA&#13;
islands set aside from development&#13;
3.    Additions. Revision of PA plans would include, in addition to normal updating,&#13;
specific consideration of:&#13;
(a)    More complete incorporation of ecological considerations in PA&#13;
management&#13;
(b)   Broadening participation and cooperation of local people and outside&#13;
groups&#13;
(c)   Incorporation of initiatives supported under other project components.&#13;
4.    Incorporation of Ecological Considerations. Management of ecological systems&#13;
within PAs requires an understanding and appreciation of ecological principles and&#13;
processes operating in and around the PA and the acceptance of the concept that PA&#13;
Guidelines subject to revision to reflect experience in practice. Revision will be documented through&#13;
exchanges of letters and comprehensive updating as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               102                             Annex 7&#13;
management is a specialized form of land use. The context of the project PAs gives scope&#13;
for improving ecological planning and management. Some specific issues for consideration&#13;
in PA planning are:&#13;
(a)   Rationalization of PA boundaries. Most PA boundaries and the&#13;
demarcation of core, buffer, tourism, and other use zones are largely&#13;
defined on administrative or legal bases. They often do not reflect&#13;
protection requirements for the full range of ecosystems or species in the&#13;
area. Ecological considerations include the protection of representative&#13;
samples of ecologically important habitats and migratory routes of far&#13;
ranging species, and the adequacy of the shape and size of PAs needed to&#13;
cover the entire range of botanical, ecological, and geomorphological&#13;
features. Ecological boundaries used as the basis for defining PA limits and&#13;
zoning may also increase the potential for maintaining and establishing links&#13;
or corridors between isolated wildlife populations whose members have&#13;
been fragmented by human interference and physical barriers.&#13;
Rationalization would also take into account the tenure rights of local&#13;
people (including customary tenure rights of tribals) living within the&#13;
protected areas. Currently there is very little information available for each&#13;
PA to provide a sufficient basis for an ecological approach to PA&#13;
management. The project would therefore support the preparation of&#13;
baseline ecosystems maps for each PA. These maps would include&#13;
information on the distribution and diversity of ecosystems within and&#13;
adjacent to the PAs. They would also include other information such as&#13;
geomorphological features, distribution of communication systems,&#13;
regional development features, location of villages, land use, and so forth.&#13;
They would be used for making decisions as to the management and zoning&#13;
of land within and outside the PAs. Boundary changes, if any, resulting&#13;
from the rationalization analysis would be envisaged as a one-time decision;&#13;
because continuing boundary changes could undermine regulatory&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
(b)   Management of forests and other lands surrounding PAs. A crucial&#13;
element in conservation strategies is the protection of biodiversity outside&#13;
the PAs as well as inside. Reliance on PAs alone risks creating a siege&#13;
mentality rigorously protective of species and communities inside the&#13;
boundaries, while exposing those outside to practices that promote their&#13;
exploitation or destruction. Most of the project PAs are bordered by&#13;
reserve forests managed for timber, bamboo, and non-forest products, with&#13;
little or no consideration for the conservation of biodiversity. The project&#13;
would consider mutually enhancing ways to promote conservation in both&#13;
PAs and their surrounding areas. This would enable PA plans to&#13;
recommend improvements to operations in surrounding areas that would&#13;
enhance biological diversity and ecological conditions in buffer and fringe&#13;
zones. The plans would include workshops and technical support for the&#13;
review, development, and coordination of ecologically friendly guidelines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               103                            Annex 7&#13;
to be incorporated into forest working plans and other land use operations&#13;
and mechanisms. PA authorities should coordinate with the territorial and&#13;
production arms of their respective forestry departments and other land&#13;
development agencies in developing and implementing the new guidelines.&#13;
(c)   Protection of ecosystems and habitats. More often than not, PAs are&#13;
managed with an emphasis on the conservation of the larger, charismatic&#13;
species found within the PA (tiger, elephant, leopard, lion, etc.). These&#13;
species are the more important, and often the most threatened species in&#13;
the PAs. However, specific strategies and management interventions are&#13;
necessary not only to protect the individual species, but to also preserve the&#13;
larger ecosystems in which they live, and to meet India's obligations under&#13;
international conventions (e.g., Ramsar). PA planning updates should&#13;
therefore emphasize an ecological approach with a view to managing the&#13;
totality of botanical and zoological species and ecosystems in the area,&#13;
including boundaries and linkages between ecosystems such as riparian&#13;
fringes, floodplains, and other similar habitats.&#13;
5.    Broadening Participation and Cooperation of Local People and Outside&#13;
Groups. Since ecodevelopment is considered to encompass all interactions between&#13;
people and PAs, the full range of options available to PA managers to enhance the inter-&#13;
relationships should be taken into consideration in PA planning.&#13;
(a)   Processes for stakeholder participation in decision making through&#13;
direct consultation, representation on committees, participation in&#13;
planning workshops, etc. People living in and around PAs are dependent&#13;
on PA resources and are the most affected by the establishment of a PA,&#13;
but are rarely invited to participate in decisions regarding its management.&#13;
This has often alienated PA neighbors. Similarly PAs have lost support and&#13;
face increased outside threats from other agencies and stakeholders who&#13;
have been left out of PA planning. PA planners would provide an&#13;
opportunity for these groups, including NGOs, to take part in the updating&#13;
of PA plans. Planning workshops and informal village-level meetings would&#13;
identify ways of involving local groups more directly in PA management..&#13;
(b)   Mitigation (within the PA boundaries) of negative impacts of PAs on&#13;
people. Damage to crops and livestock caused by wildlife in areas&#13;
surrounding PAs is a major cause of hostility towards PAs. Such hostility&#13;
will block effective village ecodevelopment programs if relations between&#13;
PAs and local people are not improved through measures to reduce the&#13;
impact of crop damage. The problems of crop damage would be discussed&#13;
as a supplement to the participatory microplanning of village&#13;
ecodevelopment. Measures for their mitigation could include research on&#13;
animal behavior, and the location of site-specific solutions to problems&#13;
within the PA boundaries in consultation with the affected people.&#13;
(c)   Winning cooperation of local people by sharing PA byproducts and&#13;
employment opportunities. Past experience has shown that PA relations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               104                             Annex 7&#13;
with local inhabitants can be enhanced when people see the PA as&#13;
providing them with direct benefits and have a long-term stake in sustaining&#13;
resources. Such opportunities exist. An interpretation of the Wildlife&#13;
Protection Act allows the chief wildlife warden of each state to restore&#13;
habitats within the PA to improve conditions for wildlife. If properly&#13;
structured and implemented, this provides for generous benefit sharing&#13;
arrangements of PA byproducts such as teak removal, employment,&#13;
cutting grass from firelines, sustainable NTFP collection, etc. These&#13;
benefits would be of mutual benefit to both the PA and local people and&#13;
forge cooperation. Similarly tribal villagers with intimate knowledge of the&#13;
PA can be given preference for employment as PA staff. Employment&#13;
opportunities also exist in infrastructure construction, road maintenance,&#13;
anti-poaching programs, community protection groups, etc.&#13;
(d)   Developing cost and benefit sharing arrangements for PA enterprises.&#13;
New strategies for tourism and visitor management in PAs could also&#13;
provide direct benefits to local people and scope for broadening local&#13;
participation in management and benefit-sharing. Such opportunities could&#13;
include enterprise operation and ownership of tourism facilities, provision&#13;
of guide services, handicrafts, catering, etc. Revenue could be captured and&#13;
shared by designating a portion of entry fees, licenses, concessions,&#13;
royalties, commercial use of indigenous knowledge, and so forth to local&#13;
participants. Of particular importance to the project would be studies&#13;
aimed at ensuring financial sustainability of PAs beyond the life of the&#13;
project and at developing participatory ecotourism strategies.&#13;
(e)   Developing inter-agency linkages in support of PAs.. Alliances would&#13;
be forged through formal (state or PA-level coordinating committees,&#13;
planning workshops, etc.) and informal mechanisms. Such linkages have&#13;
several purposes.&#13;
(i)    Leveraging financial and political support. Agencies whose&#13;
work depends on the benefits derived from the protection of natural&#13;
areas can be supportive of the PA authority even when they are not&#13;
directly involved. Examples are links between the irrigation sector&#13;
that depends on the watershed value of the PA to support&#13;
downstream water development works, or the public and private&#13;
tourism development agencies that depend on PA resources for&#13;
attracting visitors. In some of the project PAs there are&#13;
opportunities for direct cooperation with these agencies to generate&#13;
resources and benefits for local people and thereby win support for&#13;
the PA. In Nagarhole, PA authorities and the Taj Group of Hotels&#13;
have a common interest in maintaining the health of the PA and&#13;
should work together to ensure the reduction of threats to the PA&#13;
and the protection of its resources&#13;
(ii)   Disseminating PA plans Political support is needed for adequate&#13;
funding. PA management plans would be widely circulated in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                105                               Annex 7&#13;
form and content that is easily understood by local people who tend&#13;
to see PAs as chunks of productive land that are legally&#13;
inaccessible.. Specific awareness and publicity programs should be&#13;
launched in each PA to gain support for conservation.&#13;
(iii)   Debating critical PA issues. Such issues are usually complex and&#13;
sociopolitical and can have such wide ranging repercussions, that a&#13;
resolution may lie beyond the scope of the PA manager. The&#13;
project establishes channels for ensuring wider discussion of these&#13;
issues that include PA planning workshops, inter-agency&#13;
coordination fora, special studies, etc. In resolving interagency&#13;
land-use conflicts and overlaps in planning, it is suggested that PA&#13;
management authorities strive to establish such a relationship within&#13;
the overall framework of the state-level coordinating committees.&#13;
PA management authorities should have at their disposal sufficient&#13;
resources to bring technical support for examining the conflicts and&#13;
defining mutually beneficial resolution of them based on scientific&#13;
study and analysis.&#13;
(iv)   Integrating implementation with efforts by different local&#13;
agencies and specialized groups. Channels of coordination,&#13;
collaboration, and information sharing would be created under the&#13;
project with research, education, and planning programs and NGO&#13;
networks to help harmonize activities. PA management authorities&#13;
should take the initiative in using these channels to ensure&#13;
complementarity of activities and a more effective deployment of&#13;
financial and manpower resources. For example, hydrological&#13;
investments could include the protection of reservoirs or catchment&#13;
areas that would cover a portion of the PA management costs.&#13;
Another possible result would be the modification of timber harvest&#13;
patterns in PA surroundings to reduce damage to the environment&#13;
or wildlife.&#13;
6.    Financial Sustainability Strategy. The project would support a state-level&#13;
strategy study on financial sustainability. For most states, it would not be politically&#13;
feasible to expect to adopt this strategy within the first two years of the project, so the PA&#13;
management plan would reflect the current status of the strategy. Terms of reference for&#13;
the strategy study, are included at the end of this annex.&#13;
7.    Incorporation of Initiatives Supported Under Other Project Components.&#13;
The revised PA plans would also incorporate project initiatives such as the integration of&#13;
PA concerns into regional plans (described below), the operation of village&#13;
ecodevelopment activities (Annex 8), environmental education and visitor management&#13;
(Annex 9), monitoring and research (Annex 10), project management(Annex 11),&#13;
environmental review (Annex 17) social assessment (Annex 18), and people in the PAs&#13;
(Annex 20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               106                             Annex 7&#13;
8.    Steps to Improve PA Management Plans. In order to address current&#13;
inadequacies and bring in new considerations for improving PA plans, the Wildlife&#13;
Institute of India (WII) would be contracted to review existing PA plans, develop draft&#13;
guidelines for plan update, organize a national workshop to consider the draft guidelines,&#13;
and provide training to PA staff for preparation of revised plans, (see terms of reference in&#13;
Annex 11). The project would also support interdisciplinary planning teams, PA-level&#13;
workshops, publicity for management plans, and arrangements for plan updating on a&#13;
continuing basis. The process would include the following steps&#13;
(a)   Establishing Broad Operational Framework. WII would review the&#13;
existing PA plans of the seven project areas to determine how far they meet&#13;
the considerations described above. A national workshop, including&#13;
representatives from the seven project PAs, would formulate guidelines for&#13;
updating PA plans. The strategy would incorporate procedures for&#13;
updating the plans, would identify technical and scientific support needed,&#13;
and define a schedule for preparing the plans.&#13;
(b)   Agreement on PA-Level Framework. The broad national strategy would&#13;
provide the basis for adjustment to meet site-specific needs. Workshops at&#13;
the PA level would identify key issues and define approaches for identifying&#13;
and integrating regional and local concerns. Regional development agencies&#13;
and other stakeholder groups, NGOs, local community representatives, etc.&#13;
would be consulted and participate in these workshops.&#13;
(c)   Special studies to address PA concerns. As part of the plan revision&#13;
process, the project would support specific studies for each PA. Studies&#13;
would include, for example, development education and awareness&#13;
strategies, assessment of environmental impacts of specific regional&#13;
development programs on PAs (e.g. impact of the North Koel hydropower&#13;
project on Palamau in Bihar, impact of fisheries development in Pench in&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, etc.). Strategies to be supported under the project would&#13;
include ecotourism development strategies for Periyar in Kerala, Pench in&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, and Ranthambhore in Rajasthan; a strategy for&#13;
management of the Sabrimala Temple enclave in Periyar (Kerala), etc.&#13;
Since baseline maps of the PAs are not comprehensive or do not exist, the&#13;
project would provide support for the preparation of these maps. The&#13;
recommendations of the studies would be incorporated into the respective&#13;
PA plans.&#13;
(d)   Form Planning Team. Previous PA plans have been prepared by a single&#13;
individual or a small group of forest department staff However, the&#13;
updates require new components, such as regional and policy evaluations,&#13;
that, would need the services of an inter-disciplinary team. The necessary&#13;
mix of skills in planning, ecology, sociology, regional development, etc. is&#13;
not available within the PA staff. These services would, therefore, have to&#13;
be drawn from outside agencies, NGOs, and planning institutions so the&#13;
project would provide financial resources for PA update, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               107                              Annex 7&#13;
hiring of specific technical services, as and when required. PA managers&#13;
would select a planning officer for each PA who would coordinate and&#13;
guide the revision of the plan. The planning officer would either be the PA&#13;
manager himself (if he has the time) or another officer, working in close&#13;
collaboration with him. These officers would be provided training at the&#13;
WII in plan preparation.&#13;
(e)   Gather basic background information and prepare the plan. To be&#13;
done after the PA-level workshops and concurrently with the special policy&#13;
and technical studies in support of PA planning. This will consist of review&#13;
of all materials available, enabling legislation, socioeconomic and cultural&#13;
information; field inventory and collection of new and additional data;&#13;
review of potential effects of regional development activities and special&#13;
requirements of adjacent inhabitants; and compilation of the plan This&#13;
process is expected to take about 8 to 12 months and would include&#13;
regular consultations with technical specialists, regional development&#13;
agencies, NGOs, local communities, etc.&#13;
(f)    Finalize and publicize plan. Before finalization, all stakeholder groups,&#13;
regional, local, and national, as well as the Bank would have the&#13;
opportunity to review the plan and to comment on its recommendations in&#13;
order to better ensure consensus and understanding. An environmental&#13;
impact review by a national institution contracted for the purpose, would&#13;
ensure that plan recommendations are in keeping with the objectives of&#13;
conservation of biodiversity and beneficial to the environment. This is&#13;
recommended to give more legitimacy to PA plans, since they currently&#13;
have no legal status or approval process. PA managers would ensure&#13;
publicity for finalized plans, to broaden understanding, awareness, and&#13;
acceptance among regional agencies, community groups, and politicians.&#13;
(g)   Establish arrangements for plan updating on a continuing basis in the&#13;
future.&#13;
Incorporating PA Concerns into Regional Planning and Regulation&#13;
9.    Context.. Local and regional activities in the vicinity of PAs, including the&#13;
programs of other development agencies, may threaten the integrity of PAs or the&#13;
implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy.. Examples of possible threats in the seven&#13;
project PAs include the North Koel multipurpose hydroelectric project in Palamau, the&#13;
potential reservoir and irrigation conveyance project in Buxa, and fisheries development in&#13;
the reservoir in Pench (for more information and other examples see Annex 6). PAs can be&#13;
successful in realizing their long-term conservation goals only to the extent that their&#13;
priorities can become integrated into large scale land use planning initiatives and&#13;
regulations at the local and regional levels. To attain this, PA managers need to identify&#13;
and assess at an early stage, activities with the potential for harming PAs.&#13;
10.   Project Covenant on Regional Impacts. On a more specific level, project&#13;
investments would be cost effective only to the extent to which activities outside the scope&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report              108                            Annex 7&#13;
of the project do not undermine the project objectives and strategy. To address this&#13;
concern, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the state and national governments&#13;
would take steps acceptable to the Bank to ensure that activities outside the scope of the&#13;
project would not undermine biodiversity conservation within the PAs, and would not&#13;
undermine the implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy in and around the PAs. To&#13;
accomplish this, the government would apply its own environmental assessment&#13;
regulations and would also incorporate additional standards described below. If the&#13;
government proceeded with an activity that undermined conservation or the&#13;
ecodevelopment strategy according to the criteria listed below, the project would cease to&#13;
provide financing to that PA.&#13;
11.   Criteria to Assess Adverse Impacts. Regional activities would undermine&#13;
biodiversity conservation in a project PA or undermine the ecodevelopment strategy if&#13;
they cause:&#13;
(a)   A probable increase in the level of encroachment into the PA that is not&#13;
adequately mitigated. This would include displacement of people by&#13;
submergence from a dam in the vicinity of a PA without an effective&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation program to mitigate PA encroachment.&#13;
Bank experience has demonstrated that careful consultation with affected&#13;
people and restoration of the incomes would be essential in this situation.&#13;
(b)   Probable disruption of migrations of ecologically important species---for&#13;
example, net loss of wildlife corridors.&#13;
(c)   Fragmentation, or other change in legal status of any part of the PA that&#13;
would materially and adversely affect the viability of ecologically important&#13;
ecosystems and species&#13;
(d)   Fragmentation, or other change in legal status of any part of the PA that&#13;
would materially and adversely affect the ecodevelopment strategy of&#13;
decreasing negative interactions and increasing collaboration between local&#13;
people and government managers. To be consistent with the&#13;
ecodevelopment strategy, conversion, fragmentation, or changes in legal&#13;
status would need to comply with the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20&#13;
on Indigenous People, which is described in Annex 20. This would include&#13;
recognizing and resolving the customary tenure rights of indigenous&#13;
people.&#13;
(e)   Displacement of people in and around the PAs in ways that would&#13;
materially and adversely affect the project strategy of decreasing negative&#13;
interactions and increasing collaboration between local people and&#13;
government managers. As in the case of (a) above, Bank experience has&#13;
demonstrated that that careful consultation with affected people and&#13;
restoration of the incomes would be essential.&#13;
12.   Application of Criteria. Project support for regional planning and regulation&#13;
would provide the mechanism for the project staff to ensure compliance with the project&#13;
covenant on regional impacts. During the first year of the project there would be an initial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               109                              Annex 7&#13;
inventory and preliminary assessment of existing and proposed activities that would&#13;
include advice on extent of adverse impact and need for environmental assessment or&#13;
other follow-up actions (see terms of reference in Annex I 1). This exercise would result in&#13;
one of the four possible outcomes:&#13;
(a)   The CCF (Wildlife) may be able to immediately certify that the activities&#13;
would have no adverse impacts.&#13;
(b)   Situations where impacts are minimal and do not require full assessment&#13;
may, instead of a full environmental assessment, require interagency&#13;
discussions and adjustment to meet PA and wildlife interests as represented&#13;
by the CCF (Wildlife).&#13;
(c)   The CCF (Wildlife) may be able to immediately recognize that the likely&#13;
impact of the activities would be adverse according to the above criteria,&#13;
would not be possible to mitigate, and therefore should not proceed.&#13;
(d)   PA authorities may decide that the activities need a full environmental&#13;
assessment and/or resettlement plan including scoping/baseline survey,&#13;
consultation, management plans, and monitoring plans. MOEF would then&#13;
review this environmental assessment and/or resettlement plan, making use&#13;
of existing environmental protection regulations and the project guidance&#13;
on resettlement best practise. MOEF would then require that the proposed&#13;
development program include adequate funds to implement, manage and&#13;
monitor the environmental management and/or resettlement plan. During&#13;
the review, MOEF may conclude that the likely impact of the activities&#13;
would be adverse according to the above criteria, would not be possible to&#13;
mitigate, and therefore should not proceed. In addition to monitoring by&#13;
the sponsoring agency, the CCF, Wildlife, with support of contracted&#13;
specialists as necessary, would independently monitor the implementation&#13;
of the environmental mangement and/or resettlement plan on behalf of&#13;
MOEF.&#13;
13.   Conflict Resolution. Conflicts raised by stakeholders, NGOs, and others over the&#13;
application of criteria that cannot be resolved by the state CCF, Wildlife or by MOEF&#13;
officials responsible for environmental assessment compliance, would be refered to the&#13;
Project Steering Committee, which would include NGOs and other contracted specialists&#13;
involved with the project at the national level. The Bank would be kept informed of these&#13;
conflicts and their resolution. The project also provides monitoring and independent NGO&#13;
studies which may identify potential conflicts and suggest possible resolutions. The Bank&#13;
review would focus on whether the Government is complying with the agreed guidelines&#13;
and procedures. The Bank would also retain the authority to interpret and apply the&#13;
regional impacts covenant as necessary.&#13;
14.   Capacity Building. Project support would not focus solely on enforcement of the&#13;
legal covenant. The project would help PA authorities to develop appropriate mechanisms&#13;
that would provide the continuous and sustainable detection and monitoring of outside&#13;
activities. Under a project contract, an expert instititution would develop guidelines for the&#13;
integration of PA concerns into regional planning and regulation, including detection,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               110                              Annex 7&#13;
assessment, and monitoring (see Annex 11 for terms of reference). The contracted&#13;
institution would investigate the application of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) in&#13;
the PA context. In particular the contractor would identify the nature and scope of actions&#13;
to be prescribed, describe the permissible limits of applicability of the law, and recommend&#13;
the next steps to strengthen appropriate monitoring, regulation, and enforcement&#13;
mechanisms. The contractor would also identify adjustments required for investment&#13;
proposals that have already received environmental clearnance based on earlier, less&#13;
comprehensive standards. Where necessary, contractor would obtain assistance from other&#13;
specialists (e.g., resettlement specialists, anthropologists and tribal representatives). The&#13;
project would help PA authorities to acquire the minimum skills needed to recognize the&#13;
major potential impacts of surrounding developments. The project would also fund&#13;
technical expertise to analyze conflicts and develop appropriate strategies for mitigation&#13;
and avoidance.&#13;
15.   Environmental Site Review. When used wisely and early in the planning phase,&#13;
site review associated with environmental assessments (EA) can be an important&#13;
regulatory control for protection of PA resources. Wherever possible, PA authorities&#13;
should attempt to persuade agencies concerned to consider alternative sites or routes&#13;
outside the PAs, or to take adequate precautions to avoid or reduce adverse impacts on&#13;
the PA. For large-scale proposed investment proposals in the vicinity of the PAs, the&#13;
project would make use of existing environmental protection regulations that give special&#13;
notified status to the areas surrounding PAs. The project would also include provision to&#13;
analyze smaller-scale activities in the vicinity of the PA at the local level, as well as&#13;
project-related investments themselves. Each PA would obtain the services of an&#13;
ecologist and sociologist on contract to assist the PA authorities address the&#13;
environmental and social concerns of both project and non-project activities. The project&#13;
would also include guidance and specialized support for continuing environmental review&#13;
and social assessment of proposed project investments.&#13;
16.   Resettlement Caused by Non-Project Activities. Non-project activities causing&#13;
resettlement could affect the project either by contributing to encroachment into fragile&#13;
parts of the PA or by undermining the spirit of collaboration being established through the&#13;
ecodevelopment strategy. To prevent these negative impacts, resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation for these activities would need to incorporate best practice, including (a) an&#13;
accurate and current baseline survey, (b) careful and comprehensive consultation with&#13;
local people and host communities, (c) restoration of living standard of local people, (d)&#13;
fill compensation for land and other assets including those of indigenous people held&#13;
under customary tenure, (e) support acceptable to affected persons during transitional&#13;
phase, and (f) an explicit strategy and plan for sustainable encroachment control. The&#13;
detailed plan documentation would confirm consistency with these best practices. Subject&#13;
to decisions to be taken during microplanning, village ecodevelopment investments in and&#13;
around the PAs may help to restore the living standards of local people. Subject to the&#13;
additional consultation, the special voluntary relocation program of the Ecodevelopment&#13;
Project might also provide additional financing for people living within the PAs. However,&#13;
such financing by the Ecodevelopment Project would be incidental, and would be directed&#13;
toward ecodevelopment objectives, not the needs of non-project investments. Agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               III                             Annex 7&#13;
initiating the non-project activities (e.g. irrigation department, electicity board), not the&#13;
state forest departments, would be responsible for the full costs of resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation associated with their investments.&#13;
17.   Liaison. The project would also support the incorporation of PA considerations&#13;
into regional planning on a more general and comprehensive level. Assessment and&#13;
mitigation of regional impacts and integration of PA concerns into regional development&#13;
plans requires good working relationships with local and regional planning and&#13;
management authorities and with local communities. These relationships can be based on a&#13;
clear formulation of local conservation needs and objectives that can in themselves usefully&#13;
contribute to the development of regional plans Such plans should attempt to set goals&#13;
and standards for the development and conservation of natural resources since these will&#13;
help to guarantee that the output of multiple land-use systems can be sustained without&#13;
foreclosing options for future use.&#13;
Ecosytem Protection and Habitats&#13;
18.   Protecting and Managing Ecosystems and Habitats. During project&#13;
preparation, the PA authorities developed an indicative list of activities based on existing&#13;
plans and available information. The scope and nature of these activities differ from PA to&#13;
PA and in most cases would be very site specific. The broad categories of activities are:&#13;
(a)   Ecosystem and habitat restoration&#13;
(b)   Improving fire, poaching, and animal control&#13;
(c)   Managing enterprise and visitor enclaves.&#13;
The updated PA management plans described above, once completed, would determine&#13;
the specific content of investments in this subcomponent. For each PA, the states would&#13;
submit the updated PA management plans for approval by the Bank prior to&#13;
implementation of the plan. However, investments in ecosystem protection and&#13;
management would be required prior to the likely completion of the PA management plan&#13;
updating..&#13;
Initial Investments&#13;
19.   Eligibility Criteria of Initial Investments. To ensure the environmental&#13;
soundness of such interim activities, PA officials would have to demonstrate first that the&#13;
activities would:&#13;
(a)   Conserve biodiversity&#13;
(b)   Be urgently needed&#13;
(c)   Not foreclose options being considered for the updated PA management&#13;
plans&#13;
(d)   Be consistent with existing PA management plans&#13;
(e)   Be technically feasible&#13;
(f)    Not erode customary tenure rights of tribals and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               112                             Annex 7&#13;
(g)   Be environmentally sustainable.&#13;
20.   Planning and Clearance Process for Early Investments in Protecting and&#13;
Managing Ecosystems. To accomplish the above, PA managers would follow the steps&#13;
listed below:&#13;
(a)   Preparation of annual operational work plan and endorsement of work plan&#13;
by PA Coordinating Committee&#13;
(b)   Review of annual work plans by PA director in collaboration with&#13;
contracted organizations to ensure activities meet the eligibility criteria&#13;
outlined above (although subject to further environmental and social&#13;
review)&#13;
(c)   Preparation of site plans, engineering specifications, layouts, etc. for each&#13;
activity, including a review of their environmental and social impact; and&#13;
review and approval of site plans and designs by the World Bank, as&#13;
appropriate&#13;
(d)   Implementation of activities according to workplan&#13;
(e)   Monitoring of progress, performance, and impact of PA management&#13;
activities in collaboration with contracted organizations&#13;
(f)   Incorporation of monitoring findings and interim status reports on PA&#13;
management plan updating into subsequent annual work plans.&#13;
Types of Investments&#13;
21.   Ecosystem and Habitat Restoration. The project would aim to restore and&#13;
maintain biodiversity in the PAs through well targeted and researched restoration works&#13;
and associated staff supervision aimed at improving the viability of habitats and&#13;
populations in the PAs and immediate surroundings. Although restoration technologies&#13;
cannot quickly restore the diversity that existed prior to degradation, they can break the&#13;
cycle of resource degradation and re-establish a community of indigenous organisms. In&#13;
the project PAs, existing restoration plans include eradication of weeds, improving&#13;
conditions for natural regeneration of food and fodder species, stabilizing and improving&#13;
conditions in areas prone to extensive soil erosion; and special control structures such as&#13;
electric fencing and stone walls to reduce grazing pressure on fragile areas from domestic&#13;
animals. Additional programs in indicative plans include the water conservation works in&#13;
areas where there is a serious shortage of water for endangered animals during the dry&#13;
seasons. The location and extent of the ecosystem and habitat restoration works would&#13;
evolve from the project-initiated PA management planning process. These interventions&#13;
would be site-specific and based on a careful consideration of alternatives and the need to&#13;
maintain or enhance ecosystem integrity of the PA.&#13;
22.   Fire, Poaching, and Animal Control. Effective conservation of PAs can only be&#13;
achieved by restricting or controlling activities that might have a detrimental impact on PA&#13;
resources. Investments would include communications equipment, a limited number of&#13;
vehicles and boats, minor access track improvements, fire watch towers, sign boards, and&#13;
boundary markers. Enhanced training on fire management would also be supported. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                     113                                  Annex 7&#13;
project would also encourage and support programs for enlisting the support of PA&#13;
neighbors in PA management related activities, including employment as guards and&#13;
watchers, anti-poaching squads, community protection groups, etc. Special animal control&#13;
measures including structures such as electric fencing and stone walls would help prevent&#13;
elephant straying out into the wider areas of human habitation surrounding Buxa, Palarnau&#13;
and Nagarhole. Site-specific animal damage control structures directed at villages in the&#13;
immediate periphery would also be supported under the ecodevelopment component of&#13;
the project.&#13;
Upgrading Amenities for PA Staff&#13;
23.    The selection of the seven PAs was premised in part on the fact that these PAs&#13;
already had good facilities and would not require extensive infrastructure improvements.&#13;
Nevertheless, some upgrading of the amenities for field staff would be required and would&#13;
comprise limited staff quarters for the lowest ranked PA staff, patrol camps, and drinking&#13;
water and electricity supplies for some locations. In addition, career development training&#13;
and field kits for staff would be supported under the project.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               117                             Annex 8&#13;
Annex 8: Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.    Village ecodevelopment would reduce negative interactions of local people on&#13;
biodiversity and increase collaboration of local people in conservation. Under this&#13;
component the project would:&#13;
(a)   Conduct participatory microplanning and provide implementation support,&#13;
using contracted local NGOs, expert advisors, workshops, materials,&#13;
training (of government officials, NGOs, and local people), PA staff, and&#13;
associated travel&#13;
(b)   Implement reciprocal commitments that foster alternative livelihoods and&#13;
resource uses to be financed by a village ecodevelopment program and that&#13;
specify measurable actions by local people to improve conservation&#13;
(c)   Conduct special programs to:&#13;
(i)   support additional joint forest management in reserve forests in the&#13;
immediate vicinity&#13;
(ii)   develop the voluntary relocation option for people in the PAs in&#13;
ways that are consistent with project objectives and Bank policies&#13;
(See Annex 20) and&#13;
(iii)  provide other supplemental investments through a discretionary&#13;
reserve for PA managers to allocate to areas with special needs.&#13;
B. Participatory Microplanning and Implementation Processes&#13;
2.    Microplanning support teams composed of PA personnel, collaborating NGOs and&#13;
villagers (each team with at least one woman and with members able to easily&#13;
communicate with tribals) would assist village communities to develop and implement&#13;
site-specific reciprocal plans on a continuing basis throughout the project period. In order&#13;
to ensure that these plans meet project objectives and embody the active commitment and&#13;
participation of local people, focused guidelines, clearly determined investment criteria,&#13;
supportive training programs and carefully scheduled planning would be critical. Since this&#13;
form of rolling, participatory planning represents a radical departure from current project&#13;
practices, it would require sustained support throughout project implementation.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
3.    Key Elements. The project would develop and employ methodologies best suited&#13;
to village ecodevelopment through:&#13;
Guidelines subject to revision to reflect experience in practice. Revision will be documented through&#13;
exchanges of letters and comprehensive updating as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  118                                Annex 8&#13;
(a)    active participation of all segments of society in plan formulation and&#13;
decision-making through a community institutional framework that elicits&#13;
the widest possible consensus.&#13;
(b)    participatory rural appraisal (PRA) focused on the mutual interactions&#13;
and reciprocal arrangements between the PA and people;&#13;
(c)    simplified microplan format allowing the village group to be the author&#13;
of the plans jointly with the PA authorities, directly incorporating the&#13;
results of the focused PRA exercises, and summarizing the mutually&#13;
approved investments, objectives, inputs, mutual obligations, schedule, and&#13;
monitoring indicators that together form the reciprocal commitments;&#13;
(d)    arrangements for cost and benefit sharing within all reciprocal&#13;
commitments,&#13;
(e)    assessments of proposals to determine whether they meet eligibility and&#13;
feasibility criteria for project investment, and to incorporate lessons from&#13;
ongoing monitoring;&#13;
(f)    administrative arrangements to simplify and speed fund allocations and&#13;
community-led implementation&#13;
(g)    community and support team capacity built through on-going training&#13;
and study tours.&#13;
4.     Further Development of Methodology. Many elements of this methodology have&#13;
already been developed during the preparation process. A national level NGO would be&#13;
contracted to further refine these elements to meet project needs. This refinement would&#13;
be done in collaboration with local NGOs, project staff, and trainers, and would also&#13;
produce guidelines for local adaptation and use in the field and for incorporation into&#13;
training programs.&#13;
Village Institutions and Marginal Sub-groups&#13;
5.    Group Size and Composition. The project would operate at the level of a single&#13;
village or hamlet constituted into an ecodevelopment committee (EDC), except where&#13;
existing forest protection committees have already been established for joint forest&#13;
management (JFM). This design reflects well-documented lessons from participatory&#13;
.forestry programs in India (such as JFM) and elsewhere identifying appropriate village&#13;
institutions as the best units for microplanning and as the basis for community action. In&#13;
general, the best results have been obtained from relatively small and homogeneous&#13;
villages, hamlets, and user groups (i.e., 30-60 households) in which all households are&#13;
represented in the decision-making body by both men and women members of the&#13;
2&#13;
household . Frequently, informal groups that are smaller than the revenue village and&#13;
2&#13;
In several cases, in the interest of minimizing administrative complications, forestry officials have&#13;
included projections for larger groups when compiling cost estimates for the project. However, the&#13;
project review would include close monitoring on the extent of marginal peoples' participation in&#13;
these groups and group size would be reduced if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               119                             Annex 8&#13;
separate, though inclusive of, the political panchayat bodies have proven the most&#13;
effective and sustainable units for joint forest management and community based rural&#13;
development. The formation of groups should reduce herogenity within, thus enabling the&#13;
representative to speak for the entire group, while encouraging heterogenity between&#13;
groups negotiation and conflict resolution to take place between groups. However, equity&#13;
considerations require that ecodevelopment committees are composed of all members of&#13;
the village/hamlet and include women representatives from each household as well as men.&#13;
6.    Inclusion of Marginal Sub-groups. Many villages contain sub-groups that&#13;
differentiate resource use and income strategies by both social and economic status and by&#13;
gender. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) microplanning exercises will need to make&#13;
special efforts to ensure that less vocal and powerful sub-groups fully participate. Course&#13;
reference material collected by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), documents one of the&#13;
most effective means of ensuring this participation. This is to hold separate exercises with&#13;
each identified sub-group and then discuss the results in a general assembly meeting. This&#13;
ensures that discussions with different ethnic and social groups are conducted in ways that&#13;
are sensitive to their cultural norms.&#13;
Government Orders&#13;
7.    Relation to Joint Forest Management. New government orders (GOs) would be&#13;
required to establish the EDCs and enable them to implement village ecodevelopment&#13;
activities and share in project benefits, including forest resources. Many, but not all, of the&#13;
states have issued GOs allowing joint forest management (JFM) on reserve and protected&#13;
forests. These specify membership, rights and responsibilities, and benefit sharing&#13;
arrangements for various products such as grass, non-timber forest products (NTFP),&#13;
poles and timber. Where these arrangements are in place, they would automatically apply&#13;
to JFM activities in peripheral reserve forest areas. JFM activities are widely expected to&#13;
be the most effective ecodevelopment investment available to the project. Where GOs are&#13;
not yet issued, it is critical that they be so, to allow JFM to be instituted around PAs..&#13;
8.    EDC Government Orders. The project has stressed the need for the states to&#13;
develop GO to establish ecodevelopment committees and define their rights and&#13;
responsibilities. While initial village ecodevelopment investments can proceed without a&#13;
formal legal framework, for large-scale implementation of the village ecodevelopment&#13;
states will need to have an appropriate GO consistent with project design. The orders&#13;
would need to address the strategy of mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable groups,&#13;
by providing for such measures as resource-sharing from operations. Such operations&#13;
would include habitat manipulation; other such sources would be tourist entry fees,&#13;
confiscated produce etc.&#13;
9.    Status of Government Orders. All participating states have drafted GOs on&#13;
establishing EDCs.. Assurances would be sought that states would issue these GOs by&#13;
September 30, 1998. Although the specification of benefit sharing from PA areas is&#13;
severely constrained by existing legislation, most PA managers are of the opinion that it is&#13;
possible to come to specific agreements with EDCs regarding distribution of benefits from&#13;
PA operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

10.   Minimum Required Contents of Government Orders. These orders would&#13;
follow the pattern of GOs for JFM committees, with suitable modifications to comply with&#13;
the laws governing national parks and sanctuaries. At the very least they must) specify the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   Composition of the EDC in each village would comprise all eligible&#13;
households including those headed by women, all scheduled castes(SCs),&#13;
and all scheduled tribes (STs). Women would have equal rights with male&#13;
household members. Women and STs/SCs would be included on the&#13;
executive committee; a mechanism for registering members with the forest&#13;
department would be established and a bank account, to be jointly&#13;
operated, would be authorized&#13;
(b)   Rights and responsibilities of the EDC members and the forest department&#13;
to protect the PA and carry out ecodevelopment activities would be&#13;
established&#13;
(c)   Provisions would be made for sharing of revenues or produce from&#13;
specified operations such as habitat manipulation (e.g. fire line grass and&#13;
brush cutting, elimination of undesirable species, etc.), tourism revenues,&#13;
confiscated produce, and so forth&#13;
(d)   Provisions would be made for conflict resolution and revocation of&#13;
agreement.&#13;
Protected Area Mutual Interactions Assessment&#13;
11.   Focused Assessment. Sustained focus on PA relationships is necessary if PRA&#13;
exercises are to lead to reciprocal commitments that meet project objectives rather than&#13;
leading off into general rural development. This would require the use of what the Aga&#13;
Khan Rural Support Program calls a "Topical PRA", which is centered on the analysis of&#13;
interaction between the PA and local people. Such a PRA could be termed a protected&#13;
area mutual interactions assessment (PAMIA). Its constant object would be to mediate&#13;
disagreements and find mutually agreed solutions, either by directly decreasing the source&#13;
of disagreement or by finding compensatory mechanisms. (See Box I for a list of possible&#13;
PRA tools to carry out this planning.) The strength of a PRA comes in part from its&#13;
holistic analysis of problems, needs, and opportunities and their inter-linkages. But both&#13;
PA authorities and village communities must agree that any proposed investment or action&#13;
will result in measurable improvement to sustainable biodiversity conservation. Other&#13;
issues in community development are only relevant if they contribute to project objectives;&#13;
they can be eliminated from PRA and microplanning exercises unless identified by the&#13;
community as their highest priority for helping to conserve the PA. This focused approach&#13;
reduces the amount of time and resources required to extend PRA based microplanning to&#13;
each of the proposed EDCs as well as increasing the potential for sustained mutual&#13;
cooperation.&#13;

12.   Assessment Process. Following the establishment of EDCs, team training, and the&#13;
collection of background materials and maps, the microplanning teams would conduct&#13;
PAMIAs through a series of village meetings. At the outset of the microplanning process,&#13;
the teams would need to make a clear presentation of the project conditions for&#13;
ecodevelopment investment proposals. These would include the fixed amount determined&#13;
by the number of households; the necessity for village contributions and procedures for&#13;
making them; the nature of the reciprocal commitment that is the microplanning outcome,&#13;
and the feasibility criteria that all eligible investments must meet. Clear and widespread&#13;
understanding of the objectives, benefits and constraints of project investments will help&#13;
focus PAMIA discussions and ensure that they lead to reciprocal commitments of mutual&#13;
benefit.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria for Investments&#13;
13.   To be eligible for inclusion in the reciprocal commitments, village ecodevelopment&#13;
investments would have to follow specific eligibility criteria listed below:c&#13;
(a)    Conserve biodiversity either directly or indirectly by creating sufficient&#13;
incentives for a consensus to commit local people to specific, measurable,&#13;
actions that improve conservation&#13;
(b)   Provide equitable share of benefits to and mitigate negative impacts&#13;
on tribals, women, and poor disadvantaged groups who are currently most&#13;
dependent on the PA&#13;
(c)   Add supplemental resources, Le, alternative sources of funding and&#13;
support are not available&#13;
(d)   Be socially and institutionally feasible, ensuring that, e.g., associated&#13;
activities are culturally acceptable and that local institutional capacity is&#13;
adequate to organize rotating forest protection, distribute benefits from&#13;
common resources, provide physical maintenance, keep accounts, meet&#13;
contribution requirements, etc.&#13;
(e)    Be financially feasible, e.g. , costs are within norms or cleared by PA&#13;
manager; returns are sufficient to compensate for PA resources foregone,&#13;
and, for all investments intended to produce cash revenue or benefits that&#13;
can be monetized, market linkages are adequate, cash flow requirements&#13;
are viable, and returns compare favorably with alternative investment&#13;
options&#13;
(f)    Be technically feasible, e.g., inputs and technical advice are adequate;&#13;
physical conditions are suitable; activity is technically sound&#13;
(g)   Be environmental sustainable: confirm that, e.g., adverse environmental&#13;
impact of exotic species, agro-chemicals, construction activity, can be&#13;
ameliorated or avoided&#13;
(h)   Be selected and owned by EDCs; ensured through by budget constraint&#13;
mechanism and contribution requirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               123                              Annex 8&#13;
14.   Eligibility Review. Local EDCs and PA project managers would both be&#13;
responsible for applying eligibility criteria to proposed ecodevelopment investments. Local&#13;
people would assess these criteria using their fund of indigenous knowledge and local&#13;
experience, but would have access to expert advice where necessary. Project managers&#13;
and microplanning teams would also supplement their existing knowledge with expert&#13;
assessments and the results of ongoing monitoring and research. The project managers&#13;
would then be responsible for ensuring that the microplan proposals forwarded to them&#13;
meet these criteria before authorizing their implementation by completing a reciprocal&#13;
ecodevelopment agreement with each village community. It would be impractical and&#13;
exorbitantly expensive to have outside experts assess each microplan- Therefore,&#13;
consultant experts in each technical, economic, and social subject likely to be at issue&#13;
would be engaged to examine the range of potential investments and create specific&#13;
guidelines for the appraisal of microplan investment. In many cases, such information is&#13;
already available with specialized government departments, universities, and NGOs and&#13;
need only be duplicated and summarized for use of project authorities. However, many&#13;
special cases are likely to arise during the course of the project that may require some on-&#13;
going expert input. In addition, project managers would be responsible for regularly&#13;
disseminating the results of ongoing monitoring and research to all PA staff and&#13;
ecodevelopment committees for discussion and incorporation into their planning and&#13;
implementation activities.&#13;
15.   Actions that Improve Conservation. EDCs would specify their commitment in&#13;
advance of the investment, but the commitment could be for actions that would usually&#13;
begin upon the completion of the investment. Examples of specific measurable actions&#13;
include avoidance of grazing or fuelwood collection or NTFP collection in a specified&#13;
area, operation of a regular village patrol, arrangements to assist in poaching control, etc.&#13;
It would be important for the commitments to be realistic and to be based on a full&#13;
consensus of the EDC.&#13;
16.   Feasibility Considerations. Project preparation included the development of&#13;
generic cross-sectoral feasibility guidelines and examples of sector-specific guidelines.&#13;
Both the project preparation facility (PPF) and the project include support for&#13;
development of additional sector-specific guidelines and ongoing revision of existing&#13;
guidelines based on project experience. Ecodevelopment investments would be restricted&#13;
to types of investments that were already covered by sector-specific feasibility guidelines&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Part C of this Annex lists questions directed to the EDCs on generic&#13;
considerations for all investments, and Part D provides an example of sector-specific&#13;
questions.&#13;
17.   Acceptability of Investment Costs. Proposed investment costs for all projects&#13;
selected by EDCs would be required to fit within state norms unless granted a waiver by&#13;
the PA director. EDCs would select investments within a pre-established budget and with&#13;
implicit consideration of relative costs.&#13;
18.   Budget Constraints: Level and Phasing. The total costs of the ecodevelopment&#13;
investments would not exceed Rs. 10,000 (US $285) in constant 1996 prices per family,&#13;
plus Rs. 500 (US$14) per family at preinvestment (i.e., during initial microplanning) to&#13;
establish credibility. The funding would usually be spread out over a three year period,&#13;
with one third of the total resources available each year. The budget constraint per EDC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               124                              Annex 8&#13;
would be calculated on a per household basis, multiplied by the total number of&#13;
households. For example, a forty-family hamlet would make decisions within a binding&#13;
budget constraint of Rs. 133,333 (US$3.800) for the first year, or Rs. 400,000&#13;
(US$11,400) over the three years.&#13;
19.   Basis for Determining Budget Constraints. The participatory rural appraisal&#13;
exercises during project preparation provided the basis for determining an appropriate&#13;
level for the budget constraint. First, this level would provide sufficient incentive for local&#13;
people to commit to reciprocal commitments. Second, it would require that local people&#13;
use the budget constraint to help determine their investment priorities and ensure financial&#13;
and economic viability. Budget data on unit costs of possible investments would provide&#13;
useful information for local communities, allowing them to be fully aware of relative costs&#13;
in determining their priority investments in relation to the budget constraint.&#13;
20.   Use of Budget Constraint. Evidence that the community has allocated investment&#13;
funds on the basis of a budget constraint would include data on:&#13;
(a)   The number of households,&#13;
(b)   The standard budget constraint multiplier (including adjustment for&#13;
inflation)&#13;
(c)   The standard budget constraint for the EDC&#13;
(d)   The provision of additional funds from the discretionary reserve and&#13;
justification (description of special needs) of this supplemental allocation&#13;
(see paragraph 67 below)&#13;
(e)   The total value of all desirable investments, which presumably would&#13;
exceed the budget constraint, and the unit costs and quantities used to&#13;
calculate this total value&#13;
(f)    The list with quanitities, unit costs, and value of the proposed investments&#13;
(of which the total would not exceed "c" plus "d").&#13;
It would also include a brief description of the decision making process (e.g., how many&#13;
meetings? who participated?) and the important factors (e.g., unit cost of investment&#13;
option relative to size of projected benefit?, total number of beneficiaries affected by&#13;
investment option?, extent of forest dependence of beneficiaries?) that the community&#13;
used to decide how to reduce the list of investments to fit within the constraint.&#13;
Contributions of Local People&#13;
21.   Overview. The project design specifies that local people contribute at least 25&#13;
percent of the total village ecodevelopment investment in cash, kind, or labor, and that&#13;
payment for the market value of contributions be made available to the local people for&#13;
additional community investments&#13;
22.   Contributions Required Only for Regular Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
Investments. The requirement for local people to contribute to investment costs applies&#13;
only to the regular village ecodevelopment investments. It does not apply to improved PA&#13;
management activities, planning and implementation support for the village&#13;
ecodevelopment program, research/impact monitoring and environmental education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                125                               Annex 8&#13;
activities, project preparation, nor to the project management activities. The requirement&#13;
would not necessarily apply to the special programs for the periphery, although some of&#13;
these programs (e.g. participatory forestry) also involve arrangements for local&#13;
contributions.&#13;
23.   Reasons for Requirement. One of the most important eligibility criteria of village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments in the main program is that they "conserve biodiversity by ....&#13;
creating sufficient incentives for a consensus that commits people to specific, measurable&#13;
actions that improve conservation." The local people will need to believe that they will&#13;
directly benefit from and own the investment to be willing to commit to such actions. The&#13;
history of rural and urban development investments has shown that where the objective of&#13;
an investment is to benefit local people (including the poorest of the poor), it is essential&#13;
to require some form of cost sharing. Without cost sharing, such investments are highly&#13;
likely to fail. If the village ecodevelopment investments fail, local people will not continue&#13;
to commit to the actions that improve conservation.&#13;
24.   Contribution Requirements. Accordingly contribution requirements would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    Local people would provide a minimum of 25 percent of the total&#13;
investment costs for all regular village ecodevelopment investments,&#13;
including community oriented activities&#13;
(b)   For investments that benefit individuals, local people would provide a&#13;
minimum of 25 percent of the investment costs or the established state&#13;
government norms for that type of investment, whichever is higher;&#13;
(c)    For investments that take place over several years (e.g.. joint forest&#13;
management) the minimum cost sharing in any one yeai would be at least&#13;
15 percent of that year's investment costs, with arrangements to ensure 25&#13;
percent cost sharing over the total investment period&#13;
(d)   Local cost sharing would consist of direct contributions of cash, labor, or&#13;
physical resources; arrangements for the Forest Department to provide a&#13;
cash advance or credit would not fulfill cost sharing requirement&#13;
(e)    The total investment cost would be calculated as the sum of all resources,&#13;
cash and non-cash; the value of labor and other in-kind contributions would&#13;
be calculated on the basis of local market value&#13;
(f)   In order to ensure that cost sharing influences the choice of the specific&#13;
investment, such sharing would be based on directly related investment&#13;
costs. Implied labor costs of local people participating in microplanning,&#13;
and opportunity costs of resources that have been foregone due to the&#13;
establishment of the PA would not be eligible).&#13;
25.   Simplified Calculations. The above specifications are designed to minimize&#13;
administrative complexities. Therefore, a formula that changes over time or costs of items&#13;
whose value is difficult to measure are not included.&#13;
26.   Reinvestment of Contribution. The project funds would provide the value of the&#13;
25 percent contribution through a community investment fund of the village&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                   126                                 Annex 8&#13;
ecodevelopment committee. This fund would be used for community investments in&#13;
accordance with participatory microplanning procedures, incorporating the agreed&#13;
reciprocal commitments needed to meet project objectives. This arrangement would thus&#13;
help to extend the incentive mechanism beyond the period of the initial project investment.&#13;

PRA Record Keeping and Microplan Proposals/Ecodevelopment&#13;
Agreements&#13;
27.   Documentation of Background Analysis. The results of PRA exercises need to&#13;
be transferred to paper and ample copies provided to the EDC and the officials concerned&#13;
with project implementation, These officials would include forest guards, foresters, range&#13;
officers, and those involved in project management. The documents---whether in the form&#13;
of maps, lists, diagrams, or discussion minutes (including answers to feasibility questions)-&#13;
--can serve as the background information to the microplan proposals. They can also&#13;
substitute for the lengthy data collection exercises sometimes required at present. They&#13;
would be written in a language that is readily understood by the local people. As the direct&#13;
product of village deliberations, they are "owned" by the village. They can also serve as a&#13;
powerful tool for participatory monitoring of project progress.&#13;
28.    Format. The format of the microplan proposal itself can be relatively simple. Once&#13;
approved by signature of PA authorities and all members of the EDC, this proposal can&#13;
become the ecodevelopment agreement that is the basis for activity implementation. Box 2&#13;

Objectives, including biodiversity (stop grazing in certain areas, reduce incidence of fire&#13;
by 50 percent, reduce green fuelwood collection by 90 percent, etc.), socioeconomic (10&#13;
percent increased income from milk sales for 20 households, 25 percent reduction in crop&#13;
depredation by wild boars, better relations between people and forest department staff,&#13;
etc.)&#13;
Indicators of success (e.g. increased herbivore population in PA, increased regeneration&#13;
of species that are not fire-tolerant, increased yields from fields subject to crop&#13;
depredation, increased milk production, more positive park staff - people interactions,&#13;
etc.) agreed assessment measures (may be based on group observations and reporting&#13;
rather than scientific)&#13;
Inputs and activities to be provided by project and village group, including cost sharing&#13;
and project financing requirements (which inter alia, demonstrate that investments fit&#13;
within budget constraint, applicable cost norms, and meet contribution requirements);&#13;
Benefit distribution &amp; access to resources, including how expected benefits will be&#13;
distributed and the resource using rights and concessions of participants (e.g., grass&#13;
collection and distribution arrangements, access to NTFP products, water distribution&#13;
arrangements, etc.)&#13;
Other mutual obligations and responsibilities, including on-going decision making&#13;
(e.g., responsibility to stop grazing or green fuelwood collection, responsibility for&#13;
organizing community protection, responsibility to pay prompt livestock compensation,&#13;
responsibility to prevent outsider timber smuggling, responsibility to allow EDC to deal&#13;
with minor offenses, mechanism to deal with conflicts and plan revisions, etc.);&#13;
Community organizations and individuals responsible for implementation would be clearly&#13;

would also be specified,&#13;
Work schedule, including schedule for delivery of inputs and implementation, schedule&#13;
for review meetings, etc.,&#13;

30.   Logistic Complexities. Orchestrating personnel and resource needs for carrying&#13;
out the extensive microplanning and village ecodevelopment investment program will be a&#13;
complex endeavor. The average PA is planning to target approximately 60,000 people&#13;
consisting of an average of about 10,000 households in villages varying in size from less&#13;
than 30 households to more than 200. At full project development, microplanning&#13;
activities will often be going on in at least 20 - 40 villages and, simultaneously in each PA,&#13;
implementation support in 50 - 200 villages. Two to four microplanning and&#13;
implementation support teams per PA in addition to forestry staff assigned to each EDC&#13;
will be required to carry out project activities. Extensive personnel planning and training&#13;
of these staff has been built into the project. This is designed to ensure that there will be&#13;
enough time and resources to nurture true participation and avoid the temptation to group&#13;
separate villages into larger and more diverse units for ease of administration. To do this&#13;
would probably defeat the purpose of this part of the project by discouraging&#13;
participation.&#13;
31.   Support Teams. Composition of planning and implementation support teams will&#13;
vary by PA. In general, a senior PA officer (e.g., ecodevelopment officer, deputy director,&#13;
attached officer) will provide overall guidance and supervision with the assistance of the&#13;
contracted sociologist and ecologist. Two to four teams composed of assigned range&#13;
officers and contracted NGOs will conduct microplanning and form microplanning teams&#13;
for each EDC with the addition of the locally assigned forester and forest guard as well as&#13;
some members of the EDC selected by the village. In general, PAs plan to form separate&#13;
implementation support teams with PA personnel and NGOs, although there will probably&#13;
be overlap between these two sets of teams. during both microplanning and&#13;
implementation, provision has been made to enlist additional specialized technical&#13;
expertise from local government departments and private firms.&#13;
32.   NGO Support. Through contractual arrangements with each state's project&#13;
authorities, NGOs would provide personnel and expertise in participatory approaches to&#13;
support the microplanning and implementation teams (see section G below for terms of&#13;
reference).&#13;
C. Generic Feasibility and Eligibility Considerations for All Investments&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
33.   The following list of questions would be used by EDCs and by those responsible&#13;
for reviewing reciprocal commitments for compliance with the eligibility criteria and the&#13;
village ecodevelopment investment for feasibility:&#13;
34.   Direct or Indirect Linkage&#13;
(a)   Does the proposed activity directly lead to increased biodiversity&#13;
conservation? If the biodiversity of the region were to be seriously&#13;
degraded, would the proposed enterprise fail?&#13;
(b)   If linkage to conservation is not direct, does investment provide adequate&#13;
incentives for changes to specific behaviors that threaten the biodiversity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               130                             Annex 8&#13;
the adjacent PA? Is there widespread agreement on specific measures to&#13;
increase conservation as a result of indirect benefits&#13;
35.   Agreement.&#13;
(a)   What measurable improvements in interactions with the PA will result from&#13;
this activity or investment?&#13;

most from the proposed (or already instituted) changes in traditional PA&#13;
resource use?&#13;
(b)   How have population currently dependent on the PA, especially tribals,&#13;
women, and other disadvantaged people participated in discussions and the&#13;
decision making process?&#13;
(c)   What provisions would ensure that the concerns of marginal groups such as&#13;
tribals, women, and other disadvantaged groups are specifically addressed?&#13;
(d)   How would these provisions be monitored?&#13;

Additionality&#13;
39.   Existing Program Options. What existing schemes and programs from&#13;
government agencies and private programs might potentially support the proposed&#13;
activity?&#13;
40.   Access. How could the ecodevelopment support team help with access these&#13;
programs as either an alternative or supplement to funding from the Ecodevelopment&#13;
Project? Are there specific constraints to accessing these programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

enterprise? Do they have prior experience in operating an enterprise of this&#13;
type?&#13;
(b)   If there are no members of the community who have experience in this type&#13;
of enterprise, who would provide the short-term expertise and training?&#13;
What steps are needed to provide the essential support?&#13;
(c)   Can the group organize essential activities and provide physical&#13;
maintenance (e.g., rotating responsibilities for forest protection,&#13;
maintaining small scale irrigation or check dam)? What are the proposed&#13;
arrangements?&#13;
(d)   What are the arrangements for financial administration? Who would keep&#13;
group accounts? Are there appropriate procedures and accounting systems&#13;
for handling funds, including payments for the market value of&#13;
contributions that may be made available for additional community&#13;
investments?&#13;
(e)   What are the arrangements for monitoring and reporting on implementation&#13;
progress?&#13;
43.   Enterprise Participants&#13;
(a)   Who are the individuals who would be either employed by the operation or&#13;
supplying raw materials to the operation?&#13;
(b)   Who would have ownership of the enterprise? Who would make the&#13;
decisions? What form would this ownership take?&#13;
(c)   What are the arrangements to distribute benefits from common resources?&#13;
44.   Contribution Requirement&#13;

Financial Feasibility&#13;
45.   Village groups would consider the full range of financial feasibility issues for all&#13;
those investments intended to produce cash revenue or to produce subsistence benefits&#13;
with a value that can be converted to a monetary equivalent. For investments that would&#13;
not produce quantifiable benefits, village groups would consider financial issues related to&#13;
the basic overview, costs, funding, and conclusions but would not consider market&#13;
opportunity, competition, and profit/loss.&#13;
46.   Basic Overview of Investment.&#13;
(a)    What is the specific product or service to be offered?&#13;
(b)    How would the product or service be produced?&#13;
47.   Market Opportunity&#13;
(a)    Who would be the intended customers?&#13;
(b)    What is the history of the intended market?&#13;
(c)    Why would customers buy this product or service? What gap(s) in the&#13;
marketplace would it fill? Does the opportunity exist because there is&#13;
excess demand and insufficient supply? Could it be sold at lower cost than&#13;
others? Would it be of higher quality than that offered by others?&#13;
(d)    How much of the product or service would customers buy?&#13;
(e)    What prices would intended customers be willing to pay? How were the&#13;
estimated prices determined?&#13;
48.   Competition&#13;
(a)    Is there any competition for this product or service? Who are these&#13;
competitors? Are they selling the same product, or a close substitute?&#13;
(b)    What advantage would this enterprise have over the competition? Why?&#13;
(c)    Would the advantage be sustainable over the long term?&#13;
6&#13;
49.   Variable Costs&#13;
(a)    What items (e.g., labor, materials, energy) contribute to the variable cost?&#13;
How much for each item?&#13;
(b)    What would be the total variable cost of the good or service offered?&#13;
For example, alternative fuel sources and village water supplies can produce benefits that can be&#13;
converted to a monetary equivalent by calculating the income women could potentially earn in the&#13;
time they save by having fuel or water nearby. Such benefits may vary throughout the year depending&#13;
on the seasonal demand for labor. Investments to prevent crop and livestock depredation would have&#13;
benefits calculated by the value of crop or livestock multiplied by the reduction in risk resulting from&#13;
the investment.&#13;
6&#13;
Costs that vary directly and proportionately with volume.&#13;

50.    Fixed Costs&#13;
(a)    What are the types and amounts of investment required at the start of the&#13;
program?&#13;
(b)    Does the investment cost fit within the state norms? If not, has the PA&#13;
director granted a waiver?&#13;
(c)    What are the administration costs of the enterprise?&#13;
(d)    What are the costs of enterprise facilities (e.g., land, office space, etc.)?&#13;
8&#13;
(e)    What are the annual replacement costs of equipment and vehicles?&#13;
51.    Profit/Loss Projections and Cash Flow&#13;
(a)    Develop a worksheet that shows combined cash and non-cash profits and&#13;
losses of the business over five years&#13;
(b)    Develop a worksheet that shows expected cash receipts and expenditures&#13;
over five years&#13;
(c)    Analyze the distribution of costs and benefits to the individuals&#13;
participating in the enterprise.&#13;
52.    Funding&#13;
(a)    What are the sources of funds?&#13;
(b)    How will the community provide funds and manage operation and&#13;
maintenance after the investment phase has been completed?&#13;
(c)    Will the project create cash-flow problems for participants during the&#13;
investment period, before revenues are generated (a particular problem&#13;
with forest plantations)?&#13;
53.    Conclusions&#13;
(a)    Is the proposed investment financially viable?&#13;
(b)    Will it provide sufficient returns to ensure local commitment to&#13;
ecodevelopment agreement?&#13;
(c)    Are there alternative investments that would have a greater impact on the&#13;
local community?&#13;
Costs that do not vary directly with volume (e.g., administration and management costs,&#13;
communications costs, marketing costs, equipment).&#13;
Calculated by taking the initial value of the equipment and dividing by the expected number of years&#13;
of use.&#13;

Technical Feasibility&#13;
54.   Is proposed activity technically feasible? Does it use the best (e.g., cost effective,&#13;
locally suitable, etc.) technical alternative available?&#13;
55.   Are there existing government or private schemes that can provide the technical&#13;
assistance and inputs needed?&#13;
Environmental Feasibility&#13;
56.   Are there adverse environmental impacts? If so, what are the options and costs of&#13;
mitigation?&#13;
9&#13;
D. Sector Specific Feasibility (selected examples for illustration only)&#13;
57.   PPF and project financing would support development of comprehensive checklists&#13;
for a greater range of investments. These lists would cover additional considerations for&#13;
soil conservation, small irrigation, water supply, fuelwood alternatives, livestock&#13;
improvement, ecotourism, and crop and livestock protection structures.&#13;
Joint Forest Management.&#13;
58.   Government Resolution.&#13;
(a)   Has the state government issued a resolution detailing the institutional&#13;
arrangement for JFM and established guidelines for the sharing of&#13;
responsibilities and benefits between people and government agencies?&#13;
(b)   Has a plan been prepared to bring the peripheral forest areas under JFM,&#13;
giving the area to be covered and benefits expected from the efforts?&#13;
59.   Stock Map. Has a stock map of your proposed 1FM area and surroundings been&#13;
prepared, demarcating the following sections:&#13;
(a)    Area outside core PA of dense forest with overhead canopy exceeding 40&#13;
percent canopy closure&#13;
(b)   Area outside core PA of degraded forest with 10-40 percent canopy cover&#13;
and/or live stumps of overhead species of at least 250 per ha&#13;
(c)   Area outside core PA of blank areas, i.e., the areas with less than 10&#13;
percent cover and/or less than 250 live stumps of the overhead species&#13;
(d)   PA areas in the vicinity of village and JFM area where harvesting and other&#13;
resource use is prohibited or restricted.&#13;
60.   Dense Forest Area.&#13;
(a)   Is a uniform system, a selection system, or a coppice system planned?&#13;
(b)   How will the proposed system parameters minimize&#13;
9&#13;
PPF and project financing would support development of comprehensive checklists for a greater&#13;

regenerate?&#13;
(e)    What are the plans to survey regeneration at regular intervals to monitor&#13;
progress? What are the plans to provide sample plots to measure the&#13;
growth statistics? What provisions are there to modify the treatment and&#13;
harvesting plan if desired regeneration does not materialize?&#13;
(f)    What are the plans to maintain proper forest hygiene, e.g., climber cutting,&#13;
removal of dead and dying and pest-affected trees?&#13;
(g)    Are NTFP harvest methods and levels sustainable? How do they take into&#13;
account requirements of pollination, regeneration, seed dispersers, seed&#13;
predators, and plant health? How will NTFP collection be regulated to&#13;
ensure that it remains sustainable?&#13;
61.   Degraded Area&#13;
(a)    What are the plans to naturally regenerate these areas? Are the species&#13;
present coppicable?&#13;
(b)    What are the plans to close the area initially for a specific period to&#13;
collection of forest products and grazing?&#13;
(c)    What are the plans for fire prevention fire and protection against vandalism&#13;
and theft?&#13;
(d)   What are the plans for removing dead and dying trees and stumps and thin&#13;

62.   Blank Areas.&#13;
(a)    When selecting species, has appropriate vegetation in the successional scale&#13;
been selected, keeping in view the altered micro climate of the degraded&#13;
area? (For afforestation areas, a common mistake is to select those species&#13;
for planting that occur in the contiguous undegraded dense areas.&#13;
Degraded areas, however may only be suitable for vegetation that preceded&#13;
the current ones in the successional scale. For example, in an area with sal&#13;
as a crop in the dense section, the contiguous afforestation sites may have&#13;
to be planted with semul, sissoo, etc. instead of sal.)&#13;
(b)    Have exotics have been proved to be environmentally benign before&#13;
planting?&#13;
(c)    What are the arrangements for avoiding monoculture and preserving&#13;
existing biodiversity values?&#13;
(d)   What are the plans for collecting seeds from good phenotypes?&#13;
(Afforestation work should not be started unless good seeds are assured).&#13;
(e)    What are the plans for soil and moisture conservation, (e.g., contour&#13;
planting of shrubs and/or preparing contour V ditches and planting in&#13;
ditches)?&#13;
(f)   In areas that are sources of perennial streams, does the plantation model&#13;
include an adequate amount of ground flora (shrubs and grasses) to reduce&#13;
soil erosion without significantly reducing the lean period stream flow?&#13;
(g)    Are there plans for production of intermediate products and intercropping&#13;
of shrubs, grasses, and/or bamboo? If so, have tree densities been set&#13;
accordingly? (The tree density in such areas should not exceed 300&#13;
trees/ha)&#13;
(h)    What are the plans for weeding, fire watching, and controlled grazing for&#13;
the first three years?&#13;
63.   PA Area. Has the annual loss of harvests foregone by community members been&#13;
quantified? (The only harvesting allowed in core areas of PAs is that which would improve&#13;
the biodiversity status of these areas.) What measures have been taken to ensure there is&#13;
no collection of NTFP in core conservation areas within the PA?&#13;

Farm Forestry.&#13;
64.   Planting system.&#13;
(a)   Will the planting be peripheral (in lines around the agricultural field), block&#13;
(solid tree planting in agricultural waste or fallow land), or alley cropping&#13;
(growing agricultural crops between shrubs or trees)?&#13;
65.   Peripheral Planting&#13;
(a)   Do selected species have deeper root systems, lighter crowns, and&#13;
relatively low water demand? (These features minimize loss of agricultural&#13;
production brought about by peripheral plants through their shade effect&#13;
and use of surface soil water. The cultivation of such trees does not&#13;
significantly affect the water table). Has traditional knowledge available&#13;
within the community been consulted as to species selection that would&#13;
address the local water situation?&#13;
(b)   Are the selected species relatively fast-growing so that they can be&#13;
harvested quickly? Is there a good market for the smaller timber sizes of&#13;
the selected trees. (If trees can only be sold in large timber size, the tree&#13;
will have to grown over a longer period and the tree shade and root system&#13;
will cover a larger space, which would negatively impact agricultural&#13;
production).&#13;
(c)   Has monoculture been avoided by the planting of more than one species?&#13;
(This would reduce the chances of tree pest attack.)&#13;
66.   Block Planting&#13;
(a)   Has at least a two-tier species mix been selected, with both the higher and&#13;
lower layers having market or subsistence value?&#13;
(b)   Do plans for planting density vary according to the planned final products?&#13;
67.   Alley Cropping&#13;
(a)   Have places where there is drought stress been avoided?&#13;
(b)   Have you focused on leguminous or other nitrogen-fixing species?&#13;
(c)   Does the tree/shrub and agricultural crop mixture have a complementary&#13;
physiological relationship?&#13;
(d)   What are the plans to prune the woody crop at interval to keep its shade&#13;
effect to a minimum?&#13;
68.   Nurseries&#13;
(a)   Is there a good source of high quality seeds or seedlings? Have an adequate&#13;
number of nurseries to supply the seedlings of desired species to the&#13;
farmers been planned at a reasonable distance from the planting sites?&#13;
(b)   Are there plans for training local people, particularly women and other&#13;
disadvantaged groups, in nursery work?&#13;
&#13;

69.   Other Considerations&#13;
(a)    What is the planting objective (e.g., cash income from tree products)? If&#13;
objective is cash income, are existing marketing arrangements adequate? Is&#13;
policy reform required to remove transport restrictions and other market&#13;
distortions?&#13;
(b)    How do the selected tree system and species take into account resource&#13;
usufruct rights and land capability?;&#13;
(c)        Is fertilizer organic?&#13;
(d)    If land is sloping, do you plan to plant along contours?&#13;
(e)    Is grazing control needed? If so, what arrangements have been made?&#13;

F. Special Programs for the Periphery&#13;
70.   Additional Joint Forest Management. These investments would follow the&#13;
regular village ecodevelopment procedures, except that they would not be subject to the&#13;
household-based budget constraint. They would follow applicable state procedures and&#13;
government orders for joint forest management, and where possible, be planned within a&#13;
per hectare budget constraint, with a contingency reserve for more expensive treatments&#13;
that address site-specific considerations.&#13;
71.    Voluntary Relocation. Annex 20 outlines the guidelines for these activities.&#13;

72.    Supplemental Investment. The project includes discretionary funds for PA&#13;
managers to supplement regular ecodevelopment funding above the budget constraint to&#13;
buffer areas with special needs (e.g., special watershed management priorities in buffer&#13;
areas above the PAs, communities that are especially dependent on forest resources, or&#13;
village ecodevelopment investment opportunities with economies of scale). For each PA,&#13;
the discretionary fund investments would not exceed 18 percent of the regular village&#13;
ecodevelopment investments. PA managers would allocate the funds in accordance with&#13;
site-specific needs, which generally would result in an uneven allocation of the fund across&#13;
EDCs. All discretionary fund investments would be subject to approval by the affected&#13;
EDC, but could reflect PA rather than EDC priorities. When the discretionary fuind&#13;
investments reflect PA rather than EDC priorities, the investments would not subject to&#13;
10&#13;
the contribution requirements or the budget constraint , and the PA manager would&#13;
provide a clear explanation of how the investment would directly benefit the PA.&#13;
Frequently such investments would not produce benefits that could be easily converted&#13;
into a monetary equivalent. In all other regards, discretionary reserve investments would&#13;
be subject to the agreed eligibility criteria and feasibility considerations.&#13;

sociology, anthropology; relevant Master's degree desirable.&#13;
H. Training Requirements&#13;
73.    Scope. In addition to the direct in-situ training provided by this on-going technical&#13;
assistance, NGO skills would be mobilized to provide specialized training courses in&#13;
participatory methods and areas of technical competence. Since many smaller local NGOs&#13;
may also lack these skills, training courses will also need to include their personnel.&#13;
Guidelines will be developed by national NGO consultants to provide a basis for this&#13;
training and further refine the roles and responsibilities of the microplanning team.&#13;
74.    Indicative Training Plan. Each State has developed a training plan for&#13;
microplanning and implementation support personnel as well as EDC members. As listed&#13;
in the sample training plan in the table below this will likely include: microplanning team&#13;
training by qualified NGOs and training institutes, intensive training of senior PA&#13;
personnel at the Wildlife Institute of India's ecodevelopment course, management and&#13;
technical training for inexperienced local NGOs, and study tours for PA field staff and&#13;
EDC members to other ecodevelopment areas. Such study tours for the teams and village&#13;
ecodevelopment leaders have proven an effective tool for introducing new ideas and&#13;
building confidence in achieving results in participatory settings. In addition to the training&#13;
courses listed in the indicative training program, the village ecodevelopment investment&#13;
funds themselves would used to provide training to EDC participants wherever required.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                143                              Annex 9&#13;
Annex 9: Environmental Education and Visitor Management&#13;
Background&#13;
I .    The theoretical possibility of conserving resources within a forest or protected area&#13;
(PA) by closing it to all external disturbances and threats by force is remote. Such an approach&#13;
might succeed in those few PAs located in remote and low-population density areas, but in&#13;
reality most PAs (particularly those in India) are located in close proximity to dense human&#13;
settlements. Their survival therefore depends heavily on the attitudes of the local people, and&#13;
the public and political support for the PA at local, state, and national levels. An important part&#13;
of the PA authorities responsibility is therefore to justify the existence of the PA and the&#13;
management policies chosen and implemented in it to politicians, bureaucrats, and the wider&#13;
public.&#13;
2.    In India, decisions for establishing PAs were largely made by government&#13;
administrators. Although there has been political support for the establishment of the PAs,&#13;
it is questionable whether politicians and the public will continue to accept the status quo,&#13;
as pressures for land and resources increase. PAs, therefore, are unlikely to survive in the&#13;
future unless the real benefits they confer are appreciated by the whole community.&#13;
3.    Visiting PAs can help build appreciation, but but without good management,&#13;
visitors can also adversely affect the bioidversity. All the project areas contain a variety of&#13;
visitor facilities in and around the PAs that tend to put a strain on environmental&#13;
resources. In some cases these facilities are based around such established infrastructure as&#13;
hunting lodges, forest rest houses, forest roads. In others new facilities have been&#13;
developed in the past 20 to 30 years to meet visitor demand. The pressure is most acute in&#13;
Periyar, which annually receives 10 million pilgrims and 350,000 tourists and&#13;
Ranthambhore which receives 30,000 tourists and 20,000 pilgrims. In Periyar, the negative&#13;
effects of such large numbers of visitors is particularly intense as they cluster around river&#13;
trips, popular driving routes, and the Sabrimala shrine. Local people and other&#13;
entrepreneurs establish lodges and tea-shops along the route to the temple and remove&#13;
firewood to supply the lodges and tea-shops from the PA.&#13;
4.    The village ecodevelopment component would include significant support for&#13;
environmental education and participtory ecotourism programs integrated into the overall&#13;
microplanning support activities. To avoid overlapping categories, the environmental education&#13;
activities would be aimed at audiences outside the target villages of the village ecodevelopment&#13;
component and the visitor activities would be aimed at the broader management framework.&#13;
Design of the Environmental Education and Awareness Strategy and Plan&#13;
5.    Each PA would develop its own environmental education and awareness (EEA)&#13;
strategy and plan. It would include identification of the different issues and target groups&#13;
to be covered by the program, the nature and types of activities for each target group; the&#13;
programs to link PA interpretation centers with extension and education; linkages with&#13;
other EEA programs of NGOs, universities, and schools; and institutional, informational,&#13;
research, training, manpower, financial, and organizational needs for its design and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                144                              Annex 9&#13;
6.    Professional educators, communicators, scientists, sociologists, NGOs, school&#13;
teachers and PA staff would collaborate in a workshop to reach consensus on the broad&#13;
concepts of the EEA strategy and the technical and specialist services needed for its&#13;
preparation. Preparation of the plan could be contracted out to a nodal organization or&#13;
NGO, like the Center for Environmental Education (Ahmadabad), Wildlife Institute of&#13;
India, etc.&#13;
Visitor Information and Interpretation Services&#13;
7.    Interpretation centers would be developed to educate the visitor on the PA, the&#13;
objectives of the PA, and the policies that govern its management. A properly designed&#13;
PA interpretation program would serve to awaken public awareness of the park purposes&#13;
and policies and develop a concern for its protection. It would also educate the visitor to&#13;
appreciate the importance of the PA to the region and the nation and thereby create a&#13;
constituency in support of the PA. This group can become an important ally in lobbying&#13;
for political support for conservation.&#13;
8.    There are a number of techniques available to communicate information about the&#13;
PA. All have particular uses and it is usually advisable to use several methods to get&#13;
maximum impact. The following are widely used methods for communicating with&#13;
visitors: brochures and leaflets, specialized guides and checklists, nature camps, self-&#13;
guided and guided trails and tours, audio-visual presentations, field demonstrations and&#13;
exhibits, etc. These are not discussed further as a number of reference manuals are&#13;
available for developing them. However it must be recognized that for maximum&#13;
effectiveness, these programs must be simple, easy to interpret and understand, in the local&#13;
language, directly related to the local situation, with low technology inputs and costs, and&#13;
easy to maintain.&#13;
9.    PA authorities will contract the services of an architectural consultant or firm to&#13;
design the interpretation center to fit, as far as practical, with the local architecture,&#13;
landscape, and environment of the area. The design and installation of the interpretation&#13;
program and materials would also be contracted out to a suitable NGO or institution. The&#13;
programs implemented through the interpretation centers would be designed around the&#13;
languages, customs, and lifestyles of the local people, keeping in mind the particular local&#13;
relationship between people and PA.&#13;
Education Programs for School Children&#13;
10.   Educating school children in PA neighborhoods on the values and importance of&#13;
PAs is an effective strategy for getting broad-based long-term support for conservation.&#13;
School children and youth can be brought to the PA to provide them with an experience&#13;
and understanding of its role and importance; or the conservation message can be taken to&#13;
the classrooms (through lectures and talks, audio-visual presentations, etc.). The former&#13;
could use day visits to the PAs and nature camps; or it could involve groups (particularly&#13;
of higher grade students) in short assignments to get them involved in PA activities (such&#13;
as setting up nature trails, animal surveys and census, establishing botanical collections or&#13;
study topics of interest, etc.). These programs would require simple and inexpensive&#13;
accommodation facilities such as dormitories or tents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               145                             Annex 9&#13;
IL.   A major component of the environment education program for children would be&#13;
provided through training workshops for school teachers. There are many tools available&#13;
in India (WWF Biodiversity Conservation Teaching Manual), but they are in English and&#13;
not in local languages. The EEA therefore, must try to produce a teacher's sourcebook or&#13;
adapt nationally-available materials to the local situation and language to help the teacher&#13;
in his or her presentation of the PA's special features and values and on general&#13;
environmental issues relevant to the area. Providing the teachers with these materials&#13;
would free PA staff time for other critical work.&#13;
Mass Media Campaigns for Creating Public Awareness&#13;
12.   The use of mass media in developing countries has shown phenomenal growth in&#13;
recent years. India's rapid advance in opening up its markets and liberalizing its economy,&#13;
is likely to increase enormously the use of radio, television, print media, and other&#13;
communication media. The mass media can and should be used for urban receivers. At this&#13;
level, schools and universities, policy makers, and bureaucrats can all be successfully&#13;
reached through distance education and general programs; the wide reach of mass media&#13;
gives it enormous potential for disseminating and educating the general public and national&#13;
and state level decision-makers of the country. At the rural level, however, being tailored&#13;
to local-specific issues, it has less flexibility in providing education and awareness.&#13;
Alternate Methods for Creating Environmental Awareness in PA&#13;
Surroundings&#13;
13.   India and the region as a whole has many examples of alternate methods for&#13;
education in the rural sector that would be easily adapted to this project. Examples include&#13;
street or village theater a powerful tool for communicating socially meaningful messages;&#13;
street plays, processions and protest marches to bring awareness on scientific and&#13;
environmental matters; slide shows, posters, leaflets, exhibitions, street corner&#13;
discussions, and magazines; video linked with other media (example: discussions,&#13;
lectures, visits, etc.); local extension radio giving advice and hearing complaints on issues&#13;
relevant to the locality; puppetry to make people aware of their rights; and folk media&#13;
such as folk epics and ballads, folk songs and dances, and folk tales.&#13;
14.   These alternate methods would persuade rural audiences to support conservation&#13;
of PAs and nature in general. They provide an opportunity to gain a better understanding&#13;
of people's needs and ti establish confidence through dialogue. They also permit a very&#13;
flexible approach to communication and can emphasize personal communication and local&#13;
traditions in ways that may be more easily accepted by local people.&#13;
15.   Involving children in these programs is important for two reasons. First, many&#13;
children in the remote rural areas of India do not attend school so an alternative&#13;
environment education program outside the school is necessary to reach them. Second,&#13;
children's concerts and activities always evoke greater participation on the part of local&#13;
politicians, mothers, and, gradually, fathers also. Children can also be trained as&#13;
communicators and made to talk to rural folk in their villages and at organized local&#13;
meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               146                             Annex 9&#13;
16.   Environment education must not only focus on conservation issues. It must also&#13;
reconsider the importance of human economic needs and cultural traditions in developing&#13;
ideas on conservation. In developing the communication strategy, the following points&#13;
must be kept in mind: (i) communication should not be in isolation; (ii) a multi-media&#13;
approach is more effective; (iii) the content of the program is important; (iv) there should&#13;
be sharing of ideas; (v) and there should be continuation. To determine the right kind of&#13;
medium and message for a particular audience both should be pre-tested and re-cast as&#13;
and when required on the strength of feedback from the audience. This would require&#13;
some monitoring and frequent evaluation of the program. The design and implementation&#13;
of the outreach education and awareness programs for the PAs would be largely managed&#13;
through NGOs in the area. Some of the NGOs would have experience working with&#13;
tribals. The project provides resources for contracting NGOs, for education vehicles,&#13;
equipment and materials.&#13;
Visitor Management and Participatory Ecotourism Strategy&#13;
17.   To minimize the threat to the environment from visitors, and maximize benefits to&#13;
local communities in ways that increase their stakes in long-term conservation, each PA&#13;
would prepare a management and participatory ecotourism strategy that would address&#13;
the following questions.&#13;
(a)   Is the scale of development appropriate for the local community and for the&#13;
capacity of the environment to support the facility?&#13;
(b)   What zoning measures are needed to reduce the threat to the environment?&#13;
(c)   Are roads and any trails placed to minimize intrusion on the environment?&#13;
(d)   What measures need to be taken during construction to minimize negative&#13;
effects on the environment?&#13;
(e)   Does the design for the facility make use of indigenous cultural building&#13;
forms and materials found in the surrounding areas?&#13;
(f)    Are energy sources environmentally sound and sustainable?&#13;
(g)   Are appropriate technologies employed for the treatment of organic and&#13;
other wastes?&#13;
(h)   What measures have been taken to prevent erosion?&#13;
(i)    How far do modifications and/or additions divert existing visitor pressures&#13;
on the PA?&#13;
(j)    How far were local people actively involved in planning and construction?&#13;
(k)   How far are local people involved in current operations?&#13;
(1)   In existing facilities, is the number of resident employees within the&#13;
enclaves necessary or is there scope for reduction?&#13;
Terms of reference for this study are included at the end of this annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                     147                                   Annex 9&#13;
Managing Enterprise and Visitor Enclaves&#13;
18.    The project would support investments associated with implementing the&#13;
ecotourism and visitor strategies and with improving the management of public and&#13;
private infrastructure and facilities within enclaves or adjacent to the PAs. In some PAs&#13;
existing facilities have a large residential population of staff and laborers or attract large&#13;
numbers of visitors, which results in disturbance to wildlife and depletion of forest&#13;
resources to meet fuelwood, grazing, and food needs of the residents and visitors Where&#13;
appropriate the project would support investments of civil works, equipment, and&#13;
materials, that the visitor management and ecotourism strategies recommend in order to&#13;
better manage energy, water and timber, solid waste disposal, and access needs of these&#13;
facilities, as well as the number of resident employees. The project would also help to&#13;
support proposed investments arising from research on the impacts of these installations&#13;
on wildlife and biodiversity.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report              151                            Annex 10&#13;
Annex 10: Impact Monitoring and Research on Issues&#13;
Relevant to PA Management and Ecodevelopment&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
I.    Monitoring (of project impacts, institutions and processes) and research are two&#13;
related, but different and equally important activities of the project. Through repetitive&#13;
data collection, monitoring assesses the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of the&#13;
project to determine whether these are in agreement with those anticipated. Monitoring&#13;
would also assess the effectiveness of project institutions and processes in meeting project&#13;
objectives. In contrast, research would meet the critical information needs for PA&#13;
management and village ecodevelopment activities. While research discovers useful&#13;
guidelines for management, rationalization of PA boundaries, and zonation, monitoring&#13;
uses scientific and other evidences to assess whether a particular management action had&#13;
the desired results.&#13;
2.    Monitoring and research are, however, parallel activities with continuous feed&#13;
backs. A comprehensive monitoring strategy for PA management is being developed for&#13;
the first time in India. Considerable research input is necessary therefore to design a&#13;
monitoring system, that will identify indicators, sampling and analytical methods, and feed&#13;
backs. Similarly, monitoring would generate research questions on cause-and-effect&#13;
relationships that need to be answered in order to make recommendations for project&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
B. Monitoring&#13;
Strategy&#13;
3.    Conceptual Framework. The monitoring of ecological and socioeconomic&#13;
impacts of this project would be based on a conceptual framework that would address the&#13;
objectives of the project. The framework would embrace PA values, anticipated changes,&#13;
indicators, sampling methods, analytical methods, mechanisms of feedback and project&#13;
adjustment, roles and responsibilities for monitoring, and other considerations. More&#13;
specifically, the conceptual framework for the monitoring would address the following&#13;
questions:&#13;
(a)   What is the purpose of the monitoring and who are the clients?&#13;
(b)   What key questions require answers?&#13;
(c)   What indicators, methods of measurement and analysis would be used (and&#13;
what criteria were used to determine their selection)?&#13;
(d)   What would be the roles and responsibilities of state forest development&#13;
(SFD) staff and cooperating institutions, (including of local communities)&#13;
in participatory monitoring?&#13;
(e)   What would be the mechanisms for incorporating information into projects&#13;
already in progress?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                152                             Annex 10&#13;
4.    Objectives of monitoring. Monitoring through a consistent set of measures&#13;
would periodically do the following:&#13;
(a)    Provide an integrated view of the present status of biodiversity in the PA&#13;
(b)   Provide an integrated view of the socioeconomic conditions and&#13;
interactions between PAs and people inside and immediately around the PA&#13;
that are relevant to the project&#13;
(c)    Assess their trends in conditions and interactions&#13;
(d)   Evaluate whether the project activities, institutions, and process have had&#13;
the desired and anticipated effects&#13;
(e)   Identify project components, the absence, inadequacy or ineffectiveness of&#13;
which cause non-compliance with expected values&#13;
(f)    Provide guidelines for project adjustment in the light of evaluation.&#13;
5.    PA values. The PAs coming under the project have important biodiversity values&#13;
which are of regional, national, and international significance. The progressive erosion of&#13;
these values is of concern and their restoration is the objective of the PA management and&#13;
of this project. These values range from habitats of single species (e.g., lion in Gir), large&#13;
prey-predator systems (e.g., Pench and Ranthambhore), to ecosystems with very high&#13;
species richness and endemism (Periyar and Buxa). Other values relate to PA-people&#13;
interactions such as traditional knowledge systems (e.g., ethnobotany), tourism, watershed&#13;
etc. One or more measurable indicators that together describe the values would form the&#13;
basis for evaluation.&#13;
6.    Anticipated changes. A statement of anticipated changes on the status of&#13;
biodiversity in the PA, disturbance factors, and relevant socioeconomic attributes would&#13;
form a set of predetermined standards, or template. Against this template, the findings&#13;
from monitoring would be compared and evaluated. Such statements would address the&#13;
current status (e.g., pristine, sustainable, and degraded use areas) and expected&#13;
trajectories. In the case of project activities, institutions, and processes, the statement&#13;
would reflect what is expected from project plan.&#13;
Indicators&#13;
7.    Ecosystems in the PAs and the mutual impact of their interaction with people are&#13;
so complex that an assessment of their status and trends would be based on a set of&#13;
indicators. In order to develop a conceptual framework and guide their selection,&#13;
measurement, and evaluation, indicators, would be placed in several categories. These&#13;
categories reflect the values for which the PA is being managed, the control and mitigation&#13;
of threats to the project, and project institutions and processes.&#13;
8.    Response Indicators. Response indicators closely and clearly relate to the&#13;
biodiversity values of the PA and of PA-people interactions, in a practical context.&#13;
Response indicators include ecosystem structure, function, and processes. They must be&#13;
sensitive to disturbance but stable under natural conditions so that changes due to&#13;
disturbance and management can be detected. Assemblages of several species often found&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                153                             Annex 10&#13;
together have considerable conservation value in indicating endemism, rarity, regional&#13;
characteristics, etc. Typical examples would be herpetofauna in the rain forests of the&#13;
western Ghats (Periyar) and the large prey-predator and associated floral community in&#13;
central India (e.g., Pench). Such characteristic faunal and floral assemblages would be&#13;
used as key indicators to detect and measure change. This approach would be preferable&#13;
to the past practices of using a few indicator species or an inventory of all the species.&#13;
Indicators of ecosystem processes would include productivity, regeneration etc.&#13;
9.    Habitat Indicators. These would be used to estimate the expected range of&#13;
ecological conditions and to identify the likely causes of changes in response indicators.&#13;
These indicators would include physical structure of the habitat (e.g., soil types, habitat&#13;
complexity), or processes (e.g., siltation, erosion, water flow).&#13;
10.   Stress or Disturbance Indicators. These measure the activities (often human) and&#13;
other processes (natural) that are the sources of disturbance, and cause changes in the&#13;
response indicators. Typical examples would include grazing, fuel wood removal, and&#13;
tourism&#13;
11.   Socioeconomic Indicators. These reflect attributes of human populations in and&#13;
around the PA that are of relevance to PA management and this project because of mutual&#13;
interactions and impacts between them and the PA. Particular attention should be paid to&#13;
impacts on vulnerable groups, especially tribals and women.&#13;
12.   Reciprocal Commitment Indicators. Indicators of reciprocal commitments&#13;
pinpoint activities that are expected to affect both the socioeconomic and disturbance&#13;
indicators and thus to have positive effects on the response indicators.&#13;
13.   PA Management Indicators. These indicators would measure the effect of PA&#13;
management activities proposed in the project.&#13;
14.   Institutions and Processes. These indicators would assess the impacts and&#13;
effectiveness of the new institutions and processes of each project component and the&#13;
project as a whole.&#13;
15.   Selection Criteria for Indicators. The following considerations would be used on&#13;
the selectopm of indicators:&#13;
(a)    Would closely and clearly relate to the predetermined benchmarks&#13;
(b)   Possibility of integrating over time and space to enable comparisons&#13;
(c)    Availability of historical data for retrospective monitoring&#13;
(d)   Applicability to a wide variety of areas to enable consistency across PAs&#13;
(e)    Cost-effectiveness: maximum information with minimum sampling time and&#13;
effort.&#13;
(f)    Amenable to sampling by non-specialists; e.g.,. quantification should be&#13;
simple&#13;
(g)   Detectability of trends&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                154                             Annex 10&#13;
(h)   Ability to distinguish between succession, cycles, random changes,&#13;
disturbance, and mitigation&#13;
(i)    Wide dissemination of knowledge about indicators&#13;
()    Simplicity and elegance without over simplification.&#13;
Sampling&#13;
16.   The sampling design would address methods, intensity and interval, precision,&#13;
interobserver reliability, personnel and logistic needs, and data storage and retrieval. Once&#13;
the indicators have been selected there is often a wide range of methods available to&#13;
measure them. The overall sampling area for each PA would be estimated from remote&#13;
sensing and/or field surveys. Vegetation status would be determined by remote sensing,&#13;
transects, or quadrants. Animal presence/absence or absolute/relative abundance would be&#13;
assessed from quadrants or line transects (either through direct sightings or indirect&#13;
evidences such as pellets and scats); invertebrates by soil samples, light traps, butterfly&#13;
nets, etc. The sampling locations could be temporary or random. Socioeconomic sampling&#13;
would be field based, interview based, or both; interviews would be closed- or open-&#13;
ended.&#13;
17.   The time interval between sampling could be annual, biannual (dry and wet&#13;
periods), seasonal, or monthly. Since for most living organisms a year forms a natural&#13;
cycle, yearly monitoring would be sufficient in most cases. However, many indicators of&#13;
processes (e.g., productivity, grazing) are seasonal in nature, and thus would require&#13;
biannual or even seasonal sampling. The sampling design would also address requirements&#13;
for personnel and their expertise and the scope for participatory monitoring, especially of&#13;
socioeconomics and disturbance indicators. Generally, the sampling design would:&#13;
(a)    Be sensitive to the nature and extent of change anticipated&#13;
(b)   Allow relocation of sampling points&#13;
(c)    Allow objective and verifiable recording&#13;
(d)   Have recording procedures within the capability of the local management&#13;
(e)    Ensire that significant but unforeseen changes do not go unnoticed&#13;
(f)    Use optimal sampling precision is optimal in relation to sampling intensity&#13;
(g)   Use sampling interval that reflects seasonal cycles.&#13;
Development Process:&#13;
18.   Analytical Framework for Analysis and Decision Making. The analysis and&#13;
interpretation of indicator and other data would be in the context of ecosystem theory,&#13;
known threats, and project activities. The results would be integrated into information&#13;
useful to decision makers and other interest groups. The analytical framework would&#13;
consist of the following:&#13;
(a)    A conceptual model of the mutual interactions and relationships among the&#13;
various sets of indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                155                             Annex 10&#13;
(b)   A statistical model for testing trends in response indicators in relation to&#13;
changes in other indicators. More specifically,&#13;
(i)    determine whether the nature and extent of changes on PA values&#13;
reflected in the response indicators correspond to&#13;
(ii)   quantitatively associate such changes with other specific indicators&#13;
(c)    An appropriate set of summaries and aggregations of indicators and&#13;
derived indices that facilitate easy perception of trends and changes in PA&#13;
values and the impacts of specific project components.&#13;
(d)   Clearly stated subjectivity in the selection, monitoring, and interpretation of&#13;
indicators and derived indices&#13;
(e)    Guidelines on reporting intervals and formats.&#13;
19.   Mechanisms for Project Adjustment. Mechanisms for feed back into project and&#13;
PA management would ensure project adjustment in response to findings from monitoring.&#13;
Active participation of PA management personnel and local people would ensure that&#13;
there is an ongoing interaction between monitoring and management. More over, periodic&#13;
reports and guidelines from the monitoring organization would also ensure changes to&#13;
substantive project design.&#13;
20.   Development of Monitoring System. The impact monitoring system would&#13;
consist of&#13;
(a)    Conceptual framework addressing the above issues&#13;
(b)    A potential set of indicators for each PA&#13;
(c)    Sampling design, to meet personnel, logistic, and training needs&#13;
(d)   Participatory monitoring&#13;
(e)    A framework for analysis and decision making&#13;
(f)    Mechanisms for feedback and project adjustment&#13;
The conceptual framework would be developed into a monitoring system through&#13;
consultations with other scientists, PA management, local people, and NGOs; through&#13;
pilot studies on some PAs to assess sampling precision, resource needs, etc.; and through&#13;
peer review&#13;
21.   Operation of Monitoring System. Once an impact monitoring system has been&#13;
designed to cover all PAs, monitoring would be carried out by the research coordinating&#13;
organization in each PA. The first step in the process would be the adoption of the&#13;
national monitoring system design to local conditions through a consultative process. This&#13;
is the first time that India is developing a comprehensive monitoring system, and the initial&#13;
stages would be a learning exercise requiring the total attention of a dedicated team of&#13;
scientists interacting closely with PA managers and other interested groups. The&#13;
coordinating organization would oversee the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               156                            Annex 10&#13;
(a)   Estimation of the current status, extent, and trends in response indicators,&#13;
and associated human threats&#13;
(b)   Measuring the response, habitat, and disturbance indicators, and indicators&#13;
of project activities, institutions, and process&#13;
(c)   Providing periodic reports on impacts and effectiveness of project&#13;
activities, and guidelines on project adjustment.&#13;
(d)   Periodic review of monitoring design to incorporate new information.&#13;
22.   Other Design Considerations. The following are the other considerations in the&#13;
impact monitoring design:&#13;
(a)   Monitoring is a long term activity that needs organization, long term&#13;
funding, and commitment. Simplicity at every stage of monitoring,&#13;
especially in data collection and analysis, would minimize personnel,&#13;
expertise and financial requirements for long term monitoring. Moreover,&#13;
the association of local research organization in monitoring would ensure&#13;
the availability of local expertise if needed&#13;
(b)   The monitoring system adopted at the beginning of the project would be&#13;
updated based on the experience gained as the project progresses&#13;
(c)   Quality control at every stage of monitoring would be enhanced by&#13;
training, standardization of data collection procedures, and peer review&#13;
(d)   Developing a comprehensive monitoring program for complex terrestrial&#13;
ecosystems with many pathways of impact is a challenging task. Since a&#13;
comprehensive monitoring system is being developed in India for the first&#13;
time, the conceptual model and its elaboration into a monitoring system&#13;
initially would depend largely on experiences elsewhere in the world,&#13;
supported with only limited field tests. This monitoring system would be&#13;
constantly upgraded (ensuring continuity) through feedbacks from research&#13;
(e)   In order to create awareness among the public on the status of biodiversity&#13;
in the PA and about project impacts, the findings from monitoring would&#13;
be made available to a wider audience other than the PA management and&#13;
project personnel. The environmental awareness program of the project,&#13;
project newsletters, periodic review meetings, and scientific meetings and&#13;
publications would be used as media for this. Participatory monitoring&#13;
would also ensure that the local people, NGOs, etc., are aware of the&#13;
project impacts. The monitoring data would be made available to those not&#13;
associated with the project, for further analysis and peer review. The&#13;
organization that designs the monitoring system would elaborate on the&#13;
mechanisms for dissemination of findings from monitoring.&#13;
23.   Performance Monitoring Indicators. After the impact monitoring system is&#13;
designed, a summary of its key feaatures will need to be integrated into the Performance&#13;
Monitoring Indicators Matrix (Annex 16).&#13;

C. Research&#13;
Research Strategy&#13;
24.   In order to achieve the objectives of better PA management and ecodevelopment for&#13;
conservation of biodiversity, a better understanding of the relevant issues is necessary. An&#13;
almost total paucity of information on the ecological and socioeconomic issues in five of the&#13;
seven PAs (in Gir and Periyar some research has been carried out), makes necessary a&#13;
strenuous effort to generate the critical information through research. Such research should&#13;
also address long term information needs of the PAs&#13;
25.   In view of the constraints described in Annex 2, research for generating critical&#13;
information needs of this project requires a novel and strategic approach. This approach should&#13;
address the foliowing:&#13;
(a)    The consultative processes and mechanisms necessary to ensure that research&#13;
addresses information needs that are critical to this project and to the long term&#13;
management of the PA&#13;
(b)   The need to develop research interest and expertise in local institutions&#13;
around the PAs so that information needs of the PAs are met locally in the&#13;
long run&#13;
(c)   Mechanisms to ensure that project PAs support and attract sustained&#13;
research that would meet their information needs&#13;
(d)   Mechanisms to ensure that research findings guide PA management and&#13;
ecodevelopment activities on a sustained basis&#13;
(e)    Mechanisms for coordination of research both at the national and PA&#13;
levels.&#13;
26. The strategic approach to identify critical information needs of the PAs would include&#13;
(a) a national level framework that would identify information needs common to all PAs; and&#13;
(b) PA level research planning to adapt the national level framework to PA level so as to&#13;
include site specific information needs. This planning would not be done by professional&#13;
researchers in isolation, but rather through a consultative process involving PA management,&#13;
local stake holders, and other interest groups.&#13;
27.   Although critical information needs might vary among PAs to some extent, most&#13;
information needs are common to them.These needs relate to:&#13;
(a)    PA-people interactions; these are:&#13;
(i)   impacts of legal or customary human uses such as grazing and&#13;
NTFP collection&#13;
(ii)  illegal human activities: encroachment, poaching&#13;
(iii) human, livestock and crop depredation&#13;
(b)   PA management, which comprises:&#13;
(i)   impacts of PA management&#13;

(ii)    zonation and PA boundary with reference to the types and extent of&#13;
various ecosystems, and animal ranges&#13;
(iii)   impacts and control of forest fire&#13;
(iv)    fragile ecosystems or habitats&#13;
(v)    key species requiring attention&#13;
(vi)   connectivity with surrounding areas&#13;
(vii)   population relocation initiatives&#13;
(viii)  tourism&#13;
(c)    Village ecodevelopment, including:&#13;
(i)    structure and dynamics of local communities; cultural heritage and&#13;
institutions; traditional knowledge systems&#13;
(ii)    socioeconomics: tenure rights, participatory processes in traditional&#13;
organizations, access to, use and management of resources&#13;
(iii)   income generation opportunities: subsistence employment&#13;
opportunities&#13;

Research Coordination&#13;
28.   Since attempts at research by the PA Management have often been unsuccessful,&#13;
research is best entrusted to research organisations, universities, and independent researchers.&#13;
However, the capacity for research is lirmited at both the national and local levels, and research&#13;
planning, therefore, should address these constraints and consider the capacity that could be&#13;
developed during the project. National research institutions have national level mandates and&#13;
have to shift their research focus topically and geographically when required. It is, therefore,&#13;
inevitable that much of the research must be carried out by local institutions located near the&#13;
PA and individual researchers working in the area. This would also build up research interest&#13;
and expertise around the PA and support infornal groups of scientists who are working in a&#13;
particular PA With adequate financial support PAs would then have a sustainable source of&#13;
information for PA management. Only very few PAs have local institutions (Kerala Forestry&#13;
Research Institute (KFRI) for Periyar and State Forestry Research Institute (SFRI) for Pench)&#13;
and have informal groups of scientists (Nagarhole and Ranthambhore) that can independently&#13;
conduct socioeconomic and ecological research. Some human capacity development is&#13;
necessary for local institutions and individual researchers, for example through trainirg and&#13;
collaborative projects with national institutions. A preliminary list of potential local institutions&#13;
for conducting research in the PAs is given below. The research strategy would include an&#13;
expansion of this list and an additional inventory of the availability and capabilities of individual&#13;
researchers.&#13;
29.   Given the limited capacity at national and local levels to conduct research in the short&#13;
term, research activities in the project should be phased so that the national and local&#13;
researchers can absorb the work load and develop their capacity to meet further requirements.&#13;
30.   Effective coordination of research both at the national and PA levels is necessary in&#13;
order to ensure (a) that research addresses issues of immediate and long term relevance to PA&#13;
management and ecodevelopment; (b) that these issues are identified through a consultative&#13;
process; (c) efficient funding; (d) adequate training for the research staff, (e) smooth conduct of&#13;
field studies; (f) timely compilation, evaluation, and dissemination of results; (g) ongoing&#13;
interaction among the researchers, PA management, and other interest groups that facilitate&#13;
incorporation of research findings in PA management and ecodevelopment activities.&#13;
31.   To free PA management from responsibility for administering research funds on a day&#13;
to day basis, the entire research funds for a PA may be entrusted with one coordinating&#13;
institution. This institution should have the expertise to conduct and coordinate research, and&#13;
have adequate financial and administrative flexibility to contract, administer, and subcontract&#13;
the research finds if needed. Research coordination in each PA is perhaps best entrusted to a&#13;
local research institution, with whom the PA management could interact on a day-to-day basis.&#13;
It would be the responsibility of the coordinating research institution to (a) contract research&#13;
from PA, (b) subcontract research projects to other individuals and organisations if needed and&#13;
to administer the funds; (c) produce periodic and final reports of the research projects; (d)&#13;
arrange for periodic independent review of the projects; (e) arrange for short term studies when&#13;
requested by the PA management; (f) interact with PA management to facilitate incorporation&#13;
of research findings into management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                165                             Annex 10&#13;
32.   Although some PAs have local institutions with the capability to coordinate research&#13;
(e.g. KFRI for Periyar and SFRI for Pench), others do not have such institutions that are&#13;
readily identifiable. An assessment of the capabilities of the local institutions to coordinate&#13;
research is thus necessary. In the absence of capable local institutions, research coordination in&#13;
some PAs may have to be done by a national institute.&#13;
Research Projects&#13;
33.   The research requirements are best organized into distinct projects, although these&#13;
would not necessarily be mutually exclusive. Some of these would be long-term projects&#13;
(2-4 years), while others would be of short duration (up to 18 months). The former would&#13;
often address long-term information needs of the PA, the latter would often address&#13;
immediate information needs. Short duration projects would also cover information needs&#13;
that are identified on a contingent basis as the project progresses. It should be the&#13;
responsibility of individuals and organizations contracting individual research projects to&#13;
hire research staff (e.g., research fellows) and procure equipment etc., as and when&#13;
required. A few potential research projects, that combine several information needs, are&#13;
given below. The current limits on capacity for conducting research, mean that onlv about&#13;
4 to 8 major research projects (including ecology and socioeconomics) can be taken up in&#13;
each PA during the next five years without substantial reduction in quality. Similarly, only&#13;
up to a maximum of about 10 short term projects can be taken up.&#13;
34.   The following steps are suggested in the implementation of research in each PA:&#13;
(a)   Identification of information needs in consultation with PAs, NGOs,&#13;
national and local research institutions, and local people&#13;
(b)   Review of existing information to identify gaps&#13;
(c)    Formulation of distinct research projects&#13;
(d)   Contracting of all research projects to one institution identified as the&#13;
coordinating institute&#13;
(e)    Continuing interaction between the PA management, researchers, and&#13;
coordinating institutions to facilitate the conduct of research and to ensure&#13;
that research addresses issues of relevance to management and that PA&#13;
management and ecodevelopment activities are guided by research findings&#13;
(f)    Periodic compilation, evaluation and dissemination of research findings to&#13;
the PA management, scientists, and the public.&#13;
3 5.   Individual research projects are estimated to cost about Rs. 900,000 for long-term&#13;
projects (2-4 years) and Rs. 250,000 for short-term projects. The cost of individual projects is,&#13;
however, expected to vary by about 20 percent. These costs include equipment needed&#13;
specifically for the project, fuel and hiring of vehicle, fellowships, travel and per diem, etc, and&#13;
a contracting fee at a specified percentage.&#13;
Research Facilities&#13;
36.   None of the PAs have basic facilities for research and these would be provided by&#13;
the PA management. These would include (a) a research building with accommodation for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                     166                                Annex 10&#13;
field researchers; (b) a vehicle for research, the use of which would be moderated by the&#13;
research coordinating institution; and (c) basic equipment such as a refiigerator, oven, etc.&#13;
that would be shared by researchers in the field. Equipment required for specific projects&#13;
would be acquired as part of the project. Some PAs would also provide one or two field&#13;
stations, for short camping trips away from the main base.&#13;

Examples of Potential Research Projects&#13;
37.   Although the information needs vary among the PAs, much would be common and&#13;
basic, since very little research has been carried out in most PAs. The potential for&#13;
research depends on:&#13;
(a)   The ecological complexity of the PA; a PA with greater biological diversity&#13;
at ecosystem or species levels (e.g., Periyar) has greater research potential;&#13;
(b)   Complexity of management; a large predator-prey system (e.g., in&#13;
Ranthambhore) when confined to a small PA would require greater&#13;
information for effective management&#13;
(c)   Complexity of human interactions; a PA with a large human population&#13;
interacting with it in diverse ways would also require a greater information&#13;
input for effective management&#13;
38.   The potential for research is also dictated by the capability of local and other&#13;
research institutions to conduct research.&#13;
39.   Landscape/Ecosystem level studies. Of fundamental importance to PA&#13;
management is information on regional landscape (consisting of the PA and surrounds)&#13;
and extent and status of communities/ecosystems contained within. This information is&#13;
necessary for&#13;
(a)   Setting ecological boundaries of the PA&#13;
(b)   Zonation of the park into core, buffer, and tourism zones&#13;
(c)   Identifying degraded and fragile ecosystems&#13;
(d)   Identifying critical animal movement corridors within the PA and in&#13;
adjacent areas&#13;
40.   (e)   A proper understanding of the role of the PA in regional conservation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                169                            Annex 10&#13;
41.   This baseline data, however, is not available for any of the PAs in a form that is of&#13;
practical value to the management. This information would also be helpful as a major&#13;
element in setting up the monitoring program&#13;
42.    The questions addressed could include:&#13;
(a)   Types, distribution, extent, fragmentation and linkages at landscape and&#13;
ecosystems levels&#13;
(b)   Major disturbance regimes at landscape and ecosystem levels; (c) land use&#13;
pattern trends&#13;
(c)   Fragile ecosystems or habitats&#13;
(d)   Size and proportion of ecosystem types protected etc&#13;
43.    Research methods would include analysis of satellite images and aerial&#13;
photographs with ground truthing, and ground studies on vegetation composition and&#13;
status, and disturbance types.&#13;
44.   Outputs would include maps showing topography, major land features, water&#13;
bodies, classified vegetation, major disturbance regimes, trends in land use changes,&#13;
important animal movement corridors etc.&#13;
45.   Species/population level studies. Faunal and floral distribution and abundance&#13;
with reference to the landscape and ecosystems are critical to PA management for many&#13;
reasons:&#13;
(a)   Rationalization of PA boundaries and zonation with reference to animal&#13;
distribution and movement&#13;
(b)   Identification of habitat features (e.g., fodder distribution, water holes) or&#13;
management measures (e.g., tourism management, roads) that are critical&#13;
to animal distribution&#13;
(c)   Identifying seasonal movement pattern of animals, especially large&#13;
mammals and its implications for PA management (e.g., crop damage,&#13;
water hole management)&#13;
(d)   Monitoring the status and management requirements of species or species&#13;
assemblages or communities that need particular management attention.&#13;
46.   The questions addressed could include:&#13;
(a)    The distribution and abundance pattern of species or species groups with&#13;
reference to ecosystems or communities and seasonal trends&#13;
(b)   Relation of patterns to habitat features and management activities&#13;
(c)   The extent of fragmentation of population of species of concern and&#13;
management implications&#13;
(d)   The life history and demographic characteristics of keystone or threatened&#13;
species&#13;
(e)   The dietary and other habitat requirements of important species.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                170                             Annex 10&#13;
47.   The methods employed could include studies on species composition in various&#13;
ecosystems on a seasonal basis, population density or other abundance estimates,&#13;
estimation of age/sex composition and birth and mortality rates, analysis of habitat&#13;
features, etc.&#13;
48.   The outputs could include an overlay of animal and plant distribution on the&#13;
ecosystem maps, identification of habitat features critical to animal distribution, population&#13;
projections of threatened species, etc.&#13;
49.   Crop and livestock depredation: Crop damage by wild ungulates and cattle&#13;
lifting by large carnivores is a major management problem in many of the PAs. Many of&#13;
the PAs have already taken management measures, often on an ad hoc basis, to contain&#13;
these problems. These measures include payment of compensation, erection of wildlife&#13;
control structures such as electric fencing and stone walls and trenching. However, a&#13;
comprehensive assessment of the nature and extent of damage in terms of spatial and&#13;
temporal distribution and economic loss to villagers has not been done in any PA. This&#13;
would thus form a typical short term project.&#13;
50.   Long-term biological research studies. Even though the major focus of research&#13;
would be on issues of immediate concern to PA management and village ecodevelopment,&#13;
research during the project period would also begin to address issues of long-term&#13;
concern. these would include grazing impacts under different management arrangements,&#13;
the role of fire in maintaining critical habitats, and long-term studies on critically&#13;
endangered species. The phasing of these studies would, however, depend on the capacity&#13;
available to undertake research.&#13;
51.   PA/People Interactions. Effective PA management will require a better&#13;
understanding of relationships between PA resources and human populations. This&#13;
information will be essential for assessing the social and economic impacts of PA&#13;
establishment and ecodevelopment activities, providing opportunities for local&#13;
participation in PA management, improving and contributing knowledge on PA resources&#13;
for management purposes, and examining the impact of indigenous and traditional&#13;
practices. Generally, the level of research activity on PA/people interactions across the&#13;
eight sites is low, if not absent. Some research has been carried out in Gir, Ranthambhore&#13;
and Periyar. The scope of research into PA/people interactions is extensive. Potentially&#13;
useful projects could include investigations into the following areas.&#13;
52.   Indigenous knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems used by human&#13;
populations, especially tribal groups, and their contribution to biodiversity conservation&#13;
are important. Studies would investigate:&#13;
(a)    Cultural aspects of relationships between natural resources in PAs and&#13;
people, especially tribal groups&#13;
(b)   The management of natural resources through traditional systems of&#13;
organization and implications for PA objectives&#13;
(c)    The economics of livelihood strategies based on forest resources with&#13;
specific foci on women, tribal groups, and other marginal communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                171                             Annex 10&#13;
Studies of this nature are likely to be long-term efforts, although some could be broken&#13;
down into short-term research projects. A typical short-term project could investigate the&#13;
cultural aspects of collection of a particular non-timber forest product, providing&#13;
information within a larger project investigating cultural and ecological aspects of the&#13;
activity.&#13;
53.   Social organization and participation studies. The village ecodevelopment&#13;
component of the project relies on a high level of local participation in the proposed&#13;
activities. For this and other similar projects it will be important to investigate the process&#13;
and outcomes of participation in ecodevelopment activities. The information will be&#13;
critical in refining the microplanning process, developing monitoring plans, and improving&#13;
relations between PA authorities, NGOs, and local people. Again, the scope of&#13;
investigations in this area is extensive. Potentially useful studies could include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)    The nature and extent of participation in village ecodevelopment activities&#13;
(b)   Relationships between the social organization of local communities and&#13;
participation in ecodevelopment activities&#13;
(c)   Nature of decision-making in local communities and implications for&#13;
microplanning and implementation of reciprocal commitments&#13;
(d)   Conflict resolution mechanisms in local communities.&#13;
54.   Socioeconomic impacts of PA establishment. It will be important to have more&#13;
information on the impact of PA establishment on the socioeconomic status of resident&#13;
populations and coping strategies adopted. This research would help policy makers to&#13;
better understand the dynamics of PA establishment and to evaluate the level of&#13;
appropriate compensatory assistance for groups negatively affected, and to evaluate the&#13;
minimum level of incentives required.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                     189                                  Annex 11&#13;
Economic Analysis of Reciprocal Commitments and Associated Investments. The&#13;
project design set the budget constraint for village ecodevelopment investments at Rs&#13;
10,000 per family. This was based on two things. First on implicit contingent valuation&#13;
derived from the participatory rural appraisal exercises undertaken during project&#13;
preparation; second on budgets used to pay for protection by local people under&#13;
comparable joint forest management programs. During the project, and prior to&#13;
implementation of a follow-on project, a study would further analyze the impacts of the&#13;
village ecodevelopment commitments and investments on family incomes and the&#13;
adequacy of the village ecodevelopment investments as incentives to permanently curtail&#13;
unsustainable use of PA resources. The budget for transitional support for voluntary&#13;
relocation is based on Bank experience with involuntary resettlement in India. The study&#13;
would also review the extent to which the regular village ecodevelopment investment both&#13;
by itself and in combination with transitional support for voluntary relocation compensate&#13;
for losses due to the original establishment of the PAs.&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference:&#13;
Ecodevelopment Incentives and Income Impacts Study&#13;
Reports to:         Assistant IG, Wildlife, and Ecodevelopment Project Steering Committee&#13;
Objectives          Evaluate the impacts of the village ecodevelopment commitments and investments&#13;
on family incomes and the adequacy of the village ecodevelopment investments as&#13;
incentives to permanently curtail unsustainable use of PA resources.&#13;
Responsibilities:   Part I. On the basis of a desk study, develop conceptual framework, quantify&#13;
assumptions&#13;
Analyze with and without PA situations (i.e., PA impact)&#13;
*  Estimate the cash and subsistence income foregone per family due to the&#13;
creation of a PA. Use data from the Joint Forest Management Incentives Study&#13;
and other readily available and relevant sources to estimate the value of&#13;
fuelwood foregone, grazing foregone, non-timber forest products foregone,&#13;
and daily wage labor from logging foregone. Indicate both the medium per&#13;
family and medium and range among groups that win or lose (e.g., specialized&#13;
resource using groups such as headloaders and graziers; people living inside&#13;
the PA, on the PA periphery, and in communities affecting the PA that do not&#13;
participate in the project; and within group gender and tribal differences).&#13;
Note seasonal dimmensions of income, patterns of time allocation, and&#13;
occupational structure.&#13;
*  Analyze the extent to which the village ecodevelopment investments&#13;
compensate for incomes that are foregone due to the creation of the PAs.&#13;
Using the assumption that the village ecodevelopment investments would&#13;
yield an income (cash and subsistence) stream that would yield at least a 10&#13;
% internal rate of return (IRR), compare the net present value (NPV) of the&#13;
stream of income with estimated NPV of income foregone due to the creation&#13;
of the PA. For groups living within the PA, also compare the combined total&#13;
of income from the combination of regular village ecodevelopment&#13;
investments and the transitional support associated with voluntary relocation,&#13;
using the same 100 IRR assumption. Note seasonal dimmensions of income,&#13;
patterns of time allocation, and occupational structure.&#13;
Analyze with and without reciprocal commitments and village investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

situations (i.e., Project Impact)&#13;
* Estimate the cash and subsistence income per family that comes from PAs in&#13;
spite of current enforcement efforts. Analyze the potential impact of village&#13;
commitments to curtail future unsustainable use of PA resources on family&#13;
incomes. Indicate both the medium per family and medium and range among&#13;
key groups (e.g., specialized resource using groups such as headloaders and&#13;
graziers; people living inside the PA, on the PA periphery, and in&#13;
communities that do not participate in the project; and within group gender&#13;
and tribal differences) of the potential income foregone. Note seasonal&#13;
dimmensions of income, patterns of time allocation, and occupational&#13;
structure.&#13;
* Analyze the adequacy of the village ecodevelopment investments as incentives&#13;
for village commitments to curtail unsustainable use of PA resources. Using&#13;
the assumption that the village ecodevelopment investments would yield at&#13;
least a 10 % IRR, compare the NPV of the stream of income with the&#13;
estimated NPV of income potentially foregone due to commitments.&#13;
* Analyze the impact of village ecodevelopment investments on overall family&#13;
incomes, using the 10% IRR assumption. Indicate both the medium per family&#13;
and medium and range among key groups (e.g., specialized resource using&#13;
groups such as headloaders and graziers; people living inside the PA, on the&#13;
PA periphery, and in communities that do not participate in the project; and&#13;
within group gender and tribal differences) of the potential net income due to&#13;
investments.&#13;
* Analyze incremental impact of the combination of per family of potential&#13;
income foregone due to the commitments and the potential income due to the&#13;
investments.&#13;
* Analyze structural impacts such as changes in patterns of time allocation or&#13;
occupational structure.&#13;
Identify completed and ongoing studies that potentially might provide detailed&#13;
field data on resource use in PAs (e.g., studies on NTFP use funded by Ford&#13;
Foundation).&#13;
Design a study using field data to test the assumptions on project impact on all&#13;
local people in three villages in the light of project experience. In one village, also&#13;
analyze the extent of compensatory support for participants in voluntary&#13;
relocation.&#13;
Present draft report (in English) covering the conceptual framework, methodology,&#13;
quantified assumptions, and field study design to a workshop that includes MOEF&#13;
staff, PA staff, NGOs, and consultants working on monitoring, feasibility&#13;
analysis, social assessment, and preparation of the Second Ecodevelopment&#13;
Project, and revise the report in response to comments. Report must be written in&#13;
language that is easily understood by non-economist decision-makers.&#13;
Part II. Field Study and Program Design Recommendations&#13;
Implement the field study that tests assumptions in three villages&#13;
Apply the results of the field study, develop recommendations for future&#13;
ecodevelopment programs, (e.g., size of village ecodevelopment investment budget&#13;
per family).&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               193                           Annex 12&#13;
Annex 12: Preparation of Future Biodiversity Projects&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    The Ecodevelopment Project would provide a framework and financing to prepare&#13;
large future projects listed as priorities in India's Environmental Action Program.&#13;
Experience shows that larger biodiversity projects usually take three to five years to&#13;
prepare and appraise; if the government uses the period of the Ecodevelopment Project to&#13;
initiate future projects they could be implemented four to ten years from the time&#13;
preparation begins. The concepts behind the proposed projects would reflect lessons&#13;
learned during the implementation of relevant smaller scale, more immediate projects&#13;
currently being financed by the UNDP, other international agencies, bilateral agencies, or&#13;
NGOs, (including any projects receiving GEF support channeled through UNDP). The&#13;
Ecodevelopment Project support for preparing later proposals would help develop a&#13;
pipeline of large-scale biodiversity projects potentially eligible for future consideration by&#13;
larger financiers such as IDA or by combinations of cofinanciers (including GEF).&#13;
2.    The project concepts outlined below were developed largely through consultations&#13;
with a wide variety of interested stakeholder institutions and individuals. The project files&#13;
include more extensive descriptions and include lists of those consulted.&#13;
Ecodevelopment Project 11&#13;
3.    Background. MOEF's original proposal for India's first biodiversity project with&#13;
GEF was for a more extensive undertaking, and MOEF has repeatedly expressed interest&#13;
in such a project for the future. Potential sites include additional biosphere reserves, virgin&#13;
forest areas, a wide range of areas currently protected under Project Elephant and Project&#13;
Tiger and other protected areas with special botanical significance. Possible sites might&#13;
also include those nine currently receiving technical assistance and training support under&#13;
a UNDP/FAO financed project being implemented by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).&#13;
Preparation would develop indicative plans and preliminary social assessments for specific&#13;
proposed project areas. It would explore the use of an endowment or trust mechanism,&#13;
using experienced financial, legal, and institutional experts. It would also reflect lessons&#13;
learned from the first ecodevelopment project.&#13;
4.    Objectives. The second ecodevelopment project---Ecodevelopment Project II---&#13;
would extend the ecodevelopment strategy to additional PAs, establish a national&#13;
ecodevelopment program and test the ecodevelopment strategy on a pilot basis in selected&#13;
multiple use areas (MUAS). As in the first ecodevelopment project, the main objectives&#13;
would be to:&#13;
(a)   Improve the capacity of PA management to protect and conserve&#13;
biodiversity; increase opportunities for local participation in PA&#13;
management activities, decisions&#13;
(b)   Reduce negative impacts of local people on biodiversity and vice versa;&#13;
increase collaboration of local people in conservation efforts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

8.    Suppliers. A wide range of institutions of different shapes and sizes supply and use&#13;
biodiversity information at different points in the research and development (R&amp;D) or&#13;
knowledge spectrum, ranging from the generation of basic scientific information to the&#13;
application of infornation for commercial and management purposes. At the upstream end of&#13;
the spectrum, institutions such as the following collect and supply biodiversity information&#13;
mostly for their own use: the Botanical Survey of India (BSI), the Zoological Survey of India&#13;
(ZSI), the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and&#13;
Natural History (SACON), Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), the&#13;
National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), the National Bureau of Animal&#13;
Genetic Resources (NBAGR) and the National Bureau of Fish Genetics (NBFG) of the Indian&#13;
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI)&#13;
and the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial&#13;
Research (CSIR), and other academic and basic research institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

9.    Users. The Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) and the&#13;
Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research&#13;
(CSIR), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
the Foundation for Revitalization of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT), the All India Medical&#13;
Research Council (AIMRC), the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), and agro-&#13;
based and pharmaceutical industries use biodiversity information for commercial or&#13;
management purposes. Most of these institutions lie at the downstream end of the R&amp;D or&#13;
knowledge spectrum.&#13;
10.   Existing Networks and Information Systems. An Environmental Inforration&#13;
System (ENVIS) has been established, and is operational under the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Forests (MOEF) with 20 centers that are potential sources and users of environmental&#13;
information. Two of these centers, the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) and the Zoological&#13;
Survey of India (ZSI) are dedicated nodes for the supply of biodiversity inforrnation. India has&#13;
other information systems in place such as district level information nodes through the National&#13;
Informatics Centre (NIC). The Foundation for Revitalization of Local Health Traditions&#13;
(FRLHT) in Bangalore is a non-governmental organization that has established a network of&#13;
distributed databases called INMEDPLAN, The Indian Medicinal Plants Distributed Databases&#13;
Network, this links 10 nodal agencies concerned with the collection, preservation, propagation,&#13;
and uses of medicinal plants in India, which cover more than 8,000 plant specimens and a chain&#13;
of 48 in situ and ex situ conservation parks. The Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring&#13;
Centre (IGCMC) of the World Wide Fund for Nature (India) (WWF-D) is a non-governmental&#13;
institution dedicated to organizing, maintaining and disseminating biodiversity conservation&#13;
infornation, especially in relation to the management of land, water, forests, and protected&#13;
areas (PAs).&#13;
Ex-Situ Genetic Resources Conservation&#13;
11.   Long-term Goals. The ex situ Genetic Resources Conservation Project would over&#13;
the long-term undertake to:&#13;
(a)   salvage selected species and genetic variability that would otherwise be lost if&#13;
left in situ within protected or multiple use areas&#13;
(b)   Increase access to these genetic materials through their replication,&#13;
manipulation and exchange for priority uses&#13;
(c)    Manage these genetic materials safely, reliably, and efficiently&#13;
(d)   Promote public awareness and education of ex situ genetic resources&#13;
conservation.&#13;
12.   Project Objectives. The ex situ Genetic Resources Conservation Project would&#13;
undertake a nationally-coordinated and user-oriented effort to:&#13;
(a)    Expand the stock of ex situ genetic resources&#13;

14.   Suppliers and Users. A wide range of institutions with different objectives supply&#13;
and/or use genetic resources conserved ex situ at different points in the R&amp;D or knowledge&#13;
spectrum. On the one hand, academic and basic research institutions supply genetic information&#13;
to, on the other, agriculture-based and pharmaceutical and health-based industries applying&#13;
genetic technologies for commercial and industrial purposes. Major institutions supplying and&#13;
using genetic materials from ex situ conservation include the National Bureau of Plant Genetic&#13;
Resources (NBPGR), the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) and the&#13;
National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources (NBFGR) of the Indian Council of Agricultural&#13;
Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture; the Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic&#13;
Plants (CIMAP), the National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) and the Central Drug&#13;
Research Institute (CDRI) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the&#13;
Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology, and the All-India&#13;
Council of Medical Sciences (AICMS), Ministry of Health. Genetic prospecting and&#13;
commercial gene trading by private entrepreneurs would need to be developed for India, and&#13;
could be promoted by hybrid public-private sector institutions like the Biotech Consortium of&#13;
India Limited (BCIL).&#13;
15.   Existing Arrangements. A number of different networks exist for ex situ genetic&#13;
conservation in India. For example, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)&#13;
coordinates in vivo and in vitro conservation of primarily domesticated species of agricultural&#13;
importance. The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), Ministry of Environment and Forests&#13;
(MOEF) coordinates in vivo conservation of wild fauna, mainly endangered species. The&#13;
Conservation Division of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) coordinates in vivo&#13;
conservation of wild flora in botanic gardens and arboreta. The Department of Biotechnology&#13;
(DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology coordinates in vitro conservation of microbial&#13;
organisms. In spite of these arrangements for the ex situ conservation, there is a need for a&#13;
user-oriented coordination of in vivo and in vitro genetic resources conservation at the national&#13;
and state levels.&#13;
Preparation Activities for All Projects&#13;
16.   The preparation activities for the above are still being identified but would involve&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)    Consensus building&#13;
(b)   Expert advice on applying state-of-the-art experience from other countries to&#13;
the Indian situation; on-the-job trairing&#13;
(c)    Training needed during the preparation phase, prior to project implementation&#13;
(d)   Estimating project costs in accordance with the project objectives&#13;
(e)    Arranging project financing&#13;
(f)    Compilation of background information including:&#13;
(i)    government policies on biodiversity and project focus (e.g., biodiversity&#13;
information&#13;
(ii)   existing institutional responsibilities, capacity, and coordination&#13;
(iii)  lessons from other projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(iv)    strategy for project focus (e.g., biodiversity information)&#13;
(v)    Rationale for donor financing.&#13;
(g)    Addressing Project Management Considerations including&#13;
(i)    allocation of implementation responsibilities, staff plans, plans for&#13;
contractual support, and coordination mechanisms for specific project&#13;
activities;&#13;
(ii)    development of the implementation schedule,&#13;
(iii)   arrangements to ensure the flow of funds;&#13;
(iv)   arrangements to&#13;

*      facilitate procurement and contracts for goods and services;&#13;
*      coordinate progress reviews and reports;&#13;
*      promote communication on project status and impacts&#13;
*      e.valuate and audit the project.&#13;
(h)    Justification and analysis of project impacts including descriptions of the&#13;
project benefits, environmental and social impacts, sustainability, and risks.&#13;
Initial Documentation&#13;
17.    Initial documentation describing the project preparation activities of the Second&#13;
Ecodevelopment Project, the Biodiversity Information Project, and the Ex-Situ Genetic&#13;
Resources Conservation Project would include the&#13;
(a)    Initial project concept paper covering the title, justification, objectives, and&#13;
estimated scope of the proposed project&#13;
(b)    List of stakeholders who will be involved in project preparation consultations;&#13;
(c)    Schedule of preparation tasks currently anticipated&#13;
(d)    Draft terms of reference for consultants (including NGOs and autonomous&#13;
agencies) and government agencies to undertake specific preparation tasks&#13;
during the next 18 months&#13;
(e)    Description of how project preparation activities relate to ongoing work in&#13;
programs supported by other donors (such as the Sustainable Development&#13;
Network of UNDP and the ODA support to IGCMC; in the case of the&#13;
Biodiversity Information Project)&#13;
To the extent that the GEF is being considered as a possible source of financing, it would be&#13;
important to include as part of the preparation an explanation of the project's global significance, its&#13;
role in addressing priority GEF concerns, and its compliance with the incremental financing&#13;
requirement (which is likely to involve the analysis of costs of a hypothetical project that would&#13;
exclude globally significant activities financed by GEF).&#13;

Responsibilities:   Review findings of financial sustainability study (see Annex 11). Review other&#13;
options besides endowments that could be legally constructed as a trust and may&#13;
not already have been used in parks. Assess relative advantages of using an&#13;
endowment rather than, say. a sinking fund, a revolving fund, a social fund, or a&#13;
venture capital fund. Consider what justifies the use of a trust versus classic&#13;
investment assistance.&#13;
Determine the most appropriate mecanism in terms of (a) conservation issues to be&#13;
addressed, (b) mecanisims to address these issues that are most appropriate for&#13;
India, (c) justification for locking up capital and incurring transaction costs of&#13;
designing and operating such a mecanism.&#13;
Review available information on overseas endowments and study programs for&#13;
management of trusts in India. Give special consideration to nature and&#13;
composition of government boards, professional staff, financial management&#13;
arrangements, funding criteria, decisionmaking processes, disclosure and&#13;
dissemination policies, involvement of stakeholders (including NGOs), fund-&#13;
raising processes, and funding sources&#13;
Identifv stakeholders including NGOs and any others who should be involved in&#13;
designing, creating, and managing a trust&#13;
Identify funds and potential sources of funds; identify and analyze scope within&#13;
national policy or potential changes in national policies that would allow the&#13;
creation of a trust for ecodevelopment, identify and meet with key national-level&#13;
stakeholders interested in an endowment for ecodevelopment.&#13;
Recommend strategy on the creation of a trust, including a process that would&#13;
promote broad consensus-building. If appropriate, draft formal proposals and/or&#13;
government orders.&#13;
Present draft report (in English) covering the above to a workshop of key&#13;
stakeholders and decision makers, and produce a final report that responds to&#13;
comments made during the workshop.&#13;
Duration:           Six months, spread over an 18 month period.&#13;
Qualifications:     Financial, Legal, and Institutional Development expertise. Would have&#13;

Annex 14: Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
National shopping&#13;
1.    National shopping procedures would be used to procure vehicles, information&#13;
technology, field, office and laboratory equipment, construction materials in individual&#13;
contracts not to exceed US $20,000. Rate contracts of the Directorate General of Supplies and&#13;
Disposal (DGS&amp;D), New Delhi, would only be acceptable as a substitute for procurement&#13;
under national shopping. State rate contracts would not be acceptable.&#13;
2.    The essential elements of national shopping are (i) clear description and quantity of the&#13;
item(s) as well as a specified date of delivery; (ii) price quotations obtained from several&#13;
suppliers, usually at least three to assure competitive prices; (iii) evaluation of quotations to&#13;
follow sound public/private sector practices of the purchaser; and (iv) the purchase order&#13;
placed with the lowest evaluated supplier by suitably incorporating the terms of the accepted&#13;
offer. Further negotiations are not permitted after the lowest qualifying quotation has been&#13;
evaluated.&#13;
3.    All documents associated with the purchase of goods under national shopping&#13;
procedures would be subject to selective post-review by visiting missions. Such reviews would&#13;
concentrate on the competitiveness of prices paid and physical inspections of the relevant items.&#13;
4.    The schedule of critical steps for national shopping suggests that about 10 weeks&#13;
would normally be required from the preparation of the initial specifications to the delvery&#13;
date. Accordingly, to ensure that required equipment and goods are on hand to start the work&#13;
program for a fiscal year that begins on April 1, procurement activities should normally begin&#13;
by the preceding January 15.&#13;
Categorization of Consultants, Training, and Contractual Services&#13;
5.    The consultants, training, and contractual services would be used for the following&#13;
purposes:&#13;
(a)    Policy and project preparation: US$2.7 million&#13;
(b)    Capacity building: US$3.9 million, and&#13;
(c)   Implementation support: US$8.1 million.&#13;
Criteria for the Selection of Non-Govemment Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
6.    The project would seek NGO participation in village ecodevelopment support teams,&#13;
research activities (especially of social science aspects and project monitoring), environmental&#13;
education, project preparation, and training for the full range of project components. The state&#13;
project entities responsible for implementation and MOEF would invite from interested NGOs&#13;
detailed proposals for collaboration for work in and around the PAs and at the national level&#13;
respectively. The state entities and MOEF would be responsible for reviewing the proposals&#13;
and agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NGOs in the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                212                             Annex 14&#13;
7.    The selection of NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:&#13;
(a)    As part of the legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body under&#13;
the relevant State Law. It should regularly maintain its accounting records and&#13;
have properly audited annual statements of income and expenditure.&#13;
(b)   It is essential that the NGO have a proven track record in the proposed activity.&#13;
To avoid creating any biases and misconceptions in the minds of the people, the&#13;
NGO should have secular operations (i.e. development activities of religious&#13;
NGOs would not be associated with proselytizing) and should not be affiliated&#13;
with any political organization.&#13;
(c)    For project activities requiring field activities over many sites (e.g., village&#13;
ecodevelopment support, socioeconomic research, project monitoring,&#13;
environmental education), NGOs should have adequate numbers of field level&#13;
staff conversant with the local dialect and customs, and have a clear&#13;
understanding of the socioeconomic and political situation of the area or areas&#13;
in which they would operate. They should also possess excellent&#13;
communication skills and good rapport with the community so as to involve&#13;
them in the project activities.&#13;
(d)   A prior understanding of the concept of ecodevelopment would be desirable.&#13;
Owing to the nature and extent of the physical coverage of the program, NGOs&#13;
participating in the project would be part of a larger effort involving other&#13;
NGOs, government officials, professional and academic institutions, and&#13;
others. Hence, the NGO should be able to interact smoothly with, and be part&#13;
of, a team.&#13;
(e)    Finally, the NGO should have internal stability so as to assure long-term&#13;
support to the project.&#13;
Contractual Arrangements for Consulting Services (large NGOs,&#13;
autonomous govemment agencies, and private firms)&#13;
8.    Consultancy services estimated at US$6.0 million with consulting firms-mainly large&#13;
NGOs-for management support, implementation assistance, and special studies would be&#13;
contracted on terms and condition in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants, which are set forth in Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Consultancy contracts could&#13;
include up 100% for overhead charges including computing equipment hardware and software.&#13;
9.    Abbreviations used in the description of the steps include:&#13;
(a)    TOR - terms of reference;&#13;
(b)   LOI - letter of invitation;&#13;
(c)    NOL - IDA's no objection letter after required prior reviews of&#13;
documentation throughout the procurement process.&#13;
10.   Prior review by IDA is required for:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                213                             Annex 14&#13;
(a)    Draft LOI package including the draft letter of invitation, terms of reference,&#13;
formats for submission of technical and financial proposals, draf contract&#13;
under which services will be performed before it is issued to the selected&#13;
consultants&#13;
(b)   Evaluation of technical proposals before opening the financial proposals&#13;
(c)    Draft negotiated contract with agreed description of services before signing of&#13;
the contract and&#13;
(d)   Conformed signed copy of the contract before authorizing disbursement&#13;
against the contract.&#13;
11.   Using the average amounts of time taken for each step in most projects, the schedule of&#13;
critical steps suggests that about 44 weeks would normally be required between the&#13;
preparation of the draft LOI package and the team leader being in post. Accordingly,&#13;
procurement activities should usually begin in early July to ensure that the team leader is in post&#13;
by the following 1 April. However, the actual number of weeks required can be shortened&#13;
significantly if project authorities quickly prepare draft documents and review proposals&#13;
promptly.&#13;
Contractual Arrangements for Consulting Services (small NGOs)&#13;
12.   Consultancy services with small NGOs in contracts less than US$20,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$1.6 million for participatory planning and implementation assistance with the&#13;
Village Ecodevelopment component, and design of monitoring and evaluation procedures&#13;
would be contracted in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of consultants. With&#13;
respect to review, (i) the model documents for inviting proposals, (ii) terms of reference,&#13;
(iii) all single source contracts (not applicable to contracts for individuals), (iv) all&#13;
contracts for assignments of a critical nature (regardless of value), and (v) all contracts&#13;
(original or amendments) valued at more than US $20,000 would be subject to prior&#13;
review by IDA.&#13;
13.   The schedule of critical steps for employment of small NGOs suggest that about 14&#13;
weeks would be required from the preparation of the initial terms of reference (TORs) until the&#13;
team leader is in post. Accordingly, in order to ensure that required services are on hand to&#13;
start the work program for a fiscal year that begins on April 1, procurement activities should&#13;
begin by the preceding December 15.&#13;
Contractual Arrangements for Consulting Services (Individuals)&#13;
14.   Procedures for employment of individuals-estimated at US$4.2 million-are usually&#13;
less formal. IDA only requires prior approval of terms of reference and the qualifications and&#13;
conditions of employment before an agreement (or contract) is negotiated and signed. In such&#13;
cases, the major concern will be that the individual is suitably experienced and capable.&#13;
However, where three or more individuals are to be employed and coordination,&#13;

Agency. August 1981.&#13;

administration, and collective responsibility can become difficult, IDA would normally advise&#13;
that a consulting firm be employed.&#13;
Ecodevelopment Reciprocal Investments&#13;
15.   Investments expenditures associated with reciprocal commitments would not to&#13;
exceed Rs. 10,000 (US $285) per family including local contributions over a three-year&#13;
period, and would finance small works and village development activities over 2,000&#13;
widely scattered EDC locations over the five-year project period. Civil works required for&#13;
these investments would be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA:&#13;
(i) under community participation by direct contracting with non-governmental&#13;
organizations or village communities; or (ii) by soliciting quotations from at least three&#13;
qualified contractors; or (iii) through force account. Annex 8 contains a full description of&#13;
how community participation would function. Construction materials for these works,&#13;
aggregating to about US $13.0 million, would be procured following national shopping&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. Small equipment and goods required for these investments&#13;
would be procured through national shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. Livestock,&#13;
including breeding stock, young animals, fertile eggs for hatching, bees and silk worms,&#13;
estimated to cost about US $800,000 would be obtained under direct contracting&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. For each investment a list would be kept showing the&#13;
purpose, location, total cost, and breakdown of costs into the various forms of procurement,&#13;
which would be the basis of SOEs submitted with withdrawal requests. Documentation&#13;
describing each investment and the associated purchases would be available for selective post-&#13;
review by visiting missions. The focus of such reviews would be on the competitiveness of&#13;
prices received and the quality of work completed.&#13;

Annex 15: Project Administration&#13;
Shared Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
1.    Overview. State governments, through their existing PA authorities within the&#13;
state forest departments (SFDs) or through newly-created autonomous implementing&#13;
bodies, would be responsible for field level execution. For many project activities, the PA&#13;
authorities or implementing bodies would develop partnerships with or delegate to NGOs&#13;
and village groups. They would also contract tasks to individual specialists, professional&#13;
research and training institutions, and other groups as needed. The degree of responsibility&#13;
of PA staff, contracted experts, and local people in implementing the different project&#13;
components varies. PA officials would have the lead implementation responsibility for&#13;
improved PA management activities and hire local people to undertake some of the works.&#13;
Village ecodevelopment would involve a full partnership of local NGOs, PA staff, and&#13;
local residents in the initial negotiation of reciprocal commitments. Although the&#13;
implementation of the reciprocal commitments would also be shared, local people would&#13;
be likely to have the highest work load. Environmental education would involve extensive&#13;
use of contracted experts. A combination of PA staff and contracted experts would&#13;
conduct the monitoring and also involve local people in monitoring where possible.&#13;
Outside experts would both conduct and coordinate research, but with the mandate to&#13;
meet the needs of PA managers. Outside experts and facilitators would conduct the&#13;
financial sustainability and ecotourism strategies that are part of the long-term framework&#13;
component.&#13;
2.    PA-Level Third-Party Support. For each state forest department (SFD),&#13;
domestic third-party (contractual) implementation support would include:&#13;
(a)    Direct administrative support and services (for the initial period of project start-&#13;
up and implementation)&#13;
(b)    Full-time specialists in ecology and in social science and, in some cases, in&#13;
management information system operation&#13;
(c)    Specialists for visitor and ecotourism and financial sustainability studies.&#13;
(d)    Specialists (including NGOs) in participatory planning to be members of village&#13;
ecodevelopment microplanning support teams&#13;
(e)    Research and monitoring specialists working on biological, social, technical,&#13;
financial, and institutional aspects&#13;
(f)    Trainers.&#13;

incentives are limited. The project does provide improved amenities for junior level field staff,&#13;
and extensive training opportunities. The project design also acknowledges that lack of&#13;
incentives prevents the recruitment of qualified permanent research staff; and therefore relies on&#13;
contracted research.&#13;
PA Committees&#13;
5.    Committee Structure. Each PA is making its own arrangements to manage and&#13;
coordinate the project activities in accordance with local conventions. The main&#13;
innovation would be an explicit effort to expand their composition beyond govermnent&#13;
employees and to include representatives from a range of outside specialists and&#13;
stakeholders. Although their names and functions vary among the states, PA committees&#13;
or task forces typically would include a project steering committee, a district and/or&#13;
regional coordination committee, a PA coordination/implementation task force, and an&#13;
impact monitoring and research coordination working group, an environmental education&#13;
coordination working group, and numerous ecodevelopment committees (EDCs).&#13;
National Level Coordination and Staffing&#13;
6.    National-Level Organizations. MOEF would expand existing offices to handle&#13;
the project work. MOEF would in turn be assisted by NGOs, autonomous agencies, and&#13;
consultant firms and individuals employed under contractual arrangements with MOEF.&#13;
Through these contracts, the offices would acquire substantial flexibility with respect to&#13;
appointment of temporary staff and consultants, including levels of remuneration.&#13;
7.    Project Tiger Office. The Project Tiger Office (PTO) would coordinate the project at&#13;
the national level. The PTO would expand to comprise two wings, each headed by a Joint&#13;
Director. One wing would consist of existing staff positions and continue to handle the Project&#13;
Tiger activities. The second wing would focus on the Ecodevelopment Project. The&#13;
ecodevelopment wing of the PTO would:&#13;
(a)   Promptly release funds to states in three installments&#13;
(b)   Promptly process and submit withdrawal applications for national-level&#13;
expenditures to the DEA's Controller of Aid Accounts and monitor the&#13;
progress of withdrawal applications prepared by the state governments&#13;
(c)   Compile project accounts and arrange required audits&#13;
(d)   Facilitate procurement of goods and contracting of services in a timely manner&#13;
and in accordance with Bank and government requirements&#13;
(e)   Produce semi-annual progress reports that include information on the above&#13;
items, as well as other information on national-level project activities and an&#13;
overall summary of project progress&#13;
(f)   Provide training and communication outlining financial and administrative&#13;
procedures for the project&#13;
(g)   Provide additional clarification and communication on project issues as needed&#13;
between implementing states, national policy makers, donors; other national&#13;
stakeholders, and the general public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(h)    Make arrangements to hire and supervise contractual specialists who would&#13;
provide implementation services and review at the national level.&#13;

The concept paper and subsequent consultations would then determine longer-term&#13;
arrangements for sustained project preparation.&#13;
National Committees&#13;
10.   The Ecodevelopment Project Steering Committee would facilitate center-state&#13;
coordination and provide policy guidance on project activities and work plans. The&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               231                            Annex 16&#13;
Annex 16: Project Performance Review&#13;
and Implementation Schedule'&#13;
Strategy&#13;
I .    Use of Project Performance Information. Use of implementation review and&#13;
progress reports on biological, socioeconomic, financial, institutional, and other factors&#13;
would be integral to project management, providing feedback and accountability to assist&#13;
in problem-solving and adjustment. The adaptive management approach would quickly&#13;
incorporate lessons learned from monitoring feedback. This review would provide&#13;
information on which to take corrective actions and/or further refine the project design.&#13;
2.    Purpose and Composition of Project Performance Indicators and&#13;
Benchmarks. The project implementation benchmarks outlined below would provide an&#13;
explicit estimate of performance expectations and a basis on which to measure whether the&#13;
project is performance in these initial expectations. The project performance review would&#13;
compare actual experience with the benchmarks. While the indicators would incorporate&#13;
findings about project impacts to the extent they are available from the monitoring&#13;
component (see Annex 10), there would be a need for more immediate measures of&#13;
project performance. Therefore, the project performance review would focus on measures&#13;
of project implementation (inputs. procedures and outputs) that would indicate whether&#13;
the project is following key elements of its design. These implementation indicators would&#13;
serve as interim proxies for measuring project impacts, on the assumption that the project&#13;
design would result in the desired impact. Tables 1-5 list the indicators and benchmarks.&#13;
3.    Objectives of Semi-Annual Progress Reporting. The semi-annual progress&#13;
reports would compile a selection of information that has been acquired and used for&#13;
internal management purposes, to meet the needs of outside audiences. The regular&#13;
reporting channel to the GOI, external financing agencies and project stakeholders of&#13;
project performance would:&#13;
(a)   provide summary information on project implementation status that&#13;
addresses key concerns of financiers and stakeholders&#13;
(b)   help make project management accountable and measure the effectiveness&#13;
of project management procedures&#13;
(c)   provide the tangible evidence of project benefits needed to sustain&#13;
budgetary and political support,&#13;
(d)   identify issues which require GOI or Bank intervention.&#13;
4.    Content of Semi-Annual Progress Reports. The PA field directors, MOEF&#13;
officials, and contracted specialists would be responsible for ensuring that the reports (a)&#13;
efficiently provide the information required to meet the above objectives, (b) are timely,&#13;
Guidelines subject to revision to reflect experience in practice. Revision will be documented through&#13;
exchanges of letters and comprehensive updating as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

and (c) do not become a burdensome bureaucratic exercise. Field directors of each PA&#13;
would submit semi-annual progress reports to their respective state forest departments and&#13;
the PTO. These progress reports would incorporate measurement of project&#13;
implementation for all project components. They would not be limited to measuring&#13;
physical inputs and outputs -- compliance with procedural guidelines would also be&#13;
important. In addition to the implementation indicators the reports would also include data&#13;
on other aspects of project implementation status such as staffing, technical assistance,&#13;
studies, training, budget, procurement, expenditures and coordination mechanisms. The&#13;
reports would include comments on current issues and problem-solving strategies.&#13;
5.     Completion Report. The primary objective of the Project Completion Report&#13;
would be to describe and analyze the state of the project at, or shortly after, its&#13;
completion, to compare the costs and currently expected benefits with those expected at&#13;
project inception and thereby contribute to an assessment of the effectiveness of the&#13;
project and the implementing agency. It would reinforce self-evaluation, would draw&#13;
lessons from experience and would serve as a mechanism to disseminate these lessons. It&#13;
would include an assessment of the original project objectives and design and of the&#13;
methods used and decisions taken in the course of project implementation. Topics covered&#13;
would include project identification and preparation, implementation, operating&#13;
performance, financial performance, institutional performance and development, and&#13;
reevaluation of project impact and benefits.&#13;

Annex 17: Environmental Analysis&#13;
1.    The India Ecodevelopment Project is classified as a "B" category project according to&#13;
the Bank's Operational Directive 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), because it is not likely to&#13;
have major adverse environmental impacts. However, in order to ensure that project&#13;
investments meet the objectives of protecting the environment, a preliminary environmental&#13;
analysis was initiated during the project preparatory phase.&#13;
2.    The purpose of the environmental analysis of the India Ecodevelopment Project is to:&#13;
(a)    Assess the potential environmental impact, if any, of activities proposed in the&#13;
indicative plans,&#13;
(b)    Assess the degree to which environmental safeguards are incorporated into&#13;
existing project designs and operations&#13;
(c)    Recommend appropriate measures for strengthening environmental&#13;
management within the Project.&#13;
The environmental analysis is confined to the discussion of the environmental and not the&#13;
social aspects of the Project. (The Social Assessment is outlined in Annex 18).&#13;
3.    The Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring Center (IGCMC) of the Worldwide&#13;
Fund for Nature - India and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) were responsible for&#13;
studying project proposals and other relevant materials and providing a preliminary&#13;
analysis of the environmental issues related to the project. Their analyses constitute an&#13;
initial discussion of environmental impacts relevant to the project. They also provide a&#13;
framework for incorporating site specific analysis on an ongoing basis during project&#13;
implementation. This Annex summarizes the analyses.&#13;
Project Activities&#13;
4.    The activities supported under the India Ecodevelopment Project comprise:&#13;
(a)   Improved Protected Area Management&#13;
(b)    Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
(c)    Education, Impact Monitoring and Research&#13;
(d)   Overall Project Management&#13;
(e)    Preparation of Future Biodiversity Projects.&#13;
5.    The analysis was confined to the broad range of activities falling under categories (a)&#13;
and (b) above, because these are the field development activities. Category (c) was excluded&#13;
because it represents a set of supportive activities (education, research, etc.) that does not have&#13;
potential to cause direct environmental impacts. Category (d) involves staffing and temporary&#13;
office facilities for the duration of the project. Proposed activities under category (e) are still to&#13;
be defined and are not to be implemented under the current project. An environmental analysis&#13;
of the project concepts would be done during their design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 248                              Annex 17&#13;
Potential Environmental Impact&#13;
6.    The preliminary environmental analysis included examination of the potential effects of&#13;
a wide range of activities on the environment, the safeguards or mitigation measures provided&#13;
under existing operational procedures, and the existing capability for sound implementation&#13;
(see Tables I and 2). Preliminary analysis indicates that project activities would produce&#13;
beneficial environmental impacts, by improving productivity of forest and non-forest resources&#13;
and reducing existing pressures on protected area resources. Most of the proposed project&#13;
activities identified in the indicative plans are small-scale and localized. The potential of these&#13;
activities for adverse impact is therefore, limited in scope and significance. Most activities are&#13;
also expected to be labor-intensive and involve little mechanization and construction work.&#13;
7.    The initial environmental analyses confirms that the specifics of project activities would&#13;
conform to environmental protection objectives. However, it also includes preliminary&#13;
recommendations for improving environmental considerations in the design and operations,&#13;
and for improving skills and training to implement them, where these are inadequate.&#13;
Protected Area Management&#13;
8.    In this component a range of management and protection activities will evolve&#13;
from a participatory PA planning process. The type of technologies generally applied in&#13;
PAs, the likely scale of operations, and local environmental conditions make it unlikely&#13;
that the potential for impact will be significant in scope It should be easily manageable&#13;
within current operational procedures and guidelines. Nevertheless,, management&#13;
investments will be monitored by further site-specific reviews to ensure that threats to&#13;
biodiversity and environmental conditions do not develop later. The PA management&#13;
investments can be grouped into the following categories:&#13;
(a)    Eradication of weeds and assisted regeneration of native species&#13;
(b)    Small soil and water conservation works, including check and stop dams,&#13;
bunds, ponds, desilting, gully plugging, etc.&#13;
(c)    Construction of communication towers, fire lines and watch towers,&#13;
improvements of existing roads, sign boards, boundary markers, etc.&#13;
(d)    Animal control structures, such as electric fences and stone walls;small-&#13;
scale administrative, staff and research buildings&#13;
(e)    Small solid waste disposal infrastructure works&#13;
Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
9.    In this component the scope and nature of a range of development activities, would be&#13;
determined and implemented by local conmmunities on a village by village basis according to&#13;
local environmental conditions and needs. Using participatory rural appraisal surveys in&#13;
sample communities in and around the PAs, the project preparation teams have identified&#13;
an indicative list of possible ecodevelopment investments. These investments can be&#13;
grouped into the following categories:&#13;
(a)    Construction of crop protection structures such as stone walls, trenches, and&#13;
energized fences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                249                             Annex 17&#13;
(b)    Establishment of fuelwood, fodder, and agroforestry plantations&#13;
(c)    Construction of village-level irrigation facilities, most probably tube wells, stop&#13;
dams, and micro-irrigation schemes&#13;
(d)   Promotion of small scale crop and agricultural development activities such as&#13;
sericulture, mushroom, and sisal cultivation&#13;
(e)    Development of small scale farm- and non-farm-based alternative income&#13;
generation operations such as poultry rearing, bee keeping, lac production,&#13;
handicrafts, tailoring&#13;
(f)    Promotion of improved energy saving devices such as biogas plants, solar&#13;
cookers, and improved chulas.&#13;
10.   These investment ideas will require monitoring in site-specific review to judge&#13;
whether they meet eligibility criteria. Not all investments would necessarily be adopted;&#13;
others may be identified during more detailed planning.&#13;
11    All ecodevelopment activities established under the project would go through a&#13;
rigorous process of participatory microplanning at the local level to ensure that proposed&#13;
activities are consistent with the environmental and social objectives of the project. PA&#13;
staff and local NGOs would meet, as appropriately trained support teams, with the&#13;
targeted communities to help them develop their plans in detail. The teams would also&#13;
conduct feasibility analyses for social and environmental soundness of proposed&#13;
ecodevelopment investments and ascertain whether the proposed investments would meet&#13;
the eligibility criteria. Only activities meeting all of the above criteria would be financed&#13;
under the project. Annex 8 explains the eligibility criteria and microplanning process.&#13;
Future Action Proposed&#13;
12.   As a follow-up to the preliminary work of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), and&#13;
Worldwide Fund for Nature - India (WWF), a contracted national-level organization&#13;
would review plans for initial improvements in PA management and initial microplans, and&#13;
develop further guidelines as needed to address specific issues. Thereafter, PA ecologists&#13;
would carry out site-specific environmental analysis of selected project interventions. Only&#13;
activities that are environmentally sound according to the above analysis would be eligible&#13;
for financing under the project. The PA performance review and the national level review&#13;
teams would monitor compliance with this environmental eligibility criteria.&#13;

Annex 18: Social Assessment&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Importance of Interactions. The sustainability of biodiversity conservation in&#13;
protected areas (PAs) depends above all on the nature of human interactions with PA&#13;
resources. The design of the Ecodevelopment Project is based on this understanding. The&#13;
establishment of PAs significantly affects a variety of human population groups; these&#13;
groups in turn have a significant impact on the PA. Project investments designed to&#13;
minimize the negative and strengthen positive results of these mutual effects are based on&#13;
their nature and extent. The innovative participatory approach taken by the project would&#13;
enable each of these investments to be designed and negotiated by each community backed&#13;
up by PA authorities addressing specific site and population needs.&#13;
2.    Sources of Analysis. Each state provided analyses of the social impacts&#13;
anticipated for their ecodevelopment program and of the strategy they plan to adopt to&#13;
ensure that vulnerable groups will be full participants in decision-making and benefits&#13;
under the project. In addition, independent consultants are conducting more detailed social&#13;
assessments. This document provides a framework for incorporating these state analyses&#13;
based on data provided during project preparation and appraisal. It starts from an&#13;
identification of the major stakeholder groups involved, and among these stakeholders, the&#13;
tribals, women, and poor who are most socially vulnerable. Next, a summary analysis of&#13;
stakeholder interaction with the PA demonstrates priority areas for project investment on&#13;
the basis of greatest interaction between land and people, paying special attention to&#13;
vulnerable groups. The assessment of potential investments that follows is related to the&#13;
project's objectives for improving the effects of interactions between PAs and people, as&#13;
outlined in the Indicative Plan. An overview of likely impacts on tribals, poor, and women&#13;
is presented together with indicative project strategies for addressing these concerns.&#13;
Finally, other key social issues in determining project success are identified and discussed.&#13;
Stakeholders in Project Sites&#13;
3.    Variety. The multiple uses of PA resources and the long history of human&#13;
habitation in forest areas are reflected in the variety and numbers of stakeholders found in&#13;
the project sites, and typically in most PAs throughout India (see Table 1). Stakeholders&#13;
can be found in the form of human settlements within the PA boundaries, government&#13;
agencies operating in and around the PA, private enterprises using PA resources, local&#13;
villagers in the periphery of PAs, and tourists and pilgrims visiting the PAs.&#13;
4.    Settlements. There is a long history of habitation within PA boundaries although&#13;
some stakeholders whose traditional livelihoods are highly dependent on access to forest&#13;
resources, have been led by curtailed access to pursue employment outside the PA.&#13;
Nevertheless, some tribal groups collecting NTFP and graziers such as the Maldharis in&#13;
Gir remain. Similar long histories of habitation are also found with revenue villages, often&#13;
comprised of cultivators residing in enclaves that have been legally excluded from national&#13;
park and sanctuary boundaries (e.g., Palamau). Equally well established in PAs are cultural&#13;
sites and their support staff who serve large numbers of pilgrims (e.g., Gir and Periyar).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               256                             Annex 18&#13;
More recent settlements, mainly within this century, are forest villages found in two of the&#13;
seven sites. Forest villages were created to provide a supply of labor for commercial forest&#13;
management, but such job opportunities have also declined with the designation of forest&#13;
areas as PAs.&#13;
5.    Forest Department. The key government stakeholder continues to be the Forest&#13;
Department with the Wildlife division primarily responsible for PAs, and the Territorial&#13;
division operating in much of the periphery. Other government agencies are also important&#13;
and powerful stakeholders in PAs with interests in mining, hydropower generation,&#13;
irrigation, fisheries, roads, and tourism. Within this set of interests, agencies concerned&#13;
with water resources are the most common across PAs.&#13;
6.    Commercial Interests. Private and public commercial interests are also&#13;
stakeholders. For example, a monoculture plantation has been established for paper&#13;
production in Periyar Sanctuary. In the periphery of some PAs, large-scale commercial&#13;
cash crop enterprises place demands on natural resources for both processing and its labor&#13;
force (Buxa and Nagarhole), but can provide income sources for PA residents (Periyar and&#13;
Nagarhole). The ability of government agencies and private interests to act on their&#13;
commercial interests comes not only from power vested by the state, but also from the&#13;
support of peripheral PA populations wanting irrigation, transport, employment, etc. and&#13;
the Wildlife Act (1972), which permits certain extractive processes in sanctuaries.&#13;
7.    Periphery. Stakeholders on the periphery of PAs, although generally less&#13;
dependent on PA resources, still derive substantial income from PAs, which also serve as&#13;
important reserves of resources in times of scarcity. For many peripheral villages, PAs are&#13;
important sources of grazing, fodder, and fuelwood. These populations also derive&#13;
significant supplemental income from the collection and sale of NTFP, employment in&#13;
commercial forestry operations, and small-scale industries such as furniture production&#13;
and fisheries. However, with the designation of PAs, access to these resources and&#13;
opportunities is decreasing, resulting in illegal use of PA resources and encroachment.&#13;
Transitory stakeholders within PAs include migratory pastoralists found in Ranthambhore.&#13;
8.    Tourists and pilgrims. Although the most transitory of the stakeholders, tourists&#13;
and pilgrims nonetheless, constitute a large influential group in PAs, with services&#13;
provided by more permanent stakeholders such as state tourism departments, private&#13;
hotels, and temple complexes. In all the sites the majority of tourists are Indians. The large&#13;
numbers of pilgrims reflect the importance of PAs as sites of cultural and religious&#13;
significance.&#13;
9.    Researchers. Most of the sites have been or continue to be the subject of various&#13;
types of research by individuals and groups belonging to both NGOs and government.&#13;
This group of stakeholders has been characterized by varying degrees of success in&#13;
influencing policy. The variability is in part a function of the low priority given to wildlife&#13;
research in the forest departments and the even lower emphasis on socioeconomic topics.&#13;
Social and economic issues have, however, generated another important group of&#13;
stakeholders. These are primarily national and local NGOs, with opportunities to initiate&#13;
activities in and around PAs, and influence PA policies toward participation in&#13;
management and the welfare of indigenous tribal groups.&#13;

Tribals, Women, and Marginalized Groups&#13;
10.   Population. All seven project sites have populations of Scheduled Tribes and&#13;
Castes (see Table 2). The accuracy of data on the distribution of these groups is highly&#13;
variable, reflecting the variety of sources. Available data suggests that approximately 55&#13;
percent of the project population in seven sites belongs to Scheduled Castes and&#13;
Scheduled Tribes. In five of the sites (Buxa, Palamau, Pench, Periyar and Ranthambhore)&#13;
almost half or over half the project population belong to Scheduled Castes and Tribe. In&#13;
all sites, except Gir, the percentage of Scheduled Tribes in the project populations is&#13;
greater than that found across the respective states. This in part reflects the many tribes&#13;
basing their livelihoods on forest ecosystems.&#13;
11.   Tribals. A variety of tribal groups reside in and around the project sites; at least&#13;
32 Scheduled Tribes have been identified (Table 3). Although they pursue a range of&#13;
livelihood strategies, tribals in general have cultural, social, and economic systems closely&#13;
linked to their environments (often forest areas), and consequently have accumulated&#13;
extensive indigenous knowledge about ecosystems. Unfortunately, within PAs, tribals&#13;
have received little attention, and there is limited ethnographic information on their history&#13;
and cultural links with natural environments.&#13;
12.   PA Residents. Where there is habitation within PA boundaries, the population&#13;
generally belongs to scheduled tribes. Many of these PA residents have traditionally been&#13;
forest-dwellers highly dependent on forest resources. In Nagarhole, for example, the tribal&#13;
groups of Jenu-Kurbas (honey-gatherers), Betta-Kurbas, Hakki-Pikki (bird-trappers) and&#13;
Yeravas (swamp and paddy cultivators), have a long history of livelihoods based on NTFP&#13;
collection, hunting, and forest cultivation. Tribals with similar histories are found in&#13;
Periyar (Mannans and Paliyans). In central India, forest villages are typically inhabited by&#13;
tribals who have provided labor to forest departments, intercropped forest plantations and&#13;
collected NTFP and cultivating the land by inter-cropping. With the designation of forest&#13;
areas as PAs, access to forest resources and the demand for labor have dramatically&#13;
decreased. Tribals are therefore becoming integrated, with varying degrees of success, into&#13;
the larger commercial economy as they pursue supplemental and alternate incomes. Some,&#13;
such as the Mannans in Periyar, have had problems of seasonal poverty because of their&#13;
inability to manage large influxes of income from the periodic sale of cash crops. There are&#13;
a number of state and central government schemes to support tribal development including&#13;
departments of tribal welfare and the Jawahar Rojagar Yogana (JRY).&#13;
13.   Scheduled Castes. Another key group of vulnerable stakeholders in project sites&#13;
includes scheduled castes and poor people with limited ability to generate income. It is&#13;
difficult to generalize about states of poverty among scheduled castes, since there is&#13;
considerable variation in access to and ownership of resources. Some castes pursue&#13;
particular livelihoods such as blacksmith, tailor that can provide more than a subsistence&#13;
income. However, as a group they are socially marginalized, which limits their ability to&#13;
improve livelihoods without the benefit of the variety of government programs specifically&#13;
developed to support them. The category of poor people would typically include, in&#13;
addition to scheduled castes, the landless, sharecroppers, and marginal cultivators for&#13;
whom wage labor is an important source of income. Daily wages and benefits vary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  260                              Annex 18&#13;
considerably across the states; the highest was found in Kerala (over Rs 50), while in&#13;
Madhya Pradesh daily rates were Rs 10-12. Again a variety of government programs&#13;
exists to assist these groups; The programs are usually coordinated through local district&#13;
rural development agencies (DRDA).&#13;
14.   Women. As a group women are, perhaps, the most marginalized and vulnerable of&#13;
stakeholders in the project sites, particularly those of the scheduled tribes and castes.&#13;
Women are, for the most part, primary collectors of fuelwood, fodder, and NTFP for both&#13;
subsistence and supplemental income but are marginal participants in decisions governing&#13;
the management of these resources. They are significant contributors to the household&#13;
economy through agricultural wages and off-farm labor particularly in areas where male&#13;
labor has moved out. Generally, women have less access to education than men, which&#13;
limits their ability to participate in alternate income generation initiatives. Cultural&#13;
restrictions, especially in Gir and Ranthambhore in the north and west of the country,&#13;
further impede full and active participation by women in local economies and civic&#13;
institutions.&#13;

People - Protected Area Interactions&#13;
15.   Stakeholder Use of PAs. The major types of interaction between people and&#13;
parks are identified by PA in Table 4. The first seven interactions deal with stakeholder&#13;
use of PA resources for grazing, energy, income, cultural, pharmaceutical, food, and&#13;
cultural purposes. These uses can seriously affect biodiversity conservation; they can&#13;
reduce food and habitat for wild fauna, reduce plant regeneration, disturb the dynamics of&#13;
ecosystems, and cause the loss of critical species through over-harvesting, through the&#13;
introduction of exotic species, and through excess human waste. However, relatively&#13;
benign and even positive interactions can also exist when the level of resource use is low&#13;
or well managed; selective grazing, grass cutting, fuelwood harvesting or fires can&#13;
maintain habitat for herbivores and species requiring open canopy, bushy, or disturbed&#13;
conditions.&#13;
16.   Wildlife Damage. The last three areas of interaction identified on Table 4 concern&#13;
wildlife damage to cultivated crops, domestic livestock, and human life and limb---the&#13;
impact of the PA's resources on people. People ,in and around most PAs,, are providing&#13;
wildlife with as much as 35 percent of their food from private plant and animal resources.&#13;
In Gir National Park, approximately that amount of the Asiatic lion's food has been&#13;
documented as consisting of domestic cattle. Elsewhere, many villagers complain of a&#13;
similar percentage of their crop lost to wild herbivores, wild boar, monkeys, porcupines,&#13;
and other wildlife. An estimated 100 people a year are killed by tiger, elephant, and lion in&#13;
the project's seven sites, and many more are severely injured. Livestock loss and human&#13;
injury is partially compensated, but crop loss is generally uncompensated. The most&#13;
common complaint about PAs is: "You don't allow us to graze our animals on your land,&#13;
but you allow your animals to eat our fields and livestock."&#13;
17.   Cultural Resources. PA - people interactions also include cultural resources&#13;
established within park and sanctuary boundaries. Major temples in some sites are revered&#13;
and visited by people throughout the nation; smaller temples have regional importance,&#13;
and small shrines and sacred sites are important to the cultural heritage of local residents.&#13;
In addition, many tribal communities have retained strong cultural ties to forest-dwelling&#13;
and the access to specific plants and animals for ritual and social purposes. Appreciation of&#13;
natural heritage is also assuming increasing cultural importance for domestic and&#13;
international visitors. Along with the increasing need to manage environmental impacts&#13;
from these visitors and pilgrims there is also the potential for increasing local financial&#13;
benefits from their activities (see Working Paper on Ecotourism listed with other working&#13;
papers in Annex 22).&#13;
18.   Intensity. As shown in Table 4, the intensity of interaction differs considerably&#13;
between project sites. Wildlife crop depredation, grazing, and fuelwood collection are the&#13;
areas of greatest mutual impact throughout all project areas, with some significant&#13;
exceptions. Among the project sites, Ranthambhore appears to have the greatest intensity&#13;
of interaction across many different fronts, followed by Gir and Periyar. With over 30&#13;
million pilgrims and 250,000 tourists, Periyar is also the site of greatest visitor impact.&#13;
&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                264                             Annex 18&#13;
19.   Prevention of Stakeholder Uses. The establishment of PAs and prevention of&#13;
traditional stakeholder use can have significant negative impacts on different PA resource&#13;
users. Those traditionally highly dependent on the resources of the PA for their livelihood&#13;
have had their previous economic strategies severely disrupted by the new restrictions. As&#13;
shown in Table 5, these impacts are most significant for current PA residents, particularly&#13;
the mostly tribal populations without cultivable resources; but are also significant for&#13;
revenue village dwellers and migrant graziers on the periphery. Landless households and&#13;
women who depend on PA resources for both subsistence and income supplements are the&#13;
peripheral residents most affected by PA restrictions. During the project period, the most&#13;
affected groups within the PAs are more likely to opt for voluntary relocation.&#13;
20.   Decrease in Employment. In addition to reducing access to resources&#13;
establishment of the PA has often cut down employment in forestry operations that have&#13;
been curtailed or stopped. The impact of this reduction is most severe for forest&#13;
settlements that were established by the Forest Department precisely to provide accessible&#13;
labor for forestry operations, and for tribal settlements previously relocated within the PA.&#13;
21.   Quality of Interactions. The quality of interaction between the PA authorities&#13;
who regulate resource use and the various stakeholders with interests in the resource is an&#13;
important element in the people-park relationship and a critical variable in project success.&#13;
As agents of continuing restrictions on resource use, the PA authorities have generally had&#13;
antagonistic relationships with most stakeholding groups. Changing the quality of this&#13;
interaction is an important project objective.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               267                         Annex 18&#13;
Investment Assessment&#13;
22.   Indicative Investments. The specific village ecodevelopment investments cannot&#13;
be determined ahead of the ongoing microplanning process in which local communities&#13;
and PA authorities arrive at agreed annual investment programs. However, on the basis of&#13;
some participatory rural appraisal (PRA) planning) for each site the indicative planning&#13;
process has identified the most likely investments to be selected. In Table 6, proposed&#13;
indicative investments have been categorized according to the type and objectives of&#13;
mutual interaction they are designed to address.&#13;
23.   Incentives. The specific objectives are to decrease threats to the PA's biodiversity&#13;
by providing incentives for alternative behaviors. These incentives include a combination&#13;
of the following:&#13;
(a)   Direct substitutes for particular PA resources&#13;
(b)   Alternative sources of income for a particular PA resource use&#13;
(c)   Village projects and conservation education to increased understanding and&#13;
cooperation in biodiversity conservation by generating good will.&#13;
24.   Each of these sets of proposed investments is related to the goal of conserving&#13;
biodiversity; but the direct linkage -- especially for (b) and (c)-- will depend on specific&#13;
agreements on behavior change negotiated during the microplanning process (see Annex&#13;
8).&#13;
25.   Social Impacts. The large menu of indicative investments will have varying&#13;
degrees of linkage to biodiversity conservation, so the specific social impacts, especially&#13;
on vulnerable groups, will vary widely by investment and the manner in which it is&#13;
implemented (see below). Each proposed investment has an accompanying set of issues&#13;
that will undergo site and community-specific feasibility analysis during the microplanning&#13;
process (see Annex 8). Table 6, notes some observations on these issues under the&#13;
heading of "Feasibility Comments". In general, joint forest and PA management are likely&#13;
to provide the most direct linkage and most positive social impact if carried out through&#13;
the participatory approach now being developed elsewhere in India. Soil and water&#13;
conservation structures, unless sought by communities for direct benefits, seldom attract&#13;
community interest, and thus may not provide strong motivation for behavior change.&#13;
Alternative income sources, if directly linked to conservation through village agreements&#13;
and targeted to resource users, can provide long-term solutions to overuse of PA&#13;
resources. However, many of these income-generating projects require technical expertise&#13;
and supporting investments with which forest departments have little experience and that&#13;
are unlikely to be available from existing sources&#13;
26.   Issues. A wide variety of technical and social issues is associated with each of the&#13;
possible investments. The project thus embodies a leaming process for all key actors: the&#13;
forest department, the village communities, and the supporting NGOs. The GOI and&#13;
NGOs involved on a country-wide basis will promote opportunities for PAs to share&#13;
knowledge; thus providing for continuous monitoring and helping PAs avoid repeating&#13;
each others' mistakes.&#13;

Impacts on Tribals, Poor, and Women&#13;
27.    Benefits. By its focus on reducing negative interaction between people and PAs,&#13;
the project design anticipates benefits from development and support of livelihood&#13;
strategies less dependent on PA resources. Benefits for tribals, women, and other&#13;
marginalized groups are likely to derive from employment in a variety of activities,&#13;
operation of micro-enterprises (poultry, handicrafts, etc.), expenditure reduction through&#13;
efficient use of natural resources (e.g., energy conservation with improved stoves), and&#13;
increased crop and livestock production (see Tables 7 &amp; 8). Further benefits may include&#13;
improved infrastructure and such facilities as drinking water. By addressing areas of&#13;
greatest friction between PA and stakeholders (see Table 6) the project should also&#13;
improve relationships between stakeholders, particularly between PA officials and local&#13;
people.&#13;
28.    Negative Effects of Village Ecodevelopment. Village ecodevelopment activities&#13;
are, however, equally likely to generate negative effects on both biodiversity conservation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               270                          Annex 18&#13;
and the socioeconomic condition of those concerned. Livelihood strategies that reduce&#13;
dependency on forest resources will inevitably affect the extent and type of indigenous&#13;
knowledge retained and used by those groups having close cultural links with forest&#13;
ecosystems. For example, forestry plantations will not provide the equivalent variety of&#13;
species found in forest areas and widely used for food and for income generation and&#13;
medicinal purposes by tribals and women (Ranthambhore Foundation, 1994). Similarly,&#13;
NTFP cultivation may concentrate on a few species of commercial value rather than a&#13;
variety serving a range of household needs.&#13;
29.   Effects of Park Management on Marginal Groups. Marginal groups are also&#13;
likely to be affected by the range of park management activities proposed in the project.&#13;
Survey and demarcation activities could result in either including or excluding tribal&#13;
settlements from PA boundaries and generating questions for future relocation policies.&#13;
Other activities such as the construction of habitat management structures (e.g., watch-&#13;
towers) may curtail informal access to forest resources as policing becomes more&#13;
effective. Habitat enrichment activities may similarly restrict access to grazing and NTFP&#13;
as PA authorities concentrate on managing forest areas for increased biodiversity.&#13;
30.   Effects of Park Management on Women. Where the sale of firewood has been&#13;
an important source of income (Periyar, Ranthambhore), especially for women, energy&#13;
conservation may result in decreased income and some loss of financial independence.&#13;
Livestock improvement through better breeds and stall-feeding may increase the workload&#13;
for fodder-collectors, often women, when previously animals were left to graze. Similarly,&#13;
more intensive crop production such as the cultivation of cash crops may immediately&#13;
increase workloads for cultivators, who again are likely to be women. Women may also&#13;
face increased workloads and responsibilities across the range of investments if options are&#13;
decided without their active participation.&#13;
31.   Poor Access to Benefits. There are certain categories of investments that are&#13;
unlikely to produce benefits for some groups. Investments in agricultural improvements&#13;
(including livestock) and in soil and water conservation have little to offer marginal and&#13;
other types of cultivators, and even less to offer the landless. Cultivators such as those in&#13;
forest villages may be unwilling or even unable to invest in land improvement given their&#13;
uncertain land tenure arrangements (e.g., leases on which credit is unavailable as in Gir,&#13;
Buxa, Nagarhole, and Periyar). Under such circumstances landowners with larger, secure&#13;
holdings may accumulate any benefits and force those with less resources into more&#13;
marginal and subsistence livelihoods. For PA residents, particularly tribals, alternate&#13;
sources of natural resources (for example, plantations, and NTFP cultivation) are not&#13;
possible given the terms of the Wildlife Act and the conversion of declared sanctuaries&#13;
into notified national parks.&#13;
32.   Local Financial Management Capability. Alternate income generation and&#13;
increased employment may create problems for groups, such as tribal PA residents who&#13;
have little education and experience with financial management, as they join the larger&#13;
commercial economy. Tribals in Periyar experience periods of poverty during the year,&#13;
despite reasonable annual incomes, due to an inability to manage large cash influxes from&#13;
cash crops. Current tourism strategies may generate hostile reactions from local people,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                271                          Annex 18&#13;
since at present they receive little benefit from the increasing numbers of visitors, and&#13;
would be unlikely to receive significantly more in the future unless policies change.&#13;
33.   Targeting. Some PA authorities from the project sites have considered how to&#13;
address specifically the needs and problems of vulnerable groups such as tribals, women,&#13;
and the poor. On the basis of PRA findings during project preparation, indicative project&#13;
investments are set to cover particular activities for target groups, general activities more&#13;
likely to be taken up by vulnerable groups, and subsidies. Examples of the first can be&#13;
found in Buxa where women have been tentatively targeted for participation in mushroom&#13;
cultivation (120 women), cottage industries (270) bee-keeping, farm forestry (160 landless&#13;
and poor women) and intercropping (160). In Palamau, sewing (100) and poultry rearing&#13;
(250) have specific female target populations, while Nagarhole has identified village forest&#13;
nurseries (125) for female participation. Tribal populations have been targeted with pig-&#13;
rearing in Nagarhole and Palamau, NTFP production and sale in Buxa, and fishing in&#13;
Periyar. In Palamau indicative investments in smithy activities and carpentry are intended&#13;
to be of direct benefit to scheduled castes. All the indicative ecodevelopment plans have&#13;
outlined the number of person-days of employment anticipated directly from possible&#13;
investments, but there is no indication of future employment resulting from activities such&#13;
as successful micro-enterprises and expanded agricultural production.&#13;
34.   Self Targeting. General activities more likely to be taken up by vulnerable groups&#13;
fall under a strategy of self-targeting. Typically, these activities include the generation of&#13;
wage labor and other employment opportunities that are primarily taken up by the poor&#13;
and landless. An example of self-targeting would be the collection and processing of low&#13;
value NTFPs that would be taken up by low income and marginal groups; an example of&#13;
this would be the collection and preparation of sal-leaf plates, which is primarily carried&#13;
out by women.&#13;
35.   Subsidies cover various investment categories. In Buxa saplings are intended to be&#13;
sold at 50 percent subsidy to village members of forest protection and ecodevelopment&#13;
committees. Cattle improvement in Palamau incorporates a subsidy of 25 percent when&#13;
inferior cattle are exchanged for improved animals. In many existing rural development&#13;
programs, these subsidies are further adjusted according to social and economic status;&#13;
For example, scheduled castes and tribes and households below the poverty line receive&#13;
significantly greater subsidies than less vulnerable groups.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report               276                         Annex 18&#13;
37.   Microplanning. The tools and processes of microplanning designed to alleviate&#13;
potential negative impacts are discussed in more detail in Annex 8. Feasibility analysis&#13;
across the range of possibilities for village ecodevelopment investments (Annexes 7 and 8)&#13;
will be a critical element in the planning process. To ensure that village ecodevelopment is&#13;
participatory and that agreements between parties are indeed reciprocal, tribal groups, the&#13;
poor, and women will have to be represented in decision-making structures and assisted by&#13;
NGOs in making their voices heard. PA staff at all levels will have to be sensitive to the&#13;
range of social issues likely to influence the process. SFDs have been asked to prepare&#13;
draft government orders that would address, among other issues, the establishment and&#13;
responsibilities of village-level ecodevelopment committees (see Annex 8).&#13;
38.   Role of NGOs. NGOs will have a critical role to play in the microplanning and&#13;
implementation process. Frequently, NGOs have entered the arena of PA management&#13;
through activities to alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods of populations in and&#13;
around PAs (e.g. MYRADA in Nagarhole, Peermade in Periyar, AKRSP in Gir and CEE&#13;
in Ranthambhore). Their experience and approach will be a necessary addition to the&#13;
efforts of PA authorities and bring to the project enhanced social skills and sensitivities.&#13;
Furthermore, as non-government institutions, these organizations will enhance the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation processes. The project has included funds to contract NGOs&#13;
and increase their capacity through training to participate effectively in village&#13;
ecodevelopment activities.&#13;
39.   Training. Quality training, particularly for vulnerable groups, will be vital to the&#13;
success of village ecodevelopment investments since the access of these groups to&#13;
education and exposure to large-scale economic forces are limited. This training should&#13;
equip such groups with the skills and knowledge needed to operate in new and changing&#13;
economic environments. With appropriate microplanning and NGO participation it is more&#13;
likely that options are identified and developed that are culturally appropriate and socially&#13;
acceptable, and thus more likely to succeed. The project also realizes the value of research&#13;
in informing policy on the management of interaction between people and PAs and has&#13;
included support for socioeconomic studies.&#13;
40.   Employment. There is also considerable opportunity and need to increase&#13;
numbers of vulnerable groups employed by PA authorities at all levels. In some states,&#13;
forest departments with sufficient commitment have shown that they can change&#13;
recruitment policies to ensure that women and tribals are hired as forest guards, rangers,&#13;
extension agents, etc. In Periyar, for example, park management activities include the&#13;
hiring of tribals and women as conservation assistants. Particularly where distrust is great,&#13;
languages different, or gender restrictions high, such recruitment will be critical in bridging&#13;
the social distances that currently impede the full participation of women, tribals, and the&#13;
poor.&#13;
Other Key Social Issues&#13;
41.   Overview. As with any complex participatory project, additional important social&#13;
issues will be critical to project success at each site. This includes issues related to&#13;
community participation and social organization, institutional support for community-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               277                         Annex 18&#13;
based programs, and any voluntary relocation, land and resource tenure regimes, the&#13;
policy environment, etc.&#13;
42.   Community Participation. Indigenous forms of social organization, decision-&#13;
making and conflict resolution differ substantially between and within different social&#13;
groups. For example, some groups interviewed during preappraisal indicated that major&#13;
decisions such as relocation, change in grazing patterns, etc. were only made on a group&#13;
basis to which every member felt bound. In other cases, households followed more&#13;
individualistic decision-making strategies. The inclusion of contract sociologists in the&#13;
project should help sensitize PA authorities and NGOs to these social and cultural realities&#13;
and assist them in adjusting their PRA and microplanning strategies. Specialized support in&#13;
social assessment and participatory planning, serving all seven project sites, would provide&#13;
additional guidance.&#13;
43.   Voluntary Relocation. In four of the project sites voluntary relocation is likely to&#13;
take place during the project period and will have significant impacts on those who are&#13;
relocated (see Table 1). These impacts will have economic, social, and cultural dimensions&#13;
and will depend heavily on how such relocation is carried out. The project has developed&#13;
an agreed policy for voluntary relocation (see Annex 20). PA authorities would develop&#13;
participatory relocation plans in response to the wishes of local people and in accordance&#13;
with the guidance contained in the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 and recent GOI&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
44.   Tenure Within PAs. A wide array of tenure patterns are also found at each site,&#13;
particularly for people living within PA boundaries. Some groups of tribal inhabitants&#13;
(Nagarhole) do not have any tenure rights recognized by the forest department; some have&#13;
annual leasehold rights to limited cultivation (frequently not renewed) but no rights over&#13;
forest products (i.e., most forest settlements); some have rights to certain limited non-&#13;
timber forest products, but no rights to graze (i.e., tribals in Periyar); some have rights to&#13;
residence and grazing, but no rights to NTFP (i.e., Maldharis in Gir); some have rights to&#13;
residence, but no rights to any forest produce (i.e., most temple complexes). In many&#13;
cases where rights are not recognized, customary usage is still tolerated and even explicitly&#13;
allowed (i.e., grazing in parts of Gir and Ranthambhore). In many cases, these rights and&#13;
concessions are being progressively diminished as the more flexible sanctuary designations&#13;
are replaced by national park notification and enforcement increases.&#13;
45.   Tenure Outside PAs. Outside PA boundaries, tenure issues are also varied. Lands&#13;
used for community grazing and NTFP collection (especially fuelwood), are variously&#13;
under the legal authority of the panchayats, the revenue department, the forest&#13;
department, private corporations (e.g. tea estates), or individual households. Frequently,&#13;
the usage of these lands and their legal ownership are at variance and overlapping tenure&#13;
claims common. Even legal ownership is often a subject of dispute between different&#13;
agencies and users. Temporal variations can also occur when private lands change to&#13;
common property during fallow seasons of collective grazing. Tenancy and various forms&#13;
of resource use by landless households provide an additional dimension to the complicated&#13;
tenure patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                278                          Annex 18&#13;
46.   Security of Tenure. Tenure issues are central to the project since much of its&#13;
thrust is to negotiate a further reduction---or acceptance of the already instituted&#13;
reduction---in usage of PA resources . To the extent that the microplanning process is able&#13;
to build a consensus between each of the stakeholders and tenure claimants, project&#13;
investments can be carried out with a reasonable degree of tenurial security. However,&#13;
there will be situations in which measures to increase tenurial security will be needed to&#13;
maintain the motivation of stakeholders. Such measures would include issuing government&#13;
orders on resource use rights; transferring forest settlements to revenue village&#13;
administration; standing guarantee for credit collateral; and negotiating agreements for&#13;
benefit sharing. To ensure that these tenurial issues are adequately addressed, it will be&#13;
important to carry out the planned social science research program .&#13;
47.   Participation and Learning. The extent to which these impacts will be positive&#13;
will depend on the extent to which the participatory microplanning and implementing&#13;
process is really participatory (See Annex 8). In addition, positive outcome will depend on&#13;
the adoption of a continuing learning process, involving all project stakeholders through&#13;
both formal studies and monitoring; perhaps even more important, it will depend on a&#13;
willingness to trust local people and their knowledge and to allow them to learn through&#13;
their own failures. The tools to allow local communities to influence the direction of PA&#13;
management significantly are built into this project to a far greater degree than normally&#13;
found in the forestry or environment sector. Ideally, the ultimate outcome will be largely&#13;
up to local communities.&#13;

Annex 20: People in the PAs and Voluntary Relocation&#13;
1.    Current Situation. All protected areas (PAs) have people living within the PA&#13;
boundaries (see Annex 6 Table 2). Most live in areas where human settlement is allowed.&#13;
During the past few decades, the creation of the PAs has sometimes caused people living&#13;
in the PAs to lose access to resources and precipitated resettlement of tribal people in&#13;
forest villages in ways that involved little or no participatory decision-making. The project&#13;
itself would not cause further loss of living standards; rather, it would help to address and&#13;
ameliorate existing conditions where people have already experienced losses and where,&#13;
without the project, people would face very limited and bleak options. At the same time,&#13;
population pressures are adversely affecting PA conservation. To address and ameliorate&#13;
existing conditions, state forest departments (SFDs) and some PA residents have started&#13;
discussions on the possibility of participatory, voluntary relocation. The Project&#13;
Preparation Facility supported some preliminary reviews by NGOs of these discussions.&#13;
The discussions and NGO reviews indicate a strong demand for relocation from some&#13;
households, but the number of potential participants is not yet clear. Initial impressions&#13;
indicate that some 1-4 percent of the 87,000 people living within the PAs would be&#13;
interested in participating in resettlement.&#13;
2.    Definition of "Voluntary". The project would provide support on an&#13;
experimental basis for a participatory process to plan and implement "voluntary&#13;
relocation". Relocation under the project would be "voluntary" in the sense that it would&#13;
be driven by the wishes of each local household. Planning would take place in the context&#13;
of options that would not involve relocation. The project would draw on lessons of best&#13;
practice that are outlined in Bank's Operational Directives on Involuntary Resettlement&#13;
and Indigenous People. Voluntary relocation does not require strict scheduling because it&#13;
is driven by the wishes of local people rather than by an external "event" (which is what&#13;
drives involuntary resettlement). Voluntary relocation under the project would not be&#13;
timebound; there was no need to prepare a resettlement plan prior to appraisal. During the&#13;
project, people may move at different times -- at their own pace. Not all households in a&#13;
community may move. In some cases, partial and/or gradual relocation may be subject to&#13;
environmental considerations outlined below in paragraph 6. However, the success of the&#13;
project does not depend on timebound or complete evacuation of people from PAs.&#13;
Indeed a major objective is to foster the cooperation of people who would not be moving.&#13;
Voluntary relocation would be consistent with the legal covenant that the project project&#13;
would not erode the customary tenure rights of tribals living within the protected areas.&#13;
3.    Reasons to Avoid Involuntary Resettlement. Involuntary resettlement would:&#13;
(a)   Be unnecessary on ecological grounds, or on other grounds related to&#13;
protected area management or project activities during the project period&#13;
(b)   Conflict with the project strategy of reducing discord and increasing&#13;
collaboration between protected areas and local people&#13;
(c)   Risk inadvertent erosion of customary land rights of indigenous people&#13;
living within the protected areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               282                            Annex 20&#13;
(d)   Conflict with usual Bank practice not to involuntarily resettle tribals from&#13;
protected areas.&#13;
4.    Relocation Strategy. The project's people-driven, participatory approach to&#13;
relocation would provide win-win solutions to problems faced by local people and PAs&#13;
and establish a model approach applicable to other PAs throughout India. This strategy&#13;
would enable the project to meet the demands of local people who are eager to move.&#13;
Relocation would be to lands on the periphery of the PAs, rather than to distant lands and&#13;
there would be no involuntary relocation. All relocation planning and implementation&#13;
associated with PA management or other project objectives, regardless of financing,&#13;
would be consistent with Bank guidelines, and implementation would require prior Bank&#13;
approval. The project would help state and national governments to carefully plan and&#13;
implement relocation activities so that they do not inadvertently cause long-term hardship,&#13;
impoverishment, and environmental damage. It would provide an incentive-based&#13;
mechanism to reduce population pressures. The strategy would also support options for&#13;
people in the PAs not wishing to relocate.&#13;
5.    Documenting Voluntary Nature of Relocation. The microplanning support&#13;
teams of PA personnel, collaborating NGOs, and villagers, with the support of relocation&#13;
specialists, would facilitate the consultation and decision making on relocation. In these&#13;
cases, microplanning would provide an opportunity for local people to consider the&#13;
relocation option, and if they wished, to plan the relocation activities. The support teams&#13;
would carefully document the participatory planning process and content of local people's&#13;
decisions on relocation. For relocation to proceed, this documentation would need to&#13;
include unambiguous confirmation that decisions on relocation met the definition of&#13;
"voluntary" outlined in paragraph 2 above. Both the independent review and the Bank&#13;
review of relocation plans would give close attention to this documentation.&#13;
6.    Concerns Involving Gradual and/or Partial Relocation. Forest Departments&#13;
have several concerns about the potential risks of gradual and/or partial relocation, e.g.,&#13;
enlarged areas of human habitation in the vicinity of the PAs, increased transit of people&#13;
between old and new communities, sustainability of groups decisions to relocate, etc. The&#13;
consultation process on voluntary relocation would need to consider and address these&#13;
concerns wherever they exist. Possible outcomes of such consideration would vary by site&#13;
and might include: (i) consensus decisions by communities to move together at one time,&#13;
(ii) reciprocal commitments by existing and/or relocated communities that would address&#13;
potential adverse impacts on biodiversity (e.g., consolidation of holdings within existing&#13;
community), (iii) decisions by PA managers to not support relocation because of potential&#13;
adverse impacts, or (iv) development of a relocation package so desirable that it would&#13;
have a high likelihood of enticing additional participation in the near future.&#13;
7.    Support for Relocation. The funds provided for voluntary relocation would be&#13;
additional to standard GOI and state allocations, and would be used to develop&#13;
participatory operational plans consistent with GOI and IDA guidelines. They would aid&#13;
households in the transitional period, provide investment funds for alternative livelihoods,&#13;
provide implementation support services, and support measures fostering cultural&#13;
continuity. Because the number of potential participants is not clear, project cost estimates&#13;
for relocation are extremely tentative. The project costs for relocation would be subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 283                             Annex 20&#13;
major revision at the mid-project review, after consultation with potential participants&#13;
(consistent with Bank standards) has taken place.&#13;
8.    Support for Those Electing to Stay During Project Period. The project would&#13;
include special efforts to identify and provide village ecodevelopment investments for&#13;
people who do not wish to relocate during the project period. The eligibility criteria for&#13;
village ecodevelopment investments (see Annex 8) would limit the range of options&#13;
available to many of the people living within the PAs. Some of the people resident in the&#13;
PAs are non-cultivating tribals without documented land titles and in these cases land&#13;
based investments would usually not be possible Examples of possible investments for&#13;
these people include training and equipment for job and livelihood opportunities related to&#13;
contractual PA management activities and ecotourism enterprises. People living within the&#13;
PAs have felt the burden of PA establishment most heavily. It is important to not exclude&#13;
these people from access to village ecodevelopment support, and to carefully consider&#13;
their special situation during the negotiation of the reciprocal commitments. Although the&#13;
value of village ecodevelopment investment provided to people remaining within the PA&#13;
would be equivalent to those living in the periphery, in terms of project costs it would&#13;
amount to only a fraction of the support provided to people choosing to relocate.&#13;
9.    Legal Setting. Most people living within the PAs reside in (a) legally excluded&#13;
enclaves or (b) forest villages within parts of the PAs that are legally classified as&#13;
sanctuaries or forest reserves. Section 24 (2) (c) of the Wildlife Act permits "the&#13;
continuance of any right of any person in or over any land within the limits of the&#13;
sanctuary", and similar legal provisions allowing the continuation of rights exist for forest&#13;
reserves. In the Palamau Tiger Reserve, 630 people live in forest villages within a&#13;
sanctuary, in an area that is an "intended national park". According to Section 35 (4) (a)&#13;
of the Wildlife Act, after a declaring that it intends to establish a national park in a specific&#13;
area, the Government would notify the area as a national park after "all claims ..... have&#13;
been disposed of by the State Government". Hence national park notification depends&#13;
upon a resolution of rights which is not time-bound. In Palamau, the state government has&#13;
not decided how it will resolve the claims nor does has it set a deadline for this resolution&#13;
of claims and the legal notification. According to section 35 (3) and (5) of the Wildlife&#13;
Act, once a national park has received notification, alteration of boundaries requires a&#13;
resolution of the state legislature, and no continuance of rights over land within the park is&#13;
allowed In Nagarhole National Park, 7,100 people live in forest villages within a notified&#13;
national park and 1,200 people in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve live "on the boundary" of&#13;
a notified national park.&#13;
10.   Government Approach. While legally state governments cannot give permission&#13;
for people to continue to live within a notified national park, in practice, most state&#13;
governments have addressed the problem of resident communities pragmatically. They&#13;
have not enforced the full rigor of the law because it would be socially and politically&#13;
difficult. During the past decade, state governments with people in intended and notified&#13;
national parks and core parts of sanctuaries have provided incentives for people to move&#13;
to the buffer or peripheral areas of the PAs. Incentives have included support for housing,&#13;
village infrastructure, land and irrigation. However, these past initiatives have not&#13;
necessarily been "voluntary" according to the definition outlined in paragraph 2 above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report              284                          Annex 20&#13;
Project preparation involved extensive dialogue on the opportunity the project provides to&#13;
develop a participatory, voluntary approach. Government officials have agreed to use the&#13;
project to experiment with this approach.&#13;
11.   Build on Established Strategy. Recent Bank-financed state forestry projects in&#13;
India have established a strategy that there would be no involuntary relocation of people in&#13;
the PA undertaken by SFDs. The project would build upon this strategy and actively&#13;
develop a program of participatory, voluntary relocation that could serve as a model for&#13;
other PAs. In addition to developing a model program of voluntary relocation, the project&#13;
would address issues of people in PAs under a program to strengthen PA management&#13;
plans, which would consider possible rationalization of PA boundaries (see Annex 7), and&#13;
under the research program (see Annex 10). For example, some of the people within&#13;
Nagarhole live on a periphery that might be excluded from the park by redefinition of&#13;
boundaries, and the PA management planning and research activities would consider the&#13;
environmental feasibility of this option.&#13;
12.   The following assurances have been obtained from the GOI and participating&#13;
states and were reconfirmed during negotiations: that the GOSs would:&#13;
(a)   In pursusing the objectives of the Project, not carry out any involuntary&#13;
resettlement for any people resident within the PAs&#13;
(b)   Ensure that any proposals for voluntary relocation would be prepared and&#13;
implemented in accordance with criteria agreed with IDA and after prior&#13;
approval of IDA&#13;
(c)   For people who opt to remain in the PAs, prepare an indicative list of&#13;
appropriate village ecodevelopment investments acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
which meets project criteria, and include these people in the village&#13;
ecodevelopment program&#13;
(d)   Adopt an explicit strategy and plan for sustainable encroachment control&#13;
acceptable to IDA before making proposals for programs of voluntary&#13;
relocation.&#13;
Non-project activities, including those related to resettlement, would be subject to the&#13;
regional impacts covenant (see paragraph 17 below).&#13;
13.   Criteria. The proposals would follow the strategy and guidelines outlined in this&#13;
Annex, including&#13;
(a)   Consistency with the project interpretation of "voluntary"&#13;
(b)   Consistency with the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 (Indigenous&#13;
People) prior to execution&#13;
(c)   Consistency with best practice outlined in the Bank's Operational Directive&#13;
4.30 (Involuntary Resettlement) prior to execution&#13;
(d)   Development of participatory operational plans with the assistance of&#13;
independent NGOs or consultants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               285                            Annex 20&#13;
(e)   Prior to execution, review of plans by the Bank on a case-by-case basis, to&#13;
ensure consistency with strategy and guidelines outlined in this Annex&#13;
(f)    Prior to execution, correction of any inconsistencies in plans identified by&#13;
Bank review&#13;
(g)   Inclusion of an independent program to monitor voluntary relocation&#13;
(h)   Correction of problems identified by monitoring&#13;
(i)    Documentation of conformity with the above points by provision of&#13;
transparent, credible, and verifiable information.&#13;
Execution of relocation would include proceeding with any land acquisition already&#13;
underway and the initiation of any new land acquisition.&#13;
14.   The state governments confirmed during appraisal and again at negotiations that&#13;
since the November 1994 preappraisal, they have not acquired land from current residents&#13;
within the project PAs, provided compensation to them, nor built housing for them, or&#13;
otherwise carried out activities that could be considered implementation of a resettlement&#13;
plan that has not been reviewed and approved by the Bank. The Bank decision to exclude&#13;
the Similipal Tiger Reserve from the project demonstrates the importance that the Bank&#13;
attaches to these assurances.&#13;
15.   Investment in Support of Voluntary Relocation. In providing supplementary&#13;
support for voluntary relocation from core to periphery areas the project would enable&#13;
states to develop model policies in accordance with recent GOI guidelines and Bank ODs&#13;
for assisting families desiring to move. It is currently anticipated that Buxa, Gir,&#13;
Nagarhole, and Ranthambhore would use these funds, but Palamau and Periyar could also&#13;
participate if they wished. These funds, which would be additional to GOI and state&#13;
allocations, would be used to:&#13;
(a)   Develop participatory operational plans with the help of qualified NGOs or&#13;
consultants&#13;
(b)   Provide additional funds to support households in maintaining their&#13;
livelihoods in the transitional period (3 years) through employment, asset&#13;
creation, and training&#13;
(c)    Support NGO services carrying out voluntary relocation activities&#13;
(d)   Maintain cultural continuity by modest support of such actions as&#13;
relocation of tribal shrines and community activity centers, cultural events,&#13;
passing on of indigenous knowledge, etc.&#13;
(e)   Provide consultancy on plan assessment.&#13;
&#13;

becn undcr discussion, but only a portion of the total numbcrs are likelN to&#13;
participate.&#13;
16.    Government and Private Colonies. Government and private colonies within PAs&#13;
include major installations such as hydropower, irrigation, and electricity boards, tourism&#13;
complexes, railway complexes, mines, industries, and places of religious importance. The&#13;
project design incorporates PA management planning activities to determine impact of&#13;
such installations on biodiversity and the formulation of policies and agreements to&#13;
mitigate serious disturbances. In the case of government enclosures, with their large&#13;
groups of staff and laborers, it will be useful to assess if the numbers resident within the&#13;
PA boundaries are necessary, and whether there is scope to negotiate with the relevant&#13;
entities their reduction or relocation.&#13;
1 7.    Encroachment Control. With or without proposals for voluntary relocation, state&#13;
governments would take steps to ensure that activities outside the PA would not&#13;
undermine effective encroachment control.&#13;
1 8.    Regional Impacts. The project strategy for relocation would not necessarily apply&#13;
to non project activities (e.g., Kutku irrigation dam in Bihar, see Annex 6). To address this&#13;
type of situation, assurances were obtained at negotiations that activities outside the&#13;
scope of the project would not undermine effective biodiversity conservation within the&#13;
project PAs, and would not undermine the implementation of the ecodevelopment strategy&#13;
in and around the PAs (see Annex 7).&#13;
1 9    Operational Directive on Involuntary Resettlement. The Operational Directive&#13;
on Involuntary Resettlement (4.30) provides useful guidelines and principles to be&#13;
followed in any proposals for resettlement, even if this is voluntary. Examples of these&#13;
O. D. recommendations include, itier alia,:&#13;
(a)    The preparation of a relocation plan that attempts to improve or at least&#13;
restore living standards, earning capacity and production levels of the&#13;
displaced people: It should include provision to&#13;
(i)    assist the displaced people in the relocation move and provide&#13;
support during the transition period in the new site&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  287                              Annex 20&#13;
(ii)   assist the displaced people in their efforts to improve their former&#13;
living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or&#13;
at least to restore them. The project has provided for supplementary&#13;
support in order to improve their incomes and resources&#13;
(b)    Involving both settlers and hosts in resettlement activities. In designing the&#13;
relocation plan, special emphasis would be placed on:&#13;
(i)    community participation in planning and implementing it&#13;
(ii)   enabling resettlers to maintain cultural continuity through building&#13;
on existing social and cultural institutions. The project provides for&#13;
supplementary measures to assist community in relocating cultural&#13;
structures and maintaining desired cultural traditions&#13;
(iii)   measures to integrate re-settlers socially and economically into host&#13;
communities so as to minimize adverse impacts on the host&#13;
communities, if applicable&#13;
(c)    Improve or restore economic base: Resettlement plans should be based on&#13;
a strategy to improve or at least restore the economic base for those&#13;
relocated. The content of the resettlement plans, should normally include a&#13;
statement of objectives and policies and other features&#13;
(d)    Valuation and compensation for land and other assets affected by the&#13;
project. Prior to relocation, people would be provided a compensation&#13;
package of support for housing, village infrastructure, land, and irrigation&#13;
to compensate for lost assets, equivalent to full replacement value of all&#13;
assets to be foregone, including usufruct and customary tenure.&#13;
Compensation would be facilitated by:&#13;
(i)    paying special attention to the adequacy of legal arrangements&#13;
concerning land title, registration, and site occupation to ensure&#13;
secure rights (e.g., leasehold, full title), to ensure that security of&#13;
tenure is at least equivalent to what would be forgone, and to&#13;
ensure that there is no erosion of customary tenure of tribals&#13;
(ii)   publicizing among affected people to be displaced the laws and&#13;
regulations governing relocation and compensation&#13;
(iii)   development of mechanisms to prevent illegal encroachers to take&#13;
advantage of such benefits and to prevent nonresidents moving into&#13;
those areas vacated&#13;
(iv)   establishment of a simple grievance mechanism to resolve any&#13;
disputes that may arise.&#13;
20.   Operational Directive on Indigenous People. The objective of the Operational&#13;
Directive on Indigenous People (4.20) is to ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer&#13;
adverse effects during development processes and that the social and economic benefits&#13;
they receive are in harmony with their cultural preferences. It is based on a strategy of&#13;
informed participation of affected indigenous peoples through methods such as direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                    288                               Annex 20&#13;
consultation, incorporation of indigenous knowledge into the project, and use of&#13;

Annex 21: Economic Analysis&#13;
Overall Benefits&#13;
1.    The project would conserve globally significant biodiversity in the seven PAs and&#13;
develop capacity for increased conservation in the future. The project would support&#13;
mutually dependent activities that in combination would reduce negative environmental&#13;
impacts of local people on biodiversity, and increase protection of biodiversity in the PAs.&#13;
In the project areas, over the long term, the project would help to slow, halt, or possibly&#13;
even reverse the current declines in:&#13;
(a)   the area and degree of ecosystem richness, complexity, and diversity&#13;
(b)   the presence, productivity, and abundance of significant species&#13;
(c)   the extent of regional connectivity&#13;
(d)   the extent of nutrient recycling and rate of regeneration&#13;
(e)   the control of weeds and exotic species.&#13;
The project would also increase the capacity of government officials to manage PAs&#13;
effectively, addressing not only internal operations but also proposed and existing&#13;
periphery and regional activities that impact the PAs. It would increase the capacity of&#13;
local communities to play a positive role in PA management. The project would also&#13;
increase the support of local people for PA conservation. It would develop stakeholder&#13;
consensus on conservation-related strategies. The project would create processes and&#13;
organizational frameworks that could be expanded to other ecologically significant areas.&#13;
In addition to these overall benefits that derive from the total package, each project&#13;
component would produce specific outputs and benefits described below.&#13;
Outputs from Improved PA Management&#13;
2     Improving PA Planning Processes and Building Capacity (averaging&#13;
US$1 50,000 base costs per PA). Strengthening of PA management skills and the regional&#13;
planning and regulation activities would:&#13;
(a)   produce a comprehensive and carefully designed work program for&#13;
protecting and managing ecosystems and habitats of the project PAs&#13;
covering the last three years of the program&#13;
(b)   broaden the focus of existing PA management planning capacity to more&#13;
comprehensively cover ecological considerations (e.g., boundaries, buffers,&#13;
and ecosystems), PA-related concerns of local people, and strategies for&#13;
relevant government programs and policies (e.g., research, environmental&#13;
education, ecotourism)&#13;
(c)   ensure compliance with the project covenant that activities outside the&#13;
scope of the project would not undermine effective biodiversity&#13;
conservation in the project PAs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               292                           Annex 21&#13;
(d)   develop a replicable model for more effectively integrating PA concerns&#13;
into regional planning and regulation processes.&#13;
3.    Protecting and Managing Ecosystems and Habitats (averaging US$1,680,000&#13;
base costs per PA) would:&#13;
(a)   restore ecosystem and habitat through works (e.g., weed eradication, soil&#13;
and water conservation, domestic/exotic animal controls), both those&#13;
needed on an urgent basis during the first two years of the project, and&#13;
those identified through the updated PA management plans for the last&#13;
three years of the project, providing the foundation for normal plant and&#13;
animal succession in the future&#13;
(b)   improve fire control, increase the effectiveness of anti-poaching efforts,&#13;
reduce the extent to which wild animals stray out of the PA&#13;
(c)   reduce the negative impacts of visitors, in accordance with&#13;
recommendations of ecological research and ecotourism strategies&#13;
(d)   increase employment and byproduct sharing opportunities for local people&#13;
in PA management activities&#13;
4.    Upgrading PA Amenities for Field Staff (averaging US$150,000 base costs per&#13;
PA) would improve staff morale and increase the amount of time staff spend in the field,&#13;
thereby increasing staff efficiency and effectiveness.&#13;
Outputs from Village Ecodevelopment&#13;
5.    Microplanning and Implementation Support (ranging from US$1,500 per&#13;
group to US$9,200 per group, depending on group size and local cost parameters,&#13;
covering a three to four year period for each group, for about 800 groups) would:&#13;
(a)   provide the basis for conflict resolution by identifying and defining&#13;
reciprocal commitments through an innovative and replicable participatory&#13;
negotiation process&#13;
(b)   strengthen the capacity of communities to obtain support services and to&#13;
negotiate with outsiders (e.g. traders, outside groups who use PA&#13;
resources)&#13;
(c)   secure an equitable distribution of benefits, and ensure participation of&#13;
women, tribals and other disadvantaged people in community decisions&#13;
about resource distribution and investment selection&#13;
(d)   preserve and apply traditional knowledge systems in resource management&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   increase the capacity of local communities to play a positive role in PA&#13;
protection.&#13;
6.    Implementing Reciprocal Commitments and Associated Investments&#13;
(US$300 base costs per household (including preinvestment for credibility and villager&#13;
contribution), or ranging in size from US$2,400 to US$67,500 per group, depending on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report               293                           Annex 21&#13;
the number of households in each group, usually covering a three year investment period&#13;
for each group). The commitments would involve about 71,000 households, although due&#13;
to phasing not all households would receive the full three year investment allocation. The&#13;
commitments and investments would:&#13;
(a)   slow, halt, or possibly even reverse unsustainable resource uses by local&#13;
people (e.g., grazing, fuel wood removal, NTFP removal, poaching)&#13;
(b)   partially offset negative economic and cultural impacts of PAs on local&#13;
people (especially vulnerable groups such as tribals and women) and&#13;
(c)   help enable local people to meet their basic needs in an environmentally&#13;
sustainable manner.&#13;
7.    Special Programs. This part of the project would:&#13;
(a)    Support joint forest management of about 700 ha in two PAs (at about&#13;
US$342 base costs per ha annually beyond the scope permitted within the&#13;
standard village ecodevelopment budget constraint, thereby reversing the&#13;
ecological degradation of areas surrounding the national parks and&#13;
sanctuaries&#13;
(b)   provide compensatory alternative livelihood opportunities and cultural&#13;
continuity activities to people in the PAs who have been most severely&#13;
affected by PA establishment and reduce population pressures within&#13;
national parks and sanctuaries; to do this use voluntary relocation&#13;
(estimated total base costs of less than US $440,000, averaging US$1180&#13;
base costs per participating household, of which about 50% would be spent&#13;
on support services for consultation, participatory planning, and&#13;
monitoring, and 50% spent on direct compensatory support)&#13;
(c)   increase flexibility by providing discretionary funds (limited to 18% of the&#13;
total investments associated with reciprocal commitments) for&#13;
supplemental investments to be identified by PA officials and agreed by&#13;
local people that would be made outside national parks and sanctuaries,&#13;
that would benefit PA biodiversity conservation and local people.&#13;
Outputs from Environmental Education, Impact Monitoring and Research&#13;
8.    Environmental Education and Visitor Management (averaging US$180,000&#13;
base costs per PA) would:&#13;
(a)   produce an explicit strategies for environmental education/awareness and&#13;
visitor management ecotourism activities focused on the project PAs&#13;
(b)   expand public understanding of and support for conservation of the project&#13;
PAs.&#13;
(c)   reduce adverse impacts of visitors&#13;
(d)   develop new incentives for local people to support PA conservation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                 294                             Annex 21&#13;
9.    Impact Monitoring and Research (averaging US$5 10,000 base costs per PA).&#13;
This part of the project would provide a factual basis for decision making. It would:&#13;
(a)    produce an explicit strategy for impact monitoring and research on the&#13;
project PAs&#13;
(b)    provide both accountability and a basis for improving project design on an&#13;
ongoing basis (through the project period by measuring project impacts and&#13;
effectiveness, comparing with initial expectations, and recommending&#13;
appropriate adjustments )&#13;
(c)    provide critical ecological and socioeconomic information, including&#13;
information on cause-effect relationships, needed to improve guidelines,&#13;
policies, and strategies for PA management and village ecodevelopment in&#13;
the project areas and&#13;
(d)   increase contractual monitoring and research capacity.&#13;
Outputs from Overall Project Management&#13;
10.   Overall project management (about US$340,000 per PA for PA-level project&#13;
administration, US$860,000 for basic national level project administration, US$100,000&#13;
for translation and publicity; US$140,000 for national policy and strategic framework&#13;
studies, US$1,060,000 for national-level implementation guidelines and capacity&#13;
development; and US$830,000 for national-level implementation review). Such&#13;
management would assist in the integration, timeliness, dissemination, quality,&#13;
accountability, and adaptive management of project implementation by providing&#13;
administrative, financial, communication, technical, and review services:&#13;
Outputs from Preparation of Future Projects&#13;
II.   Project preparation (averaging US$780,000 per project for three projects --budget&#13;
based on past preparation requirements of large scale biodiversity projects) would improve&#13;
biodiversity conservation prospects in other areas by providing a portfolio of biodiversity&#13;
project proposals eligible for GEF, IDA and other donor consideration.&#13;
Measurement of Benefits&#13;
12.   The feasibility analysis and justification of this project is not based on quantified&#13;
financial and economic rates of return. Currently available methodology for quantifying&#13;
the biodiversity benefits of this project would result in estimates of relative weights for&#13;
various benefits that would not be consistent with judgments by specialists. Therefore,&#13;
such quantification would not provide a useful basis for decision-making. The project&#13;
design does incorporate a process approach to the analysis of village ecodevelopment&#13;
investments' financial feasibility, a process which also incorporates technical and social&#13;
considerations. The small size and variation in site conditions of village ecodevelopment&#13;
This would include identifying negative impacts of PA establishment and reciprocal commitments&#13;
on vulnerable groups, especially tribals and women, and developing appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                295                            Annex 21&#13;
investments would make detailed site specific feasibility review prohibitively expensive. To&#13;
ensure cost effective feasibility assessment, selection of investments within a fixed budget&#13;
constraint, the requirement that beneficiaries contribute their own resources, and&#13;
monitoring would give local people incentive to seek expert advice where necessary and&#13;
to take responsibility for selecting investments that maximize their well-being (within the&#13;
eligibility constraints). The project would use written guidelines (e.g., Annex 8) and&#13;
specialist review to address generic issues, ensure that feasibility requirements are met,&#13;
and provide experimental learning and adaptive management through the dynamic&#13;
planning, monitoring and adjustment processes.&#13;
Alternatives, Public Sector Role and Fiscal Impact&#13;
13.   Consideration of Alternatives. The project PA management planning and village&#13;
ecodevelopment microplanning provide for continuing, participatory consideration of&#13;
alternative investments options (e.g., works to restore ecosystems, livelihood investments&#13;
to replace unsustainable resource uses) and their comparative costs and benefits&#13;
throughout the project period.&#13;
14.   Public Sector and Non-governmental Roles. The project directly addresses&#13;
environmental externalities that require public sector initiatives. However, the project also&#13;
maximizes private sector involvement by (a) using an incentive mechanism to create a&#13;
partnership with local people for conservation, (b) developing ecotourism strategies that&#13;
include careful consideration of private sector roles, and (c) relying on contractual services&#13;
rather than an expansion in government staff. The project design allocates substantial&#13;
responsibilities and resources to non-governmental entities, and supplies a small amount&#13;
supplemental resources directly to government in order to build capacity. Of the total&#13;
project costs, about US$31 million (46 percent) would flow to EDCs and US$17 million&#13;
(25 percent) to NGOs, academic institutions, and other contracted specialists. Most of the&#13;
US$2 million PPF (3 percent of total project costs) is also flowing to NGOs, academic&#13;
institutions, and EDCs. Project expenditures flowing to government would comprise&#13;
about US$17 million (25% of the total project costs) for works (that would be labor&#13;
intensive and would employ local people), goods, travel, salaries of existing staff and&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
15.   Cost Recovery. Cost recovery of the village ecodevelopment investment funds&#13;
would not be appropriate. The Government would provide the funds, not for the purpose&#13;
of development itself, but rather as an incentive for local people to forgo use of PA&#13;
resources. Furthermore, project funds would only partially compensate for local people's&#13;
total socioeconomic losses that stem from the original establishment of the PAs.&#13;
16.   Fiscal Impact. The project design includes several provisions such as budget&#13;
constraints, use of state budget norms, required investment contributions from local&#13;
people, a high degree of transparency, and extensive implementation review to keep&#13;
government expenditures at reasonable levels. The project PAs were selected in part&#13;
because the costs of protection were thought to be low relative to other PAs with&#13;
comparable biodiversity values and needs for strengthened protection. Project&#13;
expenditures would represent only an insignificant fraction of the total state forest&#13;
departments investment budgets. Incremental operation and maintenance expenditures are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                  296                              Annex 21&#13;
minimal. The net fiscal impact is kept as small as possible and the concessional financing&#13;
of GEF and IDA makes this impact even smaller. The project itself is completely&#13;
affordable. However, the project does represent a significant increase both in the state&#13;
forest department expenditures on wildlife and in the total development ("plan") budget&#13;
flowing through the MOEF. Furthermore, large scale replication without new sources of&#13;
financing would raise issues of long-term fiscal impacts. To address these long-term&#13;
concerns, the project includes studies at both the PA level and the national level on&#13;
financial sustainability and related topics such as ecotourism (see Annexes 7 and 11).&#13;
Risk Analysis&#13;
17.   This project is not for the faint-hearted. It has significant risks. Nevertheless, the&#13;
project should proceed because of the importance of conserving biodiversity, the critical&#13;
role of local people in conservation, and the potential of this project to provide the&#13;
foundation for long-term solutions to the challenging problems that India faces.&#13;
18.   Pressures External to the Project. The pressures of population growth, poverty&#13;
and commercial interests may undermine project efforts, at least in some of the PAs. While&#13;
the project includes activities, institutional mechanisms, and a legal covenant designed to&#13;
address regional issues, it is not possible to fully address these risks within the project&#13;
design&#13;
19.   Dangers of Unrealistic Expectations. The status of biodiversity is likely to&#13;
continue to decline in the project areas. It would be unrealistic to expect the project to&#13;
have an immediate impact or to be able single-handedly to completely halt biodiversity&#13;
degradation. Similarly, it would be unrealistic to expect that the project would be able to&#13;
completely redress past negative impacts of the PAs on local people. Furthermore,&#13;
biologists and social scientists have different perspectives and agendas that are sometimes&#13;
impossible to fully reconcile. The project and financiers face significant risks of being&#13;
associated with and blamed for negative trends and unmet needs, even if the project&#13;
succeeds in slowing the decline and addressing some needs. To address these risks, project&#13;
objectives clearly emphasize "reduction in" not "elimination of' negative impacts, project&#13;
preparation has included extensive efforts to communicate the project objectives, and&#13;
monitoring assessment criteria would further specify realistic expectations.&#13;
20.   Extensive Time and Commitment Required to Achieve Participation and&#13;
Trust. The participatory emphasis is new and will take time. Risks involve:&#13;
(a)   insufficient state government staff commitment to local participatory&#13;
decision-making; and&#13;
(b)   insufficient trust of local communities, disadvantaged groups and NGOs in&#13;
government initiatives.&#13;
To encourage sustained state government commitment to participation, the project would&#13;
allocate financing annually according to a review of work plans and progress reports and&#13;
avoiding a "blueprint" approach. To facilitate a gradual increase in trust, the project would&#13;
use participatory planning processes; include careful, comprehensive, and transparent&#13;
monitoring of social considerations, and assign important roles for NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                     297                                 Annex 21&#13;
21.    Limitations in Technical Implementation Capacity. India has a limited supply&#13;
of technical expertise. Both the Bank and India have limited experience with process-&#13;
oriented project design. Appraisal assessments of implementation capacity have helped&#13;
determine project scope, and detailed documentation provides guidance on project&#13;
processes.&#13;
22.    Inadequate Management Support. Potential risks include:&#13;
(a)    weaknesses in motivation and qualifications of project staff;&#13;
(b)    delays in bureaucratic processes involving flow of funds,&#13;
(c)    cumbersome logistics in arranging and processing contracts, and&#13;
(d)    poor assessments of project performance and/or poor use of assessments to&#13;
adjust project design.&#13;
The detailed specification of organizational responsibilities, administrative structures,&#13;
staffing plans, contracting arrangements, agreed performance indicators, and ongoing&#13;
planning and adjustment processes would help to ensure adequate management support&#13;
Activities funded by the Project Preparation Facility prior to negotiations further&#13;
demonstrate that sufficient management capacity exists.&#13;

            The Ecodevelopment Project will conserve
            biodiversity by implementing the ecodevelopment strategy in
            and around seven protected areas (PAs) and will also include
            support for preparing future biodiversity projects. The main
            objectives will be to: 1) improve capacity of PA management
            to conserve biodiversity and increase opportunities for
            local participation in PA management activities and
            decisions; 2) reduce negative impacts of local people on
            biodiversity, reduce negative impacts of PAs on local
            people, and increase collaboration of local people in
            conservation efforts; 3) develop more effective and
            extensive support for ecodevelopment; 4) ensure effective
            management of this project; and 5) prepare future
            biodiversity projects. The project will be implemented over
            a five-year period from October 1996 through September 2001.
            Its components correspond to its objectives and comprise: 1)
            improved PA management; 2) village ecodevelopment that
            reduces negative interactions of local people on
            biodiversity and increases collaboration of local people in
            conservation; 3) education and awareness and impact
            monitoring and research that develops more effective and
            extensive support for PA ecodevelopment; 4) overall project
            management; 5) preparation of future biodiversity projects;
            and 6) reimbursement of the project preparation facility.
