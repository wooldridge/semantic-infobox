&#13;
A Core Course on budgeting processes was presented by the Economic Development&#13;
Institute (EDI), in Washington, D.C., from June 15th to the 23rd, 1998. A total of 39&#13;
participants from 25 countries attended the course. Usable end of course assessment forms&#13;
were returned by 28 respondents, 72 percent of all participants. The objective of the course&#13;
was to provide a forum in which to discuss the issue of public expenditure management&#13;
system reform. The methods of instruction included lectures, group exercises, and case&#13;
studies.&#13;
&#13;
The EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) conducted an evaluation using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first was a survey of&#13;
participants' opinions of the course objectives and delivery. The second section attempted to&#13;
gauge the increase of knowledge gained from the course, using a set of self-assessment&#13;
questions. This evaluation pioneered a new self assessment device: the introduction of a&#13;
control question to increase the validity of the questionnaire. Both sections of the evaluation&#13;
used a 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum.&#13;
&#13;
Respondents had varied educational levels and professional backgrounds. Twenty-one of 31&#13;
had a Masters or equivalent. There were 4 respondents with a Bachelors or equivalent and 3&#13;
with a Doctorate or equivalent. Twenty-six of 31 worked in the public sector, although the&#13;
number of years experience in the field of budgeting, finance and/or development varied.&#13;
Nineteen of all the respondents had less than 10 years experience and 12 had over 10 years&#13;
relevant work experience. No information on gender was collected. Results from the&#13;
evaluation are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The questions asking the respondents for their opinion of the course fell into 2 major&#13;
        categories. The first category addressed the objectives of the course, and asked&#13;
        questions about whether the respondents had learned new information, concepts and&#13;
        policies. There were three such questions asked, and the mean scores ranged from&#13;
        3.77 - 3.94 out of 5. The second category addressed the design and delivery of the&#13;
        course. Questions asked were related to course materials, faculty communication,&#13;
        and level of interest, among other topics. There were 7 questions asked under this&#13;
        category, and the mean scores ranged from 3.81 to 4.45.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  An overall question asking respondents if the course was a worthwhile use of their&#13;
        time received a mean score of 4.52, which was the highest mean score of the&#13;
        evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Due to small numbers of private sector respondents as well as respondents with&#13;
        either a Bachelors or a Doctorate degree, analysis by sector or academic group was&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 problematic. However, comparisons were made between those respondents with less&#13;
 than 10 years experience and those with greater than 10 years experience. No&#13;
 significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of satisfaction with&#13;
 the course or knowledge gained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe highest and lowest scores for each item of this course were favorable. No item in&#13;
 this evaluation received a rating of 1, the lowest possible score. Moreover, every item&#13;
 received at least one 5, the highest possible score.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lFor the first time in EDIRP, a control question was used in the self-assessment&#13;
 portion of the evaluation. This was done to eliminate influencing factors other than the&#13;
 teaching of the course. To control for these non-teaching influences, a question was&#13;
 asked which had not been taught in the course. The pre-course mean score for this&#13;
 control question was 3.03, and the post-course mean score was 3.70, which is a&#13;
 perceived change in knowledge of .67. This number, which represents the (perceived)&#13;
 knowledge gain from non-teaching influences, was then subtracted from the pre/post&#13;
 change values of the non-control questions. The result was a net pre/post change&#13;
 score which relates more precisely to the teaching of the course. The range of net&#13;
 pre/post change scores was .10 to .70.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe range of the pre/post change scores may point out areas of relative strength and&#13;
 weakness of the course. The lowest net change score was .10. This was given for the&#13;
 item covering "general principles that govern the choice of public or private delivery of&#13;
 services". The highest net change score was .70. This was for "the role of&#13;
 performance measurement in encouraging accountability of public servants".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lOne limitation of this evaluation is that the pre/post data are based on self-evaluation&#13;
 and therefore measure only perceived knowledge gains. A cognitive-based test done&#13;
 before and after the course would better measure actual learning gains. In addition,&#13;
 this evaluation may not accurately portray the opinions of all participants as some did&#13;
 not complete a questionnaire. Therefore, it is important to encourage all participants&#13;
 to provide feedback.&#13;
