IBRD's lending operations have conformed generally    25-&#13;
to five principles derived from its Articles. These                             Adjustment&#13;
principles, taken together, seek to ensure that IBRD&#13;
loans are made to member countries for financially&#13;
and economically sound purposes to which those        0-&#13;
countries have assigned high priority, and that funds  FY93 FY94 FY95 FY96 FY97 FY98 FY99 FYOO&#13;

described in Box 2. Within the scope permitted by the&#13;
Articles, application of these principles must be devel-&#13;
oped and adjusted in light of experience and changing&#13;
conditions.&#13;
4 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 2: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
(i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories of&#13;
member countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the project is&#13;
located must be guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or its central&#13;
bank or a comparable agency of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the member itself&#13;
has been obtained in all such cases to date.&#13;
(ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member&#13;
countries. Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, eco-&#13;
nomic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness.&#13;
(iii) In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Deci-&#13;
sions to make loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's eco-&#13;
nomic structure, including assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
(iv) IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's&#13;
overall external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under&#13;
conditions which, in the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. IBRD is intended to pro-&#13;
mote private investment, not to compete with it.&#13;
(v) The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are&#13;
used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-&#13;

a.  Effective January 1, 1999, the euro was introduced. For reporting purposes, amounts in the eleven national currencies that are considered&#13;
national currency units of the euro have been aggregated with the euro and reported as euro in both the current and prior year&#13;
b.  Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The present target ro tio is&#13;
one US. dollar for every 125 Japanese yen and one euro. These three major currencies comprise at least 90% of the multicurrency loans' U ' dol-&#13;
lar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. This ratio was changed in January 1999 as a result of the introduction of the euro.&#13;
The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the selection of currencies for disbursements on those loans and by the currencies selected&#13;
for the billing of the principal repayments. Along with the selection of disbursement currencies, IBRD manages the selection of repayment currencies&#13;
to maintain the alignment of the multicurrency loans' composition with the target ratio. The selection of currencies for repayment biling by IBRD&#13;
precludes the determination of average maturity information for multicurrency loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the&#13;
maturity periods for its multicurrency loans on a combined US. dollars equivalent basis.&#13;
c.  Excludes effects of any waivers of loan interest.&#13;

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, including the summary statement of loans and&#13;
the statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as of June 30, 2000, and the&#13;
related statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained eamings, and cash&#13;
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2000. These fmancial&#13;
statements are the responsibility of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these fmancial statements based on&#13;
our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting&#13;
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the&#13;
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating&#13;
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable&#13;
basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial&#13;
position of the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of June 30, 2000 and&#13;
1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#13;

President and Board of Govemors&#13;
Intemational Development Association&#13;
We have audited the accompanying special purpose statements of sources and applications of development&#13;
resources of the International Development Association as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, including the&#13;
summary statement of development credits and statement of voting power, and subscriptions and&#13;
contributions as of June 30, 2000, and the related special purpose statements of income, comprehensive&#13;
income, changes in retained eamings, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended&#13;
June 30, 2000. These special purpose financial statements are the responsibihty of the Intemational&#13;
Development Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special&#13;
purpose financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and&#13;
applications of development resources, operations, and cash flows of the Intemational Development&#13;
Association to comply with Article VI, Section II(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the Intemational&#13;
Development Association, as discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, and are not&#13;
intended to be a presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America or International Accounting Standards.&#13;
As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, during fiscal year 2000 the Intemational Development&#13;
Association changed its accounting policy for the HIPC Debt Initiative and, retroactively, restated the&#13;
financial statements for the change. Under the new accounting policy, development grants and any&#13;
impairments of outstanding development credits in connection with the HIPC Debt Initiative are&#13;
recognized as charges to income.&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the sources and applications of development resources of the Intemational Development&#13;
Association as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the&#13;
three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2000 in conformity with the accounting principles described&#13;
in Note A to the special purpose financial statements.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, management, and&#13;
members of the Intemational Development Association. However, under the International Development&#13;
Association's Articles of Agreement, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not&#13;
limited.&#13;

We have audited the accompanying special purpose statements of sources and applications of development&#13;
resources of the Interim Trust Fund as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, including the surnmary statement of&#13;
interim fund credits and statement of contributions as of June 30, 2000, and the related special purpose&#13;
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained eamings, and cash flows for each of the&#13;
three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2000. These special purpose financial statements are the&#13;
responsibility of the Intemational Development Association's management as Administrator of the Interim&#13;
Trust Fund. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based&#13;
on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and Intemational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and&#13;
applications of development resources, operations, and cash flows of the Interim Trust Fund to comply&#13;
with Article VI, Section 1 l(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the Intemational Development Association,&#13;
as discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, and are not intended to be a presentation&#13;
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or&#13;
Intemational Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the sources and applications of development resources of the Interim Trust Fund as of June 30,&#13;
2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 2000 in confomiity with the accounting principles described in Note A to the special&#13;
purpose financial statements.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, the Intenational&#13;
Development Association's management as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund, and contributors to&#13;
and borrowers from the Interim Trust Fund. However, under the International Development Association's&#13;
Board of Governors' resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund, this report is included in the Annual&#13;

bs Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational cutoff for IDA&#13;
eligibility for fiscal 2001 is a 1999 GNP per capita of US$885, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries also meet&#13;
tests of performance. In exceptional circumstances, IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff&#13;
and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD lending An exception has been made for small island&#13;
economies (see footnote c).&#13;
c. During the IDA-12 period (fiscal 2000-02), an exception to the GNP per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility (US$885 for&#13;
fiscal 2001) has been made for some small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance&#13;
because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries, IDA funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment&#13;
programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness.&#13;

            following are some of the highlights of Fiscal Year 2000: a)
            The share of projects at risk of not achieving their
            development objectives fell to an estimated 15 percent of
            the total in fiscal 2000, or roughly half the rate of fiscal
            1998. b) New lending commitments declined to $15.3 billion.
            c) Seven countries qualified for debt relief under the
            enhanced initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, six
            of them in Africa. d) The Bank and the International
            Monetary Fund began to help countries prepare Poverty
            Reduction Strategies, which are becoming the basis for debt
            relief and concessional lending by the Bank, the Fund, and
            other development partners. e) The Bank announced up to $1
            billion support to help borrowers of the International
            Development Association to combat HIV/AIDS, and to address
            priority social problems with cross-border or global
            dimensions - with a special focus on Africa, and active
            partnership in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
