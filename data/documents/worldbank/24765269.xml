ï»¿ANNEX 1&#13;
Part II Europe 2020 Programmatic Single-Donor Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission and&#13;
the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set forth&#13;
above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The sub-objectives and description of activities are:&#13;
(a) The European Commission, specifically DG CONNECT, has expressed an interest in ensuring that the&#13;
Bank provides technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund with the specific objective of&#13;
facilitating the efficient flow of private and public investments into broadband connectivity projects to a&#13;
selected number of EU communities wishing to apply for funding to construct broadband networks, in&#13;
line with, in particular, Regulation (EU) 1316/2013 (CEF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) 283/2014&#13;
(CEF telecommunications guidelines).&#13;
(b) The activities (which may be described as "components" of activities) to be financed by the Trust&#13;
Fund, in support of the sub-objectives cited in Section 2.1 (a) above, are the following Bank-executed&#13;
activities, for which the Bank has implementation responsibility:&#13;
Phase 1:&#13;
Carrying out of extensive research and consultations with governments and various stakeholders in the&#13;
EU. In particular, carrying out of consultations on the goals of the Connect Europe Facility and related&#13;
"Connected Communities" proposals, broadband strategy and investment leveraging on the tools of the&#13;
CEF and other sources of funding, and ways to deepen the impact of existing EU support in the area of&#13;
broadband at the regional and local level.&#13;
Phase 2:&#13;
(a)    Technical assistance to individual proiects:&#13;
Based on the results of the Connected Communities initiative and the evaluation and selection of potential&#13;
projects (the "Selected Projects") carried out by DG CONNECT, provision of technical assistance to&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿between 10 and 15 Selected Projects. This number may be increased, especially in the case of successful&#13;
aggregation, by agreement of the Parties. The technical assistance aims to facilitate, for each Selected&#13;
Project, the readiness for potential financing under CEF by, inter alia, assisting in developing feasibility&#13;
studies, preparing sound business plans, and developing targeted knowledge products.&#13;
In the provision of its technical assistance, the Bank shall take into consideration existing initiatives to&#13;
prevent duplication of efforts. The technical assistance will also identify ways to aggregate several&#13;
broadband projects together to be reviewed by the EIB and other financial institutions in a portfolio&#13;
approach. In particular, the technical assistance to be provided by the Bank will focus on:&#13;
Feasibility and structuring assistance for each Selected Project, including, inter alia:&#13;
(i) Setting-up the Selected Project's overall timeline and key milestones up to project completion.&#13;
(ii) Assisting in preparing required documentation for financing application regarding, inter alia,&#13;
state aid rules, choice of business model, financing plan, business plan.&#13;
(iii) Identifying needs and feasibility of the Selected Project: covering, inter alia, assessment of&#13;
demand including demand for public services on-line and demand on a given territory;&#13;
assessment of pre-existing supply and infrastructure, if any (including, inter alia, profile and&#13;
activities of existing public and private stakeholders relevant to the Selected Project), use of&#13;
mapping or other resources readily available; assistance in preparing mapping studies or other&#13;
support studies to the Selected Project.&#13;
(iv) Providing support legal advice e.g. regarding procurement or state aid, if required (projects&#13;
receiving public support, e.g. combination of CEF financial instruments with ESIF funding).&#13;
(v) Providing support to prepare financing plans, including projections for rollout costs and&#13;
revenues over the first [151 years and envisaged sources of funding needs/availability.&#13;
(vi) If European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF) funding is also envisaged, provision of&#13;
support to further guide beneficiaries to relevant specialized support (such as Jaspers).&#13;
(vii) Providing guidance on other topics relevant to the preparation of the Selected Project to&#13;
financing by the EIB or other financial institutions.&#13;
*      Assistance in project aggregation&#13;
(i) Estimating potential aggregation of demand, public and private, at the local, municipal and&#13;
provincial level.&#13;
(ii) Advising on potential financial structures: decision to establish Special Purpose Vehicles&#13;
(SPV), governance structure and mechanisms, position of equity and debt holders, profile of&#13;
public and private stakeholders.&#13;
(iii) Identifying and designing Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models for the development of&#13;
broadband, including models separating active and passive broadband infrastructure, and&#13;
wholesale-retail models.&#13;
(iv) Establishing blueprints for project design that can be replicated in other similar&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donor,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank&#13;
resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant&#13;
decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The&#13;
Donor acknowledges that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-&#13;
terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member&#13;
country that may apply to the Donor.&#13;
2.     Manaement of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is Euro (the "Holding&#13;
Currency").&#13;
2.3    The Donor agrees to deposit its Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;
activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
9&#13;

amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    The Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;
be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of the Donor and which would&#13;
thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement&#13;
existing Administration Agreements or from new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the&#13;
Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If the Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
5.     Progress Reporting&#13;

of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by&#13;
the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not&#13;
constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;

Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donor) after such&#13;

Agreement(s) of the Donor. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining&#13;
balance of the Trust Fund to the Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund&#13;
