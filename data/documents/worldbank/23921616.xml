Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Financing (Southern African Power Pool Program for&#13;
Accelerating Transformational Energy Projects) to the Southern African Power Pool&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of the International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extends to the&#13;
Southern African Power Pool (the Recipient) a grant in an amount equivalent to SDR 13,200,000. The&#13;
purpose of said grant is to advance the preparation of selected priority regional energy projects in the SAPP&#13;
Participating Countries.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such a financing, and of&#13;
the purpose to which the proceeds of the financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such financing are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Recipient's member countries and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of its member&#13;
countries.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from the Association,&#13;
and hereby recommends said project for such assistance.&#13;
