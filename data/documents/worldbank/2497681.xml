Water, sanitation and hygiene are vital&#13;
components of sustainable development&#13;
and the alleviation of poverty. Across&#13;
Africa, political leaders and sector&#13;
specialists are generating new&#13;
momentum in these important areas.&#13;
This Field Note, together with the others&#13;
in the same series, constitutes a timely&#13;
contribution to that work. It is intended&#13;
principally to help politicians, leaders&#13;
and professionals in their activities. As&#13;

I commend it to your attention.              countries. The technical aspects of constructing them are well known, and the techniques for communities&#13;
                                             to manage them have become established and accepted.&#13;
                                                 This Field Note looks at large-scale community-managed piped water supplies in three countries&#13;
                                             (Ethiopia, Malawi, and Kenya) where such supplies have been successfully implemented for many years. It&#13;

                                             does not claim to analyse the whole subject of community management.&#13;
                                                 The principles of community management are applied differently in the three countries. However, their&#13;
                                             experiences yield several clear conclusions regarding sustainability. First, social cohesion gives rise to the&#13;

                                             including the authority to set tariffs, the use of metering and sanctions against non-payers, is important for&#13;
                                             financial sustainability. Thirdly, the viability of community management systems improves if they have paid&#13;

                                                 These examples of large community-managed piped water supplies are not unique but could be&#13;

    The committees and boards are formally linked to the&#13;
local government water and health departments for support.&#13;
For example, the water department seconds staff to carry&#13;
out repairs and quality control activities that are beyond&#13;
the technical capacity of the Water Management Board.&#13;
This is, in effect, a small government subsidy for operation&#13;
and maintenance.&#13;
    The government and the external support agency provide&#13;
extensive training to the various committees, the Board&#13;

&#13;
Cost recovery&#13;
    All public tapstands and private connections are metered&#13;
and read monthly. Consumers using the public taps pay by&#13;
the bucket at a rate equivalent to US$0.12 per cubic metre.&#13;
Those with private connections pay US$0.18 and US$0.20&#13;
per cubic metre for domestic and non-domestic connections&#13;
respectively. Very few consumers are disconnected for&#13;
non-payment. Connection charges constitute another&#13;
source of revenue.&#13;
    These tariffs are set by the government. Although the&#13;
tariffs are low by international standards, the schemes'&#13;
revenues currently exceed their running costs. However, the&#13;
surplus will probably not cover extensions, major repairs, or          this low consumption worries the Water Management Boards,&#13;

    These supplies continue to work well. There is a strong            for example in horticulture.&#13;
sense of social cohesion among the users, good financial                   In the long term the income will not cover major repair&#13;
discipline and reporting, and the tapstands are kept clean             expenses as the systems become older and experience more&#13;
and functioning. However, the people are using much less               serious breakdowns. The users told the WaterAid researchers&#13;
water than originally anticipated, and so the income is less           about many factors affecting their consumption and hence&#13;
than planned. For example, a recent research study by                  the scheme's income, and the study concluded that the&#13;
WaterAid at Hitosa and Gonde Iteya water supply schemes                best strategies to increase total income would be increased&#13;
found that people were only using 8 or 9 litres per day, and           water tariffs (especially for private connections), more&#13;
even less in the rainy season. In addition to the inadequacy           private connections, and public education to encourage&#13;
of this volume for people's domestic and hygiene needs,                higher consumption.&#13;

  Examples: Tereta and Hitosa water supplies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Tereta water supply was designed for a population of 52,000 people in 15 villages, which is a typical size for the schemes in Oromia.&#13;
  Water from three springs flows by gravity through over 60 km of pipelines with 21 reservoir tanks. The people access the waterthrough&#13;
  50 public tapstands; there are also a few private connections in one small town within the area. During the years 1994-1996, annual&#13;
  income averaged US$4,000 and annual expenditure averaged US$2,000.&#13;
       Hitosa water supply was planned and implemented using similar principles, and completed in 1996. It serves 70,000 people&#13;
  through 142 km of pipe supplying 122 public tapstands and 506 household connections.&#13;

have had a wide influence in other countries.                have had to take a more active leadership role by default.&#13;
    As a result of this national programme, Malawi has over      As to training, originally the government provided&#13;

Description and project implementation                       communities is undertaken.&#13;
    This was a centrally managed programme, intended to&#13;
fulfil the government's duty to supply water to as many      Cost recovery&#13;
people as possible. The government engineers developed           When planning the schemes, the government promised&#13;
standards for design and construction, and identified        consumers that, in return for their work in constructing and&#13;
locations that were most suitable for such schemes. Donors,  managing the schemes, they would not have to contribute&#13;
notably the United States Agency for International           cash for operation and maintenance other than for replacing&#13;
Development (USAID), provided much of the finance.           and repairing taps and tapstands and cleaning intakes. The&#13;
    Each scheme consisted of one or more intakes and         government retained responsibility for meeting all the other&#13;
a sedimentation tank, a supply line to one or more           cash costs of operation and maintenance. However, it did&#13;
main reservoir tanks, and distribution networks to public    not include a separate budget for rural piped schemes until&#13;
tapstands. As in Ethiopia, the projects were designed to     1987: instead it systematically over-ordered construction&#13;
serve the entire population in the supply area, but only     materials in order to cover operation and maintenance. This&#13;
through public tapstands.                                    was, in effect, a subsidy from the external support agencies.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
     So, although communities made a large contribution to                          schemes have a significantly worse record of maintenance than&#13;
construction,1 they do not pay cash for their water and they                        the smaller, more socially cohesive, schemes.&#13;
have also been reluctant to contribute their time and labour                             Secondly, the people are extremely poor and have many&#13;

community of the time required to maintain the schemes                              sufficient education about the merits of a piped water supply&#13;
&#13;
is high because the schemes are large in terms of                                   to motivate them to spend their money on it. In&#13;

kilometres of pipe per consumer (typically twice as large as                        communities where external support agencies have been&#13;

&#13;
     In recent years, some external support agencies have                           motivated to sustain the supply.&#13;
&#13;
started to help communities rehabilitate a few of the schemes.&#13;
Those communities are setting their own tariffs (usually an                         Self-help rural water&#13;

 Example: Kabuku water supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The Kabuku water supply is a pumped system. Water from a spring is pumped 2 km up to a reservoir tank; from there&#13;
 it flows by gravity through a 15-km distribution network to 300 yard and house connections serving about 1,800 people&#13;
 and three public tapstands serving 700 people. The household connections supply over 50 litres per person per day.&#13;
      Kabuku is a self-help project, completed in 1979. It provided some water for nine years thereafter, before failing in&#13;
 1988. Later, the group members obtained support from the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) for&#13;
 redesign, rehabilitation, development of management systems and training. By 1993, the project was fully operational.&#13;
      Kabuku now provides an example of strong financial management. Through metering, effective pricing and collection,&#13;
 the income is reliable. That reliable income enables the system to work well, supplying water to everybody. Its annual&#13;
 income averages US$11,000 and annual operation and maintenance expenditure averages US$9,000. This surplus goes&#13;
 towards replacement and extension of the infrastructure: for example, it was recently used to enlarge the reservoir tank.&#13;

Lessons from these examples                                         The schemes in Ethiopia and Kenya employ staff with&#13;
                                                                technical, administrative, and financial responsibilities. Other&#13;

    These community-managed water supplies in Ethiopia,         not employ any staff. Instead, the volunteers and a&#13;
    Malawi and Kenya have been operating for years. While       government-employed monitoring assistant are supposed&#13;
    the managerial arrangements in the three countries          to carry out the functions for which people are employed in&#13;
    are different, there are some common conclusions that       the other two countries. In practice, these volunteers and&#13;
are relevant for other countries and agencies planning          staff are not doing the necessary maintenance. The&#13;

    The cohesion of the community is an important factor in     tasks, but also for management and administration.&#13;
the long-term functioning of these large piped water supplies.&#13;
In Ethiopia, the people's high level of social cooperation      Managerial and governance&#13;
enables very large schemes to be undertaken; in Malawi the      training is important&#13;
more varied ethnic and social composition implies a smaller         Relevant, practical and well-tailored training seems to&#13;
optimum size for sustainable schemes; in Kenya the self-        have a major influence on chances of success. Suitable&#13;
help schemes serve a slightly different type of community       training, combined with good management systems, can&#13;
group, not necessarily everybody living in a particular area.   enable staff with little formal education to operate and&#13;
&#13;
In each case the strong cohesion within the group generates     maintain a complex water supply. This can be seen especially&#13;
&#13;
a clarity of purpose and a sense of ownership, which in turn    in Ethiopia and Kenya, whereas in Malawi the absence of&#13;

            Rural piped water supplies in Ethiopia,
            Malawi and Kenya: community management and sustainability
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Large piped water supplies constitute a
            viable and cost-effective form of water supply in developing
            countries. The technical aspects of constructing them are
            well known, and the techniques for communities to manage
            them have become established and accepted. This Field Note
            looks at large-scale community-managed piped water supplies
            in three countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, and Kenya) where such
            supplies have been successfully implemented for many years.
            It concentrates on the long-term sustainability of the
            service provided by such schemes; given its length, it does
            not claim to analyze the whole subject of community
            management. The principles of community management are
            applied differently in the three countries. However, their
            experiences yield several clear conclusions regarding
            sustainability. First, social cohesion gives rise to the
            clarity of purpose and sense of ownership that ensure
            sustainability. Secondly, sound financial management,
            including the authority to set tariffs, the use of metering
            and sanctions against non-payers, is important for financial
            sustainability. Thirdly, the viability of community
            management systems improves if they have paid staff, good
            training for the community members and the management
            committees, and access to technical and professional support
            when needed. These examples of large community-managed piped
            water supplies are not unique but could be replicated in
            other places in Africa with suitable water sources and
            social structures.
