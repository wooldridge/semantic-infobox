1. OVERVIEW&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (IF  or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956, to further&#13;
economic growth in its developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IIF( is a member of the WVorld Bank&#13;
Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRI) o r the WWorld Bank), the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) and the Mlultilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MI.G.A.). It is a legal entity separate and distinct&#13;
from the WN,orld Bank, IDA and M.l.G.A. with its own Articles of Agreemenit, share capital, financial structure, management and staff&#13;
Mlembership in IFC is open only to member countries of the WVorld Bank. As of lune 30, 1999 IFC's entire share capital was held by&#13;
174 member countries.&#13;
ItC's principal products are loans and equity investments. Unlike most multilateral development institutions, IF(' does not accept host&#13;
government guarantees on its loans or equity investments. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending anid equity investment activi-&#13;
ties through the issuance of debt obligations in the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with the&#13;
WVorld Bank. During the year ended JuLne 3t), 1999 (FY99), IF(t was authorized to borrow up to $200 million equivalent under the facility&#13;
with the WNorld Bank, representing 3.661o of the FY99 authorized borrowing ceiling of $5,S0t) million.&#13;
IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily in US dollars. The (Corporation seeks to minimize nmarket risk (foreign&#13;
exchange and interest rate risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies with assets&#13;
with the same characteristics. 'I'he Corporation controls residual market risk by utilizinig currency and interest rate swaps and other deriv-&#13;
ative finanicial instruments.&#13;
II. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
From year to year, IFC's net income is affected bv a number of factors, principall [Lhe magniitude of provision for losses against its loans&#13;
and equity investments, loans in nonaccrual status and income generated from its equity portfolio. IFC has been consistently profitable&#13;
since its inception in 1956 and net income for FY99 was $249 million as compared with $246 million for the year ended June 30, 1998&#13;
(FY98) after reaching a record high of $432 million in the vear ended June 30, 1997 (FY97).&#13;

III. CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
IFC, together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment, improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by&#13;
making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to create investment oppor-&#13;
tunities by bringing together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby helping to create conditions&#13;
conducive to the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign, into productive investments in its developing member countries. Thus,&#13;
IFC plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through&#13;
loan syndications, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and tech-&#13;
nical advisory services to private businesses in developing member countries and also advises member governments on private sector&#13;
development matters.&#13;
IF(C's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in&#13;
productive private enterprises. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public&#13;
sector, if (I) such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a mar-&#13;
ket context and according to profitability criteria, and/or (2) are in the process of being totally or partially privatized. The Corporation&#13;
applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability and developmental impact in determining the eligibility of projects for&#13;
its investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Investment Process and Portfolio Supervision&#13;
IFC's investment process can be divided into several main stages: (1) identification and appraisal; (2) Board approval; (3) document&#13;
negotiation; (4) commitment; (5) disbursement; and (6) supervision. The initial four stages are carried out under the responsibility of&#13;
the Vice President, Investment Operations, while the fifth and sixth stages are overseen by the Vice President, Portfolio Management and&#13;
Advisory Operations.&#13;
The Corporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with IFC's internal policies and&#13;
procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such matters and of recommended courses of action through internal reporting&#13;
at regular intervals.&#13;

Investment Products&#13;
Loans&#13;
t L      L W   Loans account for the bulk of the financing provided by IFC, representing 77% of the Corporation's disbursed and outstanding investment&#13;
porttolio as of June 30,1999, unchanged from June 30, 1998. Project financing ("greenfield" projects, expansions and modernizations) is&#13;
&gt;, L      the Corporation's main investment activity. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing programs of&#13;
Xs.   L     investments. In addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial intermediaries to fund certain project, sectoral and general&#13;
purpose financing as well as for specialized products such as leasing, trade and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function&#13;
either as IFC's borrower, in which case they on-lend to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, in which case the&#13;
Corporation makes direct loans to individual private sector companies identified by the agent.&#13;
IFC's loans are medium to long term (typically amortizing loans carrying final maturities of 7 to 12 years) and are available primarily in a&#13;
variet y of convertible currencies (principally US dollar, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen) at fixed or variable interest rates. Beginning in&#13;
FY99. IFC also offers local currency loan products to certain clients, provided the Corporation is able to hedge its local currency exposure&#13;
through mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Loan pricing reflects such factors as IFC's cost of funds, market&#13;
conditions and country and project risks. Variable rate loans are generally tied to the 6-month LIBOR index in each currency. The major-&#13;
itv of IFC's loans are variable rate US dollar loans tied to the 6-month US dollar LIBOR index, and most other loans are normally trans-&#13;
formed, using currency and interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate loans. At June 30, 1999 91% (91%-June 30, 1998) of the&#13;
Corporation's loans were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
At June 30, 1999 total loans disbursed and outstanding were $7.7 billion ($6.9 billion-June 30, 1998). The currency composition of the&#13;
loan portfolio at June 30, 1999 and 1998 weas as follows:&#13;

Equity and Quasi-Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 23% of the Corporation's disbursed portfolio at June 30, 1999, unchanged from June 30, 1998. IFC's&#13;
equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usually denominated in the currency of the country in&#13;
which the investment is made.&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments, such as&#13;
subordinated or convertible loans. Quasi-equity investments constitute a small but growing portion of the Corporation's investment&#13;
portfolio. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporation's&#13;
balance sheet. At June 30, 1999 the Corporation's quasi-equity portfolio totaled $995 million ($852 million-June 30, 1998), of which&#13;
$913 million was classified as loans ($761 nillion-June 30, 1998) and $82 miillion ($91 million-June 30, 1998) was classified as equity&#13;
investments in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Client Risk Management Services&#13;
IFC provides its clients with access to asset and liability management tools such as interest rate, currency- and commodity-indexed swaps,&#13;
caps and floors and other derivative financial instruments by intermediating between market counterparties and its clients. IFC has also&#13;
provided risk-sharing structures and guarantees which allow its clients to transact directly with market counterparties. The Corporation&#13;
requires that all transactions be for hedging purposes only.&#13;
Guarantees&#13;
'I he Corporation's guarantee is available for both debt instruments and trade obligations of clients and typically covers commercial as&#13;
well as nonicommercial risks. Guarantee fees are calculated so as to be consistent with IFC's loan pricing policies. IFC will provide local&#13;
currency guarantees but only if the Corporation is able to fund its commitment in local currency terms, for example, by hedging its expo-&#13;
sure in the swap market.&#13;
Resource Mobilization Activities&#13;
'IThe Corporation mobilizes finance for the private sector in developing member countries by encouraging private sector companies and&#13;
financial institutions to participate in IFC's investment projects. This usually takes the form of an equity investment or co-financed lend-&#13;
ing to a project that also receives IFC financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Corporation also mobilizes funds directly through mechanisms such as loan syndications. IFFC's syndications involve arrangements&#13;
whereby banks and other financial institutions purchase participations in an IFC loan to a client company. The loan participations are&#13;
sold without recourse to IFC; thus, participants accept the same commercial risks as IFC. IFC always retains a portion of the loan for its&#13;
own account and, as the only lender of record, administers the entire loan including the portion subject to participation. IFC charges fees&#13;
to the borrower for its syndication services consistent with those prevailing for comparable services in the financial markets. During the&#13;
year ended June 30, 1999 IFC approved $1.8 billion in syndicated loans ($2.5 billion-year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
Underwritings and Investment Banking Services&#13;
IFC provides underwriting and placement services of equity, quasi-equity and/or debt securities for private sector companies in IFC's   5&#13;
developing member countries and structuring and underwriting of country funds and pooled investment vehicles such as private&#13;
investment funds. In this role, IFC is often a core investor. The Corporation does not conduct any sales activities within the United&#13;
States or directed at US investors in connection with securities offerings of private sector companies or pooled investment vehicles. The&#13;
Corporation prices these services in conformity with market standards and practices, in coinjunction with internatioinal securities firms&#13;
and financial intermediaries. Underwriting and other capital market services requiring a financial commitment from IFC are subject to&#13;
the same investment criteria and limits applicable to its loan and equity investments.&#13;
Advisory Activities&#13;
The Corporation provides three general types of advisory services to member countries as well as to individual enterprises: (1) special&#13;
advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging; (2) financial advisory services provided to member governments or to&#13;
private sector clients; and (3) policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development, including&#13;
privatization and foreign investment. The Corporation also assists governments with developing the legal framework for privatizing their&#13;
state-owned sectors, as well as with the sale of individual enterprises. Thle Corporation charges fees for its advisory services consistent&#13;
with market rates charged for comparable services. The amount of such fees was $33 million for the year ended June 30, 1999 ($66 mil-&#13;
lion-year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
Specialty Targeted Assistance&#13;
IFC has established a number of vehicles through which it can provide specially targeted assistance to areas of high developmental&#13;
priority. These include its business advisory services serving sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, the South Pacific&#13;
islands, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Vietnam; its Technical Assistance Trust Funds, which provide technological&#13;
assistance; and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, which advises governments on foreign direct investment.&#13;
IV. TREASURY SERVICES&#13;
Liquid Assets&#13;
IFC invests surplus liquidity in highly rated instruments issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other&#13;
official entities including government agencies and instrumentalities, or by multilateral organizations as well as AAA-rated corporate&#13;
securities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities. Surplus liquidity is also placed in time deposits and other unconditional&#13;
obligations of banks and financial institutions. IFC manages market risk associated with liquid assets investments through the usc of&#13;
derivative financial instruments, principally currency and interest rate swaps.&#13;
IFC's liquid assets are invested in three separate portfolios. The first portfolio (PI) consists of proceeds from market borrowings that have&#13;
been swapped into floating rate US dollar obligations. It is managed by IFC's Treasury Department against a 6-month US dollar LIBOR&#13;
bcnchmark. The second portfolio (P2) is comprised primarily of the Corporation's paid-in capital and accumulated earnings that have&#13;
not been invested in equity and quasi-equity investments or fixed-rate loans. Prior to July 1, 1999 IFC outsourced management of the P2&#13;
portfolio to IBRD's Treasury, but has since assumed direct management of the portfolio. P2 is managed against a 3-year duration bench-&#13;
mark. The third portfolio (P3), consisting of funds actively managed by external managers appointed by IFC against a 6-month US dollar&#13;
LIBOR benchmark, is invested in global fixed-income assets and mortgage-backed securities. Under guidelines in effect as of June 30,&#13;
1999 the P3 portfolio was not permitted to exceed 10% of the total value of liquid assets at any time (under current guidelines, increased&#13;
to 12%). The PI and P2 portfolios are accounted for as available for sale portfolios. The P3 portfolio is accounted for as a trading port-&#13;
folio. All liquid assets are managed according to an investment authority approved by IFC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines&#13;
approved by IFC's Finance Committee, a subcommittee of the Management Group.&#13;
As of June 30, 1999 the market value of IFC's liquid assets portfolio (net of associated derivative financial instruments and securities lend-&#13;
ing activities) amounted to $10.1 billion, up from 59.4 billion at June 30, 1998. As of June 30, 1999 the market values of Pt, P2 and P3&#13;
were, respectively, $6.2 billion, $3.1 billion and $0.8 billion.&#13;

Borrowings&#13;
F(C relies on the international capital markets as the major source of its borrowings. 1)uring the year ended June 30, 1999 the&#13;
Corporation borrowed $4.5 billion ($3.9 billion-year ended June 30, 1998). Under the Articles of Agrcemenet, the Corporation may&#13;
borrow 'In the public markets of a member country only with approvals from such member and the member in whose currency the&#13;
borrowing is denonin1ated.&#13;
IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source and maturity to provide flexibility and cost effectiveness. Outstanding market&#13;
borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one to slightly less than 30 vears with a weighted average life of 7.3 years at&#13;
June 30, 1999 (6.7 years-June 30, 1998). As of June 30, 1999 I[FC's outstanding borrowings totaled S12.4 billion ($11.2 billion-June 30,&#13;
1998), including $0.4 billion fromi the World Bank ($0.5 billion-JuLLe 30, 1998).&#13;
Market borrowings have generally been swapped into floating rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 1999 the&#13;
Corporation had gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $9.1 billion ($8.5 billion-June 30, 1998) and from borrowing-&#13;
related interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $4.3 billion ($3.2 billion-June 30, 1998). After considering the effect of&#13;
these derivative financial instruments, 1000% (99%-Junc 30, 1998) of the Corporation's market borrowinigs were US dollar-deinoiminiated.&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 5.1 % at June 30, 1999 compared&#13;
with 5.3('O at Junie 30, 1998.&#13;
Capital and Retained Earnings&#13;
As of Jlure 30, 1999 IFC's net worth (presented as 'total Capital in the Corporation's balance sheet) amounted to $5.3 billion, up from the&#13;
June 30, 1998 level of $5.1 billion, including S3.0 billion ($2.7 billion-June 30, 1998) in retained earnings.&#13;
As of June 30, 1999 and 1998, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.37 billion was subscribed ($2.36 billion-June 30,&#13;
1998) and $2.35 billion was paid in ($2.34 billion-June 30, 1998). IFC's subscribed capital increases as share allocations made under&#13;
the 1992 capital increases are subscribed by members during the remaining subscription period. Likewise, paid-in capital will increase as&#13;
menmbers pay for shares. Because virtually all members elect to pay in installments for shares subscribed, there will be differences between&#13;
IFC's subscribed and paid-in capital. As of June 30, 1999 IFC's paid-in capital of $2.35 billion ($2.34 billion-June 30, 1998) represented&#13;
99% of its subscribed capital (99%   June 30, 1998).&#13;
V. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL POLICIES&#13;
IFC assumes various kinds of risks in its private sector development business. I'he Corporation's operations and activities are principally&#13;
subiect to commercial or project risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Active management of these risks is an&#13;
essential part of the Corporation's operations and a key determinant of its ability to maintain1 a stable capital and earnings base.&#13;
IFC has adopted several key financial policies and a number of prudential policies in order to manage and control commercial or project&#13;
risk and liquidity risk associated with its investment portfolio. IFC uses derivative financial instrumenits to manage market risk associated&#13;
with its bo)rrowing, lending and liquidity managemiienit activities, and in connection with its client risk management products.&#13;
'I'he Notes to the Corporation's Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 (including, without limitationl Notes B, G, K&#13;
and L thereto) describe the Corporation's risk managenment activities and the use of derivative instruments.&#13;
Key Financial Policies&#13;
IF(C operates under the following key financial policies, which have been approved by its Board of D)irectors:&#13;
(1)      IFC's disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of loss reserves) may not exceed 100% of IFC's net worth, and IFC's&#13;
disbursed cquity investmcnts (nct of loss rcserves) may not cxceed 50%.6 of IFC('s net worth;&#13;
(2)      IFC( must maintain at all times a level of liquidity, including liquid assets and undrawn borrowing commitments from the&#13;
W`orld Bank, sufficient to cover at least 65% of its estimated net cash requirements for the next three years;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(3)      The currency. rate basis and maturity of IFC's loan assets and borrowings are required to be closely matched; and&#13;
(4)      IFC must maintain at all times a level of capital (including paid-in capital, retained earnings and general loss reserve) equal to at&#13;
least 30% of risk-weighted assets.&#13;
In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the WNorld Bank, IFC's leverage, as mea-&#13;
sured by the ratio of IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained earnings) may&#13;
not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
Managing Commercial (Project) Risk&#13;
IFC is prohibited from accepting host government guarantees of repayment on its investments and therefore incurs the commercial risk of&#13;
its investments. In addition to the key financial policies specified above, the Corporation's investments are subject to a number of opera-&#13;
tional or prudential limits, including limitations on single project exposure, single country exposure and segment concentration. Thus, IFC&#13;
does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost. The Corporation's equity investment in a company does&#13;
not normally represent more than 35% of such company's total share capital, provided further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder.&#13;
An investment in a single project or entity may not exceed 3% of IFC's total investment portfolio, with equity and quasi-equity investments&#13;
(as defined below) in a single project or entity not exceeding 3% of the Corporation's net worth plus general reserves. Total investments in a&#13;
single country will not normally represent more than 12% of IFC's total investment portfolio or 25% of its net worth, whichever is lower,&#13;
and the Corporation's total exposure in any industry should not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio.&#13;
The quality of IFC's investment portfolio is monitored according to established supervision procedures. The portfolio management units&#13;
of individual investment departments are responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and management of commercial risk associated with&#13;
projects originated by the departments, including monitoring and evaluating credit quality of the borrowers.&#13;
Loss Reserves Policy&#13;
IFC maintains a conservative loss reserves and revenue recognition policy. IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is&#13;
in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is&#13;
expected in the near future.&#13;
IFC's loss reserves policy reflects management's judgment as to identifiable impairment on specific loans and equity investmenits on&#13;
which such impairment is judged to be other than temporary. IFC considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and&#13;
events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses&#13;
for impaired loans represents management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective&#13;
interest rate. IFC establishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in value of the investment has occurred, below&#13;
its US dollar equivalent cost, which is considered other than temporary. In addition to the reserve on specific investments, the reserve&#13;
against losses includes an estimate of potential losses resulting from risks that cannot be specifically identified, as further described in&#13;
Note A to the Corporation's Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The reserve against losses is maintained through&#13;
annual charges to income. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
The quality of IFC's portfolio has been negatively affected by the Asian crisis during FY98 and its contagion effect. A key indicator of&#13;
portfolio performance, the amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, rose to 11.t% at June 30, 1999&#13;
as compared with 9.2% at June 30, 1998. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $857 million at June 30. 1999,&#13;
an increase of 35% from the June 30, 1998 level of $633 million.&#13;
As of June 30, 1999 IFC's total reserve against losses amounted to $1,825 million ($1,522 million-June 30, 1998) equivalent to 18.2%/o of&#13;
IFC's disbursed loan and equity investment portfolio (17.0%Yo-June 30, 1998). The five-year trend of loss reserves is presented below:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DIuring the vear enided June 30, 1999 the portfolio was further affected by continuing economic problems in emerging markets, although&#13;
the impact was less serious than in FY98. In that year, a number of key portfolio performance indicators deteriorated, such as loans in&#13;
nonaccrual status, the interest collection rate on loans and the number of loans in arrears. Further, currency devaluations and stock mar-&#13;
ket declines have continiued to affect the value of IFC's equity investmrents. The environment of the past two years resulted in historically&#13;
~ high levels of reserves against losses at June 30, 1999.&#13;
w       Managing Liquidity Risk&#13;
Tu he Corporation's Liquidity Policy requires the Corporation to maintain at all times sufficient liquidity (including liquid assets and&#13;
8      undrawdn  borrowiing commitnments from the World Bank) to cover at least 65% of its estimated net cash requirements for the next three&#13;
years. As a prudential mcasure, the Corporation maintains an operating liquidity target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash&#13;
requiremiienits, including projected disbursement and debt service requirements. At June 30, 1999 the Corporation's liquidity level stood&#13;
at S10.1 billion (or 10606  of its projected net cash requirements for three years).&#13;
Managing Market Risk&#13;
MNarket risk refers to changes in values of financial instruments or positions due to movements in interest or exchange rates, or liquidity&#13;
factors. 'The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to manage market risk (principally interest rate and exchange rate risk)&#13;
that arises primarily in the context of IFC's liquid assets and borrowinig activities.&#13;
Liquid Asset Investment Activities&#13;
As described above, IFC's liquid assets are invested in three separate portfolios: Pt ($6.2 billion as of Jule 30, 1999), managed by IFC&#13;
Treasurv; P2 (83.1 billion as of June 30, 1999), managed by IBR) 'Ireasury until June 30, 1999 and thereafter by IFC Treasury; and P3&#13;
($0.8 bi:llion as of June 30, 1999), managed by external managers appointed by IFC.&#13;
'I'he Corporation's matched-funding policy requires that all loans be funded at the time of Board approval with borrowings bearing similar&#13;
interest rate, currency and maturity characteristics. As the Corporation's loan assets are predominantly denominated in floating rate US&#13;
dollars, the PI and P3 portfolios are invested, directly or synthetically, in floating rate US dollar instruments. The matched-funding policy&#13;
limaits the Corporation's exposure to unmatched interest rate and exchange risks. As discussed below, residual market risks are managed on&#13;
a portfojio basis by the Asset and Liability Management Unit. P2 is invested in fixed rate US dollar denominated instruments.&#13;
LUnder I FC's InsVestmelt Guidelines, the Corporation's liquid assets are invested primarily in debt or asset-backed instruments issued by&#13;
sovereigns, agencies or AAA-rated corporates. The Corporation also places deposits with highly rated commercial banks and financial&#13;
institutions. IFC uses a variety of derivative financial instruments in its liquidity management activities for hedging purposes, to take&#13;
advantage of profitable trading opporttinities, and as a proxy for cash securities. The derivative financial instruments used include short-&#13;
term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps and exchange-traded futures and&#13;
options on fixed-income instrtuments.&#13;
Asset and Liability Management Activities&#13;
tn addition to interest rate risks arising from liquid assets, IFC faces residual market risks in its overall asset and liability management.&#13;
While IFC's matched funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, the Corporation is&#13;
exposed to currency risk due to the receipt of spread income in currencies other than US dollars or other events such as changes in the&#13;
level of iton-US dollar reserves against loans. IFC manages the currency risk described above bv monitoring the aggregate position in each&#13;
lending currency and eliminating the net asset or liability position in excess of S I million equivalent through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
In addition to currenlcy risks, IFC faces interest rate risks from two sources: (I) assets that are fully matched funded at inception can&#13;
becomc mismlatched over time due to writedowns, prepayments or rescheduling, and (2) LIBOR reset dates on assets can differ from&#13;
those on liabilities. Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is limited by synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and&#13;
managin,g residual risks on an aggregate basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns, prepayments and reschedul-&#13;
ilgs, and residual reset date mismatches is monitored monthly by measuring the change in the present value of assets and liabilities in&#13;
each currency for a one percentage point change in interest rates. A review trigger of $5 million equivalent has been established on this&#13;
measure for interest rate exposure in the aggregate and in each currency.&#13;
Borrowing Activities&#13;
IEC uses derivative financial instrtuments, primarily currency and interest rate swaps, in connection with its borrowing activities, in order&#13;
to lower the Corporation's overall funding costs bv creating synthetic variable rate US dollar borrowinigs and to hedge market risks arising&#13;
from bond issues. In general, and consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy, the Corporation issues securities in various&#13;
capital markets that offer the most attractive funding opportunities and uses derivative financial instruments to convert the associated&#13;
liabilities into obligations denominated in variable rate US dollars, the Corporation's principal lending currency. The Corporation also&#13;
enters into conmplex structured derivatives to hedge offsetting structures embedded in many of its borrowings, stuch as borrowiings payable&#13;
in multiple currencies, or borrowings ssith principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market&#13;
index, a reference interest rate, a commodits index or one or more foreign exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lending Activities&#13;
Derivative financial instruments are also used in connection with the Corporation's lending activities to minimize the level of interest rate&#13;
and currency exchange risk in non-US dollar lending.&#13;
Managing Credit Risk&#13;
Credit risk refers to the potential for a borrower or a counterpartv to a transaction with IFC to default on its financial obligations to the&#13;
Corporation. Credit risks arising in connection with IlC's treasury activities are monitored and controlled in accordance with credit risk&#13;
guidelines established by the Financial Policy &amp; Planning unit. Credit risk also arises in connection with the Corporation's loan and equity&#13;
investments. The risk of borrower default is discussed above, under Mlanaging Commercial (Project) Risk.                                    9&#13;
Credit Risk in Treasury Operations&#13;
Counterparty credit risk is the principal residual risk to the Corporation arising from liquid assets and borrowing activities. For over-&#13;
the-counter derivative financial instruments, the Corporation limits credit risk by restricting its transactions to a list of authorized&#13;
counterparties, placing limits on the volume of transactions with individual counterparties and negotiating collateral arrangements with&#13;
the counterparties. For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges,&#13;
contracts and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's o pen interest rate position in each contract.&#13;
Credit Risk in Client Risk Management Activities&#13;
IFC enables its clients to take advantage of certain asset and liability management tools involving derivative financial products, by&#13;
intermediating between market counterparties and its clients. Where it has done so, the Corporation minimilizes its credit risk exposure&#13;
by conducting credit appraisals of clients and minimizes its market risk by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market&#13;
counterparties.&#13;
Counterparty Credit Risk&#13;
IFC's credit policies restrict eligibility of counterparties and set diversification caps on exposure to individual counterparties, sovereigns&#13;
and countries. They are revised annually at the beginning of each fiscal year and approved by IFC's Finance Committee. During the year,&#13;
institution-specific limits are updated monthly based on changes in counterparty size and/or credit status.&#13;
IFC's extensive use of derivative financial instruments carries credit risk which arises from the potential for a counterparty to default at&#13;
a time when the derivative contract has a positive value to IFC. IFC measures derivatives exposure to counterparties in terms of "worst&#13;
case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables which are updated monthly to reflect market movements. IFC currently&#13;
restricts counterparty eligibility to banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of A. In order to limit exposure to counter-&#13;
parties, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net exposure exceeds certain&#13;
predetermined thresholds, which decreases as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates. Because counterparties can be downgraded&#13;
during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded&#13;
below investment grade.&#13;
Managing Operational Risk&#13;
Operational risk is the potential for losses arising from internal activities or externial events caused by breakdowns in informatioTn sys-&#13;
tems, communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing and the execution of legal, fiduciary&#13;
and agency responsibilities. IFC, like all financial institutions, is exposed to many types of operational risks. 'rhe Corporation seeks to&#13;
mitigate such risks by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is designed not only to identify the parameters of&#13;
various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. The Corporation has adopted the COSO' control frame-&#13;
work and a self-assessment methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls, and it has an ongoing program in place to&#13;
cover all significant operations. In each of the last three fiscal years. IJC has obtained an attestation report from its external auditors on its&#13;
assertion that as of June 30 of each of the fiscal years, its system of internal control over financial reporting met the criteria for effective&#13;
internal control described in COSO and that the Corporation's assertion is fairly stated in all material respects.&#13;
During the year ended lune 30. 1999 several ongoing initiatives emphasized the area of operational risk management, including the&#13;
adoption of a new information technology system to replace numerous systems in areas such as financial accounting and administrative&#13;
expense processing (the Systems Renewal Project). The Corporation has also recently appointed a new global custodian to centralize&#13;
custodianship of its liquid assets and equity portfolios and, therebv, to streamline and enhance existing controls and reporting.&#13;
1 COSO refers to the Internal ControL-Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway&#13;
Commission which was convened by the US Congress in response to the weLl-publicized irregularities that occurred in the financial sector&#13;
during the late 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic and Monetary Union in Europe&#13;
Since January 1, 1999, in the normal course of business as a multicurrency organization, IFC has been conducting Euro-denominated&#13;
transactions in pavinig and receiving, liquid asset investments, debt issuance and in its loan and equity investment portfolio activities.&#13;
IF( has adoptcd a gradual approachi to redenomiinlatinig nationial currency balance sheet items to Euro during the transitioni period. The&#13;
I       incremental cost of Euro conversion was immaterial to the Corporation's financial statements and has been included in the Corporation's&#13;
administrative expenses.&#13;
Year 2000 Issues&#13;
10      The Ycar 2000 issue is the result of computer programs and embedded process control chips using two digits rather than four to define&#13;
the applicable year. Information systems or automated process control devices that are unable to properly interpret dates beyond 1999&#13;
could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability&#13;
to process transactions correctly and promptly, a temporary failure of building internal infrastructure, or a temporary failure of one or&#13;
more public infrastructure segnents UpOIn whichI the business operations depend. Year 2000 issues affect the Corporation's hardware,&#13;
databases and software associated with critical financial and administrative automated information systems, the headquarters building&#13;
technical infrastructure, vendors, suppliers and contractors, and include the Year 2000 preparedness of IFC's client companies.&#13;
The primary goal of the Corporation's Year 2000 Project is to ensure that the Corporation's vital business processes will operate in the&#13;
next millennium by being Year 20()0 compliant. Additional goals are to protect IFC irom legal liability stemming from its own unpre-&#13;
paredness or that of vendors, suppliers and correspondent banks; to ensure that IFC client companies understand the nature and urgency&#13;
of the Year 2000 issue, and consequcnces of noncompliance; and to assist IFC client companies in dealing effectively with such issues.&#13;
'I'he Corporation's Year 2300 Project has been in active operation for more than two-and-a-half years. At present, IFC believes that the&#13;
Year 2000 Project is on schedule and sufficiently resourced. Regular mneetings with the Year 2000 Project Office are held and a monthly&#13;
report on the status of the project is provided to the Corporation's President and Management Group. Moreover, the Corporation's&#13;
MNanagement Group is apprised of the project's status through detailed quarterly reports, and semiannual reviews of the Year 2000 Project&#13;
are reviewed by the Corporation's Audit Committee.&#13;
T'he cost of completing the Corporation's Year 2000 program is estimated at approximately $3.0 million, including $2.0 million for client&#13;
companiy readiness assessments and related activity. In addition, the cost of the General Ledger Module portion of the aforementioned&#13;
Systems Renewal Project was $1.0 million.&#13;
IFC requires contingency plans for all mission-critical systems needing repair or replacement due to Year 2000 problems. For IFC's inter-&#13;
nal systems at headquarters, the contingency plan is to repair or replace the old application systems before end-June 1999. Most of IFC's&#13;
internal svstems have already been tested and found to be Year 2(000 compliant by design. Some of IFC's compliance activities are coordi-&#13;
nated w ith, and dependent upon, the Systems Renewal Project for the replacement of certain core administrative support systems. 1'his&#13;
project wvent into production as of July 15, 1999. Integration testing of all mission-critical systems is scheduled to be completed by the end&#13;
of August 1999. Moreover, the cut off date for normal modifications testing is December 1, 1999, after which all systems will be frozen&#13;
until end-January 2000.&#13;
IFC's iicld offices have been providecd with a Contingency Planniiig Guide to develop practical measures to ensure continuity of functions&#13;
and programs, based upon local country and regional risks. These plans address provisioning for continued office operations and staff&#13;
needs and were distributed in July 1999. 'The Corporation has encouraged all of its client companies to develop contingency plans, or&#13;
adapt existing plans, to prepare for this unique event. In the second half of August 1999 IFC will have issued a guideline monograph to&#13;
every client company in the investment portfolio. This serves to augment the overall awareness effort, and supplements previous Y2K-&#13;
related guidelines sent to clients (all with appropriate legal disclaimers).&#13;
VI. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
Il-C's net income can be seen as broadly comprising a spread on interest earning assets, income from the equity investment portfolio,&#13;
provisions for loan and eqIuitv investments, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Since the Corporation seeks to minimize its&#13;
exposure to currenicy and interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, the three main factors that affect net&#13;
income are the impact of nonaccruals and the interest collection rate on loan interest income; the performance of the equity portfolio;&#13;
and the level of provisions for losses on loan and equity investments. The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY99&#13;
and FY98.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Net Income&#13;
The Corporation's net income for FY99 was $249 million, marginally higher than FY98's net income of $246 million. In spite of the stable&#13;
overall level of net income, several components of net income have varied significantly in FY99 as compared with FY98.The decrease in&#13;
provisions for losses from $481 million to S333 million was offset by:&#13;
* the decrease in net interest income from S482 million to $469 million;&#13;
* the decrease in income from equity investments from $314 million to S265 million;&#13;
* the increase in noninterest expense from $230 million to $254 million; and&#13;
* the decrease in noninterest income (including the effect of the accounting change in FY98) from $160 million to $102 million.       K&#13;
Net Interest Income&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. With charges on borrowings taken into account,&#13;
net interest income declined by $13 million or 3% from $482 million in FY98 to $469 million in FY99.&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans for FY99 were $607 million, compared with $583 millioni for FY98, an increase of 4%. The growth in&#13;
the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio of 129/6 was substantially offset by a 3% reduction in interest collection rates resulting from&#13;
the growth in loans in nonaccrual status from $633 million at June 30, 1998 to $857 million at June 30, 1999.&#13;
Income from deposits and securities for FY99 was $532 million, slightly lower than the $550 million recorded in FY98. The liquid assets&#13;
portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, grew from $9.4 billion to $10.1 billion and interest rates rose, especially&#13;
during the second half of FY99. However, the S9 million increase in interest income, and a $12 million increase in realized gains in the&#13;
Corporation's trading portfolios, were offset by $22 million of realized losses in the available for sale portfolios ($17 million realized gains&#13;
in FY98). which primarily occurred on sales during the second half of FY99.&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings rose by $19 million during FY99 from $651 million to $670 million, reflecting a growth in the&#13;
borrowings portfolio (after the effect of associated derivative financial instruments), offset by a reduction in average borrowings costs.&#13;
Income from Equity Investments&#13;
The Corporation generated capital gains for FY99 of $166 million as compared with $217 million for FY98, a decline of 230%. Dividend&#13;
income was relatively stable at $99 million for FY99 as compared with $96 million for FY98. Overall income from the equity investment&#13;
portfolio declined by $49 million, or 16%, from S314 million in FY98 to $265 million in FY99.&#13;
During FY97 and the early part of FY98, IFC was able to liquidate a number of individual equity investment holdings to realize capital&#13;
gains due to a relatively strong environment in the emerging markets. Subsequent to various crises in late FY98 and early FY99, this trend&#13;
did not continue and led to the decline in realized capital gains in FY99.&#13;
Provisions for Losses&#13;
The income charge for provisions for losses of $333 million in FY99 was significantly lower than the historically high level of $481 million&#13;
in FY98, a decline of $148 million or 31/%. At June 30, 1999 the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loan and equity investments&#13;
were 18.2% of the disbursed and outstanding portfolio (I17.0%-Iune 30, 1998). Provisions were lower in FY99 because impairment dur-&#13;
ing FY99 was less severe than in FY98. This trend continued through FY99, so that provisions recorded during the second half of the year&#13;
were lower than in the first half ($73 million as compared with $26t) million).&#13;
Noninterest Income&#13;
Noninterest income of $102 million for FY99 was lower than FY98 ($160 million), principally due to the FY98 nonrecurring income of&#13;
$34 million resulting from the change in accounting for other postretirement benefits. Also contributing to the decline were lower service&#13;
fees of $33 million for FY99 as compared with $66 million for FY98. This was a result of less favorable market conditions for IFC's techni-&#13;
cal and advisory assistance services and resource mobilization services.&#13;
Offsetting these factors, there was an increase in income from the expected long-term return from Staff Retirement Plan assets and from&#13;
the change in the Corporation's share of net assets held for postretirement benefits, from $54 million in FY98 to $64 million in FY99.&#13;
Noninterest Expense&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) rose 170%o from $213 million in FY98 to $250 million in FY99.&#13;
This increase was in line with budget funding of the anticipated growth in the investment portfolio and the move into smaller invest-&#13;
ments in frontier countries within IFC's portfolio. In addition, the Corporation instigated a number of new initiatives in FY99 to fund&#13;
the Year 2000 Project, the implementation of the Euro and continued funding of its Africa Enterprise Fund and Small and Medium&#13;
Enterprise Fund.&#13;

Report of Independent Accountants&#13;
President and Board of Governors&#13;
International Finance Corporation&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Finance Corporation, as of June&#13;
30, 1999 and 1998, including the statements of capital stock and voting power, as of June 30, 1999, and&#13;
the related statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in capital and cash flows for the years&#13;
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the International Finance Corporation's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our&#13;
audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of&#13;
America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used&#13;
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of&#13;
the International Finance Corporation as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and&#13;
its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the&#13;
United States of America and with International Accounting Standards.&#13;

PURPOSE&#13;
:       I'he Interniationial Finance Corporation 'the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic&#13;
developmefat in its member countries bv encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of the World Bank&#13;
Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International D)evelopment&#13;
Association and the Multilateral Investnment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Corporation's activities are closely coordinated with and&#13;
conaplenent the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. The Corporation, together with private&#13;
investors, a,sists in finanicing the establishment, improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loan and equity&#13;
investments where sufficient private cap tal is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The Corporation's share capital is provided by&#13;
its membIIer counltries. It raises most of the funds for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securi-&#13;
ties in the internationial capital markets. The Corporation also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other&#13;
insvestors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan syndications. underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project&#13;
finance and resource mobilization, the (orporation offers an array of financial and technical advisory services to private businesses in the&#13;
developi ng world to increase their chances of success, and also advises governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the&#13;
growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
NOTE A-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
I'he accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States&#13;
(L'S (AAP) and with International Accountinig Standards (IAS).&#13;
Financial statements presentation-Certain amounts in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
Use of estimates-T[he preparationi of tne financial statements in conformity with US GAAP and 'AS requires management to make&#13;
estimates anad assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at&#13;
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of inconae and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could&#13;
differ fro:maa these cstimates. A significanit degree of Judgment has been used in the determination of the adequacy of the reserve against&#13;
losses, and in the determinationi of net periodic pension inconme. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation's&#13;
operations. The possibility exists that changing econiomic conditionis could have an adverse effect en the financial position of the&#13;
(.orporatioin.&#13;
Translation of currencies-Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
investnaents, are expressed in US dollarsat the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998. Disbursed equity investments&#13;
are expressed in lUS dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of&#13;
exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. 'I'ranslation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
Loan and equity investments-L.oan and equity investnaents are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loan investments are carried at the&#13;
prinicipal antounts outstanding. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral securitv such as, but not limited to, mortgages and&#13;
third-party guarantees. Equity investmuents are carried at cost. On occasion the Corporation enters into put and call option agreements&#13;
in connection with equity insvestnients.&#13;
Reserve against losses for loan and equity investments-The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current infor-&#13;
iamatioia and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loaia's contractual terms.&#13;
The reserve against losses for impaired loans represents naanagement's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows dis-&#13;
counted at the loan's effective interest rate. The Corporation estahlishes a reserve against losses for equity investments when a decrease in&#13;
valuc of the investnaents has occurred which is considered other than temporary. The reserve against losses for loan and equity invest-&#13;
iaierits iniludes an estimaate of potenltial losses oii loan and equity investmenits not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established&#13;
through annual charges to iiaconme in the form of a provision for losses on investmeiats. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent&#13;
recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
Revenue recognition on loan and equity investments-Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in&#13;
freely convertilble currencies. Gains on the sale of equity investmelnts are iaieasured against the average cost of the investrnents sold and are&#13;
recorded as iniconme wheni received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
Interest inconae and conianitnaent fees on loan investments are recorded as income on an accrual basis. All other fees are recorded as&#13;
inconme wshel received in freely convertible currenicies. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibilits is in&#13;
doubt or payrmaeiits ot iiilerest or principal are past due naore thafi 60 days uialess managermient aiaticipates that collection of interest will&#13;
occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized&#13;
as iriconac otly vs heni the actual payvnent is receixved. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is&#13;
recorded as deferred income and credited to income only when the related principal is received. Fee income and costs associated with loan&#13;
origiiaatioia are recognized whena incurred, as the net of these amounats is not material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Liquid assets-As part of its overall portfolio managenment strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to commercial banks and to obtain&#13;
higher returns, the Corporation invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-backed securities according to the&#13;
Corporation's credit risk and duration policies. Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and&#13;
other obligations issued or unconditionially guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agen-&#13;
cies and instrumentalities or bv multilateral organizations. The Corporation converts these fixed rate government and agency obligations&#13;
into variable rate US dollar instruments by entering into currency and interest rate swaps.&#13;
On July 1, 1997, the Corporation transferred $978 million of its securities classified as trading securities to the available for sale portfolio.&#13;
Securities classified as available for sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to maturity as part of asset and liability manage-  2&#13;
ment or in response to other factors, are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income.&#13;
Securities classified as trading are carried at market value with any changes in fair value reported in income from deposits and securities.&#13;
Interest and dividends on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in income from deposits and&#13;
securities. Realized gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale or trading, which are computed by the last-in first-out&#13;
method, are included in income from deposits and securities.&#13;
The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits, and securities classified as trading and available for sale (collectively, liquid&#13;
assets) as an element of liquidity in the statement of cash flows because of their nature and the Corporation's policies governing the level&#13;
and use of such investments.&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements-Repurchase agreemenits are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously&#13;
agrees to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party&#13;
purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Securities purchased&#13;
under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities payable for cash collateral received are valued at&#13;
cost, on the basis that cost approximates market value.&#13;
Borrowings-To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and&#13;
uses a number of borrowing structures, including inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation simultaneously&#13;
converts such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under&#13;
certain outstanding borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other&#13;
than purchase money security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
Derivative financial instruments-In the normal course of business, the Corporation is a partv to derivative financial instruments with&#13;
off-balance-sheet risk used to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates. These instruments include currency and&#13;
interest rate swaps, covered forwards, commodity-indexed swaps, comm1lodity-incdexed options anid forward contracts on its own behalf&#13;
and for clients, guarantees for third parties, futures contracts and short sales. In addition, the Corporation issues warrants, and purchases&#13;
matching over-the-counter options to hedge these transactions.&#13;
Except for those related to deposits and securities, derivative financial instruments are accounted for on the accrual basis. Income or&#13;
expense are recognized over the life of the associated instrument as an element of charges on borrowings or service fees, depending on the&#13;
purpose for which the financial instrument associated with the derivative financial instrument is used. Derivative financial instruments&#13;
associated with the trading and available for sale portfolios are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, consistent with the recording of&#13;
the underlying financial instrument.&#13;
The cash settlement value of warrants and associated options are reported gross on the balance sheet and are included in receivables and&#13;
other assets and payables and other liabilities. Income and expense from warrants and associated options are recognized as an element of&#13;
charges on borrowings.&#13;
Intermediation services-Where it acts as an intermediary on currency and interest rate swaps, options, or forward contracts, the&#13;
Corporation miniimizes its exposure to credit risk by performing credit reviews of the clients and minimizes its exposure to currency&#13;
and interest rate risks by entering into offsetting swap, option, or forward contract positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
Resource mobilization-The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other finanicial institutions (Participants)&#13;
through loan participations which are sold by the Corporation, without recourse, to Participants. These loan participations are adminis-&#13;
tered and serviced by the Corporation on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations&#13;
are not included in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
Introduction of the Euro-Effective January 1, 1999 eleven member states of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common&#13;
currency and the European Currenicy Unit was automatically redenominated into the Euro. Amounts stated in Euros appearing herein&#13;
for both the current and prior periods have been recast from the legacy currencies regardless of the timing of the redenomination of the&#13;
instruments concerned. Recasting has had no impact on the TS dollar equivalents reported in these financial statements, except insofar&#13;
as in the footnotes that disclose currency analvses of balance sheet amounts legacy currency items have been aggregated and single Euro&#13;
amounts are disclosed in their place. Caution is advised when analyzing the information in the footnotes concerned as the data may not&#13;
be readily comparable to similar data disclosed by other organizations in similar footnotes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Accounting and reporting developments-In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 125, Accountingfor Transfers ofAssets and Servicing ofFinancialAssets andExtinguishments&#13;
of Liabilities, which requires new accounting and reporting standards for sales, securitizations and servicing of receivables and other&#13;
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. The Standard was effective beginning in 1997 and had no material impact on the&#13;
Corporation's financial statements upon adoption. The provisions relating to transfers involving repurchase and resale agreements and&#13;
securities lending for transfers of financial assets were effective in 1998. The adoption of these provisions of the Standard had no material&#13;
impact on1 the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
22     In February, 1997, FASB issued SFAS No. 129, Disclosure ofInformation about Capital Structure. The Statemelnt establishes standards&#13;
for disclosing information about an entity's capital structure, Adoption of this Standard by the Corporation on July 1, 1998 did not have&#13;
a material impact on the Corporation's results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In June 1997, FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The Standard establishes standards for the reporting and pre-&#13;
sentation of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. SFAS No. 130 defines comprehensive income as the&#13;
change in equitv excluding transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive income has two major components: net income and other&#13;
comprehensive income. Other comaprehensive income comprises unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. Adoption of&#13;
this Standard by the Corporation on July 1, 1998 did not have a material impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or&#13;
financial position.&#13;
In June 1997 FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments ofan Enterprise and Relatedlnformation. The Standard establishes the&#13;
criteria for determining an operating segment and the related financial information disclosure required. It also establishes standards for&#13;
disclosing related information regarding products and services, geographic areas and major customers. In August 1997, IASC issued IAS&#13;
No. 14 'revised), Segment Reporting, which requires disclosure of similar information. These Standards are effective for the Corporation's&#13;
financial statemenits for the year ended June 30, 1999. Adoption of these Standards did not have a material impact on the Corporation's&#13;
reported results of operations or financial position. Refer to footnote N for further information.&#13;
In August 1997, IASC issued IAS No. I (revised), Presentation ofFinancial Statements. [AS No. I (revised) is designed to improve the qual-&#13;
ity of financial statements presented using International Accounting Standards by providing guidance on the structure of financial state-&#13;
ments and establishing certain practical requirements. This Standard is effective for the year ended June 30, 1999 for the Corporation.&#13;
Adoption of this Standard did not have a material impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In February 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This Statement revises&#13;
employers' disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits. It requires additional information on changes in the benefit&#13;
obligations and fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis, and eliminates certain disclosures. T'his Standard has been&#13;
given effect in the Corporation's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 1999. Adoption of this Statement did not have a material&#13;
impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In February 1998, [ASC issued lAS No. 19 (revised), Employer Benefits. The Standard prescribes the accounting and disclosure by employ-&#13;
ers for employee benefits. The Standard is effective for the year ending June 30, 2000 for the Corporation. Adoption of this Standard did&#13;
not have a material impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In February 1998, IASC issued IAS No. 34, Interim Financial Reporting. The Standard defines the minimum content of interim financial&#13;
reporting and identifies the accounting recognition and measurement principles that should be applied in an interim report. The&#13;
Standardl is effective for the year ending June 30, 2000 for the Corporation. Adoption of this Standard is not expected to have a material&#13;
imipact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In June 1998, IASC issued IAS No. 36, Impairment ofAssets. The Standard requires that the recoverable amount of an asset should be esti-&#13;
mated whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The Standard is effective for the year ending June 30, 2000 for the&#13;
Corporation. Adoption of this Standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or&#13;
financial position.&#13;
In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accountingfor Derivative Instruments and HedgingActivities. The Standard establishes accounting&#13;
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedg-&#13;
ing activities. It requires a company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to&#13;
measure those instruments at fair value. 'I'his Standard is effective for the year ending June 30, 2001 for the Corporation. The Corporation&#13;
has not completed the process of evaluating the impact that will result from the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and is, therefore, unable to dis-&#13;
close the impact that adoption of this Standard will have on the Corporation's results of operations or financial position.&#13;
In September 1998, the IASC issued IAS No. 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and ContingentAssets. The Standard prescribes the&#13;
accounting and disclosure for most provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. It requires provisions to be recognized when&#13;
the enterprise has a present obligation from which an outflow of resources is probable, and the amount of the outflow can be reasonably&#13;
estimated. Contingent liabilities are to be recognized when their occurrence is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably&#13;
measured. Contingent assets are generally not recognized. The Standard is effective for the year ending June 30, 2000 for the Corporation.&#13;
Adoption of this Standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's reported results of operations or financial position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In March 1999, the IASC issued IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement. The Standard prescribes balance sheet&#13;
recognition of all financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivatives. It requires financial assets and financial liabilities to be&#13;
initially measured at cost, and to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet thereafter. The Standard is effective for the Corporation for&#13;
the year ending June 30, 2002; however, early application is permitted. The Corporation has not completed the process of evaluating the&#13;
impact that will result from the adoption of IAS No. 39 and is, therefore, unable to disclose the impact that adoption of this Standard will&#13;
have on the Corporation's results of operations or financial position.&#13;

11 S     NOTE J-CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPECIAL PROGRAMS&#13;
From timne to time, the Board of Directors approves recommendations under which the Corporation contributes to special programs,&#13;
which presently are the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF), the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF), the Foreign Investment&#13;
Advisory Service (FIAS), the Enterprise Support Services for Africa (ESSA), and the Mekong Project Development Facility (MPDF).&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 1999, the Corporation contributed $3.4 million to these facilities ($4.0 million-year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
NOTE K-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT RISK&#13;
Derivative financial instruments involve elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet. The&#13;
30     contractual or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Corporation's involvement in such instruments. Credit risk&#13;
represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the&#13;
contract. Market risk represents the potential loss due to a decrease in the value of a derivative financial instrument caused primarily by&#13;
changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates. The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by coun-&#13;
terparties for currency swaps and guarantees is represented by the contractual or notional amounts of these instruments. For interest rate&#13;
swaps, covered forwards, futures and option contracts, commodity-indexed contracts, interest rate caps and guarantees on swaps, the&#13;
contractual or notional amounts do not represent exposure to credit loss.&#13;
The Corporation is highly selective in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance to represent a significant risk. For&#13;
derivative financial instruments, the Corporation limits activity to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties. Credit limits have been&#13;
established for each counterparty by type of instrument and maturity category and collateral agreements have been executed with counter-&#13;
parties in order to further minimize the Corporation's exposure to credit risk. Under these agreements, the Corporation may accept collat-&#13;
eral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.&#13;

NOTE L-ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments lack a trading market, characterized as exchanges between willing buyers and sellers.&#13;
Accordingly, subjective estimates and present value calculations of future cash flows were used to estimate the fair values. Determining&#13;
future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptions or methodologies may&#13;
materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values&#13;
presented do not necessarily reflect the realizable values since the Corporation generally holds loans and other financial instruments&#13;
to maturity with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998 but not the effects of interest rate&#13;
fluctuations for any period preceding or following those dates. In different interest rate environments, fair value results can differ signifi-&#13;
cantly, especially for certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not&#13;
likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of sec-&#13;
ondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or&#13;
estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in&#13;
using this data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instru-&#13;
ments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I'he imethodolo]gies used and kev assumptions maide to estimate fair values as of June 30, 1999 and 1998 are summarized below:&#13;
Liquid assets-The estimated fair value of the time deposits and the trading and available for sale securities portfolios are based on&#13;
:       quoted market prices and the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
Derivative financial instruments-Fair values for interest rate and currency swaps were derived by determining the present value&#13;
of estimated futuLre cash flows using appropriate discount rates. Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market&#13;
forward exchange rates. Fair values for commodity-indexed contracts and call options were based on pricing models. Fair value for put&#13;
warrants was based on quoted market prices.&#13;
32      Loan investments and commitments-The Corporation, which extends loans to entities operating in the private sector in its developing&#13;
member countries, generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair values for fixed&#13;
rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed rate&#13;
loan spread plus the year end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on&#13;
a quarterly or six monthly basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The&#13;
Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options&#13;
are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
Equity investments-Fair values were determined using market prices where available, put option prices, book values or cost, certain&#13;
of which were discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate&#13;
valuation techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Management's estimate of fair value&#13;
takes irito consideration the relative illiquiditv and volatility, as well as the overall business constraints, in the emerging markets in which&#13;
the Corporation invests.&#13;
Borrowings and commitments-Fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on rates representinig the&#13;
Corporation's estimated year end cost to raise funds with similar terms and remaining maturities.&#13;
Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial instruments are summarized below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE M-CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
The Corporation conducts its operations for its loans, deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. The Corporation's&#13;
policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-&#13;
equity investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. The Corporation's equity investments in enterprises located in its&#13;
developing member countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, the Corporation carries the&#13;
currency risk of equity investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

Of the $1,028 million prepaid SRP cost at June 30, 1999 ($553 million-June 30, 1998), $133 million is attributable to the Corporation&#13;
($69 million-June 30, 1998) and is included in receivables and other assets.&#13;
The underlying actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience and management's best estimate&#13;
of future benefit changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations. The&#13;
weighted average assumptions used in determining expense and benefit obligations are as follows (%):&#13;

Discount rate                                                                                    7.25                    6.50&#13;

The effect of projected compensation levels was calculated based on a scale that provides for a decreasing rate of salary increase depending&#13;
on age, beginning with 11.75% (11.00%-June 30, 1998) at age 20 and decreasing to 5.25% (4.50%-June 30,1998) at age 64.&#13;

NOTE P-OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
V Other postretirement benefits are also provided for eligible active and retired WNorld Bank Group staff, including those of the&#13;
Corporation, through a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post Employment Benefits Plan (PBEP).&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 1998 the Wlorld Bank Group reviewed the status of the RSBP and PBEP accounts and determined that the&#13;
assets and liabilities did not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting. At June 30, 1998 the assets and liabilities were recorded on IBRD's&#13;
balance sheet. The Corporation included a receivable from IBRD of 572.0 million in receivables and other assets relating to its share of&#13;
these postretirement benefits net assets, representing a prepaid postretirement benefits cost, resulting in income to the Corporation for&#13;
36     the year ended June 30, 1998 of $45.7 million. Of this amount, $15.9 million related to the cumulative effect of prior periods on retained&#13;
earnings at June 30, 1997 and has been included in effect of accounting change in the income statement.&#13;
During the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, the postretirement benefits plans were modified so that some of the assets designated for&#13;
other postretirement benefits met the requirements for plan assets prescribed under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement&#13;
Benefits Other than Pensions. Accordingly, those plan assets and liabilities were removed from IBRD's balance sheet, and the Corporation's&#13;
receivable from IBRD was reduced accordingly. At June 30, 1999 the receivable from IBRD included in receivables and other assets was&#13;
$17.7 million. Expense from the decrease in the Corporation's share of plan net assets, included in increase (decrease) in share of net&#13;
assets held for postretirement benefits, wgas $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 1999.&#13;
NOTE O-SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently&#13;
provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, inter-&#13;
nal auditing, administrative support, supplies and insurance. Payments for these services are made by the Corporation to IBRD based on&#13;
negotiated fees, chargebacks, and allocated charges where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to the Corporation for the year&#13;
ended June 30, 1999 were $16.5 million ($14.4 million-year ended June 30, 1998).&#13;
NOTE R-TRUST FUNDS&#13;
'The Corporation uses the services of IBRD to administer funds on behalf of donors which are restricted for specific uses which include&#13;
technical assistance, feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and research and training programs. These&#13;
funds are placed in trust and are not included in the Corporation's assets. The responsibilities of the Corporation are to arrange for ser-&#13;
vices generally not otherwise provided by it including full project implementation and procurement of goods and services. The distribu-&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 1999
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report concerns the annual review
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 1999. IFC earned $249 million in net income in fiscal
            year 1999, above the $246 million earned in fiscal year 1998
            but below the record net income of $432 million achieved in
            FY97. Loan portfolio performance showed a small profit of
            $10 million in FY99. IFC's committed portfolio at the
            end of fiscal year 1999 increased by 12.8 percent to $12.9
            billion, from $11.5 billion in FY98, of which nearly 76
            percent was in loans amounting $9.8 billion and 24 percent
            was in equity investments amounting to $3.1 billion. In
            addition, IFC held and managed for participants $8.3 billion
            in loans it had syndicated. Over the next year, IFC will
            make organizational changes to clarify roles and
            responsibilities. New cross-organizational structures will
            allow IFC's transactional experience to be better
            integrated into the policy advice the World Bank provides to
            governments, while ensuring that any potential conflicts of
            interest are effectively managed. Since small and
            medium-sized enterprises represent a majority of economic
            activity in member countries, IFC will offer policy advice
            for start-ups and growth and to encourage private
            intermediaries to make needed financing available.
