For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;

the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 1,250&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 67&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 67*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        Resolution # 252, the issuance of Architectural Planning&#13;
        Conditions (APU) shall be conducted according to One-Stop-&#13;
        Shop principle. The list of documents required for issuance of&#13;
        APU was reduced. In particular, a business is only expected to&#13;
        complete an established application form which contains&#13;
        information on the type of upcoming construction and submit it&#13;
        along with the following documents: copy of the land title that&#13;
        verifies that a land plot was purchased or leased, letter of&#13;
        attorney, and invoice on advanced payment (advance payment is&#13;
   1    required while obtaining an APU, the remainder is paid after a           28 days               KGS 18,500&#13;
        business receives the APU).&#13;
&#13;
        A territorial architecture and construction body, within 3 business&#13;
        days, performs the check for compliance of an application form&#13;
        with requirements set by urban planning documentation. In case&#13;
        of non-compliance, the territorial architecture and construction&#13;
        body issues a Report on Non-compliance of Construction and&#13;
        returns the application without approval. In each case the body is&#13;
        obliged to indicate the established types of permitted land use&#13;
        pursuant to the urban planning documentation.&#13;
&#13;
        In case the territorial architecture and construction body&#13;
        approves the application, it submits the application for further&#13;
        approval to the sanitary and epidemiology body, fire authority,&#13;
        and environmental authority. After that, the application is&#13;
        forwarded to the utilities companies by the main coordinating&#13;

      As of February 12, 2009, Government Resolution #121&#13;
      introduced amendments to the Regulation â&#128;&#156;On Order for Issuing&#13;
      Permits for Project Designs, Construction and Real Estate&#13;
      Modification and Order for Commissioning Completed Building&#13;
      the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#157; approved by Government of KR on May 30,&#13;
      2008, by Resolution #252. There are now only two technical&#13;
      conditions that must be obtained in a compulsory manner --&#13;
      water/ sewage and electricity. The remaining communications&#13;
      can be obtained on a voluntary basis by applicants and are not&#13;
      linked to obtaining the architectural planning conditions.&#13;
      Meanwhile, if the applicant suggests alternative solutions to&#13;
      connecting to engineering facilities, then requests for technical&#13;
      conditions are not filed at all. Based on the functional purpose of&#13;
      the building, approvals from sanitary and fire authorities are&#13;
      applied using a risk-based system. Simple objects would not&#13;
      require approvals from these authorities.&#13;
&#13;
      Additionally, requirements for documents to be submitted along&#13;
      with the application have been clarified. These administrative&#13;
      simplifications made the process of issuance of architectural&#13;
      planning conditions faster and possible to comply within the&#13;
      time-limit of 20 working days (28 calendar days).&#13;
&#13;
      Despite reforms in disclosing the information on fee schedules,&#13;
      the process of cost calculation for this procedure remains&#13;
      nontransparent.&#13;
&#13;
      The payment can be made at the counter of State Architecture&#13;
      Department of Bishkek City. Then the shares of each respective&#13;
      utility provider are transferred without BuildCo visiting each&#13;
      separately.&#13;
&#13;
      APU is executed in two copies - one is issued to the applicant&#13;
      and the other is filed with the architecture and construction&#13;

      Request approval of project, expertise of project documents&#13;
      and obtain building permit&#13;
&#13;
      This procedure consists of three stages: approval of project&#13;
      documents, expertise of documents and issuance of building&#13;
      permit. All three stages are done under the one-stop shop&#13;
      principle. A single application is filed by the applicant to obtain&#13;
      all these approvals.&#13;
&#13;
      The approval of project documents consists of two stages: initial&#13;
      review of drawings and plans and other relevant chapters of the&#13;
      projects is done by the territorial branch of State Architecture&#13;
      Department. BuildCo submits at this stage its application along&#13;
      with the following documents:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Project documents (drawings, plans); private projects are not&#13;
      required to submit any financial segment of the project&#13;
      (abolished by the Resolution #252)&#13;

      State Agency of Architecture and Construction and other&#13;

      assessment of objects no lower than two stories, stating the&#13;
      possibility of reconstructing, re-profiling or re-planning of&#13;
      objects (for construction permit). Any other documents are&#13;
      considered illegal.&#13;
&#13;
      The authority must issue its approval within 10 working days.&#13;
&#13;
      Following that it will send two copies of all documents for review&#13;
      by the State Expertise Authority. According to Resolution #252&#13;
      (30.05.2008), and Government Resolution #75 as of February 4,&#13;
      2009, the expertise can be conducted by private companies, but&#13;
      until now there has not been a single license issued for expertise&#13;
      works.&#13;
&#13;
      The nature of the expert assessment has been changed as well.&#13;
      In the past, the expert assessment was focused on the cost&#13;
      estimate of the project, which is prohibited by the above-&#13;
      mentioned regulation.&#13;
&#13;
      The expert assessment of the project design documents is&#13;
      conducted by the State Expertise Authority and its territorial&#13;
      bodies or privately licensed companies to check the following&#13;
      aspects:&#13;

      the bearing structure of buildings&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Checking the results of the geotechnical survey&#13;
&#13;
      Based on the results of the conducted expert assessment, the&#13;
      State Expertise Authority prepares a report on compliance of the&#13;
      project design documents with normative requirements. In case&#13;
      of any irregularities, the State Expertise Authority prepares&#13;
      another report on bringing the project design documentation in&#13;
      compliance which identifies the irregularities or a report on&#13;
      refusal of approving the project design.&#13;
&#13;
      Under current legislation there are categories of objects that do&#13;
      not require state expert assessment. There are notions of&#13;
      mandatory and voluntary expert assessment and possibility for&#13;
      expert assessment of project documentation by private experts&#13;
      or organizations. BuildCoâ&#128;&#153;s case would qualify for the expert&#13;
      assessment.&#13;
&#13;
      No later than one day following the approval date, which is 20&#13;
      working days for projects higher than 1000 sq. m., the report&#13;
      with the positive expert assessment is submitted to State&#13;
      Architecture and Construction Supervision for issuing a&#13;
      construction permit.&#13;
&#13;
      The State Architecture and Construction Supervision has to issue&#13;
      the building permit within 10 working days. Otherwise, the&#13;
      silence-is-consent principle applies. However, in practice the&#13;
      State Architecture and Construction Supervision does not accept&#13;
      silence as consent rule. Amendments regarding construction&#13;
      supervision process were made to Law â&#128;&#156;On Changes to Law of&#13;

      and Government Resolution #95 â&#128;&#156;On approving the Order on&#13;
      Classification of Construction Object Characteristics and Order of&#13;
      Conducting State Architecture-Construction Supervision,&#13;
      Reconstruction and Other Real Estate Objects in the Kyrgyz&#13;
      Republic.â&#128;&#157; According to these reforms the building supervision&#13;
      process is now based on a risk-based approach. Compulsory&#13;
      state control over the building process is applied for buildings&#13;
      that fall into high-risk category. Low-risk categories (i.e.,&#13;
      buildings less than 1,350 sq. m.) are now subject to author and&#13;
      technical supervision and do not require state supervision. Thus,&#13;
      it removes the need for signing a special contract with State&#13;
      Architecture and Construction Supervision and paying the&#13;
      respective fees. Both author and technical supervision can be&#13;
      done by BuildCo staff.&#13;
&#13;
      At the time of issuing the building permit, BuildCo will receive a&#13;
      schedule of inspections to be carried out by State Architecture&#13;
      and Construction Supervision. The inspections will take place&#13;
      three times: foundation works, structure and a final inspection.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Kyrgyz Republic
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Kyrgyz
            Republic. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 Kyrgyz Republic ranks 67. A high ease of
            doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is
            more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
