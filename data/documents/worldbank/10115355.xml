Who is Going to Drill&#13;
the African Boreholes?&#13;
Entrepreneurs in the Rural Water Supply Sub-sector&#13;
&#13;
Private drillers form an essential segment of the borehole drilling sector in Africa. More needs to be known&#13;
about their abilities and the contribution they can make. Case studies of entrepreneurial drilling companies&#13;
in four African countries are used to illustrate business strategies and common constraints, and possible&#13;
ways forward.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Thousands of water supply&#13;
boreholes need to be drilled in&#13;
Africa. These new boreholes will be&#13;
central to increased water supply&#13;
coverage in many African countries&#13;
so an effective drilling sector is&#13;
intimately linked to the achievement&#13;
of their Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDGs) by 2015 for water&#13;
supply. This Field Note tackles the&#13;
important question raised in its&#13;
title which is who is going to drill all&#13;
those African boreholes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
External support agencies have&#13;
tried to build drilling capacity in&#13;
government agencies and NGOs,&#13;
but most now admit that this&#13;
approach has not worked, and&#13;
are turning to the private sector&#13;
for solutions. However, the life of&#13;
the private borehole driller is not&#13;
well known or understood, as it is&#13;
mostly played out in remote and&#13;
inhospitable corners of the world,&#13;
far from the eyes of donors and&#13;
government regulators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is hoped that information from&#13;
four case studies of four successful&#13;
pioneering companies in this&#13;
Field Note will encourage sector&#13;
stakeholders to develop stronger&#13;
relationships with, and provide&#13;
appropriate support to, these            Drilling in Ethiopia&#13;

&#13;
Lack of working capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A lack of investment and working capital&#13;
was the most serious complaint. Drilling&#13;
rigs, especially DTH hammer rigs, are&#13;
extremely expensive to buy, and have&#13;
significant operation and maintenance&#13;
costs. In addition, drilling contracts&#13;
are often based on payment for work&#13;
completed so contractors require&#13;
substantial cash reserves (or credit)&#13;
to buy materials, mobilise equipment,&#13;
operate rigs, and pay salaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These capital constraints make it&#13;
difficult and expensive for private&#13;
operators to enter the drilling market.       Sudan road conditions&#13;

&#13;
mechanical skills to keep everything&#13;
running. Strategically this suits JB&#13;
Drilling (Sudan) as it has built up strong&#13;
technical capacity during 25 years of&#13;
working in dangerous and inhospitable&#13;
areas. It also has preferential&#13;
access to good quality secondhand&#13;
equipment through its American drilling&#13;
connections and comprehensive&#13;
knowledge of the international market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. The anything-but-government&#13;
strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Often public sector drilling contracts&#13;
have a lack of transparency in bidding&#13;
processes and together with payment&#13;
delays discourage the contractor&#13;
from bidding for government work.&#13;
This leads the contractor to focus on&#13;
winning contracts from international&#13;
NGOs and donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This approach relies on the contractor&#13;
being known to donors and the level&#13;
of competition. In the case of Fatigen&#13;
Drilling (Nig) Ltd, prior work for NGOs&#13;
like WaterAid ensured that it was in&#13;
the right place when DFID decided to&#13;
experiment by loaning its drilling rig to&#13;
a private company. The management&#13;
of the rig and the guaranteed stream&#13;
of work enabled Fatigen to build up&#13;
its business and further enhance its         BushProof - Canzee Handpump&#13;

experience managing its projects in&#13;
Sudan, and eventually realized that it&#13;
could be opened up as a commercial&#13;
service to like-minded drilling outfits.&#13;
MEDIC was already well-known and&#13;
well-respected in South Sudan and&#13;
trusted to provide a useful and cost-&#13;
effective service to local drillers. Any&#13;
new unit would first have to establish its&#13;
credentials before independent-minded&#13;
private drillers would be willing to pay for&#13;
its services.&#13;

&#13;
2. Create aggregated drilling&#13;
contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From the drillers' perspective,&#13;
governments and donors should try to&#13;
package boreholes into larger clusters&#13;
of 10­50 wells so that contractors can&#13;
work more efficiently and tender lower&#13;
prices. In the context of the complexity&#13;
of decentralized local governments           discounts on each borehole. This would     encourage them to work together for&#13;
&#13;
trying to work together to package           ensure that the loan is paid back by the   the common good. In this sector, the&#13;
&#13;

            Thousands of water supply boreholes need
            to be drilled in Africa. These new boreholes will be central
            to increased water supply coverage in many African countries
            so an effective drilling sector is intimately linked to the
            achievement of their millennium development goals (MDGs) by
            2015 for water supply. This field note tackles the important
            question raised in its title which is who is going to drill
            all those African boreholes.
