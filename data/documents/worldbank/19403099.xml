the Republic of Kenya&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of the&#13;
International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its recommendation pursuant to&#13;
said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to the Republic of Kenya an additional&#13;
credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 132,600,000. The purpose of said additional credit is to provide&#13;
additional funds to supplement the financial assistance furnished by the Association under the Financing&#13;
Agreement, dated May 23, 2011, between the Republic of Kenya and the Association, for Transport Sector&#13;
Support Project, the objectives of which are to: (a) increase the efficiency of road transport along the&#13;
Northern Corridor and the Tanzania-Kenya-Sudan road corridor; (b) enhance aviation safety and security to&#13;
meet international standards; (c) improve the institutional arrangements and capacity in the transport sector;&#13;
(d) restore the capacity of the international passenger terminal destroyed in a fire at Jomo Kenyata&#13;
International Airport; and (e) strengthen the capacity of Kenya Airports Authority in disaster preparedness&#13;
and responsiveness at Kenyan airports.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project in support of which the proceeds of such additional&#13;
financing are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I&#13;
of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Republic of Kenya and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of Kenya.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project continues to merit financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such additional assistance.&#13;
