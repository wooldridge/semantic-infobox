&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

stakeholders in the water supply subsectors, sharing this       public financial management, but without an agreed sector&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Build districtsâ&#128;&#153; capacity in terms of the quantity and skills of staff, to the level required to attain sector targets.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop a sector investment plan to guide the balance of investment to each of the subsectors, as urban water&#13;
     supply and sanitation are currently significantly underfunded relative to requirements.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Utilize modern communication technologies (for example, a user-friendly website), to promote a standard and&#13;
     â&#128;&#152;officialâ&#128;&#153; set of figures and performance assessments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Encourage donors to join harmonized procedures and to pool funding for rural water supply.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Publish a national inventory for RWS, including access rates and strategic ratios.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Develop technical assistance support for private operators of rural schemes.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Closely monitor O&amp;M performance by RWS operators, to ensure long-term sustainability of water services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Undertake reform and revise tariff to improve operational performance and ensure financial viability of urban water&#13;
     services under the newly established EWSA.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Update water supply master plan for Kigali taking into account urban growth and projected settlement patterns.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Promote investment in urban water supply to expand production capacity and expand and rationalize distribution&#13;
     network.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop pro-poor programs to serve low-income households including improved management of public kiosks and&#13;
     social connections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Establish district-level surveys of access and need, to better monitor equity.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Carry out research into appropriate technologies, aiming at a large-scale transition from traditional to hygienic&#13;
       latrines at affordable cost to households.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Encourage all projects to follow sector policy on user contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop an action plan for Kigali, adapted to Millennium Development Goal targets, and based on on-site sanitation&#13;
     for the medium term in line with sanitation master plan.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop private sector involvement in both hygiene promotion and on-site sanitation (latrine equipment, cheaper&#13;
     septic tanks, emptying trucks, and safe dumping sites).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve coordination between MVK (that is, Kigali Town Municipality) and the new utility, Rwanda Water and&#13;
     Sewerage Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                      3&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Rwanda and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                              The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s estimates and targets are derived from&#13;
                                                               national infrastructure surveys, published since 1992.3&#13;
From baseline coverage rates of 64 percent for improved        They provide estimates of the population served relative to&#13;

Rwanda has made progress over the past decade, leaving         by each facility (â&#128;&#152;provider dataâ&#128;&#153;). The CSO2 also compares&#13;
a relatively modest gap to reach the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2015         countriesâ&#128;&#153; own estimates of coverage with data from the&#13;
targets (Figure 1). According to government data, improved     UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP).4 Unlike&#13;
water supply coverage fell to 39 percent following the         government estimates, JMP data is based on household&#13;

An estimate of the investment required to meet the                        million per year (Figure 2 and Table 1). Users are expected&#13;
national 2015 targets was developed using the CSO2                        to bear around 70 percent of costs in rural and urban areas&#13;
costing model, using data on coverage, technology mix,                    (on-site sanitation remaining dominant for the period),&#13;
unit costs, and other variables gathered in 2009, (due to                 but this will require sufficient inputs from government&#13;
the need for shared baselines and benchmarking across                     and donors to leverage household funds. With US$9&#13;

model allows estimated capital investment requirements                    investments (US$8 million of which is for rural sanitation),&#13;
to be compared with anticipated public investment, and                    a US$9 million per year deficit remains, mainly in the&#13;
the assumed contribution from households (Figure 2).6                     urban sanitation subsector. Given the rapid population&#13;

and the costing results were validated by a Ministry of                   more sophisticated and expensive sanitation technology&#13;

The financing requirement based on national targets&#13;
shows that expanding coverage of improved water supply                    The above figures are based on Government of Rwanda&#13;
to 0.425 million people per year7 will require an estimated               coverage data, and their version of the MDG targets for&#13;
annual capital investment (CAPEX) of US$54 million                        2015. If the costing is repeated using coverage and MDG&#13;
(Figure 2 and Table 1). Of this US$2 million per year is                  targets derived from the JMP 2010 Report, the investment&#13;
expected to be contributed by households (5 percent                       requirement would be around 17 percent higher for water&#13;
contribution in rural areas; no user contribution in urban                supply, and 20 percent lower for sanitation (2 percent&#13;
areas), leveraged by the US$34 million per year anticipated               more overall). This is due more to differences in estimates&#13;
in public investment (domestic and donor). This leaves a                  of current coverage between the government and JMP,&#13;
funding gap of US$18 million per year, even assuming that                 than differences in their versions of the MDG targets,&#13;
funds can be allocated optimally between rural and urban                  which are slight (see Figure 1).&#13;

While the rural water supply sector began to take shape in        Moving downstream along the service delivery pathway,&#13;
the 1960s, and an urban utility was created in 1976, the          reforms to enhance development of new services on the&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Rwanda has made good progress in
            extending water supply and sanitation coverage during the
            past few years, under clear political commitment to three
            complementary sets of targets: the economic development and
            poverty reduction strategy (2012), millennium development
            goals (2015), and vision 2020. The report aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. Rwanda is closing
            the gap on its targets, but is unlikely to attain the
            required coverage levels by 2015 without an increase in
            financing. The coverage trend over the past 10 years for
            rural water supply demonstrates the country's capacity
            for developing new projects; while for sanitation the
            enabling environment and capacity for service development
            will need to be strengthened further in the medium term.
            Households' capacity for sharing the costs of water
            supply capital investments is limited, and the strategy
            views their main contribution as being towards operations
            and maintenance costs, through water fees and tariffs. The
            rural water supply subsector has switched from a community
            management model, to one of public-private partnership.
            Nearly 30 percent of rural water schemes are already managed
            by private operators and the economic and poverty reduction
            strategy aims for 50 percent by 2012. This second African
            Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) Country Status
            Overview (CSO2) has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Rwanda and other stakeholders.
