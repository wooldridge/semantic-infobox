&#13;
&#13;
A major medium-term risk for the economy               Russia will continue to depend on natural&#13;

costs of funding rise, credit levels decline, and      prospects, particularly given restricted access to&#13;
more loans default. Given the slowdown of the          external financing. Specifically, less foreign direct&#13;
economy, the result could be a vicious cycle of        investment could limit the transfer of innovation&#13;

and a tightening of access to credit. But there        Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth potential; and (iii) Finally, as&#13;
are more fundamental factors that could limit          long as access to external finance continues to&#13;

leads to significant variation in how the rules&#13;

The impact of sanctions is likely to linger for        60 percent. The current World Bank baseline&#13;
a long time. As lessons from international             outlook, however, sees the national poverty rate&#13;
experience demonstrate, sanctions could well           increasing from 10.8 percent in 2013 to 14.2&#13;

a shift in orientation away from Europe and            1998-1999 crisis. Russia weathered the 2008-&#13;

protectionist direction, with a growing footprint      vulnerable is likely to be less generous than it was&#13;
of the state on the economy. But no matter what        during the 2008-2009 crisis. Although people at&#13;

risks related to how to successfully adjust to the     most vulnerable, there will be less opportunity&#13;

R   ussia avoided a recession in 2014. The modest growth of 0.6 percent lacked momentum, with&#13;
    seasonally adjusted quarterly growth persistently near zero. In addition to the structural&#13;
slowdown that began in 2012, Russia had to internalize two major events. The first was a terms-&#13;
of-trade shock when oil prices more than halved between July and December 2014. The ensuing&#13;
ruble depreciation and monetary tightening made credit scarce and expensive, further dampening&#13;
domestic demand. The second shock was related to the geopolitical tensions that began in March&#13;
2014 and led to economic sanctions. A heightened perception of risk and the financial sanctions&#13;
imposed on Russia in late Julyall but extinguished investment. Nevertheless, the economy was&#13;
stabilized successfully. The full impact of the oil price slump and stricter sanctions, however, will be&#13;
realized this year and into 2016.&#13;

1.1 Growth - A Lost Year&#13;
In 2014 Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy barely grew at all. A steep drop in oil prices, together with uncertainty&#13;
related to geopolitical tensions and sanctions, shocked the economy, where investment was already&#13;
anemic and there were lingering structural problems. Domestic demand plummeted to rates not&#13;
seen since 2008â&#128;&#147;2009.&#13;

&amp;#12;I. Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
 Box 1 Global economic trends in 2014&#13;
  Global growth once again remained tepid in 2014. The global economy struggled to gain momentum as growth patterns&#13;
  in high-income economies increasingly diverged and in developing countries growth on average slowed. Overall, global&#13;
  growth is estimated to have averaged 2.6 percent in 2014, almost unchanged from 2012 and 2013. Growth was particularly&#13;
  disappointing in the Euro area and Japan and in emerging markets in Russia and Brazil.&#13;
  The growth of high-income countries increasingly diverged. While overall growth in high-income countries picked up&#13;
  marginally, from 1.4 percent in 2013 to an estimated 1.8 percent in 2014, there was a growing gap between countries.&#13;
  However, in the United States growth has been above potential since mid-2013 and in 2014 reached 2.4 percent, supported&#13;
  by easing fiscal consolidation, robust private investment, and a surge in consumption. In the euro area, real GDP growth&#13;
  continued to be subdued, reaching only an estimated 0.9 percent. Confidence stabilized at the end of 2014 even as the&#13;
  euro weakened and oil prices fell. In Japan, at zero percent a technical recession ended in the fourth quarter as both&#13;
  consumption and exports recovered.&#13;
  Growth in emerging and developing countries slipped. The slowdown in several large middle-income countries&#13;
  was mainly caused by cyclical factors, domestic policy tightening, and political tensions. India and Mexico grew well&#13;
  in 2014. China is undergoing a managed slowdown but growth was a still-robust 7.4 percent. In contrast to middle-&#13;
  income countries, economic activity in low-income countries picked up in 2014 as public investment rose, service sectors&#13;
  expanded significantly, and there were solid harvests and substantial capital inflows (Figure 3). For this group growth&#13;
  reached 4.4 percent in 2014, down only slightly from 4.9 percent in 2013.&#13;
  Global trade was surprisingly flaccid again, even though financing conditions were benign (Figure 4). Since the financial&#13;
  crisis began, global trade has slowed significantly, growing by less than 4 percent in 2013 and 2014â&#128;&#148;well below the pre-&#13;
  crisis average of 7 percent a year. The slowdown is due partly to a drop in demand and partly because world trade seems&#13;
  to be less sensitive to changes in global activity. Changes in global value chains and shifting composition of import demand&#13;
  may have contributed to the decline in the responsiveness of trade to growth. Benign financing conditions throughout&#13;
  much of 2014 allowed developing countries to tap international bond markets at a record pace. With major central banks&#13;
  committed to keeping their policies exceptionally accommodative to support activity, markets have tended to expect&#13;
  further accommodation when there is negative news.&#13;

Box 2 Energy price trends&#13;
    During 2014, energy markets reached a historic turning point. After having fluctuated within a tight band around US$105&#13;
    a barrel between 2011 and 2013â&#128;&#148;making it one of the least volatile three-year periods in recent historyâ&#128;&#148;in the second&#13;
    half of 2014 oil prices began to drop. They fell further on OPECâ&#128;&#153;s November decision to abandon targeting of prices. For&#13;
    2014, crude oil prices ended 2014 at below US$60 per barrel, down from an average US$104 in 2013 (Figure 6).&#13;
&#13;
    In recent years, the rapid expansion of unconventional oil production in North America was offset almost barrel for&#13;
    barrel by supply disruptions in the Middle East (Figure 6). These developments kept the global oil market fairly balanced&#13;
    and prices in the US$100-110 per barrel range. However, in the second half of 2014 some oil supply from the Middle East&#13;
    began returning to the market, while the U.S. continued its steady production of 1 million barrels per year. Previously in&#13;
    such situations Saudi Arabiaâ&#128;&#148;the producer with the highest spare capacityâ&#128;&#148;would normally lead OPEC in production cuts&#13;
    to stabilize prices. However, OPEC decided to maintain its current quota, in effect ceasing to manage the global supply in&#13;
    order to protect its market share. This decision led to the largest supply-driven correction in prices since 1986.&#13;

Box 2 How does this adjustment compare to the crisis in 2008-2009?&#13;
  In 2008 the economy fell into a deep recession in the fourth quarter while in 2014 the economy suffered a gradual&#13;
  slowdown. In 2008, the oil price dropped from US$90 per barrel in September to US$35 in December. Similarly, in 2014 they&#13;
  dropped from US$115 per barrel in July to US$57 in December. In addition to the ebb in global trade flows, in 2008â&#128;&#147;2009&#13;
  financial flows also ceased, which severely restricted access to external financing. In 2014 economic sanctions targeting&#13;
  the financial sector restricted access to external capital markets or made external borrowing essentially unaffordable. In&#13;
  both cases domestic demand, specifically consumption, sank swiftly.&#13;
&#13;
  Though the external shocks that hit the Russian economy in 2008-2009 and 2014 were similar, their impact differed. By&#13;
  the end of 2008, oil and non-oil exports had suffered much more than they did in 2014. Imports adjusted in both cases,&#13;
  but they did so earlier in 2014, even before the terms-of-trade shock, starting in quarter one due to low growth and a&#13;
  weakening ruble (Figure 8). In 2014, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ban of food imports in August helped to counterbalance the export drop and&#13;
  prevented a widening trade deficit. In 2008-2009, imports started to adjust in quarter four with the external shock.&#13;
&#13;
  Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery after 2008-2009 was swift, but its growth path in 2015-2016 is expected to be a protracted recession.&#13;
  In 2010, led by a fast revival in external demand based on an upward adjustment in oil prices, accompanied by a quick&#13;
  restoration in access to external capital markets and a sizable counter cyclical fiscal program (implemented in the second&#13;
  half of 2009), the economy exited recession. Fiscal savings over the preceding decade that accumulated in the Reserve&#13;
  Fund allowed the government to finance the fiscal deficit of 6.8 percent of GDP without a significant deterioration in its&#13;
  debt-to-GDP ratio. In 2015, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s external environment is expected to remain somewhat hostile, given low oil prices&#13;
  and export demand. As sanctions stay in place, access to external borrowing will remain restricted. Most importantly, the&#13;
  governmentâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal space for countercyclical measures is more limited because the Reserve Fund is half the size it was in&#13;
  2008-2009. Even though proposed amendments to the 2015 federal budget imply some consolidation of expenditures,&#13;
  the expected fiscal gap of 3.8 percent of GDP could severely deplete the Reserve Fund (currently equal to 4.7 percent&#13;
  of GDP). The anti-crisis plan for 2015 (Box 7) amounts to less than 2 percent of GDP and most funds are earmarked for&#13;
  recapitalization of banks.&#13;

exports to GDP growth turned negative, toâ&#128;&#147;0.6                                    also benefited from a surge in military-related&#13;

demand was disappearing, the contribution of                                     nontradable to tradable sectors, persistent&#13;
net exports to GDP went up from 0.6 percent in                                   structural rigidities and high uncertainty in 2015&#13;

because imports also contracted acutely; the                                     and capacity expansion. In 2014, as activity in&#13;
ruble had begun to depreciate at the onset of                                    nontradable sectors slowed, the tradable sector&#13;
the geopolitical tensions in the first half of 2014                              became the main growth engine. The aggregate&#13;

1.2 Labor Market â&#128;&#147; Adjustment of Wages and Incomes&#13;
Despite a continuing slowdown in the real sector, the labor market stayed tight, with unemployment&#13;
barely moving from its historically low levels as the demographics of aging continue to pressure the&#13;
labor supply. However, in the second half of 2014, as inflation accelerated real wages contracted&#13;
abruptly; if that continues, it will mean the labor market is adjusting to lower demand.&#13;

Box 4 How the labor market adjusted in previous crises&#13;
    Keeping unemployment stable by adjusting wages is a feature of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s labor market. A traditional high share of public&#13;
    employment performs the functions social security nets play elsewhere. For this reason social protection programs are&#13;
    not well-developed in Russia. In the transition period of the early 1990s, when GDP declined by about 40 percent, the&#13;
    labor markets of Russia and other former Soviet Union republics saw a relatively low increase in unemployment (up to 15&#13;
    percent) and a much higher contraction of real wages (more than 50 percent). Similarly, in 2009, although unemployment&#13;
    went up by 3 percentage points, wage growth contracted by 5 percent after growing 15 percent year-on-year before the&#13;
    crisis (Figure 13 and Figure 14). The labor market reacted similarly this time: Real wages contracted by 4 percent year-on-&#13;
    year in December and averaged 9 percent in January and February 2015. Continued wage adjustment is likely to contain&#13;
    unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
    More labor market arrangements are informal during crisis periods because: (i) relatively low unemployment benefits&#13;
    induce people to find new jobs quickly, which, given the softer labor market, are more likely to be informal; and (ii) high&#13;
    variation in salaries leaves room for employers to adjust wages in different ways. Among them are an increase in informal&#13;
    earnings (â&#128;&#156;envelope salariesâ&#128;&#157;), which allows employers to lower social insurance and other contributions. Usually, this&#13;
    tends more to characterize small enterprises and the self-employed, but during crises even medium and large enterprises&#13;
    switch in part to informal salary payments. Finally, the widespread use of migrants in some sectors of the economy,&#13;
    especially services and construction, is more easily adjusted during crises and the statistics on this are not fully captured.&#13;

shift in exchange rate policy and coordinated measures to stabilize the financial system. Significant&#13;
monetary tightening failed to anchor the inflation expectations that were generated by the weakening&#13;
ruble and Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ban on food imports.&#13;

&#13;
    Box 5 December 2014: Policy moves to enhance financial stability&#13;
     The ruble collapse in December prompted the Russian authorities to implement coordinated measures to stabilize&#13;
     the exchange rate and ensure financial stability. In addition to the new foreign exchange repo facilities introduced in&#13;
     November, the following measures were introduced:&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Finance sold foreign exchange in the amount of US$1.5 billion.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The CBR introduced 28- and 365-day foreign currency loans to the 11 banks with capital of over RUB100 billion.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Five major state-owned exporters were given a deadline of March 1, 2015, to cut their net foreign assets back to the&#13;
         level of October 1, 2014.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 On December 30, a RUB1 trillion bank recapitalization program was launched by issuing Treasury bonds.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The State Duma approved a bill allowing the government to invest up to 10 percent of the National Wealth Fund in&#13;
         subordinate deposits and subordinate bonds of Russian banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
  	 The CBR spent US$86.5 billion of foreign currency reserves in 2014, leaving it with a balance of US$390 billion (10.7 months of imports) at&#13;
    year end.&#13;
5&#13;
  	 Imports of both food and non-food items constitute about 15-20 percent of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s consumer basket items. Yet some imports (e.g.,&#13;
    meats, fruit, and vegetables) account for a significantly higher share in total consumptions. Thus how the ban affected inflation differed&#13;
    for food items.&#13;

    Box 6 Migration and remittance trends&#13;
     Russia is the second largest host of immigrants worldwide. In 2013, nearly half of the 11 million immigrants in Russia&#13;
     came from Ukraine (2.9 million) and Kazakhstan (2.5 million). Other major countries of origin were Azerbaijan (0.7 million),&#13;
     Belarus (0.7 million), the Kyrgyz Republic (0.6 million), Armenia (0.5 million), Tajikistan (0.5 million), and Georgia (0.4&#13;
     million) (Figure 22). Of the 10.8 million Russians living abroad, most were in Ukraine (3.5 million) and Kazakhstan (2.4&#13;
     million), followed by Germany (1 million), Belarus (0.7 million), Uzbekistan (0.6 million), and the U.S.(0.4 million) (Figure&#13;
     23). After the U.S. (46 million), Russia hosts the second largest number of migrants worldwide (11 million), followed by&#13;
     Germany (10 million) and Saudi Arabia (9 million). However, this number fell from 11.9 million in 2000 to 11.0 million in&#13;
     2013; the number of Russians living abroad held steady at about 10.8 million.&#13;

  	 Net capital outflows had several components: private firms and banks increasing their net asset positions abroad, net purchases of foreign&#13;
    currency by private companies and households, and FDI. In addition, the restricted access to capital markets resulted in firms and banks&#13;
    deleveraging their external debt, paying it rather than rolling it over. FDI flows are a small part of capital outflows and include in part&#13;
    repatriated offshore money from Russian firms.&#13;

     Outward remittances in 2014 were impacted by the ruble depreciation. Of a total of US$20.2 billion remittances from&#13;
     Russia, more than 88 percent went to: Uzbekistan (US$5.6 billion), Tajikistan (US$3.7 billion), Ukraine (US$2.2 billion),&#13;
     Kyrgyzstan (US$1.9 billion), and Armenia (US$1.2 billion) (Figure 24). Remittances to these countries have been going&#13;
     up steadily since 2009 and most noticeably in 2009-13. However, in 2014, the currency depreciation meant that the&#13;
     value of remittances to these countries was 14 percent less than in 2013. The cost for sending remittances from&#13;
     Russia (2.4 percent) is the lowest among all G20 countriesâ&#128;&#148;only a third of the G20 average (8.1 percent).1 Remittance&#13;
     inflows into Russia (US$4.2 billion) are about a fifth of outflows. Some 43 percent of all remittance inflows come from&#13;
     three countries: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan (US$0.6 billion each) (Figure 25). Inflows to Russia have been&#13;
     growing in recent years.&#13;

&#13;
 Box 7          The government anti-crisis plan&#13;
      On January 27, 2014, the government adopted an anti-crisis plan with the goal to ensure sustainable economic&#13;
      development and social stability in an unfavorable global economic and political environment. It announced that in&#13;
      2015â&#128;&#147;2016 it will take steps to advance structural changes in the Russian economy, provide support to systemic entities&#13;
      and the labor market, lower inflation, and help vulnerable households adjust to price increases. To achieve the objectives of&#13;
      positive growth and sustainable medium-term macroeconomic development the following measures are planned:&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Provide support for import substitution and non-mineral exports;&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Support small and medium enterprises by lowering financing and administrative costs;&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Create opportunities for raising financial resources at reasonable cost in key economic sectors;&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Compensate vulnerable households (e.g., pensioners) for the costs of inflation;&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Cushion the impact on the labor market (e.g. provide training and increase public works);&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Optimize budget expenditures; and&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Enhance banking sector stability and create a mechanism for reorganizing systemic companies.&#13;
&#13;
      The government aims to achieve a balanced budget in the medium term and intends to cut budget expenditures by&#13;
      5 percent in real terms in the next three years. In 2015, the plan is to cut 10 percent of spending across all categories&#13;
      except military, agriculture, and external debt-servicing. The Ministry of Finance currently plans to use the Reserve Fund to&#13;
      optimize federal budget spending. It is expected that about RUB1.4 trillion of the anti-crisis plan will be financed this year,&#13;
      of which up to RUB972 billion will be financed from the federal budget and RUB550 billion with the NWF.&#13;
&#13;
      It is estimated that the plan will cost RUB2.4 trillion, of which 67 percent is earmarked for bank recapitalization, which&#13;
      will operate through three channels: (i) Treasury bonds worth RUB1 trillion had already been transferred to the Deposit&#13;
      Insurance Agency in December 2014. In February the government approved a list of 27 banks eligible for recapitalization.&#13;
      Banks to be recapitalized are expected to increase mortgage loans, loans to small and medium enterprises, and loans to&#13;
      key economy sectors by 1 percent a month and increase their own capital by at least half of the amount received from the&#13;
      Deposit Insurance Agency; (ii) The NWF will finance a second channel, investing RUB250 billion in subordinated deposits&#13;
      and bonds of the systemic banks that have capital of RUB100 billion (US$1.6 billion). The interest rate should at least cover&#13;
      the CPI inflation rate. On October 1, 2014, nine banks met the criteria. Banks that receive these deposits are expected to&#13;
      finance government-approved investment projects; and (iii) Another RUB300 billion will be channeled through the NWF to&#13;
      Vnesheconom bank to provide credit to the real sector.&#13;
&#13;
      About 13.9 percent of the anti-crisis plan (RUB320 billion) will go to direct support of the real sector: RUB200 billion in&#13;
      state guarantees for systemic companies, RUB50 billion for support of agricultural enterprises, and RUB10 billion for the&#13;
      transport utilization program. The government has approved a list of 199 systemic enterprises eligible for state guarantees,&#13;
      among them all major Russian companies. Companies on the list produce 70 percent of GDP of Russia. These steps mainly&#13;
      address the development of sustainable enterprises given lower domestic demand, an unfavorable global environment,&#13;
      and high credit costs. Some administrative measures are expected to smooth state procurement, which was hit by the&#13;
      exchange rate crisis.&#13;
&#13;
      Another 12.9 percent (RUB296 billion) is earmarked for social support, including pension indexation higher than the&#13;
      federal budget law envisaged, RUB52.2 billion for easing the labor market, RUB30 billion for payments for registered&#13;
      unemployed, and RUB16 billion for additional medical support.&#13;
&#13;
      About 7.0 percent (RUB160 billion) will be transferred to the regions through budget loans.&#13;

Economic Outlook&#13;
R   ussiaâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term growth prospects are threatened by the recent slide in oil prices and the&#13;
    continued impact of sanctions. The World Bank growth outlook for Russia projects that in 2015&#13;
these two shocks will push the economy into recession. The baseline scenario sees contractions over&#13;
the next two years of 3.8 percent in 2015 and 0.3 percent in 2016. There are upside and downside&#13;
risks to the oil price projections as the global oil market continues searching for a new equilibrium&#13;
price. To account for this risk, the World Bank Russia outlook has two alternative scenarios for Russia&#13;
straddling the baseline scenario, one reflecting an upper-bound oil price and the second a lower-&#13;
bound price. In the medium term, the economy will need to adjust to both the new oil prices and&#13;
continued uncertainty related to geopolitical tensions and sanctions. Both new realities have the&#13;
potential to alter the structure of the Russian economy and the ways Russia integrates with the rest&#13;
of the world.&#13;

2.1 Outlook for Russia â&#128;&#147; Protracted Recession&#13;
The World Bank has set out three scenarios: the baseline, an upper-bound oil price scenario and&#13;
a lower-bound oil price scenario. The baseline projects recession, given the most likely oil price&#13;
prospects and the assumption that economic sanctions will be in effect throughout 2015 and 2016.&#13;

&#13;
 Box 8 Oil price outlook&#13;
  With supplies surging and demand diminishing, oil inventories have been building up. OECD stocks recovered to about&#13;
  2.7 billion barrels at yearend 2014 and now exceed their 5-year average. The build-up in stocks was nearly continuous&#13;
  after they reached 9-year lows in 2013. Inversely, OPECâ&#128;&#153;s spare production capacity eased back to 3.7 million barrels per&#13;
  day in the fourth quarter of 2014 on increased output, after peaking at almost 5 million barrels per day at the end of 2013&#13;
  (Figure 30).&#13;
&#13;
  The World Bank projects that oil prices will average US$53 per barrel in 2015, 45 percent less than in 2014. It is assumed&#13;
  that OPEC will abstain from any form of supply management and that there will be no deterioration in the global economic&#13;
  environment. This forecast reflects the shift in OPEC policy, easing of geopolitical tensions, ample supplies, and moderating&#13;
  demand (Figure 31). The production capacity already in place suggests that low prices will continue for some time, with&#13;
  prices expected to recover only modestly, by US$4 a barrel, in 2016. The weakness in crude oil prices will extend to&#13;
  other energy markets, especially European and Asian markets for natural gas. In 2015 prices for European natural gas are&#13;
  expected to decline by 15 percent.&#13;

the debt payment profile is easier than it was                          16.5 percent in 2015 (Table 7). With the ruble&#13;

 Box 9 Global outlook&#13;
  Global growth is expected to rise moderately in 2015 (Table 8). At present, recovery is relying heavily on robust growth in&#13;
  the U.S.: above-trend growth (with job creation)is expected to carry over into 2015 and to outpace global growth for the&#13;
  first time since 1999. In the Euro area, conditions are in place for improvement in the first quarter of 2015 despite rising&#13;
  uncertainty about the Greek bailout plan and unresolved tensions related to Russia. High-income countries are likely to&#13;
  see growth slightly up from the 1.7 percent posted in 2014 as labor markets gradually recover, fiscal consolidation ebbs,&#13;
  and financing costs stay low. Meanwhile, activity indicators in China continue to signal a gradual deceleration. As the&#13;
  domestic headwinds that held back growth in developing countries in 2014 abate and recovery in high-income countries&#13;
  slowly firms up, growth is projected to gradually accelerate.&#13;

  Global activity over the medium term should be supported by declining oil prices, but the positive effect will be offset&#13;
  in 2015 by tough adjustments in oil-exporting economies (e.g., Russia and Venezuela) and persistent headwinds&#13;
  among larger net importers, such as the Euro area and Japan. Overall, lower oil prices mean that prospects for oil-&#13;
  exporting and oil-importing countries will diverge. Empirical estimates suggest that growth in some oil-exporting countries&#13;
  could contract by 0.8â&#128;&#147;2.5 percentage points in the year after a 10 percent decline in the annual average oil price. The&#13;
  slowdown would compound revenue losses in these countries as fiscal break-even prices exceed current oil prices for&#13;
  most oil exporters. However, such fiscal pressures can partly be mitigated by sovereign wealth funds or reserves. In Brazil,&#13;
  Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey, falling oil prices will help suppress inflation and reduce current account deficitsâ&#128;&#148;a&#13;
  major source of vulnerability for many emerging economies. Growth in low-income countries is expected to stay strong,&#13;
  but the moderation in oil and other commodity prices will hold back growth in those low-income countries that export&#13;
  commodities.&#13;

 Box 10 The 2015-2017 budget projections&#13;
     The amendments to the budget law apply to 2015, with the Ministry of Finance planning to introduce changes related&#13;
     to 2016 and 2017 by September 2015. This temporary lack of medium- term perspective leaves all budget entities deeply&#13;
     uncertain. It is however, similar to what happened during the 2008â&#128;&#147;2009 crisis when there was no medium-term budget&#13;
     projection in 2009. The new macroeconomic assumptions for the 2015 amendments to the federal budget law project an&#13;
     average oil price of US$50 per barrel (down from US$100 per barrel) and a GDP contraction of 3.0 percent.&#13;
&#13;
     In 2015, federal budget revenue is projected to decrease by 3.3 percent of GDP (13.5 percent in nominal terms) with&#13;
     oil and gas revenues falling by 12.1 percentage points (2.7 percent of GDP). The oil price used to calculate the oil&#13;
     extraction tax and customs duties, has a tax-exempted part (US$25 per barrel), and with oil prices low its share becomes&#13;
     proportionally higher. As for non-oil revenues, VAT is projected to decrease most, due to shrinking domestic demand and&#13;
     the REER depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
     Federal budget expenditures will decrease marginally, from 20.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.8 percent in 2015. The&#13;
     main challenges for the spending side are the weaker ruble and high inflation, which put upward pressure on expenditures&#13;
     through indexed social payments and the cost of procuring imported goods. In 2015, government priorities favored social&#13;
     policy and national defense. In 2015, social policy expenditures will increase by 0.9 percent of GDP (a nominal 22.1 percent&#13;
     increase) with the majority of the increase devoted to pensions and social provisioning of households. National defense&#13;
     spending will increase by 0.7 percent of GDP (a nominal 25.7 percent increase) compared to 2014 as the government&#13;
     adheres to its long-term program of modernizing the army. Spending on the national economy is planned to decrease by&#13;
     1.4 percent of GDP. Intergovernmental transfers will decrease by 0.3 percent of GDP, but this will be partly compensated&#13;
     by budget loans to the regions in the amount of RUB160 billion (0.2 percent of GDP). Expenditures for health will decrease&#13;
     by 0.2 percent of GDP and for education 0.1 percent.&#13;
&#13;
     The federal budget projects a deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to a 0.5 percent deficit in 2014. The&#13;
     primary budget deficit will increase to 2.9 percent of GDP from the surplus of 0.1 percent in 2014. The non-oil deficit will&#13;
     reach 11.5 percent of GDP compared to the 10.9 deficit in 2014. With access to international financial markets restricted&#13;
     and credit costs high, the Reserve Fund will be the main source for deficit financing. By the end of the year, it is projected&#13;
     to decrease from RUB3.1 billion to RUB2.6 billion. The amendments suggest that an additional RUB 500 billion could be&#13;
     used for deficit financing in 2015â&#128;&#148;a possible downside risk. The anti-crisis plan will have limited effect on federal budget&#13;

2.2 Risks to the Growth Outlook&#13;
Risks to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s external environment, the global outlook, and especially oil price trends are&#13;
prominent. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term growth outlook will also depend on how Russia will master the&#13;
adjustment to the oil price and the sanctions shocks, taking into account the risks to financial stability&#13;
and fiscal sustainability.&#13;

R   isks to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth outlook stem partly&#13;

into prolonged stagnation or deflation, global                        necessary to reassess risk.&#13;
trade could decline even more. Although&#13;
this is a low-probability event given Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s                         There are significant risks to the global energy&#13;
substantial policy buffers, a worse decline in its                    price forecast. On the supply side, while the&#13;
growth could trigger a disorderly unwinding of                        costs of extracting unconventional oil may be&#13;

let markets determine the price rather than             of fiscal buffers would ensure continued fiscal&#13;
engaging in supply management. Before that              sustainability at all administrative levels. The&#13;
decision, Saudi Arabiaâ&#128;&#148;OPECâ&#128;&#153;s largest and               vulnerability of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s financial sector has&#13;
most influential memberâ&#128;&#148;had offered a series            heightened. Government and central bank&#13;
of discounts to Asian oil importers, signaling          measures are providing some relief to banks but&#13;
its intention to abandon price targeting. Since         could also be pushing up systemic risks. Parts of&#13;
November OPEC officials have repeatedly stated          the January government anti-crisis plan relate&#13;
that the cartel will not act even if prices fall to     to measures to support financial stability (Box&#13;

A second set of risks relates to how successfully       of those assets. Deteriorating asset values will&#13;
Russia will manage adjustments to the oil price         require injections of capital (which may not&#13;
and sanctions shocks. Specifically, sanctions are       be possible) and will thus make banks more&#13;
likely to linger for longer and could well alter the    vulnerable to funding shortfalls and possible&#13;
structure of the Russian economy and how Russia         deposit runs. Thus, the financial condition of&#13;
integrates with the rest of the world. A notable        banks, especially smaller ones that are not&#13;
shift is its reorientation to new trade partners and    considered systemically important, is likely to&#13;
to markets other than Europe and the West. This         worsen during 2015. Liquidity support from the&#13;
includes efforts at closer integration with former      central bank is likely to rise, and the collateral&#13;
Soviet Union republics, East Asia, and Latin            requirements for CBR loans could expose the&#13;
America. It also appears that Russia is already         declining market value of assets on bank balance&#13;

domestic industries and a footprint of the state&#13;
in the economy that is once again growing.              The financial authorities need to continue&#13;
Despite the path to more selective integration          earmarking financial resources to support&#13;
into the world economy, Russia will continue to         Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s systemically important banks and&#13;

2.3 Risks to the Poverty and Shared Prosperity Outlook&#13;
Given the growth outlook, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s achievements in the last decade with regard to poverty reduction&#13;
and the upward mobility of a large part of the population might be under threat. The first significant&#13;
increase in the poverty rate since the 1998-1999 crises is expected, since Russia has limited fiscal&#13;
space to protect the most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I n the past decade, Russia has witnessed&#13;
  unprecedented growth in household welfare,&#13;
which has lifted many out of poverty and&#13;
                                                     Russia became a middle-income society where&#13;
                                                     growth was driven by consumer demand. By&#13;
                                                     2010, the middle class controlled 74 percent&#13;
allowed many others to join the ranks of             of total household income and 86 percent of&#13;
a growing middle class. The poverty rateâ&#128;&#148;            total household consumption. When it came to&#13;
the share of the population with per capita          private consumption, in fact, the middle class&#13;
consumption equal to or below US$5/dayâ&#128;&#148;fell          became the only game in town. Positive and&#13;
from 40 percent in 2001 to 10 percent in 2010. At    sustained economic growth for most of the&#13;
the same time, the middle classâ&#128;&#148;those with per       period translated into notable growth in per&#13;

remaining fourth was explained by changes in                              (equivalent to 20.5 million). This would be the&#13;
the distribution of income. In contrast, growth in                        first significant increase in the poverty rate since&#13;
average income levels accounted for only half of                          the 1998-1999 crises: poverty did not grow in&#13;
the movements into the middle class; the other                            2008-2009 because there was some growth in&#13;

S   ince the start of the geopolitical tensions, Russia has been subject to several rounds of sanctions&#13;
    by developed economies. First, sanctions directed at specific individuals, groups, and companies&#13;
imposed restrictions on travel and business operations and froze their assets. Later, sanctions aimed&#13;
at Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s military, energy, and financial sectors followed. In August, Russia introduced counter&#13;
sanctions, banning food imports from sender countries. Sanctions and counter sanctions hit the&#13;
economy through three channels: (i) Massive capital outflows made the foreign exchange market&#13;
more volatile and caused a significant depreciation of the ruble; (ii) Financial sanctions restricted&#13;
access to international financial markets for some Russian banks and firms and made external&#13;
borrowing very expensive for others; and (iii) The already low confidence of domestic businesses and&#13;
consumers in future growth prospects diminished further, reducing consumption and investment.&#13;
Sanctions also started to impact trade flows. International experience shows that sanctions are likely&#13;
to last for long periods.&#13;

                                                                      In addition to these methodologies, industrial&#13;
                                                                      surveys have been conducted to capture the&#13;
                                                                      indirect costs, which are notoriously hard to&#13;
situations and game theory (Box 11). Many of                          quantify. Hufbauer (1990) and the EABC (1997)&#13;
the evaluation exercises measured direct costs                        looked at indirect costs typically incurred by the&#13;
incurred, such as losses in export sales and                          sender of a sanction, such as loss of reliability&#13;
market shares, job losses, compliance costs,                          as a supplier, loss of opportunities for forming&#13;
and losses incurred by suppliers of inputs to&#13;
                                                                      critical business relationships or participating&#13;

been identified. The methodologies applied&#13;
evaluate the impact of sanctions by measuring                         because of loss of market share. For example, in&#13;

&amp;#12;III. The Economic Impact of Sanctions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 11 Methodologies of economic sanctions evaluation&#13;
  The statistical approach used in evaluating the impact of economic sanctions include gravity, partial equilibrium, and&#13;
  general equilibrium models. The gravity model of bilateral trade flows assesses bilateral trade patterns and what drives&#13;
  them. The basic gravity equation1 is often augmented with a sanctions variable to quantify the impact of sanctions on&#13;
  trade patterns (e.g., Hufbauer et al., 1997; Askariet et al., 2003; International Economics Policy Brief, 2003). The partial&#13;
  equilibrium model makes it possible to examine the welfare impacts of economic sanctions on the markets involved; the&#13;
  general equilibrium model links restricted markets and sectors to all other markets in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
  Richardson (1993)2 pioneered sanctions evaluation using the partial equilibrium model. The model considers demand&#13;
  and supply disruptions in sender and target countries due to sanctions to assess the impact of each3 sanction under varying&#13;
  degrees of imperfect competition, cost structures, and number of firms and countries. A limitation of partial equilibrium&#13;
  models in general is their inability to distinguish between sectors, which mitigates substitution or input cost effects on&#13;
  other sectors due to sanctions in one sectorâ&#128;&#148;the second-order effects on goods or sectors not targeted as a result of&#13;
  sanctions on a targeted sector. The general equilibrium model fills the interaction gap left by partial equilibrium models.&#13;
  General equilibrium modeling allows for full interactions between flows of output, income, and consumption because it&#13;
  is based on the social account matrix, which is the complete data base of sectoral flows and the aggregate of an entire&#13;
  economy for a given period. Canes (1998) used general equilibrium modeling to evaluate the implications of economic&#13;
  sanctions for energy policy and Becker et al. (1990) used it in evaluating the costs of economic sanctions on South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
  Unlike the empirical approaches, the game theory approach does not yield quantified estimates of the costs incurred by&#13;
  the countries involved. Applying game theory in the context of economic sanctions allows for qualitative analysis of their&#13;
  impact. In using the game theory approach to evaluate sanctions, the countries involved (sender and target) are treated&#13;
  as two opposed subjects where each country makes strategic policy decisions vis-Ã -vis the strategy adopted by the other.4&#13;
  Costs, especially to the sender, are attributed to an overall sanction strategy (see, e.g., Eaton and Engers 1992; Bergeijk&#13;
  1994; Bergeijk and Marrewijk 1994; Bonetti 1994; Barrett 1998; and the USITC 1998). It also considers the potential impact&#13;
  of a threat of sanctions, which can in itself negatively impact countries. Even if sanctions are not imposed, the threat can&#13;
  be an efficient strategy for the sender, one the target country could avoid by cooperating.&#13;

 Box 12 Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s food import ban&#13;
  On August 7, 2014, Russia imposed a ban on specific food commodities imported from the U.S., the EU, Canada, Australia,&#13;
  and Norway in response to the economic sanctions those countries had imposed. The banned products include beef,&#13;
  poultry, fish, sausages and other meat products, vegetables, fruits and nuts, milk and dairy products, and cheese. Russia&#13;
  also banned fresh fruits, wine, and processed meat from Moldova, and potatoes, soy beans, sunflower, and corn grits from&#13;
  Ukraine. The total value of affected trade is estimated at US$9.5 billion; the banned products account for 9.5 percent of&#13;
  total food consumption in Russia and 22.5 percent of its total food imports.&#13;
&#13;
  The ban heightened inflation pressures; prices have already risen for the targeted items, hurting Russian consumers&#13;
  but stimulating domestic food production (section 1.3). The food import ban is very broad and covers both staples and&#13;
  luxury items. Also, substitution by domestic products has increased the cost of food for the most vulnerable segments of&#13;
  the population in Russia. Russian food processing companies that rely on imported inputs that are on the banned list are&#13;
  experiencing increased costs. In an effort to control and prevent increases in food prices, the decree that introduced the&#13;
  import ban also included measures to prevent the growth of prices for related agricultural products. A list of 40 products&#13;
  (almost all goods of the approved in the Russian CPI food basket) was created by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of&#13;
  Russia, based on which the authorities monitor daily prices of traders, municipalities and regions. However, the food&#13;
  import ban created some incentive for domestic food production, which increased continuously in the past half year.&#13;
&#13;
  Some short-term and medium-term risks are connected to the food import ban. In the short term, transaction costs are&#13;
  rising as new channels to source food imports are sought. In the mediumterm, the trade ban could result in retaliation by&#13;
  trading partners, and there is a risk that WTO disputes will escalate. The EU is considering WTO dispute settlement options&#13;
  in response to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s import bans. Russia has also indicated that the U.S. (and implicitly EU) sanctions are in breach of&#13;
  WTO rules.&#13;

Massive capital outflows triggered by the                                   was consistent with the CBRâ&#128;&#153;s goals of inflation&#13;

and financial account balance and a decrease in                             domestic borrowing rates and further restricted&#13;
net international reserves (Section 1.4). The flight                        access to domestic credit for both investors and&#13;
from the ruble was compounded in the second                                 consumers.&#13;
half of 2014, when falling oil prices caused the&#13;
ruble to lose nearly half of its value against the                          The second channel through which sanctions&#13;

Despite the depreciation, non-oil exports did                               had already started when the geopolitical&#13;
not increase. Although there is an impulse for                              tensions arose. Even before the financial sector&#13;
substitution, given the persistent structural                               sanctions became effective, markets were pricing&#13;
rigidities and little spare capacity to expand                              Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s higher risk into the cost of credit, which&#13;
without further investment, its potential                                   sent sovereign CDS spreads for Russia soaring.&#13;
appears to be limited. In the short-term,                                   New foreign borrowing decreased in the first&#13;
the positive impulse for substitution might                                 half of 2014 and all but vanished in the second&#13;

measures. Even before the current geopolitical                              (Section 1.4). The tighter domestic and external&#13;
tensions started, government showed interest in                             credit conditions negatively affected investment&#13;
supporting elected firms and sectors that would                             and consumption decisions, leading to a delay or&#13;
benefit, one example being the ban on pork                                  a scaling back of some plans. In fact, after the oil&#13;

      In January 2014, Russia excluded the import of live pigs, pork, and pork products from the EU based on its phy to sanitary standards (SPS)&#13;
      policy. These products amounted in 2013 to US$1.3 billion in imports. On April 18, 2014, the EU requested consultations with the WTO&#13;
      Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) with regard to the ban on pork products. The pork product ban followed the detection of four cases of African&#13;
      swine fever in wild boar in Lithuania and Poland. However, The ban applies to live pigs, pork, and pork products from throughout the EU.&#13;
      One issue in the dispute involves localization requirements, which refer to attempts by a country or customs territory (such as the EU) to&#13;
      impose measures for control of diseased animals on part of its territoryâ&#128;&#149;such as quarantinesâ&#128;&#149;and to have the rest of the territory certified&#13;
      as disease-free. On July 22, 2014, the DSB established a panel for the dispute.&#13;

Total FDI into Russia plunged in the first three                               Some of the impact seen so far is based on early&#13;
quarters of 2014; it was 47 percent lower than                                 trade outcomes that compare quarter three&#13;
the average for the same quarters in 2011-                                     2014 and quarter three 2013: a plunge in imports&#13;
2013. The share of FDI from countries used                                     due to the already weakening exchange rate&#13;
as tax havens, such as Cyprus, Bermuda, the                                    and Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ban on food imports from Western&#13;

the first three quarters, it was mainly FDI from                               from the U.S., Japan, and Australia also dropped&#13;
non-tax havens that declined, resulting in a 59                                (Figure 39). Although the main devaluation of the&#13;

2014, the pattern of FDI from tax havens shifted                               changes entirely to the sanctions environment.&#13;

     	 FDI in Russia was in the past closely intertwined with capital outflows. Historically, investors sought to avoid adverse features of the Russian&#13;
      investment climate by relocating investments offshore and engaging in round-tripping (Fabry and Zeghini 2002), though off-shoring for tax&#13;
      reasons is also likely. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s FDI contains a large share of inbound FDI reported as originating from Cyprus and other countries, which is&#13;
      likely to be round-tripping FDI of Russian originâ&#128;&#148;in other words, repatriated capital which was previously part of capital outflows from&#13;
      Russia. After removing FDI with a reported origin in likely tax havens, the ratio of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s FDI inflows for 2007-2013 was about 1.8 percent,&#13;
      comparable to that for India and South Africa. This comparison may understate the amount of round-tripping in Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s inbound FDI since&#13;
      it may also involve other reported sources.&#13;

            Russia economic report : the dawn of a new
            economic era?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia's economy experienced two
            shocks in 2014. On top of the structural crisis that began
            in 2012, Russia had to deal with cyclical and idiosyncratic
            challenges to the economy. One of the new shocks illustrates
            Russia&#146;s integration into the world economy through its
            natural resource exports, and thus its dependence on the
            global commodity cycle: oil prices more than halved between
            July and December 2014, giving Russia a terms-of-trade
            shock. The ruble lost 46 percent of its value against the US
            dollar, which worsened already eroded business and consumer
            confidence. The monetary tightening in response made credit
            expensive, further dampening domestic demand. The other,
            more idiosyncratic, shock was related to the geopolitical
            tensions that began in March 2014 and led to economic
            sanctions. The tensions not only heightened perceptions that
            Russian investments had become riskier, they also
            dramatically increased the costs of external borrowing for
            Russian banks and firms. Spreads on Russian credit default
            swaps peaked in December at 578 basis points, compared to
            159 a year ago. Together with the financial sanctions
            imposed on Russia in late July, which have restricted the
            access of Russia&#146;s largest state-connected banks and firms
            to Western international finance markets, this all but
            extinguished investment. The current World Bank baseline
            outlook, however, sees the national poverty rate increasing
            from 10.8 percent in 2013 to 14.2 percent in 2015 and 2016.
            Poverty is expected to increase because real disposable
            income and consumption will decline. This would be the first
            significant increase in poverty rates since the 1998-1999
            crises. Russia weathered the 2008- 2009 crisis well as
            disposable incomes continued to grow slightly. Given the
            current limited fiscal space, additional support for the
            poor and vulnerable is likely to be less generous than it
            was during the 2008-2009 crisis. Although people at the
            bottom of the income distribution are the most vulnerable,
            there will be less opportunity for an increase in shared
            prosperity in 2015-2016, and there is a worrisome
            possibility that recent achievements might be reversed.
