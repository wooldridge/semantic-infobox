REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Country Background&#13;
1.1    Endowed with limited natural resources, Yemen belongs to the group of least developed&#13;
countries. Its per capita GNP in 1994 was estimated at $280'. Scant rainfall and desert conditions in&#13;
many areas severely restrict agriculture while manufacturing is still at an infant stage. The average life&#13;
expectancy is less than 50 years; fertility and mortality rates are high as is illiteracy among adults,&#13;
especially females.&#13;
1.2    The unification of Yemen in 1990 opened new opportunities for development. The border&#13;
between North and South disappeared, government controls in the South were replaced by market forces,&#13;
and liberal economic policies opened the country to foreign investors. This has led to a surge in oil&#13;
exploration and exports which together with the resumption of limited labor emigration to Arab oil&#13;
countries will provide resources for economic growth in the second half of the 1990s. The Government&#13;
is now preparing an economic reform program designed to reduce fiscal deficits, ease price controls, and&#13;
increase reliance on the private sector. With the possible revival of the economy there will be an&#13;
increasing demand for skilled labor in a variety of categories. To meet this demand a sustained effort is&#13;
needed to upgrade the quality of Yemen's labor force.&#13;
B. The Education Sector&#13;
1.3    Education and training in Yemen have grown rapidly over the past two decades. Enrollment in&#13;
primary education reached 1.8 million in 1992/93, a tenfold increase since the early 1970s. In addition,&#13;
some 70 thousand adults received literacy training that year, of whom more than 40 thousand were&#13;
women. Almost 600 thousand students attended secondary schools in 1992/93 (30% enrollment rate)&#13;
compared to 22 thousand in 1970/71, while more than 100 thousand students were registered in teacher&#13;
training institutes and the country's two universities. Enrollment in vocational training centers, on the&#13;
other hand, was only 6,000.&#13;
1.4    Virtually all boys and about 40% of girls are now receiving primary education. In urban areas&#13;
participation of girls is also high, although it still lags somewhat behind that of boys. In rural areas,&#13;
however, enrollment rates for girls are much lower than those for boys. This is partly the result of&#13;
traditional attitudes which discourage female education. It also reflects the shortage of female teachers&#13;
who are more acceptable to parents for girls' education. The under-representation of girls continues in all&#13;
other streams of education.&#13;
1.5    The rapid build-up of education facilities gives testimony to the priority assigned to this sector by&#13;
the Government. Major support also came from foreign donors who provided teachers and financed&#13;
school construction and equipment. IDA has been heavily involved in the sector: since 1974 fifteen&#13;
education projects were approved for Yemen. But the past emphasis on quantitative expansion has led to&#13;
serious quality deficiencies: inadequate teacher qualifications, overcrowded and poorly maintained school&#13;
buildings, and insufficient instruction materials causing low achievements among students and graduates.&#13;
Recent IDA projects therefore have focussed on quality improvements in basic and secondary education as&#13;
well as increasing female participation.2&#13;
1.6   In the current decade, the Government's strategy for education and training is concentrating on&#13;
meeting the basic education needs of a growing population; strengthening programs for human capital&#13;

2&#13;
formation to generate needed labor skills; improving gender equity in access to education, and training&#13;
facilities for the handicapped. Emphasis will be placed on institution building and decentralization of&#13;
management structures. While in the past, education was viewed as the sole responsibility of the public&#13;
sector, the Government now supports private sector participation in all educational streams, including&#13;
vocational and technical training.&#13;
C. Demand for Skilled Workers&#13;
1.7    Yemen is still at the early stages of economic development with the bulk of its 3.6 million labor&#13;
force working in traditional sectors (mainly agriculture) estimated to be 2.5 million. Demand for skilled&#13;
workers suitable for employment in modern industry and commerce frequently cannot be met due to the&#13;
inadequate scope and quality of existing training programs. This has led to a sizeable body of immigrant&#13;
workers (currently estimated at 20,000) with main concentration in larger firms, where they account for&#13;
about 15-20 percent of the work force.&#13;
1.8    The present employment in industrial and commercial firms is close to 50,000; another 100,000&#13;
or more workers are employed in small production and service industries (Background Table A, Annex&#13;
21). Assuming an annual attrition rate of 3 percent, there would be around 4,500 job openings a year.&#13;
In addition, new private investment projects licensed during the past two years are expected to generate as&#13;
many as 28,000 jobs within the next three to five years (Annex 2).&#13;
1.9    Private establishments dominate the industrial and commercial sectors. Only about 10 percent of&#13;
the labor force is in public enterprises (see Background Table A in Annex 21). Industrial firms are&#13;
mainly engaged in oil production and refining, in food processing, textiles and clothing, chemicals and&#13;
plastic goods, kitchen utensils and furniture, building materials and metal working. There is also a&#13;
sizeable construction industry, and a large number of small and medium sized trading companies. Other&#13;
service industries employing skilled workers include financial institutions, hotels and catering. Most of&#13;
these firms are located in Sana'a, Hodeidah, Taiz, Aden and Hadramout.&#13;
II. CURRENT STATUS AND ISSUES IN VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
A. Background and Current Status&#13;
2.1    Formal vocational training (VT) in Yemen began in the early 1970s with the establishment of&#13;
Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) offering two-year programs for graduates of basic education (9th&#13;
grade). As the needs for skilled manpower increased in the industrial, commercial, agricultural and&#13;
health sectors, additional training institutions were established by a variety of public sector agencies with&#13;
some support from donor agencies.&#13;
2.2    Out of a total of 26 VTCs, 15 offer industrial and commercial pre-employment training&#13;
(Background Table B, Annex 21). Their basic objective is to supply skilled workers for the labor market&#13;
thus strengthening one of the principal factors for successful industrial and economic development. Close&#13;
to 5,000 students are enrolled in these centers while the number of graduates has averaged about 2,100&#13;
p.a. in recent years.&#13;

Source: General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.3    Six of the 15 industrial and commercial VTCs were controlled by the Ministry of Social Security,&#13;
Social Services and Labor (MSSL), eight by the Ministry of Education (MOE), and one by the Ministry&#13;
of Construction. There are no private VTCs offering pre-employment training. Training for the&#13;
handicapped is provided at some 19 centers through NGOs, private sector, MOH, MSSL, and through&#13;
local councils for development. In-service training is provided by several public sector institutions (e.g.,&#13;
Electricity Corporation, Ministry of Information, General Authority for Civil Aviation, National&#13;
Cigarettes and Matches Company) and enterprise-based training is provided by four large private sector&#13;
companies (Hayel Saeed Group of Companies, Thabet Brothers, Al-Thawarah Industrial Complex -- a&#13;
group of twenty small companies, and Yemen Hunt Oil Company) to train their own employees.&#13;
2.4    The control of VTCs by different ministries has led to a fragmentation of Yemen's VTS which is&#13;
marked by uneven course structures and regional distribution as well as the absence of a cohesive national&#13;
strategy for vocational training. The result has been limited access to training and neglect of female&#13;
participation, poor quality and relevance of training programs, and weak management structures, all of&#13;
which have reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. More recently, budgetary constraints&#13;
have created severe financial problems for the VTCs which still depend exclusively on government&#13;
support for their operations.&#13;
B. Maior Issues&#13;
2.5    The present VTS is facing four major issues: sector management, financial sustainability of VT&#13;
operations, quality and relevance, and access and equity. Turning to the first issue of sector&#13;
management, pre-employment training is the responsibility of the Government while in-service training is&#13;
organized by private or public enterprises. This is a model that has proven to be viable in many&#13;
countries, both developing and industrialized ones; the model is especially relevant to Yemen's existing&#13;
state of development, where private training capacity is weak. Overall policy coordination of pre-&#13;
employment training was initially a function of the MOE in the northern part of the country and MOL in&#13;
the south of the country. After the unification of Yemen in 1990, the newly established Ministry of&#13;
Labor and Vocational Training (later changed to Ministry of Social Security, Social Services and Labor)&#13;
became responsible for sector policy and management. Within the Ministry, the General Authority for&#13;
Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT) serves as executive agency for supervising the VTCs.&#13;
2.6    While administrative responsibilities have thus been delineated, actual communication between the&#13;
MSSL and other public agencies involved in VT remains weak. The Ministry has yet to develop a&#13;
cohesive strategy and supporting policy framework acceptable to the principal constituents and&#13;
beneficiaries of the VTS. To improve the present management structure, the Government realizes that&#13;
stronger linkages are needed with employers and communities at the national and local levels; national&#13;
training norms will have to be introduced; and individual VTCs will require greater autonomy and active&#13;
participation of the private sector in managing their affairs and developing programs attuned to the needs&#13;
of local labor markets. In-service training by employers and private training providers also need&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
2.7    Financing of Vocational Training. VT consumes about one percent of government spending on&#13;
education. It is very limited and can only support a minimum of operating expenses.3 While students are&#13;
subsidized through small stipends and support for boarding and meals, there is no cost recovery through&#13;
student fees. External assistance is provided by foreign donors (especially, a decade-long assistance from&#13;
Germany, and more recently assistance from the Netherlands and OPEC Fund) who contribute equipment&#13;
and technical assistance. But this does not meet the investment requirements of the VTS, consequently&#13;
alternative sources of financing through beneficiary participation (employers and students) would be&#13;
essential. Even with the anticipated involvement of private sector in VT, a certain amount of government&#13;
support would be justified over the longer term for the following reasons: (a) most students are poor and&#13;
3/    In 1995. total recurrent expenditure for the 15 VTCs included: YR40 million for salaries, YR20 million for student&#13;
subsidies, and YRIO million for overheads, supplies, maintenance and instructional resources -- Mission estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
cannot even afford to bear the partial costs of their training; (b) special support is needed to achieve&#13;
equity-oriented objectives such as training of females, handicapped and marginal population groups; and&#13;
(c) VT contributes to the competitiveness of the national economy.&#13;
2.8    The low level of funding has been a major factor responsible for the limited access to pre-&#13;
employment training and its quality deficiencies such as shortage of instruction materials, poorly&#13;
maintained equipment and facilities, and inadequate teacher training. In addition, the small size of the&#13;
private sector has resulted in limited development of enterprise-based training (only in four companies)&#13;
and complete absence of apprenticeship training. To overcome the financial constraints and to develop an&#13;
adequate and sustainable resource base for the training of skilled workers, the financial base of the VTS&#13;
needs to be broadened and its access to resources diversified. This requires a greater participation of&#13;
employers who would benefit from the training of the domestic labor force. Such changes in policy&#13;
would help to strengthen the financial viability of the VTS and gradually ensure that the burden of&#13;
support for vocational training would be shared by government and the main beneficiaries (employers) of&#13;
VTCs, and more specifically provide incentives for private sector to provide such training.&#13;
2.9    The issues of quality and relevance of present training programs are reviewed in Annex 3 which&#13;
highlights weaknesses in curricula, teacher qualification, trainee assessment and supplies of instruction&#13;
materials and equipment. The annex also reviews present shortcomings in access and gender equity,&#13;
including training for the handicapped.&#13;
C. Adult Education and Training&#13;
2.10   Adult education and training (AET) is usually associated with literacy training and covers both&#13;
rural and urban areas. Courses for women focus on income generating skills such as sewing and&#13;
handicrafts, crop management and animal husbandry, home economics and health education. Adult&#13;
education programs have had enormous appeal for adolescent girls and women, and are popular in spite&#13;
of extremely poor conditions at most centers as they provide an important outlet for young girls and&#13;
women not only in terms of enhancing their ability to enter into income generating activities but more&#13;
importantly, to become literate.&#13;
2.11   Adult education and training centers face similar issues and constraints as the formal VTS (Annex&#13;
4). AET centers operate as welfare activities rather than as educational and skills development facilities.&#13;
No standards are applied, teachers are paid only a "token allowance" and not a salary, and centers run on&#13;
shoestring budgets. As low priority activities, many centers have received no operational expenses&#13;
allocations for the last few years. Consequently, the quality of programs has deteriorated considerably.&#13;
There is a high turnover of teaching staff and retraining is often inadequate. Overcoming the problems&#13;
requires Government as well as community commitment to provide systematic support to the centers to&#13;
make them more responsive to local conditions and markets through changes in the organizational&#13;
structure of adult education and training, more decentralization and community involvement; and&#13;
diversification of financial resources to achieve long-term sustainability of training programs.&#13;
D. IDA Strategy and Lending Experience&#13;
2.12   IDA's lending strategy in Yemen has supported government plans to establish a modern education&#13;
and training system, and has been closely associated with the development of appropriate sector policies.&#13;
Educational objectives and strategies were reviewed in a study on human development4 and the findings&#13;
were discussed with the Government in February 1992. As a result of this review, IDA's assistance&#13;
strategy is focussing on helping the Yemeni Government to: (a) improve learning achievements in primary&#13;
and secondary schools, and increase access for girls; (b) develop more effective VT programs to upgrade&#13;
the skill profile of the labor force; and (c) make higher education more responsive to labor market needs.&#13;

9765 SR, Population and Human Resources Division, Country Department II, Middle East and North Africa Region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This strategy is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy which supports human resources&#13;
development, and recognized the need for skilled manpower development.&#13;
2.13   Over the past two decades, IDA has supported 15 education projects in Yemen, including four&#13;
projects in the former Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen, with a total financial commitment of about&#13;
US$183 million. Ten projects have been completed while the others are at various stages of&#13;
implementation. The earlier projects focussed on primary and secondary teacher training, adult education&#13;
programs, capacity development in the MOE, and other aspects related to the quantitative expansion&#13;
experienced throughout the 1970s and 1980s. IDA support contributed to sectoral improvements: adult&#13;
literacy rose from 27% in 1973 to 39% in 1990, with marked increase in female literacy from about 8%&#13;
to about 26%; during the period 1970-91, percentage of age cohort enrolled in primary school improved&#13;
from 22 to 76 with female enrollments increasing from 7 to 37; and the number of expatriate teachers in&#13;
the school system reduced from 80% in 1980 to some 10% in 1993.5 More recently, attention has been&#13;
shifted to gender equity, quality enhancement and training of skilled manpower. Nine of the ten&#13;
completed projects have achieved most of their stated objectives. However, delays in project&#13;
implementation began in 1989, slowing disbursements. The delays were caused mainly by political&#13;
tensions following the unification of Yemen in 1990, and by unrealistic exchange rates which made&#13;
implementation of civil works contracts difficult. New payment procedures for local civil works contracts&#13;
to offset price escalation during construction have been established. This change is showing&#13;
improvements in disbursements for ongoing projects.&#13;
2.14   Lessons from past projects have been considered in designing the proposed project. In particular,&#13;
government commitment will be obtained for appropriate levels of technical assistance. Specific lessons&#13;
from the Technical Training Project (1985) include: (a) the need to develop a sector policy; (b) the need&#13;
for increased role of private sector in skilled manpower development; and (c) the need for establishing&#13;
adequate project implementation arrangements for civil works during project preparation.&#13;
2.15   Remedial actions set out during the May 1995 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) are&#13;
expected to have a positive impact on the implementation of the proposed project. Specifically, (a) civil&#13;
works contracts will be denominated in US dollars or other stable convertible foreign currencies and the&#13;
payment of government will be carried out using the parallel exchange rate of 28 days before bid opening&#13;
(para. 4.11); (b) constraints to project implementation will be eased by the hiring of one or two experts in&#13;
project management to overcome the limited technical capacity of the responsible Project Implementation&#13;
Units (para. 4.17); and (c) revision of thresholds for procurement review at various levels -- project&#13;
directors US$0.2 million, sector ministries US$1.0 million, High Tender Board US$3.0 million.&#13;
2.16  In late 1993, the Government requested IDA assistance for a major overhaul of the country's&#13;
vocational training system. The proposed project responds to this request. It would address major&#13;
institutional and policy issues at the national and local levels, establishing a governance structure with&#13;
strong private sector representation which will be able to deliver programs attuned to the demand of local&#13;
labor market. Emphasis would be given to improving the quality and relevance of training, and to&#13;
increasing the number of female students. Private employers would share the costs of vocational training&#13;
thus reducing dependence on government funding. Strong donor collaboration and IDA's leadership are&#13;
necessary to implement such a comprehensive reform program. In particular, IDA's proposed policy&#13;
changes have been extensively discussed during donor coordination meetings chaired by the German team&#13;
leader for VT, and as a result would not be in conflict with activities of other donors who are actively&#13;
involved in the training sector. Moreover, coordination with German assisted interventions through a&#13;
complement of specialists would be ensured and is considered to be a factor to mitigate risks in&#13;
implementing the proposed project (para 5.2).&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1   The proposed project would help strengthen Yemen's capacity to train skilled labor in line with&#13;
current and emerging demand in the economy. The project has three objectives: (a) strengthening VTS&#13;
management by providing a major role to the private sector in policy-making, management and financing&#13;
of the VT system; (b) improving the quality and relevance of VT through the enhancement of programs in&#13;
existing centers and selective expansion of two pilot centers; and (c) reorientation, through participation&#13;
of communities, of adult education and training programs for women to improve their relevance. Major&#13;
characteristics of project strategies are given in Annex 5.&#13;
B. Policy Framework&#13;
3.2   Changing the policy framework under which the VTS operates would be a prerequisite to achieve&#13;
the above mentioned objectives. This involves a new governance structure and financing system, the&#13;
basic features of which are spelled out in the attached Sector Policy Statement (Annex 1 and assurances&#13;
during negotiations para. 6.1(a)). More specifically, the proposed framework provides that overall sector&#13;
policy and management would become the responsibility of a National Council for Vocational Training&#13;
(NCVT), with operational support provided by GAVTT. The project would support only those centers&#13;
willing to implement policies formulated by NCVT and monitored by GAVTT (assurances during&#13;
negotiations para. 6.1(b)). Individual VTCs would be given more autonomy and flexibility to develop&#13;
training programs responsive to the needs of local and regional labor markets. The Centers would be&#13;
supported and managed by Local Councils for Vocational Training (LCVTs), and receive guidance on&#13;
specific training needs from Local Training Program Advisory Committees (LTPACs). During&#13;
negotiations the Government provided the decree-laws establishing the NCVT, LCVTs and LTPACs, and&#13;
for the reorientation of GAVTT. Details of the proposed governance structure are outlined in Annex 6.&#13;
3.3   Role of the Private Sector. The new policy framework would give employers, especially the&#13;
private sector, a leading role in the management and financing of vocational training. Private employers&#13;
would have majority representation in all institutions dealing with VT i.e., the NCVT, LCVTs, LTPACs&#13;
and the SDF. This would help ensure that sector policies will be responsive to the needs of employers,&#13;
and that pre-employment training in VTCs will produce skills that are in demand. Strong private sector&#13;
involvement and the commitment of private funds should also provide incentives to manage the VTS&#13;
effectively and efficiently.&#13;
3.4   Financing of Vocational Training. Additional resources for both pre-employment and in-service&#13;
training, would be mobilized through a Skill Development Fund (SDF) financed largely with contributions&#13;
from participating employers (Annex 7). This would strengthen the long-term viability of the VTS and&#13;
provide resources for different types of enterprise-based training, including apprenticeship and cooperative&#13;
programs. During negotiations the Government provided the decree-law establishing the Skill&#13;
Development Fund (SDF). The SDF would start operations in 1996. It would draw its resources from a&#13;
work permit fee charged to expatriates, and a training levy amounting to one percent of the payroll paid&#13;
by participating industrial and commercial firms with more than ten employees. These arrangements&#13;
would yield an estimated YR150 million per annum at the time of project completion (2003) as against&#13;
the current government budget of YR70 million for VTCs. The SDF would support pre-employment&#13;
training in VTCs as well as in-service training by enterprises. As transfers to VTCs would be limited to&#13;
30 percent of the salary support received from the government (which in itself would be declining over&#13;
time), the bulk of the Fund's resources (some 85 to 90 percent in the year 2000) would go to enterprise&#13;
training and independent private training providers (Annex 7). Since participating firms could draw on&#13;
the Fund only for training purposes, the existence of such resources would provide a powerful incentive&#13;
to develop suitable training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.5    Transfers from the SDF would strengthen the financial base of VTCs. Additional resources&#13;
would come through retention of income from sudent fees, income generating activities, and voluntary&#13;
contributions from the private sector (assurances during negotiations para. 6.1(c)). All contributions from&#13;
the private sector to either VTCs or to SDF would be tax exempt for which assurances have been&#13;
obtained from the government (see Annex 7). This would allow the Centers to adequately cover expenses&#13;
for training materials, maintenance of key equipment, or short-term employment of specialized instructors&#13;
from industry and business thus improving the efficiency of VT programs. Annex 8 illustrates the&#13;
changing pattern in financing vocational training that could be expected for the years 1996-2003 -- SDF&#13;
contributions to VTCs would be according to agreed criteria (Annex 7 paras. 6.1 to 6.6) and would be&#13;
reduced from 50% in 1996 to about 10% by the year 2003 (Annex 8), as the fund expands (assurances&#13;
during negotiations para. 6.1(d)).&#13;
C. Proiect Comuonents6&#13;
Management and Financing of VT (US$2.7m)&#13;
3.6    Governance Structure (US$1.3 m). To establish this structure the project would provide technical&#13;
assistance (TA) to GAVTT in establishing a system for sector planning, policy-making, and organization&#13;
development, to streamline GAVTT structure into six divisions according to functions (guidance and&#13;
training, technical affairs, testing, planning and research, media and services, and finance and&#13;
administration). Consultants would also be used to develop the management capability of VTC Directors&#13;
and senior staff through national training programs. The scope of the management information system&#13;
being established in collaboration with German assistance would be enlarged and VTC-based management&#13;
information systems would be established; these would also provide input for the GAVTT-based MIS.&#13;
Necessary computers, software and training materials would be provided through the project for this&#13;
purpose. The project would also support establishment of a new Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in&#13;
GAVTT (US$0.5 m).&#13;
3.7   Skill Development Fund (US$1.9 m). To support operating expenses for the SDF the project&#13;
would provide US$1.6 million, to be disbursed against categories as specified in para. 4.11. The project&#13;
would also support specialist services and training to the staff responsible for operating the Fund, and&#13;
equipment, furniture, and necessary software to make the Fund operational. In CY96 the Government&#13;
would contribute YR1O million to jumpstart the SDF. Meanwhile, the Government has appointed a&#13;
prominent businessman to be Interim Chairman to facilitate establishment of the SDF.&#13;
Quality Improvement (US$42.3 m)&#13;
3.8    To improve the quality and relevance of pre-employment training offered by VTCs, and to ensure&#13;
sustained in-service training of the existing work force, the project would support: (a) strengthening&#13;
institutional capacity for curriculum development including trainee assessment and instructional material&#13;
development; (b) in-service training of trainers; (c) developing a system of continuing education for&#13;
employees of business and industry; (d) strengthening selected vocational training centers; and&#13;
(e) strengthening programs for rehabilitating the physically handicapped through vocational training. Sub-&#13;
project summaries are provided in Annex 9.&#13;
3.9   Strengthenine Institutional Capacitv for Curriculum Development Including Trainee Assessment&#13;
and Instructional Material Development (US$1.7 m). The project would support establishing a system of&#13;
curriculum development which includes performance standards, preparation of training materials, and skill&#13;
testing responsive to labor market demands, nationally and locally. This would be supported through TA&#13;
including foreign and local experts and overseas fellowships to the relevant General Directorates of&#13;
6/    Sub-project summaries are provided in Annex 9 and detailed write-ups are given in Implementation Volume 1.&#13;
Contents of Implementation Volumes are provided in Annex 10.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
GAVTT. With assistance from specialists, capabilities of VTCs would also be developed through in-&#13;
country training workshops, focussing on training of resource persons. A core group for curriculum&#13;
development, comprising resource persons developed through the project, would be set up in each VTC.&#13;
This group would liaise with the LTPACs in developing programs and curricula. About 60 percent of&#13;
time would be devoted to basic skill development to national standards, and the remaining time to job&#13;
specific skills in demand, locally. It would therefore be open to the LTPACs to consider options for&#13;
practical training through apprenticeship and enterprise-based training whenever and wherever feasible.&#13;
3.10   Developing a System of In-service Training of Trainers (US$2.2 mi). To complement the efforts&#13;
of National Institute for Vocational Instructor Training (NIVIT), supported by Germany, the project&#13;
would support in-service training of all instructors/trainers in the VTCs (already in sufficient numbers;&#13;
Background Table C, Annex 21). This would include pedagogic training, technical skill development, and&#13;
industrial training. In addition to pedagogic training which would be provided by NIVIT, trainer&#13;
development centers (TDCs) would be established in three identified VTCs in Aden, Sana'a and Taiz, in&#13;
trades not covered at NIVIT. Each TDC would have three master trainers with proficiency in&#13;
conventional skills as well as skills for new trades developed through overseas fellowships supported by&#13;
the project. The project would also support the provision of additional classrooms, audiovisual and other&#13;
training equipment for the TDCs. The TDCs would organize skill training/upgrading programs in&#13;
new/specialized trades for the trainers of VTCs utilizing its own and VTC facilities. TDCs would&#13;
collaborate with NIVIT and jointly plan the skill upgrading programs with a view to complement and not&#13;
duplicate NIVIT-organized programs. GAVTT would coordinate the industrial training of VTC trainers,&#13;
jointly supervised by TDCs and industry.&#13;
3.11   Developing a System of Continuing Education (US$3.5 m). To develop a system of continuing&#13;
education for the benefit of employees of business and industry, VTC instructors and graduates, the&#13;
project would support two initiatives. First, the project would establish continuing education programs at&#13;
VTCs. Technical assistance will be provided for development of managers of continuing education&#13;
programs in each VTC and the establishment of management information systems in this area. The&#13;
project would provide equipment, furniture and instructional material support. Continuing education&#13;
programs would operate on a full cost recovery basis (i.e., training fee); and second, the project would&#13;
establish a hi-tech center. This Center would meet the needs of industry, other employers and VTCs in&#13;
modern technologies with a special focus on maintenance of equipment. A feasibility study, to be&#13;
reviewed by IDA, would determine the location of the Center, which could either be in a VTC or in an&#13;
industry; specific hi-tech areas; and the professional development of the Director and Deputy Director of&#13;
the Center. In addition to supporting the provision of physical facilities if needed -- building and&#13;
equipment -- the project would support TA to develop master trainers and master instructor trainers in hi-&#13;
tech areas.&#13;
3.12   Strengthening Selected Vocational Training Center (US$28.9 m). To improve learning&#13;
environment, physical facilities and instructional resources, the project would support the strengthening of&#13;
12 industrial, two commerce VTCs, and one hotel and tourism institute in locations where demand for&#13;
trained labor has been verified, and programs to be deleted, revised, expanded or added have been&#13;
identified accordingly (Annex 11); health sector VTCs have been excluded as they are covered under&#13;
health sector projects. The support would include TA for the development of each VTC including shop&#13;
layout planning and provision for rehabilitation of existing physical facilities -- buildings, workshops --&#13;
equipment, furniture and educational materials for new programs. This would result in the establishment&#13;
of new programs for an enrollment of 1000 students and upgrading the facilities for about 4600 students.&#13;
3.13   The annual output of graduates from industrial and commercial VTCs would rise from some&#13;
2,100 in 1995 to about 2,800 in 2003. This would be less than two percent of present employment in&#13;
these sectors, and about 1.5 percent of employment expected in industry and commerce by the year 2003.&#13;
3.14   Rehabilitation of the Physically Handicapped through Vocational TraininR (US$1.3 m). To&#13;
integrate the handicapped with mainstream work force and to improve and expand their training, the&#13;
project would support rehabilitation of the physically handicapped through appropriate vocational training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the existing centers. The project would earmark US$1 million for this purpose. Existing VTCs or&#13;
community supported centers would apply for funds which would be scrutinized by a management&#13;
committee consisting of professionals established by the MSSL and supported through technical assistance&#13;
provided by the project. The criteria for selection of centers to be supported would include past&#13;
experience in training physically handicapped, availability of trainers, nature of programs being offered,&#13;
type of physically handicapped covered and community participation. The project would provide support&#13;
through necessary technical assistance and resources. All proposals above US$50,000 would be sent to&#13;
IDA for review (assurances during negotiations para. 6. 1(e)).&#13;
3.15   Selective Expansion (US$4.7 m). To meet skilled manpower demand in underserved regions the&#13;
project would support establishment of two pilot vocational training centers (capacity of 200 graduates at&#13;
each center) reflecting emerging trends in vocational training, e.g., cooperative programs, apprenticeship,&#13;
dual system, enterprise-based training. These centers would be selected, according to agreed criteria,&#13;
from the six already appraised by IDA (Annex 9). The support would include civil works, equipment,&#13;
furniture and educational materials, and instructor training (assurances during negotiations para. 6. 1(f)).&#13;
Adult Education and Training for Females (US$6.0 m)&#13;
3.16   To improve community ownership of adult education and training (AET) programs the project&#13;
would support: (i) development of institutional capacity of AET centers to design programs based on&#13;
participatory approaches; (ii) establishment of an AET project funding facility to support programs which&#13;
meet agreed criteria; and (iii) refinement of existing practices in marketing and access to credit&#13;
alternatives.&#13;
3.17   Institutional Development (US$1.1 m) would be supported through: (a) development of new&#13;
curriculum based on life skills literacy programs (such as functional literacy, numeracy including simple&#13;
bookeeping, health, nutrition, family planning, community hygiene, and legal rights and duties), and&#13;
training of instructors in literacy programs; (b) workshops and training of facilitators in participatory&#13;
approaches; (c) training of instructors in community identified income generating skills; (d) enhancing&#13;
management training through technical assistance to provide Directors of selected centers with the&#13;
opportunity to visit successful centers in other countries; and (e) organizing seminars and workshops for&#13;
further skills upgradation and exchange of experience among centers.&#13;
3.18   An AET Project Funding Facility (US$4.8 m) will support participating adult training centers to&#13;
implement reoriented programs by financing rehabilitation of buildings, equipment, instructional&#13;
materials, and vehicles based on agreed criteria. Proposals invited from AET centers would be required&#13;
to specify details of how centers plan to finance recurrent costs for facilities and equipment maintenance;&#13;
specify how they propose to obtain contributions from communities; how they would retain income&#13;
generated from training activities; and how they propose to utilize the contributions and earnings. The&#13;
project would review existing best practices and make suggestions for potential mechanisms that could be&#13;
linked with women graduating from the AET centers to launch into income generating activities.&#13;
Proposals above US$20,000 would be subject to IDA review (assurances during negotiations para.&#13;
6. 1 (g)).&#13;
3.19    The project would provide technical assistance to introduce AET centers and rural banks to&#13;
marketing and credit alternatives (US$0.2 m) to promote, in an organized manner, the production and&#13;
sale of marketable products of AET centers.&#13;

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Cost of the Proiect.&#13;
4.1    Summary of Project Costs. Project costs are estimated at YR5,978 million or US$59.8 million&#13;
equivalent (base costs estimated at YR5,162 million or US$51.6 million) and include construction, site&#13;
development and professional services for rehabilitation and expansion of existing buildings; provision of&#13;
furniture, equipment and vehicles; educational material; technical assistance consisting of specialist&#13;
services and fellowships; and operating expenses support to the Skill Development Fund (SDF).&#13;
Recurrent costs include additional staff as well as the maintenance of buildings and equipment. Foreign&#13;
exchange represents YR4,198 million (US$42.0 million) or 70 percent of total project cost. Local&#13;
currency costs are estimated at YRl,779 million (US$17.8 million). The summary of project cost by&#13;
project item and the summary of project costs by category of expenditure is given in Tables 1 and 2 in&#13;
Annex 12.&#13;
4.2    Basis of Cost Estimates. Cost of rehabilitating existing facilities including additions as necessary&#13;
is based on reviews of recently awarded contracts for similar facilities. These costs average US$300 per&#13;
sq. m. Architecture and Engineering fees for the design of the facilities are calculated at 10% of the&#13;
amount of construction. Cost estimates for equipment are based on unit prices for equipment recently&#13;
procured and on standard price lists provided by GAVTT. Furniture costs are based on current furniture&#13;
price lists and amount to 15 percent of construction. Technical assistance costs per staff month of&#13;
specialist services and fellowship training costs have been estimated on the basis of recent prices for&#13;
comparable technical assistance to Yemen. Base cost estimates reflect prices as projected at the time of&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
4.2.1  Cost and Areas per student. Area allocation for automotive shops was calculated at 45 sq. m. per&#13;
student; all other trades (electronics, carpentry, metal shop, etc.) were calculated at 18 sq. m. per student;&#13;
provision for equipment varies depending on the trade of the different shops/programs, from US$1,000 to&#13;
US$15,000, averaging US$2,000 per student place. This provision includes the rehabilitation of&#13;
existing/restructured programs and new programs.&#13;
4.3    Custom Duties and Taxes. Project costs include an estimated US$2.9 million in indirect taxes on&#13;
locally procured civil works and goods. Equipment and goods imported directly for use by government&#13;
agencies are exempt from duties and taxes.&#13;
4.4    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance of 9 percent of the&#13;
estimated cost of all project items for unforeseen physical additions (approximately US$4.8 million).&#13;
Price contingencies are estimated at US$3.4 million equivalent or 7 percent of the base cost plus physical&#13;
contingencies. Total contingencies represent 16 percent of the base cost.&#13;
4.5    Foreign Exchange component. The foreign exchange component will include: (a) rehabilitation&#13;
of existing facilities -- 52 percent; (b) furniture and educational material -- 80 percent; (c) equipment and&#13;
vehicles -- 90 percent; (d) specialist services -- 80 percent; (e) fellowships and study tours -- 100 percent&#13;
and (f) local training -- 30 percent. The resulting foreign exchange component including contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at US$42.0 or 70 percent of total project costs.&#13;
4.6    Recurrent Costs. The annual incremental recurrent costs of the project include personnel costs&#13;
estimated at YR2.2 million and for maintenance of buildings and equipment estimated at YR14.2 million&#13;
and YR29 million respectively. The project when completed will add a total of YR45.4 million annually&#13;
(base costs at December 1994 market prices) to the recurrent budget of the Government (See Table 3,&#13;
Annex 12). When this increase is compared with the additional resources for VT (YR40 million)&#13;
allocated from the SDF and other sources, the net increase in recurrent costs would only be YR5.4&#13;
million -- a negligible percentage of total budget (YR7.0 billion) of Yemen on education and training&#13;
(Table 2, Annex 8). Recurrent costs for salaries and maintenance would be provided annually and&#13;
information made available to IDA upon request (assurances during negotiations para. 6.1(h)).&#13;
&#13;

B. Financing&#13;
4.7   Project Financing. The proposed IDA credit of US$24.3 million in addition to OPEC Fund&#13;
contribution of US$10 million, as well as the Dutch Government, Japanese Government and European&#13;
Union co-financing of US$16.0 million would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange component&#13;
(US$42.0 million) of the project and 47 percent of local costs (US$8.3 million). The government of&#13;
Yemen would finance 53 percent of local costs which amount to US$9.5 million, which includes indirect&#13;
taxes of US$2.9 million. The financing plan is shown below.&#13;

and goods contracts costing more than US$ 200,000 would be procured through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA credits"&#13;
(January 1995). In the evaluation and comparison of bids for goods, domestic manufacturers would be&#13;
granted a margin of preference of 15 %, or the relevant duty, whichever is lower and for civil works&#13;
contracts, a margin of preference of 7.5 percent would be granted to domestic contractors who qualify, in&#13;
accordance with Appendix 2 of the Guidelines. All contracts would be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
The amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Annex 13.&#13;
4.9    Exceptions to ICB&#13;
(a)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$2.0 million or less per contract up to US$6.1 million in aggregate would be awarded on the basis of&#13;
NCB procedures, since the contracts are small, widely scattered geographically and unlikely to attract&#13;
foreign firms. Standard bidding documents agreed with IDA would be used. NCB procedures would (a)&#13;
incorporate explicit statements to bidders of qualification, bid evaluation and award procedures; (b) be&#13;
advertised widely in local papers, with bid openings in public; and (c) not exclude the participation of&#13;
interested bidders from other IDA member countries.&#13;
(b)   International Shopping (IS). Bid packages for goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 up to&#13;
an aggregate amount of US$4.3 million may be awarded under IS procedures based on comparing price&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers from at least two countries eligible under the Guidelines in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
(c)    National Shopping (NS). Bid packages for goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.3 million and containing small quantities of a great variety of items, may be&#13;
awarded under NS procedures based on comparing prices from at least three suppliers eligible under the&#13;
Guidelines in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
(d)    Technical Assistance. Contracts for technical assistance would be awarded following the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency." Consulting and training services in the amount of US$2.8 million and US$4.0 million&#13;
respectively, would be obtained mostly through consulting organizations. During negotiations the&#13;
Govermnent provided a short list of three agencies/institutions for IDA review for procurement of TA for&#13;
the VT components. The TA for the AET component would be managed by an NGO well established in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Yemen and having similar international experience (assurances during negotiations para. 6.1(i)).&#13;
Consultant appointments above US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals would be subject to&#13;
prior IDA view, as would the terms of reference, single source contracts and critical assignments&#13;
regardless of value.&#13;
4.10   During project supervision, IDA financed contracts for civil works above a threshold of&#13;
US$600,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures. The review process would cover&#13;
about 80 percent of the total value of civil works contracts. Contracts or packages for goods above&#13;
US$75,000 would also be subject to prior review, covering about 70 percent of the total value of Bank&#13;
financed goods. Contracts or packages for services above US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals would also be subject to prior review. Selective ex-post review of awarded contracts below&#13;
the threshold levels would be carried out on about 1 in 4 contracts for civil works and 1 in 8 contracts for&#13;
goods.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
4.11   The proposed project would be disbursed over a period of about 8 years in accordance with the&#13;
disbursement profile of eight and a half years for the education sector for Yemen as stated in the Standard&#13;
Disbursement Profiles of August 1993. All contracts financed by IDA would be denominated in foreign&#13;
currency (para. 2.15) (assurances during negotiations para 6.1(0)). Disbursements would be made against:&#13;
a)     80% of total expenditures for civil works contracts.&#13;
b)     100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs) and 90% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally.&#13;
c)     100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures for specialist services and&#13;
fellowships.&#13;
4.12   Disbursements from the proposed credit are expected to take place on average about 4 months&#13;
after expenditures are incurred. A disbursement schedule reflecting this and providing a comparison with&#13;
the above mentioned profile is shown in Annex 14. The closing date of the project is June 2003, and&#13;
disbursements are expected to be completed within four months of the closing date.&#13;
4.13   Disbursements against contracts for works less than US$600,000 equivalent, for goods less than&#13;
US$75,000, and for services less than US$100,000 (for firms) and US$50,000 (for individuals) would be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), available for examination by IDA missions.&#13;
The Government would establish, maintain and operate a special account in the borrower's Central Bank&#13;
and IDA would make an initial deposit equivalent to 50% of the amount of the authorized allocation&#13;
(US$1.0 million) until about US$1.5 million of the credit has been disbursed. The special account will be&#13;
replenished on a monthly basis. Withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate&#13;
documentation.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.14   The GAVTT implementation unit would maintain accounts for the vocational training components&#13;
of the project and would prepare all the documentation required by IDA: the MOE's PIU would do the&#13;
same for the adult education component. Project accounts, including the special account, would be&#13;
audited in accordance with the March 1982, "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank". IDA would be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal year&#13;
with an audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a separate opinion&#13;
by the auditor of disbursements against certified statements of expenditures. At the same time, IDA&#13;
would also be provided with an audit report on the scope and detail of the SDF as IDA may reasonably&#13;
request (assurances during negotiations para 6.1(k)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
F. Management and Implementation&#13;
4.15   Status of Project Preparation. The proposed project has been prepared by the Government with&#13;
the assistance of PHRD grants, and in close cooperation with representatives of relevant government&#13;
agencies and the private sector, coordinated by GAVTT. Major policy issues were extensively reviewed&#13;
with the Ministers of Labor, Education and Planning. In October 1994, the Federal Chamber of&#13;
Commerce and Industry, with IDA assistance arranged a seminar on VT management and financing,&#13;
chaired by the Prime Minister and bringing together government officials, vocational educators, private&#13;
sector representatives, NGOs and donor representatives. The seminar arrived at a series of policy&#13;
recommendations endorsed by both, the Government and private sector which form the basis for the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
4.16   The working groups prepared relevant proposals for each sub-component which were reviewed at&#13;
appraisal. These documents include: (a) detailed write-ups for each component; (b) technical assistance,&#13;
with detailed terms of reference, divided into four packages. A summary of the technical assistance, local&#13;
and foreign as well as training and fellowships provided under the project is given in Annex 15; (c)&#13;
equipment lists including instructional resources; (d) furniture and rehabilitation requirements for each&#13;
center; and (e) monitoring and impact indicators. For details see Implementation Volumes (Contents of&#13;
Implementation Volumes are provided in Annex 10).&#13;
4.17   Proiect Implementation. Under the supervision of the Minister of Social Services and Labor, the&#13;
Chairman of the General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT) would be responsible&#13;
for the overall coordination and day to day operations of the project's vocational training components. A&#13;
core project implementation unit (PIU) has been established within GAVTT for the duration of the&#13;
project. During negotiations the Government provided the Ministerial and GAVTT's decisions to this&#13;
effect. The PIU will be staffed with a nucleus of permanent personnel consisting of: a project&#13;
coordinator, an accountant, a project architect/engineer, a procurement specialist, a technical assistance&#13;
specialist and the necessary support staff (para. 2.15) (assurances during negotiations para 6.1(1)). All the&#13;
key staff for this new implementation unit would be trained through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
before the project becomes effective. The proposed project would adhere to implementation&#13;
arrangements agreed upon during the May 1995 CPPR (para. 2.15).&#13;
4.18   The Community-based Adult Education and Training component would be coordinated, managed&#13;
and implemented by the experienced PIU of the Ministry of Education. A female AET coordinator would&#13;
be appointed to manage this component under the supervision of the Vice-Minister of Education&#13;
(assurances during negotiations para. 6.1(m)). In addition, a technical committee with representation&#13;
from all the ministries involved in AET as well as NGOs would be established to review proposals and&#13;
monitor their implementation.&#13;
4.19  Implementation Schedule. The project is expected to be implemented over a period of 8 years,&#13;
starting April 1996. The project implementation schedule is provided in Annex 16.&#13;
4.20   Proiect Supervision and Monitoring. The project would be supervised according to an agreed&#13;
plan (Annex 17). Project implementation would be monitored by GAVTT for VT components and by the&#13;
PIU of MOE for the AET component. Components would be monitored according to input and output&#13;
performance indicators, and evaluated according to quantitative and qualitative adequacy (see&#13;
Implementation Volume No.1). A tracer study would be undertaken in 1999 when two batches from&#13;
rehabilitated VTCs have graduated. Overall project monitoring would be undertaken annually and reports&#13;
discussed with IDA supervision missions.&#13;
4.21   Mid-term Review. A mid-term review would be conducted jointly by IDA and the Government&#13;
no later than June 30, 1999 and would be based on an initial review conducted by GAVTT (NCVT&#13;
Council) and SDF Council, and by the MOE for the AET component.. A key focus of this review would&#13;
be the extent of private sector participation in the SDF, its operating procedures and the levels of support&#13;
needed by VTCs and private sector supported training (para. 3.5). The objectives and expected outcomes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
of the review are given in Annex 18 (assurances during negotiations para 6. 1(n)).&#13;
4.22   Impact Assessment. In order to assess the project's impact, baseline data and data obtained&#13;
during the life of the project would be compared with post project data. Measures would be taken to&#13;
obtain baseline data within the first year of project implementation and IDA would be provided with the&#13;
data (assurances during negotiations para. 6. 1(o)). GAVTT (and MOE for the AET component) would&#13;
establish baseline data and trends by gathering relevant information from VTCs and the SDF Council,&#13;
with regard to each indicator, and analyze and interpret data relevant to identified impact indicators&#13;
(Annex 19).&#13;
4.23   Proiect Sustainabilitv. Various project features would contribute to sustainability of the project.&#13;
They include: (a) institutional development of GAVTT and more autonomy to VTCs (para. 3.2); (b)&#13;
greater responsibility to private sector for VT and to communities for AET planning and management; (c)&#13;
additional resources for VT financing from the private sector which would reduce public financing of VT&#13;
from 100 percent at present to 66 percent by the year 2000 (Annex 8); (d) negligible increase (YR5.4&#13;
million) in recurrent budget of the government (para. 4.6); and (e) careful preparation of the project&#13;
which takes into account implementation risks for each component (Annex 20).&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1    The proposed project would make a significant contribution to the development of Yemen's&#13;
human resources. Major changes in policy and governance structure, already agreed with the&#13;
Government and private sector representatives, would result in shared responsibility between Government&#13;
and employers. The establishment of the SDF and mobilization of additional resources would lead to a&#13;
diversification of financial resources based on contributions from the main beneficiaries of vocational&#13;
training, i.e., students, employers and communities. Greater employer participation sought under the&#13;
project would enhance the relevance of training and strengthen the financial viability of the system. In&#13;
addition, the project would support the qualitative upgrading of VT system through comprehensive quality&#13;
improvement measures. By establishing a closer linkage between labor supply and demand, the project&#13;
would facilitate the employment of Yemenis in better paid jobs and thus increase family incomes and&#13;
reduce poverty. The project would also enhance employment and income generating opportunities for&#13;
women by teaching them marketable skills. In the longer term, these changes would provide a strong&#13;
basis for possible future expansion of VT through private sector initiatives, both for pre-employment and&#13;
in-service training, in line with emerging labor demand.&#13;
5.2    Overtime, the project would generate significant economic benefits on a sustained basis,&#13;
generating an internal rate of return (IRR) of about 16 percent. A sensitivity analysis has shown this&#13;
estimate to be robust (see Annex 22). Additional benefits not quantified in these calculations would&#13;
accrue from the training of handicapped persons, and from literacy and health education of women.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.3    Given the persistence of implementation delays in the last five years, the project implementation&#13;
strategy takes into account risk analysis (Annex 20) which has been carefully prepared with the Yemeni&#13;
preparation team. The proposed project entails the following potential risks: (a) the capacity of MSSL&#13;
and the newly established GAVTT to adequately plan and implement a major reform program for VT in&#13;
the face of significant administrative and financial constraints. This risk has been minimized by the&#13;
institutional development of GAVTT through active involvement of the entire GAVTT staff during project&#13;
preparation, training of GAVTT staff through a PPF, carefully prepared TA package and by prior&#13;
agreement on specific policy actions, and would be further minimized through the presence of the German&#13;
technical assistance team; (b) the need for close coordination among several government agencies involved&#13;
in VT. This risk would be mitigated through project benefits made available to the ministries who follow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
policy guidelines approved by GAVTT; (c) slow implementation and disbursement. This risk would be&#13;
minimized through the preparation of civil works bidding documents before project effectiveness through&#13;
a PPF, early procurement of TA and through other measures detailed in Annex 20; in addition, remedial&#13;
actions set out during the May 1995 CPPR are expected to have a positive impact on the implementation&#13;
of the proposed project; (d) lack of experience within the MOE to plan and implement community-based&#13;
AET initiatives. This risk would be minimized through training of trainers and Directors of AET centers&#13;
in participatory approaches, and through technical assistance contract being awarded to a well established&#13;
NGO in Yemen; and (e) cofinancing may not materialize. The project would be appropiately downsized&#13;
by reducing support to fewer than 15 VTCs.&#13;
VI. ACTIONS AGREED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1    During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:&#13;
(a)    The policies articulated in the policy statement will be carried out during the implementation&#13;
period (para. 3.2).&#13;
(b)    The project would support only those centers willing to implement policies formulated by NCVT&#13;
and monitored by GAVTT (para. 3.2).&#13;
(c)    The income generated by centers offering VT and AET would be retained by the respective&#13;
centers within the policy guidelines formulated by the Government (para. 3.5).&#13;
(d)    SDF contributions to VTCs would be according to agreed criteria (paras. 3.5 and 4.21).&#13;
(e)    Support to training centers for the physically handicapped would be according to agreed criteria&#13;
and that all proposals above US$50,000 would be sent to IDA for review (para. 3.14).&#13;
(f)    Support to two pilot VTCs would be according to agreed criteria and that proposals would be sent&#13;
to IDA for review (para. 3.15).&#13;
(g)    Support to AET centers for females would be according to agreed criteria, and would also&#13;
include centers operated by NGOs, and that all proposals above US$20,000 would be sent&#13;
to IDA for review (para. 3.17).&#13;
(h)    Recurrent budget to cover salaries and maintenance of buildings and equipment would be&#13;
provided for VTCs and AET centers, and that the information would be made available to IDA&#13;
(para. 4.6).&#13;
(i)    TA for the AET component would be managed by one of the NGOs well established in Yemen&#13;
and having similar international experience (para. 4.9(d)).&#13;
(j)    All contracts financed by IDA will be denominated in foreign currency (para. 4.11).&#13;
(k)   IDA will be provided within six months of the end of the each fiscal year, as part of audit&#13;
requirements, an audit report on the scope and detail of the SDF as IDA may reasonably request&#13;
(para. 4.14).&#13;
(I)    The core staff of the new project implementation unit established at GAVTT will be maintained&#13;
for the duration of the project with the required personnel, functions and authority agreed upon&#13;
with the Bank (para. 4.17).&#13;
(m)   A female coordinator for AET would be appointed by June 1, 1996, and a technical committee&#13;
with representation from concerned ministries and NGOs would be established (para. 4.18).&#13;
(n)    A joint mid-term review would be conducted before December, 1999 (para 4.21).&#13;
(o)    Measures would be taken to obtain baseline data within the first year of project implementation&#13;
and IDA would be provided with the data (para. 4.22).&#13;
6.2   Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of&#13;
US$24.3 million equivalent to the Government of Yemen.&#13;

Subject:    Sector Policy Statement&#13;
Dear Sir,&#13;
Vocational training in the past has essentially been a responsibility of&#13;
the Govemment with virtually no private sector involvement. The results have&#13;
not been satisfactory: training programs are of inferior quality, management&#13;
structures are weak, and training centers are operating under severe&#13;
financial constraints. To overcome these problems and to ensure that the&#13;
services delivered are of appropriate quality as well as responsive to actual&#13;
skill needs, the Government has accepted a new strategy for vocational&#13;
training based on an expanding involvement of the private sector in the&#13;
governance and financing of the system while reducing the role of the public&#13;
sector in providing these services. More emphasis will also be given to the&#13;
training of undprprivileged groups, especially, women, to enhance their&#13;
productivity and income generating skills.&#13;
To strengthen the capability for sector policy formulation, a National Council&#13;
for Vocational Training is being established with majority representation&#13;
provided by the private sector. The Council will receive operational support&#13;
from  the  General  Authority  for  Vocational- Training. Management&#13;

responsibility for individual training centers will be decentralized and will be&#13;
transferred to Local Councils for Vocational Training whose members would&#13;
represent employers, labor and local communities. This will give the training&#13;
centers more autonomy and flexibility to design programs responsive to&#13;
market demand.&#13;
New sources of finance will be developed to reduce dependence on&#13;
govemment funding. The resources would come from the principal&#13;
beneficiaries of vocational training, i.e., employers, students and&#13;
communities. The main instrument will be a Skill Development Fund to be&#13;
financed by a training levy raised from industrial and commercial firms. The&#13;
Fund will be managed by a council in which private sector representatives&#13;
have a clear majority. Other resources will be raised through voluntary&#13;
contributions by the private sector and local communities, and through&#13;
income generated by training centers from selling goods and services in local&#13;
markets. Student subsidies will be phased out in two years, and tution fees&#13;
will be introduced with scholarships provisions for needy students.&#13;
Private sector initiatives to provide pre- and in-service training will be&#13;
actively encouraged by the Govemmert&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
DEMAND FOR SKILLED LABOR FROM NEW INVESTMENT&#13;
1.    Soon after unification, in May 1992, the Govermnent established an independent (outside of&#13;
any ministry) General Investment Authority (GIA), chaired by the Prime Minister, to promote private&#13;
investment in the country. The GIA has four branches across the country (serving all governorates),&#13;
of which the Sana'a and Aden branches have already started to license and monitor specific&#13;
investment projects.&#13;
2.    According to officials of the Sana'a branch, non-government investments have been growing&#13;
rapidly since 1992. The change is attributable to GIA's active role in informing potential foreign and&#13;
local investors about business opportunities in Yemen. Moreover, the open, regulation-free context&#13;
within the country has also been instrumental in attracting investments. The attached charts (Charts&#13;
L.a and b) show the number of projects licensed by the GIA, the projects that are starting up and&#13;
project assets by economic sector (between March 1992 and December 9, 1994).&#13;
3.    The Head Office in Sana'a has licensed 543 projects during that period. Of these, 232&#13;
projects are already starting up. In addition, the Aden branch has licensed another 670 projects. The&#13;
projects licensed by the Sana'a branch alone are expected to generate as many as 28,000 new jobs&#13;
within the next few years. No job estimates were available for projects licensed by the Aden branch.&#13;
4.    With regard to investment by governorates, Chart 2 shows that most of the projects will be&#13;
starting up in Sana'a, followed by Taiz and Aden. Overall, these initial figures suggest a rapidly&#13;
growing labor demand in specific sectors and regions of the country.&#13;

VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
PRESENT ISSUES IN PRE-EMPLOYMENT TRAINING&#13;
Oualitv and Relevance&#13;
1.    There are major deficiencies in the quality and relevance of VT programs. Curricula are&#13;
outdated and renewals that were undertaken in some cases during the late eighties by supervisors and&#13;
instructors, with little involvement of the end users of graduates, have resulted in only marginal&#13;
modifications. Curricula therefore lack relevance to skill demands of industry and other user systems.&#13;
There are no professional units either in GAVTT or in the VTCs, with competence to systematically&#13;
evaluate and develop VT curricula, nor is there an information system to gather periodic feedback&#13;
from employers and past graduates.&#13;
2.    Curriculum details vary widely between VTCs, even for the same trades and such variations&#13;
have no relevance to local demands. In most cases the time allocated for practical work is limited,&#13;
not providing for adequate hands-on experience. Moreover, trainees do not get the opportunity for&#13;
practical training in enterprises and, therefore, lack exposure to real work situations. This further&#13;
contributes to the lack of relevance of practical work provided within the VTCs.&#13;
3.    Practices with regard to trainee assessment vary considerably among institutions. They are&#13;
usually limited to end of year examinations with no continuous evaluation of the performance of&#13;
trainees. The criteria for passing also vary among VTCs, and there are no properly defined skills&#13;
testing standards at the national level.&#13;
4.    While the average teacher-student ratios are adequate in most VTCs (9 for industrial and 16&#13;
for commercial), the qualifications of instructors vary considerably among institutions. There are&#13;
trainers with engineering degrees, highly knowledgeable in theoretical subjects but lacking in practical&#13;
skills, and there are also instructors who are recent VTC graduates with limited industrial/work&#13;
experience. The National Institute for Vocational Instructor Training (NIVIT) in Aden offers limited&#13;
short-term courses to upgrade and develop the skills of teaching staff. Courses are proposed to be&#13;
strengthened with assistance from Germany.&#13;
5.    VTC buildings, in general, require extensive renovation. The extent of renovation required&#13;
varies between VTCs. Available equipment are either outdated or are in need of major repairs.&#13;
Consistently low maintenance budgets have aggravated the situation. In a few VTCs, the recent civil&#13;
war has rendered the centers dysfunctional.&#13;
6.    These weaknesses in the VTS have contributed to low achievement levels of trainees. The&#13;
skills they acquire in the VTCs often do not match market demand with the result that most graduates&#13;
cannot compete with expatriates for employment in industry and commerce. A tracer study conducted&#13;
by the Germany Advisory Team in 1990 has found that most graduates have turned to the public&#13;
sector for jobs. Even there, almost half of the graduates were employed in positions for which they&#13;
were not trained. Very few of the graduates have found employment in the private sector or&#13;
established their own workshops. To change this situation and to make graduates more competitive in&#13;
the labor market, training programs will have to be substantially strengthened and their relevance for&#13;
changing market conditions enhanced. This requires close cooperation with potential employers and&#13;
the communities that VTCs are expected to serve.&#13;
&#13;

7.      With the exception of four large private sector companies (Hayel Saeed Group of Companies,&#13;
Thabet Brothers, Al-Thawarah Industrial Comples: a group of 20 small companies, and Yemen Hunt&#13;
Oil Company), business and industry do not have their own facilities for skill upgradation.&#13;
Moreover, the VT system does not offer such opportunities through continuing education programs.&#13;
In order to respond to changes in technology, foreign workers with new skills in modern and high&#13;
technologies are recruited. There are neither facilities nor training competence within the country to&#13;
meet the demand. The lack of opportunities in continuing education and in hi-tech areas is&#13;
contributing to stagnation of Yemeni workers and obsolescence of VTC programs.&#13;
Access and Eguitv&#13;
8.      Coverage of vocational training is seriously handicapped by the small size of the system. Of&#13;
the 15 industrial and commercial VTCs, 11 are located in 4 of the country's 18 governorates (Sana'a,&#13;
Aden, Abyan, and Hadramout). Another four governorates have one VTC each (Hodeidah, Dhamar,&#13;
Taiz and Lahej) while the remaining 10 governorates have no training facilities at all (see Background&#13;
Table B in Annex 21). While the geographic distribution of VTCs reflects to some extent differences&#13;
in economic activity, it is also clear that the complete absence of training facilities in large parts of&#13;
the country restricts investments in these areas, and deprives many potential students from acquiring&#13;
skills and competing for higher paid jobs in other parts of the country.&#13;
9.      In Yemen, there are no formal estimates of physically handicapped population and their&#13;
grouping on the basis of type of disability. According to MSSL there are about 200,000 physically&#13;
handicapped who could be rehabilitated through appropriate vocational training. Available facilities in&#13;
the country for rehabilitating the handicapped through vocational training are very limited. At&#13;
present, there are some 20 centers managed by NGOs, private sector, MSSL and MOH. Training in&#13;
these centers faces similar issues of quality, relevance and financial constraints as described above.&#13;
10.    In spite of increasing enrollments at all levels of education', overall female participation in&#13;
vocational training is low and limited to the commerce and health sectors only. Changes in&#13;
socioeconomic values are giving rise to a more positive outlook toward employment of females.&#13;
Parental support for female education is on the increase and is more pronounced in females only&#13;
centers. Females are therefore increasingly entering modern sectors in which appropriate training&#13;
opportunities exist. There is demand for female vocational training in specializations which are&#13;
considered culturally appropriate (e.g., food processing, garment making, etc).&#13;

1/     In 1990, illiteracy rates were 74% for women and 47% for men; primary gross enrollment ratio for girls was 37% and&#13;
112% for boys in the former Yemen Arab Republic and 67% for girls and 109% for boys in the former Democratic&#13;
Yemen. (World Education Report, UNESCO, 1993) Although the Government is making serious efforts to increase&#13;
girls education, universal primary education will not be attained for sometime. In addition, there remains a whole&#13;
generation of adolescent girls and women which has been excluded from the formal education system.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
ISSUES IN ADULT EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
1.    In Yemen, adult education and training (AET) programs are intended for adults who have not been able&#13;
to take advantage of the formal education and training system. The programs are popular among women, who&#13;
attend them in high numbers'. There are over 40 non-formal AET centers run by various ministries and&#13;
NGOs. The Ministries of Education (MOE), Social Security, Social Services and Labor (MSSL), Agriculture&#13;
and Water Resources (MAWR) and NGOs are active in providing literacy, numeracy, and basic income&#13;
generating skills for adults. AET programs are intended to increase welfare, productivity and incomes of rural&#13;
and urban populations, not reached by formal eduation or training programs.&#13;
2.     There are two fundamental drawbacks of AET in Yemen: (i) limited range of programs being offered;&#13;
and (ii) poor quality and relevance of training. Related issues include the following:&#13;
(a) Ministries responsible for AET centers are unable to meet recurrent costs of the institutions due to severe&#13;
financial constraints. Consequently, buildings and equipment have deteriorated, supplies are limited, and&#13;
centers are operated on shoestring budgets. Centralized control of finances and staffing of training centers has&#13;
resulted in loss of initiative at the institutional level. Government policy does not permit centers to retain&#13;
income from training activities. Due to the above reasons, viable income generating activities have not been&#13;
implemented. Financial problems have further been aggravated as trainees are exempt from paying tuition fees.&#13;
Trainees, however, out of necessity do pay the cost of supplies for their training programs.&#13;
(b)    Programs are organized in line with the academic school year. This has resulted in months of inactivity&#13;
in the centers. Training sessions are often held during inconvenient hours, such as when women are required to&#13;
complete household chores. Moreover, facilities for trainees such as daycare centers, where they do exist, are&#13;
open only for a limited number of hours during the day, making it inconvenient for trainees to take advantage of&#13;
the facility at other times. Access to training equipment such as typewriters, sewing machines is limited and in&#13;
poor condition. Consequently, trainees get limited hands-on experience.&#13;
(c)    Trainers lack adequate training in their field of specialty, particularly in adult pedagogy and up-to-date&#13;
craftsmanship. This is reflected in the poor quality of goods produced by trainees during training. AET centers&#13;
at both the central ministerial and local levels are operated as welfare activities rather than as educational and&#13;
skills development facilities. No standards are applied, and teachers are paid only a "token allowance", not a&#13;
salary.&#13;
(d)    Community participation in identifying local needs, in providing inputs into program design and in&#13;
contributing to the upkeep of the centers is absent. As a result of inadequate analysis, training centers tend to&#13;
offer courses which are often irrelevant to local needs.&#13;
(e)    Women's ability to generate income either through self-employment or through cooperative&#13;
arrangements are hampered by absence of skills training in managing productive activities and by lack of access&#13;
to capital. Financial institutions offer limited facilities for credit to small entrepreneurs. Appropriate training&#13;
for women such as in fundamentals of collective bargaining and joint liability mechanisms to promote access to&#13;
capital markets is absent.&#13;
3.     The main institutional structures required to upgrade AET centers are already in place. Efforts must be&#13;
made to reorient programs to elicit greater community participation, to ensure that AET programs are demand&#13;
driven, and they provide life skills literacy and relevant and marketable income generation programs.&#13;
1/    In a survey of 24 centers, total enrollment was estimated to be 5,000. Of this number around 90% were females. Source: Mission&#13;
estimates.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
GOVERNANCE OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING SYSTEM'&#13;
1.    Currently, management of the Vocational Training System (VTS) in Yemen is characterized as:&#13;
o     having weak linkages with the private sector.&#13;
o     lacking adequate procedures for formulating policy and for planning or&#13;
monitoring programs.&#13;
o     having training programs that are not relevant to private sector demands.&#13;
O     being highly fragmented because coordination among the various ministries&#13;
responsible for Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) is difficult.&#13;
2.    To strengthen the VTS, a management structure should be adopted that will:&#13;
o     Ensure involvement of the private sector in the planning and management&#13;
process.&#13;
o     Provide for development of policies, plans and procedures for management.&#13;
O     Provide for more flexibility, autonomy and accountability at the local level.&#13;
O     Unify the VTS through formulation of appropriate policies and procedures&#13;
applicable to all VTCs.&#13;
3.    Structure of VTS: Figure 1 shows the structure of VTS and the interrelationships between&#13;
components. The following is a brief description of each component:&#13;
3.1    The National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) provides the overall policy framework for all&#13;
VTCs in the Vocational Training System. It also advises the Minister on issues of concern. Membership of&#13;
NCVT would comprise: six members representing relevant ministries; Chairman of GAVTT; eight employer&#13;
representatives (contributing members of the SDF) nominated by regional Chambers of Conunerce; one&#13;
member of the National Labor Association; one member of the Agriculture Federation; one representative of&#13;
Yemeni Women's Union; VT expert nominated by SDF Council; Chairman SDF Council; one director of&#13;
VTC nominated by GAVTT. Out of 21 members, 13 would belong to private sector and non-government&#13;
organizations.&#13;
3.2    GAVTT, through its Chairman would provide operational support to the NCVT for carrying out its&#13;
mandate. It would prepare national plans for vocational training and monitor policy implementation in a&#13;
number of major functional areas which would include:&#13;
o     Curriculum development and implementation&#13;
o     Institutional and staff development in cooperation with National Institute for&#13;
Vocational Instructors Training (NIVIT)&#13;
o     Accreditation of programs&#13;
o     Job classification and skill assessment&#13;
o     Financial and organizational management&#13;
o     Planning and research&#13;
3.3    The Local Councils for Vocational Training (LCVT) are the local governing boards which would be&#13;
responsible for the organizational, administrative, staffing and instructional program needs of the respective&#13;
VTCs. Council memberships would be comprised of representatives from both the public and private sectors&#13;
I   For details of operational procedures for governance of VTS refer Implementation Volume 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
with private sector membership being the majority.2 The Chairpersons would be elected from the&#13;
membership and the VTC Director(s) would serve as ex-officio member(s). In cities where there are multiple&#13;
VTCs there would be only one LCVT governing the VTCs in the area. LCVTs responsibilities include:&#13;
o      Establishing, systematically reviewing and monitoring the VTCs' decision-&#13;
making process including instructional and administrative policies.&#13;
o      Approving and monitoring VTCs' organizational staffing including&#13;
administrative, support and teaching staff appointments, terminations and&#13;
salaries.&#13;
o      Ensuring VTCs' effectiveness and viability by reviewing and approving annual&#13;
operational plans, objectives and budgets.&#13;
o      Representing the VTCs externally to the communities served by the VTCs.&#13;
3.4    Local Training Program Advisory Committees (LTPACs): The VTCs would establish external&#13;
program advisory committees for each program specialization area. These committees would provide&#13;
leadership and, because of their diverse membership, a holistic approach to the issue of programs and&#13;
program standards.&#13;
o      Committee membership would include local participants from business,&#13;
industry, labor, public services and other relevant constituencies.&#13;
o      Individuals to be appointed to membership would be nominated by the&#13;
respective program representative and formally appointed by the Director of&#13;
the Center. The LCVT would only need to be informed.&#13;
o      The LTPACs would be responsible for conducting program needs&#13;
assessments; assessing program relevance; analyzing the curriculum content;&#13;
identifying related training areas which need to be developed; assessing&#13;
suitability of training facilities and equipment; and providing an external&#13;
linkage by informing the community about programs, services and the quality&#13;
of its graduates.&#13;
3.5     Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) would operate within the policy framework approved by the&#13;
NCVT. They would be responsible for, but not restricted to the following tasks:&#13;
o      Enrollment and management of students&#13;
o      Management of curricula and instructional materials&#13;
o      Delivery of instruction&#13;
o      Management of equipment and facilities&#13;
o      Routine administrative details&#13;
4.     Advantages of the Structure&#13;
-      It will provide for greater program flexibility, institutional autonomy and institutional&#13;
accountability because the VTCs' governance will be at the local level, in accordance with&#13;
established national standards and policies.&#13;
-      Formal linkages will be established with the private sector, giving the private sector&#13;
opportunities to participate in the management of the training system.&#13;
-      Courses and Programs offered by the VTCs will be based on market demand.&#13;
-      GAVTT can focus on policy formulation, institutional support, organizational management&#13;
and monitoring of national standards rather than on routine administration of institutions.&#13;
2   LCVT membership would comprise (i) six representatives from contributing employers to the SDF -- 2 from private sector,&#13;
2 from public sector, one nominated by the labor union and one nominated by the Govemor; (ii) one nominee of GAVTT;&#13;
(iii) one professional, a specialist in VT, nominated by SDF Council; and (iv) the Director of the VTC.&#13;

OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR THE SKILL DEVELOPMENT FUND&#13;
This document sets forth procedures for management of the Skill Development Fund (SDF), as well&#13;
as operation of the SDF Council. It also outlines the conditions under which Vocational Training&#13;
Centers (VTCs) and employers may qualify for financial support for training.&#13;
I.    The Skill Development Fund (SDF)&#13;
1.    Overview&#13;
1.1   The Skill Development Fund (SDF) is aimed at (a) mobilizing significantly more resources for&#13;
both pre-employment and employee training; and (b) reorienting financing from government to private&#13;
sources. It is administered by an SDF Council comprised of major representation from contributing&#13;
employers. A financing scheme is given in Figure 1.&#13;
1.2   Because the Skill Development Fund is a new concept to vocational training in Yemen, a joint&#13;
review of progress by the SDF Council, General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training&#13;
(GAVTT) and the International Development Association (IDA) will be conducted two years after&#13;
implementation with biennial reviews thereafter.&#13;
2.    Source of Funds&#13;
2.1    Resources required to finance the Skill Development Fund include the following:&#13;
(a)    Work Permit Fee of YR5,000 p.a. per non-Yemeni worker.&#13;
(b)    Training Levy amounting to one percent of the total wage bill of&#13;
registered enterprises.&#13;
2.2    Additional financial resources will be required during the initial stages of development of the&#13;
SDF to successfully launch the program. It is proposed that the Government and IDA contribute an&#13;
amount, to be negotiated, as start-up funds. The Government may want to pay its share in a&#13;
lumpsum or stagger the payment over a period of three years.&#13;
3.    Coverage&#13;
3.1    Registered enterprises with 10 or more employees are to be covered by the Fund. As defined&#13;
by the SDF Council from time to time, an employee is any citizen of Yemen who is employed for&#13;
wages with an employer, irrespective of whether it is permanent, temporary, or contract employment.&#13;
3.2    The types of enterprises to be covered by the Skill Development Fund include:&#13;
a.    Industry&#13;
b.    Commerce&#13;
c.    Other enterprises and services such as hotel and tourism not readily&#13;
classified as industry or commerce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;

4.    Training levy and work permit assessments&#13;
4.1    The training levy, equal to one percent of the total monthly wages, allowances, and bonuses&#13;
paid to employees, will be assessed on employers registered under the SDF. Payments should be&#13;
made on a monthly basis. The SDF Council Secretariat will be responsible for receiving the fees&#13;
and monitoring their collection according to standard auditing and accounting practices.&#13;
4.2   The annual work permit fee of YR5,000 will be assessed for each worker who is not a&#13;
citizen of Yemen. This fee will be collected by the Ministry of Social Service and Labor (MSSL) at&#13;
the time of registration for a work permit. These fees collected by the MSSL will be remitted&#13;
directly to the SDF Council Secretariat.&#13;
4.3    All contributions to the SDF will be tax exempt.&#13;
4.4    Any employer who fails to pay any levy due within such period as may be prescribed is&#13;
subject to the following penalties:&#13;
a. One month late: Written notice&#13;
b. Six months late: Additional 25% of the levy&#13;
c. One year late: Additional 50% of the levy&#13;
d. Late more than one year: Referred to court for action&#13;
5.    Identification and registration of employers&#13;
5.1    The sources for identification of qualified employers are:&#13;
a.    Listings of employer organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and&#13;
Industry.&#13;
b.    Government agency records.&#13;
5.2    Once all qualified employers are identified they will be registered and assigned a code number&#13;
to be used for all SDF correspondence, payment of training levy, approval of training grants and&#13;
eventual disbursement of funds.&#13;
6.    Allocation of Funds&#13;
6.1    The SDF would be fully operational in about two years. As more firms join, its revenue&#13;
would expand. In the initial stage half of the funds collected under the SDF shall be used to help&#13;
finance the VTCs. As the revenue in the SDF increases, the share designated for VTCs will be&#13;
gradually reduced. The funds are to be used to improve the quality of training by complementing&#13;
government financing according to the following priorities:&#13;
a.    Maintenance of equipment and workshop facilities;&#13;
b.    Purchase of consumable training materials;&#13;
c.    Curriculum development;&#13;
d.    Retraining and skills upgrading of trainers/instructors/teachers;&#13;
e.    Short-term employment of expert teachers from industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
6.2    Funds will be distributed to VTCs on the basis of actual expenditures. Each VTC will&#13;
submit an annual budget to the SDF Council, and would be entitled to 10 percent of the approved&#13;
SDF budget, as an advance to the revolving fund for VTCs. Reimbursement for maintenance of&#13;
equipment (for key equipment requiring maintenance contract), and purchase of consumable training&#13;
materials - YR 10 million maximum; for curriculum development - actual costs; for retraining and&#13;
skills upgrading of trainers/instructors/teachers - actual costs for 15 percent of instructional personnel&#13;
per VTC; and, for short-term employment of expert teachers - actual costs. Annual reimbursement for&#13;
each VTC shall normally not exceed 30 percent of the salary budget.&#13;
6.3    The quality of training will be considered for continued support of VTCs through the SDF.&#13;
Quality indicators including test results, student enrollments, attrition, graduation and placement rates&#13;
will be monitored carefully by the SDF Council using relevant reports available through the GAVTT.&#13;
Also, faculty development, curriculum development, instructional improvement and quality of training&#13;
facilities will be considered.&#13;
6.4    Any VTC not performing satisfactorily will be so advised. The SDF Council and GAVTT&#13;
will develop a plan of action to be implemented by that VTC. One year will be given for correction&#13;
and improvement. The grant from the SDF may be reduced until reasonable progress is shown.&#13;
6.5    By the end of the third year of the SDF, the Council should develop and adopt a formula for&#13;
distribution of funds that is based on unit costs per student and considers pertinent quality indicators&#13;
to streamline administrative procedures.&#13;
6.6    The remaining 50 percent of the SDF, or more as the fund expands, shall be available to&#13;
employers for in-service training. These funds can be accessed by applying to the SDF Council in&#13;
accordance with established procedures (see paras. 7, 8 and 9).&#13;
7.    Employee Categories&#13;
7.1    Categories of employees and level of financial support from the Fund will be as follows:&#13;
a. Workers not less than 60% of SDF allocation&#13;
b. Supervisors and managers not more than 30% of SDF allocation&#13;
7.2    All training and retraining must be viewed as cost sharing between employers and the SDF.&#13;
Eighty percent of the costs of approved training programs or activities will be reimbursed by the&#13;
Council. Employers may be reimbursed up to the amount of training levy paid for the current year.&#13;
8.    Eligibility for funding&#13;
8.1    Employers, registered with the SDF Council, having paid the training levy for a continuous&#13;
period of six months are eligible to apply for training grants to support training/retraining within&#13;
their organization in accordance with policies regarding the award of grants. All trainees participating&#13;
in programs supported by the SDF must be employees of members of the SDF and citizens of&#13;
Yemen.&#13;

i.      Office furniture&#13;
ii.     Computer hardware to maintain databases, financial records, etc.&#13;
iii.    Appropriate computer software&#13;
c.      Cost of Operation&#13;
It is estimated that the cost of operation for the SDF Secretariat will&#13;
be YR250,000-300,000 per month or YR 3-3.6 million annually. The&#13;
initial investment required to establish the Secretariat and the operating&#13;
costs should be covered by the money contributed by the Government&#13;
and IDA. The cost of operation should not exceed five percent of the&#13;
SDF once the fund is established.&#13;
III.    Accountability&#13;
14.    The SDF account will be managed according to standard accounting practices. The General&#13;
Director of the Secretariat will prepare and submit bi-annual financial reports and annual budgets to&#13;
the Chairman for the Council's approval.&#13;
IV.    Training Schemes&#13;
15.    Overview&#13;
15.1   Various training schemes are available to enable employers registered with the SDF Council&#13;
to access the SDF. The main funding scheme, the Employer-Proposed Scheme in this document, is&#13;
described in detail. Brief summaries of two additional schemes, which can be implemented later, are&#13;
also presented.&#13;
I/   The suggested is the minimum staffmg required and as the SDF expands, more staff would become necessary,&#13;
particularly the numbers of accountants and professional staff to assist the Chief Executive Officer. The annual cost&#13;
of operations takes this expansion into account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
16.    The Employer-Proposed Scheme&#13;
16.1   This is the SDF's principal funding scheme. Financial assistance in the form of training&#13;
grants can be considered for various types of programs for the retraining and skills upgrading of&#13;
employees relevant to the needs of employers under this scheme. Employers are free to submit their&#13;
training proposals for the approval by the SDF Secretariat.&#13;
a.     Principles of Operation&#13;
i.     Training grants are offered to employers as incentives for retraining and&#13;
skills upgrading. The grants are not given as subsidies for training;&#13;
ii.    Training grants are awarded only for training programs based on&#13;
identified employer needs to ensure workplace accountability;&#13;
iii.    Prior approval of the SDF Council Secretariat is&#13;
necessary. Training costs are reimbursed on a claimed&#13;
basis.&#13;
b.     Eligibility Criteria for Emplovers&#13;
i.     Registered with the SDF Council for at least six months;&#13;
ii.    Training programs must be of direct benefit to their business&#13;
operations;&#13;
iii.    Training programs must be structured and have the following:&#13;
- specific training objectives, i.e. the skills to be upgraded and the&#13;
knowledge to be enhanced must be specified;&#13;
- specific training activities and/or lesson plans;&#13;
- specific duration of training;&#13;
- qualified instructor(s);&#13;
- formal performance assessment of trainees.&#13;
iv.    All training expenses incurred on the training program(s) must be borne&#13;
by the employer and not the trainee(s);&#13;
V.     Trainee(s) must complete the full program/course with a minimum attendance&#13;
of 75% and sit for all examinations where training leads to certification.&#13;
17.    Modes of Training&#13;
17.1   As the Employer-proposed Scheme is a comprehensive training scheme, the following modes&#13;
of training are allowed:&#13;
a.     EnterMrise-based Training. Employers develop their own in-house&#13;
training programs to improve employee skills and enhance productivity.&#13;
Enterprise-based training can be provided on-the-job under the guidance of a&#13;
trained supervisor or it can be provided off-the-job in employer-owned&#13;
training centers.&#13;
b.    Institution-based Training.  Training offered by providers such as&#13;
public/private training institutions, consultancy firms, industry-managed&#13;
training centers, Chambers of Commerce and industry associations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
c.     Cooperative-type Training. Large enterprises with excess training&#13;
capacities can offer training places to employees of small enterprises.&#13;
d.     Other forms of training e.g., apprenticeship, contract&#13;
training, etc.&#13;
18.   Other Training Schemes&#13;
18.1   Various training schemes should be developed to enable employers to participate in support&#13;
from the SDF. Brief descriptions of the two most common schemes used by skill development funds&#13;
in other countries are presented for consideration.&#13;
a.     The Approved Training Program (ATP) Scheme. Training offered through the&#13;
Approved Training Program (ATP) Scheme are usually offered by training providers&#13;
from the public or private sector. Providers must be registered with the SDF&#13;
Council. Employers may select training programs from a list of approved training&#13;
courses/programs, are not required to seek prior approval of the SDF Council and&#13;
may receive allowable costs on a reimbursement basis.&#13;
b.    The Annual Scheme. Employers may develop and use an annual training plan&#13;
which is approved by the SDF Council for support from the Fund. The Annual&#13;
Scheme is based on the following conditions:&#13;
- An annual plan of significant training activities is required;&#13;
- The training plan must cover at least 10% of the company's workforce;&#13;
- The plan must be systematic;&#13;
- The plan must consist of programs relevant to the company's&#13;
corporate needs;&#13;
- The plan must provide for monitoring and evaluating training effectiveness.&#13;
19.   Application Procedures&#13;
19.1   To qualify for support from the SDF prior approval of the SDF Secretariat is required.&#13;
Applications must be submitted in accordance with the following guidelines:&#13;
a.    Applications must be submitted three months before the program is&#13;
scheduled to begin;&#13;
b.    Applications must be complete;&#13;
c.    Applications must be signed by appropriate company officials;&#13;
d.     Companies needing guidance in submitting a training proposal may contact the SDF&#13;
Secretariat for assistance.&#13;
20.   Claims for Training Grants&#13;
20.1   Training grants are reimbursed upon completion of approved training programs.&#13;
Companies should submit claims for reimbursement on the appropriate forms not later&#13;
than two months after the completion of the program.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
FINANCING OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
1.     In 1995, the Government contributed about YR70 million against the total government&#13;
spending on education and training amounting to YR7 billion. At present, the operating expenditures&#13;
of VTCs are exclusively funded through allocations from the government budget. These allocations&#13;
cover teacher/instructor salaries and student subsidies; the latter include stipends of YR150-250 per&#13;
month and the costs for boarding and meals. Few funds are available for other items such as training&#13;
materials, maintenance or curriculum development. Past investment expenditures have also been&#13;
financed by the Government, with contributions from foreign donors; main donor support represents a&#13;
long association with Germany, and more recently assistance from the Netherlands and OPEC Fund.&#13;
I&#13;
2.    In a climate of rapidly growing government deficits, the heavy dependence on budgetary&#13;
allocations is causing severe financial constraints for the VTCs. To overcome these constraints and to&#13;
establish a sustainable resource base for the VT system, new sources of finance will have to be&#13;
developed, relying primarily on the beneficiaries of vocational training, i.e., employers and students.&#13;
3.    The proposed project recommends the establishment of a Skill Development Fund (SDF) as&#13;
principle instrument to mobilize additional funds for vocational training. Other resources would come&#13;
from tuition fees, voluntary contributions by the private sector, and income generated by VTCs from&#13;
selling goods and services in local markets. Student subsidies would be replaced by scholarship&#13;
provisions for needy students.&#13;
4.     The SDF would receive its resources from a work permit fee charged to foreign employees&#13;
(YR5,000 a year), and a training levy paid by local firms (one percent of the wage bill). The bulk of&#13;
these resources would come from the private sector. A one-time contribution by the Government and&#13;
IDA, to be agreed upon during negotiations, would jump-start the program. The SDF would be fully&#13;
operational in about two years. As more firms join, its revenue would expand.&#13;
5.    Part of the Funds's resources would be transferred to VTCs to cover expenses for training&#13;
materials, maintenance of equipment and workshop facilities, curriculum development, retraining of&#13;
teachers, and short-term employment of specialized instructors from industry and business. The total&#13;
of such transfers should not exceed 30 percent of government expenditure for teacher salaries. All&#13;
other resources of the SDF can be claimed by participating firms (mostly private ones) for inservice&#13;
training or by private training providers, including future private VTCs. As the SDF raises more&#13;
funds, the share of transfers to government-owned VTCs will decline, while allocations for private&#13;
sector training will grow rapidly. The following table illustrates the expected flow of funds for the&#13;
years 1996-2000.&#13;

6.      Public VTCs would continue to receive budgetary support from the Government for teacher&#13;
salaries, student subsidies in the form of stipends, and maintenance of building and equipment. As&#13;
non-government resources become available the share of government financing is expected to decline&#13;
from 100 percent is 1995 to less than 65 percent by the year 2000. As mentioned above, allocations&#13;
from the SDF will be restricted to 30 percent of government expenditure for teachers salaries. Other&#13;
sources of finance (see para. 3 above), however, will make up for the shortfall and permit a&#13;
substantial increase in non-government financed expenditures (para. 5). The changing pattern of&#13;
financing public sector VTCs is shown in Table 2 below.&#13;

SUB-PROJECT TITLE    Skill Development Fund&#13;
TIME-FRAME    October 1996 - October 1997&#13;
RATIONALE    * Present low level of funding of VTCs has led to low quality training;&#13;
* The VTS has a very narrow financing base; there is no cost recovery in VTCs and&#13;
students receive relatively generous subsidies;&#13;
* There are no employer and community contributions to the VTS;&#13;
* Employee training is necessary to raise productivity and competitiveness of&#13;
enterprises and the training system needs to become more responsive to changing&#13;
labor market needs.&#13;
OBJECTIVES    * To mobilize significantly more resources for both pre-employment and employee training;&#13;
* To reorient financing of training from government to private sources.&#13;
OUTCOMES    * Increased financial resources to assure the financial stability of VTS and improved&#13;
quality of training;&#13;
* Financing reoriented from government to private sources;&#13;
* A VTS that is more responsive to changing labor market needs.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL    * A Skill Development Fund (SDF) Council, with majority employer representation and&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS    independent of the Government, would be organized to manage the SDF; an executive directorate&#13;
would be created to manage the day-to-day operation.&#13;

EVALUATION    guidelines and to monitor salient activities. The SDF will be subject to biennial reviews involving&#13;
the Government, IDA and GAVTT once it is established.&#13;
BENEFITS    * Funding for vocational training will be stabilized; more employers will be involved with training&#13;
and the quality of training will be improved.&#13;
RISKS    * Fund fails to materialize as expected due to lack of participation from employers invited to serve&#13;
on the governing board. This risk would be mitigated through appropriate legislations.&#13;
* Employers fail to use SDF training allocation because of lack of information; to be mitigated&#13;
through information campaign and through newsletter.&#13;

SUB-PROJECT TITLE   Curriculum Development including Trainee Assessment and Instructional material development&#13;
TIME-FRAME   June 1996 - September 2000&#13;
RATIONALE   * Curricula are not relevant to the present skill requirements in Business &amp; Industry.&#13;
* Demand for employment is met by recruiting foreign workers.&#13;
* Due to non-involvement of user systems and non-adoption of scientific models for Curriculum&#13;
review, curricula are static.&#13;
* The absence of performance standards and vaiying procedures for skills testing have&#13;
contributed to wide variations in graduation rates between trades and VTCs.&#13;
* Trainers and trainees lack instructional materials.&#13;
* Very little expertise at VTCs or at central level to develop and sustain a dynamic and&#13;
responsive system of curriculum development.&#13;
OBJECTIVES   * To institutionalize a dynamic system of curriculum development, responsive to the needs of&#13;
Yemeni business &amp; industry;&#13;
* To develop performance standards and skills testing procedures and mechanisms for&#13;
continuously improving the reliability and validity of test procedures; and&#13;
* To develop instructional materials, including AV material, relevant to the needs of trainees&#13;
and trainers, ensuring their availability to all teachers and students.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * Existing 14 programs and 8 new programs developed to suit the needs of user&#13;
systems, with provision for special local needs through VTC based curriculum&#13;
development for a portion (20 to 30 percent) of the curricula.&#13;
* Curriculum development and periodic curriculum renewal capabilities developed at the&#13;
National, (Regional) and VTC levels.&#13;
* Performance standards and skills tests developed for all existing and new programs.&#13;
* Capability to develop, administer and review tests developed within GAVTT (national)&#13;
and at VTC levels.&#13;
* Instructional materials (print &amp; audiovisual) for use by trainers and trainees&#13;
developed, field tested and made available to trainers and trainees, for all programs.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL   * GAVTT would identify three professionals interested and willing to contribute to the&#13;

SUB-PROJECT TITLE   In-service training of Trainers&#13;
TIME-FRAME  October 1996 - December 2002&#13;
RATIONALE  * VTC theory teachers and practical instructors have very little practical experience or&#13;
training.&#13;
* Lack of in-service training and development opportunities in the VT system.&#13;
* Trainee-trainer ratio is about 9 for industrial VTCs and 16 for commercial VTCs; there are&#13;
surplus trainers in some VTCs (Refer Background Table C, Annex 21).&#13;
* Most trainers lack competence in instructional techniques; theory teachers lack&#13;
practical skills and instructors lack knowledge of relevant theory and have little&#13;
exposure to Industrial situations.&#13;
OBJECTIVE  * To establish a system of In-service development for Vocational Trainers.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * All trainers in VTCs acquire pedagogical expertise through facilities available in the country, in&#13;
NIVIT supported by the German Government.&#13;
* All trainers acquire skills in their respective trades, both conventional and modern/&#13;
advanced areas, in Trainer Development Centers (TDCs) in three identified VTCs, using&#13;
Competency-based modular approach.&#13;
* All trainers acquire industrial experience through practical experience in nearby&#13;
industries; training organized by TDCs/concerned VTC and jointly supervised by GAVTT and&#13;
Industry personnel.&#13;
* Nine selected trainers trained to be trainers of trainers, in identified foreign institutions, in skill&#13;
development, using competency-based approaches.&#13;
* The three VTCs having TDCs, provided with 2 additional classrooms each and required AV&#13;
equipment. One vehicle (van) provided to each of the VTCs having TDCs.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL  * GAVTT would coordinate with German Technical Agency -- GTZ, placements for in-service&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS  training in NIVIT, for industrial internships and overseas training of trainers. GAVTT would&#13;
determine the organization and coordination of activities of the three TDCs.&#13;

EVALUATION  activities and programs. e.g. number of trainers trained, their performance on-the-job;&#13;
number of industrial internships and the quality of training in industry.&#13;
BENEFTIS   * Improved quality of instruction and therefore the quality of trained trainers would&#13;
improve.&#13;
RISKS   * VTCs may not provide facilities and resources required for applying competencies&#13;
gained through training.&#13;
SUSTAINABIL1TY  * Continuation of in-service training and follow-up will contribute to sustainability.&#13;

SUB-PROJECTTITLE   Developing a System of Continuing Education&#13;
TIME-FRAME  September 1996 - March 2000 and continuing&#13;
RATIONALE  * Except in the few companies which have their own training centers providing in-&#13;
service training to their personnel, by and large, business &amp; industry do not have&#13;
facilities to retrain or upgrade skills of their workers. Consequently, Yemeni workers&#13;
stagnate and foreign workers with relevant and updated skills are recruited to the&#13;
workforce.&#13;
* VTC graduates have no opportunities to update their skills.&#13;
* VTCs could optimize the utilization of resources (equipment &amp; machinery) by&#13;
offering Continuing Education programs designed to meet the specific needs of&#13;
personnel in business and industry. The Skill Development Fund established through&#13;
the project would fund such programs for the mutual benefit of Industry and the&#13;
VTCs.&#13;
* Teachers and instructors can also upgrade their skills in new technologies.&#13;
OBJECTIVES  * To develop a system of Continuing Education for the benefit of employees of&#13;
business and industry, trainers, and graduates of VTCs.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * Each VTC would have one of its trainers functioning as a Continuing Education&#13;
Manager (CEM), within the VTC, organizing tailor-made programs for retraining,&#13;
upgradation of skills of employees of business &amp; industry; generating income for the VTC.&#13;
* VTC Trainers would upgrade their skills through joint programs organized,&#13;
cooperatively by VTCs and Industry.&#13;
* The person responsible for Continuing Education in GAVTT and CEMs of VTCs&#13;
would acquire expertise in Curriculum Development for CE programs, course design and&#13;
marketing of programs.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL  * GAVTT would identify one professional responsible for promoting Continuing&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS   Education programs in the VTCs and arrange for his training (foreign), as well as for the&#13;
training of CEMs of VTCs. GAVTT would facilitate and monitor the organization of CE&#13;
programs by the VTCs.&#13;

SUB-PROJECT TITLE   Establishing an Area Hi-Tech Training Center'&#13;
TIMiE-FRAME  October 1996 - May 1998&#13;
RATIONALE  * Yemeni Industry is introducing High Technology in operations; there are no&#13;
training courses/facilities to upgrade skills of existing personnel in the use of Hi-Tech&#13;
equipment and machinery. Expatriate workers with skills in hi-tech are therefore&#13;
recruited.&#13;
* VTC instructors have no access to skill development programs in Hi-Tech to meet&#13;
their Continuing Education (CE) needs.&#13;
OBJECTIVES  * To establish a Hi-Tech Training Center, which would cater to the Continuing Education needs&#13;
of personnel working in Industry and for Trainers in VTCs, based on a feasibility study.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * A Hi-Tech Training Center, operating on cost-recovery basis, established with a&#13;
capacity to train 20 persons at a time, through day-release, block release and short-&#13;
term programs for skill development and maintenance of hi-tech equipment.&#13;
* 6 Master trainers trained in the hi-tech areas (mentioned above) and relevant instructional&#13;
technology through foreign fellowships.&#13;
* Director and Deputy Director of the Center trained in Continuing Education&#13;
Management with skills for needs-assessment, program design, marketing and course&#13;
pricing.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL  The Center would be autonomous with a Board of Management. A Chairman would be&#13;
nominated by the Government. The Board would have representation from government, and&#13;
industry/employers intending to modernize and introduce hi-tech/ or have already introduced hi-&#13;
tech in their operations. The Board will start functioning from the detailed planning stage. The&#13;
PIU will execute the Project operations.&#13;

SUB-PROJECTTITLE   Strengthening Selected VTCs&#13;
TIME-FRAME   October 1996 - September 1998&#13;
RATIONALE  * Programs in conventional trades are unevenly distributed amongst the VTCs, with no&#13;
relevance to the needs of geographical areas.&#13;
* There is a dire need to offer new programs to cater unmet needs.&#13;
* Most training equipment in the Industrial VTCs are out-dated and not in operation,&#13;
having depreciated/outlived their normal life-span.&#13;
* Absence of maintenance budgets and facilities have aggravated the problem.&#13;
* Most buildings are in a poor state and require extensive renovations.&#13;
* Deficiencies have been aggravated by the damages caused during the recent war.&#13;
Note: Private and public sector training centers offering in-service training, and&#13;
Agriculture and Health VICs being supported by other government departments are&#13;
excluded from the sub-component.&#13;
OBJECTIVE   * To strengthen selected VTCs for improving access and relevance to the manpower&#13;
needs of Business and Industry through strengthening physical facilities and creating&#13;
additional facilities for new programs to be offered.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * Existing programs, presently operating only in some VTCs restructured to improve&#13;
relevance, and offered in some other VTCs, thereby creating 500 new training slots.&#13;
* 8 new programs offered in VTCs, selected on the basis of local needs, creating 500&#13;
new slots to improve access.&#13;
* Existing buildings renovated and additions made as necessary in 15 VTCs for 4500 training slots.&#13;
* Equipment including AV instructional equipment provided per standard requirements.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL   * The PIU will undertake the procurement of equipment and construction of buildings per standard&#13;

SUB-PROJECT TITLE   Rehabilitation of the Physically Disabled through Vocational Training&#13;
TIME-FRAME   January 1997 - December 2002&#13;
RATIONALE   * Government policy envisages social and economic reintegration of disabled persons&#13;
through provision of effective vocational rehabilitation services and creation of&#13;
employment opportunities; at present there are about 19 VTCs for the handicapped.&#13;
* Implementation of government policy requires enormous resources.&#13;
* VT for handicapped in separate organizations segregates the disabled from&#13;
mainstream work force; community-based rehabilitation integrates the disabled into&#13;
normal, productive and purposeful lives in respective communities.&#13;
OBJECTIVE   * To support sub-projects formulated by governmental/non-governmental voluntary&#13;
agencies for VT and rehabilitation of the physically handicapped on the basis of explicit&#13;
criteria.&#13;
OUTCOMES   * Increase in the number of vocationally trained physically handicapped persons,&#13;
integrated into the community.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL   * A sub-project management committee would be responsible for inviting&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS   proposals, evaluating proposals, approving sub-projects and facilitating development of sub-&#13;

SUB-PROJECT SUMMARY NO. B.7&#13;
COMPONENT             Selective Expansion&#13;
SUB-PROJECT TITLE New Pilot Vocational Training Centers -- Two&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
Rationale&#13;
Available training facilities are concentrated in 4 govemorates. Some 14 regions/&#13;
govemorates in the country lack training centers. The issue is one of access to training, and lack of support&#13;
would reflect lact of government support for regional development. Furthermore, in terms of gender equity&#13;
there is a pressing need to expand the system. Certain governorates have no training centers for over a one&#13;
hundred mile radius. Students are poor and cannot afford to travel to those govemorates which do have training&#13;
centers. There is demand for skilled Yemeni workers, and currently the training system would be too small&#13;
number to meet the demand.&#13;
There is increased investment activity in the petroleum and natural gas sectors. This has&#13;
given rise to demand for skilled workers. Foreign investors in these sectors tend to bring their own skilled&#13;
labor to work in these industries. Increased economic activity in these sectors has given rise to demand for&#13;
skilled labor in ancilliary industries. The Government must step up its efforts to respond to the inccreased&#13;
demand which cannot be handled by the current system. Limited expansion should be supported in those&#13;
govemorates that have demonstrated evidence of potential investment, economic activity, and skilled manpower&#13;
demand.&#13;
PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS&#13;
It has been agreed that two additional centers would be established as pilot vocational&#13;
training centers reflecting emerging trends in vocational training. These centers would be selected from the six&#13;
centers already appraised by IDA. The selection criteria would include: (i) evidence of demand for skilled&#13;
labor in the area served by the vocational training center; (ii) government's willingness to assume responsibility&#13;
for covering basic recurrent costs (mainly teachers' salaries and student subsidies); (iii) preference for&#13;
vocational training centers for whose establishment there might be availability of private sector contribution; (iv)&#13;
training programs designed in close cooperation with local employers ensuring that skills taught are in demand,&#13;
and according to emerging trends for vocational training i.e., cooperative programs, enterprise-based programs&#13;
and apprenticeship programs as appropriate; and (v) Local Councils for Vocational Training (LCVTs)&#13;
established for each VTC. Prior IDA approval would be obtained before final selection of the new centers.&#13;

TIME-FRAMEE          October 1996 - December 2002&#13;
RATIONALE           * Despite poor conditions of most AET centers (total -- about 42), they continue to be&#13;
popular as they are the only opportunity for many girls and women from traditional&#13;
families to become literate, acquire knowledge about home economics and training in&#13;
basic skills for income generating activities. AET is a system through which the&#13;
government can reach an important segment of society that cannot be reached otherwise.&#13;
This has major implications for improving the health, nutritional status of girls and&#13;
women and their families, and for imparting knowledge about family planning to manage&#13;
fertility.&#13;
OBJECTIVE          * To support AET centers to restructure their programs and improve their management,&#13;
to better serve community needs and to educate girls and equip them with better life&#13;
skills and to train them in income generating activities. To support the identification of&#13;
mechanisms to improve savings mobilization and access to financial services which&#13;
would facilitate the translation of newly acquired skills into income generating activities.&#13;
OUTCOMES           * New curriculum for literacy training which includes life skills (basic health, nutrition,&#13;
family planning, environment, legal, bookkeeping, functional writing and reading and&#13;
religion).&#13;
* Trained trainers on life-skill literacy programs, participatory approaches and income-&#13;
generating skills.&#13;
* General institutional strengthening of 42 centers in better management of AET&#13;
centers, increased capacity for fund raising and marketing, increased awareness of credit&#13;
alternatives.&#13;
* Reorientation of 4 centers during the first phase with improved literacy programs and&#13;
community-identified skills training programs. If found to be successful, 20 additional&#13;
centers would be reoriened in the same manner over the remaining project&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL  * PIU of MOE to coordinate project activities and to manage funds and allocate them&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS    based on proposals presented by centers, that meet agreed criteria. A technical&#13;
committee represented by a member from each of the ministries with AET centers and&#13;
one from NGOs. Approval for provision of funds to individual centers will be made by&#13;
the Higher Council based on the recommendations of the technical committee. A&#13;
female national coordinator will be appointed to work within the PIU of MOE to&#13;
coordinate project activities and chair the technical committee. An NGO with&#13;
established presence in Yemen and experienced in similar activities internationally will&#13;
be subcontracted to support the National Coordinator in managing the TA component&#13;
and monitoring the project process.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 13 of 13&#13;
BENEFITS            * Some 5,000 women will become literate in life-skills and 5,000 women will acquire income&#13;
generating skills in the course of the project. This in turn will improve their own welfare as well&#13;
as that of their familites.&#13;
RISKS           * Inability of both government and staff of AET center programs to change the top- down&#13;
welfare approach to a bottom-up community-defined approach which will enable the centers to be&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
* Inability of centers to retain trained female staff if salaries remain low -- the trained teachers&#13;
would receive a salary comparable to primary school teachers.&#13;
* Lack of access to capital which may prevent the translation of newly acquired skills into&#13;
income generating activities.&#13;
SUSTAINABILlTY    * The community-based approach would ensure community ownership, and this in turn&#13;
will ensure sustainability of the component.&#13;

The review will be based on preliminary reports prepared by the National Council for Vocational&#13;
Training (NCVT) and the Skill Development Fund (SDF) Council, covering the issues described&#13;
below. Individual sub-project progress reports and financial statements, information based on&#13;
monitoring indicators (for details refer Implementation Volume 1), IDA supervision mission aide-&#13;
memoires and other NCVT documents will be used to prepare the preliminary report. The NCVT&#13;
and SDF Council will submit the reports to IDA and the government no less than 3 months prior to&#13;
the mid-term review.&#13;
Focus of Preliminary Reports&#13;
The NCVT preliminary report will cover the following issues and questions:&#13;
(1)    Extent to which overall commitments, disbursements and counterpart funding are in&#13;
accordance with forecasts made at the time of negotiations, discussions of any&#13;
shortfall, and proposals for remedying inadequacies in procedures leading to&#13;
shortfalls.&#13;
(2)    Review of commitments, disbursements, and counterpart funding on an individual&#13;
sub-project basis.&#13;
(3)    Review of NCVT's procedures, i.e., the extent to which guidelines are being followed&#13;
and continue to be appropriate, noting examples of best practice adoptions,&#13;
achievements, and successes as a consequence. Review of governance procedures,&#13;
management and feedback mechanism. Review of adequacy of coordination among&#13;
the sub-projects.&#13;
(4)    Review of efforts at cost recovery and cost sharing in the maintenance and&#13;
consumables within vocational training centers.&#13;
(5)    Review of extent to which policy framework has facilitated a demand driven VTS and&#13;
increased provision of private training.&#13;
(6)    Review of skilled manpower demand in different regions and evaluation of the&#13;
performance of the two pilot centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 18&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
The SDF Council preliminary report will cover the following issues and questions:&#13;
(1)    Evaluation of SDF's operation -- review of SDF procedures, i.e., the extent to which&#13;
guidelines are being followed and continue to be appropriate, successes or setbacks as&#13;
a consequence. Review of contributions to VTCs and private sector training&#13;
initiatives and making adjustments for future levels of contributions, if required.&#13;
Review of SDF administration -- audited statements of accounts.&#13;
(2)    Review of commitments and disbursements from SDF for pre-employment training&#13;
and in-service training since the establishment of the Fund. In this regard, review of&#13;
extent to which government subsidies to the VTS has diminished in absolute terms.&#13;
(3)    Review of extent to which private sector participation in management and financing of&#13;
vocational training has increased since the establishment of the Fund i.e., progress to&#13;
date, and recommendations for new initiatives. Recommendations on future courses&#13;
of action to ensure employers' participation in the provision of pre-employment and&#13;
in-service training.&#13;
(4)    Assessment of extent to which the Fund has contributed to the objectives for which it&#13;
was created and its contribution to quality improvement of the VTS.&#13;
In addition to the two preliminary reports to be prepared by the NCVT and the SDF Council, the&#13;
Project Development and Monitoring Agency (PDMA) of the Intermediary established under the&#13;
Education Sector Investment Project will submit a preliminary report on the progress made during the&#13;
pilot phase of the Adult Education and Training (AET) component.&#13;
Results of the Review&#13;
On the basis of the review, the government shall:&#13;
(a)    adopt improved operational guidelines for the NCVT and SDF Council respectively,&#13;
as appropriate;&#13;
(b)   revise sub-project objectives and strategies as appropriate; and&#13;
(c)   reallocate funds across sub-projects as appropriate to enhance the impact of sub-&#13;
projects.&#13;
During the mid-term review, IDA and the government will focus on identifying existing&#13;
problems in the overall governance of the vocational training system and of the effects of government&#13;
policies on the training sector in Yemen. A discussion of the results of policies and programs to be&#13;
implemented on the basis of the review will be furnished and a joint work program for the remaining&#13;
implementation years of the project will be finalized with the NCVT and SDF Council. The project&#13;
would then be modified on the basis of the findings and recommendations of the mid-term review.&#13;
The need for further expansion of the system will be considered based on demand for skilled&#13;
manpower, and appropriate financing options will be explored.&#13;

VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
Impact assessment aims at determining the extent to which a project would continue to&#13;
produce an acceptable flow of net benefits beyond project completion date. The assessment involves&#13;
categorizing a number of sustainability indicators based on the flow of project benefits after project&#13;
completion, to measure over tine the post-completion levels of inputs, outputs, efficiency, quality and&#13;
spin-off effects. (Refer OED Report No.9225, Pages iii, 49 &amp; 50)&#13;
In order to assess the extent of flow of project benefits beyond project completion, baseline&#13;
data at the start of the project or from a later date (as may be applicable and practicable) and the&#13;
progress in the flow of benefits after the baseline date would be required. The post-project trends in&#13;
flow of project benefits would be compared with trends during the project. Sustained flow of benefits&#13;
at levels commensurate with the socio-economic context of the country would indicate positive&#13;
impact.&#13;
Impact assessment of the Vocational Training Project would be conducted in the context of the&#13;
three major objectives of the project: (i) strengthening vocational training system (VTS) management&#13;
by providing a major role to employers in policy-making, management and financing of the VT&#13;
system; (ii) improving the quality and relevance of VT programs; and (iii) reorientation through&#13;
participation of communities, of adult education and training programs for women to improve their&#13;
relevance.&#13;
The General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT) would undertake the&#13;
responsibility of gathering data from the vocational training centers (VTCs), the Skill Development&#13;
Fund (SDF), the Local Councils for Vocational Training (LCVTs) and Local Training Program&#13;
Advisory Councils (LTPACs) with regard to each impact indicator. Data gathering would commence&#13;
from 1996, the year of project commencement or likely date from which the benefits with regard to&#13;
the indicator could be anticipated and would continue to be gathered annually. Data processing and&#13;
analysis would be undertaken by GAVTT with assistance from the management information system&#13;
(MIS), from the time the latter becomes operational.&#13;
A list of indicators giving the expected breakdown for data collection with regard to each&#13;
indicator is given on the following page. Baseline data would be established during the first year of&#13;
the project and tracer studies would be initiated as soon as new curricula have been implemented.&#13;

ANNEX 20&#13;
Page I of 3&#13;
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT&#13;
RISK ANALYSIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
1.    Recent IDA projects in Yemen have experienced substantial implementation problems, some of them&#13;
project specific, others of a more generic nature. The relevance of generic issues is shown in the attached Table&#13;
2; they include administrative inefficiency of borrower agencies, unrealistic exchange rates affecting&#13;
procurement of civil works, and difficulties in site acquisition. To minimize these implementation risks,&#13;
including the project specific ones relating to sector policy reforms, special provisions have been made in the&#13;
design and implementation plan of the proposed project. These provisions include:&#13;
(a)    The participatory design which reinforces the borrower's ownership of the&#13;
project.&#13;
(b)    A firm government commitment to policy reforms reflected in the Sector&#13;
Development Policy Statement (Annex 1).&#13;
(c)    Legal action already taken to implement policy reforms: decrees were reviewed&#13;
during appraisal and have been issued before negotiations by the Minister of&#13;
MSSL on (i) setting up a new governance structure for vocational training&#13;
(Annex 6); and (ii) establishing a Skill Development Fund (Annex 7).&#13;
(d)    Carefully prepared technical assistance packages designed to strengthen the&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), support the reorganization of GAVTT, and&#13;
train local VTC managers (Annex 15).&#13;
(e)    Agreement with the borrower to pay local contractors in US dollars which can&#13;
be exchanged in the open market at realistic rates.&#13;
(f)    The fact that few new sites would have to be acquired.&#13;
(g)    A detailed supervision plan (Annex 17).&#13;
2     Support for project implementation will also be given by the newly established resident mission in&#13;
Sana'a.&#13;
3.    With the closing of four projects in the last three years, at present, the education portfolio consists of&#13;
three projects only -- 1-3 years old. The total credit amount for these projects is US$72 million out of which&#13;
some US$28 million have already been committed for disbursements in about two years. Inspite of the&#13;
persistence of generic implementation problems, the education portfolio would show marked improvements in&#13;
the coming years. One 'U' rated credit has already closed and the other should now move to 'S' because of&#13;
improvement in its implementation.&#13;
4.    Civil works could be singled out as the most important factor for poor performance of the education&#13;
portfolio during the last five years and key reasons were: (i) change in sites requiring redesign of buildings&#13;
(Crs. 1470, 1645 ): Remedy there would be no new sites in the proposed project; (ii) delays in contract award&#13;
even after IDA reviews (Crs. 1645, 1773): Remedy - this is a key focus of FY95 CPPR and some solutions are&#13;
expected; and lastly, the most important reason (iii) severe slide in US$- YR market exchange rates made it&#13;
difficult for the civil works contractors to complete YR - denominated contracts (Crs. 1340, 1470, 1645, &amp;&#13;
1773): Remedy - all contracts would be denominated in US dollars, all new US$ contracts are doing well.&#13;

ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT&#13;
1.    The project would generate significant economic benefits on a sustained basis. The US$ value&#13;
of such benefits has been estimated in constant 1995 prices, using the average market rate of&#13;
$1 =YR120. Deducting from these benefits the estimated costs of the project (capital expenditures,&#13;
incremental recurrent cost and opportunity cost of trainees) a stream of net benefits was projected for a&#13;
period of 20 years. The estimated net benefits formed the basis for calculating internal rates of return&#13;
(IRR) for the two main project components: (a) vocational training in VTCs and enterprises; and (b)&#13;
adult education and training for women.&#13;
A.    VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
a.     The following assumptions have been used to estimate the IRR:&#13;
(i)    The capital expenditures are US$52.9 million, i.e. the total investment cost of this&#13;
component, to be disbursed over 8 years.&#13;
(ii)   Incremental recurrent costs are derived from Annex 8, tables 1 and 2. They would rise&#13;
gradually as the project is implemented, leveling off a US$1.6 million after 2003.&#13;
(iii)   The graduate output has been assumed at the eventual planned capacity of 3200 p.a. in&#13;
the public sector VTCs and at 1000 graduates through enterprise-based training&#13;
programs.&#13;
(iv)   Opportunity costs of trainees reflect average annual earnings of US$560 and&#13;
unemployment rate of 30%.&#13;
(v)    Gross benefits, the estimated earnings of trainees after graduation, are assumed as&#13;
US$840 and would increase by 3.5% over time reflecting productivity gains supported&#13;
by continuing education sub-component of the project. As the project would be&#13;
demand driven, graduates would have no difficulties finding employment in modern&#13;
manufacturing and service industries. Some graduates would also start small&#13;
businesses, mainly in service sectors. An employment rate of 90 percent for VTC&#13;
graduates and 95 percent for enterprise based training graduates has been assumed.&#13;
b.     Additional benefits not included in these estimates would be generated from training of the&#13;
handicapped and literacy and health education of women.&#13;
B.    AET FOR FEMALES&#13;
Capital expenditures for this component would be US$6.9 million. Incremental annual&#13;
recurrent cost would be relatively low -- US$0. 17million. The opportunity cost have been estimated at&#13;
US$50 p.a. while gross benefits after training would be US$200 p.a.&#13;
2.     Based on these assumptions, the IRR would be about 16%.&#13;
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
3.     To account for possible risks in generating benefits, two variables (employment rate and wages&#13;
of graduates) were found to have a major effect on the IRR; the sensitivity analysis done for these&#13;
variables (without changing other assumptions) for the range described below is shown in the attached&#13;
graphs:&#13;
a.    The employment rate of VTC graduates may go down below 90% ; its effect on IRR is shown&#13;
in the Graph 1 for an employment rate between 60-90%; an employment rate of 60% is,&#13;
however, highly unlikely as the project is demand driven.&#13;

b.                The salary of VTC graduates may fall short of the assuined value of US$840; its effect on the&#13;
IRR is reflected in Graph 2 for a salary range Of US$640 - 940.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Vocational Training Project will
            help strengthen Yemen's capacity to train skilled labor
            in line with current and emerging demand in the economy.
            This project has three objectives: 1) strengthening
            vocational training system (VTS) management by providing a
            major role to the private sector in policy-making,
            management and financing of the VTS; 2) improving the
            quality and relevance of vocational training (VT) through
            the enhancement of programs in existing centers and
            selective expansion (two new VTCs) of two pilot centers; and
            3) reorientation, through participation of communities, of
            adult education and training programs for women to improve
            their relevance. The components of the project are the
            following: 1) management and financing of VT, which includes
            institutional strengthening of the General Authority for
            Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT), management of
            vocational training centers (VTCs), management information
            system for VTCs and skill development fund; 2) quality
            improvement including five sub-components: (a) strengthening
            institutional capacity for curriculum development including
            trainee assessment and instructional material development;
            (b) in-service training of trainers; (c) developing a system
            of continuous education for employees of business and
            industry; (d) strengthening selected VTCs; and (e)
            strengthening programs for rehabilitating the physically
            handicapped through vocational training; 3) selective
            expansion (two new VTCs); and 4) adult education and
            training for females consisting of institutional development
            of adult education and training (AET) centers to design
            programs based on participatory approaches, establishment of
            an AET project funding facility to support programs which
            meet agreed criteria and refinement of existing practices in
            marketing and access to credit alternatives.
