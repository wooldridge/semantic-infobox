                          In Niger, where only a fifth of the population is literate and poverty is rife, radio has taken on an&#13;
                          extraordinarily important role in the lives of its citizens. Radio programs are not only the means through&#13;
                          which people entertain themselves and get the daily news, they are also playing a proxy role for the&#13;
                          health clinics, schools, social support networks, and continuing education needed for economic progress.&#13;
                          Women debate their role in society; citizens call in to complain about poor local services; radio report-&#13;
                          ers, microphones in hand, chase down politicians and demand answers on the air. Although Niger has a&#13;
                          long way to go in creating a viable and free media market, radio has nevertheless flourished in a remark-&#13;
                          able way in this landlocked francophone country of 13 million and given people a taste of democracy.&#13;
                          Providing the citizens of Niger with perspectives from around the world, radio is a major instrument in&#13;

            The FM revolution in Niger : radio's
            impact on capacity development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Niger, where only a fifth of the
            population is literate and poverty is rife, radio has taken
            on an extraordinarily important role in the lives of its
            citizens. Radio programs are not only the means through
            which people entertain themselves and get the daily news,
            they are also playing a proxy role for the health clinics,
            schools, social support networks, and continuing education
            needed for economic progress. Women debate their role in
            society; citizens call in to complain about poor local
            services; radio reporters, microphones in hand, chase down
            politicians and demand answers on the air. Although Niger
            has a long way to go in creating a viable and free media
            market, radio has nevertheless flourished in a remarkable
            way in this landlocked francophone country of 13 million and
            given people a taste of democracy. Providing the citizens of
            Niger with perspectives from around the world, radio is a
            major instrument in the process of capacity development in
            the country.
