Chapter I&#13;
The Energy Sector&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.1        Viet Nam began the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy in 1986, at&#13;
the Sixth Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party. This process was accelerated in 1989 with the&#13;
devaluation of the Dong and the decontrolling of most prices. In 1993, Viet Nam obtained access to&#13;
concessional international finance, while the US embargo was lifted in early 1994. All these events&#13;
provided a stimulus to the economy, which responded with a rapid growth of about 8% per annum&#13;
(p.a.) over 1992-1994. GDP is forecast to continue growing at this rate for the rest of the decade. In&#13;
the economy's continued transition and growth, the energy sector, which provides approximately one&#13;
third of the nation's foreign exchange earnings, will play a vital role.  Viet Nam's economic&#13;
development will be closely linked to growth in energy supplies in general, and electricity in particular.&#13;
1.2        Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Viet Nam, at around 113 kilograms of oil&#13;
equivalent (kgoe), is amongst the lowest in the world. In comparison, per capita consumption is 215&#13;
kgoe in the Philippines and 325 kgoe in Thailand. Biomass and fuelwood still account for about 60%&#13;
of total primary energy consumption. Petroleum products made up 44% of primary commercial energy&#13;
consumed in 1992, with coal (26%) and hydropower (30%) making up the balance. Commercial&#13;
energy consumption has grown relatively slowly over the last decade, at 2.5% p.a.. However, over&#13;
this period there has been a major shift in its composition, with a decline in the consumption of coal&#13;
and an increase in the consumption of electricity (10% p.a.) and petroleum products (9.5% p.a.).&#13;
1.3        There are substantial regional differences in the country's energy endowments and the&#13;
pattern of energy consumption. The north has an excess of hydro and coal-fired power resources, and&#13;
surplus power is now being exported to the center and the south over a recently constructed 500 kV&#13;
transmission line. This has to some extent eased the electricity shortages that these two regions had&#13;
been suffering during recent dry seasons.  The south, however, is geographically closer to the&#13;
hydrocarbon resources that have so far been discovered, and has had a more reliable supply of&#13;
petroleum products.&#13;
B. Domestic Energy Endowments&#13;
1.4        Viet Nam has considerable indigenous primary energy potential, in the form of oil, gas,&#13;
coal and hydro. These could not only meet projected national demand, but also allow additional exports&#13;
of oil and coal. Viet Nam's energy potential is, however, largely unexplored and under-exploited.&#13;
The Oil and Gas Sector&#13;
1.5        Viet Nam's hydrocarbon potential is estimated to be in the order of 4,000 - 6,000 million&#13;
barrels (mmnb). Proven and probable reserves are currently estimated at around 1,000 mmb of oil and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
3.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, of which 2.3 tcf is associated gas. However, recent discoveries and&#13;
further drilling in known fields make it likely that these estimates would be revised.&#13;
1.6        By 1992, three offshore oil fields had been discovered - Bach Ho, Rong and Dai Hung.&#13;
Production at the Bach Ho field, operated by VietSovPetro. is currently 110,000 barrels per day (bpd),&#13;
with potential reserves estimated at over 800 mmb. The Dai Hung field, operated by a consortium lead&#13;
by BHP Petroleum of Australia, began production in October 1994, at about 25,000 bpd. The Rong&#13;
field contains an estimated 30-40 nmmb, but is not yet being exploited commercially. A subsidiary of&#13;
the Mitsubishi Oil Company has recently discovered a significant reservoir of oil to the north of Bach&#13;
Ho in the Rang Dong field. Preliminary drilling suggests that this field could be as large as, or even&#13;
larger than Bach Ho.&#13;
1.7        Offshore gas development is linked to oil production; no free gas fields have been&#13;
discovered. Based on production forecasts, Bach Ho alone is not expected to be able to sustain a stable&#13;
gas supply for 15-20 years of the size required by downstream users, and will have to be supplemented&#13;
with production from Dai Hung. A gas pipeline from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria power plant is scheduled&#13;
for completion by mid-1995; the pipeline would be extended overland to the Thu Duc power station site&#13;
by end-1995. Based upon existing data, a gas profile of 1.8 to 2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year is&#13;
expected to be achieved around 1996/97 and maintained thereafter for some 15 years. The delineation&#13;
of identified gas reserves, such as Dai Hung, Rong and other marginal structures, needs to be expedited&#13;
for an accurate assessment of the gas supply base.&#13;
1.8        Viet Nam does not yet have an oil refinery, and the entire crude oil production is&#13;
exported, the bulk of it to Japan. Refined petroleum products are currently imported to meet demand&#13;
and are distributed by truck, rail and barge; there is currently only one pipeline for the transportation of&#13;
petroleum products, from Quang Ninh port to the Hanoi area. There are plans to construct a refinery&#13;
near Nhatrang by 1999, with a capacity of 6.5 million tons (mmt) (below national demand for oil&#13;
products at this date). The refinery is expected to be financed by a consortium composed of Total&#13;
(France), the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (Taiwan) and the China Investment and Development&#13;
Company (China).&#13;
The Coal Sector&#13;
1.9        Viet Nam's coal reserves are estimated at 2,345 mmt of anthracite, 78 mmnt of semi-&#13;
anthracite, 38 mit of coking coal, 96 mmt of thermal coal and 306 mmt of lignite. The commissioning&#13;
of the 1,920 MW Hoa Binh hydro plant in the north has led to a drop in coal demand from the power&#13;
sector, and coal mines are currently operating at around 50% capacity. This has pushed up costs of&#13;
production by 20%.&#13;
1.10       While the production costs of Viet Nam coal are low, the ocean freight rates charged from&#13;
Viet Nam ports are two to three times the freight costs of Australian coal to similar Asian and European&#13;
destinations. These high costs are due to slow loading rates and smaller ship handling capacity at&#13;
Vietnamese ports. Viet Nam exported just under a third of its total coal production of 3.6 mmt in 1992.&#13;
1.11       The export market is likely to be the key for future growth in the coal sector. The export&#13;
of anthracite and the possible export of electricity to China from coal-fired stations in the north&#13;
represent the major export markets for coal. However, the successful export of anthracite will require&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
improved port facilities. If this is done, Viet Nam could be exporting as much as 2.3 mint by 2000 and&#13;
3.6 mint by 2010.&#13;
Hydroelectric Resources&#13;
1.12       Substantial hydropower resources exist in Viet Nain, estimated to be in the region of&#13;
10,000 MW (3,000 MW in the south and 7,000 MW in the north). The Son La site in North Viet Nam&#13;
is the largest of the schemes that could be developed, with a potential of 2,400 MW - 3,600 MW. In&#13;
the Southern and Central regions there are 10 as yet undeveloped sites with an aggregate capacity of&#13;
2,400 MW, which could be developed before 2010. The largest of these is the Yali project in Central&#13;
Viet Namn (700 MW), which is under construction and scheduled to begin operation in 1999. There is&#13;
also the possibility of importing hydro power from Laos and Cambodia.&#13;
Biomass and Fuelwood&#13;
1.13       Biomass and fuelwood currently make up over 60%  of Viet Nam's primary energy&#13;
consumption. There are substantial regional variations in the type of biomass used. In the northern&#13;
rural areas, rice straws and husks represent the bulk of the fuel used, with wood representing the&#13;
remainder. In the Mekong delta in the south, wood, along with coconut shells and woody residues&#13;
make up the bulk of traditional fuels, while rice husks and straw play a minor role. The upland areas&#13;
of the north, center and south are in general still heavily wooded, although deforestation is proceeding&#13;
under pressure from clearing for agriculture, cutting for poles, logging and for fuelwood. As part of a&#13;
policy to conserve the forests, the Government has developed an Improved Cooking Stoves Program,&#13;
which would need to focus on areas currently having the greatest pressure on fuelwood resources. The&#13;
Bank, under Energy Sector Management and Assistance Program (ESMAP), is providing technical&#13;
assistance to the Energy Institute of Viet Nam (EI) to help improve the efficiency of the production and&#13;
consumption of traditional fuels. Specifically, the TA will assist El in: (i) the design of a phased,&#13;
costed commercialization plan for the program to distribute improved cookstoves; and (ii) determining&#13;
options for modernizing and improving the efficiency of the coal briquettes industry.&#13;
C. Energy Consumption&#13;
1.14       Table 1.1 presents the primary commercial energy balance for Viet Nam for 1992,&#13;
excluding traditional fuels (biomass and wood). Diesel fuel accounted for just under half of the&#13;
petroleum products consumption in 1992, with gasoline and fuel oil accounting for 23% and 24% of the&#13;
total respectively.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.15       In 1992 electricity accounted for 12%, petroleum products 57% and coal 31 % of the end-&#13;
use energy consumption. Commercial energy end-use consimption has grown at only 3 % per year over&#13;
the last decade. However, this masks two distinct phases, from 1980-1985 when petroleum products&#13;
consumption was held constant and electricity consumption increased by 8% per annum, and from 1985&#13;
onwards when there were rapid increases in the consumption of both petroleum products and electricity,&#13;
at 9% and 10% per annum respectively. Coal consumption has declined since 1987, due to a shift in&#13;
fuel consumption patterns by households and industry.&#13;
1.16       Sector-wise, industry accounts for 42%, transport 37%, household/service 16% and&#13;
agriculture 5 % of end-use commercial energy consumption. The bulk of energy used by the industrial&#13;
sector is coal, although the usage of electricity is expected to rise rapidly with the modernization of the&#13;
economy and the introduction of light industries. Around 50% of household consumption is made up of&#13;
petroleum products; this sector still consumed, in 1992, twice as much coal, in energy terms, as&#13;
electricity.&#13;
1.17       Commercial energy consumption is expected to increase rapidly if the forecast GDP&#13;
growth target in the order of 8% is realized. Over the last decade, due to the substitution of electricity&#13;
and petroleum products for coal, there has been a slow growth in commercial energy consumption,&#13;
relative to GDP growth. This situation is likely to change as the demand for electricity and petroleum&#13;
products is expected to increase sharply over the next decade. This could yield an overall commnercial&#13;
energy consumption growth at as much as 8% - 9% p. a.. The composition of consumption, in terms&#13;
of the relative importance of coal, gas, oil and electricity, will depend upon the availability and pricing&#13;
of gas. The power sector and the chernicals industry are expected to be the main consumers of gas; it&#13;
is unlikely that the household sector will account for a significant share of consumption, at least in the&#13;
near future.&#13;
D. Institutional Framework&#13;
1.18       Much of the energy sector remains under Government ownership and control.  All&#13;
authority within the sector is derived from the nation's senior Governmental and political body, the&#13;
Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. Institutional arrangements in the sector are&#13;
complex, involving several ministries and Government bodies, of which the Ministry of Energy (MOE)&#13;
is the most important. The MOE owns and controls the coal and power sectors, through 12 companies&#13;
and 3 institutes employing a staff of around 128,000. The Institute of Energy provides planning advice&#13;
to the MOE. All mining and mining rights are vested with the Government and mining is conducted by&#13;
Government companies only. Responsibility for planning, pricing and foreign investment across the&#13;
whole economy, including the energy sector, falls under the jurisdiction of three State Committees&#13;
which report to the Council of Ministers. With the continued shift towards a market economy, the role&#13;
of these committees is changing from prescriptive to market-based planning.&#13;
1.19       The Ministry of Heavy Industry (MHI) was formerly deeply involved in oil and gas&#13;
production. Petrovietnam, set up in 1989 under the MHI, managed production sharing contracts for the&#13;
exploration of hydrocarbon resources, and consists of 14 affiliate companies, including Vietgas&#13;
(responsible for developing natural gas resources) and three joint ventures, including VietSovPetro, the&#13;
Vietnamese-Russian company responsible for the exploitation of the Bach Ho field.  In 1992,&#13;
Petrovietnam was transferred directly under the Prime Minister.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
1.20       The power sector is currently divided into three distinct regional systems each managed by&#13;
a separate power company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution - Power Company&#13;
No. 1 (PCI) in the North, Power Company No. 2 (PC2) in the South and Power Company No. 3&#13;
(PC3) in the Center. In addition to the power companies, there are two Power Investigation and Design&#13;
Companies (PIDC1 and 2) which undertake detailed design and construction management of large&#13;
power sector projects, and three Power Construction Companies which undertake construction of major&#13;
power projects.&#13;
1.21       The Government is developing proposals to restructure the power sector to introduce the&#13;
flexibility and efficiency that will be needed if the rapid increase in demand is to be met. On January&#13;
1, 1995, the Government created the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number&#13;
562/TTg, dated October 10, 1994, to manage the entire power sector, with MOE, henceforth, playing&#13;
a broad policy-making and oversight role. This General Company is an independent juridical entity&#13;
with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter of EVN laying out the exact&#13;
scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it, is ye,&#13;
to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and legal&#13;
entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The existing three&#13;
power companies would be unbundled, each company becoming a distribution company, owning and&#13;
operating the transmission and distribution systems at 110 kV and lower, as well as small generating&#13;
plant, 60 MW and below. Separate distribution companies would be created for power distribution in&#13;
Hanoi and HCMC. A Generation Group would be created which would own and control all the larger&#13;
generating plant, with a Transmission Group owning and operating all transmission systems at and&#13;
above 220 kV. The PIDCs would be free to split off and operate as commercial consulting entities.&#13;
WAhile the details remain to be decided, it is encouraging that there is to be organizational separation of&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution operations.  This unbundling of the power sector entities&#13;
would make them more amenable to future corporatization and commercialization. Also, being a strong&#13;
commercially-oriented entity, EVN would be in a position to play an effective role in negotiating and&#13;
finalizing BOT contracts.&#13;
1.22       The Bank's ESMAP, through a technical study, Power Sector Reform Restructuring, is&#13;
assisting the Government in its consideration of various options for restructuring the sector under EVN&#13;
(para. 2.27). To assist the Government and EVN in making the transition from the existing power&#13;
sector structure to the new structure, IDA would provide additional technical assistance (under Japanese&#13;
Grant funding) for Power Sector Institutional Strengthening (para. 4.18). This technical assistance&#13;
would focus on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commnercial&#13;
management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under&#13;
the reformed sector structure. Separately, the ADB proposes to finance a tariff study and a study to&#13;
improve financial and accounting systems, while SIDA of Sweden is planning a managerial training&#13;
program for power sector staff (para. 2.28).&#13;
E. Energy Pricing&#13;
1.23       The Govermment's main objectives in setting energy prices are to ensure the financial&#13;
viability of the energy entities, to generate surplus funds for the sector to finance a significant part of&#13;
the investment program, to set prices at levels that discourage wasteful consumption and, via taxes, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
raise revenues for the general budget. However, in the electricity sector in particular, fixed assets are&#13;
undervalued and depreciation understated due to the lack of modem financial techniques. Therefore,&#13;
the estimated financial costs, which tariffs are due to recover, do not reflect the current or future costs&#13;
of production. The ADB-financed studies on tariffs and accounting systems in the power sector would&#13;
provide the bases for improving the sector's financial performance (para. 2.28).&#13;
1.24       Wholesale prices for petroleum products are set by the Council of Ministers based upon&#13;
the CIF cost, the exchange rate and anticipated inflation, and a 15 % import tax for gasoline.&#13;
Petrolimex, the national distribution agency, may then set retail prices within plus or minus 10% of the&#13;
official wholesale price. However, the tax on gasoline may not be collected if Petrolimex's actual&#13;
purchase costs of gasoline are sufficiently above the levels anticipated. The level of taxes on petroleum&#13;
products are low compared to neighboring countries like Thailand. Both, in the interest of revenue for&#13;
the Government and for energy conservation, there is a strong case for higher taxes on petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
1.25       Viet Nam has still to lay down prices for natural gas. The economic cost of gas is&#13;
estimated to be in the region of US$1.3 per million BTU (MMBTU); however, further studies are&#13;
required to establish the gas base, the costs for development and transport and the correct prices for this&#13;
resource in various sectors of the economy. The price of gas to the power sector is currently being&#13;
considered in the range of US$2.0 to 2.5 per MMBTU, in line with the fuel replacement value.&#13;
1.26       Export prices for coal are determined by market forces; the principal constraint facing&#13;
Vietnamese exports is the relatively high cost of freight from Vietnamese ports. Domestic prices are&#13;
largely set by market forces, subject to minimum sales prices which are set by the Coal Consumers&#13;
Association. The minimum prices are set so that the companies producing coal break even, which&#13;
means that coal is sold below full cost. Prices for coal to the power sector are determined through&#13;
negotiation between the coal producers and the power companies; in doing this, they follow guidelines&#13;
laid down by the State Committee on Planning (SCP).&#13;
1.27       Electricity tariffs were increased almost two-fold in 1992, with the average tariff reaching&#13;
about 4.5 USc/kWh (para. 2.21). In August 1994, a further tariff reform was implemented, with&#13;
higher rates for consumption above minimum  levels for residential consumers.  Currently tariffs&#13;
average just over 5 USc/kWh. Although the tariff schedule contains peak and off-peak tariffs for&#13;
energy, the absence of time-of-day metering, even for the largest consumers, means that these tariffs&#13;
cannot be implemented. The Government has indicated that it wishes to raise tariffs in a series of steps&#13;
to 7 USc/kWh by 1999. This represents the LRMC (actually, average incremental cost) of electricity&#13;
estimated in the Bank's Energy Sector Review. Allowing for modest inflation of the dollar of around&#13;
2.5% p.a. over this period, this means that by 1999 tariffs will be around 90% of LRMC, as compared&#13;
to 70% at present.&#13;
F. Energy Conservation&#13;
1.28       The operation of the centrally planned economy, with energy prices substantially below&#13;
cost, monopoly state enterprises with little incentive to increase efficiency and the absence of&#13;
competitive markets did not encourage energy efficiency. The transition of the economy to a market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
system, with competition in product markets, and pricing energy products closer to their cost will go&#13;
some way towards encouraging energy efficiency.  There is therefore considerable scope for&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of energy use in Viet Nam. The capital base of the manufacturing&#13;
industry is expected to more than double in the next decade; this will provide opportunities for&#13;
introducing energy efficiency technologies, provided the correct incentives are in place.  Energy&#13;
efficient household appliances will help to ease the burden that the rapid increase in household&#13;
electricity demand is expected to place upon the system. especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. Viet&#13;
Nam's commercial energy-GDP relationship, given its current GDP of US$16 billion and energy&#13;
consumption shown in Table 1.1, is US$2 of GDP per kgoe. In comparison, in 1992 Thailand had a&#13;
GDP of US$3.1 per kgoe and the Philippines US$2.7 per kgoe. The industrialization of the country&#13;
and the switch to commercial fuels would increase energy consumption per unit of GDP, and it is&#13;
important that conservation measures, such as Demand Side management (DSM) are introduced now to&#13;
moderate the growth in the demand for energy.&#13;
1.29       The conservation of energy and end-use efficiency improvements will need to be an&#13;
important component of Viet Nam's energy strategy. Efficiency gains can be expected to be derived&#13;
from both the supply and demand sides. In the power sector, the older thermal plants consume at least&#13;
20% more fuel per kWh of electricity produced than plants in other East Asian countries. Transmission&#13;
and distribution losses are in the range of 20% or more, around two to three times the level in the&#13;
OECD. The distribution system rehabilitation components of this project will reduce substantially the&#13;
level of losses in the cities of Ho Chi Minh, Hue and Nhatrang (paras. 4.6, 4.8, 4.10).&#13;
1.30       Although there is a growing awareness within Viet Nam of the utility of energy efficiency&#13;
measures, there has not so far been any systematic evaluation of DSM opportunities. A Demand Side&#13;
Management study for Viet Nam is being commissioned under the project, with Japanese Grant funding&#13;
(para. 4.17).&#13;
G. The Environmental Sector&#13;
1.31       In 1991, Viet Nam  adopted the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable&#13;
Development: A Framework for Action (NPESD). This provides a comprehensive framework for&#13;
establishing, over the next 10 years, the necessary policies, institutions, laws, regulations and programs&#13;
for addressing environmental issues. In the energy sector, it acknowledges that programs will be&#13;
required for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), watershed management, oil spill contingency&#13;
planning, air, water and soil pollution, and energy demand management through conservation programs&#13;
or legislation such as fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The Government is preparing a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), building on the Bank's report entitled Environmental Program and&#13;
Policy Priorities (Report No. 13200-VN), addressing issues related to land use and management,&#13;
reforestation and forest/watershed protection, wetlands, coastal and forest protection, urban and&#13;
industrial pollution and policy, institutional and regulatory issues.&#13;
1.32       Viet Nam has also begun to establish the legal and institutional framework required to&#13;
implement environmental management programs.  The Department of Environment and Natural&#13;
Resources (DENR) is the Government's main environmental arm. This department is part of the&#13;
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was established in October 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The Law on the Environment identifies key environmental management functions, but does not define&#13;
the role and responsibilities of DENR at an operational level. DENR's capacity to perform these&#13;
functions remains limited. Within the line agencies, Departments of Science and Technology have been&#13;
instructed to add environmental protection to their mandates.  Therefore, the MOE has an&#13;
environmental management role; however, in common with the other line agencies, it lacks the staff&#13;
with specialized training and experience, and does not yet have the capacity to develop and implement&#13;
sector-specific environmental guidelines.&#13;
1.33       A Law on Protection of Environment was enacted in December 1993. Amongst other&#13;
provisions it: (a) identifies in general terms the responsibilities of the state, organizations and&#13;
individuals to prevent and remedy environmental deterioration and pollution; (b) provides for the&#13;
development of environmental standards and submission of environmental impact reports on new and&#13;
existing facilities and provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;&#13;
and (c) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations. Several other legal initiatives relevant to the&#13;
energy sector have been completed or are being developed.  These include the Act of Forestry&#13;
Protection and Development (enacted by the National Assembly on August 18, 1991), a key provision&#13;
of which requires compensation if environmental disruption occurs, and designates certain areas as&#13;
protected forests for hydroelectric watersheds; and the Regulation on Environmental Protection in&#13;
Marine Petroleum Operation (enacted September 5, 1990). Waste water guidelines and regulations, and&#13;
a Mining Law are currently being enacted. However, the Law does not make clear, for exanple, who&#13;
shall be responsible for preparing the EJAs, or which institutions will have the mandate of reviewing&#13;
them.&#13;
1.34       It is likely that the next two years (1995-1996) would concentrate on the promulgation of&#13;
environmental umbrella legislation, institutional capacity building and drafting of specific regulations on&#13;
pollution and environmental management. The implementation and enforcement of selected regulations&#13;
in high priority areas will follow on from this.&#13;
1.35       In the commercial energy sector, high priority areas are watershed management (affecting&#13;
hydroelectric resources) and particulate emissions from thermal plant, and surface disruption by coal&#13;
mines. Water pollution from site-specific energy industry investments, and air pollution from sulphur&#13;
emissions and NO/VOC emissions may have a relatively low priority, yet it is expected that they will&#13;
be addressed in the 1997-2001 time horizon primarily because these problems can be handled using&#13;
relatively straightforward control technologies.&#13;
H. Energy Sector Strategy and Issues&#13;
1.36       In its wider program to reform the economy, the Government is moving from price&#13;
liberalization measures, which have so far been very successful, to more difficult institutional reforms,&#13;
such as restructuring and privatizing state-owned businesses. The Government plans to restructure the&#13;
power sector by creating an umbrella entity, i.e. the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, and&#13;
organizationally separating the core power sector operations of generation, transmission, and&#13;
distribution. This operational separation in itself represents a fairly significant step in the right&#13;
direction. While the structure will still have a single authority over the entire sector, the Government&#13;
would gradually need to sequence further reforms especially in the development of a legal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
regulatory framework that would allow for strong regulatory oversight and greater autonomy and&#13;
financial responsibility at the enterprise level. This careful pacing and sequencing of reforms is&#13;
particularly important for the power sector which has strong monopolistic characteristics. The studies&#13;
under the proposed project (para. 1.22) will not only assist the Government in making these decisions&#13;
and in implementing them but will also allow the achievement of broader objectives of introducing&#13;
market-oriented mechanisms in all sectors of the economy.&#13;
1.37        The demands placed upon the power sector by the pace of economic growth, in particular&#13;
in the cities of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, are likely to be severe. This makes the reform of the sector to&#13;
introduce efficient and flexible management essential. It will also require the mobilization of financial&#13;
resources, internally through changes in tariffs and taxes and in the longer-term externally through&#13;
foreign direct equity investment and bilateral/multilateral aid and the implementation of an integrated,&#13;
least cost development program for the energy sector. This will require that the MOE maintain its&#13;
policy making capacity to provide guidance to the sector as a whole.&#13;
1.38        As far as pricing of energy products is concerned, there are two issues which are of&#13;
importance. The level of duties and taxes on petroleum products is low compared with successful&#13;
neighboring economies such as Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. There is considerable scope for the&#13;
Government to raise additional revenue for the budget by raising duties, in particular on gasoline and&#13;
diesel fuel. This would also have the benefit of dampening the increase in demand for these products.&#13;
Secondly, the price of electricity is substantially below LRMC, and currently, most likely, below the&#13;
financial requirements of the power sector. The Government's indication that tariffs will be raised to 7&#13;
USc/kWh by 1999 is, therefore, welcome. It is important that electricity is correctly priced to send the&#13;
right messages to consumers. The introduction of metering to support time of day tariffs, at least for&#13;
the largest consumers, and the possible application of seasonal tariffs; will help to achieve this&#13;
objective.&#13;
1.39        In the coal sector, the Government agencies should move away from operations and focus&#13;
more on policy implementation, research and regulation for safety and pollution control. The success&#13;
of exports will depend upon the development of modern handling facilities at ports.&#13;
1.40        There is already extensive private sector involvement in the petroleum sector, with the&#13;
operation by foreign consortia of oil fields within Viet Nam's territorial waters, and the likelihood of&#13;
private sector financing for the refinery. The Government's role within this sector should continue to&#13;
be at a regulatory and policy-making level. As far as the development of gas resources is concerned,&#13;
the policy should be to ensure correct pricing of gas, and ensuring availability of gas to sectors where&#13;
it has the highest value; predominantly in the power sector.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter II&#13;
The Power Sector&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
2.1        Viet Nam's power sector is divided into three distinct regional systems, each managed by&#13;
a separate power company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution - Power Company&#13;
1 (PCI) in the North, PC2 in the South and PC3 in the Center. PC1, which serves the areas around&#13;
Hanoi and Hai Phong (population 34 million) has an installed capacity of about 2,000 MW and a peak&#13;
demand of about 1,000 MW. PC2, which serves Ho Chi Minh City and the lower Mekong Delta&#13;
region (population 24 million), has an installed capacity of about 1,200 MW and a peak demand of&#13;
about 800 MW. PC3, which serves the areas around Danang and Hue (population 10 million) has an&#13;
installed capacity of about 250 MW and a peak demand of about 200 MW. The available generating&#13;
capacities are well below installed capacities due to poor condition of the thermal plants.&#13;
2.2        The North has abundant coal and hydropower resources; in contrast, the South and Center&#13;
regions face acute generation deficiencies and require substantial additions of capacity over the near&#13;
future. Fuel options for power generation in the south include: (a) off-shore natural gas (until recently&#13;
being flared at a great cost to the economy); (b) coal, imported either from the North or from regional&#13;
countries; and (c) hydropower, both from the South and from the two other regions. In Central Viet&#13;
Nam, the demands are low and the region has a large hydropower potential which can be tapped for the&#13;
benefit of both the Center and the South. A 500 kV line linking the three regions has recently been&#13;
completed by the Government; this would facilitate interregional power transfers and an integrated&#13;
development of the national grid. In parallel with capacity additions, the Government has plans to&#13;
improve generation efficiency by rehabilitating existing coal and oil-fired plants and converting turbines&#13;
from open-cycle to combined-cycle operation, and from oil to gas firing.&#13;
B. The Power Market&#13;
The Growth of Electricity Demand in Viet Nam&#13;
2.3        Viet Nam has seen a very rapid growth in the demand for electricity over the last decade,&#13;
averaging 9.9% p.a. over the period 1981-1993. This is commnensurate with GDP growth of around&#13;
7% over the same period. Sales of electricity in 1993, at just over 8,000 Gwh, were treble the levels&#13;
of 1981. Growth was slowest in PC1, although it still averaged 8.2% p.a., with sales in PC2 and PC3&#13;
growing at 10.0% p.a. and 12.6% p.a., respectively. There was a slowdown in the growth of sales in&#13;
PC2 and PC3 in 1990-1992, due to chronic shortages in electricity supply; since these have eased,&#13;
growth has accelerated again.&#13;
2.4        Table 2.1 compares sales, losses, and peak demand for the three systems for 1993. For&#13;
the country as a whole, average technical losses were about 20% of generation and non-technical losses&#13;
were about 6 %.&#13;

2.5        Sectorally, industry represents the largest consumer (sales of 3,645 Gwh in 1993), with&#13;
sales to residential consumers (3,236 Gwh) comparable in size. Both agriculture (430 Gwh) and non-&#13;
industrial (696 Gwh), the latter representing transport and service industries, are still relatively small.&#13;
Sales to residential consumers grew at 13.7% p.a. over the period 1981-1993, nearly double the growth&#13;
rate of sales to industry (which grew at 7.6%).&#13;
Forecasts of Electrcity Demand&#13;
2.6        Growth in the demand for electricity in Viet Nam will be strongly driven by growth in&#13;
GDP. Following annual growth rates of GDP of 5.1 % in 1990, 6.0% in 1991, 8.6% in 1992, 8.1 % in&#13;
1993 and a preliminary estimate of 8.0% in 1994, IDA currently expects GDP growth of 8.0% per&#13;
annum to be sustainable over the period to 1997 at least. This assumes that domestic savings will reach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
a level of around 17% of GDP by this time, and that the budget deficit stays at around 4% (or less) of&#13;
GDP. Longer term growth prospects are less certain, but it is quite feasible that GDP growth through&#13;
to the year 2005 would be 7% p.a. or more.&#13;
2.7         There have been substantial regional variations in GDP growth. In 1992/93, the Red&#13;
River Delta Province, (which includes Hanoi), grew at 4.6%; in comparison, the Central Coast&#13;
Province (covering Danang, Hue and Nhatrang) grew at 6.3%, the Southeast grew at 15.4%, and the&#13;
Ho Chi Minh City area (part of Southeast province) grew at over 16%. The slowest growing area was&#13;
the Northern Uplands Province, which saw an expansion in GDP of 3.1 %. These estimates may not&#13;
accurately reflect economic growth as they do not fully take account of private sector activity. If these&#13;
trends are continued in the medium term, sales in PC2 will grow fastest, followed by PC3 and PCI.&#13;
2.8         The Energy Institute's sales forecasts for each of the power companies are presented in&#13;
Table 2.2. These represent a Base Case and a High Case scenario; the Base Case assumes an average&#13;
increase of 12.9% p.a. for the country as a whole until the year 2000, the High Case assumes an&#13;
average increase of around 14.2% p.a. over the same period. After this period, lower growth of&#13;
around 10% is assumed.&#13;

expectations of GDP growth and the real price increases for electricity that the Govermnent has stated&#13;
that it is willing to impose. Given current tariff levels, an increase in average tariffs to 7 USc/kWh by&#13;
1999 corresponds to an average annual increase of 5% over the next five years. Assuming a GDP&#13;
growth of 8% p.a., the apparent income elasticity of electricity demand would have to equal 1.5 (or&#13;
more) to generate an average annual increase in sales in excess of 12%. This is at the upper level of&#13;
what could be expected in a fast growing developing country over a short period of time. A sales&#13;
growth of 14% p.a. (as in the High Case) would most likely require a double digit growth of GDP. In&#13;
the longer run, a lower income elasticity - for example around 1.5 - might be expected to hold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
However, assuming no real price increases, a growth in sales in the range of 10% or more could be&#13;
achieved if GDP growth exceeded 7% p.a.; this is consistent with the Base Case forecasts assumption&#13;
for the longer term.&#13;
2.10       A useful check on these demand forecasts is a comparison against countries in the region&#13;
which have experienced similar rates of growth. Both Thailand and Malaysia have seen very rapid&#13;
growth in GDP and, correspondingly, in electricity consumption. In Thailand, over the period 1983 to&#13;
1993, electricity consumption increased by 12.4% p.a. compared to GDP growth of 8.6% p.a.; the&#13;
years 1988 to 1990 saw growth in consumption of as high as 15% p.a., driven by GDP growth rates in&#13;
excess of 12%. In Malaysia, the period 1965-1985 saw an increase in electricity consumption of 12%&#13;
p.a. on average. Over roughly the same period, GDP increased by 7% p.a.. This suggests that, in the&#13;
medium term, assuming GDP growth is in the region of 8% p.a., Viet Nam could expect to achieve&#13;
growth in electricity consumption of 12% p.a.; however, it is likely to be damped somewhat over the&#13;
next five years since tariffs are expected to increase significantly in real terms.&#13;
2.11       In the fastest growing parts of the economy - such as HCMC - the demand for electricity&#13;
can be expected to grow faster than that predicted for the economy as a whole. Forecasts of sales&#13;
growth for this area are in the range of 18% p.a. on average for the period 1995 to 2000. This accords&#13;
with forecast GDP growth in the region of 13% - 15% p.a..&#13;
C. Generation and Transmission Facilities&#13;
2.12       Annexes 1 and 2, respectively, provide a detailed listing of generation and transmission&#13;
facilities for each of PC2 and PC3.&#13;
Generation&#13;
2.13       Total installed generating capacity in the country is approximately 3,500 MW, of which&#13;
PCI has 2,000 MW and PC2 1,200 MW. In the northern region, the completion of the Hoa Binh&#13;
hydroelectric plant (1,920 MW and 8,400 Gwh) means that there is now substantial excess capacity; the&#13;
three large coal-fired steam generation plants in the region (Pha Lai, Nin Binh and Uong Bi) are&#13;
operating at well below 50% of their rated capacities. These plants are of Soviet and Chinese origin,&#13;
and are located near anthracite mines. All these plants are in relatively poor condition, due to the&#13;
quality of the design, dearth of spare parts, inadequate control systems and poor maintenance. Peak&#13;
demand in PCI, at 1,000 MW, is well below installed capacity, although allowance has to be made for&#13;
exports to PC2 and PC3 of around 400 MW and the low availability on some of the older thermal units.&#13;
2.14       The commissioning of the 500 kV  North-South-Center link has created a single&#13;
Vietnanese power grid and has for the time being ended the chronic energy shortages that the South&#13;
and Center had been suffering. PC2 anticipates importing 20% of its power requirements through the&#13;
link in 1994, rising to 33% in 1995. Unlike the North, the South and Center have suffered from a&#13;
deficit in generation, shortages in power being especially critical during the dry season when&#13;
hydropower energy is low. The major hydro site in this region is Tri An (400 MW); the Vinh Son (66&#13;
MW) and Thac Mo (150 MW) hydro-electric plants are to be commissioned shortly. There are two&#13;
principal fuel-oil fired thermal generating stations in the south (Thu Duc, 165 MW, and Can Tho, 33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
MW). New combustion turbines have been added to both Thu Duc (2 x 37.5 MW) and Ba Ria (5 x&#13;
37.5 MW). A gas pipeline, from the Bach Ho field, would be laid to the Ba Ria site by mid 1995 (and&#13;
will be extended to Thu Duc by early 1996), allowing these turbines to be operated on gas. Despite&#13;
these additions, there would be insufficient generating capacity to provide a firm backup to the 500 kV&#13;
link (which is single circuit) and therefore the South and Center can expect to suffer from at least&#13;
temporary power shortages when the link is inoperative.&#13;
Transmission and Distribution&#13;
2.15       Viet Nam's transmission and distribution systems are based on multifarious standards and&#13;
are old and unreliable, with losses of well over 20% (see Table 2.1). There is an urgent need to&#13;
rehabilitate and strengthen the networks to reduce technical losses, improve reliability and thereby&#13;
reduce outages, and serve the forecast increases in demand. In PC3's major urban areas such as&#13;
Danang, Hue and Nhatrang, 6 kV is the most significant distribution voltage, but in addition there are&#13;
some 15 kV and 35 kV networks; some of the 6 kV network was originally designed for operation at&#13;
3.3 kV. In HCMC two MV networks (15 kV and 6.6 kV) serve the city. The Government has decided&#13;
to standardize the distribution voltages at 0.4 kV and 20 kV for the whole country; there will be a&#13;
gradual process of upgrading the country's networks. The proposed project will help to modernize the&#13;
networks and achieve these objectives in some of the important cities of Viet Nam.&#13;
2.16       As far as EHV and HV transmission are concerned, the commissioning of the 500 kV link&#13;
(1,440 km long) represents the first step in the construction of a national grid. Prior to this, there were&#13;
two separate interconnected grids in the country, operating at 220/230 kV, 110 kV and 66 kV, with a&#13;
total circuit length of about 5,500 km. The development of a national link underscores the need for&#13;
modern national and regional dispatch centers and communications systems (para. 4.11).&#13;
D. Viet Nam's Power Development Plan&#13;
2.17       The Government's objectives for the development of the power sector are: (a) exploitation&#13;
of the vast hydropower potential of the country; (b) improvement of supply side efficiency through&#13;
reduction of losses in energy conversion, transmission and distribution; (c) promotion of foreign&#13;
investments; and (d) increasing the availability of electricity in rural areas.  In line with these&#13;
objectives, the Energy Institute has developed a generation expansion schedule, using the ENPEP&#13;
model.&#13;
2.18       Under this plan there will be a substantial addition of hydro capacity (Vinh Sohn, Song&#13;
Hinh, Yali, Dai Ninh and Pley Krong) and of gas-fired combined cycle capacity (Phu My and others).&#13;
There is also expected to be development of coal-fired capacity in the north, at Pha Lai and, later, at&#13;
Quang Ninh. A total of 2,391 MW is expected to be added by 2,000 and 5,895 MW by 2005. The&#13;
plan was developed using the Base Case demand forecast (see Table 2.2), and a planning criteria of&#13;
Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) of about 3 days per year.&#13;
2.19       Associated with this, it is expected that about 1,440 km of 220 kV lines, 2,070 km of 110&#13;
kV lines, 1,376 MVA of 220/110 kV transformer capacity and 2,235 MVA of 110 kV/MV transformer&#13;
capacity will be added to the system. Additional capacity on the 500 kV interconnector is expected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
coincide with the commissioning of the Yali project. The development of the large Son La scheme&#13;
(2,400 MW), which is planned for the period after 2005, would require a further upgrading of the link.&#13;

2.20        Table 2.4 shows forecasts of the power balance for PCI, PC2 and PC3, for selected years&#13;
(the most important dimension as far as medium term planning for the power sector is concerned). It&#13;
shows that, despite the addition of generating capacity envisaged under the plan, PC2 and PC3 would&#13;
face shortages in generating capacity, and will not have sufficient reserve to back up the 500 kV link.&#13;
The correct pricing of power at peak times may help to reduce the incidence of power shortages at&#13;
peak. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would, on an annual basis, furnish to&#13;
IDA for its review and comments: (a) a review of the implementation of its power development&#13;
program during the preceeding 12 months; and (b) its proposed implementation program for the next&#13;
five years, and thereafter carry out the power development program taking into account IDA's&#13;
comments.&#13;
E. Electricity Tariffs&#13;
2.21        Existing tariff levels are provided in Annex 3. Tariffs were rationalized and raised almost&#13;
two-fold in March 1992; higher charges during the dry season were introduced for consumption above&#13;
set levels, and special tariffs were introduced for foreigners and partially or wholly owned foreign&#13;
companies. In August 1994, tariffs were raised to an average of D530/kWh, or just over 5 USc/kWh,&#13;
from a level of approximately D450/kWh. With the easing of power shortages in the South and Center,&#13;
the higher stepped tariffs during the dry season in these regions were removed, and tariffs were&#13;
increased in overall terms. The LRMC of electricity was estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
USc/kWh and the government has expressed its commitment to increasing tariffs to this level.&#13;
Assuming relatively low levels of inflation (around 2.5%) in US$ terms, by 1999 tariffs will be&#13;
approximately 90% of LRMC, as compared to 70% at present.&#13;

2.22         Tariffs are currently uniform across Viet Nam. Industrial consumers face a tariff schedule&#13;
that has average, peak and off-peak tariffs, with peak rates being well over double the off-peak rates.&#13;
Unfortunately, few, if any, of these customers have time of day metering, and therefore this tariff&#13;
schedule cannot be applied. The introduction of these meters, for appropriate consumers, will be an&#13;
important step in establishing a cost reflective tariff that will provide incentives for conservation of&#13;
energy at peak times. The ADB is funding a tariff study to assist in the development of an appropriate&#13;
tariff policy, based on appropriate financial and social objectives (see Annex 7).&#13;
2.23         The present tariff structure broadly reflects the differences in costs associated with voltage&#13;
level and type of consumer. Therefore, charges to industrial consumers are highest for those supplied&#13;
at 6 kV or below, and lowest for those supplied at voltages above 20 kV. There is a subsidy element&#13;
in the Residential category: consumers face a rising block tariff, with the lowest block (up to 150 kWh&#13;
per month) being priced at D450/kWh, and the highest block (above 250 kWh) priced at D800/kWh.&#13;
The tariffs to  commercial customers are substantially above anything paid by other consumers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
(D900/kWh against D550/kWh for LV industrial consumers and D800/kWh for the higher-rate&#13;
residential consumers). It is likely that residential consumers will be contributing proportionately more&#13;
to the peak than commnercial consumers do, suggesting that this difference is not cost reflective. In&#13;
addition, there is a tariff schedule for foreign customers (both business and residential), with tariffs&#13;
above the estimated LRMC  of 7 USc/kWh.  The existence of "wholesale electricity vendors",&#13;
particularly in rural areas, who buy electricity from the power companies and resell it, metered through&#13;
submeters, to small customers, is quite prevalent. The prices the vendors charge are considerably&#13;
higher than the official tariffs, ranging as high as Dl,000/kWh. The number of submeters is quite&#13;
substantial and, in the case of PC3, by far higher than the total of all its customers. The high prices&#13;
charged suggest that the willingness-to-pay for electricity is well above current tariff levels.&#13;
2.24        The main reform required at present is an increase in the average rate of the tariff, to&#13;
reflect to consumers the true cost of electricity supply. To improve the accuracy of the price signals&#13;
sent through the tariffs, the Government should consider: (a) introduction of metering to allow peak and&#13;
off-peak tariffs to be charged to large consumers; (b) introduction of demand charges for larger&#13;
consumers; and (c) increasing the level of tariffs charged to residential consumers, at least for&#13;
consumption over the minimum block. so that the higher rates are at least equivalent to that charged to&#13;
comnmercial consumers. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would, on an annual&#13;
basis, furnish to IDA a review of the policy and levels of its electricity tariffs, including proposed&#13;
adjustments to meet the objectives of the power development program, and thereafter implement&#13;
proposed adjustments taking into account IDA's comments.&#13;
F. Sector Strategy&#13;
Sector Reform and Restructuring&#13;
2.25        The Government is developing proposals to restructure the power sector to introduce the&#13;
flexibility and efficiency that will be needed if the rapid increase in demand is to be met. On January&#13;
1, 1995, the Governnent created the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number&#13;
562/TTg, dated October 10, 1994, to manage the entire power sector, with MOE, henceforth, playing&#13;
a broad policy-making and oversight role. This General Company is an independent juridical entity&#13;
with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter of EVN laying out the exact&#13;
scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it, is yet&#13;
to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and legal&#13;
entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The existing three&#13;
power companies would be unbundled, each company becoming a distribution company, owning and&#13;
operating the transmission and distribution systems at 110 kV and lower, as well as small generating&#13;
plant, 60 MW and below. Separate distribution companies would be created for power distribution in&#13;
Hanoi and HCMC. A Generation Group would be created which would own and control all the larger&#13;
generating plant, with a Transmission Group owning and operating all transmission systems at and&#13;
above 220 kV.&#13;
2.26        In November 1993, the Government issued a decree on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)&#13;
contracts, designed to facilitate the introduction of this style of project into Viet Nam. The particular&#13;
emphasis was on infrastructure, including power. The regulations, amongst other aspects, seek to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
define the terms and conditions under which BOT companies can be established, the taxation that such&#13;
projects will attract, and a guarantee regarding conversion of local currency into foreign expenditure.&#13;
Several BOT proposals for power generation are currently under Government's consideration.&#13;
2.27       IDA would be assisting the Government in the identification of an appropriate long term&#13;
structure for the power sector under EVN through a Power Sector Reform and Restructuring study to&#13;
be conducted by ESMAP (para.4.3).  This technical assistance is designed to assist the Government&#13;
and EVN in making the transition from the existing power sector structure to the new structure. This&#13;
effort is based on the principles of: (a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector; (b)&#13;
commercialization and corporatization of the constituent operations to provide greater managerial and&#13;
financial autonomy; (c) developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for&#13;
greater enterprise autonomy and requisite government regulatory oversight; and (d) a financially viable&#13;
and open sector structure that allows for increased private involvement in financing sector expansion.&#13;
2.28       In addition, IDA and other donors are planning to assist the Vietnamese in institutional&#13;
strengthening of the power sector. Funds would be provided under Japanese Grant Facility to help in&#13;
power sector institutional strengthening (para. 4.19). This technical assistance would focus on the&#13;
development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commercial management practices,&#13;
budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under the reformed sector&#13;
structure. The ADB is proposing to finance a study to improve financial and accounting systems, and&#13;
a second on tariffs; SIDA of Sweden is planning a managerial training program. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that the Borrower would furnish to IDA for its review and comments: (a) the&#13;
findings of the ADB sponsored Accounting and Tariff studies; and (b) its proposals for the&#13;
implementation of the studies' recommendations, and thereafter implement said proposals taking into&#13;
account IDA's comments.&#13;
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement&#13;
2.29       There have been no previous IDA operations in the power sector in Viet Nam. However,&#13;
IDA has very recently been involved in the resettlement process in its Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
and the lessons learned from this project in regard to defining project affected persons and the legal&#13;
framework for resettlement and compensation have been drawn upon in preparing the proposed project.&#13;
Lessons from other power projects that are pertinent to this project are: (a) the need for thorough&#13;
investigations in the preparation of technologically complex components. This project is technically&#13;
straightforward in as much as the technologies of the various components are fairly straightforward and&#13;
familiar to the Vietnamese; where more complex technology is involved (load dispatch centers) adequate&#13;
foreign consulting assistance has been and will be availed of; (b) the need for care in preparing the cost&#13;
estimates; adequate contingencies have been provided in the project; and (c) the need to strengthen the&#13;
implementation capabilities of the institutions. While the concerned Vietnamese institutions are&#13;
technically capable of implementing the project documents, they need considerable assistance in&#13;
preparing bidding documents, bid evaluations and progress reports. This has been taken care of by&#13;
providing expatriate consulting assistance for assisting the Vietnamese in managing each project&#13;
component.&#13;
Rationale for IDA's Involvement&#13;
2.30       The Bank's Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review for Viet Nam (Report No.&#13;
10842-VN), has been instrumental in identifying the issues and options facing the energy sector and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
assisting the Government in developing its first least-cost power development plan. Viet Nam's need for&#13;
investment in the power sector is large. While IDA could finance only a fraction of its investment&#13;
program, its participation in the sector would help catalyze funds from other bilateral and multilateral&#13;
sources. The Government is committed to reforming state enterprises and moving from centrally&#13;
planned to market-oriented mechanisms. For the power sector, this would involve a staged process of&#13;
transition; first strengthening the existing institutions, then commercializing and corporatizing them and&#13;
subsequently introducing reforms and a regulatory framework conducive to private sector participation.&#13;
IDA's assistance in this effort would make a major contribution to an orderly development of the&#13;
sector. Finally, involvement of IDA in the early stages of development is expected to have a significant&#13;
influence on the optimum use of limited resources in fostering efficiency and conservation and an&#13;
environmentally sustainable development.&#13;
2.31       The project is consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 13545-VN,&#13;
September 26, 1994) which proposes working with the Government to continuously update its&#13;
development plan, taking account of changing economic conditions; to improve efficiency of electricity&#13;
utilization through proper pricing and conservation; and to strengthen power agencies through technical&#13;
assistance and training.&#13;
2.32       The policies and programs pursued by the Government in the power sector are in&#13;
compliance with IDA's policies and guidelines for commitment to efficiency improvement (including&#13;
demand-side management and energy conservation), sector reform and restructuring, moving towards&#13;
commercialization and corporatization, and encouraging private participation.&#13;

The Beneficiaries&#13;
A. The Beneficiaries&#13;
3.1        The beneficiaries of the proposed credit are: (a) the Ministry of Energy (MOE) for the&#13;
National Load Dispatch Center and the National Training Center; (b) Power Company No. 2 (PC2) for&#13;
HCMC distribution, the Southern Region Load Dispatch Center, the Southern Region Training Center&#13;
and the Ba Ria combined cycle project; and (c) Power Company No. 3 (PC3) for Hue and Nhatrang&#13;
distribution, the Central Region Load Dispatch Center, the Central Region Training Center, the 220kV&#13;
Krongbuk-Nhatrang line and Krongbuk and Nhatrang substatior,, and the 110 kV substations of&#13;
Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri.&#13;
B. Organization and Management&#13;
MIinisty of Energy&#13;
3.2        The Ministry of Energy (MOE) is responsible for the production, distribution and supply&#13;
of electricity and coal. The MOE discharges these responsibilities through several wholly-owned&#13;
subsidiaries (Chart 1) under its supervision: the Institutes of Mine and Energy, the PCs No. I (North),&#13;
No. 2 (South) and No. 3 (Central), the Power Investigation and Design Companies No. I (North) and&#13;
No. 2 (South), the Coal Cornpanies in Cam Pha, Hon Gai and Uong Bi, and the Power Construction&#13;
Companies Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Electricity production, distribution and supply is carried out through the&#13;
three PCs. Following the creation of EVN on January 1, 1995 (para. 1.21), all entities connected with&#13;
the power sector come under its management with MOE retaining a broad policy-making and oversight&#13;
role.&#13;
3.3        The EVN is currently engaged in drafting its charter that would lay out the exact scope of&#13;
its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it (para. 1.21).&#13;
To the extent that these organizational changes will affect the implementation responsibilities for the&#13;
proposed project, it will be necessary for the Government to define its financial and operational&#13;
objectives for the member enterprises and discuss and agree with IDA on appropriate modifications to&#13;
the legal arrangements for the project (including appropriate financial and other conditionalities), both&#13;
for ensuring satisfactory implementation of the project and for monitoring the operations of the power&#13;
sector. Agreement was reached at negotiations that any organizational changes in the power sector, in&#13;
so far as they impact on the terms and conditions of the credit, would be discussed between IDA and&#13;
the Borrower.&#13;
Power Company No. 2&#13;
3.4        Organization. PC2 was established as a juridical entity in 1976 (Annex 4) as the "Power&#13;
Company of the South", succeeding the "General Department of Power". In 1981 under Resolution&#13;
No. 15-DL/TCCB3 its name was changed to Power Company No. 2. Like all SOEs, PC2 had to re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
register under Resolution No. 388-HDBT in 1991. Resolution No 147-TTG of April 7, 1993&#13;
reestablished PC2 with a Capital of Dong 3,831,204 million and PC2 registered under Registration&#13;
Certificate No 102618, dated April 23, 1993. PC2 is wholly owned by the Government, and in many&#13;
respects has the characteristics of a government department, reporting to the Government through the&#13;
MOE. PC2 operates its own bank accounts and can borrow both local and foreign funds. Foreign&#13;
borrowing, however, requires the approval of the Government through the State Bank of Viet Nam.&#13;
3.5        PC2, headquartered in HCMC, is responsible for power generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution throughout the south of the country. Its area of 19 provinces covers Lam Dong and Thuan&#13;
Hai in the north and reaches across the Mekong delta in the south, including the province of Minh Hai.&#13;
At the end of 1993, PC2 had an installed capacity of 1,358 MW, generating 4,661 Gwh. In 1993 it&#13;
had total sales of 3,646 Gwh and served a population of 25.6 million.&#13;
3.6        The organization of PC2 is structured along functional lines and is shown in Chart 2. It is&#13;
headed by a Director General assisted by four Deputy Directors General for: production, technical&#13;
matters, construction supervision, and economics; and a Chief Accountant. The Director General, the&#13;
Deputy Directors General and all officials responsible for an "account" (management of funds), i.e. the&#13;
heads of power stations and regional offices, are appointed by MOE, while department directors at&#13;
headquarters are appointed by the Director General. While PC2's organizational structure appears to&#13;
fulfill its current operational needs, it would need to be carefully reviewed in the light of prospective&#13;
reforms in the power sector.&#13;
3.7        On the whole, PC2's management and staff are technically competent. As of 1993, it had&#13;
a total staff of 11,180 of which 1,240 comprise engineers and other university level employees, 645&#13;
middle level employees, and 5,323 technicians. The rest are lower level semi-skilled workers. With a&#13;
staffing ratio of eight employees per installed MW, the company has the same ratio as for the Thai&#13;
power sector. By the end of 1993, PC2 had a total of 736,658 customers of which 655,722 were&#13;
classified as residential, 41,330 as industrial, 4,421 as agricultural, 34,475 as commercial and 710 as&#13;
"transport customers" (airports, etc.). In addition, there were a considerable number of sub-consumers.&#13;
PC2 has about 65 customers per staff which is low, when compared to a figure of about 120 for&#13;
Thailand. Significant improvements should be possible in PC2's performance figures over time.&#13;
3.8        Operation. Maintenance and Store Keeping.  PC2's operation and plant maintenance&#13;
standards and practices are satisfactory. With dramatic shortages of funds and very unreliable spare&#13;
part supplies, PC2 has maintained a reasonable standard of operational quality. Plant and warehouses&#13;
are meticulously kept and materials and supply are properly recorded. Major maintenance is done by&#13;
contractors while routine maintenance is done by company staff. Transmission lines are inspected&#13;
routinely and in accordance with fixed schedules. PC2's operations show technical and non-technical&#13;
losses of about 20% and 3%, respectively.&#13;
Power Company No. 3&#13;
3.9        Organization. PC3 was established in 1975 (Annex 4) following a takeover from the&#13;
French company of SIPEA. The legal basis, ownership and other institutional features of PC3 are&#13;
similar to those of PC2.&#13;
3.10       PC3, headquartered in Danang serves the central part of Viet Nam covering a total of 11&#13;
provinces, from Quang Binh to Dac Lac and Khanh Hoa, and serves a population of about 11 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
At the end of 1993, PC3 had an installed capacity of 214 MW and had substantial power purchases&#13;
from PCI and PC2. With the exception of 20 MW in hydro power and 14 MW in gas turbines, PC3's&#13;
generating capacity consists of small diesel stations, mostly in isolated areas. In 1993 it generated 255&#13;
Gwh; imported 443 Gwh from PCI, 159 Gwh from PC2, and 3 Gwh from larang II, a small MOE-&#13;
owned hydro station.&#13;
3.11        Chart 3 shows PC3's organizational set-up which conforms with the other power&#13;
companies in Viet Nam. PC3's management and staff are technically competent. Of its total staff of&#13;
5,875 in 1993, 1,526 are engineers, other university level staff (accountants, computer specialists, etc.),&#13;
technicians and draftsmen, 540 are administrative staff, and 3,809 are lower level semi-skilled workers.&#13;
By the end of 1993, PC3 had a total of 158,000 customers of which about 6,350 were classified as&#13;
industrial, 920 as agricultural, 130,000 as domestic and about 20,730 as others. PC3 employs about 27&#13;
staff per MW and has 103 customers per staff. These figures compare unfavorably with those of PC2&#13;
and can only partially be explained by the small size and vastly outstretched nature of its operations.&#13;
Significant improvements should be possible in these performance figures over time.&#13;
3.12        PC3's supply area also includes a large number of "wholesale electricity vendors" or sub-&#13;
consumers, particularly in villages, who buy electricit) from PC3 for sale to small customers through&#13;
sub-meters. A study carried out by PC3 in 1993 indicated that in addition to PC3's 158,000 regular&#13;
customers, there were about 450,000 sub-consumers who pay much more'' than the official tariff&#13;
(para. 2.23).&#13;
3.13        Operation, Maintenance and Store Keeping.  PC3 conducts regular maintenance of its&#13;
plants and warehouses and properly records its supplies. Its transmission lines are inspected at regular&#13;
intervals.  However, while the standards observed for major maintenance are reasonable, further&#13;
improvements are possible.  Technical losses, including both transmission and generation losses,&#13;
amount to about 18% while non-technical losses are about 7% of electricity produced. PC3 would need&#13;
to exercise stricter control on its operations to reduce non-technical losses down to about 3 % as planned&#13;
by the Govermnent. Agreement was reached at negotiations that PC3 would prepare and implement an&#13;
action plan, satisfactory to IDA, for progressively reducing its non-technical losses to a level of 3%.&#13;
C. Staff Development and Training&#13;
3.14        The training centers of PC2 and PC3 were originally part of the Vietnamese educational&#13;
system.   While they are now  under the control of the PCs, they still operate as national&#13;
technical/vocational schools and are staffed and equipped for that role rather than for power sector&#13;
oriented training. Consequently, their efforts tend to focus on technical education, rather than on&#13;
training for the PCs' needs. PC2's training center is the Hocmon College which was built in 1960 and&#13;
operated until 1976 by the Education Ministry. The center's role is to provide initial training in power&#13;
plant and transmission/distribution for technicians and skilled electrical workers. The training facilities&#13;
I/ The sub-charges, which range from D 450 to D 1.000. is further broken down as follows: (a) 31% of sub-consumers paying&#13;
D 450 to D 550/kWh; (b) 50% of sub-consumers paying D 550 to D 800/kWh; and (c) 19% of sub-consumers paying D 800 to&#13;
D 1,000/kWh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
are poor and inadequate. The training courses, which are provided on request and tend to be of long&#13;
duration, seem to be as extensive as these limited facilities allow. PC3's training center in Hoi-An is&#13;
similar to that of other PC training centers in Viet Nam. Equipment for practical training is virtually&#13;
non-existent and the training network is inadequate.&#13;
3.15       The MOE and the PCs are committed to a program of major upgrading of staff skills,&#13;
which is essential if the PCs are able to manage new and sophisticated plants and systems. With&#13;
investments under the proposed project, the training departments of PC2 and PC3, would acquire the&#13;
capability and resources to supply the required training services (para. 4.13).&#13;
D. Billing and Collection&#13;
3.16       PC2 and PC3 operate a decentralized billing and collection system through their district&#13;
offices. The role of the head office consists of monitoring, collecting and processing of records through&#13;
a central computer arrangement where invoices are prepared. Billing and collection are undertaken on&#13;
a monthly basis for all customers. Meter readings are done manually and transferred to account cards&#13;
in each district office. Personal computers are routinely employed in the districts permitting the&#13;
transfer of information to headquarters through diskettes. The billing and collection policy of PC2 is&#13;
satisfactory (see Annex 5 for details). The collection performance of PC2 is relatively strong and&#13;
comparable with the performance of Thai utilities, holding arrears to about 52 days on average.&#13;
3.17       Because of the nature of PC3's market, its accounts receivables at the end of 1993 stood at&#13;
D385 billion, equal to about 464 days of sales. About D30 billion in arrears were mostly owned by the&#13;
agricultural sector. While PC3's policy is such that an account becomes past due after three months in&#13;
arrears, the Government allows them to write-off arrears by way of Government fund transfers. The&#13;
latest write-off was done in February 1994 when about D300 million was transferred to PC3 from the&#13;
budget. Some of PC3's accounts are not collectable, in particular, farners suffering from poor harvest&#13;
but who continue to be provided electricity, and for them, the Government has set aside funds for their&#13;
arrears. PC3 needs to bring down the level of its receivables considerably. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that PC3 will prepare and implement an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, to reduce its&#13;
receivables. On and after December 31, 1996, its net receivables (after provision for bad debts) should&#13;
not be more than four months of sales revenue.&#13;
E. Accounting System and Procedures&#13;
3.18       The present financial and accounting systems of PC2 and PC3 are inadequate. Prior to&#13;
1990, the power subsector operated under the accounting system of centrally-planned economies. In&#13;
1990, the system was abandoned and one based on the French accounting standards was introduced&#13;
countrywide. However, the modifications to the system, which were specifically aimed at tight&#13;
government control, resulted in an unusual accounting system with the following features:&#13;
(a)   separate books and accounts are maintained for the construction and operation functions of&#13;
the PCs; no consolidated accounts are kept that provide an overall financial picture;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
(b)   official year-end financial statements are not produced and the accounts are not routinely&#13;
reconciled, casting doubt on their reliability;&#13;
(c)   cash flow statements are non-existent, making it difficult to assess the PCs' cash positions,&#13;
allocations of net income, and the extent of Government contributions by way of equity,&#13;
subsidies and grants. This information is particularly significant as unusual fund transfers&#13;
occur to the Govermnent, by way of regular depreciation charges, and from the&#13;
Government by way of budget allocations;&#13;
(d)   values of fixed assets are distorted. Upon unification of Viet Nam, the PCs' assets were&#13;
valued using standard unit prices, which was typical of the system used by many centrally-&#13;
planned economies. These asset values remained on the PCs' books at cost without regard&#13;
for the general development of the economy and inflation. After minor adjustments were&#13;
made in 1981, 1985 and 1989, a nationwide asset revaluation exercise was decreed in&#13;
1990 for all industries using the following parameters: (i) Ruble 1 = D2,400 for assets&#13;
procured from the formner Soviet Block; and (ii) US$1 = D2,400 for assets procured&#13;
abroad elsewhere. A second nationwide revaluation was undertaken in January 1992 using&#13;
the following rates of exchange: (i) Ruble 1 = D110,000 for all assets procured from the&#13;
former Soviet Block; and (ii) US$1 = D10,000 for assets procured abroad elsewhere.&#13;
Revaluing assets by equating the US dollar to the Russian Ruble is misleading, as the&#13;
value of the dollar in relation to the ruble at that time was US$1 = Ruble 100. In&#13;
summnary, because of the various accounting actions that have taken place in the valuation&#13;
of assets, it is not possible to state definitely whether the assets.are properly valued;&#13;
(e)   accounts are kept on a cash and not on an accrual basis;&#13;
(f)   depreciation is treated unconventionally, by separating depreciation into regular and&#13;
"Major Maintenance".  Currently, regular depreciation charges are remitted to the&#13;
Government in cash (except on assets financed by the PCs' own funds) while Major&#13;
Maintenance depreciation charges are retained by the PCs. In addition, there are no fixed&#13;
depreciation charges; the Government allows variations in the yearly depreciation rates in&#13;
order to adjust final financial results. The Government also permits the depreciation of&#13;
written-off assets. However, starting 1995, this requirement of separating and remitting&#13;
depreciation charges will be discontinued (para 5.9);&#13;
(g)   certain expense items such as staff bonuses, staff benefits and office maintenance,&#13;
normally recorded in the income statement, are booked as a cash outflow transaction. As&#13;
a result, net income is overstated by about 50% on average; and&#13;
(h)  land is not valued as only the Government can own land;&#13;
3.19       In the context of its upcoming Power Distribution Rehabilitation Project, ADB proposed to&#13;
finance a consulting study, "Improvement of Financial and Accounting Systems of the Power&#13;
Companies in Viet Nam" (Annex 6), aimed at introducing a modem accounting and management&#13;
information system. The Japanese Grant Facility is assisting in carrying out a study aimed at improving&#13;
and modernizing the conmmercial systems and institutional strengthening of the power sector (para.&#13;
4.19). These studies are crucial for assisting the Government in implementing the important aspects of&#13;
its Program of Economic Reforms, and for the PCs in introducing modem financial practices. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
ADB study is estimated to take about 10 months and should be available late in 1995 or early 1996&#13;
while the JGF-assisted study is expected to be completed by the end of 1995.&#13;
3.20       Until a major improvement in the accounting system is implemented, it is important to&#13;
introduce the following changes: (a) to provide an overall financial picture, consolidate the accounts of&#13;
both operation and construction divisions; (b) implement an accrual basis of accounting; (c) discontinue&#13;
the depreciation of written-off assets; (d) apply a single depreciation rate for normal depreciation&#13;
charges; (e) write off obsolete stock; (f) to reflect actual profits and losses, record all expense items in&#13;
the income statement, particularly those that apply to staff bonuses, staff benefits, and office&#13;
maintenance; and (g) make adequate annual provision for doubtful debts. Agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations that PC2 and PC3 would introduce the above changes to the accounting system&#13;
starting with the financial year 1995.&#13;
F. Financial Management and Reporting&#13;
3.21       The management practices pursued in PC2 and PC3 are outdated. The existing reporting&#13;
system has evolved primarily in response to the Government's external reporting requirements and is&#13;
used by the Government for strict monitoring of the PCs. A functional management reporting system&#13;
would be difficult to implement despite the new accounting regulations introduced in 1991. A main&#13;
drawback of this system, as far as interpreting the financial statements of PC2 and PC3 is concerned, is&#13;
that the statements do not focus on financial performance; for example, it-is impossible to calculate a&#13;
rate of return on capital invested or any other meaningful operating ratio. The ADB and JGF-financed&#13;
studies (para. 3.19) will address this issue and should help the PCs introduce modem financial&#13;
practices.&#13;
3.22       The accounting staff of PC2 and PC3 are competent, and carry out their tasks of account&#13;
keeping and reporting in accordance with the requirements of the Government. The competence of the&#13;
accounting staff of both companies should considerably facilitate the introduction of accounting reforms.&#13;
The position of the Chief Financial Officer/Chief Accountant within higher management is either&#13;
unclear or does not receive due recognition in PC2 and PC3. In PC2, for instance, the incumbent is&#13;
subordinate to the Deputy Director of Economics, as far as accounting is concerned, but reports directly&#13;
to the Director General in its capacity as Chief Financial Officer. A similar structure exists in PC3.&#13;
The arrangement reportedly did not create problems in the past, because in a centrally-planned&#13;
economy, the financial activities of PC2 and PC3 were basically confined to bookkeeping, while&#13;
financial planning and investment finance were left to the Government as and when required. With the&#13;
expected rapid expansion of the power subsector and decentralized financial decision-making transferred&#13;
to PC2 and PC3, the position of Chief Financial Officer/Chief Accountant will be crucial, and will need&#13;
to be reviewed.&#13;
G. Taxes and Insurance&#13;
3.23        PC2 and PC3 are subject to the following major taxes: (a) tax on revenues (turnover tax),&#13;
levied at 8% of power sales (net of inter-PC sales), and 4%  on other revenues; (b) environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
charge (royalty), levied at 2% on the use of water for hydro generation and calculated on the basis of&#13;
the PCs' share of revenues from power sales generated from hydro against total generation; (c) tax on&#13;
capital, levied at 2.4% of plant in service, less accumulated depreciation and assets financed from the&#13;
PCs' own funds, plus working capital; and (d) income tax on net profit, at the rate of 25% as of&#13;
September 1993, down from the 30% level of August 1993.&#13;
3.24       It has been the Government's practice to reduce the tax rates or even eliminate certain&#13;
taxes of PC2 and PC3 completely if the tax charge would result in unfavorable financial outcome for&#13;
these PCs.&#13;
3.25       In accordance with the general practice followed in Viet Nam, PC2 and PC3 do not carry&#13;
any insurance protection for buildings and their contents and for other assets. Nor do they carry any&#13;
third party liability insurance. Agreement was reached during negotiations that PC2 and PC3 would&#13;
make provisions, satisfactory to IDA, for insurance against such risks and in such amounts consistent&#13;
with appropriate practice.&#13;
H. The Budget Process&#13;
3.26       The existing budget process is designed to support applications by the PCs for funds from&#13;
the Government Budget and to provide the Government with a tool to exercise tight financial control.&#13;
The PCs' annual accounts at the close of the budget year are considered "closed" only when the&#13;
Government, through its auditing process, "approves" the accounts. The budget process also lacks&#13;
flexibility. For instance, at the beginning of the budget year, the PCs budget fuel expenses on the basis&#13;
of average hydrological conditions. However, should the availability of water during the dry season be&#13;
less favorable than anticipated, the shortfall has to be financed from the PCs' own resources, often&#13;
through expensive short-term borrowing from local banks, because additional budget funds are not&#13;
made available to them. The budget process would need to be critically reviewed under the proposed&#13;
Power Sector Institutional Strengthening study (para. 4.18).&#13;
I. Audit&#13;
3.27       There is no independent external audit of Government entities in Viet Nam. In 1991 the&#13;
Government considered establishing an "independent" audit process for SOEs and in the process created&#13;
the Viet Nam Auditing Company (VACO). VACO, with three offices in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and&#13;
Danang, was created by Government Decree No. 165. TC/QD/TCCB on May 13, 1991. It was created&#13;
as a dependent body of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and cannot therefore be considered an&#13;
independent auditing firm. However, in a joint venture with a reputable international firm, VACO&#13;
audits would be acceptable to IDA. The Govermnent has granted several foreign accounting firms&#13;
licenses to operate as independent auditors in Viet Nam. There are currently four independent auditing&#13;
firms operating in Viet Nam.&#13;
3.28       So far, the annual financial statements of PC2 and PC3, which are not published, have not&#13;
been audited by independent auditors and the PCs do not have internal auditing departments. Their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
audits, however, are routinely audited by auditing teams of the MOF and MOE. This audit, which is&#13;
also used by the MOF to determine tax liabilities, is usually conducted within one month of submission&#13;
of the PCs' annual financial statements. In addition, Government staff carries out controls on special&#13;
problems. Realizing that a full conventional and commercial audit by the Government is difficult to&#13;
perform prior to upgrading the entire accounting system, and in order to assist PC2 and PC3 to&#13;
familiarize themselves with the principles of modem accounting systems, agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that the Borrower, PC2 and PC3 will appoint independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
audit report would be made available to IDA within nine months after the close of each financial year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IV&#13;
The Project&#13;
A. Objectives and Description&#13;
4.1        The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) assist the Government in&#13;
optimizing its investment decisions and help meet demand growth; (b) help improve the efficiency of&#13;
the power supply system by: (i) rehabilitating and reinforcing transmission and distribution systems; (ii)&#13;
converting generating plants from open to combined cycle operation; and (iii) installing modem load&#13;
dispatch centers; (c) strengthen the planning, administrative and management capabilities of the power&#13;
companies through technical assistance and training; (d) rationalize and strengthen the training systems&#13;
for the power sector; and (e) assist in the review of issues and options in the promotion of electricity&#13;
energy efficiency and demand side management. Also, in association with the project, the Bank's&#13;
ESMAP would be assisting the Government in examining the issues and options in reforming the power&#13;
sector through a study entitled "Power Sector Reform and Restructuring".&#13;
Project Description&#13;
4.2        The proposed project would finance priority investments in the power systems of Southern&#13;
and Central Viet Nam falling under the jurisdictions of PC2 and PC3, respectively. Its components&#13;
include: (a) for PC2: (i) rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution system in HCMC; (ii)&#13;
conversion of three 37.5 MW open cycle turbines to a 170 MW combined cycle unit at Ba Ria; (iii)&#13;
establishment of the Southern Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Southern Region&#13;
Training Center; (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components a (i) and a&#13;
(ii); and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction supervision, and&#13;
an engineering study for the Dai Ninh Hydropower project; (b) for PC3: (i) rehabilitation and&#13;
reinforcement of the distribution systems of the cities of Hue and Nhatrang; (ii) construction of the 220&#13;
kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line and 220 kV substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang, and&#13;
expansion of the 110 kV substations at Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri; (iii) establishment of the&#13;
Central Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Central Region Training Center; (v)&#13;
resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components b (i) and b (ii); and (vi) consulting&#13;
services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction supervision. The project also includes:&#13;
(a) for MOE: (i) expansion of the National Load Dispatch Center; (ii) procurement of equipment for the&#13;
National Training Center; and (iii) engineering studies for the Son La Hydropower project; and (b) for&#13;
the Power Sector: (i) technical assistance in strategic planning, MIS, human resource development,&#13;
financial management and materials managernent; and (ii) technical assistance in demand-side&#13;
management and electricity efficiency imnprovement.&#13;
4.3        The Power Sector Reform and Restructuring study by ESMAP (para. 4.18) would,&#13;
through seminars, workshops and study tours, focus attention of the Vietnamese on issues relevant to:&#13;
(a) improving the efficiency of technical and managerial operations; (b) commercialization and&#13;
corporatization leading to greater managerial and financial autonomy with accountability; (c) the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework for the sector; and (d) an industry structure that would facilitate private&#13;
financing of power development. The study's terms of reference are at Annex 8.&#13;

Description of The Project Components&#13;
Conversion of Open Cycle Combustion Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation at Ba Ria&#13;
4.4        The existing power station at Ba Ria in the south is provided with 5 Frame 6 combustion&#13;
turbines until recently burning diesel oil. Off-shore natural gas is expected to be available at Ba Ria in&#13;
mid-1995. While providing a more economical fuel source, natural gas opens up the possibility of&#13;
increasing generation at Ba Ria, without incremental fuel consumption, by converting the open cycle&#13;
turbines to combined cycle mode with the installation of the steam cycle equipment. To justify the&#13;
large per unit capital cost of US$1,300/kW of the steam cycle equipment, a detailed economic study,&#13;
considering power and energy balance in the southern grid, was conducted by consultants. This study&#13;
establishes the need for high plant factor thermal capacity addition in the southern grid and provides the&#13;
rationale for conversion to combined cycle operation at Ba Ria. A subsequent detailed technical&#13;
feasibility study by the same consultant establishes the technical parameters for the conversion of 3x37.5&#13;
MW combustion turbines to combined cycle operation by the installation of 3 heat recovery boilers and&#13;
a 57 MW steam turbine. The cooling source for the steam cycle is currently planned to be through the&#13;
creation of a pond in the nearby estuary. The economics of the alternative with land-based cooling&#13;
towers, which would eliminate the aquatic environmental impact, is under consideration by PC2. If the&#13;
cooling pond alternative is adopted, a part of a cooperative shrimp farm would need to be acquired and&#13;
suitable compensation paid (para. 4.29).&#13;
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)&#13;
4.5        HCMC is the industrial, scientific, technical and international relations center of Viet&#13;
Nam. Its metropolis, with 12 districts and an area of 140 sq km has a population of 3.2 million&#13;
(population density: 23,000 persons/sq km), whereas its suburbs, with 6 districts and an area of 1,916&#13;
sq km have a population of 1.4 million (population density: 7 persons/sq Ian). The MV and LV power&#13;
distribution systems in HCMC are operated by the Power Supply Department, a subsidiary of PC2,&#13;
while PC2 itself operates the HV transmission system and the HV/MV source substations. The demand&#13;
for electricity in 1993 was 420 MW, 2,352 Gwh p. a., with losses amounting to about 19% of which&#13;
about 3% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent detailed evaluation of the HCMC distribution&#13;
system concludes that: (a) many of the substations are overloaded, almost all of their equipment is old,&#13;
undermaintained due to lack of spares and poses serious operational problems and safety hazards; (b)&#13;
the overhead MV network, though in a reasonable physical condition, has almost half its circuits&#13;
overloaded, whereas the underground MV cables are over 40 years old and prone to frequent faults;&#13;
and (c) the LV overhead network is in a very bad condition and is in urgent need of rehabilitation.&#13;
4.6        A master plan study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the HCMC distribution system&#13;
was carried out by consultants. The Base Case load forecast scenario developed by the consultants,&#13;
based on an update of MOE's recent forecasts, indicates the demand growing from 510 MW and 2,869&#13;
Gwh in 1994 to 1,237 MW and 7,286 Gwh in 2000, reflecting an average growth rate of about 16%.&#13;
The study presents the investments in the short and medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the&#13;
network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and reconductoring), which would reduce its losses&#13;
from the current level of about 19% to about 10% by 2005. If these investments are not made, the&#13;
losses would increase tremendously, and system reliability would seriously deteriorate. The planning&#13;
basis is considered to be reasonable and practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of the MV and LV lines and MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
page 2 for details). Provision has been made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected&#13;
by this project component (para. 4.27).&#13;
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Hue&#13;
4.7        Hue (population 375,000), the political capital of Viet Nam from 1802 to 1945, is the&#13;
cultural, religious and educational center of the country. Its ancient monuments have been classified by&#13;
UNESCO as part of the world heritage and the Government attaches great significance to developing&#13;
Hue as a tourist center. Apart from its touristic importance, Hue has a number of industries and has a&#13;
good potential for industrial growth. The demand for electricity in 1993 was 17.5 MW, 74 Gwh p. a.,&#13;
with losses amounting to about 20% of which about 6% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent&#13;
detailed evaluation of Hue distribution concludes that: (a) the networks and their equipment are very old&#13;
and in a state of disrepair due to lack of spares; (b) the networks are under-sized and over-extended,&#13;
incurring excessive losses and voltage drops; and (c) the circuits are cluttered and clearances are below&#13;
standard, posing safety hazards. The distribution system is hardly adequate to meet existing demands&#13;
and is totally incapable of meeting future demand.&#13;
4.8        A detailed feasibility study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Hue distribution&#13;
system was carried out by PC3 and reviewed and updated by consultants. A load forecast considering&#13;
detailed sector-wise analysis of demand growth and the current restrictions on electricity usage,&#13;
indicates the demand growing from 17.5 MW and 74 Gwh in 1993 to 42.8 MW and 170 Gwh in 2000,&#13;
reflecting an average growth rate of about 13%. The study presents the investments in the short and&#13;
medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and&#13;
reconductoring), which would reduce its total losses from the current level of about 20% to about 10%&#13;
by 2000. In the absence of these investments the losses would increase to over 35%, if indeed the&#13;
network could withstand the increased stresses. The planning basis is considered to be reasonable and&#13;
practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and expansion of the MV and LV lines and&#13;
MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9, page 6 for details). Provision has been&#13;
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.27).&#13;
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Nhatrang&#13;
4.9        Nhatrang (population 280,000), the capital of Khanh Hoa Province, is one of the most&#13;
important tourist resorts in Viet Nam. It is also a cultural, economic and scientific center, with a&#13;
substantial industrial base. The demand for electricity in 1993 was 18 MW, 84 Gwh p. a., with losses&#13;
amounting to about 15% of which about 3.5% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent detailed&#13;
evaluation of Nhatrang distribution concludes that: (a) the networks and their equipment are very old&#13;
and in a state of disrepair due to lack of spares; (b) the networks are under-sized and over-extended,&#13;
incurring excessive losses and voltage drops; and (c) the circuits are cluttered and clearances below&#13;
standard, posing safety hazards. The distribution system is hardly adequate to meet existing demands&#13;
and is totally incapable of meeting future demand.&#13;
4.10       A detailed feasibility study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Nhatrang distribution&#13;
system was carried out by PC3 and reviewed and updated by consultants. A load forecast considering&#13;
detailed sector-wise analysis of demand growth and the current restrictions on electricity usage,&#13;
indicates the demand growing from 18 MW and 83.8 Gwh in 1993 to 51.7 MW and 213 Gwh in 2000,&#13;
reflecting an average growth rate of about 16%. The study presents the investments in the short and&#13;
medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
reconductoring), which would reduce its total losses from the current level of about 15% to about 7.5%&#13;
by 2000. In the absence of these investments the losses would increase to over 28%, if indeed the&#13;
network could withstand the increased stresses. The planning basis is considered to be reasonable and&#13;
practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and expansion of the MV and LV lines and&#13;
MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9, page 8 for details). Provision has been&#13;
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.27).&#13;
New Southern and Central Region Load Dispatch Centers&#13;
Strengthening of The National Load Dispatch Center&#13;
4.11       The northern, southern and central 220kV power systems currently operated by PC1, PC2&#13;
and PC3, respectively, are interconnected by a 500 kV transmission system. A National Load Dispatch&#13;
Center (NLDC), has been installed in the Ministry of Energy's (MOE) Hanoi headquarters and is being&#13;
operated by MOE staff. PC1 operates an existing Regional Load Dispatch Center (RLDC) from its&#13;
headquarters in Hanoi. The center was built about 10 years ago with assistance from the former USSR,&#13;
and provides basic monitoring functions for the northern region network. PC2 currently coordinates&#13;
load dispatch from its operations headquarters using basic telephone facilities and has comnnissioned a&#13;
new distribution system control center for Ho Chi Minh City. The latter is provided with supervisory&#13;
control and data acquisition facilities under a Swedish aid project. PC3 has rudimnentary supervision&#13;
facilities with limited PLC and VHF communications. Existing regional load dispatch facilities are&#13;
inadequate and need to be upgraded for proper monitoring and control of the respective regional power&#13;
systems and to facilitate optimal dispatch of power between regions.&#13;
4.12       A Conceptual Master Plan for the design and operation of the entire load dispatch system&#13;
in Viet Namn has been prepared by consultants. This plan lays down the philosophy of hierarchical&#13;
control of the system. The master plan also specifies the basic requirements of the hardware and&#13;
software for the SCADA and Energy Management (EMS) systems and the communication network.&#13;
Funding of the RLDCs for South and Central Viet Nam and components for extension of the National&#13;
Load Dispatch Center would be covered under the proposed project (Annex 9, pages 4, 10 and 18).&#13;
The RLDC for North is proposed to be funded by SIDA of Sweden. A building for housing the&#13;
southem RLDC has already been constructed whereas a new building would be built for the central&#13;
RLDC.&#13;
Southem and Central Region Training Centers&#13;
Equipment for The National Training Center&#13;
4.13       The existing facilities in the south, center and the north of Viet Nam for training of&#13;
technicians and staff of the respective power companies are ill-equipped and outdated primarily due to&#13;
lack of funding. While the building for the new training center in Hanoi, which would function as the&#13;
National Training Center, has been constructed, it is void of equipment and facilities. Several studies&#13;
have been made in the past for upgrading each of the training centers; an overall study reviewing the&#13;
training needs of the entire power sector and specifying a staged development of the training centers and&#13;
proposals for training was made by consultants. The proposed project covers the first phase of&#13;
upgrading the training facilities for the power sector and includes: (a) extensions of the existing works&#13;
facilities, provision of urgently needed training equipment, and training of trainers for the South and&#13;
Center; and (b) provision of equipment for the National Training Center (Annex 9, pages 5, 11 and&#13;
19).&#13;

Kronabuk-Nhatran2 220 kV Line and 220 kV Substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang&#13;
4.14       The construction of the 500 kV North-Center-South transmission line and the establishment&#13;
of a 500/220 kV substation at Pleicu (see Grid Map), opens the way for providing reliable power to&#13;
central Viet Nam. The plan for transmitting power from Pleicu to Nhatrang via Krongbuk has been&#13;
approved by the Prime Minister and PC3 is already executing the Pleicu-Krongbuk section. PC3's&#13;
feasibility study and basic design for the 220 kV system expansion in central Viet Nam was reviewed&#13;
for IDA by consultants and found to be acceptable. The proposed project provides for the construction&#13;
of: (a) a 147 km, 336 AAAC conductor, single circuit 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line;&#13;
(b) Krongbuk substation with one 220/110/20 kV, 63 MVA transformer, 3x220 kV and 2xll 0 kV&#13;
switching bays and 5x20 kV feeder outlets; and (c) Nhatrang substation with one 220/110/20 kV, 125&#13;
MVA transformer, 2x220 kV and 2xl 10 kV switching bays and 6x20 kV feeder outlets. Land for the&#13;
substations and right of way for the transmission line have already been secured. Provision has been&#13;
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.28).&#13;
Reinforcement of The 110 kV substations at Nhatrang. Cau Do and Lien Tri.&#13;
4.15       Based on detailed demand projections by PC3, reinforcement of 110 kV substations is&#13;
necessary to meet the demand growth in the areas of Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lientri in the north of&#13;
central Viet Nam (see Grid Map). The project provides for the installation of: (a) lx25 MVA, 110/20&#13;
kV transformer, 4xll O kV and 4x20 kV feeders at Nhatrang substation; (b) lx25 MVA, 110/35 kV&#13;
transformer, 2x110 kV and 6x35 kV feeders at Cao Do substation; and (d) lx25 MVA, 110/35 kV&#13;
transformer, 2x1 10 kV and 6x35 kV feeders at Lien Tri substation.&#13;
Consulting Studies for Proiect Mananement and Technical Assistance Engineering Studies for Future&#13;
Hydro Proiects&#13;
4.16       Based on a detailed evaluation of the needs of the various implementing agencies,&#13;
provision has been made in the project for adequate staff-months (SM) of expatriate consulting services&#13;
to assist in engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for: (a) the Ba Ria combined&#13;
cycle conversion (100 SM); (b) HCMC distribution (60 SM); (c) Southern RLDC (60 SM); (d)&#13;
Southern Training Centre, including training (50 SM); (e) Hue/Nhatrang distribution (50 SM); (f)&#13;
Central RLDC (60 SM); (g) Central Training Center, including training (50 SM); (h) 220 kV line and&#13;
substations (30 SM); (i) National LDC (30 SM); and (j) engineering studies for Dai Ninh and Son La&#13;
Hydropower projects (60 SM each). The terms of reference for all the project related consulting&#13;
assistance have been agreed with the implementing agencies.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Demand Side Management.&#13;
4.17       While there is a growing awareness of the need for Demand Side Management (DSM) in&#13;
Government and utility circles, there has been very limited application of energy efficiency measures&#13;
and other DSM activities in Viet Nam. There is also very little energy end-use data available in the&#13;
country. Viet Nam needs to implement all available cost effective DSM measures to use electricity in&#13;
the most efficient manner, commensurate with the country's development. The main objectives of the&#13;
study (Terms of Reference are at Annex 10) are to: (a) identify a menu of DSM opportunities in the&#13;
industrial, commercial and residential sectors; (b) prioritize and evaluate these DSM sector alternatives,&#13;
based on their energy sector impact and cost effectiveness; (c) define an appropriate institutional and&#13;
regulatory framework for DSM program implementation; (d) introduce a resource planning approach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
(e.g Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)) which would permit the cost-effective assessment of all&#13;
sU.   and demand energy resource options; and finally (e) identify DSM components that could be&#13;
coL   red for financing under an IDA Energy Sector Credit. Agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
that wle Borrower would furnish to IDA for review and comments: (a) the findings of the study; and (b)&#13;
its proposals for the implementation of the study's recommendations, and thereafter implement the&#13;
proposals taking into consideration IDA's commnents.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Power Sector Reforrn &amp; Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
4.18     To meet Government's overall objectives of reforming state enterprises and moving from&#13;
centrally planned to market-oriented mechanisms, two major technical assistance initiatives are planned.&#13;
The first, being conducted by the Banks ESMAP is focussed on an immediate need articulated by the&#13;
Government. This technical assistance is designed to assist the Government and EVN in making the&#13;
transition from the existing power sector structure to the new structure.  This effort is based on the&#13;
principles of: (a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector; (b) commercialization and&#13;
corporatization of the constituent operations to provide greater managerial and financial autonomy; (c)&#13;
developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for greater enterprise&#13;
autonomy and requisite government regulatory oversight; and (d) a financially viable and open sector&#13;
structure that allows for increased private involvement in financing sector expansion. (Terms of&#13;
Reference in Annex 8).&#13;
4.19     The second, technical assistance program under the proposed project, directed at much&#13;
needed institutional strengthening, is being financed by the Japanese Grant Facility. This technical&#13;
assistance would focus on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of&#13;
commercial management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information&#13;
flows, under the reformed sector structure. (Terms of Reference in Annex 11). The study will&#13;
reconmmend: (a) appropriate levels of consolidation of accounting statements and balance sheets of the&#13;
subordinate entities under EVN; (b) organization of line and staff functions of the newly defined&#13;
entities; and (c) the operational, financial and MIS reporting requirements within the new entities.  A&#13;
complementary technical assistance program is being funded by ADB which focuses on the development&#13;
of cost and financial accounting systems (Terms of Reference in Annex 6). Close coordination of these&#13;
complementary technical assistance programs would be ensured from the outset. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that the Borrower would furnish to IDA for review and comments: (a) the&#13;
findings of the studies; and (b) its proposals for the implementation of the studies' recommendations,&#13;
and thereafter implement the proposals taking into account IDA's comments.&#13;
B. Implementation&#13;
4.20           PC2 and PC3 would be responsible for implementing the major portion of the project,&#13;
managing components falling within their jurisdiction in South and Central Viet Nam, respectively.&#13;
The technical experts of the MOE would be responsible for implementing the strengthening of the&#13;
National Load Dispatch Center, while PCI will assist MOE in implementing the component for&#13;
strengthening of the National Training Center in Hanoi. The Personnel Department of MOE will&#13;
manage the technical assistance studies relating to Power Sector Institutional Strengthening and Power&#13;
Sector Reform and Restructuring, while the Energy Institute will manage the technical assistance study&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
for Demand Side Management. Both PC2 and PC3 have substantial in-house expertise in engineering&#13;
and design; this would be reinforced through assistance from PIDC2 and PIDC1, respectively.&#13;
Adequate consulting assistance is being provided under the project (para. 4.16) to assist the&#13;
implementing agencies in developing designs and bid documents, evaluating bids and preparing&#13;
evaluation reports, project management including construction supervision and progress reporting.&#13;
Draft bidding documents following the Bank guidelines have already been prepared by consultants for&#13;
HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang distribution systems, the Southern and Central RLDCs and the 220 kV&#13;
system components. These will be refined and finalized with the assistance of the consultants employed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
4.21           Both PC2 and PC3 have prepared Project Implementation Plans following the Bank&#13;
guidelines; these indicate the organizational arrangements for project management and the&#13;
implementation bar charts.  Project Management Units (with a Project Manager and staff positions)&#13;
will be set up within PC2 and PC3 specifically for managing the IDA-assisted project components (see&#13;
Charts 4 and 5). Bidding Evaluation Commnittees (having representation from the MOE) will be set up&#13;
for PC2 and PC3 for approving bid documents and contract awards.&#13;
4.22           The Power Distribution Company in HCMC and the provincial distribution authorities&#13;
in Hue and Nhatrang will play a major role in managing the distribution projects and constructing the&#13;
networks. About 50% of installation work would be let out on contract to local firms through&#13;
competitive bidding and the rest done through forced account. Construction for the 220 kV lines and&#13;
the 220kV and 110 kV substations will be handled by PC3 in a similar manner. While PC2's load&#13;
dispatch department has adequate expertise in managing the RLDC project, PC3 will avail itself of&#13;
substantial assistance from PIDC1 and MOE. Both PC2 and PC3 have adequate experience in handling&#13;
the training center components, with necessary expatriate consultancy assistance. The Ba Ria combined&#13;
cycle component will be managed by PC2 with the assistance of PIDC2; its installation will be let out&#13;
on turnkey basis.&#13;
4.23           The bar charts for implementing the project components and the key project dates are&#13;
given in Annex 12. The major portion of the project implementation would be over the 1995-1997&#13;
period. The Vietnamese institutions are technically well experienced in implementing the project&#13;
components and with the expatriate consulting assistance provided under the project, no substantive&#13;
problems are foreseen in efficient and timely implementation of the project.  The implementing&#13;
arrangements are satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.24           Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical&#13;
execution and financial reports were agreed, at negotiations, with each implementing agency. It would&#13;
also be agreed that each agency will furnish quarterly progress reports. An Implementation Completion&#13;
Report (ICR) will be drafted by IDA not later than six months after completion of the Credit and&#13;
agreement was reached with MOE, PC2 and PC3 to assist in its preparation. The agencies will adopt&#13;
the plan for the operational phase of the project and together with IDA, define the performance&#13;
indicators to be used to monitor operations and development impact. The Agencies will also prepare&#13;
and make available to IDA their own evaluation reports, including summary reports which will be&#13;
attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial operation,&#13;
its costs and benefits, IDA's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the Credit&#13;
Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the Credit were achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
4.25           Supervision of this project will extend over a period of five years, 1995-1999. The&#13;
key issues that would be focused upon are: (a) review of Viet Nam's power development plan in&#13;
keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with the Government on&#13;
tariffs for the power sector; (c) monitoring of compliance with financial covenants to assure the&#13;
financial health of the PCs while undertaking large investment programs; (d) monitoring of the&#13;
implementation of the environmental impact mitigation measures for Ba Ria and rehabilitation plans for:&#13;
(i) the 220 kV transmission line and substations; and (ii) people likely to be displaced due to&#13;
construction of the distribution lines and substations; and (e) technical supervision of physical&#13;
implementation of the project components. The IDA missions would also assist the Government in&#13;
analyzing issues and options in power sector institutional strengthening and in formulating strategy and&#13;
concrete plans for DSM. Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering,&#13;
economics, financial analysis and rehabilitation. Three missions annually for a period of three years&#13;
(normally coinciding with preparatory missions for future IDA-assisted projects) are foreseen for&#13;
adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a) power engineer, economist&#13;
and financial analyst -- 24 staff-weeks; and (b) rehabilitation specialist -- 9 staff-weeks. Key project&#13;
performance indicators that would be used for supervision are given in Annex 13. These performance&#13;
indicators cover: (a) the reduction of losses; (b) the reduction of accounts receivable; and (c) the timely&#13;
completion of Load Dispatch and Training Centers - all of which are linked to improving the efficiency&#13;
of the power sector operations, which is a primary objective of the project. Also, setting of target dates&#13;
for the completion of institutional studies would contribute towards timely sequencing of reforms in the&#13;
sector. Finally, monitoring of target completion dates for major components of the project would&#13;
strengthen project implementation discipline, while environmental and resettlement related monitoring&#13;
would ensure environmentally and socially acceptable development.&#13;
C. Environment and Resettlement&#13;
4.26           All load dispatch and training centers and the expansions of the 110 kV substations of&#13;
Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri are on existing land plots and in some cases in existing buildings and&#13;
do not pose any environmental issues. Rehabilitation of old, cluttered distribution networks in HCMC,&#13;
Hue and Nhatrang, predominantly using insulated conductors, largely running along existing corridors,&#13;
would contribute to greater safety and present better aesthetic appearance. No PCB is used in the&#13;
power transformers that would be replaced under the project. The routes of distribution lines and&#13;
locations of distribution substations may in exceptional cases involve displacement of some people. The&#13;
220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line route traversing through agricultural and tree-crop land,&#13;
does not encroach on ecologically sensitive areas. However, 80 houses would need to be relocated&#13;
along the line route. Although the line traverses through areas inhabited by ethnic people, care has&#13;
been taken in routing to ensure that no ethnic people are affected by the project. The 220 kV Krongbuk&#13;
and Nhatrang substations are located on grass land.&#13;
Distribution Systems for Ho Chi Minh City. Hue and Nhatran,&#13;
4.27           The detailed design of the MV and LV distribution systems for HCMC, Hue and&#13;
Nhatrang would be finalized later. A detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for this component&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
cannot, therefore, be prepared at this stage. The RAP is being prepared in two phases: (a) RAP Phase-&#13;
1 (see Annex 14 for details), which has already been prepared, includes: (i) the resettlement principles;&#13;
(ii) institutional and legal framework including entitlement policies; (iii) implementation arrangements;&#13;
(iv) peoples' participation in implementation; (v) grievance redressal mechanisms; and (vi) provision for&#13;
internal and extemal monitoring; and (b) RAPs Phase-2, which will consist of: (i) results of the socio-&#13;
economic census and socio-economic survey of the project affected persons (PAPs) and properties to be&#13;
affected; (ii) detailed compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various&#13;
categories of PAPs; (iii) a timetable for implementation; (iv) institutional responsibilities for&#13;
implementation; (v) a detailed budget for funding the various compensation and rehabilitation measures;&#13;
and (vi) intemal and extemal monitoring arrangements. The census and socio-economic surveys under&#13;
the RAPs, Phase-2 will be completed as soon as possible but at least 6 months prior to the estimated&#13;
date for commencement of construction. It was agreed at negotiations that the RAPs, Phase-2 will be:&#13;
(a) furnished to IDA no later than 3 months prior to their implementation; (b) undertaken only after&#13;
approval by IDA and the Government; and (c) completed at least 1 month before the beginning of&#13;
construction work in any given area. The Phase-I RAP was agreed with the Govermnent prior to&#13;
negotiations. Approval of the Phase-2 RAPs by IDA and the Govermnent would be a condition for&#13;
credit disbursement against expenditures incurred against the distribution systems sub-components of the&#13;
project.&#13;
220 kV Kron2buk-Nhatran2 Line and Substations at Kron2buk and Nhatrang&#13;
4.28           For the 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang line and terminal substations at Krongbuk and&#13;
Nhatrang, a RAP has been prepared for the 85 families that would be affected by the transmission line&#13;
(see Annex 14 for details). Only land directly under the transmission towers and the houses in the right&#13;
of way (ROW) will need to be acquired. Land, not directly under the towers, can continue to be used&#13;
for agricultural purposes with some restrictions on the height of trees. The PAPs will be relocated&#13;
close to their present location in order to ensure that their socio-economic lifestyles will not be affected.&#13;
The form of compensation for land will be "land for land". Compensation will be paid at replacement&#13;
cost for houses and structures and at market rates for trees and crops. The RAP will be implemented&#13;
by PC3 with the involvement of PAPs and the peoples' committees at the provincial, district and&#13;
commune levels. Adequate mechanisms have been provided for the redressal of grievances and for&#13;
external and internal supervision and monitoring. The RAP is in compliance with the Bank's&#13;
operational directives and is acceptable to IDA. The RAP was agreed with the Government prior to&#13;
negotiations. It was agreed at negotiations that PC3 would carry out the RAP as approved by IDA and&#13;
the Government.&#13;
Ba Ria Combined Cycle Conversion&#13;
4.29           A detailed environmental assessment (Annex 22, Ref 9a and 9b; Annex 15 - EA&#13;
Overview) has concluded that with proper design and mitigation measures, atmospheric impacts (NO,&#13;
and noise levels) and aquatic impacts (cooling water temperature, chlorine concentration and impact on&#13;
shrimp farming and mangroves) would be within acceptable limits. The EA has been approved by the&#13;
Government. An alternative cooling system using cooling towers is being studied. If this option is&#13;
decided upon, there would be no need for creating a cooling water lagoon in the river estuary and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
corresponding impact on the marine environment would disappear.- In the event a cooling water&#13;
lagoon is required, a part of a cooperative shrimp farm will need to be acquired. The farm has more&#13;
land than can effectively be utilized by the present number of members. Hence, acquisition of a part of&#13;
this shrimp farm will not adversely affect the livelihood of any of its members. Compensation rates&#13;
acceptable to the cooperative have been agreed upon between the farmers, the local district peoples'&#13;
committee and PC2. It was agreed during negotiations that PC2 would: (a) design the plant and follow&#13;
appropriate mitigation measures; (b) set up an environmental unit and an environmental coordinator as&#13;
part of the management structure of the power station, as outlined in the EA document; and (c)&#13;
compensate the shrimp farming community at rates that have been mutually agreed upon.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
4.30            The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is&#13;
estimated at US$247.9 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$165.9 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies are assumed at 10% of the base cost for all project components. Price contingencies are&#13;
estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 5% per annum for local cost components and 2.3% per&#13;
annum for foreign cost components, following the Bank's latest forecasts. Table 4.1 summarizes the&#13;
cost estimates for the project (details are at Annex 9).&#13;
E. Financing Plan&#13;
4.31            The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2. The proposed IDA credit of&#13;
US$165 million equivalent would meet almost 100% of the foreign cost of the project and about 67% of&#13;
project financing requirements. The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Government at IDA's&#13;
standard rate for a 40 year terrn including 5 years of grace on repayment of principal. Of the total&#13;
Credit amount of US$165 million equivalent, US$117 million equivalent would be onlent to PC2 and&#13;
US$40 million equivalent to PC3. An amount of US$8 million would be used by the Government for&#13;
project components to be executed by the MOE. The credit would be on-lent to PC2 and PC3 in US&#13;
dollars at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, with repayment over 20 years, including a grace&#13;
period of 5 years, and foreign exchange risk being borne by PC2 and PC3. The finalization of&#13;
subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and PC2 and PC3, acceptable to IDA, would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.&#13;
1/ The current proposal is to use cooling towers and an EIA for this alternative, which eliminates the aquatic impact, has also&#13;
been prepared.&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
4.32            About 93%  (US$153.5 million equivalent) of the IDA credit would be used for&#13;
financing goods procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank guidelines.&#13;
In the evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of preference equal to 15 % of&#13;
the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less,&#13;
will be allowed for domestic manufactures. About 6% (US$10 million equivalent) of the credit amount&#13;
would be used for financing consulting services procured following the Bank procedures for the&#13;
employment of consultants. About 1% (US$1.6 million equivalent) of the credit would be used for&#13;
financing specialized equipment (including testing and measuring equipment) using the following&#13;
procedures complying with the Bank guidelines: (a) Limited International Bidding (LIB), aggregating&#13;
US$1.2 million equivalent; and (b) International Shopping (IS) aggregating US$0.4 million equivalent.&#13;
Contracts under these procedures would not exceed the equivalent of US$200,000 each for LIB and&#13;
US$50,000 each for IS.&#13;
4.33            The bid documents would follow the text of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.&#13;
All bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services would be&#13;
subject to prior review and approval by IDA. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to&#13;
be: (a) ICB - 20 packages (Annex 16), 13 for PC3, 5 for PC2 and 2 for MOE; and (b) LIB and IS -&#13;
about 14 packages. A total of about 620 staff-months of consulting services will be engaged under 11&#13;
contracts (para 4.16).&#13;
4.34            Local contracts for installation would not be financed from the IDA credit. About&#13;
50% of installation work for distribution system rehabilitation and expansion, transmission line and&#13;
substations would be contracted to local firms through a competitive bidding process satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. The balance of such installation work would be undertaken on force-account basis using the PCs&#13;
own resources including those of their subsidiaries. These personnel have long experience in executing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
installation work of this nature. Implementation of the Ba Ria combined cycle plant component would&#13;
be on turnkey basis.&#13;
4.35           Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the components expected to&#13;
be financed out of the proposed IDA credit.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.36           The IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, or&#13;
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for goods procured through ICB; (b) 50% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally; (c) 100% of foreign expenditures for goods purchased&#13;
through LIB or IS; and (d) 100% of expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes. As no&#13;
contract is expected to be less than about US$200,000 equivalent (except for a few contracts under IS&#13;
procedures), Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would not be followed.  To facilitate&#13;
disbursements, three Special Accounts would be established in US currency for PC2, PC3 and MOE on&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA with deposits of US$4.0 million (PC2), US$1.5 million (PC3)&#13;
and US$0.6 million (MOE). Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly or when the&#13;
account is drawn by 30% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside&#13;
of the Special Accounts (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments) a&#13;
minimum application value of 20% of the authorized allocation of the Special Accounts would be&#13;
observed.&#13;
4.37           Retroactive financing would be permitted to the extent bf US$5.0 million equivalent&#13;
for payments made, prior to the date of the Credit Agreement but after August 23, 1994 (the appraisal&#13;
starting date), for contracting urgently required goods and consulting services. This is necessary to&#13;
meet the project implementation schedule.&#13;
4.38           Annex 17 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit and the&#13;
standard profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. The credit is assumed to be disbursed&#13;
about three years faster than the profile, based on actual performance of the Vietnamese on other power&#13;
projects and the preparatory work already undertaken. The project is expected to be completed by June&#13;
30, 1998 and the closing date for the credit would be June 30, 1999.&#13;

Chapter V&#13;
Financial Aspects&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
5.1        The accounting procedures of PC2 and PC3 comprise several features which make a&#13;
conventional financial analysis difficult (para. 3.18). Hence, the income statements and balance sheets&#13;
for FY92 and FY93 were modified to conform, to the extent possible, to the concept of accrued income&#13;
and expenses: (a) revenues from sales of power were recomputed to an accrual basis; (b) foreign&#13;
exchange equivalents were restated to those in effect at the end of the respective financial year; (c)&#13;
depreciation on fully depreciated assets was eliminated; and (d) receivables were corrected in line with&#13;
the revenue adjustment. In addition, modifications were made to the income statements, particularly in&#13;
regard to certain operational expense items (para. 3.18) which PC2 and PC3 used to simply capitalize&#13;
on the balance sheet. Furthermore, revenues of D 140 billion were added to the 1993 income statement&#13;
of PC2 to offset depreciation expenses disallowed by the Government.&#13;
5.2        Thus modified, the accounts of PC2 and PC3 serve as a reasonable basis for the financial&#13;
projections. Until such time that the studies (para. 3.19) are completed and accounts changed to&#13;
comply with international utility practices, the indices discussed in this chapter need to be viewed with&#13;
caution.&#13;
B. Past and Present Financial Performance&#13;
5.3        The Government's policy reforms in the power sector meant to give all PCs increased&#13;
autonomy in the operation and management of their assets. To this end, Decree No. 388 (Formation&#13;
and Dissolution of SOEs) was enacted in 1976. This allowed the PCs to engage in business activities&#13;
with a degree of independence which up to that time was not possible. However, defined corporate&#13;
objectives, mechanisms to foster managerial efficiency or financial discipline, and the institutional and&#13;
organizational systems and skills necessary to translate this increased autonomy into actual practice are&#13;
still not available. Thus, while sector reforms allowed the PCs to be responsible for their day-to-day&#13;
operations, matters relating to planning, budgeting, staffing, appointing of high level staff, contracting,&#13;
pricing, and financing of investments are still subject to Government approval, through the MOE.&#13;
While the resolution creating the PCs gives them the responsibility to manage and utilize their resources&#13;
"paying attention to high rates of return", and to continuously accumulate funds for the Govermnent and&#13;
themselves, there is no explicit financial mandate to ensure that the PCs' revenues be sufficient to meet&#13;
operating expenses, depreciation and interest charges.&#13;
5.4        A summary of the actual operating results of PC2 and PC3 for FY92 and FY93 is&#13;
presented in Table 5.1; the detailed statements are given in Annexes 18 and 19.&#13;

5.5          PC2's FY92-1993 financial results show that it was able to generate revenues sufficient to&#13;
cover all operating expenses (including depreciation), as well as interest expenses and income taxes.&#13;
Energy sales grew by 17%, from 3,118 Gwh in FY92 to 3,646 Gwh in FY93 and revenues from D&#13;
1,660 billion to D 2,106 billion, or 27%. Major portions of PC2's operating expenses were for fuel,&#13;
48%, and depreciation, 24% of revenues. Operating income in FY93 was 23% higher than in FY92,&#13;
as PC2 was able to hold down operating expenses to 90% of total revenues. Because of increasing&#13;
sales and improved operating ratio, PC2's net income almost doubled, from D 76 billion in FY92 to D&#13;
151 billion inFY93.&#13;
5.6         While PC2's financial performance is satisfactory, PC3's finances are a matter of serious&#13;
concern. PC3 sold 638 Gwh in FY93, 19% higher than in FY92 and its total revenues increased by&#13;
26%  from  D 243 bilY;on to D 306 billion.  However, PC3's revenues were not enough to offset&#13;
operating expenses incurred in either year, and the result was operating losses of D 139 billion in FY92&#13;
and D 194 billion in FY93. The difference in the operating performances of PC2 and PC3 is largely&#13;
due to their different markets. While PC2 sells to the more compact urban subscribers with a large&#13;
proportion of industrial consumers at higher tariff levels, PC3 sells predominantly in smaller towns and&#13;
rural areas, at lower tariff levels. Also, PC3 has a higher generation expense as it has a large number&#13;
of isolated diesel stati ,-. The Government is aware of PC3's unfavorable financial situation and has&#13;
taken actions to remedy it, including reducing the price PC3 has to pay for purchased power from PC1&#13;
and PC2 (from D 200/kWh to D 5/kWh), reducing the negotiated fuel/diesel price which PC3 pays, and&#13;
adjusting the amount of regular and major maintenance depreciation which PC3 may remit and keep,&#13;
respectively. While the greatly subsidized transfer price of power from PC1 and PC2 to PC3 has&#13;
alleviated PC3's financial situation somewhat, it has had a negative effect on the finances of PC1 and&#13;
PC2, representing about D 90 billion of lost revenues to PCI and PC2.&#13;

5.7        Table 5.2 demonstrates the serious weakness of PC2 and PC3's financial condition and the&#13;
anomalous situation of its capital structure. PC2's equity base in FY92 of D 4,809 billion, consisting&#13;
of Government capital of D 4,838 billion and accumulated losses of D 29 billion in FY92, increased to&#13;
D 6,011 billion in FY93 (D 5,889 billion of capital and D 122 billion of retained earnings). PC3's&#13;
FY92 equity amounted to D 1,169 billion of which D 1,330 billion was capital and D 161 billion was&#13;
accumulated losses. In FY93, PC3's equity increased to D 1,875 billion consisting of D 2,230 billion&#13;
of capital and D 355 billion of accumulated losses. Because the finances of both PCs were capitalized&#13;
solely from Government contributions, the PCs had no long term borrowing in FY92 and had only D&#13;
270 billion, in the case of PC2, in FY93. The ratio of debt to equity, the'refore, had been insignificant&#13;
in these years. However, the finances show that while both PCs benefit from 100% Government&#13;
funding, they have suffered from a lack of funds so that their ability to finance and plan for operating&#13;
and capital works, as well as to maintain properly their existing investments, has been severely&#13;
constrained. The main reason for this lies in the Government requirement that PCs remit their&#13;
depreciation charge. Up to the end of 1988, the PCs were required to remit 50% of their calculated&#13;
depreciation to the Government and retain the balance to fund capital works. In 1990, a change was&#13;
implemented allowing them to retain full depreciation, however, due to the Government's budgetary&#13;
constraints, this was not implemented and in 1992, the PCs were required to remit anywhere from 30-&#13;
100% of depreciation charge to the Govermnent. In FY93, PC2 incurred depreciation expenses of&#13;
about D 482 billion of which D 324 billion were remitted to the Government, while PC3 remitted its&#13;
entire D 132 billion. Furthermore, the Government also required the PCs to continue depreciating and&#13;
remitting fully depreciated assets. In effect, the Government has not provided the PCs with any&#13;
permanent cash equity, as whatever Government capital was provided was reimbursed each year&#13;
through these depreciation charges. Consequently, the PCs' financial performance and liquidity has&#13;
suffered with no ability to finance capital investments, sufficient retained earnings to finance future&#13;
expansion have not been accumulated, and financial resiliency to withstand unexpected business crises&#13;
has been eroded.&#13;
Fixed Assets Revaluation and Rate of Return&#13;
5.8        The PCs are required to pay to the Government an annual fixed amount, set by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF), for amortization of assets. Major portions of the fixed assets of PC2 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
PC3 were initially recorded at cost. With the introduction of a market-oriented economic system in&#13;
1989, the Government revalued all the operating assets of the PCs (para. 3.18). The fixed assets of all&#13;
PCs were restated based on the price index stipulated by the Government in January 1990 and January&#13;
1992. PC2's net revalued fixed assets for 1993 amounted to D 4,028 billion and were only slightly&#13;
increased from FY92 levels, despite the revaluation. PC3, had net revalued fixed assets in FY92 of D&#13;
672 billion, which dropped slightly in FY93 to D 630 billion. PC2 and PC3 recorded substantial&#13;
increase in their fixed assets under construction of about 83% and 55%, respectively, in FY93&#13;
reflecting their expansion activities. PC2 recorded a 5.4% rate of return on average net fixed assets in&#13;
operation in FY93, while PC3 had a negative return. However, due to the high rates of inflation&#13;
experienced in Viet Nam over the past four years, the varying methodologies used for revaluing fixed&#13;
assets, and distortions in the value of fixed assets, computations of annual rates of return, can be&#13;
misleading.&#13;
C. Financial Outlook&#13;
5.9        To address the vulnerable condition of the PCs and achieve financial recovery, a re-&#13;
capitalization of the PCs equity with the aim of rebuilding, fully funding, and strengthening the capital&#13;
base, and to focus on improving liquidity without charging distorted tariffs, is necessary. In order to&#13;
improve the PCs' financial performance, and help them self-finance a substantial portion of the&#13;
investment program, the PCs would need to retain depreciation expenses. In 1994, the Government has&#13;
decided to discontinue the requirement of remitting regular depreciation charges starting 1995. This&#13;
Government initiative, however, will not completely improve the PCs' capital structure unless infusion&#13;
of new Government equity is made.  The financial projections, therefore, assumes that future&#13;
investments will be financed through a combination of loans and fresh Government contributions.&#13;
Specific operating and financial covenants designed to directly support the objectives of financial&#13;
viability and mobilization of resources for development, are being sought under the proposed project.&#13;
The covenants provided in paras. 5.11-5.17 are designed to prevent further erosion of the capital base,&#13;
ensure that part of the profits would be available to meet future financing requirements, and safeguard&#13;
that internally generated funds will be available to meet operating and debt servicing requirements.&#13;
5.10       Projections of PC2's and PC3's financial performance for the period 1994-2000, together&#13;
with assumptions underlying these projections, are presented in Annexes 18 through 20. A summary of&#13;
the financial projections is presented in Table 5.3.&#13;
5.11       On the basis of load forecasts approved by the Government for planning the sector's&#13;
development, PC2's retail sales are expected to grow on average at 14% from 4,329 Gwh in FY94 to&#13;
9,030 Gwh in FY2000. Revenues from the sale of power are projected to increase from D 2,359&#13;
billion to D 9,761 billion for the same period. Fuel costs are estimated to increase by 10% in each of&#13;
the years: 1996, 1998 and 2000. The financial projections show that with reasonable tariff increases in&#13;
line with the Government's intent to raise the cost of electricity to an average of 7 USc/kWh by 1999,&#13;
PC2's performance is expected to remain satisfactory, with operating expenses remaining at about 70%&#13;
to 80% of operating revenues. The projections also indicate that during the period, PC2 might be able&#13;
to finance an average of about 35% of its future investment from internal sources. However, given&#13;
certain weaknesses in PC2's financial accounts and the sensitivity of the financial projections to the&#13;
Government's pricing of electricity tariffs and the timing of these increases, a lower self financing ratio&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

is covenanted. Agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC2 that they would take&#13;
all actions, including but not limited to adjustment of tariffs, so that PC2 would generate funds from&#13;
internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual average of PC2's capital expenditures&#13;
incurred for that financial year, the previous financial year, and the next following financial year.&#13;

5.12        PC3's future finances are precarious and the situation is exacerbated by incorporating on&#13;
its books the capital and operating costs of the 700 MW Yali Hydropower project whose benefits would&#13;
begin to flow in the next century. For the purpose of this analysis, Yali has been removed from the&#13;
financial projections. In addition, the following assumptions are made: (a) the price at which PC3&#13;
purchases power from PCI and PC2 would remain at the current level of D 5/kWh; and (b) the&#13;
Government would: (i) waive payment of the tax on capital in 1995; (ii) levy tax on capital in&#13;
progressively increasing amounts during 1996-1998 to achieve zero net income; and (iii) levy the full&#13;
tax on capital and on income from  1999 onwards.  With the load forecasts approved by the&#13;
Government, PC3's retail sales are expected to increase from 742 Gwh in FY94 to 1,498 Gwh in&#13;
FY2000 or an average increase of about 13% p.a. Revenues from the sale of power are projected to&#13;
increase from D 352 billion to D 1,411 billion from FY94 to FY2000, while fuel costs are assumed to&#13;
increase by 10% in FY96, FY98 and FY2000. The projections show that in FY94 and FY95, revenues&#13;
per kWh of D 475 and D 539 will not be enough to offset operating costs per kWh of D 593 and D&#13;
579, respectively, due to increasing costs of operating and depreciating a rapidly expanding system and&#13;
will result in operating losses during the period. PC3 will experience net operating losses of about D&#13;
88 billion in FY94 and D 40 billion in FY95. However, as revenues per kWh are gradually increased&#13;
and as expenses per kWh are held to reasonable levels, PC3 will realize operating income from FY96&#13;
onwards.  To ensure that PC3 achieves viable operations, it was agreed at negotiations that the&#13;
Borrower and PC3 would take all necessary measures including but not limited to adjusting tariffs, so&#13;
as to enable PC3, from FY96 and thereafter, to realize operating revenues that would be sufficient to&#13;
cover all operating costs including depreciation. This would be on the basis of the aforementioned&#13;
assumptions regarding Yali, the cost of purchased power and the levy of tax on capital.&#13;

5.14       In the past, PC2 and PC3 have not borrowed long term funds since all funds have been&#13;
provided through the Government budget. The projections, however, assume that a bigger portion of&#13;
future investments will be financed through loans until a satisfactory capitalization of the power sector&#13;
is achieved. The assumptions on the future capital structure are: (a) in order to maintain a manageable&#13;
level of debt servicing, the existing Government capital will remain as equity and will not be&#13;
transformed into debt; (b) beginning 1994, new investments will be financed with one third new cash&#13;
Government contributions in the form of equity and two thirds debt.&#13;
5.15       Total investments including IDC of PC2 and PC3 for 1994-2000 are projected at D 32,121&#13;
billion (US$2.9 billion) and D 9,298 billion (US$845 million), respectively. PC2's investments are&#13;
expected to grow considerably at an average rate of about 36% during 1994-2000, while investments of&#13;
PC3 are projected to grow by 15% p.a. from FY94-97 and drop sharply by 53% thereafter. PC2 and&#13;
PC3 will secure long term financing, net of debt service, for about D 18,593 billion and D 4,678&#13;
billion, respectively, of projected 1994-2000 investments. These borrowings represent adequate capital&#13;
structures for PC2 and PC3 with long term debts not exceeding 46% and 37% of total capitalization,&#13;
respectively, for the projected period. While PC2 is expected to achieve a significant level of self&#13;
financing averaging about 35% throughout the projected period, PC3's net internal cash generation&#13;
would not be sufficient to cover investments, as its internal cash net of debt service would contribute&#13;
only about 7% on average to investments.&#13;
5.16       PC2's debt service coverage in the past has been adequate because borrowings have not&#13;
been a significant source of financing. The financial projections show that with the restructuring of&#13;
PC2's capital base and implementation of adequate tariffs, the debt service coverage would be between&#13;
2.8 times to 41.7 times during the projected period. With a view to maintaining debt service at&#13;
acceptable levels, agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC2 that PC2 would&#13;
not incur additional debt unless a reasonable forecast shows that its estimated internally generated cash,&#13;
after expenditure for each year, during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5 times its&#13;
total estimated debt service requirements in such years, including the debt to be incurred.&#13;
5.17       The bulk of PC3's project construction will be carried out in FY94-97 and about 71% of&#13;
the capital investment will be made in these years. PC3 will have no further major capital expenditures&#13;
beyond 1997 and will not require any cash generation except for meeting debt service and working&#13;
capital requirements. PC3's long term loans would require debt service payments of D 995 billion over&#13;
the projected period. The financial projections show that PC3's internal cash generation (operating&#13;
profit less income tax plus depreciation), before debt service, would be about D 2,133 billion which&#13;
would enable PC3 to service its debt from its internal sources without recourse to additional borrowing.&#13;
PC3's debt service coverage is estimnated to be negative in PY94 but will increase to 10.2 times in&#13;
FY95 and gradually decline to a normal level as debt servicing to finance expenditures commences from&#13;
FY96. Agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC3 that PC3 would in each year&#13;
beginning FY95, achieve a debt service coverage of not less than 1.3 times in respect of its operations.&#13;

CHAPTER VI&#13;
Project Justification&#13;
A. Economic Analysis&#13;
6.1        Development of the power sector is crucial for the economic upliftment of Viet Nam.&#13;
Implementation of the proposed project would help ensure the country's continued economic growth.&#13;
While providing the much needed capital for investment, the project would make a significant&#13;
contribution towards improving the efficiency of the power sector, in terms of reducing fuel costs,&#13;
reducing losses and improving system operation and control - all proven measures to achieve benefits at&#13;
the lowest cost. Other project benefits would be strengthening of the power sector institutions, preparing&#13;
them to handle efficiently the requirements of a rapidly growing system, and moving them towards&#13;
market-oriented approaches.&#13;
Conversion of Ba Ria Open Cycle Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation&#13;
6.2        Although the commissioning of the 500 kV North-South link has temporarily eased power&#13;
shortages in the South, the rapid demand growth is expected to put renewed pressure on generating&#13;
capacity within the next 2-3 years. An assessment of PC2's generation requirements by consultants&#13;
shows the need for addition of base load capacity in PC2's system by 1996-1997. Even with the&#13;
addition of 57 MW steam capacity at Ba Ria (proposed under the project), the system reserve would be&#13;
insufficient to back up the 500 kV link and load shedding can be expected at times when the link fails.&#13;
6.3        The availability of offshore gas at Ba Ria from mid 1995 at a price of about US$2.0 per&#13;
MMBTU (economic cost about US$1.3 per MMBTU) strengthens the justification for converting Ba Ria&#13;
to a base load station. An assessment of the annuitized costs of different options for capacity additions&#13;
(conversion of open cycle turbines to combined cycle operation, new open cycle capacity, new&#13;
combined cycle capacity - Annex 21) shows that the least-cost alternative is the conversion of three 37.5&#13;
MW turbines to combined cycle operation, by adding a 57 MW steam cycle.&#13;
6.4        The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated for the least-cost option&#13;
assuming the plant running at an annual capacity factor of 68% for an economic life of 20 years. All&#13;
monetary costs and benefits are in 1994 prices. Because of the liberalized nature of foreign exchange in&#13;
Viet Nam, no adjustments are made for the shadow exchange rate. A conversion factor of 0.75 is&#13;
assumed for expenditure on labor to remove distortions of subsidies and taxes. The incremental sales&#13;
(after duly allowing for all losses) represent the benefits of the project; these are valued at tariffs&#13;
progressively reaching 7 USc/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. The cost streams consist&#13;
of the capital expenditure (foreign - US$62.82 million; local - US$6.26 million) and the annual&#13;
operation and maintenance costs of US$1.73 million (2.5% of capital cost). As the steam turbine will&#13;
use waste heat, there is no incremental fuel cost. The EIRR is computed at 18.0% (details are at&#13;
Annex 21). A 10% increase in capital costs reduces the EIRR to 16.3%. If the tariff is maintained at&#13;
the present level of about 5 USc/kWh, the EIRR falls to 14.0%. Finally, a 12% reduction in output&#13;
(unlikely, given PC2's needs for energy and its ability to run the plant at the assumed capacity factor)&#13;
reduces the EIRR to 15.5%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
6.5        The EIRR thus calculated understates the benefits to the economy, as consumer surplus&#13;
(benefit derived by consumers over and above the price for electricity) is not included. Inclusion of&#13;
consumer surplus would result in a higher EIRR, largely independent of the tariff; a lower tariff would&#13;
simply transfer the benefit from PC2 to the consumers.&#13;
Rehabilitation and Expansion of HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang Distribution Networks&#13;
6.6        The existing distribution networks in HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang are old, unreliable and&#13;
overloaded, and incur high losses (paras. 4.5, 4.7, 4.9). With the forecast rapid increase in demands,&#13;
the power companies would need to make large investments in rehabilitating the old network&#13;
components, in expanding the networks to new areas and in connecting new consumers. Part of the&#13;
reason that sales are expected to increase so rapidly is that there is substantial pent-up demand because&#13;
of shortages in generating capacity.  Detailed feasibility studies for upgrading these distribution&#13;
networks have been conducted by consultants. These studies consider: (a) the forecast demand growths;&#13;
(b) the investment requirements over the next several years for meeting the forecast demands while&#13;
upgrading the networks to acceptable levels of safety and reliability; and (c) estimates of progressive&#13;
reductions in losses and improvements in reliability (expressed in terms of unserved energy due to&#13;
outages). The following methodology is used for evaluating the EIRR for the distribution rehabilitation&#13;
and expansion projects.&#13;
6.7         The analysis assumes two scenarios: (a) "with project"; and (b) "without project". The&#13;
"with project" scenario is based on incurring the full investments (in the distribution systems and&#13;
upstream sub-transmission) for meeting the forecast demands and a progressive reduction in losses and&#13;
unserved energy. The "without project" scenario assumes that the system would be able to meet the&#13;
full forecast demand growth with zero investments but with progressive increase in losses and unserved&#13;
energy. The "without project" scenario makes the unrealistic (but overly conservative) assumption that&#13;
the existing system would be able to meet the demand growth. Incremental operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) costs are conservatively assumed to be the same for both the scenarios, although in the "without&#13;
project" scenario these would be much higher. The following are the main assumptions:&#13;
(a)   all costs are expressed in constant 1994 prices, making no adjustments for shadow&#13;
exchange rate and using a conversion factor of 0.75 for labor costs;&#13;
(b)  the capital investment is considered over the 1994-2000 time slice (part of which would be&#13;
funded by the proposed project);&#13;
(c)  the analysis is made over a project economic life of 25 years, with no increases in sales or&#13;
losses or improvements in reliability after 2000;&#13;
(d)  the average retail sales tariff is assumed to increase from the current level of about 5&#13;
USc/kWh to 7 USc/kWh in 1999 as proposed by the Government;&#13;
(e)  the LRMC of supply to the subtransmission level is assumed at 5 USc/kWh based on the&#13;
Bank's Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review (Report No. 10842-VN);&#13;
(f)   unserved energy is very conservatively evaluated at 10 times the tariff level;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
(g)  the technical losses are valued at the LRMC of supply at the subtransmission level (non-&#13;
technical losses are not considered in the economic evaluation); and&#13;
(h)  the EIRR of the project is the discount rate at which the present value of the cost streams&#13;
of the "with project" and "without project" scenarios are equal.&#13;
6.8        The details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 21. To test the robustness of&#13;
the EIRR for the base case, sensitivities are undertaken, relating to forecast demand growth, capital and&#13;
O&amp;M costs and the valuation of unserved energy. The resulting EIRRs are tabulated below:&#13;
EIRR %&#13;
Case                                          HCMC        Hue        Nhatranz&#13;
Base                                          55.6%       20.3%      29.0%&#13;
Capital costs increased by 10%                51.8%       18.0%      26.0%&#13;
Demand reduced by 10%                         47.9%       16.1%      23.6%&#13;
Unserved energy valued at 5 times the tariff  51.3%       16.7%      23.7%&#13;
6.9         The results indicate robust EIRRs for all the distribution projects; the results for HCMC&#13;
being much higher than those for Hue and Nhatrang in view of the large power demand in this&#13;
metropolis. The EIRRs are likely to be underestimates because of the conservative assumptions made&#13;
about the unserved energy (both in terms of its magnitude and its evaluation) and other factors.&#13;
Load Dispatch Centers&#13;
6.10       This project component envisages the construction of Regional Load Dispatch centers for&#13;
PC1, PC2 and PC3, and strengthening of the National Load Dispatch Center. The investments are&#13;
vital; these centers will allow the introduction of SCADA and EMS systems to Viet Nam, and allow the&#13;
automation of system control and dispatch procedures that are currently performed manually. The&#13;
benefits are indeed large, but are difficult to quantify; an attempt is nevertheless made to evaluate an&#13;
order of magnitude of returns that could be expected out of the project. Since these centers will be&#13;
operated jointly to control an integrated system, it is appropriate to estimate the economic returns&#13;
jointly, rather than for each individual control center.&#13;
6.11       The benefits that can be expected to arise are: (a) improved system efficiency as a result of&#13;
better dispatch of generating plant; (b) reduction in fault clearance times on transmission lines and&#13;
consequent reduction in unserved energy due to transmission faults; (c) reduced staff numbers due to&#13;
automation of processes currently performed manually; and (d) improved quality of supply due to&#13;
reduction in the amount of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems and voltage stabilizer equipment&#13;
purchased in the country by industry. The PCs will also be able to collect data on the operating&#13;
performance of their system far more efficiently than before, which will assist their short and long term&#13;
planning efforts; this benefit has not however been quantified. It should be noted that some of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
benefits (for example improved frequency control) will only be realized if there is disciplined grid&#13;
operation and a reasonable margin of capacity over demand.&#13;
6.12       The cost streams are the investmnent in the load dispatch centers and the annual O&amp;M&#13;
costs, assumed at 2% of the investment. The benefits are calculated assuming: (a) an efficiency gain of&#13;
0.5% on energy generation; (b) a reduction of 20% in the volume of unserved energy due to&#13;
transmission line faults; and (c) a reduction in the purchase of UPS and voltage stabilizer equipment&#13;
equivalent to 0.1% of peak demand by the end of the project. The EIRR is estimated to be 27%;&#13;
details of the assumptions and computation are at Annex 21. Decreasing by half the benefits from a&#13;
reduction in unserved energy and in the purchase of UPS equipment produces an EIRR of 20.3%.&#13;
Energy efficiency savings alone produce an EIRR of 11.0%.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.13       The project faces the following potential risks: First, delay in meeting the level of demand&#13;
growth to maintain the project's economic viability, due to delays in securing counterpart funds;&#13;
Second, delays in project implementation due to: (i) teething problems of working with international&#13;
financial institutions; and (ii) unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The risk of demand&#13;
not materializing as forecast is low, as the project focuses on areas of high potential growth. The risk&#13;
of undue delays in project implementation has been minimized by extensive preparation work,&#13;
institutional strengthening measures and substantive consulting assistance in project detailed design and&#13;
construction supervision. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would take&#13;
necessary steps to secure the funds needed for undertaking the project components.&#13;
&#13;

farming community at rates that have been mutually agreed upon (para. 4.29);&#13;
(i)  take all measures necessary to enable PC2 to generate funds from internal sources&#13;
equivalent to 25 % of its annual average investment for three years (para. 5.11);&#13;
(j)  take all measures necessary to enable PC3 to realize satisfactory operating ratios (para.&#13;
5.12);&#13;
(k)   PC2 would achieve a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 (para. 5.16); and&#13;
(1)   PC3 would achieve a debt service ratio of not less than 1.3 (para. 5.17).&#13;
7.3        The finalization of subsidiary loan agreements between the Borrower and PC2 and PC3,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit (para. 4.31). The approval&#13;
of Phase-2 RAPs by IDA and the Borrower would be a condition for disbursement under the IDA credit&#13;
for expenditures incurred against the distribution systems sub-components of the project components&#13;
(para. 4.27).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
7.4        On the basis of the aforementioned agreements, the proposed project is suitable for an IDA&#13;
credit of SDR 110.6 million (US$165 million equivalent) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on&#13;
IDA's standard terms with a maturity of 40 years.&#13;

The Power Companies No. 1 and No. 3 were established under similar decrees with the same contents.&#13;
PC3 was established on October 7, 1975 as a "connecting link" between PCI and PC2 and was taken&#13;
over from the French Company of SIPEA. PCl's original name was "Company of the North".&#13;
With Resolution No. 15-DL/TCCB3 of May 9, 1981 the power companies were named Power&#13;
Company No.1 (in the North), Power Company No.2 (in the South) and Power Company No.3 (in the&#13;
Center).&#13;
RESOLUTION No.388-HDBT&#13;
(Hanoi, the 20th of November 1991)&#13;
Under Resolution No. 388-HDBT - it is a "Temporary Resolution and the intention is, to pass a&#13;
regular law to this effect in the future - all State Enterprises, including those dealing with electric&#13;
power, had to apply for re-registration. The purpose of this procedure was to review the very large&#13;
number of State Enterprises, which had accumulated over the years, with a view to determining whether&#13;
they would be economically viable under the regime of an Open Market Policy. Following guidelines&#13;
were applied in determining viability:&#13;
1.   Companies had to be in a position to operate in the sector they had been operating before.&#13;
2.   Prospects had to be good for preserving and maintaining the capital entrusted to them by the&#13;
State.&#13;
3.   They had to be in a position to carry out the duties and responsibilities entrusted to them by the&#13;
State.&#13;
4.   Adequate staffing and a suitable organization had to be in place.&#13;
5.   The companies had to be in a position to preserve their assets and to satisfy their market.&#13;
In the case of the power companies, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) had to submit the application for re-&#13;
registration.&#13;
The process of re-registration was originally envisaged as follows:&#13;
1.   Enterprises with a considerable amount of assets)"&#13;
(a)   Review by the Chairman of the Planning Commission.&#13;
(b)   Decision by the Prime Minister.&#13;
I1 No definision was given on what constitutes a 'Considerable Amount of Assets".&#13;

2.   "Smaller" amount of assets&#13;
(a) For centrally-owned companies the Chairman of the Planning Commission was to decide&#13;
on re-registration of State Enterprises.&#13;
(b)   For provincially-owned companies the Minister of Economics was to decide on re-&#13;
registration of State Enterprises.&#13;
After approval of the re-registration, a company had to register with the Government ("economic&#13;
authority") within 60 days. After this registration the State Enterprise acquired its status of a new&#13;
juridical entity. Within 7 days after registration the "economic authority" had to send the necessary&#13;
papers to the tax authorities, to the Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of Statistics.&#13;
Within 30 days of registration the State Enterprise had to announce in the official gazette - on five&#13;
consecutive days - the particulars of its juridical person, such as name, headquarters, name of bank&#13;
connection and account number, date of start of operations, sector of operations, etc.&#13;
Subsequently,&#13;
RESOLUTION No.393/CT&#13;
(Hanoi, the 25th of November 1991)&#13;
was published and stipulated the following:&#13;
All State Enterprises, for which it has been decided that they be abolished, must discontinue operation&#13;
during the first quarter of 1992. Those which remain under new registry must be re-established by the&#13;
end of the second quarter 1992. By January 31, 1992 all State Enterprises had to report their intention&#13;
to re-register. They have to carry a new seal.&#13;
RESOLUTION No. 156/HDBT&#13;
ADDENDUM TO RESOLUTION No. 388-HDBT&#13;
(Hanoi, the 7th of May 1992)&#13;
In modification of Resolution No. 388, it was decreed that, before reviewing a State Enterprise, a&#13;
SELECTION COMMITTEE has to be established. Unlike in the basic resolution where the Prime&#13;
Minister decides about a State Company's re-registration after recommendation by the Chairman of the&#13;
State Planning Commission, the Prime Minister decides, in the case of a comnpany with sizeable amount&#13;
of assets, on the recommendation of the Selection Committee (the Committee consists of the State&#13;
Planning Conunission and members of the Ministry concerned). In the case of smaller enterprises with&#13;

The production and consumption of electricity in the country is regulated with the following directive:&#13;
DIRECTIVE No. 80-HDBT&#13;
ON SUPPLY AND USE OF POWER&#13;
(Hanoi, the 18th of July 1983)&#13;
I.    GENERAL&#13;
HI.   Conditions of Supply and Use of Power&#13;
A.   Regulation&#13;
B.   Basic technical conditions, such as cosphi, capacity factor, etc.&#13;
C.   Meter reading&#13;
D.   Invoicing and Control&#13;
m.  Area of Control of Power Facilities. The relevant paragraphs cover the subject of electric power&#13;
from generation to consumption.&#13;
IV.  Responsibilities and Limitations of Supply. Basically, the power companies are required to offer&#13;
safe, uninterrupted supply. In case of major maintenance requirements, customers must be&#13;
notified 10 days in advance. In case of emergency, PCs have access to any premise at anytime.&#13;
By breach of a supply contract, a monetary compensation of five times the electricity not&#13;
provided is foreseen; the same applies to damages caused by voltage surges. Force majeure is,&#13;
of course, excluded.&#13;
V.   Responsibilities of Users. Resale of electricity is basically not allowed. Repair of power facilities&#13;
is exclusively the responsibility of the power companies. Theft of electricity is a criminal&#13;
offense.&#13;

Billing and Collection System&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Power Company no. 2 (PC2) and Power Company no. 3 (PC3) have 19 and 11 power&#13;
service subsidiaries, respectively, located in different provinces. Depending on its physical size, each&#13;
province also has a number of collection branches. PC2 services approximately 700,000 customers out&#13;
of a total population of about 28 million in an area covering 22% of the country. PC3 services 158,270&#13;
customers out of total population of approximately 11 million in an area covering 33 % of the country.&#13;
B. Metering&#13;
2.           PC2 and PC3 meter reading procedures are similar. Meter readers, who report to the&#13;
head of the power service subsidiary, play an important role in the process of recording the usage of&#13;
power. All new meter readers go through a short training course. They need to be meticulous and&#13;
must possess legible handwriting.&#13;
3.           A meter reader has the following records:&#13;
(a)    Meter Card: this card, which is replaced every 4 years in the case of PC2, is attached&#13;
to the meter;&#13;
(b)    Consunmtion Report: this report, furnished by the computer centers of PC2 and PC3,&#13;
provides customer information such as the name and address, type of business, previous&#13;
consumption, current consumption, etc. At each power service subsidiary, the report is&#13;
assigned to the meter reader on a daily basis at the start of a working day and in&#13;
accordance with a schedule of meter reading. The meter reader visits the customers&#13;
following the order of information provided on the report. At the end of the day, the&#13;
meter reader reports back to the supervisor and submits the following: (i) consumption&#13;
report; (ii) letters of grievances from customers; (iii) report on addresses which could&#13;
not be found; and (iv) report on notices left at the places of absent customers.&#13;
4.           Meter reading is done once every month, usually on the same day of the month. In&#13;
addition, the meter reader is responsible for: (a) comparing the current consumption of power against&#13;
the previous period; (b) reporting defective meters; and (c) reporting theft of power.&#13;
5.           In urban areas, meter readers read an average of 70 meters each day. At the end of the&#13;
day, they bring back the consumption reports to the power service subsidiary to have the data entered&#13;
by the staff of the computer center. In rural areas, they read about 30 meters each day and bring back&#13;
the consumption reports every five or six days to the power service subsidiary.&#13;

consumption of electricity; and (b) invoices produced in the month following the consumption period.&#13;
7.              The Data Processing Center, located in Ho Chi Minh City, is responsible for this&#13;
process which is generated using a Bull mainframe with an older IBM mainframe as a back-up. The 19&#13;
power service subsidiaries submit the following information to the Data Processing Center: (a)&#13;
consumption diskettes: (data from the consumption reports are entered and stored on diskettes by the&#13;
computer staff at the power service subsidiaries); (b) notices on new customers; (c) notices on&#13;
customers who have terminated their contracts with PC2; and (d) notices of changes such as customers'&#13;
names, new meters.&#13;
8.              The power service subsidiaries reviews the data carefully before submitting them to the&#13;
Data Processing Center which then coordinates with the Commerce Department who verifies the data&#13;
before processing them. Information is submitted in accordance with a pre-arranged schedule between&#13;
the Data Processing Center and the power service subsidiaries. For the Ho Chi Minh City power&#13;
service subsidiary, the Data Processing Center follows a 24-day cycle of producing invoices for&#13;
residential customers and an 8 day-cycle for non-residential customers.&#13;

12.             The collection system includes the following:&#13;
(a)     A  Mobile Collection Unit which is comprised of supervisors and mobile collectors.&#13;
Every morning, before going on their route, the mobile collectors are assigned a&#13;
number of invoices together with a list of customers. At the end of the day, they report&#13;
back to the supervisor the following: (i) the arnount collected from customers or the&#13;
bank receipts in the case where the mobile collectors deposit directly their collections&#13;
into PC2's account at the bank; (ii) the stubs of invoices (third detachable portion)&#13;
already paid by customers; and (iii) the invoices for customers who are absent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
(b)    A Branch Collection Unit comprised of supervisors, bill controllers, and branch&#13;
collectors. If customers are absent, the mobile collectors leave a notice (first detachable&#13;
portion) to the customers to pay at the nearest branch. At the end of the day, the&#13;
branch collectors remit the collections to the supervisor or deposit them directly into&#13;
PC2's bank account. The bill controllers keep track of the list of customers whose&#13;
power service may be discontinued due to overdue payments.&#13;
(c)    A Bank Collection Unit responsible for collections done through auto-payments,&#13;
payment authorizations, and checks.&#13;
(d)    A Bill-Cancellation and Follow-Up Unit which follows up on the payment and non-&#13;
payment of each invoice and cancels the paid invoices from its books. It coordinates&#13;
with the bill controllers and the bill collectors in cases of extended overdue payments.&#13;
(e)    A Receivables Unit responsible for controlling the receipts and expenses. It reports the&#13;
movements of entries to and from PC2's bank account.&#13;
13.           On average, it takes one week between the time the meter reader visits the customer and&#13;
the time the mobile collector delivers the electricity bill to the customer. The customer has to pay the&#13;
bill within eight days. If the bill is not paid within eight days, the mobile collector leaves another&#13;
notice at the customer's place, giving the customer a grace period of one t6 three days to pay his bill&#13;
before the service is discontinued. The mobile collector returns for a third time to the customer's place&#13;
to collect the bill within that time limit. If he is unsuccessful, the bill controllers will issue an order to&#13;
the customers' service to disconnect the service within 24 hours for residential customers and within&#13;
three days for non-residential customers.&#13;
Power Company No. 3&#13;
14.           Mobile collectors deliver the electricity bills to the customers following a routing&#13;
schedule. If the customers are not present, the collectors leave behind a notice (first detachable portion&#13;
of the bill). The customers have to pay the bills within five days. If the bills are not paid within that&#13;
time limit, the collectors deliver a second notice indicating that the power service will be disconnected&#13;
if the bills are not paid within three days. The mobile collectors return to collect from the customers a&#13;
third time within that time limit. If the collection is unsuccessful, power service will be disconnected&#13;
within 24 hours for residential customers and within three to five days for non-residential customers.&#13;
15.           At the end of every day, the collections from the power service subsidiaries and from&#13;
the collection branches are deposited into the bank accounts of PC3 in the provinces. Deposits from&#13;
main collection branches are transferred from bank branches to PC3's main bank account in Da Nang&#13;
each day. Deposits from smaller collection branches are transferred only every three days. Unpaid&#13;
invoices are usually from state enterprises which have been dissolved and especially from agricultural&#13;
provinces experiencing bad harvest. Under these special circumstances, PC3 may continue to provide&#13;
power and request the State to recognize the bad debt. For example in February 1994, the State wrote-&#13;
off a bad debt amounting to D 300 million carried by PC3 for the agricultural province of Quang Binh.&#13;

16.          The methods of payment to PC2 and PC3 are as follows:&#13;
(a)    Cash collected from the customers either at their residences or at the collection&#13;
branches. This method is the most popular among residential customers.&#13;
(b)    Auto-Payment which is initiated by the customer's bank for the benefit of PC2 and PC3&#13;
usually on the same date of the month and upon receipt of the electricity bill. This&#13;
method of payment is specified in the contract between the customers and the power&#13;
companies. This method is exclusively for corporate customers who have stable&#13;
earnings.&#13;
(c)    Pavment Authorization where the customer issues a payment authorization to PC2 and&#13;
PC3 to collect at the customer's bank. This method is used by most of the companies.&#13;

Power Sector Reform and Restructuring&#13;
Terms of Reference for ESMAP Technical Assistance&#13;
A. Background &amp; Project Objectives&#13;
1.         The Government of Vietnam is currently developing proposals for a major structural&#13;
change in the power sector. On January 1, 1995, the govermnent created The General Company of&#13;
Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number 562/Ttg, dated October 10, 1995. The General Company is&#13;
an independent juridical entity with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter&#13;
of EVN laying out the exact scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries under it, is&#13;
yet to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and&#13;
legal entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The Ministry of&#13;
Energy has developed a draft charter that is under review and discussion by the Government of&#13;
Vietnam.&#13;
2.         The objective of this technical assistance activity are to assist the Government in the&#13;
following tasks:&#13;
(a)   Defining the structural and implementation details for the sector transformation under&#13;
EVN. This will involve the clarification of the applicable principles and organizational&#13;
options for sector reform and modernization to achieve the Government's objective of&#13;
moving the administration of the power sector from central planning mechanism to those&#13;
that are more market oriented.&#13;
(b)   Preparation of a draft grid code that would allow for the integrated and reliable operation&#13;
of the transmission system, and also facilitate increased operational efficiency.&#13;
(c)   Define the requirements for the legal and regulatory framework based on the proposed&#13;
sector structure that are necessary to separate the distinct roles of asset ownership,&#13;
enterprise management and sector regulation. The government currently performs all&#13;
three functions without the necessary arms-length separation. While the government&#13;
would continue to perform a large part of these functions in the medium-term, the need&#13;
for a credible regulatory framework has been recognized. This legal and regulatory&#13;
framework would also assist in the paving the ways for future private sector involvement&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
3.         The technical assistance would be conducted in a participatory, interactive environment by&#13;
means of Action Planning Sessions/Workshops under the guidance of a Steering Committee and the&#13;
participation of a Working Group of commnitted working-level Vietnamese counterparts from the various&#13;
Government Ministries, the State Planning Committee, the Institute of Energy and the three existing&#13;
power companies.&#13;

B. Scope of Work&#13;
4.         This technical assistance will be provided in an interactive environment that is responsive&#13;
to the priority needs of the Vietnamese Government, at a time when major reforms are under&#13;
consideration and implementation. A Vietnamese Working Group comprised of about 15 experts from&#13;
the different entities in the power sector will be established to work with the ESMAP team on a day-to-&#13;
day basis. A series of presentations, discussion and action planning workshops will be used to facilitate&#13;
this interaction. A Steering Committee comprised of members from key government ministries an&#13;
agencies will oversee the technical assistance.&#13;
5.         A study tour to UK, France, Malaysia and China will be organized to allow members of&#13;
the Working Group and other Vietnamese officials to evaluate first-hand the institutional structures in&#13;
place in these countries, as well as to hold discussions with officials in these countries to gain an&#13;
appreciation for the implementation challenges.&#13;
6.         In May 1995, a Workshop will be held in Vietnam, where the Working Groups will&#13;
present their recommendations to high-level policy makers from the Vietnamese Government. The&#13;
Workshop will include international experts who will provide their views on the recommendations made&#13;
by the Working Group.&#13;
7.         During the interactive sessions with the Working Group the ESMAP team will be prepared&#13;
to discuss and provide advice in the following topics:&#13;
(a)   objective of reform;&#13;
(b)   overview of power sector reform: reasons for reform, reform as a process;&#13;
(c)   framework for understanding power sector reform: modes of ownership and control,&#13;
vertical integration of activities, competition and monopoly, industry concentration,&#13;
international experience;&#13;
(d)   structural options for power sector organization: key issues concerning structural reform,&#13;
general principles concerning structural reform;&#13;
(e)  the process of enterprise reform: commercialization and corporatization of the power&#13;
entities, sequencing and transitional arrangements;&#13;
(f)   key issues in gauging financial performance of the sector.  Options for diversifying&#13;
financing for power sector development;&#13;
(g)   key issues in legal and regulatory reform. Relationship of regulatory reform to structural&#13;
reform; and&#13;
(h)   reforms to facilitate private sector participation in the sector.&#13;

8.         This activity will be supervised and coordinated by a "Steering Committee" of high-level&#13;
Vietnamese officials from all agencies involved in the power sector reform process, including but not&#13;
limited to the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, the Institute of Energy (MOE), the State&#13;
Planning Committee including representation from the Department of Enterprise Reform, the State&#13;
Committee on Pricing, and from the Reform Committee under the Government's Office. The Steering&#13;
Committee will oversee this technical assistance activity.&#13;
9.         A Working Group of about 15 Vietnamese experts will be formed by the Steering&#13;
Committee. The Working Group will be responsible for the daily interaction with the ESMAP team.&#13;
The Chairman of the Working Group will be responsible to the Steering Committee and keep them&#13;
abreast of the progress of work.  For the Working Group, it would be appropriate to have&#13;
representation from the three power Companies: PCI, PC2 and PC3; from the Power Investigation and&#13;
Design Company No. 1 (PIDCI); the Institute of Energy and from the MOE.&#13;
10.        To prepare for the discussions with the ESMAP team the Working Group will collect&#13;
material relevant to the reform effort in the power sector and prepare a Background Paper. The&#13;
Background Paper will also articulate the Government's reform objectives, and clarify the current&#13;
institutional and policy directions. During the extended first interactive session with the Working&#13;
Group (3-weeks in February 1995), the ESMAP team will prepare presentations and written material in&#13;
topics/areas as required by the Working Group and the ESMAP Task Manager.&#13;
1.         The Government will be responsible for the selection of participants to the Study Tour. In&#13;
this regard, it is important to select the appropriate participants so that upon return they would be&#13;
empowered to act on the experiences and the lessons learned during the Study Tour, The ESMAP team&#13;
will assist in making arrangements if deemed necessary for the study tour which best provided for the&#13;
substantive needs and interests of the Vietnamese experts.&#13;
12.        The Working Group with the assistance of the ESMAP team, will prepare a draft report to&#13;
be presented at the final Workshop in May 1995. This interim report will reflect their findings of the&#13;
study tour, in addition to the results of discussions with the ESMAP team. After the final Workshop,&#13;
the Working Group with the assistance of the ESMAP team will prepare a Final Report that will be&#13;
presented to the Steering Committee for further action.&#13;
13.        In particular reference to the final Workshop, it is understood that Vietnamese counterparts&#13;
are responsible for the coordination of activities in Viet Nam including inter alia venue, organization,&#13;
translation, logistics, etc. It is also understood that a strong commitment is required from the Steering&#13;
Committee and particularly by the Working Group for an extensive effort throughout this ESMAP&#13;
activity and beyond so that the recommendations as embodied in the Final Report can be put into&#13;
practice.&#13;

urban areas though it has been high in all sectors. Continued rapid growth is expected as a result of:&#13;
(a) rapid industrial growth, particularly in the south; and (b) growth in urban residential and&#13;
commercial demand, particularly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.&#13;
2.         Much of industry in Viet Nam does not utilize modem energy use technology and there&#13;
are great opportunities for savings through improving energy efficiency. However, the opportunities&#13;
for simple retrofitting may be limited in some heavy industry by the needs for major investments in new&#13;
production facilities to become internationally competitive. The capital base of Viet Nam industry is&#13;
expected to more than double in the next decade so attention is needed to ensure that Viet Nam does not&#13;
install technology which has lowest capital cost and unnecessarily high ongoing energy/electricity&#13;
demands. Attention is also required to address the rapidly increasing use of electricity in the residential&#13;
and commercial sectors. While electricity in the residential sector is largely used for lighting and&#13;
cooking, increased use of appliances can be expected with increasing living standards particularly in Ho&#13;
Chi Minh City and Hanoi.&#13;
3.         There has been very limited application of energy efficiency measures and other demand&#13;
side management activities to date, although there is a growing awareness of the need for Demand Side&#13;
Management (DSM) in government and utility circles. If the demand for electricity is not controlled,&#13;
the requirement for additional investments in the power sector will put an unbearable debt burden on the&#13;
Viet Namn economy.&#13;
Study Objectives&#13;
4.         The main objective of this study is to identify DSM components that could be considered&#13;
for financing under an IDA energy sector credit. To this end, and, with particular emphasis on the&#13;
south of the country where there are current shortfalls in supply capacity, the immediate objectives&#13;
would be to (i) identify a menu of DSM opportunities in the industrial, commercial and residential&#13;
sectors; (ii) prioritize and evaluate these DSM sector alternatives, based on their energy sector impact&#13;
and cost effectiveness; (iii) define an appropriate institutional and regulatory framework for DSM&#13;
program implementation and (iv) introduce a resource planning approach (e.g. IRP) which would permit&#13;
the cost-effective assessment of all supply and demand energy resource options.&#13;

Study Scope&#13;
Phase I: Identify DSM Opportunities&#13;
5.         Data Collection Phase I would begin with a determination of the quality of the existing&#13;
data on electricity consumption and electric appliance/equipment ownership patterns and trends by&#13;
region (e.g. north and south) in the industrial, residential and commercial sectors. Where the existing&#13;
data is inadequate, data collection and analysis surveys/audits would be designed and implemented.&#13;
6.         Institutional Capabilitv  An assessment will be carried out of major public and private&#13;
sector institutions and supporting entities in the electricity sector that would have a role in implementing&#13;
DSM/Energy Conservation Programs. This assessment would include, but not be limited to an analysis&#13;
of the organization, staffing and training requirements of the principal concerned entities to design,&#13;
implement, monitor and evaluate DSM programs; assessment of educational and technical institutes (if&#13;
available) that train architects, engineers, economists, market researchers and the potential to&#13;
introduce/strengthen energy conservation/efficiency topics in their curricula; the capability of the local&#13;
architectural and engineering community to incorporate energy efficient practices and equipment; a&#13;
determination of the local capacity to manufacture components and/or assemble energy efficient&#13;
equipment as well as manufacture complete units; the extent of tariffs, duties, import restrictions on&#13;
energy development; and the availability of equipment testing facilities in Viet Nam to assist in the&#13;
development of equipment standards and building codes.&#13;
7.         Technical Potential Assessment  Based on an analysis of the data collected, DSM&#13;
opportunities would be identified and assessed according to their technical feasibility. This menu of&#13;
DSM options must include all sectors of the economy (with particular emphasis on the industrial sector,&#13;
including processes and motors) and will examine actions that will improve the structure and efficiency&#13;
of both existing and future loads (e.g. new industrial and commercial development; new appliance&#13;
ownership in the residential and small-scale commercial sectors), and load management options that&#13;
would alleviate the need for mandatory load curtailment. Based upon generally available energy&#13;
efficient equipment and practices that are compatible with the operating characteristics of the Viet Nam&#13;
grid, an estimate will be made of the arnount of energy savings (both in terms of GWh and MW) that&#13;
could be achieved, under the assumption that there are no constraints on customer acceptance and&#13;
program imnplementation.&#13;
8.         Identification of Cost-Effective DSM Measures An estimate will be made of that portion&#13;
of the DSM technical potential identified in para. 13 above that could be achieved cost effectively. This&#13;
analysis will also take into account the existing political and cultural structures as well as regional&#13;
differences (north and south). While appropriate tests for measuring the cost-effectiveness of various&#13;
DSM measures have not yet been introduced in Viet Nam, it can be assumed that tests such as the Total&#13;
Resource Cost Test (TRC), the Utility Test and Customer Test would be used to evaluate cost&#13;
effectiveness from a variety of perspectives. This would provide the Govermunent with information to&#13;
begin to formulate feasible DSM programs and implementation arrangements.&#13;

Phase Il: Development of DSM Programs&#13;
9.         Based on the results of Phase 1, a set of possible DSM programs, consisting of one or&#13;
more cost-effective DSM measures, will be identified. Each program will then be evaluated to&#13;
determine its cost-effectiveness relative to the avoided long run marginal costs of new supply&#13;
investments. Programs will be ranked according to their relative cost-effectiveness and impact on&#13;
system demand. The next step will be to select DSM programs and determine the specific issues&#13;
involved in successful implementation of these programs in Viet Nam and how these should be&#13;
addressed to ensure the programs deliver the expected benefits and then to identify a Preliminary&#13;
Implementation Plan which will determine a broad potential timetable and plan for implementation of&#13;
the program.&#13;
Determine Institutional Needs&#13;
10.        Review the institution structures and supports required for the ongoing review and&#13;
implementation of DSM. This would include definition of a framework to best: set policies and&#13;
coordinate the program at government level; manage and implement the program; support the program&#13;
on an ongoing basis; and involve private sector in DSM activities. This component would include&#13;
coverage of: organizational structure; staffing levels and qualifications; stiff functions, qualifications&#13;
and training needs;  foreign and local technical assistance and training inputs; requirements for&#13;
implementing a methodology within the utilities for evaluation of DSM opportunities and integrated&#13;
resource planning for generation, transmission and distribution investments; and the requirements for a&#13;
review of demand forecasting approaches.&#13;
Determine Needs for Regulation&#13;
I1.        Evaluate the application of regulations for minimum efficiency codes and standards and&#13;
labelling energy intensive packaged residential, commercial and industrial equipment. Determine the&#13;
impact that this would have on local manufacture of this equipment and support that could be provided&#13;
for local firms to meet these standards. Also examine the needs for electricity tariff modifications to&#13;
ensure that economical DSM can be taken up more effectively.&#13;
Examine Financial Mechanisms for DSM&#13;
12.        Analyze funding mechanisms most suitable for Viet Nam and recommend appropriate&#13;
mechanisms for financing the program elements. Recommend allocation of funds to various program&#13;
components (such as program design; implementation hardware and operational costs, training, database&#13;
development and program evaluation etc)&#13;
Establish Monitoring, Evaluation and Database Structure&#13;
13.        Determine the most appropriate way for the establishment of an energy use database to&#13;
overcome the existing shortage of data. Recommend mechanisms for the monitoring of program&#13;
performance for each of the major DSM programs recommended.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
Evaluate Teclmology Transfer and Training Needs&#13;
14.        Determine the requirements for training and technology transfer in energy efficient&#13;
technologies in Viet Nam for both industry and commerce as well as for potential services providers.&#13;
Review the best way that these services can be provided and sustained. Address the application of&#13;
information and education programs and the best way of implementing them in Viet Nam.&#13;
15.        Determine the impact of technology intervention program on imports, the viability of local&#13;
manufacturing and potential for local technology development and manufacture, and assess the benefits&#13;
of demonstration projects.&#13;
16.        This study should provide a high level of expertise transfer of skills in DSM  policy&#13;
development and DSM program design (identification/evaluationlimplementation/monitoring).&#13;

Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project&#13;
Power Sector: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Terms of Reference for Consulting Study&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.         The Vietnamese power sector is currently  undergoing  a significant structural&#13;
transformation. This structural change would involve the creation of an umbrella power enterprise (i.e.&#13;
Electricity of Vietnam, EVN) that would supervise the operations of subordinate entities engaged in the&#13;
core activities of generation, transmission and distribution.&#13;
2.         This technical assistance (TA) project has been designed to assist the restructured entities&#13;
in meeting the operational and management challenges of this complex structural change.  The&#13;
realization of efficiency gains at the enterprise level is a key objective of the exercise. The consulting&#13;
services to be financed under this technical assistance component would develop a masterplan for&#13;
implementing internal changes in organization, and the corresponding accounting, budgeting, and&#13;
financial management systems, within the restructured power system in Viet Nnam. These changes will&#13;
reflect the principles of increasing management autonomy and accountability, and improving the flow of&#13;
cost and financial information to assist management in its operational and financial decisions.&#13;
3.         Two complementary initiatives are planned to assist the Ministry of Energy (MOE) in&#13;
restructuring the power sector, and improving the accounting systems and practices of the constituent&#13;
power entities. The first, which is currently underway, is the Power Sector Reform and Restructuring&#13;
Study. This effort is intended to assist MOE/EVN in developing a framework and sequence for&#13;
reforming the power sector. The second program of technical assistance, under ADB funding, is&#13;
intended to improve the financial and accounting systems in the power sector. To achieve the full&#13;
benefits of organizational reform and improved financial reporting and monitoring systems, it is crucial&#13;
that this technical assistance component be closely integrated with the above activities from the outset.&#13;
B. Scope of Work&#13;
4.         The overall scope of work is to develop practical and clearly defined recommendations for&#13;
organizational reforms, and the introduction of modem financial management practices and systems in&#13;
the subordinate power entities under EVN. In addressing this issue, the underlying principle is to&#13;
improve the operational efficiency and financial viability of the various business units and entities&#13;
related to EVN.&#13;
5.         In view of the need to develop a coherent approach to the intended organizational reform&#13;
and introduction of new financial and accounting management systems, the work is divided into two&#13;
phases:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-&#13;
Annex II&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
Phase 1:&#13;
6.         Development of workplan to meet the objective of Phase 2 (below) based on the outputs of&#13;
the May 1995 sector restructuring workshop, and more importantly on the final approval of the draft&#13;
charter for EVN by the Government of Viet Nam which will lay out the boundaries of the different&#13;
operational entities under EVN. This workplan will:&#13;
(a)   establish the key client working groups who will work closely with the consultants on a&#13;
day-to-day basis. The designated Vietnamese staff will be identified by the relevant&#13;
institutions and will work with the Consultant for the duration of the technical assistance&#13;
component.&#13;
(b)   outline the information requirements, and program of field visits.&#13;
(c)   develop in consultation with the ADB-funded consultant team a viable program  for&#13;
collaboration to avoid any unnecessary overlap and repetition of tasks.&#13;
Phase 2:&#13;
7.         Preparation of a Masterplan recommending appropriate organizational and management&#13;
structures of the subordinate entities under EVN. The main focus of this Masterplan would be to&#13;
recommend: (a) appropriate levels and procedures for consolidating accounting statements and balance&#13;
sheets of the subordinate power entities under EVN; (b) the organization of line and staff functions of&#13;
the newly defined entities; and (c) the operational, financial and MIS reporting requirements within and&#13;
between the new entities.&#13;
8.         As the ADB-funded technical assistance will be closely related to this phase of work, close&#13;
collaboration will be maintained at all times with the ADB funded consultant team.&#13;
The detailed scope of this masterplan is as follows:&#13;
(a)  redefinition of the functional boundaries of the different departments, work units and&#13;
subsidiaries within each independent and dependent accounting entity under EVN. This&#13;
could include the merging, separation or elimination of certain functions.&#13;
Correspondingly, this could involve the strengthening or expansion of certain functions,&#13;
e.g. financial operations at the level of EVN and the main generation and transmission&#13;
companies.&#13;
(b)   redefinition of job functions/descriptions as appropriate to fit the recommended&#13;
reorganization. The conunuication and reporting channels should also be defined.&#13;
Close working group sessions with managers and staff will be required to make sure that&#13;
the developments are totally in conformity with their needs.&#13;
(c)   redefinition of accounting units and activities, reporting requirements, formats for&#13;
information flow and frequency of such information exchange. This task will develop a&#13;
basic design for the new financial and accounting information system. It is of crucial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
importance that this basic design of the financial and accounting management information&#13;
system be totally consistent with the proposed reorganization of business processes and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
(d)   development of a financial planning system, including the introduction of operational&#13;
objectives and planned allocation of resources in the form of operating expense budgets&#13;
and capital expenditure budgets, and the frequency of issuance.&#13;
(e)  redefinition of the process of setting performance targets, and the systems for controlling&#13;
and monitoring them in practice. This would include policies and procedures, related&#13;
analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to ensure project planning, formulation,&#13;
justification, management and control of budgets, including analysis of budget variances.&#13;
It is once again of crucial importance that this be completely integrated with the&#13;
management/financial information system that is to developed.&#13;
(f)  improving the planning and control of operational support functions or central service&#13;
functions, such as, maintenance and work planning/preparation, materials management,&#13;
procurement, quality control, transportation, personnel management, etc.&#13;
(g)   preparation of a detailed scope of tasks and a clearly defined implementation strategy for&#13;
the adoption of the above recommendations. The implementation strategy will be divided&#13;
into monitorable actions and targets with a timetable. Identification and definition of&#13;
training needs and specific programs for imparting this training to the staff and&#13;
management of the different power sector entities.&#13;
9.         The TA's scope would cover the following main heads:  (a) Strategic Planning and&#13;
Organizational Structure; (b) Management Information and Budgeting Systems (MIS); Computerizing&#13;
and Data Processing; (c) Cost and Financial Accounting Systems (this aspect is being covered by an&#13;
ADB funded study and only coordination is required under this TA); (d) Human Resource&#13;
Development; (e) Materials Management; (f) Financial Management; and (g) Customer Relations.&#13;
Plan of Work&#13;
10.        Execution of the TA will be based on collaboration and consultation between the&#13;
Consultant(s) and designated staff of the power companies and MOE concerned with organizational and&#13;
management matters. To this end, the bulk of the institutional strengthening tasks should be carried out&#13;
in Viet Nam. The designated Vietnamese staff will be identified by the relevant institutions prior to the&#13;
start-up of this component and will work with the Consultant(s) for the duration of the component.&#13;
11.        The Consultant(s) will prepare two Reports: a preliminary report of their findings and&#13;
recommendations which would be discussed with the Vietnamese authorities and IDA. A draft Final&#13;
Report would be submitted, taking into account the outputs of the complimentary TAs and would be&#13;
finalized, taking into account the views of the Vietnamese authorities and IDA.&#13;

Tasks&#13;
12.        The following main tasks are visualized: (a) review  the existing organization and&#13;
mianagement structures of the power companies, including the structure of all major functional units,&#13;
taking into account their tasks and inter-organizational relationships; (b) identify weaknesses, if any, in&#13;
the existing organizational structure and recommend changes keeping in mind the: (i) purposes and&#13;
objectives of the organization; (ii) functional areas to be covered; (iii) specialization and division of&#13;
work; (iv) line and staff functions and (v) the need to formalize reporting relationships and lines of&#13;
authority; (c) assess the staffing pattern and recruitment needs to determine and classify the various&#13;
positions required and prepare a staffing proposal based on the recommnended organizational structures&#13;
and interrelationships; (d) prepare job specifications and job manuals setting out suitable qualifications&#13;
and experience for various categories of employees; (e) review and analyze technical practices and&#13;
operating procedures and recommend systems aimed at making those technical practices more uniform;&#13;
(f) review and analyze current financial management practices, recommend changes as required and&#13;
identify training needs to upgrade existing skills; and (g) analyze the information system in place and&#13;
recommend adjustments thereto, or alternatively introduce a management information system&#13;
appropriate to the power company's size and stage of development which will include inter-alia: (i)&#13;
information to be collected, where when and by whom; (ii) design of various reporting fornats for&#13;
different functional departments including construction, generation, transmission distribution,&#13;
commercial, personnel, statistical and administrative; (iii) flow of reports; (iv) procedures for synthesis&#13;
and analysis of reports; (v) procedures for follow-up action and; (vi) comprehensive review of the&#13;
organization, practices and procedures used by the power company's commercial and administrative&#13;
departments; (h) review and recommend improvements to the power companies' (i) administrative&#13;
procedures; and (ii) internal control systems, rules and regulations to cover establishment of procedures,&#13;
adequacy and direction of communication flow and gaps therein, inter-department relationships and&#13;
duplication of actions; and (i) maintain at all times a liaison with the ADB-funded study on cost and&#13;
financial accounting systems.&#13;
13.        The Government would provide accommodation and office facilities to expatriate advisors,&#13;
interpretation/translation services and local travel.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
A. The Project&#13;
1.         The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (the Project) includes inter-alia&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) electricity distribution&#13;
networks, comprising construction of MV and LV lines (overhead and underground) and MV/LV&#13;
substations in Ho Chi Minh City (Part A. 1 of the Project) and in Hue and Nhatrang (Part B. 1 of the&#13;
Project) to be undertaken by the PC2 and PC3, respectively. A separate Resettlement Action Plan for&#13;
the 220kv Krongbuk-Nhatrang power transmission line and 220kv terminal substations at Krongbuck&#13;
and Nhatrang (Part B. 1 of the Project) has been prepared by PC3 and approved by the Government of&#13;
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, dated March 27, 1995.&#13;
B. Distribution System Resettlement Action Plan Phase 1 (RAP-1)&#13;
2.         Every effort will be made to expand the distribution network under Parts A. 1 and B. 1 of&#13;
the Project by utilizing the land already available with PC2 and PC3 (along existing routes). In&#13;
exceptional circumstances acquisition of additional land and/or houses and the resettlement of people&#13;
losing the totality of their land and/or houses or a significant part thereof would be unavoidable.&#13;
However, the final routing of lines and location of new substations, which may require acquisition of&#13;
land and/or houses would be finalized during the detailed design stage under Project implementation.&#13;
To adequately address compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the people to be affected by&#13;
these Parts of the Project (PAPs), the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been divided into Phase 1&#13;
RAP (RAP-1) and Phase 2 RAP (RAP-2). This is the Phase-i RAP.&#13;
3.         The principle objective of the RAP is to ensure that all PAPs will be compensated and&#13;
rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living conditions and income earning&#13;
capacity at the pre-Project levels.&#13;
4.         This RAP-I has been prepared by the PC2 and PC3 and approved by the Government of&#13;
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on March 27, 1995. It lays down the principles and objectives,&#13;
legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, peoples participation&#13;
features and grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the (PAPs).&#13;
Each of PC2 and PC3 will prepare a RAP-2 for Parts A. 1 and B. 1 of the Project, respectively. Each&#13;
RAP-2 will include: (a) results of the census and socio-economic survey of the PAPs and properties to&#13;
be affected; (b) detailed compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various&#13;
categories of PAPs; (c) a timetable for implementation of the RAP-2; (d) allocation of the institutional&#13;
responsibilities for implementation; (e) a detailed budget for funding the various compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation measures; and (f) internal and external monitoring arrangements.&#13;
5.         The census and socio-economic surveys under each of the RAP-2 would be completed as&#13;
soon as possible but no later than six months prior to the estimated date for commencement of the&#13;
works under the respective Part of the Project. Each of the RAP-2 will be furnished to the International&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 4 of 22&#13;
Development Association (IDA) for consideration as soon as possible but no later than three months&#13;
prior to the actual initiation of the works under the respective Part of the Project. Compensation and&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation activities under Parts A. 1 and B. I of the Project will only commence&#13;
after IDA has found acceptable the respective RAP-2 and the Government of the Socialist Republic of&#13;
Viet Nam has approved it. These activities will be completed at least one month before the beginning&#13;
of works in each site under said Parts of the Project.&#13;
C. Project Affected People (PAPS)&#13;
6.         The PAPs include the following persons to be identified in the census and socio-economic&#13;
surveys under each of the RAP-2:&#13;
(a)   persons whose houses are in part or in toto affected by the Project;&#13;
(b)   persons whose premise and/or agricultural land is in part or in toto affected (permanently&#13;
or temporarily) by the Project; and&#13;
(c)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in toto (temporarily or permanently) by&#13;
the Project.&#13;
D. Resetthment Principles and Objectives&#13;
7.         The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been&#13;
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives would be applied:&#13;
(a)   Resettlement will be minimized as much as possible.&#13;
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-&#13;
economic survey are entitled to compensation for their losses and/or income rehabilitation.&#13;
Lack of land use right certificate will not bar the PAP from compensation and/or income&#13;
restoration.&#13;
(c)   PAPs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their standard of&#13;
living or at least maintain their current standards at pre-Project level after resettlement.&#13;
(d)   The means of resettlement and rehabilitation are: compensation at replacement cost for&#13;
houses and other structures, agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity&#13;
acceptable to the PAP, replacement of premise land at least of equal size acceptable to the&#13;
PAP, and transfer allowances.&#13;
(e)   Replacement premise and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the land that was&#13;
lost, acceptable to the PAP.&#13;
(f)   The resettlement transition period will be minimized and land for land and/or cash&#13;
compensation should be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the&#13;
expected start-up date of works in the respective Project site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 14&#13;
Page 5 of 22&#13;
(g)  Resettlement and land acquisition plans will be carried out following consultation with the&#13;
PAPs.&#13;
(h)  The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or improved&#13;
after resettlement.&#13;
(i)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be made available&#13;
as and when required.&#13;
(j)  Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning and&#13;
implementation of the RAP.&#13;
(k) Internal and external effective and timely monitoring will be provided on the&#13;
implementation of the RAP.&#13;
Section 2&#13;
Institutional and Legal Framework&#13;
A. Institutional Framework&#13;
8.         The responsibility for implementing the RAP are as follows:&#13;
(a)   The respective Power Company (PC) has overall responsibility for planning and&#13;
implementing the RAP within its jurisdiction. For this purpose, the respective PC, will&#13;
coordinate with the respective District Peoples' Committees (DPCs).  The peoples&#13;
committees at the commune level will discuss the various aspects of the RAP with the&#13;
PAPs.&#13;
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by PC2/PC3 based on decisions,&#13;
reached through negotiations between local governments (district and commune peoples&#13;
committees) and the PAPs.&#13;
(c)   Provincial, District, and Commune People's Committees will organize and carry out the&#13;
RAP within the areas of their responsibility under the supervision of the respective PC.&#13;
B. Legal Framework&#13;
9.         The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 (as&#13;
amplified by Government decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994) enacted by the National Assembly of&#13;
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on July 1993.  Article 27 provides that: 'In case of utmost&#13;
necessity, when the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defense, security,&#13;
national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the&#13;
damages".&#13;
&#13;

10.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government Decree&#13;
No. 87-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provides for land for land compensation and cash for&#13;
land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been established&#13;
for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national purposes, and&#13;
for tax value for issuing land use rights certificates.&#13;
Section 3&#13;
Entitlement Policy&#13;
11.        PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation as they apply to individual&#13;
situations according to the eligibility and entitlement categories defined above.&#13;
12.        PAPs losing agricultural land will be compensated as follows:&#13;
(a)  the general mechanism for compensation of lost agricultural land will be through "land for&#13;
land" arrangements of equal productive capacity, satisfactory to the PAP. However, if&#13;
such land is not available in the vicinity, compensation in cash; at full replacement cost,&#13;
can be provided as mutually agreed between the PAP and the relevant peoples' committee.&#13;
If the portion of the land to be lost represents 20% or less of the total area of the land,&#13;
cash compensation, at full replacement cost, will be provided to the PAP; and&#13;
(b)   PAPs who are forced to relocate or lose agricultural land shall be compensated with the&#13;
market price for the loss of standing crops. In case of loss of fruit or industrial trees,&#13;
these will be compensated at market price.&#13;
13.        PAPs whose houses will be affected by the Project will be provided with:&#13;
(a)   replacement residential (premises) land of equivalent size; and (ii) cash compensation,&#13;
reflecting full replacement cost of the structure without depreciation.&#13;
(b)  if the premise land and/or structure is only partially being affected by the Project and the&#13;
remaining part of the structure is habitable, either the entire premise land and structure&#13;
would be acquired from the PAP and compensation paid as under sub-paragraph (a), or&#13;
alternatively, compensation in cash reflecting full replacement cost of the portion of the&#13;

Introduction&#13;
A. The Project&#13;
32.        The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (the Project) includes inter-alia&#13;
construction of 147 Iam, 220kv Krongbuk-Nhatrang power transmission line and 220kv terminal&#13;
substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang (Part B.1 of the Project). This is the RAP for this project&#13;
component. The project also includes the rehabilitation and expansion of medium voltage (MV) and&#13;
low voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, comprising construction of MV and LV lines&#13;
(overhead and underground) and MV/LV substations in Ho Chi Minh City (Part A. 1 of the Project) and&#13;
in Hue and Nhatrang (Part B. I of the Project) to be undertaken by the PC2 and PC3, respectively.&#13;
Regarding the latter, a separate Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared by PC3 and approved by&#13;
the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, dated March 27, 1995.&#13;
B.   Transnission Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.         Under Part B.2 of the Project, Power Company 3 (PC3) will be constructing the 220kV,&#13;
147 klm, Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line (T/L) and the 220 kV terminal substations at Krongbuk&#13;
and Nhatrang. The width of the transmission Line Right of Way (ROW) is 22 meters.&#13;
Project Impact Area&#13;
2.         The project area is in west-central Viet Nam, in the central uplands where many ethnic&#13;
mninority groups reside. The line passes through sparsely populated areas of Dac Lac and Khanh Hoa&#13;
provinces, running south-east from Krongbuk substation through the gently sloping terrain around the&#13;
borders of Dac Lac and Khong Hoa provinces and traverses parts of the coastal plains near Nhatrang.&#13;
Protect Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact&#13;
3.         Lands, houses, crops and other properties will be affected in the 22 meters ROW of the&#13;
transmission line. Out of the total T/L ROW area of 325 hectares only 3.56 hectares are actually&#13;
required for siting of the T/L towers. Waste land without any cultivation or houses on it will be&#13;
acquired for the Krongbuk and Nhatrang substations. The area affected by the Project includes 85&#13;
houses. About 51 % of ROW area is waste land under state control. About 157 hectares or 49 % of the&#13;
total land is cultivated. The major crops/trees in the T/L ROW are coffee, eucalyptus, rice, mango,&#13;
jackfruit, pineapple and vegetables. Of the 80 houses in the ROW, 66 houses are of good quality and&#13;
14 houses are made of thatched and other light materials. Table 1 summarizes the houses, crops, trees&#13;
and other properties affected by the project. Land which is not directly required for siting of the T/L&#13;
towers can be used for cultivation even after construction, however, trees above 4 meters in height will&#13;
not be allowed in the ROW.&#13;
&#13;

4.         This RAP has been prepared by the Power Company No. 3 (PC3) and approved by the&#13;
Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on March 27, 1995. It lays down the principles and&#13;
objectives, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, peoples's&#13;
participation features and grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the&#13;
project affected persons(PAPs). The RAP also includes results of the census and socio-economic survey&#13;
of the PAPs and properties to be affected, compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
entitlements of various categories of PAPs; a timetable for implementation of the RAP; allocation of&#13;
the institutional responsibilities for implementation; a budget for funding the various compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation measures; and internal and external monitoring arrangements.&#13;
5.         The principle objective of this RAP is to ensure that all project affected persons (PAPs)&#13;
will be compensated and rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living&#13;
conditions and income earning capacity at the pre-Project levels. The RAP also aims to ensure that&#13;
communities are not broken up as a result of resettlement and that the PAPs are resettled in the vicinity&#13;
of their original residential areas. The project has been designed taking into consideration the need to&#13;
minimize resettlement. The route of the T/L has been chosen to ensure that it passes over minimum&#13;
number of houses and cultivated areas. No ethnic minority groups will be affected by the Project. Also&#13;
the lands chosen for substations is not under any productive use and does not have any built up&#13;
structures on it.&#13;
C. Project Affected People (PAPS)&#13;
6.          The PAPs include the following persons:&#13;
(a)   persons whose houses are in part or in toto affected by construction of the power&#13;
transmission line;&#13;
(b)   persons whose premise and/or agricultural land is in part or in toto affected (permanently&#13;
or temporarily) due to the construction of the power transmission line;&#13;
(c)   persons whose agricultural land is in the ROW of the power transmission line; and&#13;
(d)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in toto (temporarily or permanently) due&#13;
the construction of the power transmission line.&#13;
D. Resettlement Principles and Objectives&#13;
7.         The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been&#13;
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives have been applied:&#13;
(a)   Resettlement will be minimized as much as possible.&#13;
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-&#13;
economic survey are entitled to compensation and/or resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Section 2&#13;
Institutional and Legal Framework&#13;
A. Institutional Framework&#13;
8.         The responsibilities for implementing the RAP are as follows:&#13;
(a)   PC3 has overall responsibility for planning and implementing the RAP. For this purpose,&#13;
the PC2 will coordinate with the respective District Peoples Committees (DPCs). The&#13;
peoples committees at the commune level will discuss the various aspects of the RAP with&#13;
the PAPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 15 of 22&#13;
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by PC3 based on decisions reached&#13;
through negotiations between local governments (district and conmmune peoples&#13;
committees) and the PAPs.&#13;
c)   PC3 will implement the RAP in coordination with the Provincial, District, and Commune&#13;
People's Committees.&#13;
B. Legal Framework&#13;
9.         The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 (as&#13;
further amplified by Government Decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994) enacted by the National&#13;
Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Viet Namn on July 1993. Article 27 provides that: "In case of&#13;
utmost necessity, when the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defense, security,&#13;
national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the&#13;
damages ".&#13;
10.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government Decree&#13;
No. 87-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provides for land for land compensation and cash for&#13;
land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been established&#13;
for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national purposes, and&#13;
for tax value for issuing land use rights certificates.&#13;
Section 3&#13;
Entitlement Policy&#13;
11.        PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation as they apply to individual&#13;
situations according to the eligibility and entitlement categories defined above.&#13;
PAPs losing agricultural land will be compensated as follows:&#13;
(a)  the general mechanism for compensation of lost agriculutural land will be through "land&#13;
for land" arrangements of equal productive capacity, satisfactory to the PAP. However, if&#13;
such land is not available in the vicinity, compensation in cash, at full replacement cost,&#13;
can be provided, as mutually agreed between the PAP and the relevant peoples'&#13;
committee. If the portion of the land to be lost represents 20% or less of the total area of&#13;
the land, cash compensation, at full replacement cost, will be provided to the PAP; and&#13;
(b)   PAPs who are forced to relocate or lose agricultural land shall be compensated with the&#13;
market price for the loss of standing crops. In case of loss of fruit or industrial trees,&#13;
these will be compensated at market price.&#13;
PAPs whose houses will be affected by the Project will be provided with:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 16 of 22&#13;
(c)  replacement residential (premises) land of equivalent size; and (ii) cash compensation,&#13;
reflecting full replacement cost of the structure without depreciation.&#13;
(d)  if the premise land and/or structure is only partially being affected by the Project and the&#13;
remaining part of the structure is habitable, either the entire premise land and structure&#13;
would be acquired from the PAP and compensation paid as under sub-paragraph (a), or&#13;
alternatively, compensation in cash reflecting full replacement cost of the portion of the&#13;
premise land and/or structure affected will be provided, as mutually agreed between the&#13;
PAP and the relevant peoples' committee; and&#13;
(e)   Transfer of Houses to New Sites: The PAP will be paid an allowance for transfer of&#13;
houses from their existing locations to the resettlement sites. The amount of assistance&#13;
will be 1 million VN Dong (about US $ 100), and may be increased for specific cases.&#13;
(f)   Land in T/L ROW: Land not directly acquired for construction but in the T/L ROW can&#13;
be used by the current users for cultivation, grazing and other activities, and will not be&#13;
compensated. However, a height restriction of 4 meters will be observed by the current&#13;
users for all future development. Hence, trees of commercial value with height more than&#13;
4 meters would be removed and fully compensated. Trees of non-commercial value&#13;
would be trimmed, and maintenance cost would be paid to the-owner, if he/she undertakes&#13;
this work.&#13;
(g)   Waste Land of LPCs: Arrangements for the use of waste lands belonging to the local&#13;
peoples' committees (LPCs) would be mutually agreed between the Government and the&#13;
concerned LPC.&#13;
(h)   Damage During Construction: Compensation would be paid for damage caused to crops&#13;
and trees during T/L construction at market rates.&#13;
Section 4&#13;
People's Participation in the Project&#13;
12.        The PAPs will participate throughout the various stages of the resettlement activities.&#13;
They will be consulted by the competent authorities and will be invited to participate in public meetings&#13;
held by the PC3 and/or by the local peoples' committees.&#13;
13.        The PAPs will be adequately informed by the relevant local peoples' committees of the&#13;
details of the RAP.&#13;
14.        All activities relating to fixing and payment of compensation and the resettlement program&#13;
will be carried out with the participation of the affected people and their representatives. The affected&#13;
communes and villages were informed about the project as soon as the proposal to implement the&#13;
project was finalized. The first activity to be carried out for implementation of the RAP, i.e.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-140-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 17 of 22&#13;
conducting surveys of the affected properties was carried out with the complete participation of the&#13;
affected person and peoples representatives. The survey record, prepared by district surveyors, was&#13;
finalized in the presence of the affected person, village head or his representative, commune&#13;
representative and a representative of PC3. The affected person signs the survey record if he is&#13;
satisfied with the details of his property recorded on the survey form. Fixation of compensation will be&#13;
similarly agreed to by the affected person. Land and property can only be acquired if the affected&#13;
person signs the compensation form. Land for resettlement will be approved by the commune before it&#13;
is selected for resettlement. Before finalization, various proposed sites will be shown to the affected&#13;
people and they select the location depending on their preference. In Vietnam there is time respected&#13;
tradition of consultations with and participation of the people in all matters which affect them. Most of&#13;
the activities mentioned in the RAP were and will be carried out with the involvement of the&#13;
conmnunes, which are truly representative of the peoples interests.&#13;
Section 5&#13;
Baseline Information&#13;
A. Cesus and Inventory of Project Affected People&#13;
15.        The physical survey of the selected route of the transmission line was carried out by the&#13;
Power Investigation and Design Company No. 2 (PIDC2), based at Nhatrang. The survey of affected&#13;
families and properties was done along with the detailed physical survey of the T/L route. The number&#13;
of houses and other properties affected, and the area under various agricultural, fruit and tree crops was&#13;
determined and plotted on the map providing the detailed physical description of the T/L route. The&#13;
precise location of each house and various cropped areas is given in this map. A list showing: (a) the&#13;
location of the affected houses and their position in the T/L ROW; (b) the type of materials used in&#13;
house construction; (c) the name of the owner and the exact number of affected persons in each house;&#13;
and (d) the income level of each household is given in Annex 1. In each of the affected houses resides&#13;
only one family; therefore, the total number of affected families is 80 (386 people). Agriculture, along&#13;
with raising of some animals, is the main occupation of the project affected persons (PAPs) .&#13;
16.        The lands proposed for construction of the Krongbuk and Nhatrang substations belong to&#13;
the local peoples' committees (LPCs). These are waste lands without any cultivation or houses or any&#13;
other economic activities being carried out on them.&#13;

Transmission Utility (PTU) No. 2, the Provincial Peoples Committees (PPC), District Peoples'&#13;
Committees (DPC) and the commune authorities. The overall responsibility for implementing the RAP&#13;
will be that of PC3. PC3 will exercise its functions through two of its subsidiary agencies; namely the&#13;
PTU No. 2 based at Nhatrang and the Power Project Management Group based at Danang. Though&#13;
most of the activities will be carried out in close coordination with the Peoples' Committees at various&#13;
levels, the officials of PC3 and its two subsidiaries will ensure that implementation complies with the&#13;
RAP. PC3 will be responsible for coordinating the disbursement of funds. The funds would be&#13;
disbursed to the people directly by PTU No. 2, with the LPC acting as a witness.&#13;

19.          The PPCs of the respective provinces will inform  the concerned districts about the&#13;
resettlement program and direct them to take the steps necessary for compensation and resettlement of&#13;
the PAP within their jurisdiction. The DPCs will inform the PAP and the respective communes about&#13;
the project and the RIC program and coordinate its activities. The DPCs will be responsible for fixing&#13;
compensation levels for various types of affected properties in accordance with the principles of this&#13;
RAP (see legal framework) and supervise the detailed surveys of these properties. Payment of&#13;
compensation will be supervised by PC3 and its agencies and allotment of alternative lands will be the&#13;
responsibility of the DPCs. The commnune authorities will be in charge of informing the PAPs about&#13;
the project impact and implementation schedule, to redress their grievances and to act as a&#13;
communication link between the PAPs and the DPCs, PPCs, PTU No. 2 and PC3. Most routine&#13;
activities will be coordinated directly by the conmmune and district authorities. PC3 will finance the&#13;
total cost of the RAP and ensure the timely availability of funds. Table 2 shows the activities which&#13;
need to be carried out as a part of the R/C program and the organization(s) responsible for it.&#13;

D. Complaints and Grievances&#13;
21.          Complaints and grievances related to any aspect of the RAP will be handled through&#13;
negotiations aimed at achieving consensus.&#13;
22.          Settlement between the PAP and local government will be first attempted at the level of&#13;
the Commune. If this first conciliation attempt fails, the case will be discussed a second time at the&#13;
District level. If at the District level the case is not resolved, an ad-hoc committee established by the&#13;
Provincial Peoples' Cormmittee will decide the matter.&#13;
23.          In cases where, despite the above efforts, no agreement is reached between the parties, the&#13;
case will be submitted to the District court.&#13;
24.          PAPs who present their cases to the Commune, District and Provincial authorities, will be&#13;
exempted from any legal fees. PAPs, who bring their case to the District Court, will have to follow the&#13;
prevailing laws.&#13;
E. Supervsion and Monitoring&#13;
25.          Implementation of the RAP will be regularly supervised and monitored by PC3 in&#13;
coordination with the respective local peoples' committees. An agency nominated by each PC will&#13;
periodically carry out external monitoring and evaluation. External monitoring will be done by an&#13;
organization such as an academic or a research institution, an NGO or an independent consulting firm.&#13;
They will be identified and hired during the first year of Project implementation by each PC.&#13;

property assessment and compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation has been carried out&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of the RAP;&#13;
(b)   oversee that RAP is implemented as approved; and&#13;
(c)   verify that funds for implementing the RAP are provided in a timely manner, are&#13;
sufficient for their purposes, and are spent in accordance with the provisions of the RAP.&#13;
27.        In addition to verifying the reports generated by the internal monitoring, the external&#13;
monitoring agency will carry out the following tasks:&#13;
(a)   evaluate the social and economic impact of RAP implementation on the PAPs;&#13;
(b)   verify if the objective of enhancement or at least restoration of income levels and&#13;
standards of living of the PAPs has been met; and&#13;
(c)   suggest modification in RAP implementation to achieve the principles and objectives set&#13;
forth in of this RAP.&#13;

Summary of Mitigation Measures S-&#13;
2.            In order to reduce environmental impacts from  the proposed development, mitigation&#13;
measures, summarized below, have already been put in hand in relation to (a) altering the location for&#13;
the cooling water discharge point and (b) agreeing adequate compensation for the acquisition of land&#13;
from a local shrimp farm cooperative. As described below, mitigation measures are also planned to&#13;
reduce the impacts of noise and waste water streams. Apart from these, and taking into account the&#13;
relatively minor residual impacts of the proposed development no further mitigation measures are&#13;
considered necessary.&#13;
3.            The initially selected cooling water discharge point, which was beside the power station,&#13;
has been relocated to a more suitable site because of the danger of unacceptably high temperature rises&#13;
in the receiving waters. This will require the construction of a 3 km long pipe route to the new&#13;
discharge point which is located by a large body of water where the discharge of the cooling water will&#13;
have no significant impact. While the laying of this pipeline will itself cause some loss of mangrove&#13;
trees, the route will be chosen to minimize this impact and, as the pipe is buried underground, any&#13;
disturbed area will after a few years return to its original state. Planting of any disturbed areas will&#13;
reduce the time for regrowth.&#13;
1/ Paras. 2, 3 and 4 are not relevant to cooling tower alternative.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-148-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
4.         For the development of the proposed cooling water intake lagoon. PC2 will need to&#13;
acquire 40 hectares of land currently used for shrimp and rice farming. Adequate compensation terms&#13;
have been agreed which will allow the owners to move their activities to areas not currently utilized and&#13;
avoid socio-economic impacts as well as any indirect environmental effects.&#13;
5.         Available data on existing noise at the site are limited, but indicate that there may be a&#13;
danger of breaching guideline levels at nearby residences. A survey to be carried out will give a much&#13;
better picture of the present situation. If this survey shows that guidelines are being breached then it&#13;
may be necessary to specify the level of acoustic cladding and other silencing equipment for the new&#13;
development such that it will have no significant additional noise at the site perimeter. Given that the&#13;
waste heat boilers and steam turbines will be enclosed, the cost of the additional acoustic insulation&#13;
would be very small compared with the overall project cost.&#13;
6.         Depending on the outcome of the survey findings two alternative noise mitigation measures&#13;
may be more economic. These are (a) the erection at the site perimeter of a berm (earth mound) with&#13;
planted trees and shrubs to insulate noise emissions and (b) the acoustic insulation of residences where&#13;
indoor noise is high. The costs associated with both these mitigation measures are minor.&#13;
7.         Waste water streams from the proposed development includifig (a) water plant treatment&#13;
waste, (b) sewage, (c) surface drains, (d) boiler blowdown, (e) boiler acid cleaning effluent will all be&#13;
reated, as required, so that the effluent discharged satisfies Vietnamese waste water effluent regulations&#13;
and will cause no significant impact.&#13;

VIET NAM&#13;
Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project&#13;
Assumptions in the Financial Statements&#13;
Inflation&#13;
1.         Viet Nam's inflation rate over the past years has been volatile as the country was&#13;
undergoing its adjustment process toward a market-oriented economy. The inflation rate was 68% in&#13;
1990 and 1991 declining to 18% in 1992 and 8% in 1993. The Government is keen on maintaining a&#13;
single-digit inflation rate. The Bank expects the rate of inflation to drop further and, on average, to&#13;
stabilize around 5-6% per annum during the projected period 1994-2000. Unless otherwise stated, a&#13;
5% inflation rate has been built into the financial projections.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
2.         The financial projections assume that tariffs would be progressively raised to an average&#13;
level of US cents 7/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. Assuming a 5 % annual depreciation&#13;
of the Dong vis-a-vis the dollar, this tariff in 1999 would be about US cents 974/kWh for PC2 and US&#13;
cents 848/kWh for PC3.&#13;
Losses&#13;
3.         Technical and non-technical losses currently at 20% and 3% for PC2 and 18% and 7% for&#13;
PC3, respectively, are: (a) projected to be maintained at 19% and 3% for PC2; and (b) projected to be&#13;
reduced to 17% and 6% in 1998 and to drop further to 17% and 5% in 2000 for PC3, in line with&#13;
Govermnent's proposals.&#13;
Purchase of Power&#13;
4.         The projected price of purchased power for PC2 of about D 290 per kWh sold is based on&#13;
the estimated cost of a medium-sized hydroelectric station. Currently, PCI and PC2 sell power to PC3&#13;
at D 5/kWh. This negligible tariff was set by the Government to improve PC3's financial results&#13;
without adversely affecting the finances of PC1 and PC2. As PC3's financial condition continues to&#13;
remain unsatisfactory till around 1998, the projections assume that the purchase price would continue to&#13;
remain at D 5/kWh.&#13;
Cost of Fuel&#13;
5.         Fuel includes the cost of oil, gas and diesel consumed by PC2 and PC3 in their thermal&#13;
generating facilities. All fuel costs have been assumed at their present prices until 1995 when prices are&#13;
projected to increase by 10% each in 1996, 1998 and 2000. These expenses are based on fuel prices&#13;
used in the calculation of the present tariff structure as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-159-&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Power Company No. 2&#13;
Oil. The price of heavy oil including average transportation cost to site is at present D&#13;
1,324,250/MT. This price is about equal to US$18 - US$19 per barrel. PC2 is permitted to&#13;
negotiate the price with the oil companies. On average, the steam stations of PC2 use 0.25 kg of&#13;
oil/kWh. The fuel cost per kWh produced is D 331.&#13;
Gas. It is assumed that starting 1996 natural gas will be available for power generation although&#13;
the price has not yet been decided. It is expected that the price will be between US$ 2.00 (D&#13;
21,800) and US$ 2.50 (D 27,250)/MMBTU (252,000 kcal). The financial projections assume a&#13;
price of US$ 2.00 per 252,000 kcal.&#13;
Diesel. The price of diesel is at present D 2,635,250/MT (US$ 241.77fMT or about D 2,725&#13;
per liter). Diesel stations use on average 0.2 kg/kWh produced.&#13;
Power Companv No. 3&#13;
Apart from a few micro hydro stations, PC3 operates only diesel stations at the following cost on&#13;
average: D 2,800/kg plus 0.5% for losses during transport and D 145/kg for transport. Diesel&#13;
stations use on average 0.272 kg/kWh produced. The price is negotiable and was decreased by&#13;
D 30 from the above price in July 1, 1994.&#13;
Salaijes, Wages and Benefits&#13;
6.         PC2 and PC3 record only base salaries and wages in their income staternents; staff,&#13;
however, also draws bonuses and benefits which are not recorded in the costs of the income statement.&#13;
The projections include bonuses and benefits in the income statements.&#13;
Operation, Maintenance and Administration&#13;
7.         PC2 and PC3 are required to eliminate the cost component "Facility Maintenance" from&#13;
their income statements; these expenses have been included in the projections.&#13;
Taxes&#13;
8.         Taxes are based on current levels as follows: (a) Tax on Revenues at 8% of revenues and&#13;
4% of other revenues; (b) Charge on Natural Resources at 2% of that part of revenues from sales of&#13;
power which corresponds to the percentage of hydro generation versus total generation; (c) Tax on&#13;
Capital at 2.4% of net plant in service; and (d) Income Tax at 25%.&#13;
Depreciation&#13;
9.         Depreciation rates for PC2 and PC3 are prescribed by the Government and calculated on&#13;
the following basis: turbines (8%), rockfill dams (2%), concrete dams (3%), distribution systems&#13;
(8.5%). The financial projections include depreciation, on average at the rate of 5.4% for PC2 and&#13;
5.0% for PC3.&#13;

Capital Structure&#13;
10.        The following capital structure is assumed: (a) existing Government capital remains as&#13;
equity and is not transformed into debt; (b) starting FY94 new investments are assumed to be financed&#13;
at one third Government contributions and two thirds debt; (c) long term debts have been assumed at an&#13;
annual interest rate of 7.5% with repayment terms of up to 15 years including two years of grace; (d)&#13;
no dividend payments on equity have been assumed; and (e) PC2 and PC3 will capitalize interest during&#13;
construction.&#13;
Investments&#13;
11.        Projected capital expenditures are those estimnated to provide the additonal plant and&#13;
equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated at the rate of expected inflation of 6% p.a.&#13;
Fixed Assets&#13;
12.        Due to doubtful past valuation procedures, fixed assets as recorded by PC2 and PC3 may&#13;
not represent their real value. Consequently, the financial projections are based on fixed assets as&#13;
available at the end of FY93.&#13;
Current Assets and Liabilities&#13;
13.        Accounts receivable are projected to be approximately two months and four months of&#13;
revenues for PC2 and PC3, respectively. Current payables are projected at the equivalent of one week&#13;
of fuel expenses and 20% of annual capital expenditures.&#13;

Economnic Justification of the Project&#13;
1.         This Annex presents the assumptions and working details for the economic justification of&#13;
the project components.&#13;
Basis for Costs and Monetary Benefits&#13;
2.          All costs and monetary benefits are converted to 1994 prices. It is common practice to&#13;
apply a shadow exchange rate multiplier and a conversion factor for expenditure on local labor. The&#13;
former is used to correct for distortions in the exchange rate; because of the liberalized nature of the&#13;
market for foreign exchange in Viet Nam, it is estimated that the exchange rate does not suffer from&#13;
distortions, and no adjustments are made. For the latter, designed to remove distortions of subsidies&#13;
and taxes from this component, a conversion factor of 0.75 is assumed.&#13;
Conversion of Ba Ria Open Cyde Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation&#13;
3.         The power balance for PC2's system is shown in Table 3.1 indicating the need for&#13;
additional capacity by 1996-97. Given the shape of PC2's daily load curve, and the energy inflows to,&#13;
storage capacity and power capability of the hydro stations in PC2's service area, the requirement is for&#13;
base load rather than peaking capacity.&#13;
4.          With the availability of offshore natural gas at about US$ 2.0 per MMBTU (economic cost&#13;
about US$1.3/MMBTU) by mnid 1995, Ba Ria becomes the least cost proposition for base load thermal&#13;
capacity addition in PC2's system by 1996-97. There are three basic natural gas-fired options for the&#13;
expansion of Ba Ria's generating capacity. These options and the levelised costs for each are shown in&#13;
Table A21.1 below. The least-cost solution is that proposed for the project: the conversion of three gas&#13;
turbines to a combined cycle block. The conversion of existing turbines to combined cycle operation&#13;
does not require additional fuel; however, the construction of new plant will require this fuel.&#13;

Estimation of the EIRR of The Project&#13;
5.          Assumptions regarding the project are:&#13;
(a)   the capital costs are US$62.82 million in foreign costs and US$6.26 million in local costs;&#13;
this represents the base costs plus a 10% allowance for physical contingencies; price&#13;
contingencies are excluded; this also excludes duties and taxes; 26% of the local costs&#13;
represent expenditure on labor;&#13;
(b)   capital expenditure is phased 40% in 1995, 40%in 1996 and 20% in 1997;&#13;
(c)   O&amp;M  costs are assumed to be US$1.73 million per year of operation, in real terms&#13;
(approximately 2.5% of capital expenditure);&#13;
(d)   no fuel costs are attributed to the project; the addition of the steam unit increases output&#13;
simply by recycling the exhaust gases from turbine operation;&#13;
(e)  the unit operates at a 50% plant load factor in 1997, followed by a 68% plant load factor&#13;
thereafter; the unit has a 20 year life, and ceases operation in 2016;&#13;
(f)  the output from the unit is decreased by the level of losses forec:ast for the system in each&#13;
year of operation; this represents the incremental sales from the project;&#13;
(g)   the tariff is assumed to increase progressively to 7 USc/kWh by 1999, in nominal terms;&#13;
based on Governments proposals.&#13;
6.          Table A21.6 presents the computation of incremental benefits and costs attributed to the&#13;
project, while Table A21.2. presents the results of the computation for the Base Case and various&#13;
sensitivity cases.&#13;

Rehabilitation of the Distribution Network in HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang&#13;
7.          Tables A21.3, A21.4 and A21.5 present: (a) capital expenditures on the distribution and&#13;
upstream sub-transmission systems; (b) technical losses; (c) electricity sales; (d) energy required by the&#13;
system; and (e) unserved energy, for the "with project" and "without project" cases, for HCMC, Hue&#13;
and Nhatrang. The capital costs include a 10% allowance for physical contingency; price contingencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are excluded as also are duties and taxes. Of the local expenditure, 26% is in the form of labor&#13;
services. No incremental O&amp;M costs were included for either case; O&amp;M costs would be even higher&#13;
for the "without project" case.&#13;
8.         The EIRRs are calculated on the stream of costs and benefits over a project economic life&#13;
of 25 years. The losses (technical only) are valued at the LRMC figure of 5 USc/kWh at the&#13;
subtransmission level and the reduction in unsupplied energy is conservatively valued at 10 times the&#13;
tariff. The details of the cost and benefit streams are presented in Tables A21.7 - A21.9. EIRRs&#13;
calculated for the base and several sensitivity cases are tabulated below. The sensitivities undertaken&#13;
are designed to examine the impact of: (i) increasing capital costs; (ii) lower demand; and (iii) a 50%&#13;
reduction in the valuation of unserved energy.&#13;

Load Dispatch Centers&#13;
9.           The project benefits are quantified over the period to 2012, providing a 15 year period for&#13;
benefits following commissioning. It is assumed that the control centers would allow a 0.5 % saving in&#13;
energy efficiency; given the energy constrained nature of the system in the medium term, this is&#13;
considered analogous to an increase in sales and is therefore valued using the prevailing tariff rate,&#13;
adjusted for losses. The value of unserved energy used is assumed conservatively at ten times the tariff&#13;
level; the quantity of unserved energy due to transmission faults is estimated to be half the total&#13;
unserved energy forecast. It is assumed that the control centers could provide a 20% reduction in the&#13;
unserved energy (declining from 1.7% in 1994 to 0.5% by 2001) due to transmission faults. It is also&#13;
assumed that by 2012, the improved frequency control would have lead to a reduction in UPS&#13;
equipment in the country equivalent to 0.1 % of forecast peak demand. This equipment costs in the&#13;
region of US$2,000 per kW. Finally, it is assumed that automation would save about 35 staff valued at&#13;
US$5,000 per staff-year.&#13;
10.          The investment in the load dispatch centers totals US$38.75 million; annual O&amp;M  costs&#13;
equal to 2% of this expenditure are assumed. The investment is estimated to be phased 20%, 40%,&#13;
40% over the years 1995-1997.&#13;
11.          The EIRR (see Table A21. 10 for details), including all benefits, is 27.0%. Decreasing by&#13;
50% the benefits from a reduction in unserved energy and in the purchase of UPS equipment gives an&#13;
EIRR of 20.3%, and assuming that efficiency savings are equal to 0.25% of generation reduces the&#13;
EIRR to 23.3%. Taking the improvement in efficiency alone, the EIRR is 11 %.&#13;
