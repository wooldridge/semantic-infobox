TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
I. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER CONSTRAINTS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1         During the past two decades Thailand has undergone a rapid transformation&#13;
from a predominantly agriculture-based society to an emerging industrial economy oriented&#13;
towards manufacturing, services and external trade.  In the 1 980s the emphasis of&#13;
Government policy switched from import-substitution industrialization policies to export-&#13;
oriented manufacturing. Real GDP grew at almost 11% annually during 1987-93, and even&#13;
as the economy slowed in 1991-1992, growth remained close to 8% p.a. The share of&#13;
manufacturing in GDP increased from 16% in 1970 to over 27% in 1993, with most of the&#13;
increase occurring in the late 1980s. During the 1990s, agriculture is expected to continue&#13;
fall as a proportion of GDP, and manufacturing will continue to increase, while becoming&#13;
more sophisticated and diversified in terms of both products and technology.  Family&#13;
ownership and extended family business organizations have given way to a variety of&#13;
corporate entities with organized labor forces, modern management systems, and increasingly&#13;
sophisticated technological processes. The Government now makes few direct interventions&#13;
in the market and leaves the leading role in decision-making to the private sector. Indeed,&#13;
official policies actively encourage and support private enterprise.&#13;
1.2         The overall macroeconomic environment during the past few decades has, in&#13;
general, been favorable for educational development. Rapid growth and structural change in&#13;
the economy have led to inevitable adjustments in the education and training system. The&#13;
need for an educated population as the basis for development together with a strong&#13;
commitment to equity goals have led to universal access to primary education, with high&#13;
completion rates, as well as to effective nonformal programs to increase adult literacy. After&#13;
stagnating through the 1980s, lower secondary education has been expanding in recent years.&#13;
The transition rate from primary to lower secondary had reached 86% in 1994 and is planned&#13;
to reach 100% by 1997. In principle there is an upper secondary place for each graduate of&#13;
lower secondary education, half of which are in vocational schools and colleges.&#13;
1.3         The rapid economic development of the country has brought about an&#13;
increasing demand for well-trained skilled workers and technicians in all fields. Fueled by&#13;
private sector expansion, jobs are being restructured to accommodate new technologies, and&#13;
there is a growing demand for employees with higher level skills.  This has become&#13;
particularly critical in the manufacturing sector where employment has grown steadily over&#13;
the past decade and where rapid expansion is expected to continue.  The vocational and&#13;
technical education (VTE) system, which trains skilled workers and technicians, is attempting&#13;
to adjust its efforts to changing demand in the labor market. It brings to this task both&#13;
strengths and weaknesses and these are described in detail in Section II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B. Labor Force&#13;
1.4          Changes in the composition of employment from  agricultural to non-&#13;
agricultural sectors are becoming increasingly apparent. Based on the Labor Force Surveys',&#13;
the total labor force increased by 37% between 1980 and 1990. During this period, the&#13;
number of persons employed in non-agriculture sectors increased by 69%, raising the share&#13;
of these sectors from 29% to 36%. Agricultural sector employment increased by 24% from&#13;
1980 to 1990.&#13;
1.5          The educational attainment of the work force has been growing. The rapid&#13;
increase in completion of vocational education is notable, exceeding the rate of growth in&#13;
general education attainment. About two-thirds of vocational attainment has been at the&#13;
upper secondary level, and one-third at the post-secondary level. The overall level of&#13;
secondary education (both academic and vocational), however, is lower than was the case in&#13;
the Asian NEEs at a similar stage of industrialization.&#13;
1.6         In 1989 formal employment comprised 14% of total employment and it is&#13;
expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.0% and 3.4% during 1991-1995 and 1996-2000,&#13;
respectively.2 In 1990, the share of employees with vocational education was 14.5%, with&#13;
8.3% (or 408,780 persons) at the certificate level and 6.2% (or 306,040 persons) at the&#13;
diploma level. This share is expected to increase from 14.5% to 21% between 1990 and&#13;
2000. During the same period, demand for formal employees will increase at 6.5% p.a. for&#13;
certificate level and 8.9% p.a. for diploma level.&#13;
C. Demand and Supply for Science and Technical Manpower&#13;
1.7          Reflecting the concerns raised above and the urgent need to strengthen&#13;
science and technical (S&amp;T) manpower to remain competitive in the global market,&#13;
Thailand's Seventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (1992-1996) set specific&#13;
S&amp;T development policy targets. Some of these include: (a) increasing the number of&#13;
technicians from 141.5 to 221.5 per 10,000 population; and (b) establishing 50 new district-&#13;
level vocational colleges and 25 new polytechnics.&#13;
1.8          The current situation for the employment of S&amp;T manpower shows that of the&#13;
14.5% of formal employees with vocational education, only 26.1% of certificate holders,&#13;
26.5% of diploma holders and 23.2% of university graduates have an S&amp;T background. This&#13;
further implies that, as a share of total formal employment very few employees have training&#13;
in S&amp;T: 2% at the certificate level; 1.4% at the diploma level, and 2.3% at the degree level.&#13;
National Statistics Office: Labor Force Surveys 1991, 1990, 1985, 1980 (Round 3).&#13;
2 TDRI/NESDB (1992). "Manpower Planning for the Development of Industrial Service Sectors." The&#13;
Study projected growth in labor force supply and demand for S&amp;T manpower at the vocational and&#13;
university level. The model takes account a number of factors which impinge on the labor force&#13;
participation rates of men and women. The projection is based on a survey of firms and the 1989 Labor&#13;
Force Survey (Third Round).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.9         Manpower Demand.   Two alternative scenarios were used in the&#13;
TDRI/NESDB study to forecast S&amp;T manpower requirements, according to how fast the&#13;
share of S&amp;T manpower in total employment is assumed to increase. In the base case, the&#13;
demand for S&amp;T formal employees grows in response to the sectoral GDP growth rates&#13;
under the Seventh Plan. Under this scenario, employment demand is expected to increase to&#13;
175,070 and 278,580 persons by 1995 and 2000, respectively. The average growth rates of&#13;
employment demand for these S&amp;T streams are on average 10.9% during 1991-1995 and&#13;
9.5% during 1996-2000. At the diploma level, the demand is expected to increase to&#13;
182,100 persons in 1995 and 333,200 in 2000, respectively. The average annual growth&#13;
rates are 16.6% during 1991-1995 and 12.9% during 1996-2000.&#13;
1.10        In the rapid growth case, the increases in the shares of S&amp;T employees are of&#13;
course faster than in the base case. Demand expands with the rapid growth of S&amp;T&#13;
manpower's share in total formal employment to reflect the recent situation in the labor&#13;
market where excess demand is dominant. Projected employment demand for employees&#13;
with S&amp;T certificates are 205,640 and 385,700 persons in 1995 and 2000. The expansion&#13;
rate is estimated at 14.5% during 1991-1995 and 13.4% during 1996-2000. Projected&#13;
employment demand for employees with diploma level are 237,670 and 552,960 persons in&#13;
1995 and 2000. The annual expansion rates range between 23% and 18.4% during 1991-&#13;
1995 and 1996-2000. Sectors which have high S&amp;T intensities in their demand structure are&#13;
electrical equipment/household appliances, construction, and other services.&#13;
1 .11       Manpower Supply. The supply of graduates at the vocational levels with an&#13;
industrial technical background is taken from the "Vocational Education Plan" of Department&#13;
of Vocational Education (DOVE), Rajamangala Institute of Technology (RIT) and the&#13;
Private Education Commission (Table 1.1). Only 37% of certificate graduates enter the labor&#13;
force in the base year, the remaining 63% are assumed to continue study at the diploma level.&#13;
About 88% of diploma graduates enter the labor market.&#13;

1.12        Table 1.2 illustrates the magnitude of the potential gap between the demand&#13;
and supply of technicians and skilled workers in Thailand, as derived from Annex 1. This&#13;
constraint is both immediate and acute. Today, most employers can find less-skilled blue-&#13;
collar workers but that supply is running into quantitative and qualitative limits. Shortages of&#13;
university trained technicians, engineers and scientists are posing severe constraints on&#13;
industry. The result is frequent job change and pressure on salaries, which are rising by up to&#13;
20% a year. Modern industries are requiring an increasing number of skilled workers and are&#13;
having to seek them from a proportionately smaller pool. This situation threatens Thailand's&#13;
competitiveness in some industries. Investors in labor-intensive industries such as textiles&#13;
already are diverting new investments to lower-wage countries such as China and Vietnam.&#13;
To enable Thailand to move increasingly into higher value-added technology-intensive&#13;
production as it loses its comparative advantage in low-cost labor-intensive industries, its&#13;
pool of skilled labor must increase through effective education and training programs. The&#13;
capital and technology intensity of manufacturing must increase in order to maintain&#13;
international competitiveness. The productivity of labor, little changed in more than a&#13;
decade, must rise.&#13;
II. VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION&#13;
A. The Vocational and Technical Education System&#13;
2.1         Vocational and technical education is a major component of Thailand's&#13;
education system. It is delivered through both public and private vocational colleges, and&#13;
provides almost as many places for lower secondary graduates as do the public and private&#13;
general secondary schools. In 1995, it consumed 9% of the national education budget (Table&#13;
2.2 and Annex 2). As industrialization accelerates, the VTE system is being called upon to&#13;
play a more critical role in the preparation of better-trained craftsmen and technicians, which&#13;
form the base of the technical skills pyramid.&#13;
2.2          Structure. The structure of the vocational and technical education system is&#13;
relatively complex, comprising both public and private institutions. The public network is&#13;
administered by several ministries, some of which offer both formal and nonformal training.&#13;
The Ministry of Education (MOE) plays the major role in this effort. Within the MOE, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Department of Vocational Education (DOVE) and the Rajamangala Institute of Technology&#13;
(RIT) (Chart 1) enroll approximately 60% of all vocational and technical students.  The&#13;
structure of the national education system and details of the VTE system are given in Charts&#13;
2 and 3 respectively. The structure of enrollments is also given by level (Chart 4) and type&#13;
(Chart 5).&#13;
2.3           Formal vocational and technical education is conducted at three levels:&#13;
secondary, leading to a three-year certificate equivalent to graduates of general secondary&#13;
schools3; post-secondary (generally for two years), leading to a diploma; and university level,&#13;
leading to a degree.  Secondary (certificate) and post-secondary (diploma) vocational&#13;
education is provided in technical, commercial and agricultural fields by the King Mongkut's&#13;
Institute of Technology (KMIT) under the Ministry of University Affairs, and by the RIT and&#13;
DOVE under the MOE. Private vocational schools also provide both certificate and diploma&#13;
programs in agriculture, commerce and industrial fields. These schools may follow either the&#13;
DOVE or RIT curriculum. Most formal institutions, both public and private, offer programs&#13;
at more than one level; for example, for both the certificate and the diploma, or in the case of&#13;
some of the campuses of the RIT, at the certificate, diploma and degree levels. In 1994,&#13;
DOVE and RIT institutions enrolled about 406,008 students in certificate, diploma and&#13;
degree programs (Table 2. 1). Admission at all levels is through competitive entrance&#13;
examinations developed and administered by each individual institution.&#13;
2.4           Nonformal training is offered by the MOE through DOVE's 46 polytechnics&#13;
and 54 industrial and community colleges and by the Department of Nonformal Education&#13;
(DNFE) through its 6,500 institutional/training groups. It is also offered by the Ministry of&#13;
Labor and Social Welfare through the Department of Skill Development's (DSD) ten&#13;
regional institutes and nine provincial skill training centers. The latter training is generally&#13;
targeted at more disadvantaged workers, with a duration ranging from 10 hours to 15&#13;
months.&#13;
2.5          MOE has a clear policy of gender equity in access to VTE institutions.&#13;
Enrollment of women in vocational education, although lagging somewhat behind men, has&#13;
shown marked signs of improvement in recent years. Women represented 50% of total&#13;
enrollments in 1994-95. For RIT, the female enrollment trends have been steadily increasing&#13;
at all levels since 1988 (Annex 3). The majority of female students in DOVE institutions are&#13;
enrolled in areas of commerce/business administration (90% of total enrollment in this field),&#13;
and home economics (97% of total enrollment). No discriminatory practices exist which&#13;
would discourage women from enrolling in trade and industry courses and the present&#13;
enrollment pattern is largely the result of the exercise of individual preferences.&#13;
3 Prior to 1981 Thai education was organized on a 4-3-3-3 basis: lower and upper primary levels of four&#13;
and three years, followed by two three year levels of secondary education. At that time, vocational&#13;
secondary completion required ten years of education; academic secondary 13. The 1981 reform put&#13;
vocational education on a par with secondary education, permitting vocational graduates to sit for university&#13;
entrance examinations.&#13;

2.6         Department of Vocational Education Institutions.  DOVE, under the&#13;
Ministry of Education, is the largest public provider of vocational and technical education,&#13;
with 277 vocational and technical schools/colleges under its jurisdiction. It administers&#13;
secondary (certificate) and post-secondary (diploma) level programs in three fields (technical,&#13;
commercial and agriculture) within the technical and vocational training colleges. In 1994,&#13;
an additional 10 new  colleges were under construction.  DOVE institutions enroll&#13;
approximately half of the total number of students enrolled in vocational schools at the&#13;
secondary level. A system of 100 polytechnics and industrial and community colleges (ICCs)&#13;
provide mainly short-course training to entry-level workers and for upgrading the basic skills&#13;
of existing workers (about 112,000 in 1994) and more formal training to upgrade&#13;
qualifications to the certificate level (about 12,500 in 1994).&#13;
2.7          King Mongkut's Institute of Technology. KMIT was established in 1971&#13;
as a science and technology institute, under the Ministry of University Affairs. It provides a&#13;
third institutional stream for certificate (5%), diploma (7%), and degree (88%) studies in&#13;
industrial technology. Both KMIT and DOVE are conducting pilot experiments with the&#13;
"dual training system." While the approaches vary in detail, the pilots have in common a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
combination of on-the-job training of employed workers with one- or two- day block release&#13;
periods per week for theoretical classroom training. The KMIT pilot is being done in&#13;
collaboration with a large auto assembler and also assisted by German aid; the DOVE project&#13;
serves a number of employers in provincial industrial areas.&#13;
2.8          Private Vocational Schools. Private vocational schools and colleges provide&#13;
an important flow of graduates at both certificate and diploma levels in agriculture,&#13;
commerce and some industrial fields. Private schools are registered with the Government,&#13;
which sets limits on the amount of tuition they can charge (para. 2.16). Tuition ceilings have&#13;
made it difficult for private schools to offer relatively expensive industrial subjects, although&#13;
some do. It is in commerce that private vocational schools outnumber public institutions&#13;
because of the lower investment cost required and the continuous successful placement rates&#13;
of their graduates. In 1994, private schools enrolled 50% of the students at the certificate&#13;
level, and 40% at the diploma level (Annex 4).&#13;
2.9                 Rajamangala Institute of Technology.  RIT is the other main&#13;
vocational training department operating under the Ministry of Education. Established in&#13;
1975, it administers eleven faculties in different disciplines, offering certificate and diploma&#13;
courses in varying combinations at 31 campuses (12 urban and 19 rural) located throughout&#13;
the Kingdom. At present, the RIT employs about 7,500 permanent staff, of which less than&#13;
10% are classified as administrative officers. Since 1981 four-year bachelor degree programs&#13;
in engineering, agriculture and business administration have been offered at ten campuses in&#13;
response to growing needs for higher-level technical manpower. This program is equivalent&#13;
to a university degree. However, credits earned in RIT or DOVE diploma programs are not&#13;
accepted in the universities, restricting vocational students to the degree programs of RIT&#13;
and the KMIT, or to the Open University, which accepts diploma credits in some programs.&#13;
In 1994, the RIT enrolled about 72,000 students (Annex 3) and all campuses are able to&#13;
maximize their enrollments every semester. Student dropouts are generally low and few&#13;
students repeat programs.  Placement rates for the RIT are quite high, although variable.&#13;
The rates range from about 80% to about 95%. In 1995, it is expected that RIT will&#13;
graduate about 6,000 persons from certificate programs, 15,000 with diplomas, and about&#13;
4,000 with degrees.&#13;
2.10         About 67% of RIT technical teachers have a B.S., 28% have masters degrees,&#13;
1% have Ph.D.s and less 4% have less than B.S. degrees. Most of these teachers have&#13;
limited or no industrial experience. Over the years, through inservice training and preservice&#13;
education, many have been trained in pedagogy including instructional methods, curriculum&#13;
development and instructional materials development. To upgrade the teaching force, RIT&#13;
has an active program under which foreign teachers are invited to teach and conduct research&#13;
and to share their expertise with RIT staff. During the past five years, RIT has had 20 to 30&#13;
foreign teachers/researchers in residence each year. To further complement this effort, RIT&#13;
staff are sent for short and long-term training both local and overseas: 30 annually for short-&#13;
term and 15 annually for long-term. RIT's overall student/teacher ratios range from 15 to 1&#13;
to 20 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.11        RIT is financed by the Government and through student fees. The 1995&#13;
budget for RIT is B2,278 million or about 2.1% of the MOE budget (Table 2.2). Students&#13;
generally pay fees ranging from B50 to B150 per credit hour. Most students take about 24&#13;
credit hours per semester. Depending upon their enrolled program, students pay between&#13;
10% and 20% of the unit costs for their programs. Added to that cost recovery, some&#13;
programs also offer a limited number of programs to industry in production work which is&#13;
financed through cost recovery. Some programs also require that students provide the cost&#13;
of some instructional supplies/materials. It is estimated that since 1990, about 17% of the&#13;
total RIT budget has come from sources (all other income) outside the Govemment budget.&#13;
This is a significant effort in cost recovery. Unit costs per year for RIT range widely for&#13;
technical programs. It is estimated that the costs for certificate and diploma students are&#13;
from about B9,000 to B15,000 per year and for engineering degree programs, B41,000 to&#13;
B65,000.&#13;
2.12         Vocational and Technical Teacher Training. Currently, there are about&#13;
25,000 technical and vocational teachers in the public formal VTE system. Technical teacher&#13;
training programs are offered by both RIT and KMIT, which have a combined annual output&#13;
of approximately 1,000. The program includes one-year pedagogical courses after the&#13;
technical diploma, and four-year courses leading to a bachelor's degree in industrial&#13;
education. Graduates are targeted to fill vacancies in public and private VTE institutions.&#13;
While the present staff turnover rate in the institutions is low (less than 2%), it has become&#13;
extremely difficult to recruit new teachers for existing vacancies and to staff new vacancies&#13;
where the VTE systems are being significantly expanded. This is due to the high level of&#13;
demand in a rapidly expanding economy for highly-skilled, technically qualified graduates&#13;
which are attracted to industry by relatively high salaries. To partially address this problem,&#13;
DOVE initiated at one of its technical colleges in 1990, a two-year technical teacher program&#13;
for students with a diploma in vocational education. The program was later expanded to&#13;
include eight other DOVE colleges in various parts of the country. Competitive entrance&#13;
examinations are required and, upon completion, students are awarded a bachelor of&#13;
technology degree.  Scholarships are available for selected students at B30,000 per&#13;
scholarship. These graduates are bonded to teach in DOVE institutions for four years.&#13;
2.13        Established  in  1989, under the administration  of DOVE, the Staff&#13;
Development Institute (SDI) is responsible for the inservice training of DOVE personnel.&#13;
SDI courses are short-term and subjects offered are limited. In 1995, SDI trained about&#13;
2,885 teaching staff or about 17% of all DOVE VTE teaching personnel (estimated at about&#13;
17,000 in 1995). An OECF project is currently assisting SDI in the development of longer&#13;
and more intensive training courses in advanced technology. Equipment, civil works (five&#13;
buildings), foreign consultants, English language training, and teaching scholarships are being&#13;
provided by OECF.&#13;
2.14         Financing. The public vocational education system is largely financed by&#13;
public revenues. Eighty percent of the costs of vocational schooling are provided by&#13;
government budgets. The remaining twenty percent is supported by tuition and fees paid by&#13;
students and their families. The fees, ranging from B50 to B80 per credit for certificates and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
diplomas, are the same regardless of the field of study, and thus represent varying portions of&#13;
total unit cost for different courses. In addition to official tuition, students and parents are&#13;
often required to make additional contributions to schools, usually as a condition of&#13;
enrollment. These contributions are not reported in official statistics, but can add twenty&#13;
percent or more to individual direct costs at the secondary level. Limited scholarships are&#13;
available to needy students. Scholarship funds are raised by headmasters through donations&#13;
from local businesses. To provide further financial assistance to lower-income families, the&#13;
Government has recently introduced a B 10 billion loan program. The interest rate is 3% and&#13;
repayments will be made through an additional income tax which is deferred until the&#13;
borrower has obtained employment. To qualify for the loans, annual family income must not&#13;
exceed B 100,000.&#13;
2.15         During 1992-1995, total expenditures for vocational education and training&#13;
averaged nearly 9% of total MOE budget (Table 2.2) and within this share, DOVE and RIT&#13;
resources grew steadily.  The estimated average unit cost per student was B14,439,&#13;
B 16,198, and B18,804 in 1990, 1992, 1993, respectively (for separate estimates of unit costs&#13;
for RIT, see Annex 3). This is expected to increase by about B2,000 per year throughout the&#13;
Seventh Plan. Tuition fees can be levied by vocational institutions but there is no specific&#13;
rate set by the Ministry of Finance. However, fees charged by these institutions should be&#13;
similar to the amount charged by academic upper secondary schools.&#13;
2.16         The MOE classifies private vocational schools according to their financial&#13;
standing: subsidized and non-subsidized. For private schools with a sound financial position,&#13;
no subsidy is given and MOE does not control the level of school fees. However, the tuition&#13;
fee charged by these schools should not exceed B3,900 per annum for lower secondary and&#13;
B4,300 per annum for upper secondary. For private subsidized vocational schools, the&#13;
tuition fees should not exceed B2,340 per annum for the lower secondary level and B2,580&#13;
per annum for the upper secondary level. There are two types of subsidized schools: (a)&#13;
those receiving 60% of the cost per head; and (b) those receiving 40% of the cost per head.&#13;
Currently, the latter type predominates. Private vocational schools which receive 60% are&#13;
usually connected with charitable or religious foundations, whereas the 40% subsidized&#13;
group are proprietary schools. A survey conducted by the National Education Commission&#13;
in 1986 found that approximately 75% of all private schools in the country received&#13;
subsidies, which averaged B350,000-B380,000 annually. In the Bangkok metropolitan&#13;
region, about 55% of the private vocational schools received subsidies, averaging around&#13;
B 170,000 per annum.&#13;

B. Issues in Vocational and Technical Education&#13;
2.17         The development of the VTE system in the course of the past two decades&#13;
has been a remarkable achievement.  The system's strengths include a high level of&#13;
commitment and professionalism among administrators, teachers and staff, high internal&#13;
efficiency, and good completion rates (85-95%).  Student/teacher ratios are generally&#13;
satisfactory. Placement rates are high, reflecting robust demand for skilled workers in the&#13;
economy. The system served the nation and the economy well until the early 1980s, when&#13;
new economic policies and opportunities led to the current pattern of rapid economic change.&#13;
2.18         In the medium term, the overall size of the system and its ability to respond&#13;
efficiently to the needs of a changing economy are sources of concern. The current&#13;
directions of the Thai economy indicate the presence of offsetting trends in the demand for&#13;
skilled workers and technicians. On the one hand, exposure to competition and growing&#13;
labor shortages will lead to increased capital investment and automation, tending to reduce&#13;
demand for skilled labor. On the other hand, the expansion of industry, growth in skill-&#13;
intensive small and medium enterprises and the expansion of infrastructure investment will&#13;
increase demand. The efficiency of VTE institutions will be increasingly determined by their&#13;
ability to identify and react quickly to these changes in the profile of skill demands.&#13;
Adjustment of the vocational education system, especially through upgrading skills of&#13;
technical teachers, is therefore needed to improve quality and flexibility in responding to&#13;
changing employment demand. In addition, measures are needed to address the following&#13;
issues: outdated equipment and facilities, rigid curriculum, absence of strong linkages with&#13;
industry, and lack of system-wide planning and coordination.&#13;
2.19         Technical Teachers. With the rapid expansion of VTE enrollments, the&#13;
inability of institutions to recruit sufficient numbers of fully qualified VTE teachers is become&#13;
increasingly serious, especially in the fields of electrical power, electronics, mechanics, and&#13;
computer science where many teachers qualified in these fields are reluctant to enter the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
teaching profession due to the availability of higher salaries in private industry. In some of&#13;
these industrial/commercial fields, salaries may be two to three times higher than those paid&#13;
for VTE teachers. Although teacher turnover is low (para 2.12), the shortages of highly&#13;
qualified technical teachers appears to be worsening as most VTE systems in the nation&#13;
expand in capacity and into higher technology program offerings. DOVE's estimate of the&#13;
annual demand for new VTE teachers exceeds 2,000 for technical teachers, 1,000 for&#13;
commercial teachers, and 800 for agricultural teachers. For those remaining in the teaching&#13;
force, many carry a heavy workload - ranging from 40 to 60 hours per week. Given the&#13;
marked differences in the salaries paid by industry/commerce relative to the public sector,&#13;
there is a need to consider incentives to attract VTE teachers and the training of larger&#13;
numbers to help reduce the teacher shortfall experienced within the various institutions.&#13;
2.20        Over the years the educational qualifications of vocational and technical&#13;
education teachers have improved as a result of continuing government commitment to&#13;
strengthening VTE and an effective teacher training system (para. 2.10). Within the RIT,&#13;
only 4% of teachers are diploma graduates and this is in line with the effort to increase&#13;
recruitment of staff with masters degrees to reflect the academic requirements for teaching&#13;
the bachelor degree courses offered on RIT campuses. Skill upgrading is urgently needed in&#13;
the RIT to enable teachers to effectively teach new technologies. These teachers also need to&#13;
have more opportunities to acquire industrial experience and to upgrade their academic&#13;
credentials.&#13;
2.21         Equipment and Facilities. The types of equipment in the RIT are reasonably&#13;
well balanced relative to the programs being offered. There are significant amounts of&#13;
medium to high technology equipment installed in the various campuses. A substantial&#13;
proportion of the medium technology equipment is obsolete and suffers from years of hard&#13;
use by students and less than adequate maintenance. This severely limits the quality and level&#13;
of instructional programs offered.&#13;
2.22         Although quite insufficient in quantity, the higher technology equipment is&#13;
generally up-to-date and well maintained. The lack of this equipment restrains RIT from&#13;
introducing new programs in line with changing technology in industry. There has been no&#13;
substantial capital investment in RIT campuses for a decade. Equipment is often purchased&#13;
not according to the skill level and degree of competence required by the curriculum but&#13;
rather in relation to the budget allocation. Recurrent budget support for repairs has been&#13;
constrained in recent years. Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) budgets are usually quite&#13;
small (estimated at less than 1% of recurrent budget) in most institutions. Consumable&#13;
materials are usually in short supply and are funded with inadequate budgets. Some cost&#13;
recovery is obtained from students who purchase supplies used in their studies, but the&#13;
amount is not sufficient to meet the needs. As a result, the supplies are often inadequate to&#13;
support the programs offered and the equipment base has aged through less than adequate&#13;
maintenance and a lack of replacement following depreciation.&#13;
2.23         Similarly, the design of buildings for the various institutions is often based less&#13;
on educational specifications and more on finance availability. Buildings among technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
institutions are diverse in design and functionality. Some are of excellent design and utility,&#13;
but many are old and the majority are in need of maintenance and upgrading.  Some&#13;
institutions are over-utilized in specific facility areas while under-utilized in others (typically,&#13;
workshops and laboratories). This is often results from an imbalance in the classroom to&#13;
workshop/laboratory capacity ratios, which, in turn, significantly reduces the instructional&#13;
capacity of the institution.&#13;
2.24         Curricula and Instructional Materials. There continues to be a need to&#13;
upgrade VTE curricula to meet the changing skill demands. Individual institutions also need&#13;
greater flexibility to adjust curricula to local skill needs. The curricula of DOVE and RIT are&#13;
centrally developed. The process of modifying such centrally determined curricula to reflect&#13;
changes in the demand for skills in the labor market, is bureaucratic and time consuming.&#13;
RIT curricula are developed by committees of teachers, subject matter experts and&#13;
curriculum specialists.5 Despite the demand for practically-trained technical VTE graduates,&#13;
the DOVE curriculum continues to allow students to take a broad range of general subjects&#13;
with little occupation-specific technical training. In theory, DOVE colleges have the right to&#13;
develop courses locally within the framework of electives. These have to be approved by&#13;
DOVE. It is reported that most DOVE institutions prefer to use the central curriculum&#13;
because of limited time and technical expertise for curriculum development. Approvals from&#13;
DOVE can be slow, taking six months to two years.&#13;
2.25         The general nature of the training combined with the system-wide inflexibility&#13;
in implementing curriculum changes responsive to the economic environment were major&#13;
factors leading to past overproduction of graduates in some areas and shortages in others. In&#13;
the late 1980s, there was an over-supply of graduates in commerce as DOVE and RIT&#13;
institutions offered such courses under similar curricula. At the same time, shortages of&#13;
graduates existed in areas of industrial technology where the intakes of existing institutions&#13;
were too small and could not be expanded in a timely manner.&#13;
2.26         Instructional materials development is provided primarily by the teachers of&#13;
the subjects. The development of instructional media and materials is done through an&#13;
Instructional Materials Development Center that is attached to the RIT Registrar's Office.&#13;
These materials generally support the core courses and new curricula that are formally&#13;
introduced. Additional audio-visual and written instructional materials are produced by the&#13;
instructor within their own institutions. Most institutions have some capacity for teachers to&#13;
produce their own audio-visual instructional aides and materials. Teachers have complained&#13;
that they do not have time to prepare their own materials, but the VTE administrations of&#13;
both DOVE and RIT are convinced that teachers should take a major responsibility for their&#13;
own instructional materials development. The MOE offers a course on the development of&#13;
instructional materials that all instructional staff are encouraged to take.  It has been&#13;
estimated that more than 60% of all VTE teachers in DOVE and RIT have been trained to&#13;
prepare their own instructional materials. Over the next five years, there will be a need to&#13;
upgrade curricula and develop more instructional materials for the higher-level technologies&#13;
being introduced by RMT.&#13;
5 For a more detailed description of the curriculum development system of RIT see Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.27         Linkages With Employment. Linkages with industry are often weak and&#13;
job information and placement services need strengthening.  In addition to centralized&#13;
curriculum development, the system has not established the types of linkages with employers&#13;
that facilitate the flow of labor market information which informs enrollment and curriculum&#13;
planning. The national Joint Public/Private Committee (JPPC), established in 1985 to&#13;
enhance participation of the private sector in vocational education, is chaired by the Prime&#13;
Minister and includes in its membership high ranking ministry officials and representatives of&#13;
the Thai Banking Association, the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Industrial&#13;
Association. However, the high status of committee members is reported to make operation&#13;
of the JPPC ineffective. The committee has had little impact on the operation of the training&#13;
system.&#13;
2.28         DOVE and RIT curriculum  policy requires students to do on-the-job&#13;
internships. However, the principal responsibility for finding internships rests with students.&#13;
Securing internship placements is difficult in a market where many firms are small. School&#13;
personnel get involved only if a student is unable to find an internship place. The problems of&#13;
establishing linkages of any kind with small firms are persistent. This may be a factor in&#13;
explaining the relatively low levels of enterprise participation in teaching and curriculum&#13;
development. In the latter case, of course, there is little school-level curriculum development&#13;
to which employers might contribute.&#13;
2.29        Both DOVE and RIT have established job information and placement services&#13;
for their students. DOVE has also taken steps to encourage linkage development, but&#13;
success has been hampered again by the prevalence of small firms and by the inability of&#13;
individual institutions to adjust their curricula to changing employment and training needs.&#13;
Furthermore, DOVE and RIT policies encourage the formation of local school advisory&#13;
committees. These committees have been difficult to establish, and have not been very&#13;
effective in DOVE schools. They appear to function better for urban schools (both public&#13;
and private) near large enterprises. Generally, there are few incentives for enterprises or&#13;
schools to invest much time or energy in linkage development.&#13;
2.30         Mechanisms to translate vocational education and training plans and priorities&#13;
into action at the institutional level are lacking.  The practice of using labor market&#13;
information as the basis for broad decisions on training priorities and resource allocations&#13;
need to be established in close coordination with various national planning agencies such as&#13;
NESDB and research centers such as TDRI.&#13;
2.31         Coordination, Planning and Management. The Thai vocational training&#13;
system still shows the characteristics of its rapid and uncoordinated growth in the 1970s and&#13;
early 1980s. Duplication of programs is widespread and overall planning and coordination is&#13;
inadequate to support structural change resulting from changing skill needs. Within each&#13;
sub-system, there is a high degree of centralization and little flexibility at the institutional&#13;
level. There is no unified vocational and technical education system in Thailand. A degree of&#13;
coordination exists: all systems draw on the teacher training programs of KMIT, RIT and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
universities for staff; and all use similar curricula. There are no formal mechanisms for joint&#13;
planning and coordination, although informal cooperation takes place within the Ministry of&#13;
Education. The JPPC, which was established to coordinate vocational education and training&#13;
policy, has not functioned effectively (para. 2.27).&#13;
2.32         As a result, equivalent training is offered by different agencies in the same&#13;
location. Certain professional support functions -- such as curriculum development, and in-&#13;
service teacher training are duplicated. DOVE and RIT systems are quite centralized.&#13;
Although institutions have considerable autonomy with respect to enrollments, staff hiring&#13;
and assignment and curriculum development are all administered centrally. Planning consists&#13;
of submission of budget requests from institutions, and authorizations and transfer of funds&#13;
from Bangkok.&#13;
C. Government's Policies and Plans&#13;
2.33         The Government's policies in VTE reflect the need to address the basic issue&#13;
of widespread skill shortages in the labor market as well as to improve the quality of training&#13;
and strengthen internal management of the VTE system. The Seventh Plan calls for a&#13;
substantial increase in the supply of technicians (para. 1.7) through the expansion of&#13;
institutional capacity.  This would result in a three-fold increase in total outputs from&#13;
200,000 during the Sixth Plan to 600,000 during the Seventh. However, one of the major&#13;
constraints to achieving this target is the shortage of technical teachers, resulting from the&#13;
demand for personnel with technical skills in industry. This problem has been approached by&#13;
developing a special teacher training course for vocational certificate holders accompanied by&#13;
scholarships for selected students (para. 2.12). This policy aims at increasing the supply of&#13;
qualified teachers but attention needs to be given to incentives to ensure their retention within&#13;
the VTE system.&#13;
2.34         The Seventh Plan calls for much closer cooperation between employers and&#13;
training institutions to ensure greater relevance of training to labor market needs. This is an&#13;
area where more effort needs to be made especially in making the overall policy body work&#13;
(para. 2.27) and in improving the facilitation of student on-the-job internships. The latter is&#13;
difficult in Thailand where small- and medium-scale firms predominate. Thus, more attention&#13;
needs to be given to providing the necessary incentives to employers to take on trainees.&#13;
2.35         There is also recognition in the Plan of the need to provide skill training for&#13;
the economically underprivileged in order to raise their incomes and promote self-&#13;
employment. This will be achieved through an expansion of formal and nonformal lower-&#13;
level skill training. An important part of this strategy is to strengthen the system of 100&#13;
polytechnics and ICCs which provide entry-level training and programs for skill upgrading&#13;
(para. 2.6). Trainees in the system are drawn heavily from the lower socio-economic groups.&#13;
It is planned to expand the system through the establishment of 25 new polytechnics/ICCs,&#13;
but the immediate priority is to improve the quality and relevance of training and to develop&#13;
more effective management of the system. The Bank's support for these efforts is being&#13;
sought through a planned Vocational Training Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.36         The Government is also concerned that adequate resources be available to&#13;
finance the planned expansion of the VTE system. This includes an increased role for the&#13;
private sector. The Plan calls for the removal of ceilings on tuition charges in private schools&#13;
to increase the financial viability of existing schools and to encourage new entrants to the&#13;
market. This is especially important in the VTE sector where entry costs are high. Private&#13;
schools will also be allowed more freedom in the teaching of curricula and will be allowed&#13;
more flexibility in management and administration. A major new incentive was announced&#13;
recently by the Government in the form of a B20 billion fund which will allow educational&#13;
entrepreneurs in the provinces to borrow up to 50% of the development costs of new schools&#13;
at subsidized interest rates.&#13;
2.37  It is expected that the Eighth Plan, which becomes effective in FY97, will continue to&#13;
stress the need to expand and improve the quality of VTE at all levels, place more emphasis&#13;
on improving the relevance of VTE to industry needs and to define a greater role for the&#13;
private sector in the provision of VTE.&#13;
I.L THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. Bank's Experience in Education&#13;
3.1         The Bank has assisted the development of Thailand's education system under&#13;
six loans/credits during the period 1966-82. Bank lending amounted to US$154 million or&#13;
about 35% of total project costs of US$453 million. The overall direction of Bank lending&#13;
under the six projects was consistent with education policy as it evolved under the first five&#13;
national plans (1962-86). The first two projects focused on increasing the supply of technical&#13;
manpower for industry and agriculture. Later projects had a broader educational focus and&#13;
were consistent with the major educational reforms, introduced in 1978, which aimed at&#13;
equality of educational opportunity, curriculum reform and improved management of the&#13;
education system. Consequently, the later projects focused on the expansion of educational&#13;
capacity in the rural areas, the introduction of diversified secondary curricula and the&#13;
strengthening of education management6.&#13;
3.2          The first education project in Thailand (Ln. 471-TH) supported quality&#13;
improvement and expansion of outputs in selected vocational institutions.  The project&#13;
financed construction, renovation and equipment for 24 trade, industrial and agricultural&#13;
schools and an agricultural teacher training college. The project also included technical&#13;
assistance for curriculum development and for upgrading teacher training. The PPAR for the&#13;
project (Report No. 770, June 13, 1975) concluded that the project was implemented&#13;
successfully. In general, overall enrollment and output targets were met and new well-&#13;
balanced curricula were introduced.  The technical assistance program was completed&#13;
successfully and this was due, in part, to close cooperation between overseas advisers and&#13;
6 For a detailed review of Bank assistance to Thailand under the six projects, see: Education Development&#13;
in Thailand: The Role of World Bank Lending, (Report No. 7306, June 24, 1988).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
local counterparts. Equipment procurement was delayed initially due to the late arrival of&#13;
advisers and this delay was exacerbated by cumbersome procurement procedures. These&#13;
problems were largely responsible for the project being completed four years behind&#13;
schedule. Some items of equipment were judged to be too sophisticated for the schools and,&#13;
in the case of some agricultural equipment, not relevant to local conditions. Some difficulty&#13;
was experienced in retaining teachers with practical industry-related experience because of&#13;
the demand for such skills in the labor market.&#13;
3.3          The second education project (Ln. 822-TH), assisted in upgrading education&#13;
and research in agriculture and related fields in Kasetsart (Agricultural) University and also&#13;
assisted its move to a new  rural campus.  The project financed site development,&#13;
construction, furniture and equipment, and technical assistance for curriculum development,&#13;
university management and project unit support. The PPAR for the project (Report No.&#13;
4563, June 17, 1983) concluded that the major objectives of the project were achieved&#13;
although project completion was nearly three years behind schedule. The latter was caused&#13;
partly by an unrealistic implementation schedule and also by design and construction delays in&#13;
the civil works component.  Targets for new  student places were met.  Equipment&#13;
procurement was fully satisfactory and the technical assistance program was also&#13;
implemented effectively. Regarding the latter, there was close cooperation between advisers&#13;
and local counterparts. The fellowship program resulted in a substantial increase in faculty&#13;
with graduate degrees.  One weakness in project implementation was that insufficient&#13;
attention was paid to educational aspects of the project institution such as changes in&#13;
admissions, enrollments, graduates and the employment experience of the latter. Thus there&#13;
was only limited understanding of the educational impact of the project.&#13;
3.4          The third education project (Cr. 369-TH) marked a shift in emphasis away&#13;
from the narrower focus of meeting technical manpower requirements towards improving&#13;
educational opportunities, especially in the provinces. The third project aimed to extend and&#13;
improve elementary teacher training facilities in the provinces, introduce a diversified&#13;
curriculum in rural secondary schools, improve educational research and curriculum design&#13;
and extend science programs and assist long range planning in the Prince of Songkla&#13;
University in the south of Thailand.  The project financed construction, furniture and&#13;
equipment for selected primary teachers' training colleges, rural high schools, a National&#13;
Curriculum Development Center (NCDC) and the Prince of Songkla University. Expert&#13;
services and fellowships were included under the project's technical assistance program. The&#13;
PPAR for the project (Report No. 4574, June 27, 1983), concluded that the project's&#13;
objectives were met, with the exception of the teacher training component. The diversified&#13;
curricula for the rural secondary schools were introduced successfully, the NCDC was&#13;
operating effectively (although it could benefit from a sharpening of the focus of its research&#13;
function), the university science programs were improved and their quantitative targets&#13;
virtually achieved. Expansion of rural teacher training opportunities was achieved but not to&#13;
the extent envisaged. Initially, there was a substantial underestimation in teacher supply and&#13;
the Government reduced teachers' college intakes because of the emerging over-supply.&#13;
Thus project-assisted colleges were underutilized. This situation was identified soon after&#13;
appraisal and project design should have been rectified accordingly. The technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
program was generally successful but there was a need to monitor fellows on their return to&#13;
ensure that they entered positions relevant to their training. There was also a need to observe&#13;
a realistic mix between short study tours and long-term study for higher degrees. The latter&#13;
may not always be the most appropriate method of acquiring skills in certain fields (e.g.&#13;
curriculum development). The project closed 3.5 years behind schedule, due in part to&#13;
problems in the functioning of the project implementation unit, which lacked clearly-defined&#13;
jurisdiction and authority.&#13;
3.5          The fourth education project (Ln. 1271 -TH), continued support for the&#13;
expansion of diversified secondary education in the provinces and assisted in the&#13;
establishment of a national adult education system.  The project financed construction,&#13;
furniture, equipment and technical assistance for 50 diversified secondary schools and for&#13;
four regional and 24 provincial adult education centers. The project completion report&#13;
(PCR) for the project (Report No. 5710, June 14, 1985), concluded that the project was a&#13;
success with quantitative targets reached or surpassed.  Project implementation was&#13;
facilitated by the establishment of a well-staffed Central Project Unit (CPU), which was given&#13;
the authority to simplify procurement procedures. The technical assistance program was&#13;
implemented successfully and the individuals who received degree fellowships were, in the&#13;
majority of cases, serving in relevant posts. Some difficulties were experienced in the&#13;
preparation of equipment lists and specifications for the adult education component due to a&#13;
lack of expertise in this area. The project was completed just over two years behind schedule&#13;
due partly to scarcity of counterpart funds and shortage of experienced implementation staff&#13;
in adult education.&#13;
3.6          The fifth education project (Cr. 913-TH), continued support for expanding&#13;
educational opportunities in rural areas and for strengthening management of the education&#13;
system and public administration in general. The project provided for the establishment of 12&#13;
centralized vocational workshops to serve local secondary schools, the upgrading of&#13;
vocational programs in 42 rural secondary schools, expansion of educational radio programs&#13;
and the creation of inservice management training institutes for educational administrators&#13;
and civil servants. The project was implemented successfully and closed on schedule. The&#13;
PPAR for the project (Report No. 7284, June 17, 1988) concluded that a strong CPU served&#13;
successfully as a coordinator and resource center for the individual implementing agencies.&#13;
In general the quantitative targets of the project were met. However, lack of thorough&#13;
analysis of the catchment areas for the centralized vocational workshops led to&#13;
underutilization of some centers. The overseas fellowship program was generally successful&#13;
but there were some initial problems with the language competence of fellows and some&#13;
instances of fellows not being retained in the positions for which they had been trained.&#13;
3.7          The sixth education project (Ln. 2178-TH), aimed to extend support for&#13;
increasing educational opportunities in disadvantaged areas to the lower secondary level and&#13;
to strengthen education planning and management. The project financed the upgrading of&#13;
480 rural lower secondary schools through the addition of classrooms and workshops and the&#13;
inservice training of about 6,000 teaching and non-teaching staff. Technical assistance was&#13;
provided for fellowships and experts in the fields of education planning and management. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
program of eight studies covering key educational issues was also included in the project.&#13;
The project was completed on schedule but over-estimation of project costs led to the&#13;
cancellation of about 42% of the loan amount. The PCR for the project (Report No. 8363,&#13;
February 12, 1990) concluded that while the physical aspects of the project were&#13;
implemented successfully, educational objectives were not fully achieved. Enrollments in&#13;
project schools at project completion were 34% below target due to overly optimistic&#13;
enrollment projections at appraisal and to other factors such as high tuition and opportunity&#13;
costs for students. Transition rates to lower secondary education also declined. The local&#13;
inservice training program was generally successful but there were problems in the overseas&#13;
fellowship component regarding deficient language competencies and inadequate academic&#13;
standards for entry to overseas institutions. The planning and management component was&#13;
the least successful because it required significant organizational and policy changes which&#13;
could not be achieved within the scope of a single project but required a sustained high-level&#13;
policy dialogue between the Bank and Government. The program of studies would have&#13;
benefited from a synthesis of their findings and the translation of these into an action plan.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Experience&#13;
3.8          Some of the lessons learned from  experience under previous education&#13;
projects in Thailand, although implemented mainly in the seventies and early eighties, remain&#13;
relevant to the proposed project. For example, a well-staffed central implementation unit&#13;
with appropriate links to participating RIT institutions is essential to ensure successful&#13;
project implementation. Another major factor in achieving successful implementation is the&#13;
involvement of local officials in project design. During the previous period of Bank lending&#13;
for education (1966-82), design of the earlier projects tended to be dominated by Bank staff&#13;
and the local sense of "ownership" was minimal. However, later projects involved a much&#13;
greater participation of local officials with the result that project implementation was more&#13;
effective. In addition, other relevant lessons drawn from Bankwide experience include the&#13;
need for: (a) VTE curricula to be closely linked to the demonstrated needs of the labor&#13;
market; (b) timely identification of overseas training programs and placement of selected&#13;
candidates; (c) special attention to project management and implementation arrangements for&#13;
inexperienced borrowers; (d) intensive Bank supervision in a more facilitating rather than&#13;
monitoring nature during the early stages of implementation, and (e) a proper balance of&#13;
skills on supervision missions. These lessons are included in the design of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
C. Bank's Assistance Strategy&#13;
3.9         The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Thailand, (Report No.&#13;
13458-TH), which was presented to the Board on September 22, 1994, recognizes that&#13;
Thailand needs selective policy and technical advice and financing. Hence, Bank assistance&#13;
aims at providing value added in terms of helping to address the most important development&#13;
issues, many of which are cross-sectoral and involve the provision of public goods. These&#13;
key development priorities, on which Bank assistance would be focused, are: physical&#13;
infrastructure provision, human resource development, poverty reduction and improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
in income distribution, and natural resource and environmental management. The CAS&#13;
envisaged a lending program of around US$300 million per year during FY96-98 in these&#13;
priority areas. It was also indicated in the CAS that strong interest on the part of the&#13;
Government in priority areas such as the social sectors could lead to increased lending. With&#13;
respect to education, this interest has been declared by the Government through&#13;
communications with the Bank, in public pronouncements and through the high priority being&#13;
given to education in the Eighth Plan. Consequently, a number of projects were identified&#13;
which focused on sector priorities in education.&#13;
3.10        The proposed project would assist in human resource development.&#13;
Thailand's economic success has been built on the expansion of manufactured exports,&#13;
facilitated by substantial foreign direct investment. This export-led growth strategy is now&#13;
under pressure due to rising real wages, and skill shortages, coupled with economic&#13;
liberalization in labor-abundant economies such as China, Vietnam and India. A key&#13;
determinant of Thailand's continued economic success, therefore, will be its ability to upgrade&#13;
products and processes towards greater technological sophistication. Whether this can be&#13;
achieved quickly depends critically upon the availability of skilled and educated labor.&#13;
However, past under-investment in secondary, higher and technical education, together with&#13;
sectoral policy and institutional weaknesses, have meant that labor quality constraints have&#13;
become increasingly serious.&#13;
Education Lending Strategy&#13;
3.11        In recent years, post-primary education in Thailand has been unable to meet&#13;
the demands of a rapidly expanding economy for technical skills and for workers with a&#13;
sound general education. This has retarded productivity growth while skill shortages have&#13;
pushed up wages thereby putting pressure on the country's competitiveness.  The&#13;
Government has responded with policies that call for the expansion of technical and scientific&#13;
education to increase the supply of skills at all levels and also for the expansion of general&#13;
secondary education to increase the education level of entrants to the workforce and to&#13;
expand the numbers of potential entrants to higher education. A key concern underlying this&#13;
expansion is the need to maintain (and preferably improve) the quality of education in the&#13;
face of rapidly expanding enrollments.&#13;
3.12        The Bank made its last loan for education to Thailand in 1982 in support of&#13;
developing lower secondary education (para. 3.7). This was followed by a Government&#13;
policy of not seeking Bank financing in the social sectors. In 1990-91 the Bank prepared an&#13;
in-depth review of vocational education and a review of key issues in education.  These&#13;
reviews were well-received in Thailand but did not lead to any discernible action to&#13;
implement the policy recommendations contained therein. The Bank was in no position to&#13;
push a policy agenda at that time because it lacked the leverage of a lending program in&#13;
education. However in 1993, recognizing the growing inadequacies in the education system,&#13;
the Government asked the Bank to look at the possibilities of restarting lending to education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
3.13          The education lending strategy is based on the assumption that if the Bank is&#13;
to make a meaningful impact on sector development, we must be engaged for the long term.&#13;
In line with the CAS, this means that we must be in a position to offer policy advice and, to&#13;
be realistic, it must be combined with lending operations if the Bank is to have a significant&#13;
impact on policy improvements. Our lending strategy will follow three stages. The first&#13;
stage would cover the design of initial lending operations and would constitute the Bank's re-&#13;
entry into the sector. Initial lending would assist in raising the quality of technical and&#13;
scientific education in technical institutions and public universities and in supporting the&#13;
expansion of secondary education in three strategic subjects - science, mathematics and&#13;
English.  Such assistance would contribute to the production of better-trained skilled&#13;
workers, technicians, engineers and scientists, and better-educated outputs from  the&#13;
secondary schools. This would address directly one of the critical development problems in&#13;
Thailand, namely, the severe shortages of technically skilled and educated manpower. Thus&#13;
proposed initial Bank assistance is fully consistent with Thailand's development priorities and&#13;
with the Bank's assistance strategy. The strategic thrust outlined above has been refined into&#13;
five proposed projects - Universities Science and Engineering Education, Secondary&#13;
Education Quality Improvement (SEQI) I and II, Technical Education and Vocational&#13;
Training.7   The main focus in the projects is on quality improvement through staff&#13;
development, modernization of laboratories and workshops, curricula upgrading and&#13;
improved learning materials.&#13;
3.14          The second stage calls for the preparation of a policy-oriented sector study to&#13;
be completed by the Bank in FY97. A number of sound education policies relating to system&#13;
expansion and quality improvement are currently being implemented and the three proposed&#13;
projects would support these policies.  These ongoing policies provide an adequate&#13;
framework for the effective implementation of the projects and for the sustainability of their&#13;
outcomes. With respect to VTE, current policies (paras. 2.33-2.36) call for the expansion of&#13;
skill training at all levels including an expanded role for private institutions. Special attention&#13;
will be given to the needs of lower income groups for entry-level and skill-upgrading training.&#13;
A special program has been introduced to increase the supply of technical teachers to&#13;
alleviate the outflow of teachers to industry. The design of the proposed project (paras. 4.6-&#13;
4.12) is clearly consistent with these policies.&#13;
3.15          However, in addition to current policies which are pursuing expansion and&#13;
quality improvement, there are a number of more complex policy issues which,&#13;
administratively and politically, are proving difficult to resolve. This difficulty is reflected in&#13;
the fact that the issues are well-known and regularly debated, but reaching a consensus aimed&#13;
at their resolution has eluded policy-makers to date. They include: (a) the need to rationalize&#13;
the present complex structure of VTE in terms of simplifying its management structure,&#13;
improving coordination and planning capabilities, and reducing wasteful duplication of&#13;
7 Three projects were originally identified. However, certain components in the SEQI Project and the VTE&#13;
Project were ready for appraisal ahead of other components of the projects. Thus teacher education was&#13;
appraised as SEQI I with the schools component becoming SEQI IL. The higher-level technical education&#13;
component in the VTE Project became the Technical Education Project while the basic skill training&#13;
component became the Vocational Training Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
programs; (b) making the VTE system more relevant to industry's needs for skilled&#13;
manpower and improving the flexibility of the system to ensure that it can respond effectively&#13;
to rapidly changing technology; (c) developing incentives to retain technical teachers in the&#13;
face of rising demand from an expanding private sector and formulating a long-term plan for&#13;
ensuring an adequate supply of trained technical teachers; (d) improving cost recovery in&#13;
public sector institutions and defining an appropriate role for the private sector in the&#13;
provision of training. This introduces a number of issues relating to incentives, high cost of&#13;
entry, maintenance of standards, overall level of regulation, etc. The proposed sector study&#13;
would analyze these issues (and others to be identified) and propose appropriate solutions.&#13;
Terms of reference for the study were prepared during appraisal and were agreed with the&#13;
8&#13;
Government during negotiations.&#13;
3.16         The sector review  would form  the basis of a policy dialogue with the&#13;
Government, which would be monitored during implementation of the ongoing projects.&#13;
Recommendations aimed at addressing major problems would be defined and set out in an&#13;
education sector strategy. This strategy would be prepared by the Government and would&#13;
guide future improvements in education. It would also serve to guide the policy content of&#13;
future projects. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the education&#13;
sector strategy would be available for review by the Bank by March 1997 and that progress&#13;
in the implementation of the strategy would be reviewed in conjunction with the Bank by&#13;
March 1999. Thus, the third stage of Bank lending would encompass follow-up projects&#13;
which would include policy content drawn from the Government's sector strategy. It is&#13;
expected that follow-up projects would continue to support quality improvement in science&#13;
and technical education. The unmet needs are substantial and continued concentration of&#13;
effort by the Bank would ensure that a meaningful impact would be made in these areas.&#13;
Project design would emphasize monitoring and evaluation of policy improvements.&#13;
3.17         The Bank's strategy aims for long-term involvement in the education sector.&#13;
Through continued policy dialogue and carefully targeted lending operations, the&#13;
Government and the Bank would work towards a cost-effective, well-managed education&#13;
system which would meet the skill needs of an expanding economy and service the broader&#13;
needs of a rapidly modernizing society. The initial projects would provide a way for the&#13;
Bank to re-enter the education sector and to address quickly some obvious needs for quality&#13;
improvement within the context of the existing policy framework.  This would be&#13;
accompanied by a policy dialogue, based on sector work, which would analyze major&#13;
problems and propose solutions.&#13;
8 The sector study will: (a) define the broad objectives of the education system; (b) review education&#13;
policies and assess their effectiveness in achieving sector objectives; (c) identify policy problems which are&#13;
not currently being resolved; (d) analyze the reasons (administrative, political, socio-economic, cultural) for&#13;
the lack of resolution; (e) make policy recommendations for major improvements in the education system;&#13;
and (f) formulate a strategy for implementing these recommendations.&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin of the Project&#13;
4.1          The Government requested the Bank in late 1993 to examine the possibility of&#13;
project assistance to education. In conjunction with the Government, the Bank identified a&#13;
project which would strengthen technical education in selected RIT campuses and also&#13;
improve vocational training in the polytechnics/ICC system. Most of the preparation work&#13;
was completed by the Government according to guidelines formulated by the Bank.&#13;
Preparation of the RIT component proceeded at a faster pace than the polytechnics/ICC&#13;
component and it was decided to appraise RIT as a separate project (para 3.13). The project&#13;
was appraised in May 1995. Project processing was delayed following elections in July 1995&#13;
and the installation of a new Government.&#13;
B. Project Background and Rationale&#13;
4.2          The education sector in Thailand is relatively well-endowed with resources,&#13;
education accounting for about 3.6% of GNP compared with the average for East Asia of&#13;
around 3%. Thus the Government has requested the Bank's assistance not primarily for the&#13;
resource transfer itself, but to ensure that priority needs are met through the efficient&#13;
targeting of resources and that value added is provided through project assistance.  The&#13;
proposed project is a response to the Government's request for assistance.   As&#13;
industrialization accelerates in Thailand, the VTE system must be able to adapt to the&#13;
demand for more advanced technical skills at all levels. The Bank produced a major study of&#13;
VTE in Thailand in 1991, which identified the need for continuous skill upgrading through&#13;
quality improvement, as an important priority in human resource development.9  The&#13;
proposed project, building on available sector analysis, supports the Government's efforts to&#13;
raise the quality of technical education. The project would finance a package of quality-&#13;
improving investments which would strengthen instructor training, modernize laboratories&#13;
and workshops, upgrade curricula, and improve the project management capacities of the&#13;
RIT, which is a major delivery system providing technical certificate, diploma and&#13;
undergraduate degrees. This focus on quality improvement would complement the RIT's&#13;
expansion of training capacity and help to maintain standards of training in a period of&#13;
growth.&#13;
4.3          The Bank offers a strong comparative advantage in assisting the RIT to&#13;
improve all levels of technical education. This advantage has been gained from decades of&#13;
cross-country experience in technical education and it is reinforced, in Thailand, by the&#13;
Bank's knowledge of issues in VTE acquired through sector work. Thus, the project is the&#13;
logical follow-up to previous sector work and provides the investments needed to support&#13;
identified quality improvements in the technical education subsector.  Furthermore, the&#13;
project's focus on craftsman and technician training in RIT complements OECF operations&#13;
which are assisting the upgrading of middle-level training in DOVE's vocational colleges.&#13;
9 "Vocational Training in a Changing Economy: The Case of Thailand" (1991).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
4.4           The project is consistent with the Government's priority for developing&#13;
technical and scientific skills and with the Bank's country assistance strategy which identifies&#13;
human resource development as one of the key priorities. Regarding the latter, the CAS&#13;
emphasizes the vital need to develop technical skills if export competitiveness and long-term&#13;
growth are to be sustained. The project is also consistent with the Bank's education lending&#13;
strategy in Thailand. This calls for the development of initial lending operations to make an&#13;
early contribution in the crucial area of quality improvement while leaving major policy&#13;
changes to be identified in policy-oriented sector work (scheduled for completion in FY97)&#13;
and incorporated by the Government in an education sector strategy. This strategy would&#13;
guide future improvements in education and also serve as a guide to the policy content of&#13;
future projects. The value added embodied in the proposed project lies, in part, in its&#13;
addressing immediate investment needs in technical education thereby helping to alleviate the&#13;
backlog of investments in quality improvement. There is also value added in the Bank,&#13;
working in partnership with MOE, applying its rigorous project design techniques to&#13;
identifying quality-improving investments and in packaging them into a coherent project&#13;
design, which can be implemented efficiently. Finally, value would be added through the&#13;
Bank's assistance in identifying needed policy changes and in supporting their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
4.5           In support of the Government's overall strategy to modernize the VTE system&#13;
with the aim  of making it more relevant and responsive to the changing needs of the&#13;
economy, the overall objective of the proposed project would be to improve the quality of&#13;
technical education programs in 11 selected RIT campuses.10 Specifically, the project would&#13;
aim to: (a) improve the management capacity within the RITs; (b) strengthen curricula and&#13;
linkages with industry; (c) upgrade workshops and laboratories through the provision of up-&#13;
to-date equipment and physical improvements to buildings; (d) expand the supply and&#13;
upgrade the quality of instructional materials; and (e) strengthen the practical skills of key&#13;
teaching staff in advanced technologies through overseas training.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
4.6           The project would comprise components required to upgrade the 11 RIT&#13;
campuses as described below. The project would finance an institutional improvement&#13;
program (estimated baseline cost, US$1.3 million) which would include overseas training for&#13;
administrators and teaching staff, and consultant services for project management and&#13;
procurement. The project would also include the acquisition of up-to-date equipment for&#13;
modernizing laboratories and workshops (US$35.4 million) which would be complemented&#13;
by the provision of curriculum development (US$0.1 million), instructional materials&#13;
10 The campuses were selected on the basis that thev: (a) provided a wide level of geographic participation;&#13;
(b) were geographically located near heavy industrial areas and would be capable of developing strong&#13;
linkages with the major industries of the region; (c) had a core of teachers with the academic knowledge and&#13;
technical skills to teach higher-level technologies; (d) offered instructional programs at certificate, diploma,&#13;
and degree levels; and (e) were targeted for upgrading in accordance with the policies of MOE and RIT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
development and acquisition (US$3.6 million), and the improvement of O&amp;M systems within&#13;
the RIT (US$0.7 million). Refurbishment of facilities (US$9.4 million) would be included to&#13;
upgrade existing laboratories and workshops to ensure that the project-financed equipment&#13;
would be adequately accommodated and that practical teaching facilities would be available&#13;
to improve further the quality of service delivery.&#13;
Institutional Improvement (US$1.3 million)&#13;
4.7   (a)    To improve the skills of RIT's instructors in relation to modern industrial&#13;
practices, the project would finance 3 months of overseas training for 80&#13;
senior staff in state-of-the-art technology in selected fields, to be identified by&#13;
the staff Each of these persons would study the new technologies in their&#13;
area of specialization.  They would also be taught the modern methods&#13;
required to teach the new skills to others. This sub-component would include&#13;
a total of 240 months of overseas training.&#13;
(b)    To strengthen the project management capacity of the central Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) and the 11 RIT project institutions, key RIT&#13;
central office staff and senior instructors of RIT campuses would visit similar&#13;
institutions and projects in other countries to study modern project and&#13;
institutional management practices, including techniques for establishing&#13;
linkages with industry. The exposure to alternative management systems is&#13;
necessary as most staff have not had project or institutional management&#13;
experience outside Thailand. This sub-component would include a total of&#13;
one month of overseas training for 12 RIT management staff Staff training is&#13;
summarized in Annex 5.&#13;
(c)    To ensure efficient project management and implementation, the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) in RIT would be assisted by a foreign procurement&#13;
consultant for 12 months after project start-up to assist in the initial&#13;
equipment procurement activities and training of local staff.  Terms-of&#13;
reference for the consultant have been agreed.&#13;
Equipment (US$35.4 million)&#13;
4.8          To improve the quality and relevance of technical training to meet industry's&#13;
needs, the project would upgrade equipment in 11 RIT campuses. Preliminary equipment lists&#13;
and outline specifications by field of specialization have been prepared for the 11 campuses&#13;
and are acceptable to the Bank. Annex 6 contains a list of the fields of specialization by&#13;
project institution. The equipment has a strong focus on areas of more advanced technology&#13;
especially in electronics, communications, electrical and mechanical power and computers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Curriculum Development (US$0.1 million)&#13;
4.9          The upgrading of workshops and laboratories and the advanced training of&#13;
key teaching staff would lead to an improved learning environment. This would be further&#13;
reinforced by updating the curricula for those courses where new equipment and technologies&#13;
are introduced. The curricula would be developed utilizing the well-established policies and&#13;
procedures of RIT. These aim at keeping RIT abreast with technological changes in industry&#13;
and adjusting its programs to meet evolving skill needs. The project would finance about 60&#13;
months of local consulting services to support this effort.&#13;
Instructional Materials (US$3.6 million)&#13;
4.10        As curricula are upgraded for the courses where new  equipment and&#13;
technologies are being introduced, instructional materials would also need to be upgraded to&#13;
support the delivery of teaching services. This upgrading would include the development and&#13;
preparation of custom-made audio/visual materials, video tape instructional packages,&#13;
individualized competency-based instructional materials, and other relevant materials. In&#13;
addition, the project would also provide technical reference materials, textbooks, journals and&#13;
technical catalogues.  During the first two years of the project, instructional materials&#13;
development would be done by teams/workshops of senior teachers with the assistance of the&#13;
RIT Instructional Materials Development Center.  Each participating institution would&#13;
identify the materials needed to support its programs.&#13;
Operations and Maintenance (US$0.7 million)&#13;
4.11         As much of the equipment being purchased by the project supports higher&#13;
level technologies, it is vitally important that improvements be made to the operations and&#13;
maintenance systems currently utilized by RIT, particularly as they relate to the larger, more&#13;
expensive equipment units. Also, it is expected that the project will experience relatively high&#13;
initial O&amp;M costs as the new higher technology equipment is delivered, installed, calibrated,&#13;
monitored and tested. The project funds would be utilized to support the increased O&amp;M&#13;
costs for the higher technology equipment. These costs would include materials, spare parts,&#13;
supplies, services and other associated expenditure required to operate and maintain the tools&#13;
and equipment of the 11 participating campuses over the duration of the project. A small&#13;
portion of the funds (US$50,000) would also be used to finance workshops, seminars and&#13;
other costs associated with the refinement of the O&amp;M and instructional management&#13;
policies and procedures within RIT. Each campus director would be responsible for the&#13;
planning and implementation of the workshops/seminars. Some funds (US$100,000) would&#13;
also be included for the operations of the P113, mainly desktop computers and other office&#13;
equipment.&#13;
Civil Works for Refurbishment of Facilities (US$9.4 million)&#13;
4.12         In order to upgrade teaching facilities in general, and more specifically, to&#13;
ensure that the new equipment, provided under to project, would be adequately&#13;
accommodated, it would be necessary to refurbish many existing workshops and laboratories&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
in the selected project institutions.  Refurbishment activities would not involve land&#13;
acquisition or resettlement. During negotiations, the Government informed the Bank that&#13;
the individual institutional plans for the refurbishing of physical facilities (including the timing&#13;
of construction and linkages to equipment procurement) have been completed and were&#13;
approved by the President of RIT on June 15, 1995. The plans have been reviewed by the&#13;
Bank and found to be satisfactory.&#13;
V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Costs&#13;
Summary of Costs&#13;
5.1         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$52.7 million equivalent&#13;
(B11,318.3 million), including contingencies. The estimated cost by category of expenditure is&#13;
summarized in Table 5.1. Detailed costs and expenditures are provided in Annex 7.&#13;
Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
5.2         Base costs are estimated at April 1996 prices. The estimates for civil works&#13;
are in line with costs that were incurred, within Thailand, for similar types of construction&#13;
projects. Estimates for the costs of equipment and supplies/materials are based on current&#13;
prices for similar imported or locally available items. Costs for local and intemational&#13;
consultants are in line with recent education and training projects for appropriately qualified&#13;
experts. Unit costs for short term (3 months) foreign technical teacher training are estimated&#13;
at US$4,500 per month, including airfare, cost of living and training costs. Study tours&#13;
overseas are estimated at US$5,000 per month for one month trips.&#13;
5.3         Price contingencies of US$2.2 million (about 4% of baseline costs) were&#13;
calculated for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the following expected annual&#13;
average price increase percentages: foreign cost, 2.4% in FY96 and thereafter and local cost,&#13;
4.5% p.a. throughout.&#13;
5.4         The foreign exchange component of US$36.5 million, representing 69% of&#13;
total project costs, has been calculated on the basis of the following foreign exchange&#13;
percentages: (a) equipment - 80%; (b) civil works - 40%, (c) local consultants - 20%; (d)&#13;
instructional materials - 50%; (e) O&amp;M - 20%; and (f) foreign consultants and overseas&#13;
training - 90%;&#13;

B. Financing&#13;
5.5            The total project cost of US$52.7 million equivalent would be financed by a&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$31.6 million equivalent, covering about 60% of total project&#13;
costs excluding taxes. The Government would be responsible for the remaining 40% or US$&#13;
21.1 million. The loan would be a fixed rate single currency loan, payable in 15 years with&#13;
three years of grace and would carry the Bank's standard US dollar fixed rate for 12 years&#13;
maturity. The loan would finance 90% of the total cost of overseas training, 80% for&#13;
equipment, and 25% for instructional materials. About 87% of the foreign exchange cost of&#13;
the project would be financed by the loan.&#13;

equipment-related consumable materials and O&amp;M estimated at US$0.26 million in each of the&#13;
1I participating institutions. These additional expenditures could be accommodated by the&#13;
institutions without difficulties.&#13;
C. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
5.7          The overall responsibility for project management and implementation would&#13;
lie with MOE. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) would be established to provide policy&#13;
guidance and general oversight of the project and it would carry out similar functions for all&#13;
education projects financed by the Bank and other donors. A Project Coordinating Unit&#13;
(PCU) with a staff of six (including a project management adviser) would be established and&#13;
would be responsible for coordinating the implementation of education projects financed by&#13;
the Bank and other donors. The PCU would also serve as the secretariat of the PSC.&#13;
5.8          Detailed implementation of the proposed project would be the responsibility&#13;
of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the RIT. The RIT Vice President for&#13;
Research and Training would be the Director of the PIU and the Dean, Faculty of&#13;
Engineering of RIT would be the Project Manager. The Project Manager would be in&#13;
charge of day-to-day implementation activities. The PIU would have a core staff of 22&#13;
drawn from RIT's specialized divisions and campuses. Additional staff may be drawn from&#13;
other divisions, if necessary. The PIU would organize task forces (or groups) for ad-hoc&#13;
assignments, with members drawn from RIT campuses for short periods. The staff of the&#13;
PIU would be organized into four functional units responsible respectively for procurement,&#13;
disbursements, training and fellowships, and general administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The establishment of the PCU and the PIU and their staffing with key personnel&#13;
would be a condition of effectiveness. The Project Manager would be assisted by a Project&#13;
Operating Committee (POC), chaired by the RJT Vice President for Research and Training,&#13;
to provide advice and assistance on operational issues. Membership and terms of reference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
for the PSC, PIU, PCU and POC have been agreed and are included in a working Working&#13;
Paper. An organization chart for project management is presented in Annex 8 and the&#13;
implementation schedule in Annex 9.&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
5.9          The advanced stage of project preparation would allow implementation to&#13;
commence immediately after loan signing. Project institutions have been identified and&#13;
equipment lists and specifications prepared. Project management authorities have been&#13;
identified and competent staff are available to handle implementation activities.&#13;
Implementation arrangements have been agreed.&#13;
D. Monitoring and Review&#13;
5.10         In view of MOE's lack of recent experience with Bank-funded projects,&#13;
above-average supervision coefficients of about 15 staff weeks per year would be required in&#13;
the first 2-3 years of project implementation. The Bank would supervise the project three&#13;
times annually during the first 2-3 years of project implementation. It is expected that the&#13;
remaining years would require two missions each year with a third being scheduled only if&#13;
necessary. Supervision missions would also monitor progress in preparing the education&#13;
sector policy study (paras. 3.14-3.15) and the policy dialogue between the Bank and the&#13;
Government, which would follow from the sector study. Overall implementation would be&#13;
the responsibility of the task manager who would be assisted by a procurement expert to&#13;
handle equipment and an operations officer to oversee the implementation of the training and&#13;
fellowship programs. Annex 10 presents a Bank supervision plan for the project.&#13;
5.11         Key performance indicators have been developed and were agreed upon&#13;
during appraisal.  The indicators (Annex 11) would be utilized to monitor project&#13;
performance and to gain some insight into project impact. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed to integrate the indicators into the overall monitoring system and use&#13;
them systematically as part of project supervision. The indicators may be modified and&#13;
adjusted as implementation progresses. During negotiations, the Government also provided&#13;
assurances that, in conjunction with the Bank, it would undertake an annual review of project&#13;
progress on the basis of the agreed monitorable indicators.  This review  would be&#13;
documented in an annual progress report and would be provided to the Bank for review and&#13;
comments within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year. The third annual review&#13;
would include a detailed assessment of implementation experience to date and discussions on&#13;
the development of future projects.&#13;
E. Procurement "&#13;
5.12         Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.3. Civil works&#13;
contracts, to be financed by the Government, would be mainly for the refurbishment of&#13;
facilities and would be procured under NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Equipment&#13;
" The Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995 and&#13;
revised in January 1996 will apply to all goods procured under this Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
would be grouped, to the greatest extent possible, in packages of US$200,000 or more&#13;
(estimated value US$31.5 million) for procurement under ICB utilizing standard bidding&#13;
documents issued by the Bank. Equipment packages in contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000 may be procured up to an aggregate limit of US$3.7 million through NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank or, for contracts below US$50,000 through national&#13;
shopping 12 procedures (aggregate limit US$1.8 million). Local equipment manufacturers&#13;
would be extended a margin of preference of 15% of the CIF price, or the prevailing customs&#13;
duties, whichever is the lower, on bid evaluation under ICB. Instructional materials' 3&#13;
(aggregate amount US$3.7 million) would be procured on the basis of direct purchase after&#13;
negotiating for discounts with publishers or their authorized distributors.  Candidates for&#13;
(overseas trainintg would be selected in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The prior review threshold for equipment contracts financed by the Bank, is US$7.5&#13;
million, in line with the regional guidelines for Thailand. No equipment contract is expected&#13;
to exceed the threshold amount, however the first three contracts of each year of project&#13;
implementation would be reviewed by the Bank. All remaining contracts would be subject to&#13;
post review. Supervision missions would conduct all post reviews. It is planned that about&#13;
25% of all ICB contracts would be post reviewed.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
5.13        The proposed Bank loan of US$31.6 million would be disbursed on the basis&#13;
of:&#13;
(1) Equipment           US$29.6    100% of foreign expenditures;&#13;
100% of local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost); 65% of local&#13;
expenditures for other&#13;
equipment items procured&#13;
locally.&#13;
(2) Overseas Training    US$1.1      90% of total expenditures.&#13;
(3) Instructional Materials  US$0.9  50% of foreign expenditures.&#13;
5.14        Disbursements in respect to contracts for equipment estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$7.5 million equivalent and for expenditures on overseas training and instructional&#13;
materials, would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE) certified by the Ministry&#13;
of Education. Documentation would be retained by MOE and available for review by the&#13;
Bank during supervision missions. Administrative and accounting capability in MOE is&#13;
adequate to support the SOE procedure. Full documentation would be required by the Bank&#13;
for any contract above US$7.5 million equivalent. To the extent practicable, withdrawal&#13;
applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$200,000 or more prior to submission to&#13;
the Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the loan. In view of the satisfactory&#13;
budgetary procedures and financing of Bank-assisted projects in Thailand, it was agreed to&#13;
accept the Government's preference not to establish a special account. The proposed Bank&#13;
loan would be disbursed over a period of 5.5 years (Annex 12) which is one year less than the&#13;
standard disbursement profile for Thailand (all sectors). The shorter period is justified by&#13;
the strong management and implementation capacity built into the project and the&#13;
Government's commitment to complete the project in five years. The completion date of the&#13;
project would be October 31, 2001 and the closing date April 30, 2002.&#13;
G. Accounts, Audits and Reporting&#13;
5.15        The Government would cause the project institutions to maintain project&#13;
accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices:  During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that audited accounts would be sent to the Bank within six&#13;
months of the end of the financial year. Audit reports would include a separate opinion for&#13;
expenditures under SOE procedures. The Government would also cause each project&#13;
institution to submit an annual progress report to the Bank and to provide implementation&#13;
status reports for visiting missions. Within six months of the closing date, an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report would be prepared jointly by the Bank and Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
H. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.16         The project would have no adverse impact on the environment. It would help&#13;
to improve the quality of training in skills that would directly impact on the implementation,&#13;
maintenance, and operation of environmental works and projects. For example, project&#13;
institutions would train skilled workers and technicians in the areas of: electronics; controls;&#13;
chemical processing; civil works; petroleum processing; and equipment maintenance. Many&#13;
of these skilled workers and technicians would seek employment in water and sewage&#13;
treatment plants, power generation plants, road construction, mining, etc.&#13;
I. Project Sustainability&#13;
5.17        The Government clearly recognizes the vital role of the VTE system in&#13;
producing the skilled manpower necessary to sustain the country's industrial growth. Raising&#13;
the quality of VTE so that the system can keep pace with rapid technological change is a high&#13;
priority. The RIT is a key part of the system and thus it is likely that the investments&#13;
included under the project will be implemented successfully and sustained in the longer term.&#13;
Furthermore, the Government has sought Bank assistance on its own initiative because it&#13;
values the Bank's ability to produce projects which are soundly designed and properly&#13;
focused on sectoral needs. This reinforces the view that the project would be efficiently&#13;
implemented and its benefits sustained in the longer term. As noted previously (paras. 3.14-&#13;
3.15), the present education policy framework is adequate for the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project, although there are important longer-term policy problems to be addressed.&#13;
However, these problems would not adversely affect sustainability of the proposed project.&#13;
They will be addressed in a sector study and recommendations for their resolution will be&#13;
implemented in conjunction with future projects. Prospects for the sustainability of project&#13;
outcomes have been further reinforced by the high priority being given to education&#13;
development in the Eighth Plan.&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.1          The project would assist in upgrading the training of skilled workers and&#13;
technicians, thus increasing their employability and raising productivity in the workforce.&#13;
Under the project, better-trained instructors, improved curricula and up-to-date equipment&#13;
would help to ensure that skilled workers and technicians would be better able to cope with&#13;
rapidly changing technology in industry. In the longer term, the project would contribute to&#13;
strengthening Thailand's capacity to pursue more technology-intensive industrialization.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2          The main risk associated with the project concerns the capacity of MOE/RIT&#13;
to implement the project. Although some staff remain in MOE who have had experience&#13;
under previous projects, this is now out of date. Thus special attention will be given to&#13;
staffing the PIU and to overall coordination through the PCU. Project risks would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
alleviated by the employment of project management and procurement advisers, through the&#13;
allocation of additional resources to project supervision in the early years of implementation&#13;
and by means of the annual reviews of implementation.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1         During negotiations the Government agreed:&#13;
(a)  to the terms of reference for the education sector policy study&#13;
(para. 3.15);&#13;
(b)  to prepare an education sector strategy for review in conjunction&#13;
with the Bank by March 15, 1997 and to review progress in the&#13;
implementation of the strategy with the Bank by March 15, 1999 (para.&#13;
3.16);&#13;
(c)  to implement eleven institutional plans to refurbish physical facilities in&#13;
project that were approved by the RIT President on June 15, 1995 and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank (para. 4.12);&#13;
(d)  that in conjunction with the Bank, the Govermnent would undertake&#13;
an annual review of project progress based on agreed monitorable&#13;
indicators which had been integrated into the overall monitoring system&#13;
(para.5. 11);&#13;
(e)  that the third annual review would include an overall assessment of&#13;
implementation experience to date and also include discussions on the&#13;
development of future projects (para. 5.11);&#13;
(f)  that audited accounts of the project, including a separate opinion for&#13;
expenditures under SOE procedures, would be sent to the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of each financial year (para. 5.15); and&#13;
(g)  that implementation status reports would be prepared for presentation to&#13;
visiting Bank supervision missions (para. 5.15);&#13;
7.2         The condition of loan effectiveness is that the PCU and the PIU would be&#13;
established and staffed with key personnel (para. 5.8).&#13;
7.3         Subject to the above conditions, the project constitutes a suitable basis for a&#13;
fixed rate US dollar single currency Bank loan of US$31.6 million equivalent to Thailand for&#13;
a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace.&#13;

Administration and Organization. The RIT operates as a Department of&#13;
the Ministry of Education. The head of the Institute is the President (See Chart 1 for&#13;
organization chart). He reports to the Permanent Secretary of MOE. The President receives&#13;
advisory input from the RIT Council comprised of representatives from the Institute and the&#13;
private sector. At present, the RIT has about 7,500 permanent staff (Table 4) employed on&#13;
its 31 campuses (12 urban and 19 regional). The total number of enrollments in 1994 was&#13;
about 72,000 students (Tables I and 2).&#13;
Financing. The RIT is financed by the Government and student fees. At&#13;
present the budget for the RIT is about B2,278 million or about 2.1% of the MOE budget&#13;
(Table 2.2). Students generally pay fees ranging from B50 to B150 per credit hour. Most&#13;
students take about 24 credit hours per semester. Depending upon their enrolled program,&#13;
students pay between 10% and 20% of the unit costs for their programs. In addition, a&#13;
limited number of programs are offered to industry in production work which is financed&#13;
through cost recovery. Some programs also require that students provide the cost of some&#13;
instructional supplies/materials. It is estimated that since 1990, about 17% of the total RIT&#13;
budget has come from sources outside the Government budget. Unit costs per year for RIT&#13;
range widely for technical programs. It is estimated that the costs for certificate and diploma&#13;
students vary from about B9,000 to B15,000 per year and for engineering degree programs,&#13;
B41,000 to B65,000 (Table 3).&#13;
Foreign Assistance Inputs. Since 1988, the RIT has received aid from&#13;
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Austria, United States&#13;
of America, and Belgium. Most of the assistance has been targeted on a few instructional&#13;
areas and has been in the form of training (local and foreign) and visiting teachers/consultants&#13;
to support the improvement of teaching methods and curricula. Some projects have provided&#13;
small amounts of equipment as a component of their agreement. More recently Austria has&#13;
provided additional equipment and technical assistance.&#13;

Instructional Programs&#13;
The instructional programs are divided into two main streams, degree&#13;
programs and non-degree programs. Each academic stream is served by a separate teacher&#13;
corps and is administered under separate units within the RIT.&#13;
Degree-level Programs. The Institute has 11 academic faculties which offer&#13;
about 41 degree programs on 21 campuses. These faculties include: (a) Agriculture at&#13;
Bangphra; (b) Agriculture at Nakhon Si Thammarat; (c) Agriculture Engineering and&#13;
Technology; (d) Business Administration; (e) Drama and Music; (f) Education; (g)&#13;
Engineering Technology; (h) Fine Arts; (i) Home Economics; (j) Liberal Arts and (k)&#13;
Science and Fishery Technology. In 1994, 14,261 students were enrolled in degree programs&#13;
at RIT .&#13;
The faculties are responsible for the provision of academic services to support&#13;
two curriculum groups of undergraduate programs. The first group offers technical B.S.&#13;
degrees in the areas of agriculture, home economics, business administration, engineering and&#13;
fine arts. The second curriculum group offers vocational and technical teacher education&#13;
B.S. degrees for teachers of agriculture, home economics, drama and music, business&#13;
administration, engineering (trade and industrial) education, and fine arts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Non-degree Level (Certificate and Diploma) Programs. As mentioned&#13;
above, a separate teaching force offers certificate and diploma courses. They are in varying&#13;
combinations and total about 91 programs.  They are offered on a total of about 30&#13;
campuses.&#13;
The instructional programs at the certificate level are provided on about 21 of&#13;
RIT's campuses though out Thailand. These campuses offer about 34 courses in the areas of&#13;
technical (23), agricultural (1), business administration (5), home economics (4), and fine arts&#13;
(1). In 1994, 19,395 students were enrolled in certificate programs at RIT.&#13;
The diploma courses are offered in about 28 campuses. They include about&#13;
108 subjects in the areas of technical (60), agriculture (10), business administration (11),&#13;
home economics (7), fine arts (20) and drama and music (1). In 1994, 38,441 students were&#13;
enrolled in diploma programs at RIT.&#13;
Internal Efficiency&#13;
Management Capacity. The RIT is a large and complicated technical&#13;
training organization. With more than 70,000 enrollments and a wide variety of programs, it&#13;
must be considered a large college by most standards of comparison. The management of&#13;
RIT is well structured and fully capable of managing the diverse operations of the Institute.&#13;
Its organizational structure is well conceived and conservative given the large number of&#13;
campuses that must be administered and coordinated (Chart 1). The central and local&#13;
administrators are generally well experienced and most have had many years of tenure with&#13;
RIT. As most of the training and experience of RIT administrators is from local sources,&#13;
there is a need for them to have more international exposure to the administrative policies&#13;
and procedures of other countries with large institutions and similar programs. Of the&#13;
employed staff (totaling about 7,550), less than 10% are classified as administrative officers.&#13;
Student Flows. Although difficult to analyze, due to the complexity of the&#13;
programs and enrollment procedures, a review of the available data suggests that the student&#13;
flows are reasonably efficient overall. Typically, the campuses are able to maximize their&#13;
enrollments every semester. Student dropouts are generally low and there are few students&#13;
recycled in the programs.&#13;
Teachers. The teachers' academic qualifications are reasonable, but on the&#13;
low side, for the types of programs offered by the Institute. About 67% of the teachers have&#13;
B.S. degrees and 28% have masters degrees. About 1% of the teachers have doctorates and&#13;
4% have less than B.S. degrees. Most have limited or no industrial experience in the areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
for which they were trained and are teaching. This is a significant shortcoming in RIT. Over&#13;
the years, through inservice training and preservice education, many teachers have been&#13;
trained in pedagogy including instructional methods, curriculum development and&#13;
instructional materials development. To further support this effort to upgrade the teaching&#13;
force, the RIT has an active program whereby foreign teachers are invited to teach and&#13;
conduct research at the Institute and to share their expertise with local counterparts. During&#13;
the past five years, the Institute has typically had from 20 to 30 teachers/researchers in&#13;
residence each year. Likewise, there is a significant effort to send a limited number of&#13;
teachers on short-term and long-term fellowship programs in a number of countries.&#13;
Typically about 15 long-term fellowships (local and foreign) are made available for selected&#13;
staff each year. About 30 short term scholarships (local and foreign) are also made available&#13;
each year.&#13;
Most of the teachers of technical subjects need upgrading to enable them to&#13;
teach the emerging technologies in their respective subject areas. They also need to have&#13;
more opportunities to acquire industrial experience and to upgrade their academic&#13;
credentials. The overall student/teacher ratios range from 15 to I to about 20 to 1.&#13;

Facilities and Equipment. As mentioned above the RIT has 31 teaching&#13;
institutions and 5 research and training centers. Overall, the facilities vary in their adequacy,&#13;
but many are in need of major upgrading and refurbishing. Over the years, inadequate&#13;
attention and funding has been given to the maintenance of the buildings. As the result, many&#13;
need refurbishing. In particular, there is a need to upgrade the laboratories and workshops&#13;
that support the higher level technologies required by industry.&#13;
The types of equipment in the RIT are reasonably well balanced for the&#13;
programs being offered. There are significant amounts of medium to high technology&#13;
equipment installed in the various campuses. Much of the medium technology equipment is&#13;
obsolete and suffers from years of hard use by students and less than adequate maintenance.&#13;
This severely limits the quality and level of instructional programs offered by the Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Although quite insufficient in quantity, the higher technology equipment is&#13;
generally up-to-date and well maintained. Maintenance in the institutions is considered&#13;
important, but faces limitations of inadequate budget allocations and a lack of staff capacity.&#13;
There is a significant need to upgrade the equipment in RIT and to establish a more viable&#13;
approach to equipment operations management and maintenance. Of particular need is the&#13;
introduction of training equipment to support emerging higher technology training.&#13;
Curriculum and Instructional Materials Development. All curricula used&#13;
by RIT are centrally developed and approved by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry&#13;
of University Affairs. The process is formalized and relatively slow. The process begins with&#13;
the RIT's Curriculum Board (chaired by the President) which sets policy and approvals for&#13;
curriculum reform and new curricula. Following that, curriculum committees for each field&#13;
are established. The curriculum committees have participation from industry and access to&#13;
labor market information. These committees manage the curriculum development processes.&#13;
They decide on the specific activities that need to take place and then appoint working&#13;
committees of senior teachers from the various college campuses. These teachers research&#13;
and write the necessary documents required.  Following the completion of the draft&#13;
curriculum, the documents are sent to the Curriculum Board for review and approval.&#13;
Following the approval, the curriculum is then sent to the RIT Council for approval.&#13;
Following the approval by the RIT Council, the curriculum is then sent to the Ministry of&#13;
University Affairs and the Ministry of Education. Following that, it is printed and distributed.&#13;
Existing curricula are evaluated every three years. Minor modifications are&#13;
often made every year as required. New curricula are evaluated on a yearly basis until all&#13;
problems are worked out. It is estimated that in 1994, about B1.9 million was allocated to&#13;
support curriculum development for the RIT.&#13;
The development of instructional media and materials is done through an&#13;
Instructional Materials Development Center that is attached to the RIT Registrar's Office.&#13;
These materials generally support the core courses and new curricula that are formally&#13;
introduced. Additional audio-visual and written instructional materials are produced by the&#13;
instructors within their own institutions. Most institutions have the capacity to produce&#13;
commonly used instructional materials. The MOE offers a course on the development of&#13;
instructional materials that all instructional staff are encouraged to take. Over the next five&#13;
years there will be a need to upgrade curricula and develop more instructional materials for&#13;
the higher-level technologies being introduced by the Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
Instructional Methodology. The RIT actively encourages the use of modem&#13;
instructional methods including audio-visual technology, demonstration approaches with&#13;
video camera, mock-ups, etc. Considerable effort is made to train teachers who need to use&#13;
these approaches in their instructional programs. There is a need for more teacher training in&#13;
the use of methodology that features higher levels of&#13;
technology (e.g., computer based modeling, computer or digital-based simulators, and&#13;
interactive learning). There is an inadequate amount of related equipment to support the&#13;
teaching process.&#13;
External Efficiency.&#13;
Placement rates for the RIT are high, although variable. It is estimated that&#13;
the rates range from about 80% to about 95%. Such high rates should be expected as the&#13;
economy is rapidly expanding and there is a high demand from the private sector for&#13;
personnel with the training that is received at RIT. In 1995, it is expected that the RIT will&#13;
graduate about 6,000 persons from certificate programs 15,000 with diplomas and about&#13;
4,000 with degrees.&#13;
Employer satisfaction is considered high for RIT graduates. The RIT has&#13;
determined this through an ongoing follow-up program where students and employers are&#13;
asked to provide the evaluation of the programs offered by the RIT. Every year a 60%&#13;
sample (random) of graduates are selected for participation in the study. Of that sample&#13;
about 40% receive mailed questionnaires. The remaining 60% are interviewed by RIT&#13;
personnel along with their employers. Of the mailed survey, there is typically a 50% return.&#13;
The collected data is analyzed and the findings are given to the President for review and&#13;
consideration. A report also goes to the Curriculum Board as input to future modifications&#13;
of curricula and instructional materials.&#13;

            The overall objective of the Technical
            Education Project is to improve the quality of technical
            education programs in 11 selected Rajamangala Institute of
            Technology (RIT) campuses. Specifically, the project aims
            to: 1) improve the management capacity within the RITs; 2)
            strengthen curricula and linkages with industry; 3) upgrade
            workshops and laboratories through the provision of
            up-to-date equipment and physical improvements to buildings;
            4) expand the supply and upgrade the quality of
            instructional materials; and 5) strengthen the practical
            skills of key teaching staff in advanced technologies
            through overseas training. The project will consist of the
            following components: 1) institutional improvement; 2)
            equipment; 3) curriculum development; 4) instructional
            materials; 5) operations and maintenance; and 6) civil works
            for the refurbishment of facilities.
