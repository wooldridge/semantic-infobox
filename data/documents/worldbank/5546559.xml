MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ&#13;
EMERGENCY HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
Country Background&#13;
1.    Abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a middle-&#13;
income country in the 1970s. The country developed good infrastructure and well-performing&#13;
healthcare and education systems, widely regarded as the best in the Middle East. Income per&#13;
capita rose to over US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Since that time, successive wars and a&#13;
repressive, state-dominated economic system have stifled growth and development and&#13;
debilitated basic infrastructure and social services. International trade sanctions imposed in 1991&#13;
took a toll on the economy. Despite the country's rich resource endowment, Iraq's human&#13;
development indicators are now among the lowest in the region and income per capita dropped&#13;
to about US$770 by 2001, with continued decline thereafter. Although there is a paucity of&#13;
reliable economic data, 2003 GDP is estimated at about US$12.1 billion, or about US$446 per&#13;
person, assuming a population of about 27.1 million.&#13;
Current Challenges and International Response&#13;
2.    Following the recent war, Iraq faces enormous challenges and the situation is still&#13;
evolving. In addition to a complicated political transition, Iraq needs to rebuild social cohesion&#13;
and implement an economic transition from a centrally planned economy to a diversified market&#13;
economy. It will be particularly important to mitigate the temporary adverse effect of reforms on&#13;
the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
3.    A Needs Assessment covering fourteen sectors, prepared jointly in 2003 by the World&#13;
Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG), and with the participation of the&#13;
International Monetary Fund, estimated that Iraq requires about US$36.0 billion for&#13;
reconstruction over four years, and the then Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) estimated&#13;
separately that Iraq requires about US$19.0 billion over four years for security and oil&#13;
production, areas otherwise not covered by the Needs Assessment.&#13;
4.    At an International Donors' Conference for Iraq in Madrid on October 23-24, 2003,&#13;
donors expressed support for the Needs Assessment and pledged about US$32.0 billion for the&#13;
four-year period covered by the Needs Assessment. Donors also asked the World Bank and&#13;
UNDG to set up an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) to ensure swift,&#13;
flexible, and coordinated donor financing for priority investments consistent with the Needs&#13;
Assessment. IRFFI consists of two trust funds-a World Bank Iraq Trust Fund and a UNDG&#13;
Trust Fund-each with its own internal governance procedures and a management structure that&#13;
ensures close coordination. Information on current and planned international donor health&#13;
activities in Iraq can be found in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Health Sector&#13;
5.    Once considered one of the best in the region, the Iraqi health system has suffered the&#13;
consequences of three major wars, inappropriate policies, poor management and the absence of&#13;
adequate resource allocation. During the 1980s, Iraq's health sector consisted of a highly&#13;
advanced curative system, with little, if any, public health approaches in place. During the&#13;
1990s, funds available for health were reduced by 90% and health outcomes became among the&#13;
poorest in the region and well below levels found in countries of comparable income. According&#13;
to the 2003 UNICEF/WHO Health and Nutrition Watching Brief, Iraq has the region's second-&#13;
highest infant mortality (83/1,000 live births in 2002) and under-five mortality rates (117/1,000&#13;
in 2001), a stark reversal from the improvements in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During the&#13;
1990s, maternal mortality grew close to three-fold, with an estimated 30% of women giving birth&#13;
without a qualified health worker in attendance.&#13;
6.    Prior to 1990, Iraq was entering its epidemiological transition from infectious to non-&#13;
communicable diseases, but has since been suffering from a double burden in its disease profile.&#13;
Iraq is experiencing increases in non-communicable disease morbidity and mortality, while at the&#13;
same time facing increases in the incidence of communicable diseases. The Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOH) has identified the following as contributing factors to the deteriorating health status: poor&#13;
investment in the health sector, poorly maintained health infrastructure, inappropriate&#13;
management of the health sector, poor sanitation and water supply, unsafe food storage, and&#13;
unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors.&#13;
7.    Currently, the Iraqi health system is suffering from institutional inefficiencies due to&#13;
inadequate resource allocation (financial and workforce) and poor management. The health&#13;
system's physical infrastructure suffers from severe deterioration due to neglect over time and&#13;
consequences from last year's war and looting, whereby most of the health infrastructure remains&#13;
in poor condition and is critically lacking essential equipment.&#13;
8.    The Iraq Health Sector Situation and Strategy Options Assessment' reports that less than&#13;
one-third of Iraq's hospitals and health centers have adequate facilities to provide emergency&#13;
obstetric care. For example, it is estimated that 65% of births occur outside of health facilities,&#13;
and the proportion of deliveries without trained assistance has increased since the 1990s to 30%&#13;
in urban areas and 40% in rural areas at the present time. Approximately 15-20% of deliveries&#13;
classify as high-risk and require emergency obstetric support. Given these obstacles, the&#13;
maternal mortality ratio in Iraq is extremely high and is estimated to be 300 per 100,000 live&#13;
births. The needs are urgent for improved emergency obstetric care, given the bleak maternal&#13;
mortality indicators. It is therefore imperative to upgrade key facilities with the essential&#13;
emergency equipment, drugs, training and referral capacity to provide adequate emergency&#13;
obstetric care to the population.&#13;
9.    The 2003 UN/WB Joint Iraq Needs Assessment identified US$1.6 billion of needs for the&#13;
health sector in the next four years, focusing on: (i) restoration of effective control and&#13;
l Drafted in October 2003 by the Ministry of Health, the Coalition Provisional Authority, the UN Development&#13;
Group and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
implementation for public health programs; (ii) equitable access and focus on women, children&#13;
and other vulnerable groups; (iii) rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and provision of&#13;
equipment; (iv) resolution of imbalances in the distribution and skill-mix of health professionals;&#13;
and (v) initiation of a national health plan. More recently, the Ministry of Health has calculated&#13;
estimates for basic rehabilitation of the health sector to be at least US$4.0 billion over the next&#13;
four years.&#13;
10.   In a recent meeting in July 2004 between the senior staff of the Ministry of Health and&#13;
the donor community (World Bank, UN agencies, and some bilaterals), the following overall&#13;
priority areas were identified by the Ministry: (i) pharmaceuticals, vaccines and medical&#13;
equipment; (ii) emergency medical services; (iii) essential infrastructure rehabilitation; (iv)&#13;
health information system; (v) communicable disease control and surveillance; (vi)&#13;
communication equipment (hardware); (vii) capacity building and human resources&#13;
development; (viii) communication and health promotion strategy for the health sector; (ix)&#13;
health management; (x) primary health care; (xi) food safety; and (xii) donor coordination.&#13;
11.   In view of the health situation in Iraq, where infant and maternal mortality rates are&#13;
extremely high and conflict-related injuries are very common, and taking into account the&#13;
priority areas identified by the MOH and the donor community, this Project will meet several of&#13;
the urgent needs listed above in response to the current post-conflict situation. Of the twelve&#13;
aforementioned priority areas, this Project is designed to address five in a manner involving&#13;
technical soundness, quick implementation, proper procurement and financial management: (i)&#13;
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment; (ii) emergency medical services; (iii) essential&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation; (iv) capacity building and human resources development; and (v)&#13;
health management.&#13;
Existing Health Infrastructure&#13;
12.   Existing Hospitals. There are more than 240 hospitals in Iraq. Of these, 172 are&#13;
government-owned and operated, of which approximately 12% were partially damaged and/or&#13;
looted in 2003. It is widely known that most hospitals have suffered from neglect over the last&#13;
two decades, exacerbated by the aftermath of the 2003 war. There has been a systematic lack of&#13;
maintenance of the physical infrastructure, essential drugs and equipment, and looting has&#13;
worsened the conditions in most facilities. In particular, emergency medical services at Iraqi&#13;
hospitals are in a severely inadequate state, where emergency and critical care principles are&#13;
lacking, and in many cases, even aseptic management is clearly absent. Shortages of essential&#13;
and emergency medicines have been recurrent within the Iraqi hospital system.&#13;
13.   Primary Health Care Facilities. From a total of 1,285 primary health care centers&#13;
(PHCs), at least two-thirds require essential rehabilitation, including access to safe water,&#13;
electricity, sanitation and medical waste treatment facilities. Over the last two decades, the&#13;
MOH has not been able to maintain its facilities adequately and, as a result, they have become&#13;
dilapidated and dysfunctional. Due to lack of maintenance or loss to post-war looting, absence&#13;
of existing or functional equipment is widely reported. More than 80% of health centers lack&#13;
such basic items as stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, sterilizers and weighing scales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
14.   While significant donor commitments have been made towards the construction of new&#13;
health facilities, no significant commitments have been made to rehabilitate the existing health&#13;
facilities. Funding from the US Program Management Office (PMO) is planned for a limited&#13;
number of new health centers (150), but the MOH notes severe delays in its implementation and&#13;
the number of centers expected to be constructed is not sufficient to meet the current needs.&#13;
PMO funding is also planned for a new maternity hospital and a new pediatric hospital. The&#13;
MOH has identified the rehabilitation of selected key hospitals, and primary health care&#13;
facilities, particularly in rural areas, as an urgent and priority need that would help to improve the&#13;
quality of and access to basic health services in the shortest period of time.&#13;
Existing Human Resource Capacity&#13;
15.   The MOH capacity to formulate and implement policies, and manage the provision of&#13;
basic services remains very weak. Empowerment of the Iraqi health system requires more than&#13;
political will, and skills must be strengthened. Substantial investments are urgently needed to&#13;
build up a sufficient capacity at the central, Governorate, and district levels. Such training&#13;
activities include health planning, national health accounts, health policy and health care&#13;
financing, project management, financial management and procurement (including&#13;
pharmaceutical procurement).&#13;
16.   The establishment of an adequate level of managerial capacity has been recognized as&#13;
critical. Some donors have begun work on such areas as clinical training (WHO and JICA), but&#13;
the need to strengthen the management capacity at both the central and Govemorate levels and&#13;
support public health training remains largely unmet. Iraq currently has very few, if any,&#13;
qualified public health specialists and no system is in place to train health staff in this area.&#13;
B.    BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
17.   In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an Interim&#13;
Strategy Note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act as administrator&#13;
of the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund.&#13;
18.   The World Bank Group's interim strategy, which initially covered the period February-&#13;
October 2004 is still in effect, and the Bank's work remains within the framework of the&#13;
strategy. The strategy focuses on: (i) building Iraqi capacity which is urgently needed for the&#13;
reconstruction program; (ii) preparing and implementing emergency operations to generate&#13;
employment and restore essential infrastructure and services; and (iii) laying the foundation for&#13;
the medium-term program, through studies and policy advice.&#13;
19.   The strategy relies on the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance projects, and on&#13;
Bank budget for the economic and sector work and policy advice that is needed. The ITF has&#13;
about US$370 million to cover nine projects. One project has been completed, three are under&#13;
way, and five are in the final stages of preparation. The interim strategy also includes building&#13;
blocks of analytical work to support the transition to a diversified market economy and the&#13;
development of a social protection system. Analytical work has been grouped into three clusters:&#13;
economic reform and transition, public sector management, and poverty and safety nets; and two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
sectors: health and education. A multi-sectoral institutional capacity building program has&#13;
already commenced.&#13;
20.   The proposed Project aims to address the most urgent needs of the health sector,&#13;
stemming from years of neglect, the recent conflict, and dramatic increases in violence in areas&#13;
that had until recently been relatively untouched. Expected to be implemented within 24 months&#13;
after Project Effectiveness, the Project will be used to establish a model for planning,&#13;
procurement and financial management within the health sector. It will also allow for the&#13;
development of a standardized approach to rehabilitation of health facilities and will constitute&#13;
the most effective way for the MOH to acquire the capacity it needs to manage longer-term&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.&#13;
21.   Discussions have been held between the Bank and the Iraqi authorities concerning future&#13;
support to the health sector, possibly in the form of a three to four year investment project that&#13;
would follow the initial Grant. In planning the follow-on investment, the MOH will focus on&#13;
longer-term needs for the sector and will prepare a more comprehensive project. Possible areas&#13;
identified include: (i) support for the repair and rehabilitation of Primary Health Centers,&#13;
including provision of basic medical equipment and supplies; (ii) continued support for the&#13;
repair, rehabilitation and equipping of priority hospital services, such as Emergency Units and&#13;
Emergency Obstetric Services, building on the results of the first Project; (iii) continued&#13;
capacity-building and training for MOH staff, (iv) with the involvement of other donors, support&#13;
to the creation of a School of Public Health, responding to the needs of the country but with the&#13;
potential to become a regional training institution; (v) assistance in reform of the pharnaceutical&#13;
sector; and (vi) assistance in the design of health policies and health systems reformns. This&#13;
follow-on investment would be further elaborated at a later date, based on emerging priorities&#13;
and the results of the initial Project.&#13;
22.    Given the situation in the health sector, the Minister of Health has approached the World&#13;
Bank to request assistance in addressing the most urgent rehabilitation needs to strengthen the&#13;
Iraqi health system and increase its capacity to alleviate the currently soaring infant and maternal&#13;
mortality rates. Areas of priority would include:&#13;
* Hospital rehabilitation, particularly Emergency Services capabilities and provision of&#13;
essential emergency equipment and pharmaceuticals&#13;
* Capacity-building and training of MOH staff&#13;
23.   Building on the stated priorities of the MOH, the Bank can play an important role in&#13;
supporting the rehabilitation of the health sector in Iraq, based on the Bank's comparative&#13;
advantages, including: (i) applicable experiences from relevant development and post-conflict&#13;
situations, in particular within the past decade; (ii) "best practice" models that can be applied to&#13;
the current context; (iii) in-depth knowledge and expertise in health systems development; (iv)&#13;
extensive experience in helping Governments to work effectively with NGOs; and (v) in its role&#13;
as financier of last resort, the ability to mobilize additional financing to address the most critical&#13;
needs for basic health service delivery throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
24.   Lessons from Post-Conflict Experience. Based on the World Bank's recent experience in&#13;
post-conflict countries such as Afghanistan, East Timor, Bosnia, Algeria, Sierra Leone and&#13;
Kosovo, a number of important lessons have been learned and introduced into the design of the&#13;
proposed project. Below are key lessons learned:&#13;
* For emergency recovery projects, a simple project design that can be quickly and&#13;
visibly implemented is most effective.&#13;
*  The project should be part of a programmatic framework based on needs assessment&#13;
of the sector and close collaboration with other key donors.&#13;
*  Support to emergency priorities should be coupled with capacity building for the&#13;
implementing institutions and entities in order to improve their ability to implement&#13;
current and consecutive programs.&#13;
* In contexts where direct Bank supervision is not possible, adequate training should be&#13;
provided to local representatives to carry out oversight of the project activities.&#13;
*  In post-conflict situations where there are numerous donor agencies involved, support&#13;
should be provided to the MOH in establishing an effective coordinating mechanism.&#13;
This support could be in the form of technical assistance and training in setting up the&#13;
mechanism within the framework of the project, as well as through "informal"&#13;
technical advice from the Bank team itself to the relevant MOH counterparts. In&#13;
addition, the Bank needs to maintain good and frequent collaboration with&#13;
development partners.&#13;
C.    DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
25.   The principal objective of the Project is to improve access to quality emergency services&#13;
in selected health facilities to serve the urgent needs of the Iraqi population. This objective&#13;
would be achieved through: (i) rehabilitation of priority emergency services, including&#13;
emergency obstetric care in 12 selected hospitals, and the urgent provision of basic medical and&#13;
laboratory equipment to the selected rehabilitated hospitals; (ii) the provision of a 3 to 6 month&#13;
supply of up to 37 essential emergency drugs to be used at emergency facilities rehabilitated&#13;
through this project; (iii) continued support to strengthening of planning and management&#13;
capacity within the central and Governorate health administrations; and (iv) support to project&#13;
management. By the end of this project, it is expected that:&#13;
* Twelve carefully selected hospitals will have functioning emergency medical services&#13;
defined by adequate physical infrastructure, essential equipment and drugs, adequate&#13;
staffing and well-trained emergency teams.&#13;
* The Ministry of Health will have strengthened its planning and management capacity at&#13;
both central and Governorate levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Project Description&#13;
26.   The Project will comprise four components, to be implemented over a period of up to 24&#13;
months. It will be fully funded as a Grant under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, operating&#13;
under OP 8.50, Emergency Recovery Assistance. The four components are described below:&#13;
Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services (estimated total cost US$21.4&#13;
million)&#13;
27.   The Project will support the repair, rehabilitation and equipping activities of hospital&#13;
emergency facilities to restore fully functional emergency services in 12 carefully selected&#13;
hospitals in 9 Govemorates of Iraq. These activities have been identified and prioritized using&#13;
explicit criteria of need, feasibility and affordability (see Annex 8A). Repairs and rehabilitation&#13;
will focus on the priority structural, electrical, mechanical and heating/air conditioning systems&#13;
for: (a) emergency room reception and administrative counter; (b) triage areas; (c) diagnostic&#13;
services rooms; (d) patient examination areas; (e) patient wards; (f) minor surgery operating&#13;
theatre; (g) doctors' and nurses' offices and rest areas; (h) nurses' station; (i) emergency drug&#13;
dispensary; and (.) other support areas (sterilization room, kitchen, restrooms, storage, janitorial&#13;
space).&#13;
28.   The Project will also provide the selected facilities with their most urgent needs in&#13;
diagnostic and therapeutic equipment for emergency services, including specific emergency&#13;
room equipment. Examples of such equipment selected are: diagnostic equipment, emergency&#13;
resuscitation equipment, and emergency life support equipment (see Annex 8B for a complete&#13;
list of specific planned investments).&#13;
29.   This first phase of the reconstruction effort will concentrate on establishment of a&#13;
sustainable model for planning, procurement and financial management. It will allow for the&#13;
development of a standardized approach to the rehabilitation of health facilities and will&#13;
constitute the most effective way for the MOH to acquire the capacity it needs to manage longer-&#13;
term  reconstruction/rehabilitation activities.  The Project will provide financing for the&#13;
rehabilitation activities, emergency medical equipment and technical assistance for design and&#13;
supervision of the sites.&#13;
Component 2: Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs (estimated total cost US$2.9 million)&#13;
30.   The Project will support the procurement and distribution of a 3 to 6 month supply of up&#13;
to 37 essential emergency drugs to be used at the 12 emergency facilities rehabilitated under&#13;
Component 1. Categories of essential emergency drugs include the following: (i) general&#13;
anesthetics; (ii) preoperative medication and sedatives; (iii) anti-infective drugs; (iv)&#13;
cardiovascular drugs; and (v) oral and parenteral solutions. This component will be supported&#13;
through the provision of pharmaceuticals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Component 3: Capacity Building and Training (estimated total cost US$1.7 million)&#13;
31.   The Project will support capacity-building and training activities in Emergency Medical&#13;
Services for the 12 selected sites. These activities will include: (i) technical training of&#13;
emergency 5-person teams from each selected site to improve the quality of emergency services;&#13;
(ii) training in management of emergency services for the hospital directors, emergency chief&#13;
doctors, head nurses and central-level emergency services planners; and (iii) the development of&#13;
a comprehensive national plan for strengthening emergency health care services. Additionally,&#13;
the Project will support training to build the general capacity of MOH in health planning and&#13;
management at both the central and Govemorate levels. A number of short-term training&#13;
programs will allow for the constitution of a core group of public health and health management&#13;
specialists. The project will also provide assistance to the MOH in developing a sustainable plan&#13;
for procurement and distribution of essential emergency drugs. This component will be&#13;
supported through the provision of technical assistance and training activities.&#13;
Component 4: Project Management (estimated total cost US$ 0.9 million)&#13;
32.   The objective of this component is to ensure effective administration and coordination of&#13;
the project activities. The Project Management Team (PMT) will comprise 11 staff, five of&#13;
whom will be local consultants hired under the Project. PMT staff will include: a Project&#13;
Director to manage and coordinate the implementation of the Project; a Deputy Project Director&#13;
to be responsible for day-to-day management of the project; a Technical Coordinator to ensure&#13;
that the technical aspects of the project are being implemented; a Procurement Officer, assisted&#13;
by three staff, to supervise tendering, purchasing and delivery of works, goods and services; a&#13;
Financial Officer, assisted by an accountant, to maintain project financial records; an&#13;
Administrative Secretary, and a Junior Secretary to support the needs of the office. Drivers for&#13;
the three project vehicles and a messenger will also be hired to support the project.&#13;
33.   The component will finance: (i) minor refurbishment of the PMT offices agreed between&#13;
the MOH and the Bank; (ii) adequate office equipment and supplies, and three project vehicles;&#13;
(iii) technical assistance and training for PMT staff in project management, procurement and&#13;
financial management; (iv) annual external audit of the project; and (v) operating costs for the&#13;
PMT, including vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, communications costs,&#13;
banking fees, transportation costs, meeting expenses, advertisement fees, representation, and&#13;
office security arrangements.&#13;
D.    INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
34.   The World Bank is supporting the MOH to undertake the emergency rehabilitation of 12&#13;
hospital emergency units throughout Iraq, including provision of civil works, medical equipment,&#13;
priority emergency pharmaceuticals for the 12 sites, and technical assistance and training to&#13;
strengthen the performance of the emergency teams in these sites, as well as to develop greater&#13;
capacity within the MOH in the areas of: health systems management and planning, procurement&#13;
and financial management, and procurement and distribution of drugs.&#13;
35.   This section describes in detail the implementation of the Emergency Health&#13;
Rehabilitation Project, which will provide urgent support in the areas described above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
36.   This project is the first in the health sector to be financed from the World Bank Iraq Trust&#13;
Fund (ITF) within the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). The Ministry&#13;
of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC) is the Government's designated donor&#13;
coordination agency for Iraq's reconstruction program.&#13;
37.   A Project Management Team (PMT) will be established to coordinate and manage the&#13;
Emergency Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP) under the authority of the Ministry of Health.&#13;
The PMT will have the responsibility for the day-to-day management, coordination and&#13;
monitoring of the Project activities. The Project will adopt the management structure put in&#13;
place for EHRP (Annex 3).&#13;
38.   The PMT will: (i) coordinate project implementation, and manage the resources of the&#13;
project; (ii) procure all Bank-financed goods and services under the project; (iii) operate the&#13;
financial management system according to World Bank requirements; (iv) act as liaison between&#13;
the technical agencies involved in the project and the World Bank; and (v) carry out, on an&#13;
annual basis, an independent audit of the project. Specifically, in its management capacity, the&#13;
PMT will ensure that: (a) the project activities are well-coordinated; (b) issues affecting or&#13;
potentially affecting project implementation are identified and addressed in a timely manner; (c)&#13;
technical advice is provided to project component coordinators and relevant MOH staff in how to&#13;
develop work plans, write terms of reference, and effectively manage consultant services; (d)&#13;
safeguard issues are addressed in compliance with the Environmental and Social Assessment&#13;
Framework (ESSAF); (e) necessary project inputs are provided in a timely and cost-effective&#13;
manner; (f) project resources are appropriately managed in accordance with Bank requirements&#13;
for procurement and financial management; (g) effective project monitoring and progress&#13;
reporting are carried out; and (h) there is a systematic out-reach to various stakeholders to&#13;
promote project objectives.&#13;
39.   Since most of the project activities will take place in selected hospitals, the PMT/MOH&#13;
and the MOH Directorates at the Governorate level will need to agree on operational and&#13;
administrative procedures prior to implementation. As ownership, participation and commitment&#13;
of the local health authorities are critical for the successful implementation of the project, much&#13;
attention will be given to this process. A detailed implementation plan for each of the&#13;
components is in Annex 9.&#13;
40.   All procurement for project activities will be carried out at the central MOH level, with&#13;
participation as needed from the MOH Directorates level. Given the urgency of this project, it&#13;
has been decided that a technical assistance firm will be selected under the project to provide&#13;
support and training to the PMT in procurement. This support will involve: (i) preparing civil&#13;
works design and tender documents; (ii) preparing tender documents for medical equipment; (iii)&#13;
providing support and advice in carrying out of tendering and selection procedures for both&#13;
rehabilitation and medical equipment; and (iv) giving on-the-job training to the PMT staff and&#13;
other relevant staff within the MOH. The technical assistance firm for this assignment should&#13;
have extensive prior experience in World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, as well&#13;
as the technical and logistics capacity to provide this support within the current security&#13;
environment in Baghdad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Implementation of Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services&#13;
41.   The activities under this component cover physical rehabilitation of existing hospital&#13;
emergency unit facilities and the provision of priority medical equipment and furniture for these&#13;
facilities. Responsibility for the implementation of this component will rest with the MOH/PMT&#13;
in coordination with the health authorities at the Directorate and hospital levels. The MOH&#13;
Department responsible for the rehabilitation activities will be the Operations Department, and&#13;
the Directorate of Specialized Medical Services will be responsible for the delivery of the&#13;
medical equipment. The PMT will coordinate with these departments to ensure that the activities&#13;
are carried out according to the project implementation plan. To accelerate the start-up process,&#13;
each hospital emergency unit will hire a different consultant firm to prepare the architectural&#13;
design for the site. These firms will be managed by the MOH Govemorate level engineer, in&#13;
coordination with the hospital management.&#13;
42.   For the medical equipment, the MOH has already prepared generic lists, and 20 items&#13;
have been identified for procurement. These items range from US$360 to US$45,000, and have&#13;
been selected based on criteria agreed between the MOH and the Bank. The procurement and&#13;
delivery of the medical equipment for the 12 selected facilities will be carried out in coordination&#13;
with the rehabilitation activities, to ensure that the delivery and installation take place at the&#13;
appropriate point in the rehabilitation process. In addition, preliminary plans have been prepared&#13;
by the MOH for the use of temporary substitute sites7 for the emergency facilities that will be&#13;
rehabilitated to ensure that the emergency services are not compromised by the project activities&#13;
during the rehabilitation phase.&#13;
Implementation of Component 2: Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs&#13;
43.   Procurement and distribution of the essential emergency pharmaceuticals to the 12&#13;
selected hospital emergency services units will be the responsibility of the MOH. The drug lists&#13;
and quantities have already been prepared, and the procurement specialists of the PMT will&#13;
prepare the tender documents. The pharmaceuticals will be procured through one tender, using&#13;
ICB procedures except for one direct contract for the procurement of alteplase injection as there&#13;
is only single manufacturing source in the world. A Special Committee will be established by&#13;
the MOH to evaluate the bids and select the winning bidder.&#13;
44.   According to the contract conditions, the delivery of the pharmaceuticals will be directly&#13;
to the selected hospitals. The MOH will form a committee to receive the pharmaceuticals and&#13;
ensure that they are consistent with the contract. The hospital Director will have overall&#13;
responsibility for the appropriate storage and disposition of the pharmaceuticals that are&#13;
received. Technical assistance will also be provided to assist the MOH to develop an improved&#13;
drug supply chain for the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Implementation of Component 3: Capacity Building and Training&#13;
45.   Responsibility for the implementation of this component will rest with MOH/PMT in&#13;
coordination with the Directorate of Specialized Medical Services and the Center for Training&#13;
and Human Development. The PMT will be responsible for ensuring the provision and&#13;
coordination of necessary inputs with the necessary departments.&#13;
46.   Activities under this component cover the capacity-building and training activities in&#13;
Emergency Medical Services for the 12 selected sites.  MOH/PMT will coordinate the&#13;
emergency medical services activities with the Directorate of Specialized Medical Services and&#13;
will ensure that the following training activities are conducted: (i) technical training of five-&#13;
person emergency teams from each selected site to improve the quality of emergency services;&#13;
(ii) training in management of emergency services for the hospital directors, emergency chief&#13;
doctors, head nurses and central-level emergency services planners; and (iii) the development of&#13;
a national plan for strengthening emergency health care services. Additionally, the PMT will&#13;
coordinate the MOH health systems management and planning training with the Center for&#13;
Training and Human Development. These trainings will involve MOH staff in these areas from&#13;
both central and Directorate levels.&#13;
Implementation of Component 4: Project Management&#13;
47.   The Ministry of Health will be responsible for ensuring that the PMT is duly established&#13;
and staffed with sufficient expertise and skills to carry out the implementation of the project. In&#13;
addition, the MOH is responsible for securing adequate office space within the Ministry for the&#13;
PMT. The PMT will act as both the coordinating unit for technical implementation of the&#13;
components, and the "business office" for the project.&#13;
48.   The PMT will comprise: (i) a Director, who is responsible for coordinating the day-to-&#13;
day project activities, as well as the business office functions of project management, and liaising&#13;
with the World Bank and the MOH Departments implementing project components; (ii) a&#13;
Deputy Director, who supports the Director in overall management of the PMT, as well as&#13;
providing back-up to the Director in his/her absence; (iii) a Technical Coordinator who will&#13;
ensure coordination of the technical aspects of the project; (iv) a Financial Officer and&#13;
Accountant; (v) a Procurement Officer and three specialists (civil works, equipment/drugs, and&#13;
consultant services); and (vi) an Executive Secretary and Junior Secretary. In addition, there will&#13;
be drivers for the three project vehicles and a messenger.&#13;
49.   The PMT staff will have the opportunity through the Project to receive training relevant&#13;
to their assignments, in the areas of procurement, financial management, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and in project management. Initial courses in these areas have already been provided&#13;
to selected MOH staff by the Bank outside of Iraq in the region during the preparation period,&#13;
and these will be continued penrodically under the project.&#13;
50.   Experience with health projects within the region has shown that clear definition of&#13;
implementation procedures, including the PMT responsibilities and support to project activities,&#13;
is a very important element of a successful project. In order to achieve this objective, the MOH&#13;
will select well-qualified staff for the PMT, including a full-time Deputy PMT Director and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Technical Coordinator to support the PMT Director, to ensure that the appropriate oversight and&#13;
management of the project activities are in place. The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is&#13;
being prepared in conjunction with the relevant technical staff in the MOH central and&#13;
Govemorate offices. However, it is recognized that the PIM is a starting point intended to ensure&#13;
clear understanding between the implementing agency and the Bank, and is not to be used as a&#13;
"straight jacket". The PJIM can be revised during project implementation with the mutual&#13;
agreement of the Bank and Government.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
General&#13;
51.   Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May&#13;
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement. The general description&#13;
of various items under different expenditure categories is given below. For each contract to be&#13;
financed by the Grant, the procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for&#13;
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between&#13;
the Recipient and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan (PP). The PP will be updated as&#13;
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional&#13;
capacity. A general procurement notice was published in the UNDB in November 2004 and will&#13;
be revised after approval.&#13;
52.   Procurement of Works. Works procured under this project will include rehabilitation of&#13;
hospital emergency units. Due to the small value of each contract and the volatile security&#13;
conditions in Iraq, it is not expected that international contractors will be interested in the works&#13;
contracts. All procurement of works will follow National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Thus, no&#13;
contract is expected to be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures;&#13;
however, international contractors would be eligible to bid on NCB contracts if they choose to&#13;
participate. The procurement based on NCB procedure will be done using the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Document (SBD) for small works. Once an NCB bidding document for works is&#13;
prepared (currently under preparation as part of the Master Implementation Manual (MIM)),&#13;
reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank, it will be used instead of the Bank's SBD for NCB&#13;
procurement.&#13;
53.   Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project will include procurement of&#13;
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, hospital furniture, office furniture, computers and&#13;
office supplies needed by the MOH-PMT for the project implementation. The procurement will&#13;
be done using ICB, NCB, Shopping procedures, and in exceptional cases, Direct Contracting&#13;
may be used for procurement of goods of small value such as office supplies and equipment as&#13;
described in the procurement plan. Pharmaceuticals and medical equipment will be procured&#13;
using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and the SBD for procurement of&#13;
health goods. Single source will only be used in exceptional cases for the procurement of&#13;
pharmaceuticals. Although the preferred method for the procurement of pharmaceuticals is&#13;
based on grouping the items into lots, it seems that the list of pharmaceuticals to be purchased&#13;
under the project may not be grouped into lots that will attract responsive bids from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
manufacturers. Thus, it is expected that the procurement of pharmaceuticals will be on an item-&#13;
by-item basis. The procurement based on NCB procedure will be done using the Bank's SBD&#13;
for procurement of goods. Once an NCB bidding document for goods is prepared (currently&#13;
under preparation as part of the Master Implementation Manual), reviewed and found&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, it will be used instead of the Bank's SBD for NCB procurement.&#13;
54.   Selection of Consultants. Consultant services procured under this project will include: (i)&#13;
selection of an international procurement consulting firm to support the building of MOH&#13;
capacity to manage procurement activities; (ii) selection of individual consultants and/or firms to&#13;
provide training and assessment studies in the pharmaceutical sector; (iii) capacity building in&#13;
financial management; and (iv) selection of local consulting firms to provide consultancy&#13;
services in engineering, bidding document preparation and construction supervision. The&#13;
procurement consulting firm will be selected based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ)&#13;
procedures. All consulting services including those for architectural design and supervision will&#13;
be selected based on CQ procedures with the exceptions of selection of five PMT consultants&#13;
and the pharmaceutical sector consultants which will use selection procedures for individual&#13;
consultants&#13;
55.   Operating Costs: The Grant will finance expenditures directly related to the management&#13;
of the project, such as: (i) maintenance of office equipment; (ii) transportation and travel,&#13;
including per diem allowances for Project staff in travel status; (iii) office supplies, utilities and&#13;
office administration, including translation, printing and advertising; (iv) fuel costs; (v)&#13;
communication costs; (vi) costs for production of bidding documents and drawings; and (vii)&#13;
commercial bank charges. No salaries of the Recipient's civil servants will be financed under the&#13;
project. The operating costs that will be financed by the project will be procured using the MOH&#13;
administrative procedures for shopping satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
56.   A generic assessment of Iraqi ministries' capacity to implement project procurement was&#13;
conducted in March 2004. Given that the security conditions prevented the Bank project team&#13;
from traveling to Iraq at the time of project preparation, a quick assessment of the capacity of the&#13;
MOH to implement procurement actions for the project was also carried out by the team's Senior&#13;
Procurement Specialist in October 2004 through discussions with MOH staff in Jordan during&#13;
the pre-appraisal/appraisal of the project. Subsequently, the generic assessment has been revised&#13;
to reflect the MOH's capacity to implement procurement.&#13;
57.   Procurement activities for the project will be carried out by the PMT, in collaboration&#13;
with relevant departments of MOH. There is no centralized procurement department in the&#13;
current organizational structure of the MOH. Procurement is carried out by each department of&#13;
the MOH. There will be separate committees for bid opening and bid analysis and evaluation.&#13;
These committees would be established on ad hoc basis, with a minimum of three members from&#13;
different departments.&#13;
58.   At the MOH Headquarters, the Directorate of Projects and Engineering Services&#13;
prepares/reviews bidding documents, including drawings, bill of quantities, general and special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
contract conditions and technical specifications for priority health care and hospital rehabilitation&#13;
and new construction. In the past, the MOH has implemented more than 30 new additions and&#13;
rehabilitation of primary health care projects, valued at approximately US$50 million.&#13;
59.   A Ministerial decree has been issued recently stipulating that procurement for major&#13;
hospitals with a value of less than 50 million Iraqi Dinars can be conducted at the hospital level.&#13;
For contracts valued at less than 300 million Iraqi Dinars, procurement can be conducted at the&#13;
Health Directorate level. For amounts above this threshold, the Directorate can advertise,&#13;
receive, open, evaluate bids, but has to get the approval from the Ministry for final&#13;
recommendation to award and endorsement before signing the contracts.&#13;
60.   KIMADIA is the State Company for the Marketing of Drugs and Medical Appliances&#13;
which operates as a department of the Ministry of Health in Iraq. KIMADIA has managed the&#13;
procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment for MOH for many years, mainly&#13;
through the medium of tendering to a list of registered manufacturers and suppliers. KIMADIA&#13;
has the following main responsibilities: (i) purchasing from all local and international&#13;
companies; (ii) distribution of drugs, medical supplies and equipment according to the needs of&#13;
health institutions nationally; (iii) maintenance and servicing of medical equipment in health&#13;
institutions; and (iv) procurement, receipt, warehousing and distribution of pharmaceuticals and&#13;
hospital supplies and equipment.&#13;
61.   All manufacturers and suppliers wishing to supply to the MOH need to be registered as a&#13;
supply source. The process involves submission of technical information on the company and its&#13;
products and of samples. The samples undergo testing in the laboratories of the drug regulatory&#13;
authority which involves significant delays due to recent damage to the laboratories. Because of&#13;
these delays, it has been agreed that for any unregistered suppliers wishing to participate in the&#13;
Bank-financed tender, the requirement to supply samples will be waived provided the bidders&#13;
can provide evidence that they have FDA and/or EU approval to supply their products.&#13;
62.   It has long been acknowledged that KIMADIA will need substantial capacity building to&#13;
incorporate the principles of open competitive tendering. KIMADIA and the MOH on whose&#13;
behalf they act will gain significant benefit from training in the methodologies of internationally&#13;
accepted procurement practices. This training is supported under the proposed project, both&#13;
through provision of technical specialists to support the day-to-day management of procurement,&#13;
and through training courses.&#13;
63.   To strengthen the procurement capacity of the MOH, a procurement officer will be&#13;
appointed to the MOH-PMT. A simple PIM is under preparation (it is expected that the manual&#13;
will be ready by December 31, 2004) and the MOH-PMT will use this manual in the&#13;
implementation of the project. The PIM will be aligned with the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
as soon as the latter becomes available. The MIM is a global manual for all the projects under&#13;
the ITF.&#13;
64.   Private Sector Assessment. The private sector, local and foreign, participates in public&#13;
procurement of goods and services. Registration of national contractors by the MOPDC is a&#13;
routine practice. Contractors are classified and ranked against criteria, including experience,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
performance, and financial status. There are some 160 contractors classified as class A. A&#13;
procuring entity may limit the invitation to bid to certain classes of contractors. Based on a&#13;
meeting with the head of the contractors' union in Iraq during the mission in Amman, local&#13;
contractors appear to be capable of executing the type of works contracts proposed under the&#13;
project, and even much larger projects. Demonstration of financial capacity of contractors may&#13;
be a difficult task as they are accustomed to working on a cash basis, especially during the&#13;
previous era. The contractors demonstrated that they have no problem getting bid securities&#13;
from local banks, and welcomed very much the opportunity for training on bid preparation.&#13;
Training on bid preparation is planned as part of the scope of work of the international&#13;
procurement consulting firm.&#13;
65.   There are several local consulting firms that appear to be capable of carrying out the&#13;
design, preparation of bidding documents and construction supervision. However, the local&#13;
consulting firms have no previous experience with preparation of proposals, and the quality of&#13;
their work still would need to be tested. Training on proposal preparation is planned as part of&#13;
the scope of work of the international procurement consulting firm.&#13;
66.   On the basis of the above information and analysis, it can be assumed that local private&#13;
sector contractors will be able to compete for and execute the contracts under this project.&#13;
67.   The Bank procurement speciaiist has already provided a quick training session on&#13;
procurement terminology and Bank procurement procedures to the MOH team. The procurement&#13;
officer for the project has been assigned by H.E. the Minister of Health during the appraisal&#13;
mission. The procurement officer attended procurement training conducted by the World Bank&#13;
Procurement Specialist in March - April, 2004 during his assignment on the ITF-financed&#13;
Emergency School Construction and Rehabilitation Project. The training included procurement&#13;
planning, bidding document preparation, procurement guidelines, procedures and methods for&#13;
procurement of works, goods and selection of consultants. Further procurement training will be&#13;
provided throughout project implementation by the procurement consulting firm and during the&#13;
Project launch workshop. During the mission, the procurement officer started preparing the&#13;
bidding documents for the procurement of pharmaceutical drugs with assistance from the Bank&#13;
team.&#13;
68.   The overall project risk for procurement is rated as high. Most of the issues and risks&#13;
concerning procurement under the project have been identified in the generic assessment of the&#13;
MOH's capacity to implement project procurement and include: (i) the lack of sound laws and&#13;
regulations, the lack of modem standard documentation, and the routine practices acquired by&#13;
procurement staff, specially those in KIMADIA, during the previous era which will take time to&#13;
change; (ii) weakness of MOH procurement staff in use of Bank procurement guidelines and&#13;
international sound procurement practices; (iii) inability of Bank procurement staff to supervise&#13;
the project in the field; (iv) delays in implementing the procurement plan due to lack of&#13;
experience in procurement planning and the volatile security conditions in Iraq; (v) increase of&#13;
prices of construction raw materials due to high demand and unavailability of these materials&#13;
which may impact subproject completion due to the unwillingness of contractors to continue&#13;
working based on old contract prices; (vi) possible looting of construction sites as well as&#13;
leakage of drugs outside the MOH stores to the private sector; and (vii) delays in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
implementation of some contracts as well as in bid submission, due to deteriorating security&#13;
conditions in some areas of the country.&#13;
69.   The corrective measures which have been agreed are: (i) a procurement officer is already&#13;
assigned as part of the MOH-PMT; (ii) simplified bidding documents and methods such as&#13;
shopping and NCB, a Bank bidding document for small works, the US Dollar as currency of bids&#13;
for NCB, and shopping will be used; (iii) in the contract, a statement will be included that&#13;
contractors will be responsible for guarding hospital construction sites during construction, and&#13;
an inventory of hospital fixtures will be documented before the contractor starts working. The&#13;
contractor will be responsible for these fixtures at the time of final handover of the project; (iv)&#13;
to mitigate the problem of inability of some contractors from a different locale to work in certain&#13;
areas of Iraq due to the security conditions, a clause in the works bidding document would be&#13;
added requesting bidders to provide a methodology for accessing the hospital site and&#13;
contractor's ability to work; (v) a decree was issued on June 23, 2004, by the Minister of Health&#13;
to rectify the shortcomings in the current procurement practice; and (vi) the procured drugs and&#13;
the medical equipment will be delivered directly to the 12 rehabilitated hospitals and not stored&#13;
in KIMADIA central stores. In addition, an international procurement consulting firm will be&#13;
hired by the MOH to build MOH capacities to: carry out and manage procurement activities; set&#13;
up within the MOH a procurement monitoring and reporting system; assist the MOH-PMT in&#13;
preparing/reviewing bidding documents and bid evaluation reports; and build procurement&#13;
capacity in the MOH. The procurement consulting firm will also conduct workshops for the local&#13;
contractors and local consultants on bid preparation and proposal preparation, respectively. In&#13;
addition, the consulting firm will be available to respond to ad hoc requests for advice or&#13;
training. Until security conditions in Iraq improve, training workshops may take place outside&#13;
the country (preferably in a neighboring country). An action plan will also be prepared by the&#13;
MOH-PMT to train the MOH staff in the Govemorates and in KIMADIA on procurement.&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
70.   The MOH, at appraisal, prepared a Procurement Plan (Annex 4) for project&#13;
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods to be used in this Project.&#13;
This plan was agreed between the MOH and the Bank project team on October 7, 2004, and will&#13;
be available in the project's database and on the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan&#13;
will be updated in agreement with the Project Team as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
71.   In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, and based&#13;
on the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency, at least one supervision mission is&#13;
planned every three months to visit the field to carry out post reviews of procurement. Until&#13;
security conditions make travel to Iraq possible for Bank staff, the Bank will employ Monitoring&#13;
Agents, independent firms which will operate in Iraq and support the Bank in carrying out its&#13;
supervision function, including spot physical inspection. In addition, the Bank will rely on&#13;
reports from a local procurement consultant who is working for the Bank from within Iraq.&#13;
During the interim period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement staff will meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
outside Iraq to carry out off-site supervision as well as using videoconference facilities to&#13;
maintain effective communication on the progress of the Project.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
72.   The proposed grant of US$25 million is expected to be disbursed by December 31, 2006.&#13;
Annex 5, Table A describes the allocation of the grant proceeds according to each expenditure&#13;
category.&#13;
*73.   The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient&#13;
entities. Trained Project Management Teams (PMTs) will facilitate implementation and help&#13;
ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs will be employed and paid by the&#13;
implementing agency at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone&#13;
Project Implementation Units, which can erode civil service institutional capacity over the&#13;
medium and long term. The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement,&#13;
financial management, and other areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds are&#13;
used for the purposes intended and to help carry out project supervision, the Bank will employ&#13;
two independent firms as fiduciary and safeguard Monitoring Agents.&#13;
74.   As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct&#13;
payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the MOH,&#13;
direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the contractor,&#13;
consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the&#13;
international banking system.&#13;
75.   The project management component and payments below the threshold of US$10,000&#13;
normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These&#13;
payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic basis, by&#13;
the Bank to the MOH upon presentation of full supporting documents, proof of payment and a&#13;
signed withdrawal application. The Bank may later require the use of Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE) for payments below US$10,000. The MOH-PMT and the main financial counterparts&#13;
from the MOH will be subject to intensive training in Bank disbursement procedures.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
76.   Bank policies require that grant proceeds be used for the purposes for which they were&#13;
granted, with due regard to economy, efficiency, and the sustainable achievement of the project's&#13;
development objectives. The Recipient (MOH) is required in this regard, to maintain an&#13;
appropriate and adequate financial management system, including records and accounts, and to&#13;
prepare financial statements that accurately reflect the project operations, resources, and&#13;
expenditures. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement also commits the Recipient to have the accounts,&#13;
records, and financial statements of the grant audited for each fiscal year by a qualified auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Administrator following internationally accepted standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
77.   Financial Management Risk Assessment. The financial management risk associated with&#13;
this operation is considered high. Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents&#13;
onsite Bank supervision and assessments, including financial management assessments; (ii) the&#13;
Bank's limited knowledge of Iraq's public financial management systems, controls, and&#13;
procedures; (iii) the limited knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and&#13;
guidelines; (iv) the possibility of MOH not making available on a timely basis financial&#13;
resources to honor payments below the value of US$10,000; (v) difficult communication and&#13;
flow of information between worksites and the PMT, which could delay payments; (vi)&#13;
inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that may delay payments and transfer of funds to&#13;
contractors, suppliers, or MOH; and (vii) variation order requests that may exceed price&#13;
contingencies and difficulties may be encountered in verifying justifications for variation orders.&#13;
Although the project design mitigates these risks to the extent possible, the project will require&#13;
close monitoring and supervision during implementation.&#13;
78.   The control risks will be mitigated by putting in place additional controls and procedures,&#13;
including: (i) the PMT will verify and authorize all payments under the project and verify&#13;
justifications for variation orders; (ii) the PMT will be assigned competent financial staff from&#13;
the MOH who will be supported, as needed, by financial management consultants; (iii) the MOH&#13;
has identified qualified staff from the MOH finance department, including the internal auditor,&#13;
who will track the project activities, ensuring that the MOH team is well-informed about Bank&#13;
guidelines and policies and is able to track project transactions and provide support to the PMT;&#13;
(iv) disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily through direct payments supported by&#13;
documentation; (v) the fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and&#13;
withdrawal applications; and (vi) appropriate training of finance staff at the PMT will be&#13;
provided.&#13;
79.   The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple parallel&#13;
accounting system to record all project expenditures, monitor project commitments in real time&#13;
during the implementation period, and provide the data needed to generate project reporting,&#13;
including the Bank required Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR).&#13;
80.   With respect to project auditing arrangements, an external independent auditor with&#13;
international experience will be engaged to perform the project audits and issue an independent&#13;
opinion on project financial statements. This external audit report will encompass all project&#13;
activities and will be presented in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards.&#13;
The audit report along with the related financial statements should be submitted to the Bank not&#13;
later than four months after the end of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
81.   All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a chapter of the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual which will be in line with the Master Implementation Manual (MIM).&#13;
Details on project risks, mitigation measures, and financial management arrangements are in&#13;
Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
82.   Project activities will be completed by December 2006. Supervision will include visits to&#13;
the MOH, MOF, MOPDC, and to hospital sites for the purpose of reviewing implementation&#13;
progress, impact of project activities, and related documentation.&#13;
83.   The MOH-PMT will prepare and send to the Bank a quarterly progress report. The first&#13;
report will be due starting at the end of the first quarter following the initial disbursement. The&#13;
format of the report has been agreed during appraisal.&#13;
84.   The Bank, as the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) Administrator, will supervise ITF-funded&#13;
operations in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. While staff travel&#13;
to Iraq is restricted, supervision of recipient-executed operations will be carried out through&#13;
consultants and the Monitoring Agents. Each ITF-funded operation is required to include a&#13;
results-based supervision plan that reflects realities on the ground.&#13;
85.   Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in&#13;
respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90)&#13;
days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the Bank&#13;
will prepare, on a cash basis, an un-audited statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund&#13;
balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such statement will be&#13;
expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds will be maintained by&#13;
the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the completion of all&#13;
disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis&#13;
an un-audited financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the&#13;
ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
86.   The Bank will furnish the donors:&#13;
(a) on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the ITF&#13;
(including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in the&#13;
preceding six months; and&#13;
(b) on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from the&#13;
Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
87.   The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal&#13;
costs of the Bank with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank will provide&#13;
each donor with a copy of the auditor's report.&#13;
88.   The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The Bank&#13;
will provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of&#13;
the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents. Within six months of completion of the&#13;
activities, or of full disbursement of the contributions, whichever comes later, the Bank will&#13;
provide a final progress report to each donor, together with a copy of the independent review of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
the performance of the Monitoring Agents. Upon request by any donor, the Bank will send to&#13;
such donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank from the Monitoring Agents on the&#13;
activities financed by the contributions.&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
89.   Environmental Safeguards: The Project is rated category "B". Impacts would be those&#13;
associated mainly with (i) rehabilitation works (e.g., safety, dust, noise, waste material, traffic);&#13;
(ii) provision of sanitary services, water supply and waste management; and (iii) maintenance of&#13;
facilities. Because of the emergency conditions, the requirement to carry out a limited&#13;
Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation will be waived. However, for sub-projects&#13;
with adverse environmental impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be done during&#13;
project implementation but before sub-project approval. The Environmental and Social&#13;
Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) was disclosed in the country and in the&#13;
Infoshop on October 7, 2004. Based on the ESSAF, the following standards will be applied&#13;
during implementation: (i) inclusion of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the&#13;
rehabilitation and extension bid documents of all sub-projects (Annex 7A); (ii) use of Safeguard&#13;
Procedures for Inclusion in the Technical Specifications of Contracts (Annex 7B); (iii) use of the&#13;
Checklist of likely Environmental and Social Impacts of Subproject; (iv) review and oversight of&#13;
any major reconstruction works by specialists; (v) implementation of environmentally and&#13;
socially sound options for civil works; and (vi) provision for adequate .budget and satisfactory&#13;
institutional arrangements to monitor effective implementation and adequately maintain sanitary&#13;
facilities after completion. Capacity building on Safeguards and on the implementation of the&#13;
ESSAF has already been undertaken with the Ministry of Environment and other line Ministries.&#13;
Details on the handling of medical and non-medical waste are in Annex 7.&#13;
90.   Resettlement and Land Acquisition: There will be no construction of new facilities in the&#13;
Project. However, there will be some site extensions that will be limited to vacant sites that are&#13;
on public property assigned by the relevant authorities for the use of MOH. OP 4.12 should not&#13;
be triggered since there should not be any displacement of populations or new land acquisition.&#13;
However, the ESSAF, specifically elaborated for due diligence in the case of Iraq, should be&#13;
used to ensure that this is indeed the case and should there be any need for land acquisition or&#13;
population resettlement, the same guidelines will be followed.&#13;
91.   An MOH-PMT specialist will be trained in WB safeguards policies and MOH&#13;
engineering staff (or consultants where capacity is lacking) will carry out site supervisions to&#13;
check on compliance of contractors with environmental and social safeguards. Site supervision&#13;
reports will include a section on environmental and social safeguards that will be filed with the&#13;
MOH-PMT. The first three site supervision reports will be sent to the Bank for review.&#13;
E.    FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
92.   This project is prepared as part of the interim strategy of the World Bank in addressing&#13;
the pressing needs of the sector and according to the emergency recovery assistance procedures&#13;
(OP 8.50). The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic information, and the speed at&#13;
which the project has been prepared have prevented more detailed analysis, a familiar constraint&#13;
in such operations. However, the benefits of the project's investment are expected to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
substantial compared to its costs, as it addresses urgent needs in an environment of devastated&#13;
infrastructure, deteriorating quality, and escalating needs. The project will support the&#13;
rehabilitation of 12 hospital emergency facilities in 9 Govemorates.        It is estimated that&#13;
approximately 14,500,000 persons living in the surrounding perimeters of the rehabilitated&#13;
facilities will have access to high quality emergency medical services that otherwise would not&#13;
have been adequately delivered. This Project will support expansion of the emergency room&#13;
capacity in the selected sites, improve the quality of emergency services, and reduce mortality, as&#13;
well as building the technical and management capacity of the MOH.&#13;
93.    Recurrent costs of the facilities rehabilitated by the Project will be met from the MOH&#13;
operational budget. Future maintenance costs of the 12 rehabilitated and equipped facilities will&#13;
be covered by the overall MOH budget and do not constitute a sustainability problem. However,&#13;
the sustainability of the pharmaceuticals procurement could become an issue during the medium&#13;
term. This being said, the expected resumption of oil exports in Iraq and the economic reform&#13;
policies that are being introduced are expected to stimulate sustainable growth over the medium&#13;
term and provide resources for such types of expenditure.&#13;
F. RISKS&#13;
94.    The political and security environment in Iraq is currently very unstable and uncertain,&#13;
and poses obvious risks to the proposed project. The table below provides a summary of the key&#13;
project risks that have been identified, and the measures to be taken to mitigate those risks.&#13;

4. Direct Contracting/Purchase  All&#13;
2.    Reference to Project Implementation Manual&#13;
The Project Management Team (MOH-PMT) will prepare a simple Project Implementation&#13;
Manual (PIM) by December 2004. The PIM will be adapted to conform to the Master&#13;
Implementation Manual (MIM) when it is finalized. The MIM is being prepared by an&#13;
international consulting firm financed under the capacity building trust fund for Iraq, and is&#13;
planned to be finalized by December 2004.&#13;
3.    Any Other Special Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Not applicable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
4.    Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
It is not expected that international contractors would be interested in the works contracts under&#13;
this project, especially under the current security situation in Iraq and the scattered locations of&#13;
the subprojects. Thus, no contract is expected to be procured using ICB procedures. There is no&#13;
domestic preference under the project. A detailed procurement plan is included in this annex.&#13;
III. SELECTION OF CONSULTANTS&#13;
1.    Prior Review Threshold: Selection decisions subject to Prior Review by Bank as stated&#13;
in Appendix 1 to the Guidelines Selection and Employment of Consultants:&#13;
Selection Method        Prior Review Threshold       Comments&#13;
1. Services from firms or individuals  First three contracts regardless&#13;
of value.&#13;
1. Competitive Methods (Firms)  &gt;=US$100,000&#13;
2. Single Source (Firms)      All&#13;
3. Individual Consultants     &gt;=US$50,000&#13;
4. Single Source (individual)  All&#13;
2.    Short list comprised entirely of national consultants&#13;
A short list of consultants for services, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, may be comprised entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
3.    Any Other Special Selection Arrangements&#13;
The selection of a procurement consulting firm will be based on Consultants' Qualifications&#13;
(CQs). The security conditions in Iraq may not attract international consultants to work in Iraq.&#13;
It is also expected that international consulting firms may not be interested in the preparation of&#13;
hospital rehabilitation bidding documents and construction supervision of the hospitals while the&#13;
security situation is volatile. Based on this, short lists for all consulting services for engineering&#13;
services and bidding document preparation and construction supervision of hospitals may be&#13;
composed entirely of national consulting firms. The method for selection of these consulting&#13;
firms is proposed to be CQs to speed up the implementation of the project. It is also expected&#13;
that consulting offices associated with local universities may be included in the short lists.&#13;
University-based consultants shall not have preference over private consultants.&#13;
4.    Consultancy Assignments with Selection Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
These are indicated in the attached procurement plan.&#13;

ANNEX 5: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
1. The project financial resources will be managed within the framework of the Iraqi public&#13;
financial management system. The grant funds will be made available to the MOH, which,&#13;
assisted by the MOH-PMT, will enter into contractual agreements with construction companies&#13;
and contractors, consultants, and vendors for the rehabilitation and construction activities&#13;
financed under the project.&#13;
2. Due to the security risk, the project financial management assessment was carried out in&#13;
Amman by interviewing Iraqi officials from MOH, and reviewing sample of documents used in&#13;
the financial management of the ministry. These interviews concentrated on: (i) identifying the&#13;
applicable procedures to introduce the grant proceeds as a supplement to the MOH budgets (ii)&#13;
assessing the current financial management practices at the MOH in order to identify the risks&#13;
associated with the control environment and the accounting, reporting and auditing procedures in&#13;
place; and (iii) proposing actions to reduce and manage such risks. Despite the limited&#13;
knowledge of the Recipient's systems and processes, this assessment showed that the systems in&#13;
place at MOH are based on principles and procedures defined by the legal framework and&#13;
operational decrees applicable to the public sector. The current control environment and&#13;
accounting systems would require strengthening and close monitoring in order to allow proper&#13;
use of funds and timely generation of monitoring reports4.&#13;
I. Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
3.    The financial management risk associated with this operation is considered high. Critical&#13;
risk factors are: (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision and assessments,&#13;
including financial management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge of Iraq's public&#13;
financial management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii) the limited knowledge on the part&#13;
of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv) the possibility of MMPW not making&#13;
available on a timely basis financial resources to honor payments below the value of US$10,000;&#13;
(v) difficult communication and flow of information between worksites and the PMT, which&#13;
could delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that delay payments and&#13;
transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or MMPW; and (vii) variation order requests that may&#13;
exceed price contingencies and difficulties may be encountered in verifying justification for&#13;
variation orders. Although the project design mitigates to the extent possible these risks, the&#13;
project will require close monitoring and supervision during implementation. A detailed risk&#13;
assessment may be found in Section VII.&#13;
II. Risk Mitigation Measures&#13;
4.    The overall high risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls&#13;
and appropriate procedures.&#13;
5.    The control risks will be mitigated as follows: (i) the MOH-PMT will verify and&#13;
authorize payments under the project; and verify justifications for variation orders (ii) the MOH-&#13;
4A special-purpose audit conducted by an international firm of selected Iraqi ministries had identified major&#13;
irregular financial transactions and significant control breaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
PMT will assign competent financial staff from the MOH who will be supported, as needed, by&#13;
expert financial management consultants; (iii) the MOH will identify the qualified staff from the&#13;
MOH finance department, including the internal auditor, who will track the project activities;&#13;
(iv) the PMT will use a full accounting process for the project, through a stand-alone simplified&#13;
accounting and reporting system (in addition to the MOH Accounting Department); (v) all&#13;
invoices/claims above US$10,000 will be paid through direct payments, while payments made&#13;
by MOH will be reimbursed by the Bank upon submission of appropriate documents to the&#13;
Bank; (vi) the fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and withdrawal&#13;
applications; and (vii) the project financial statements will be audited by an international audit&#13;
firm acceptable to the Bank, in addition to the regular audit conducted by the Government&#13;
Supreme Audit Institution. Application of these mitigation measures will help ensure that the&#13;
MOH team will be able to monitor the project transactions according to Bank requirements and&#13;
grant agreement provisions.&#13;
6.    The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple parallel&#13;
accounting system capable of recording all project expenditures and monitoring the project&#13;
commitments at any point during the implementation period, as well as generating project&#13;
reporting, including the Bank-required Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The project&#13;
accounting system will be installed after the project is declared effective, as the grant funds will&#13;
finance this system.&#13;
7.    All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a separate chapter of the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual which will be in line with the Master Implementation Manual.&#13;
III.  Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
8.    Accounting System. MOH currently uses a manual accounting system. To avoid the risk&#13;
of not generating timely reports for project management and monitoring purposes, parallel&#13;
arrangements will be implemented to overcome this shortcoming. The project accounting and&#13;
reporting activities will be undertaken by the PMT but in conjunction with MOH control&#13;
procedures and applicable laws. A simple computerized spreadsheet accounting system will be&#13;
used to track the grant accounts and generate reports including the Financial Monitoring reports&#13;
(FMRs). The PMT staff will include a financial officer and an accountant assisted by a financial&#13;
management consultant.&#13;
9.    Flow of Information. As per current control regulations, all invoices or work orders will&#13;
be signed and approved by the planning departments of individual governorates and will be&#13;
remitted to MOH-PMT for payment under cover letter signed by the MOH directorate at the&#13;
governorate level. Contracting and payment processes will be centralized at the PMT level. The&#13;
PMT will verify all claims and will maintain up-to-date invoice register and general ledger to&#13;
record all payments incurred. The MOH internal auditor designated to the project by the Minister&#13;
will perform ex-ante checking to all financial transactions.&#13;
10.   Financial Management Procedures. The project financial management procedures and&#13;
the parallel accounting system will be described in details in a chapter of the project&#13;
implementation Manual which will be in line with the Master Implementation Manual under&#13;
preparation by the Bank. The PMT assisted by an external consultant will prepare this manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
IV.   Project Reports&#13;
11.   Project reports should be remitted to the Bank following the agreed format and&#13;
frequency. The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and was agreed upon with&#13;
the MOH representatives during negotiations.&#13;
12.   Quarterly Reports. The MOH will generate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and&#13;
submit them to the Bank as part of the project progress report, or separately, within 45 days from&#13;
the end of the quarter. These FMRs include two sections:&#13;
* Financial Reports: to include a cash flow statement, beginning and ending project cash&#13;
balances and an expenditure report by activity or contract comparing actual and planned&#13;
expenditures. Also, a narrative report explaining major variances when compared to plan&#13;
and the proposed corrective actions should be included as an annex to the financial&#13;
reports.&#13;
* Contracts Reports: to include information on the major rehabilitation and construction&#13;
contracts, showing contract financial status against plan, including information on all&#13;
authorized contract variations.&#13;
13.   Annual Reports. Audited Project Financial Statements that will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank, no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, include:&#13;
a. Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating funds received and expenditures.&#13;
b. Appropriate schedules classifying project activities, showing cumulative balances.&#13;
c. Statement of payments made using statements of expenditures procedures, if allowed&#13;
later by the Bank, as defined in the legal agreement.&#13;
V.    Auditing Arrangements&#13;
14.   An extemal independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to perform&#13;
the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements. The&#13;
external audit report will encompass all of the project's activities and will be presented in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. MOH will remit a project audit&#13;
report to the Bank not later than four months after the end of the government fiscal year and&#13;
following the closing date of the Grant. The auditor selection process will be launched directly&#13;
after the grant agreement is signed. In addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a&#13;
"management letter" identifying any observations, comments, and deficiencies in the system and&#13;
controls that the auditor considers pertinent, and will provide recommendations for their&#13;
improvements. The audit will cover the expenditures made through direct payments as well as&#13;
expenditures reimbursed to the MOH, in terms of their substantiation and their eligibility and&#13;
compliance with the grant agreement. An escrow account will be used to pay the auditor after the&#13;
project closing date.&#13;
VI.   Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
15.   The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to implement projects though the Iraqi ministries (rather&#13;
than stand alone PIUs), working together to strengthen the ministries' controls, while at the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
time putting in place other measures to provide assurance such as independent monitoring&#13;
agents, technical support and supervision arrangements. As a further compensating control,&#13;
disbursements will be made primarily through direct payments by the Bank to the contractors,&#13;
consultants and vendors. Direct payment applications will be prepared by the MOH-PMT and&#13;
submitted to the Bank through the MOH. Authorized signatories, names and corresponding&#13;
specimens of their signatures will also be submitted to the Bank.&#13;
16.   The project management component costs and payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$10,000 will be honored through payments made available by the recipient of the grant from&#13;
its own resources. These payments made from the recipient's own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the Bank to the MOH upon presentation of a proof of payment and a&#13;
signed withdrawal application. The MOH-PMT and the main financial counterparts from MOH&#13;
will receive intensive training in Bank disbursement procedures.&#13;
17.   Allocation of Grant Proceeds. The proceeds of the Grant will be disbursed in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The proposed Project has been designed to be&#13;
implemented over a 24-month period. The disbursement arrangements are based on the Bank's&#13;
appraisal of the financial management capability of the implementing ministry, as well as the&#13;
experience and lessons learned from current and previous projects in the region. Grant funds are&#13;
expected to be fully disbursed by the Project Closing Date of December 31, 2006. The&#13;
disbursement categories and amounts and percentages to be financed under each category are&#13;
presented in Table A.&#13;

18.   Use of Statements of Expenditure. Initially, supporting documentation will be provided&#13;
to the Bank for all requests to disburse funds under the Grant. The Bank has the option to allow&#13;
expenditures under US$10,000 to be made by means of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). If&#13;
SOEs are allowed, the supporting documentation will be maintained at the MOH and made&#13;
available for review by the project auditors and the Bank representatives upon request; any&#13;
documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to one year from the date the Bank&#13;
receives the second grant audit report.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT&#13;
FRAMEWORK&#13;
Introduction. The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
will provide the general policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated&#13;
into the implementation the project (see Appendix A).&#13;
Potential Adverse Impact. The activities supported by the project comprise rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of hospital facilities. Potential adverse environmental impacts (summarized below) are&#13;
restricted in scope and severity:&#13;
* Dust and noise due to demolition and construction;&#13;
* Dumping of demolition and construction wastes and accidental spillage of machine oil,&#13;
lubricants, etc;&#13;
* Risk for inadequate use of hazardous anti termite chemicals during foundation works;&#13;
* Risk for inadequate handling of hazardous wastewater, waste gases and spillages of hazardous&#13;
material during operation of the hospitals; and&#13;
* Risk from inadequate handling of medical waste.&#13;
Handling of Medical and Non-medical Wastes. The inadequate handling and disposal of&#13;
medical wastes may lead to transmission of HIV, hepatitis, meningitis, and other infectious&#13;
diseases through injuries caused by syringe needles contaminated by human blood. The groups&#13;
most at risk are medical care workers, waste mandgement operators, and scavengers. The&#13;
management of medical wastes requires diligence and care from a chain of people, starting with&#13;
medical care staff, continuing through collection workers, and finishing with disposal operators.&#13;
It would be the responsibility of MOH to provide training courses for all staff involved in the&#13;
management of medical wastes to make them aware of hazards, especially from infected sharps,&#13;
as well as to educate patients and visitors on proper hygiene and cleanliness with respect to&#13;
waste. Public awareness campaigns should be held at the community level. The training of&#13;
personnel should not solely explain routine procedures, but should also cover emergency&#13;
procedures, such as what action should be taken as a result of a spillage of particular types of&#13;
waste, or in the case of an injury involving a needle. It would also be the responsibility of MOH&#13;
to develop and monitor supplies and consumer policies which aim to minimize the level of waste&#13;
generated as a result of the provision of services.&#13;
In order to ensure the safe and efficient handling and disposal of waste generated in the hospitals&#13;
it will be necessary to develop operational policies. These should be based upon the central&#13;
MOH principle of strict segregation between medical (clinical waste and sharps) and domestic&#13;
waste and appropriate disposal of cytotoxic waste.&#13;
In order to be compliant with emerging guidelines and promote an environmentally-conscious&#13;
approach to waste management, operational policies should also be based on the segregation of&#13;
domestic waste into organic, non-organic and recyclable categories.&#13;
Hospital Waste Management Plans. The establishment of Hospital Waste Management Plans is&#13;
not included in the proposed project for rehabilitation of Emergency Unit Buildings, but the issue&#13;
should be considered in future projects for rehabilitation and upgrading of hospitals in Iraq.&#13;
Factors that govern the hospital waste management strategies are the legislative and regulatory&#13;
framework, and the waste treatment and disposal costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
The medical waste should be collected by specialist contractors for treatment at central plants in&#13;
each district, located at the hospital or elsewhere in the municipality. Because landfill operations&#13;
may cause a loss of containment integrity and the dispersal of infectious waste, it is&#13;
recommended that all infectious waste shall be treated prior to disposal. The following standards&#13;
for waste management are recommended:&#13;
* Establishing standard operating procedures for each process used for treating infectious waste;&#13;
* Monitoring of all treatment processes in order to ensure efficient and effective treatment; and&#13;
* Using biological indicators to monitor treatment (other indicators may be used provided that&#13;
their effectiveness has been successively demonstrated).&#13;
Recommended techniques for treatment of infectious waste are steam sterilization, incineration,&#13;
microwave or ultraviolet heating systems, ionizing radiation or chemical treatment. The choice&#13;
of technique depends on which category of infectious waste is being treated. Infectious waste&#13;
that has been efficiently treated is no longer hazardous, and may therefore be mixed with and&#13;
disposed of as ordinary solid waste, provided the waste does not pose other hazards that are&#13;
subject to national regulations.&#13;
A Hospital Waste Management Plan should be based on the evaluation and implementation of&#13;
the following strategic actions:&#13;
*  Definition of waste management responsibilities and establishment bf a waste management&#13;
organization for the hospitals concerned, including provisions for decontamination services&#13;
to other enterprises (hospitals, clinics and institutions);&#13;
*  Provision of information, instruction and training of all staff involved in the waste&#13;
management;&#13;
*  Development of evaluation procedures for monitoring and quality assurance of the waste&#13;
management;&#13;
*  Identification and definition of categories of hospital waste;&#13;
*  Characterization of hospital waste streams and estimate on quantities of hospital waste&#13;
arisings (including waste streams for decontamination services to other hospitals, clinics and&#13;
institutions);&#13;
*  Development of a system for segregation of waste;&#13;
*  Organization of dedicated facilities, services and transports on site for the implementation of&#13;
segregation of hospital waste;&#13;
*  Organization of the waste marshalling area including the adoption of an appropriate&#13;
disinfection system for clinical waste (e.g., incinerator, microwave station);&#13;
*  Organization of transport of waste off site and final disposal of hospital waste;&#13;
*  Special treatment of hazardous waste water, exhaust air and waste gases;&#13;
*  Development of procedures for handling accidents, incidents and spillages; and&#13;
*  Assessment of the environmental impact and impact on public health.&#13;
The organization of transport of waste off-site and the final disposal of clinical waste are two of&#13;
the most critical environmental aspects to be included in the Hospital Waste Management Plan.&#13;

Contractor shall only clear the minimum width for construction and diversion roads should not&#13;
be constructed alongside the existing road.&#13;
3.    Remedial actions which cannot be effectively carried out during construction should be&#13;
carried out on completion of each Section of the road (earthworks, pavement and drainage) and&#13;
before issuance of the Taking Over Certificate:&#13;
(a) these sections should be landscaped and any necessary remedial works should be&#13;
undertaken without delay, including grassing and reforestation;&#13;
(b) water courses should be cleared of debris and drains and culverts checked for clear&#13;
flow paths; and&#13;
(c) borrow pits should be dressed as fish ponds, or drained and made safe, as agreed with&#13;
the land owner.&#13;
4.    The Contractor shall limit construction works to between 6 am and 7 pm if it is to be&#13;
carried out in or near residential areas.&#13;
5.    The Contractor shall avoid the use of heavy or noisy equipment in specified areas at&#13;
night, or in sensitive areas such as near a hospital.&#13;
6.    To prevent dust pollution during dry periods, the Contractor shall carry out regular&#13;
watering of earth and gravel haul roads and shall cover material haulage trucks with tarpaulins to&#13;
prevent spillage.&#13;
II.   Transport&#13;
7.    The Contractor shall use selected routes to the project site, as agreed with the Engineer,&#13;
and appropriately sized vehicles suitable to the class of road, and shall restrict loads to prevent&#13;
damage to roads and bridges used for transportation purposes. The Contractor shall be held&#13;
responsible for any damage caused to the roads and bridges due to the transportation of excessive&#13;
loads, and shall be required to repair such damage to the approval of the Engineer.&#13;

located in appropriate areas as approved by the Engineer and not within 500 meters of existing&#13;
residential settlements and not within 1,000 meters for asphalt plants.&#13;
15.   The Contractor shall ensure that site offices, depots and particularly storage areas for&#13;
diesel fuel and bitumen and asphalt plants are not located within 500 meters of watercourses, and&#13;
are operated so that no pollutants enter watercourses, either overland or through groundwater&#13;
seepage, especially during periods of rain. This will require lubricants to be recycled and a ditch&#13;
to be constructed around the area with an approved settling pond/oil trap at the outlet.&#13;
16.   The contractor shall not use fuelwood as a means of heating during the processing or&#13;
preparation of any materials forming part of the Works.&#13;
IV.   Quarries and Borrow Pits&#13;

to prior approval of the Engineer, and the operation shall cease if so instructed by the Engineer.&#13;
Borrow pits shall be prohibited where they might interfere with the natural or designed drainage&#13;
patterns. River locations shall be prohibited if they might undermine or damage the river banks,&#13;
or carry too much fine material downstream.&#13;
18.   The Contractor shall ensure that all borrow pits used are left in a trim and tidy condition&#13;
with stable side slopes, and are drained ensuring that no stagnant water bodies are created which&#13;
could breed mosquitoes.&#13;
19.   Rock or gravel taken from a river shall be far enough removed to limit the depth of&#13;
material removed to one-tenth of the width of the river at any one location, and not to disrupt the&#13;
river flow, or damage or undernine the river banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
20.   The location of crushing plants shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer, and not&#13;
be close to environmentally sensitive areas or to existing residential settlements, and shall be&#13;
operated with approved fitted dust control devices.&#13;
V.    Earthworks&#13;
21.   Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.&#13;
22.   The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least&#13;
possible disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.&#13;
23.   The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one&#13;
location as soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially&#13;
completed earthworks, especially during the rainy season.&#13;
24.   In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings,&#13;
cut off drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted&#13;
with grass or other plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize&#13;
water runoff and slope erosion.&#13;
25.   Any excavated cut or unsuitable material shall be disposed of in designated tipping areas&#13;
as agreed to by the Engineer.&#13;
26.   Tips should not be located where they can cause future slides, interfere with agricultural&#13;
land or any other properties, or cause soil from the dump to be washed into any watercourse.&#13;
Drains may need to be dug within and around the tips, as directed by the Engineer.&#13;
VI.   Historical and Archeological Sites&#13;
27.   If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects,&#13;
including graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor&#13;
shall:&#13;
(a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find.&#13;
(b) Delineate the discovered site or area.&#13;
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of&#13;
removable antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the&#13;
responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over.&#13;
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture immediately (less than 24 hours).&#13;
(e) Contact the responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture who would be in&#13;
charge of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on the proper procedures&#13;
to be carried out. This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be&#13;
performed by the archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The&#13;
significance and importance of the findings should be assessed according to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
various criteria relevant to cultural heritage, including the aesthetic, historic, scientific&#13;
or research, social and economic values.&#13;
(f) Ensure that decisions on how to handle the finding be taken by the responsible&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such&#13;
as when the finding is an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance)&#13;
conservation, preservation, restoration and salvage.&#13;
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding&#13;
shall be communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and&#13;
(h) Construction work will resume only after authorization is given by the responsible&#13;
local authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning the safeguard of the heritage.&#13;
VII.  Disposal of Construction and Vehicle Waste&#13;
28.   Debris generated due to the dismantling of the existing structures shall be suitably reused,&#13;
to the extent feasible, in the proposed construction (e.g., as fill materials for embankments). The&#13;
disposal of remaining debris shall be carried out only at sites identified and approved by the&#13;
project engineer. The contractor should ensure that these sites (a) are not located within&#13;
designated forest areas; (b) do not impact natural drainage courses; and (c) do not impact&#13;
endangered/rare flora. Under no circumstances shall the contractor dispose of any material in&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
29.   In the event any debris or silt from the sites is deposited on adjacent land, the Contractor&#13;
shall immediately remove such, debris or silt and restore the affected area to its original state to&#13;
the satisfaction of the Supervisor/Engineer.&#13;
30.   Bentonite slurry or similar debris generated from pile driving or other construction&#13;
activities shall be disposed of to avoid overflow into the surface water bodies or form mud&#13;
puddles in the area.&#13;
31.   All arrangements   for transportation  during  construction  including  provision,&#13;
maintenance, dismantling and clearing debris, where necessary, will be considered incidental to&#13;
the work and should be planned and implemented by the contractor as approved and directed by&#13;
the Engineer.&#13;
32.   Vehicle/machinery and equipment operations, maintenance and refueling shall be carried&#13;
out to avoid spillage of fuels and lubricants and ground contamination. An "oil interceptor" will&#13;
be provided for wash down and refueling areas. Fuel storage shall be located in proper bunded&#13;
areas.&#13;
33.   All spills and collected petroleum products shall be disposed of in accordance with&#13;
standard environmental procedures/guidelines. Fuel storage and refilling areas shall be located at&#13;

Selection of Priority Emergency Unit Buildings for Rehabilitation&#13;
The process for selection of the priority Emergency Unit Buildings for rehabilitation under the&#13;
project mainly has followed the guidelines earlier presented in the "Criteria for Selecting Priority&#13;
Hospital Facilities for Rehabilitation" (see below). The MOH established a list of priority&#13;
Emergency Units with balanced geographical spread over the country. The selected twelve&#13;
Emergency Units are located in nine different govemorates of Iraq. Four units are located in&#13;
Baghdad with a good spread to different areas of the city. The remaining eight units are&#13;
distributed to the following regions/cities: Dyala/Baquba, Kirkuk, Missan/Amara City, Karbala,&#13;
Anbar/Ramadi City, Salah Deen/Samara City, Erbil, and Sulaimanyiah.&#13;
Some important govemorates have been excluded from the list of priority Emergency Units&#13;
mainly because of the activities of other donors, for example, the Nasiriyah area (Italian funding)&#13;
and the Basra area (British funding). The rehabilitation of 15 hospitals, constructed in 1986 by&#13;
the Japanese Contractor Marubeni, may receive Japanese funding, according to preliminary&#13;
information.&#13;
The twelve Emergency Units are related to hospitals with an average capacity of 360 beds. Five&#13;
of the hospitals are teaching hospitals and seven are general hospitals. The largest hospital&#13;
included in the list of priority Emergency Units is the 660 bed Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital in&#13;
Baghdad City. The most extensive rehabilitation works also are proposed in this hospital, i.e.,&#13;
full rehabilitation of 2000 m2 at an estimated construction cost of US$1.4 million. The average&#13;
area of all twelve Emergency Units proposed for rehabilitation is 700 m2 and the average&#13;
construction cost US$540,000.&#13;
In all hospitals, except for the Al-Yarmook Teaching Hospital, new extensions are proposed to&#13;
the existing Emergency Unit Buildings. The average area of the extensions is 310 m2 and the&#13;
average construction cost US$300.000. The total average area of the rehabilitation and extension&#13;
works for all twelve Emergency Units is 1020 m2 and the average total construction cost is&#13;
US$840,000.&#13;
The selection of the priority Emergency Units seems to be thoroughly well-founded and&#13;
motivated, although this could not be confirmed by the mission as the background material for&#13;
the selection and evaluation process has not yet been compiled into an evaluation report. The&#13;
PMT was requested to present an evaluation report in condensed form based on the selection&#13;
criteria mentioned above. The evaluation report would be an excellent tool for increasing the&#13;
understanding of the rehabilitation project among Iraqi officials and Bank staff not directly&#13;
involved in the project appraisal process.&#13;
Criteria for Selecting Priority Hospital Facilities for Rehabilitation&#13;
Priority hospital services, such as emergency units, emergency obstetric services, critical care&#13;
services (operation departments, ICU, CCU, acute radiology, etc.) and support services (central&#13;
sterilization departments, laboratories, etc.) will be partly or fully rehabilitated and equipped in&#13;
12 carefully selected hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
The following essential data were required for the selection of priority hospital services and for&#13;
finalization of the list of priority projects:&#13;
*  The present and future role of the facility in the medical structure of Iraq, with regard to&#13;
medical services, medical training and location;&#13;
*  Size of the population served (the community's dependence on the facility based on patient&#13;
origin information and percentage of users from the community that go to the specific&#13;
facility);&#13;
*  Other similar medical services offered within the same catchment area (duplication with&#13;
other donors/other medical providers within the catchment area);&#13;
*  Accessibility for patients, ambulances and other emergency vehicles (strategic location in the&#13;
region/catchments area, location in the traffic/road network, intensity of traffic on access&#13;
roads, risks for traffic congestions, quality of public transports, etc.);&#13;
*  Present and planned medical production/utilization (number of outpatient visits to each&#13;
clinical service including emergency cases and utilization of the health institution's ancillary&#13;
and adjunct services; number of radiology examinations, laboratory analyses, deliveries and&#13;
operations in different specialties; number of beds, planned and acute admissions, average&#13;
length of stay and occupancy rate in each clinical service including recovery and post-&#13;
operative beds, ICU, CCU, etc.);&#13;
*  Number of staff per category;&#13;
*  Year of construction and current functional and technical condition of buildings (including&#13;
technical supply systems for water, sewage, electricity, telecommunication, heating, air-&#13;
condition, medical gases, etc.) and of major medical equipment and hospital information&#13;
systems;&#13;
*  Total site area of the hospital in hectares (size of available land);&#13;
*  Total gross floor area (total area of all floor levels between outer faces of containing walls) of&#13;
the facility as a whole and of each separate building;&#13;
*  Net floor area of each principal unit of the hospital which is proposed for rehabilitation or&#13;
upgrading (floor area calculated to the interior of containing walls including partitions and&#13;
corridors within a department, etc.);&#13;
*  Current plans for rehabilitating and/or upgrading facilities and medical equipment (including&#13;
city maps, site plans, floor plans, and photos showing the present situation);&#13;
*  Preliminary cost estimates of the proposed works and of other planned measures (purchasing&#13;
of medical equipment, etc).&#13;
Example of qualifying criteria for a given facility:&#13;
*  It is evident that the facility will play an important role in the future medical structure of Iraq;&#13;
*  The facility is of crucial importance within a heavily populated catchment area;&#13;
*  The facility is the sole important source of medical emergency services within the catchment&#13;
area;&#13;
*  The accessibility to the facility via public transport and the traffic/road network is greater&#13;
than for other equivalent facilities within the same catchment area;&#13;
*  The health institution offers (or can easily be upgraded to offer) a complete range of medical&#13;
emergency services, i.e., a functioning accident and emergency unit with close and quick&#13;
access to diagnostic facilities (emergency radiology and laboratory services, etc.) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
treatment/critical care facilities (operation theatres, ICU, CCU, etc.) as well as close access to&#13;
observation beds, emergency assessment beds, and post acute beds;&#13;
* The staffing is well-balanced (or can easily be upgraded to well-balanced) against the&#13;
planned future medical capacity of the health institution;&#13;
* The current functional and technical condition of the building meets minimum standards for&#13;
justifying major investments and will extend the life of the facility by an additional 15-20&#13;
years;&#13;
* The land available for the facility will permit future extensions of the medical services over&#13;
a period of 15-20 years;&#13;
* The capacity and the total gross floor area of the health institution is sufficient for the&#13;
planned rehabilitation and/or upgrading of the medical services without costly new buildings;&#13;
* The current plans for rehabilitation and upgrading of the facilities and medical equipment can&#13;
be realized within the budget available for the facility.&#13;
