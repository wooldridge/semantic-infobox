                                       I. BACKGROUND&#13;
 The SecondPrivate Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL 11) was designed to build on andcomplement&#13;
the financial and enterprise sector reforms already undertaken by the Government, supported by&#13;
the World Bank andthe first Private Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL I). loanpursued five key&#13;
                                                                           The&#13;
development objectives:&#13;
            the exit o fpublic banks from government ownership through privatization and other&#13;
            options acceptable to the Bank, accompanied by measuresto strengthen the overall&#13;
            environment for private sector banking and financial sector modernization;&#13;
            divestiture of the largest public sector industrial and commercial loss-makers from the&#13;
            government portfolio. This divestiturewas accompanied by other measures to&#13;
            complete privatizationo f pools o f enterprises andjoint ventures, to ensure the&#13;
            privatization procedures are transparent, fair and properly scrutinized so that the&#13;
            residual effects o f privatizationdo not serve as an obstacle to future privatization&#13;
            transactions;&#13;
            reform of the energy sector to introduce modem management principles and sound&#13;
            regulationto ensure that utility companies (e.g., electricity and gas) are not used as&#13;
            sources of cross-subsidization and soft credit (through arrears) that forestalls needed&#13;
            restructuring of enterprises. This reforni will be accompanied by the adoption of the&#13;
            necessary legal and regulatory framework for private sector participation, increasing&#13;
            prices towards cost recovery levels, ensuring consistency and transparency in tariff&#13;
            structures, and increasing collections for sustainable operations, needed reinvestment,&#13;
            and higher quality services delivery;&#13;
            strengthening of the business environment by the removal o f the administrative&#13;
            barriers that impede investment and trade, the removal of the most special hnds for&#13;
            fiscal consolidation and transparency, and a strengthening o f accounting, governance&#13;
            and bankruptcy standards and practices for a more competitive private sector-oriented&#13;
            economy; and&#13;
            provision o fmeaningfid social protection for those displaced by restructuringand&#13;
            privatization and strengthening the effectiveness o f the social safety net inthe long&#13;
            term.&#13;
                       11.     RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
Romania is pursuinga broad reform agenda, including economic, institutionaland governance&#13;
reforms, anchored inthe process o f EU accession. As a result, growth has been re-established&#13;
with GDP growth of4.9 percent in2003, ledprimarily by investment and exports. Inflationhas&#13;
also declined from 40 percent in2000 and 22.5 percent in2002 to 15.3 percent (CPI, period&#13;
average) in2003. Good macroeconomic performance contributedto reach a record level of&#13;
official reserves of over US$7 billion in2003 -an impressive increase o f US$3.5 billion since&#13;
2000. However, there has been a markeddeterioration of the current account deficit to 5.9&#13;
percent of GDP in2003 from 3.4 percent in 2003 fuelled in part by expansion o fbank credit to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 the private sector, which grew by about 45 percent inreal terms (largely consumer credit and&#13;
 mortgages) and by the effects o f earlier increases inwages.&#13;
&#13;
 FDIincreased slightly in2003, hovering around the last three years' averageand financing46&#13;
 percent of the current account gap. The fiscal deficit is at a relatively manageable level of 2.3&#13;
 percent of GDP, down from 4.0 percent in2000. Public sector debt at the end o f 2003 was 26.2&#13;
 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
 Quasi fiscal deficits remain highhowever, stemming from arrears and non-payment inthe SOE&#13;
 sector. Problems are most persistent inthe energy sector, particularly district heating. Quasi&#13;
 fiscal deficits and implicit subsidies are also prevalent inthe miningand railway sectors where&#13;
 non-payment to pensions and social funds are common.&#13;
&#13;
 The banking sector is on firmer footing and direct lendingby the central bank has been&#13;
 eliminated. Incontrast to the past, privatization seems to be picking up momentumas well as&#13;
restructuring of the railway and mining sectors. Progress in stabilizationand growth contributed&#13;
to a decline inpoverty to 29 percent in 2002.&#13;
&#13;
IMFProgram:The IMFsuccessfully completed its fifth Stand-By Agreement (SBA) with&#13;
Romaniain October last year and is preparing a Precautionary SBA which i s likely to be o f 24&#13;
months duration. Two missions have been conducted for this new SBA. Agreement was not&#13;
reached on the program at that time. However, duringthe Springmeetings an understanding was&#13;
reached on a fiscal deficit o f 2.1 percent of GDP (or less ifrevenue outturn is larger than&#13;
currently projected). This was the only outstanding issue, and subject to management approval o f&#13;
the deficit target, the SBA is tentatively plannedto go to Board June 30,2004. Reflecting its&#13;
concern about the size of quasi-fiscal deficits, the Fundis insistingthat all investment spending,&#13;
including the large plannedroadprojects be kept on budgetregardless o f the financing&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
The new SBA is likely to continue the themes of the previous program with an emphasis on&#13;
maintainingmacro stability, reducinginflation, limitingincreases inthe public sector wage bill and&#13;
the minimum wage, and pursuing privatizations. In addition, it will likely call for initiation of&#13;
bankruptcy proceedings against non-payers of taxes, layoffs in the mining sector, and the closure&#13;
of inefficient district heating operations.&#13;
A significant portion o f the structural agenda for the Fund has been worked out in close&#13;
consultation with the Bank and a growing portion of the correspondence with the authorities on&#13;
specific issues has been issued jointly by the Bank and the Fund, (for example, related to&#13;
privatization of CEC Savings Bank, reform o f the labor code, and development o f the mining&#13;
sector reform strategy). Ina new development for the Fund's program, governance issues are being&#13;
directly addressed in the Letter of Intent. This has been done with consultation with the Bank and&#13;
echoes closely the content of the PAL program. Managed well, this intensive collaboration and&#13;
reinforcing conditionality provides greater impetus for the success of both Bank and Fund&#13;
programs and for the overall reformprocess.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, the Bank considers the macroeconomic situation and policy framework in Romania&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;

restructuring of Termoelectrica, this addresses the privatization of two of its four subsidiaries. The&#13;
processwas launched and is supportedby the PALprogram.&#13;
A similar restructuring and partial privatization will be carried out for Hidroelectrica (the main&#13;
hydropower generator). The timing of the privatization will be linked to the development of the&#13;
electricity market, for which the Bank is providing support under the ongoing Electricity Market&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8. The Borrower had submitted satisfactory evidence to the Bank that the cumulative&#13;
year-to-date rate of collection for payments to Distrigaz Sud and Distrigaz Nord has&#13;
reached ninety-seven and a half percent (97.5 percent) o f the total billings, and that the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
 accounts payable to the gas producers and gas transmission companies, resulting from gas&#13;
 delivery, will be paid within sixty (60) days, commencing on January 1,2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Status: Condition has beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Collections are subject to monthly monitoring. By end-April2004, the cumulative year-to-date&#13;
 rate (January -April 2004) of collection for payments to Distrigaz Sud and DistrigazNordwas&#13;
 about 105 percent o f the total billings. To eliminate seasonalvariations, collection performance&#13;
 i s also assessed on a 12-month rolling basis. The collection rate on a 12-monthrollingbasis (May&#13;
 2003 -April 2004) was about 100percent of 12-month billings. The company-by-company&#13;
 breakdown o fyear-to-date (and 12-month) collection rates as o f end-April2004 was as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                 Distrigaz Sud - 104.8 percent (12-month rate 101.9 percent)&#13;
             0   Distrigaz Nord- 105.4 percent (12-month rate 98.1 percent)&#13;
&#13;

delivery, was paidwithin 55 days o f sales, commencing on January 1,2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9. The Borrower has submitted satisfactory evidence to the Bank that: (a) the cumulative&#13;
monthly rate of collection for payments to Electrica has reached at least ninety-seven and a&#13;
half percent (97.5 percent) of the total billings for the period commencing from January 1,&#13;
2002; (b) the monthly rate of collection for payments to Termoelectrica has reached one&#13;
hundred percent (100 percent) of the total electricity billings for each month commencing&#13;
from October 1,2001; and (c) the cumulative monthly rate of collection for payments to&#13;
Termoelectrica for district heating supplies has reached at least ninety-seven and a half&#13;
percent (97.5 percent) of the total billings for the period commencing from January 1,&#13;
2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Jb) Status: Condition hasbeen substantially met.&#13;
lc) Status: Condition has been substantially met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Collections are subject to monthly monitoring. The primary performance measure is a 12-month&#13;
rolling average to smoothen the impact of seasonal variations. The achievements at end-April&#13;
2004 were:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Electrica- 99.0 percent (99.6 percent inApril 2004)&#13;
     0   Termoelectrica for electricity - 97.0 percent (144.6 percent inApril 2004)&#13;
     0   Termoelectrica for district heat - 95.3 percent (185.9 percent inApril 2004)&#13;
(a) Electrica collections - collections from electricity consumers. In 2003 Electrica achieved&#13;
98.0 percent collection level, meeting the agreed 97.5 percent target. From May 2003 until April&#13;
2004, the collection rate was slightly higher at 99.0 percent. While these are highly satisfactory&#13;
collection rates, challenges remain in collections from some state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -6-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 government agencies. The Government has acknowledged it is ultimately responsible for these&#13;
 non-payments, and in May 2004 approved an Ordinance under which it undertakes to make&#13;
 payments from the budget in cases where utilities are obliged to continue to supply defaulting&#13;
 state-owned enterprises and other government agencies. It is expected that this explicit&#13;
 commitment will help ensure that non-payment in the electricity sector remains under control. Bill&#13;
 collection from non-government consumers is satisfactory and will remainthe responsibility of the&#13;
 utilities without budgetary back-stopping.&#13;
 Duringthe gas and electricity distributionprivatizationprocesses, the Government tried to pass on&#13;
 SOE and other govemment agency arrears to the new private owner. Prospective investors,&#13;
 however, regard the arrears to be uncollectible, and agreements were negotiated under which such&#13;
 arrears are replacedby long-term govemment bonds. These arrangements reflect the Government's&#13;
 acknowledgement that it is responsible for these arrears. The same approach is expected to be&#13;
 followed inthe future electricity discom privatizations - includingthe privatization of the other six&#13;
 discoms included inthe PALprogram.&#13;
 (b) Termoelectrica's collections - for bulk electricity supply. The agreed target of 100percent&#13;
 collection has proven to be optimistic. Termoelectrica's collections at 97 percent closely reflect&#13;
 those of Electrica's. Termoelectrica collected 93.1 percent of its bill from Electrica and another 4&#13;
 percent through a system of offsets. Instead o f the Government paying Electrica for governmental&#13;
 electricity consumption, Electrica paying Termoelectrica, and Termoelectrica paying taxes, the&#13;
 Government and Termoelectrica offset these liabilities (i.e., govemment payments for electricity&#13;
 consumption and Termoelectrica's tax payments to the Govemment were offset). In view o f&#13;
 Electrica's collection accomplishments and Termoelectrica' s achievement of collections at 97&#13;
percent, the condition is considered substantially met.&#13;
 (c) Termoelectrica's collections - for bulk heat supply. The agreed target of 97.5 percent&#13;
collections has proven to be optimistic given the poor financial and operational condition o f most&#13;
of Termoelectrica's bulk heat clients - district heating utilities selling heat to final consumers,&#13;
mostly households. Termoelectrica has however been able to improve its collections substantially&#13;
to 95.3 percent through a combination of measures: (i)intensifiedpressure on the clients, and (ii)&#13;
by transferring a number of its smaller district heating facilities to the local authorities which are&#13;
then also directlyinchargeoftheir heatproduction, inaddition its distribution.&#13;
&#13;
After having restructured electricity and gas sectors, the Government is now launching a program&#13;
to restructure the district heating sector. Romania has an extensive district heating system, which&#13;
even after some consolidation covers 179 cities. Many o f the systems are under great operational&#13;
and financial stress, but the continued provision of heating is an essential service. While tariffs&#13;
have been adjusted, they have not kept up with increasing costs. The Government at both the&#13;
central and local levels has responded by increasing subsidies, both to heat producers and to heat&#13;
consumers. As a result, the annual subsidy burden now exceeds US$350 million and has become&#13;
a major fiscal issue.&#13;
&#13;
The Government has prepared with Bank and EU support a strategy for the restructuring of the&#13;
district heating sector that aims to address the sector's most chronic operational and financial&#13;
issues. The strategy covers pricing, subsidies, and restructuring and rehabilitation o f heat&#13;
production, heat distribution and heat consumption, including heat metering and heat control&#13;
measures. Difficult decisions including politically sensitive pricing and subsidy issues will then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 -7-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 have to be addressed during the implementation of the strategy. Government approval o f the&#13;
 strategy was a condition of the first installment ofthe PALprogram. The proposed PAL2 (FY06)&#13;
 and PAL3 (FY07) will support the implementation o f the strategy. It is also proposed that, in&#13;
 parallel with the P A Lprogram, the Bank provide investment financing for the implementationo f&#13;
 key actions of the strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 The restructuring o f the district heating sector will be a major challenge in Romania. Thus, the&#13;
 satisfactory and sustainable resolution o f Tennoelectrica's district heat collections issues will not&#13;
 be possible until the program has made considerable progress. In view o f the Government's&#13;
 commitment to such restructuring and its interim actions which have brought collections to 95.3&#13;
 percent (a highlycommendable level given the condition of the clients), the condition is considered&#13;
 substantially met.&#13;
&#13;
 Social Protection System&#13;
&#13;
 10. The Borrower has (a) submitted satisfactory evidence that sufficient portion within the&#13;
 Borrower's budget is allocated to finance the MinimumGuaranteed Income Program: and&#13;
 (b) enacted a Law on the National Social Assistance System and enabling legislation,&#13;
 satisfactory to the B a n k&#13;
&#13;
 Status: Condition has been met.&#13;
&#13;
 For each of the last three years, the budget allocation for the MIGprogram amounted to 0.4&#13;
percent of the GDP, as agreed with the Bank and the IMF. Through the Law approvingthe 2003&#13;
budget, it provided Lei 6,867.7 billion, out of which Lei 5,495.4 billion was from the state&#13;
budget and Lei 1,372.3 billion from the local budgets.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, the Parliament hasenactedthe Law 705/2001 on the National SocialAssistance&#13;
Systemand Ordinance 68/2003 on Social Assistance Services, satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11. The Borrower has enacted legislation, acceptable to the Bank, to strengthen the&#13;
financial viability and to rationalize the structure and financing mechanism for&#13;
unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Status: Condition has beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
The Law 76/2002 regarding the unemployment insurance and employment incentives has been&#13;
enacted and promotes a system of measures stimulating employment and ensuring the financial&#13;
viability of the unemployment insurance budget. Inthis way, the Government Decision 377/2002&#13;
approved the procedures regarding the access to the employment incentives, financing means&#13;
and instructions for their implementation. Through the Law 76/2002 the unique level o f the&#13;
unemployment indemnity was established to 75 percent of the country gross minimum wage in&#13;
the case ofunemployedpersons, and respectively to 50 percent inthe case o f graduatesnotbeing&#13;
able to be employed. Thus, the discrepancies in the system of setting up the unemployment&#13;
indemnity were eliminated and the indemnities were correlated with the level of the minimum&#13;
wage. As a result, the Unemployment Fundhas       rzl~l&#13;
                                                      a budget surplus for the last three years.&#13;

            Romania - Second Private Sector Adjustment
            Loan Project : Release of Second Tranche - Full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Second Private Sector Adjustment
            Loan Project was designed to build on, and complement the
            financial, and enterprise sector reforms already undertaken
            by the Government, supported by the Bank and the first
            Private Sector Adjustment Loan Project. Recent economic
            developments show Romania is pursuing a broad reform agenda,
            including economic, institutional and governance reforms,
            anchored in the process of EU accession. However, there has
            been a marked deterioration of the current account deficit
            to in 2003, fuelled in part by the expansion of bank credit
            to the private sector. Foreign direct investment (FDI)
            increased slightly in 2003, while fiscal deficit is
            relatively manageable, although quasi fiscal deficits remain
            high. Overall, the Bank considers the macroeconomic
            situation, and policy framework in Romania satisfactory, and
            conditions for second tranche release have been met, or
            substantially met, in areas related to the financial sector,
            energy sector, privatization and social protection.
            Conditions substantially met demonstrate that a) the monthly
            rate of collection for payments to Termoelectrica reached
            one hundred percent of the total electricity billings for
            each month commencing October 1, 2001, and, b) the
            cumulative monthly rate of collection for payments to
            Termoelectrica for district heating supplies reached at
            least ninety-seven and a half percent of the total billings
            for the period commencing January 1, 2002. In view of the
            overall performance and progress with the implementation of
            the program supported by the Loan, and in compliance with
            specific release conditions of the Loan Agreement, the
            second tranche is available for release to the Borrower.
