        <abstracts>
            The author looks at the impact of the
            changes in the telecommunications industry on regulation. As
            demand changes, services converge, and new players emerge,
            the key issue for regulators is promoting competition. The
            work of regulators is becoming increasingly complex at the
            same time that convergence and the common principles
            established in regional and international trade agreements
            are reducing their discretion. One way for regulators to
            deal with the complexity is to privatize aspects of
            regulation-for example, by creating property rights to the
            spectrum and by outsourcing some regulatory tasks. But the
            specialized telecommunications regulatory agency is probably
            a transitory entity that may eventually find itself merged
            into a multisectoral antitrust agency.
