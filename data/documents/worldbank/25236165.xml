WBI Urban:&#13;
FY 10 Retrospective Review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Introduction&#13;
&#13;
  Urbanization is the defining phenomenon of the 21st century. For the first time in history, more&#13;
  than half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s population lives in cities with 90% of growth taking place in the&#13;
  developing world. Poverty is urbanizing. Across all developing regions, except ECA, urban&#13;
  poverty is growing. 70-75% of urban residents in Africa and South Asia are poor. In Latin&#13;
  America, more than half of the poor live in urban areas. Already over 1 billion, slum populations&#13;
  are expanding further.&#13;
&#13;
  While urbanization presents many challenges, it provides tremendous economic opportunities.&#13;
  Majority of wealth is created in cities as they account for around 70 percent of global GDP. The&#13;
  old paradigm views urbanization as being too rapid and that primary cities are too large.&#13;
  However, a consensus is emerging towards a new paradigm: urbanization is not just inevitable&#13;
  but essential to economic growth, prosperity, and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
  In response to the challenges and&#13;
  opportunities brought about by this&#13;
  centuryâ&#128;&#153;s unprecedented pace and scale of&#13;
  urbanization, WBI Urban provides city&#13;
  managers and practitioners with&#13;
  knowledge and skills to effectively handle&#13;
  this phenomenon. In FY10, building on&#13;
  past experience and successes but taking&#13;
  into account WBIâ&#128;&#153;s new paradigm, the&#13;
  team has continued to make available&#13;
  innovative solutions for effective and&#13;
  efficient city management to create&#13;
  economically vibrant, inclusive, and safe&#13;
  and resilient cities.&#13;
&#13;
  WBI Urban views itself as a critical player in the fulfillment of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s new Urban&#13;
  Strategy, launched last November 2009, through activities that are aligned with WBIâ&#128;&#153;s new&#13;
  direction as a global facilitator of capacity building and connector of knowledge, learning, and&#13;
  innovation. As a global connector, it has facilitated practitioner exchanges using various&#13;
  connectivity platforms complemented by a robust structured learning program covering various&#13;
  topics in urban management, including city management, slum upgrading, disaster risk&#13;
  management, and urban water utility reform. As a local enabler, it has undertaken in-depth&#13;
  country engagement to support the capacity building infrastructure for urban management in&#13;
  key countries, namely China, India, South Africa, and Vietnam.&#13;
&amp;#12;Practitioner Exchange&#13;
&#13;
FY 10 saw the launch of WBI Urbanâ&#128;&#153;s premier interactive platform aimed at connecting cities&#13;
from developing and developed countries together with the private sector, civil society and&#13;
other stakeholders. The "Innovative Cities Global Dialogues" features a continuously&#13;
expanding network of policymakers and practitioners backed by a knowledge infrastructure that&#13;
will contain a wealth of useful practices and lessons for cities around the world. The platform&#13;
was launched in a June 22-23, 2010 symposium in Washington DC with the theme â&#128;&#156;Cities as&#13;
Engines of Economic Growth and Stimulants of Sub-national Investment Climate.â&#128;&#157; This dynamic&#13;
dialogue featured successful cities in both the developing and developed world with active&#13;
participation by the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Within the ambit of the Innovative Cities&#13;
                                                    platform, the team has been supporting&#13;
                                                    knowledge sharing activities among&#13;
                                                    geographic and theme-specific practitioner&#13;
                                                    networks. A key network is the inter-regional&#13;
                                                    India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Human&#13;
                                                    Settlements Network, one of the thematic&#13;
                                                    groups in the trilateral South-South&#13;
                                                    mechanism established by the three&#13;
                                                    countries. Further on the area of slum&#13;
                                                    upgrading, the team launched the Inclusive&#13;
                                                    Cities interactive community of practitioners&#13;
collaboration website, a peer learning and knowledge platform for slum upgrading and&#13;
affordable housing. WBI Urban has also developed a Crime and Violence Prevention&#13;
Knowledge Exchange Platform between Latin America and Africa, launched through a&#13;
knowledge sharing dialogue on Youth Crime and Violence Prevention on May 21, 2010 which&#13;
linked practitioners in Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua, and South Africa. This platform aims to&#13;
strengthen capacities of key stakeholders through interactive engagement with thought leaders&#13;
and experts. In Africa, a key priority of the World Bank, WBI Urban has been helping&#13;
Anglophone and Francophone local action government forums by providing a venue where&#13;
policymakers and key officials can exchange ideas and best practices through monthly thematic&#13;
seminars covering the various topics of city management.&#13;
&#13;
The team has also actively participated in global and regional high-level events, including the&#13;
Africities Summit (December 2009) and World Urban Forum V (March 2010) to showcase its&#13;
products, as well as further pursue its programs in the international stage. For WUF V, WBI&#13;
Urban organized a training session entitled â&#128;&#156;Working to Improve the Competitiveness of&#13;
Cities in the Global &amp; Regional Market.â&#128;&#157; The team will be participating in the ongoing World&#13;
Expo 2010 in Shanghai by co-organizing a thematic forum on Economic Transformation and&#13;
Urban Rural Relations from September 9 to 12, 2010 in nearby Shaoxing municipality featuring&#13;
a roundtable among local leaders from 12 small cities on issues of urbanization and economic&#13;
development.&#13;

Structured Learning&#13;
&#13;
In FY10, WBI Urban rolled out new courses and continued delivery of existing structured&#13;
learning modules. While continuing to collaborate with institutional partners in the regions for&#13;
customization and delivery, the team has increasingly shifted its attention towards the creation&#13;
of a catalogue of e-learning courses for self-paced learning and to scale up dissemination and&#13;
accessibility of knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Our learning products are tailored to the needs of various audiences, particularly policymakers&#13;
and technical staff and other concerned practitioners. To improve the leadership skills of&#13;
mayors and city officials, WBI Urban is currently developing a learning program entitled â&#128;&#156;Cities&#13;
as Engines of Economic Growth.â&#128;&#157; This program is designed to provide practical guidance to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â                                                                Â &#13;

&amp;#12;mayors on measures to promote sustained economic growth and productivity. In addition, the&#13;
team is developing a leadership program with WBI Governance and Lee Kwan Yew School to&#13;
better implement urban development strategies through effective leadership and&#13;
governance.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of the various technical&#13;
elements of city management, in FY 10,&#13;
WBI Urban initiated the delivery of two&#13;
new courses â&#128;&#147; Land Use Planning&#13;
(June 2010) and â&#128;&#156;Street Addressing&#13;
and the Management of Citiesâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
(November-December 2009 and April-&#13;
June 2010). The latter has been&#13;
translated into different languages for&#13;
greater accessibility and will be&#13;
available in English, French, and&#13;
Spanish beginning FY 11. Delivery will&#13;
be undertaken through WBIâ&#128;&#153;s regional&#13;
partners (TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey or&#13;
Monterrey Tech for the Spanish version&#13;
and University of Johannesburg for&#13;
English). Also in collaboration with Monterrey Tech, WBI Urban continued rolling out the Crime&#13;
and Violence Prevention course (last cycle held from March to June 2010). The program is&#13;
currently available in Spanish to cater especially to the Latin American region but is now being&#13;
developed in English and updated and appropriately contextualized for audiences in the&#13;
Caribbean and Africa.&#13;
&#13;
WBI Urban puts emphasis on inclusive pro-poor urban development. Towards this end, a core&#13;
learning program on Upgrading Informal Settlements is being developed, covering the basic&#13;
conceptual and operational aspects of how to design and manage a slum upgrading&#13;
intervention, while reviewing key issues related to the policy and programmatic approaches for&#13;
scaling up and anticipating future urban growth. This builds on previous materials developed by&#13;
the World Bank and Cities Alliance, such as a multimedia sourcebook on Approaches to Urban&#13;
Slums which has been made available online and has been adapted in Spanish.&#13;
&#13;
And because of the relevance of the climate change agenda in the urban context with cities&#13;
accounting for majority of greenhouse gas emissions and the urban poorâ&#128;&#153;s particular&#13;
vulnerability to the impact of climate change, WBI Urban team has begun collaborating with the&#13;
WBI Climate Change Practice and FEU to develop learning products on cities and climate&#13;
change and urban poverty and climate change.&#13;
&#13;
To ensure that the poor as well as the general population have access to urban services,&#13;
especially water, WBI Urban has developed a course which aims to enable participants,&#13;
especially CEOs, to review and experience the water supply and sanitation utility reform&#13;
process by understanding the political economy of the sector, understanding consumers, and&#13;
creating and selling a financial and institutional strategy for sustaining utility performance. The&#13;
course was piloted as a face-to-face course in February 2010 in Uganda involving senior&#13;
managers from water utilities throughout the African region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                          http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about/topics/urban Â &#13;
&amp;#12;In addition, given the relevance of disaster risk adaption and mitigation, WBI Urban has&#13;
continued the delivery of its 9 Disaster Risk Management (DRM) e-learning courses&#13;
(Comprehensive DRM framework, Financial strategies for managing the economic impacts of&#13;
natural disasters, Safe cities, Community based DRM, Damage and reconstruction needs&#13;
assessment, Earthquake risk reduction, Climate and disaster risk management, and Risk&#13;
sensitive land use planning, and Gender aspects of disaster risk reduction) and has finalized a&#13;
new course on Risk Analysis. The latest DRM program was piloted in February 2010.&#13;

&amp;#12;In India, in partnership with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
South Asia Sustainable Development Unit&#13;
and Cities Alliance, WBI has developed a&#13;
joint program to support the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
national urban policy reforms. The main&#13;
objective is to help all tiers of government&#13;
in India to manage the urban space and&#13;
prepare for the massive shift to&#13;
urbanization, which will take place over the&#13;
coming decades. WBI support has two&#13;
dimensions at the national level: assisting&#13;
high-level policy makers to advance policy&#13;
reforms by facilitating knowledge&#13;
exchange platforms built on South-South&#13;
cooperation; and supporting the&#13;
emergence of a national institutional architecture for capacity development.&#13;
&#13;
In South Africa, WBI has been helping to strengthen the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s National Upgrading&#13;
Support Programme (NUSP) by assisting the National Department of Human Settlements in the&#13;
establishment, organization, and functioning of a coordination unit in charge of implementing&#13;
the NUSP.&#13;
&#13;
In Vietnam, WBI Urban has been providing support to the Academy of Management for Cities&#13;
to develop a national capacity building program on urban management for mayors and vice-&#13;
mayors. To launch this program, a pilot conference on competitiveness for 35 Vietnamese cities&#13;
was held from December 14-18, 2009 which included lecture sessions from international experts&#13;
and a study tour to Incheon, South Korea.&#13;
&#13;
Aside from its current portfolio, WBI Urban has been actively seeking to expand its reach to&#13;
cover other regions and countries. The team is currently engaging with the Austrian&#13;
government to establish a Center of Excellence within the Joint Vienna Institute to train city&#13;
mayors and host knowledge exchange events to cover selected Eastern Europe countries.&#13;

            Urbanization is the defining phenomenon
            of the 21st century. For the first time in history, more
            than half of the world’s population lives in cities with 90
            percent of growth taking place in the developing world.
            Poverty is urbanizing. Across all developing regions, except
            ECA, urban poverty is growing. 70-75 percent of urban
            residents in Africa and South Asia are poor. In Latin
            America, more than half of the poor live in urban areas.
            Already over 1 billion, slum populations are expanding
            further. While urbanization presents many challenges, it
            provides tremendous economic opportunities. Majority of
            wealth is created in cities as they account for around 70
            percent of global GDP. The old paradigm views urbanization
            as being too rapid and those primary cities are too large.
            However, a consensus is emerging towards a new paradigm:
            urbanization is not just inevitable but essential to
            economic growth, prosperity, and poverty reduction. WBI
            Urban views itself as a critical player in the fulfillment
            of the World Bank Group’s new urban strategy, launched last
            November 2009, through activities that are aligned with
            WBI’s new direction as a global facilitator of capacity
            building and connector of knowledge, learning, and
            innovation. As a global connector, it has facilitated
            practitioner exchanges using various connectivity platforms
            complemented by a robust structured learning program
            covering various topics in urban management, including city
            management, slum upgrading, disaster risk management, and
            urban water utility reform. As a local enabler, it has
            undertaken in-depth country engagement to support the
            capacity building infrastructure for urban management in key
            countries, namely China, India, South Africa, and Vietnam.
