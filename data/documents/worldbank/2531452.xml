             Reviving the Market for Corporate&#13;
             Control&#13;
&#13;
Chad Leechor   Changes in corporate control--through mergers, takeovers, acquisitions, divestitures, and the&#13;
&#13;
               like--enhance shareholders' value. They allow the businesses to be transferred to the control of&#13;
&#13;
               new owners who can put business assets to work more efficiently. In most countries, however,&#13;
&#13;
               the market for corporate control is significantly restricted by anti-takeover laws and business&#13;
&#13;
               practices used to entrench management, such as poison pills, heavy debt, pyramid schemes, and&#13;
&#13;
               cross-holdings of equity. The key to overcoming these obstacles is to restructure incentives--by&#13;
&#13;
               requiring business groups to disclose intercorporate ownership and banks to limit connected&#13;
&#13;
               lending, by ensuring that bankruptcy law allows effective transfer of control, and by removing&#13;
&#13;
               regulatory barriers to takeovers.&#13;

            Reviving the market for corporate control
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Changes in corporate control-through
            mergers, takeovers, acquisitions, divestitures, and the
            like-enhance shareholders' value. They allow the
            businesses to be transferred to the control of new owners
            who can put business assets to work more efficiently. In
            most countries, however, the market for corporate control is
            significantly restricted by anti-takeover laws and business
            practices used to entrench management, such as poison pills,
            heavy debt, pyramid schemes, and cross-holdings of equity.
            The key to overcoming these obstacles is to restructure
            incentives-by requiring business groups to disclose
            intercorporate ownership and banks to limit connected
            lending, by ensuring that bankruptcy law allows effective
            transfer of control, and by removing regulatory barriers to
            takeovers. Many studies of mergers, takeovers, acquisitions,
            and divestitures have confirmed that these control
            transactions generally maximize shareholders' value
            (Jensen and Ruback 1983). The gain in value is most visible
            in target firms' stock prices following announcements
            of takeover attempts or merger agreements. Even in the most
            advanced markets, where control transactions are common,
            stock prices increase 20 to 30 percent on average, depending
            on the type of transaction (Jarrell, Brickley, and Netter
            1988). This gain represents one part of the increased
            business value that the acquirer is prepared to share with
            the target firm.
