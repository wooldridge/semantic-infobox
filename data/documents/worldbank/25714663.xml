results. However, the obligation to make&#13;

            Attracting capital for railway development
            in China
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            China Railways Corporation (CRC) is
            considering new ways to attract capital to support the
            strategic development of the railway sector. Currently,
            government is the predominant equity financier, with debt
            being supplied by domestic bank credits and limited amounts
            borrowed from International Financial Institutions such as
            the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Considering its
            high level of accumulated debt and liabilities (RMB 3.7
            trillion on an asset base of 5.7 trillion), CRC wishes to
            explore equity investment mechanisms, to increase cash flow
            from its core and non-core activities, and to use different
            financing channels as a way to leverage the value of its
            assets and introduce market-based business models to the
            sector.  CRC is seeking to attract investment from both the
            private sector and from public sources such as local
            governments and state owned enterprises. It refers to these
            sources of capital as ‘social capital.’  This report
            examines how companies in China and railways in seven other
            countries, China, France, India, Japan, Poland, Russia,
            United Kingdom, United States, have attracted capital and
            made capital budgeting decisions to support their strategic development.
