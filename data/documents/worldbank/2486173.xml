            Unsolicited proposals : the issues for
            private infrastructure projects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many of the world's most
            controversial private infrastructure projects originated as
            unsolicited proposals to governments. This Note explores
            critical questions for developing policies to deal with
            unsolicited proposals. For example, under what conditions
            should governments allow unsolicited proposals? And how can
            they add competition and transparency to the process? A
            companion Note reviews the methods used by the governments
            of Chile, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and South
            Africa to transform unsolicited proposals into competitively
            tendered projects.
