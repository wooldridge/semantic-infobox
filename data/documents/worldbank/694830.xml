Note No. 113   Colombia's Gradualist Approach to Private&#13;
Participation in Infrastructure&#13;
Pbilip Gray      Like the model adopted by many Asian countries, the Colombian approach to private participation in&#13;
infrastructure aims to attract project financing for new facilities, leaving most existing assets in state&#13;
hands. While the approach has been successful in attracting substantial private capital to Colombia, it&#13;
has been less successful in delivering the potential efficiency gains or the reforms that will ensure&#13;
that assets remain private and that private sector actions are constrained by a stable set of rules and&#13;
regulations. Recently, Colombia has moved toward the model adopted by other countries in Latin&#13;
America-privatizing existing assets-a policy likely to provide a more enduring basis for reform.&#13;
