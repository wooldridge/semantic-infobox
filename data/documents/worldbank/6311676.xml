The International Finance Corporation is the private sector&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
D.C. IFC coordinates its activities with the other institutions of the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank Group but is legally and financially independent. Its&#13;
&#13;
178 member countries provide its share capital and collectively&#13;

The mission of IFC is to promote sustainable private sector&#13;
&#13;
investment in developing and transition countries, helping to&#13;
&#13;
reduce poverty and improve people's lives. IFC finances private&#13;
&#13;
sector investments in the developing world, mobilizes capital in&#13;
&#13;
the international financial markets, helps clients improve social&#13;
&#13;
and environmental sustainability, and provides technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
and advice to governments and businesses. From its founding in&#13;
&#13;
1956 through FY05, IFC has committed more than $49 billion&#13;
&#13;
of its own funds and arranged $24 billion in syndications for&#13;

                                           This Annual Report records the achievements of the International Finance&#13;
                                           Corporation during the last year of the tenure of Executive Vice President&#13;
                                           Peter Woicke and my distinguished predecessor, World Bank President Jim&#13;
                                           Wolfensohn. It is an enormous responsibility to be entrusted with the leadership&#13;
                                           of this extraordinary institution, and I am grateful to Jim and Peter for having&#13;
                                           done so much to strengthen it.&#13;
                                               While much has been accomplished by the World Bank Group and its&#13;
   IFC's MISSION                           development partners, much remains to be done. The G-8 Summit at&#13;
&#13;
    To promote sustainable private         Gleneagles at the beginning of this new fiscal year has brought a welcome focus&#13;
                                           on the challenges of global development, particularly in Africa. It has also&#13;
    sector investment in developing        reaffirmed the central role of the World Bank in so much of that work and has&#13;
    countries, helping to reduce           given us even more to do.&#13;
    poverty and improve people's lives.        As we move forward, we need to keep a balance among the different development&#13;
                                           priorities. The first priority must be to pay special attention to the needs of the&#13;
                                           poorest people in the poorest countries in the world. At the same time, the&#13;
                                           World Bank still has an important role to play with the rapidly growing&#13;
                                           developing countries, the so-called "middle-income" countries that nevertheless&#13;
                                           still have hundreds of millions of people living in extreme poverty. Finally, as a&#13;
                                           multilateral development institution, the World Bank is uniquely positioned to&#13;
                                           help the world address some of the concerns of the "global commons," such as&#13;
                                           the development of sustainable energy and the alleviation of global health crises.&#13;
                                               For its part, IFC is at the forefront of private sector development--promoting&#13;
                                           sustainable private development to help reduce poverty and improve people's&#13;
                                           lives. It is an exciting mission, and across the spectrum of private enterprise--&#13;
                                           from critical, long-term infrastructure to small microfinance lending--&#13;
                                           encouraging progress continues.&#13;
                                               IFC's strong operating results and ever-increasing development impact are&#13;
                                           compelling arguments for an optimistic outlook for the developing world. And&#13;
                                           I am very optimistic. I see the work ahead of us, but in the energy, creativity,&#13;
                                           determination, diversity, and talent of the people, I also see the promise.&#13;
                                               In all of this work, the World Bank is blessed with an exceptionally dedicated&#13;

Message from&#13;
the Executive Vice President&#13;
&#13;
"The Year of Development"--as many in the international community have termed&#13;
2005--has been a rare moment in the long global debate about reducing poverty and&#13;
improving people's lives in the developing nations. Few times in recent years has there&#13;
been such a sustained airing of views about aid, development, and the degree of progress                                                             Overview&#13;
it is fair to expect. The focus on development is long overdue, of course. But as&#13;
important as the issues themselves has been the multiplicity of the voices taking part.&#13;
    No longer is the issue of global development finance the preserve and prerogative of&#13;
experts on development. It is a wide-open, wide-ranging debate that includes virtually&#13;
all nations, large and small. It includes the public and private sectors. And it includes&#13;
global advocates who campaign on behalf of a diverse array of economic, environmental,&#13;
and social issues.&#13;
    To a striking degree, these voices agree on many fundamental aspects of development.&#13;
Few, if any, have suggested that they will be untouched by the decisions made. Few have&#13;
argued that solutions can be transplanted from one nation to another without careful&#13;
attention to local conditions. Overwhelmingly, the role of the private sector is recognized&#13;
as pivotal, and most agree that one of the main challenges is to scale up the successful&#13;
approaches that have been tried. Improving governance and building capacity in both the&#13;
private and public sectors seem to be the starting point for every discussion. Strategically&#13;
speaking, "bottom-up" approaches are in; "top-down" are out. The watchwords:&#13;
discipline, measurement, and results.                                                                                            LITTLEHALES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Moreover, the idea that the developing nations are somehow a "third" world has&#13;
                                                                                                                                            BRETON&#13;

been relegated to the dustbin. The fate of these nations has become the political, moral,     Assaad J. Jabre&#13;
&#13;
economic, environmental, and social crossroads of our generation. Were one to list            Acting Executive Vice President&#13;
&#13;
the biggest global challenges in economics, energy, or the environment, nearly all of&#13;
them would be centered in the developing world. Wherever one may live, one's fate&#13;
will be linked in some way, large or small, directly or indirectly, to the course these&#13;
countries take.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All of this underscores what a great opportunity IFC now has as an institution focusing&#13;
on sustainable private sector development. For decades, our focus has been helping&#13;
nations grow and thrive from the bottom up--one investment, one business at a time.&#13;
This has also helped us catalyze investment and reform throughout markets and sectors,&#13;
creating interest in those at the frontiers of the emerging markets. Meanwhile, the&#13;
challenges we face in globalizing markets have continually forced us to innovate and&#13;
experiment, while refining our traditional products and services. The institutional&#13;
discipline that comes with being a risk-taking private investor has cultivated precisely&#13;
the kind of careful, tailor-made approach that is now so widely recognized for its&#13;

                                                  This year marks a third consecutive year of record results for IFC. As much as we&#13;

                                               so many emerging markets has made it possible, these results are overshadowed by a&#13;

                                               progress. Fulfilling our developmental mission will take more effort, creativity, and&#13;

also as a provider of advisory services and a promoter of best practices.&#13;
   Our ambition is not growth for the sake of growth. Our ambition is to make a&#13;
difference in our markets by improving the business environment for private investors&#13;
and extending the benefits of economic growth to the underserved; by building capacity                         Overview&#13;
at the enterprise level and increasing competition at the market level; and by working&#13;
with partners that share our commitment to improving corporate governance and&#13;
raising environmental and social standards. These may be broad objectives, but they&#13;
translate into the local, step-by-step victories on the road out of poverty: a new business,&#13;
a first paycheck, a family with a new home, a child with a better education. They&#13;
translate also into regional and global progress toward sustainability: clearer air, cleaner&#13;
water, and healthy ecosystems.&#13;
   Our founders' vision foresaw the growing role of the private sector in development&#13;

Jim Wolfensohn and Peter Woicke in recent years, and the commitment of our new&#13;
president, Paul Wolfowitz, to the Corporation's mission will enable us to celebrate IFC's&#13;
50th anniversary next year with a brighter potential than ever before. Should we succeed&#13;
in fulfilling that potential, the achievement will be shared across the years. We will&#13;

      The International Finance Corporation is at the&#13;
      forefront of private sector development: we are&#13;
      redefining how poverty can be reduced and lives&#13;
      improved through a stronger private sector in&#13;
      emerging markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Accomplishing this goal means reaching people, regions, and sectors that have not yet&#13;
&#13;
      shared in the overall growth of emerging markets. It means innovation--forging new&#13;
&#13;
      partnerships with governments and other multilateral institutions, identifying new roles&#13;
&#13;
      for the private sector, creating products that develop financial markets, and making it&#13;
&#13;
      easier for disadvantaged people to launch a business or own a home. It means building&#13;
&#13;
      on significant strengths in many countries and industries--helping established enterprises&#13;
&#13;
      become more competitive and sustainable as they expand their operations or extend their&#13;
&#13;
      reach into new markets. It also means bringing to developing economies proven products&#13;
&#13;
      and techniques, both from industrialized countries and, increasingly, from other developing&#13;
&#13;
      countries. Above all, it means tailoring our global expertise to local needs. We recognize&#13;
&#13;
      that there is no "business as usual" to our task of helping the private sector make a larger,&#13;
&#13;
      more positive difference for the people living in developing countries. The examples that&#13;

  viability of private enterprises in these markets.&#13;

                                                them build their capacity to provide finance for a wider range of environmental&#13;
                                                and social products and services, especially in sectors, such as renewable energy&#13;

                                                establishing credit bureaus and securities markets. Credit bureaus play an&#13;
                                                indispensable role in expanding credit and enabling economic growth, and IFC&#13;
                                                is involved in developing such bureaus in 34 countries around the globe. A&#13;
                                                functioning securities market also expands the availability and affordability of&#13;
                                                financing, and IFC is helping establish such markets both through engagement&#13;

                                            IFC prioritizes infrastructure because it is the basis for all economic growth and&#13;
                                            development--and because it offers so much scope for the private sector to play&#13;
                                            an innovative role.&#13;
                                                The Corporation is an active investor and advisor in sectors ranging from&#13;

                                            that helps companies and agencies improve the competitiveness and sustainability&#13;
  We also invested $200 million in          of their operations.&#13;
  information and communications                Cornerstones of IFC's efforts include the promotion of public-private&#13;
  technology.                               partnerships to deliver infrastructure services, the expansion of our investment&#13;
                                            and technical assistance efforts to subnational levels of government, and--as in&#13;
                                            all our activities--unwavering attention to the environmental and social impacts&#13;
                                            of the development activities we support. In all these efforts, IFC operates in&#13;
                                            partnership with the institutions of the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
                                            IFC Advisory Services&#13;
                                            IFC provides advice to governments on the structuring and implementation of&#13;
                                            private sector participation in infrastructure, health, and other public services.&#13;
                                            IFC's efforts focus on sustainably expanding access to public services, where we&#13;
                                            can help strike the balance between the objectives of governments and the&#13;
                                            requirements of private investors.&#13;
                                                In FY05, IFC worked on 25 transactions in mining, power, water and&#13;
                                            sanitation, health, solid waste, irrigation, and several sectors of transportation:&#13;
                                            airlines, airports, ports, railways, and urban transit. We completed four transactions:&#13;
                                            Moatize Coal in Mozambique, the concession for operating Madagascar's&#13;
                                            principal port, and public-private partnerships in Morocco and Romania.&#13;
                                            The Moroccan transaction is the developing world's first for irrigation&#13;
                                            services. New projects are underway in Brazil, India, the Philippines, and&#13;
                                            Saudi Arabia, as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands. An&#13;
                                            advisory hub has been created in IFC's Johannesburg office.&#13;

Subnational Financing: The Municipal Fund&#13;
A joint pilot program of IFC and the World Bank, the Municipal&#13;
&#13;
Fund continues to explore ways of investing in municipalities,&#13;
&#13;
municipal entities, and other tiers of local government without&#13;
&#13;
taking sovereign guarantees. Staff have studied over 20 countries&#13;
&#13;
and identified opportunities in markets as varied as Brazil, China,&#13;
&#13;
Colombia, India, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, and Thailand. The&#13;
&#13;
team has built partnerships and alliances with advisors, commercial&#13;
&#13;
and development banks, and bilateral and multilateral donors.&#13;
&#13;
   This initiative has established that subsovereign finance&#13;
&#13;
contributes strongly to IFC's mission, as the potential impact on&#13;
&#13;
development--expanding its benefits to less developed areas and to&#13;
&#13;
poorer people--is substantial. Engaging with municipalities supports&#13;
&#13;
a number of IFC's priorities, including small businesses, housing&#13;
&#13;

                                  As with infrastructure, the social sectors of health and education are a priority for IFC,&#13;
                                  both because they are key to raising living standards and because more involvement from&#13;
                                  the private sector can improve the quality and reach of services.&#13;
                                      IFC invests in private companies that deliver health care or that provide health-related&#13;
                                  services and technologies. Concern with health also underlies much of our emphasis on&#13;
                                  environmental and social development, as we help client companies upgrade their operations&#13;
                                  to international standards or, in a growing number of places, address the unprecedented&#13;
                                  threat to their operations that is posed by the spread of HIV/AIDS.&#13;
                                      IFC also invests in private schools and universities, which are often an essential&#13;
                                  complement to state-run institutions as developing countries struggle to meet a burgeoning&#13;
                                  demand for education. Through an innovative program, we are also helping the business&#13;
                                  schools of industrialized nations share expertise with their counterparts in developing&#13;
                                  countries. Reflecting the knowledge-sharing role of the World Bank Group, IFC develops&#13;
                                  and disseminates best practices in many sectors, sets up forums for policymakers and&#13;
                                  businesspeople to share ideas, and helps client companies upgrade their operations and&#13;

to $1.1 million) to Ghana's Trust Bank on loans extended to&#13;

eligible private schools in the Accra region. The loans will fund&#13;

construction, purchase of educational materials, and other&#13;

Global Trade Finance Program&#13;
Launched in FY05, IFC's Global Trade Finance Program will&#13;
&#13;
support trade with emerging markets worldwide. It extends&#13;
&#13;
and complements the capacity of banks to deliver trade&#13;
&#13;
financing by providing risk coverage in difficult markets.&#13;
&#13;
Targeting banks in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the&#13;
&#13;
Middle East, the $500 million program is open to all regional&#13;
&#13;
and international confirming banks. The resulting network&#13;
&#13;
allows participants to finance their trade conveniently&#13;
&#13;
through any of the bank counterparties in the program.&#13;
&#13;
    IFC will provide partial or full guarantees on the payment&#13;
&#13;
risk of banks in over 70 developing and transition countries,&#13;
&#13;
with the objective of increasing developing countries' share&#13;
&#13;
of global trade and promoting the "south-to-south" flow of                                                                                                                         ess&#13;
goods and services. The guarantees will be used primarily to&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                      ogr&#13;
support short-term trade but will also accommodate longer&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                         Pr&#13;
tenors, of up to three years, for capital goods imports. In&#13;
&#13;
addition, IFC will make pre-export cash advances and                                                                                                                                       in&#13;
provide technical assistance and training for local banks,&#13;
&#13;
helping them achieve best industry standards in trade.&#13;
&#13;
    IFC is spearheading this new approach because trade&#13;
&#13;
finance plays a critical role in economic growth. This                                                                                                                                       Investing&#13;
initiative strengthens local financial institutions and assists&#13;

                                to ensure that business development is equitable, reaching, for example, less&#13;

                                IFC and the World Bank work together on surveying and assessing the investment&#13;
                                climate of developing countries. A database of the surveys has been set up, which&#13;
                                makes data from 30,000 firms accessible to governments considering reforms. In&#13;
                                addition, IFC and the Bank publish the annual Doing Business report, which&#13;
                                provides objective, quantifiable indicators of business regulations in 145 countries;&#13;
                                reform efforts in more than 30 countries have been spurred by the data and&#13;
                                recommendations in the first two editions. Investment climate is also the focus&#13;

                                foreign direct investment and maximize its impact on poverty reduction. Since&#13;
                                1985, FIAS has advised more than 130 countries in more than 600 projects. FIAS&#13;

                                   FIAS completed 74 projects in FY05. These included 16 knowledge&#13;
                                management activities, notably four regional learning events on investment climate&#13;
                                issues, which were held in Bangkok, Cape Town, Istanbul, and Washington.&#13;
                                   FIAS coordinates its activities with other parts of the World Bank Group&#13;
                                and bilateral donors; it increasingly works with IFC's regional facilities.&#13;

Small and Medium Enterprises&#13;
In many developing countries, small and medium enterprises--companies&#13;
with 10 to 300 employees and annual sales of $100,000 to $15 million--are&#13;
a key source of employment and critical to economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction. Strengthening these firms as well as microenterprises--businesses&#13;
with fewer than 10 employees and less than $100,000 in turnover--is a&#13;
priority for IFC.&#13;
    In FY05, commitments to institutions focused on smaller enterprises, such&#13;
as microfinance institutions, banks, or leasing companies, reached $1.1 billion,&#13;
up from $718 million in FY04. We also strengthen smaller enterprises through&#13;
our technical assistance programs, which help establish a more favorable policy&#13;
environment for local businesses, build capacity at financial institutions that&#13;
finance smaller enterprises, and expand the range of business services available&#13;
to these enterprises.&#13;
    IFC assists smaller businesses through a network of regional facilities, which&#13;
tailor services to meet local demand, as well as the IFC-IDA program for micro,&#13;
small, and medium enterprise development in Sub-Saharan Africa; linkage&#13;
programs, which extend the benefits of large IFC investments to local firms and&#13;
communities; the Strengthening Grassroots Business Initiative (see box); and&#13;

                                               relevant to a rapidly evolving marketplace, this year the Corporation pushed ahead with&#13;
                                               an integrated review of our existing Safeguard Policies; Policy on Disclosure of&#13;

                                                   The review involved a broad consultation process with stakeholders around the world,&#13;

Making a Difference in the Extractive Industries&#13;
In association with the World Bank and MIGA, IFC has begun implementing&#13;
&#13;
a set of proposals to improve the governance, revenue management, and&#13;
&#13;
community involvement of the extractive industries--oil, gas, and mining--&#13;
&#13;
in which we invest. This reflects the recent Extractive Industries Review, which&#13;
&#13;
consisted of independent evaluations of World Bank Group involvement in this&#13;
&#13;
sector; during FY05, the Board endorsed a response from the management&#13;
&#13;
of IFC, the World Bank, and MIGA. The Bank Group is setting up an Extractive&#13;
&#13;
Industries Advisory Group, which will draw on the experience of outstanding&#13;
&#13;
representatives from a range of stakeholder groups to provide advice and&#13;
&#13;
a forum for discussing key issues in these industries. As part of an overall&#13;
&#13;
commitment to sustainability, the Bank Group will also increase its investments&#13;
&#13;
in natural gas and renewable energies, as well as in projects that improve&#13;
&#13;
energy efficiency.&#13;

                            ACLEDA Bank Receives IFC Client Leadership Award&#13;
                             IFC presents an annual Client Leadership Award to recognize a highly&#13;
&#13;
                             successful corporate client that, in line with IFC's mission, has made a&#13;
&#13;
                             significant contribution to sustainable development. This year's award&#13;
&#13;
                             goes to ACLEDA Bank Plc, a leading private bank serving micro and small&#13;
&#13;
                             enterprises in Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
                                 With IFC's support, ACLEDA has transformed itself from a nongovernmental&#13;
&#13;
                             organization focusing on rural development into a first-tier commercial bank.&#13;
&#13;
                             Established in 1993, the Association of Cambodian Local Economic&#13;
&#13;
                             Development Agencies began its transition into a full-service bank in 1998,&#13;
&#13;
                             assisted by IFC's Mekong Private Sector Development Facility, the United&#13;
&#13;
                             Nations Development Program, and other international aid agencies. Through&#13;
&#13;
                             investments in 2000 and 2004, IFC established an equity stake in ACLEDA,&#13;
&#13;
                             mobilized other investors, and provided financing to expand the bank's lending&#13;
&#13;
                             to microenterprises. The transformation is a success: today ACLEDA is&#13;
&#13;
                             Cambodia's second-largest bank in terms of market share on loans outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
                             Its strong profitability has exceeded business targets and makes it a top&#13;
&#13;
                             performer among microfinance institutions worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
                                 With 136 branches and offices, ACLEDA has expanded coverage to&#13;
&#13;
                             more than 130,000 active borrowers and to areas not usually served by&#13;
&#13;
                             formal financial institutions. About 66 percent of its clients are women. As&#13;
&#13;
                             part of its efforts to raise living standards, it has introduced a loan product&#13;
&#13;
                             for small power generation facilities that serve remote districts and has&#13;
&#13;
                             invested in communications infrastructure to support money transfers&#13;
&#13;
                             between its rural branches. ACLEDA has aligned with industry best practices&#13;
&#13;
                             in training and compensation for staff, and it has drawn on IFC's expertise in&#13;
&#13;
      (3)                    implementing effective environmental management.&#13;
&#13;
                                 ACLEDA's success demonstrates how providing financial services to low-&#13;
         ACLEDA&#13;

               OF            income entrepreneurs makes sound business sense in emerging markets. It&#13;

At its launch, the International Finance Corporation became the first multilateral organization&#13;
&#13;
to have as its main objective the promotion of private enterprise. Today, it remains one of the                                             50&#13;
few multilaterals to assume full commercial risks alongside private investors in emerging&#13;
&#13;
markets. The idea of an institution to spur private sector investment in poor countries--&#13;
&#13;
complementing the World Bank's lending to governments--had been broached at the&#13;
&#13;
founding of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1944. In the summer of 1956,&#13;
&#13;
IFC's first loans, for manufacturing projects in Brazil and Mexico, put the World Bank Group&#13;
&#13;
on course to making that vision a reality.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                           years&#13;
    In half a century of growth, IFC has remained the largest multilateral source of loan and&#13;
&#13;
equity financing for private sector projects in developing countries, even coining the term&#13;
&#13;
"emerging markets" for the clients we serve. We have been a key investor in more than                                                          1956-2006&#13;
3,300 companies, a catalyst for partnerships in commercial investment and technical assistance,&#13;
&#13;
and a champion of best practice with global expertise to help firms and the government&#13;
&#13;
entities that work with them. We have played a leading role in building recognition that&#13;
&#13;
developing and transition countries offer sound and sustainable business opportunities. The&#13;

                  Nigeria: Helping the Smallest Businesses Access Finance&#13;
&#13;
                  Poor access to finance seriously impedes development of the micro and small enterprise sector&#13;
&#13;
                  in Nigeria; 85 percent of the country's firms have access only to short-term credit. IFC is helping&#13;
&#13;
                  Nigeria's government address the problem. The country's commercial banks are now required&#13;
&#13;
                  to set aside 10 percent of pretax profits for investments in the equity of smaller businesses. IFC&#13;
&#13;
                  is helping them do so through the new Micro Finance Institution, which specializes in funding&#13;
&#13;
                  micro and small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
                      The MFI was launched with initial capital of $5 million, with ACCION International providing&#13;
&#13;
                  technical and management expertise. IFC has taken an equity investment along with several&#13;
&#13;
                  large Nigerian banks, and ACCION is the lead investor. Funding for technical assistance is&#13;
&#13;
                  coming from the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Program, a collaborative effort of IFC&#13;
&#13;
                  and IDA. This is IFC's first investment under the program.&#13;
&#13;
                      The institution's specialization will help it streamline credit evaluation procedures and&#13;
&#13;
                  implement tailored systems for information management and monitoring of microloans. Its&#13;

Nigeria: Assisting an Industry with&#13;
a Pivotal Role in Development&#13;
&#13;
IFC is providing $75 million for construction and operation of a&#13;
&#13;
greenfield cement plant with a capacity of 4.4 million tons a year at&#13;
&#13;
Obajana in Nigeria's Kogi state. One of IFC's largest investments in&#13;
&#13;
the country or the region, it is being implemented by Dangote&#13;
&#13;
Industries Limited, a leading Nigerian conglomerate, and will fill a&#13;
&#13;
supply gap in the country's cement market. Whereas over 75 percent&#13;
&#13;
of the annual consumption of 10.6 million tons is currently&#13;
&#13;
imported, the project will use locally available limestone, gypsum,&#13;
&#13;
and natural gas to produce cement at a competitive price. Better&#13;

availability of cement will promote investment in infrastructure, as&#13;
&#13;
well as in industrial, commercial, and residential construction. These&#13;
&#13;
are acute needs in a nation of 134 million people.&#13;
&#13;
    The project will generate employment and improve the standard&#13;
&#13;
of living in a part of Nigeria with limited industrial activities. It will&#13;
&#13;
also create jobs indirectly through formal and informal businesses&#13;
&#13;
serving the plant and its employees. IFC is helping Dangote                                                                                               Sub-Saharan&#13;

HIV/AIDS. This year, MTN Nigeria received guidance in developing&#13;
&#13;
an AIDS policy, conducting a specialized survey, offering peer&#13;
&#13;
education, and providing anti-retroviral treatment to employees and&#13;
&#13;
their dependents. In Kenya, Magadi Soda also began providing&#13;
&#13;
this treatment; IFC Against AIDS will continue to strengthen the&#13;
&#13;
company's internal program and develop funding proposals to&#13;
&#13;
expand it in the community. IFC Against AIDS also worked with&#13;
&#13;
the South African company Hernic Ferrochrome to help shape its&#13;
&#13;
HIV/AIDS education and prevention program. In Nigeria, IFC&#13;
&#13;
provided assistance to the Dangote Group in drafting an AIDS&#13;

policy, outlining an intervention strategy, and identifying partners&#13;

                                       destination for foreign investors. IFC has made a number of&#13;

                                       investments in Celtel since 1994, helping the company as it&#13;

     The Philippines: A Private Sector Approach to Land Registration&#13;
&#13;
     Property rights can support economic growth and development but only when they are formalized, for example through land titling and&#13;
&#13;
     registration. This is crucial for poor people, who may have assets--basic housing, informal businesses--but lack formal rights to them.&#13;
&#13;
     Lacking rights constrains people's ability to use assets as collateral and raise capital for small enterprises. It can also preclude entrepreneurs&#13;
&#13;
     from connecting to the formal economy, making it difficult or illegal for them to obtain utility services.&#13;
&#13;
         In the Philippines, IFC is helping the government address this problem. A leader in privatization, the Philippines has awarded concessions&#13;
&#13;
     for various public utilities and selected government services. To meet the urgent need for land registration and titling, it awarded a&#13;
&#13;
     concession to Land Registration Systems, Inc., a local private company, to computerize and connect the 162 offices of the country's land&#13;
&#13;
     registration authority. By building a database and network infrastructure, the privatization will increase the authority's efficiency and the&#13;
&#13;
     security, quality, and accessibility of land title information. It will also improve the process of issuing land records.&#13;
&#13;
         IFC has provided a loan of $22 million and a quasi-equity instrument of $2.7 million to support this privatization, which we expect to&#13;
&#13;
     send a positive signal to the market and demonstrate the viability of service concessions to other governments. The project also complements&#13;
&#13;
     the World Bank's efforts to promote broader institutional reforms in land administration.&#13;

     China: Upgrading Bank Operations and Securing Foreign Investment&#13;
&#13;
     The challenges facing Chinese banks in general--high levels of nonperforming loans, a thin capital base, management and governance in&#13;
&#13;
     need of strengthening--are amplified among the city commercial banks that China established by consolidating some 2,000 urban credit&#13;
&#13;
     cooperatives in large and midsize cities. These institutions also face heavy local government influence and are restricted to conducting&#13;
&#13;
     business only within their city boundaries. IFC has been helping the Bank of Beijing build its business amid these challenges.&#13;
&#13;
         Soon after the bank's founding in 1996, IFC provided technical assistance to improve its credit risk management and formulate overall&#13;
&#13;
     business strategies. The bank has considered IFC a close partner ever since, consulting us in its ongoing efforts to improve management&#13;
&#13;
     and asset quality and recently seeking our advice in the selection of an international strategic investor. IFC's involvement has been encouraged&#13;
&#13;
     by Chinese regulators, who believe that the development of Beijing's city commercial bank, the country's second-largest, could have a&#13;
&#13;
     strong demonstration effect for financial sector reform across China.&#13;
&#13;
         In FY05, IFC made an equity investment in the Bank of Beijing of up to RMB479 million (about $58 million). The Netherlands' ING Bank&#13;
&#13;
     is taking just under the 20 percent ceiling that a single foreign investor is allowed to invest in a Chinese bank; the combined investment&#13;
&#13;
     will reach the 25 percent maximum imposed by the country's banking regulators for combined foreign shareholdings in a domestic bank.&#13;
&#13;
     The funding initiates a comprehensive strategic alliance. ING will provide technical and management support to the Bank of Beijing,&#13;
&#13;
     helping expand its retail business, providing training to staff, and nominating personnel to senior management positions. The Bank of&#13;
&#13;
     Beijing will use its strong branch network across the city's 12 districts to promote the insurance business of ING's joint ventures in China.&#13;

India: Investing in Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals&#13;
&#13;
Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals could potentially be major growth sectors in India's economy. To support these emerging&#13;
&#13;
industries, IFC made three investments during FY05. The first is an equity investment in the APIDC Biotechnology Fund, which will&#13;
&#13;
make equity and equity-related investments in start-up and early-stage life sciences businesses working in such areas as health care,&#13;
&#13;
drug discovery, agriculture, dairy, and environmental and industrial applications. IFC's investment will enable the fund to take&#13;
&#13;
significant minority stakes in Indian businesses; it plans to build a portfolio of 20 to 25 companies with an average transaction size of&#13;
&#13;
$1.5 million. IFC also made its first direct investment in a biotech company, Bharat Biotech India Limited, a firm in Hyderabad that&#13;
&#13;
develops, manufactures, distributes, and markets vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. IFC's equity investment will help the company&#13;
&#13;
expand its development and production of new products, as well as improve its marketing and sales efforts. As the first international&#13;
&#13;
institutional investor in Bharat Biotech, IFC will assist the company in establishing good corporate governance and help it ensure timely&#13;
&#13;
financial reporting and sound financial management. IFC also invested equity in Dabur Pharma, a leading pharmaceutical company in&#13;
&#13;
India. This investment will help the company expand and upgrade its manufacturing facilities to meet regulatory requirements in the&#13;
&#13;
United States and the European Union, obtain regulatory approvals for sales of generic oncology products in these markets, and&#13;
&#13;
enhance its corporate governance practices.                                                                                                                                        Asia&#13;

India: A Pioneering Investment in Cleaner Energy&#13;
&#13;
IFC has made a combined $49 million loan and equity investment in AD Hydro&#13;
&#13;
Power Limited in the Himalayas of northern India. The project is one of the first&#13;
&#13;
hydropower plants in the developing world to be financed on a merchant basis,&#13;
&#13;
with the private sector taking market risk. IFC's funding supports construction,&#13;
&#13;
operation, and maintenance of a 192 megawatt run-of-river hydroelectric power&#13;
&#13;
plant and a 185-kilometer, 220-kilovolt transmission line. The plant will help&#13;
&#13;
meet a growing demand for electricity and alleviate peak shortages in the region.&#13;
&#13;
It will be developed mainly by Indian contractors and suppliers, generating short-&#13;
&#13;
term and permanent jobs as well as substantial revenues to the state and&#13;
&#13;
national governments through royalties and taxes. By using a renewable source&#13;
&#13;
of energy, the plant will help reduce reliance on thermal power, which produces&#13;
&#13;
greenhouse gases and particulate emissions. The project encourages private&#13;
&#13;
hydropower development and private participation in India's power sector. To&#13;
&#13;
ensure that local communities benefit from the investment, IFC will provide&#13;
&#13;
technical assistance to promote forest and wildlife conservation, links with&#13;
&#13;
smaller local businesses, and sustainable tourism in the area.&#13;

    Georgia and Turkey: Vehicle Leasing&#13;
    Spurs Business Growth&#13;
&#13;
     Throughout Europe and Central Asia, IFC promotes leasing as a key source&#13;
&#13;
     of financing for growing companies. In Georgia, for example, our Private&#13;
&#13;
     Enterprise Partnership has worked with the government to improve leasing&#13;
&#13;
     legislation, assessed the market to determine the sectors most in need of&#13;
&#13;
     leasing, and trained and advised companies on the benefits of leasing. This&#13;
&#13;
     year IFC lent $3 million to TBC Leasing, one of Georgia's first leasing firms,&#13;
&#13;
     allowing it to meet demand for this new financial product.&#13;

         One company this helps is Clauss, a small, growing business whose&#13;
&#13;
     42 employees deliver food and beverage products around Tbilisi. In two&#13;

     years, Clauss has grown from a start-up to become the market leader in&#13;

                                  Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer), a Brazilian company listed on the New York&#13;

&#13;
                              exporter. But due to perceived country risk, Embraer--like other top-rated Brazilian borrowers--&#13;
&#13;
                              has limited access to loans in the international market with tenors of five or more years.&#13;

                              international reporting standards into its internal financial monitoring. In addition to the&#13;

An Ongoing Commitment to Microfinance&#13;
&#13;
IFC's portfolio of microfinance investments in Latin America and the Caribbean covers countries as varied as Bolivia, El Salvador, Haiti,                                       Caribbean&#13;
Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru. These include key investments in specialized, privately managed funds that operate on a regional level. Our&#13;
&#13;
efforts emphasize activities and transactions that effectively connect microfinance institutions with financial and capital markets, and we                                              the&#13;
are developing and working with private sector investors and funds that have a focus on microfinance. We are also responding to the&#13;
&#13;
demand among microfinance institutions for innovative investment structures, including bond issues and securitizations, that allow them                                                     and&#13;
to reach new groups of investors such as local pension funds.&#13;
&#13;
    This year, IFC invested $430 million in three microfinance operations in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. By developing creative structures&#13;
&#13;
and instruments and partnering with bilateral institutions, multilaterals, and NGOs, we are reaching out to entrepreneurs in segments&#13;
&#13;
traditionally excluded from the formal economy, including women, indigenous groups, and people in rural areas.                                                                                 America&#13;
    An investment in Mexico's Financiera Compartamos is a key example. With IFC's help, Compartamos has closed a bond transaction&#13;
&#13;
that greatly improves its access to financing from institutional investors. Some 300,000 Mexican small businesses, the vast majority of them&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                      Latin&#13;
run by women, rely on microloans from Compartamos, which is registered in Mexico as a sofol, a nondeposit­taking financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
The company's ability to tap the markets is critical for its expansion. In July 2004, Compartamos issued five-year, Mexican peso bonds&#13;
&#13;
equivalent to $15 million. The issue was partially guaranteed by IFC for 34 percent of the outstanding principal amount. Our guarantee&#13;
&#13;
helped the bond issue achieve high ratings from both Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch. The transaction was named the Best Structured Bond&#13;
&#13;
of the year by LatinFinance.&#13;

    Peru: Broader Benefits from Mining&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is helping companies in the mining sector upgrade their social and&#13;
&#13;
     environmental performance so that more local people benefit. In&#13;
&#13;
     addition to financing, we are providing training and technical&#13;
&#13;
     assistance that build stronger ties between these companies and&#13;
&#13;
     surrounding communities, as well as to the smaller businesses that can&#13;
&#13;
     serve as suppliers of goods and services. The goal is to promote&#13;
&#13;
     sustainable economic development around the mining projects in&#13;
&#13;
     which we invest. In Peru, for example, IFC and the World Bank are&#13;
&#13;
     strengthening local municipalities' capacity to manage funds that the&#13;
&#13;
     Yanacocha mine generates, as well as helping disseminate information&#13;
&#13;
     on the mine in order to increase transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
     Working through local NGOs and service providers, we have helped&#13;
&#13;
     local small and medium enterprises improve their business skills and&#13;
&#13;
     their access to finance--in some cases expanding their role as suppliers&#13;
&#13;
     to the mine. With IFC's encouragement, the Yanacocha mine has set&#13;
&#13;
     up a foundation that is undertaking broader community development&#13;
&#13;
     programs in health care, education, agriculture, forestry, and&#13;
&#13;
     microfinance. Yanacocha also supports directly an extensive rural&#13;
&#13;
     development program for communities near the mine.&#13;

&#13;
ABN AMRO Banco Real that supports long-term on-&#13;
&#13;
lending targeted to sustainability. The funding will&#13;
&#13;
finance firms for environment-related projects as&#13;
&#13;
well as small and medium enterprises whose work&#13;
&#13;
addresses climate change, loss of biodiversity, land&#13;
&#13;
degradation, and persistent organic pollutants. A&#13;
&#13;
long-time IFC client, ABN AMRO was one of the&#13;
&#13;
original adopters of the Equator Principles--voluntary&#13;
&#13;
standards based on IFC's environmental and social&#13;
&#13;
guidelines. And now its Brazilian operation, Banco&#13;
&#13;
Real, is the world's first financial institution to target&#13;
&#13;
a large IFC credit line specifically to advancing                                                                                            Caribbean&#13;

&#13;
encourage a wide range of reforms that promote                                                                                                           and&#13;

    Saudi Arabia: Upgrading a Key Airport Terminal&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is advising Saudi Arabia's aviation authority on private sector participation to expand and rehabilitate the Hajj Terminal at the King Abdulaziz&#13;
&#13;
     International Airport in Jeddah, which is used by Muslims visiting the holy city of Mecca during the hajj and umrah pilgrimages. The hajj season&#13;
&#13;
     takes place over a six-week period, creating unusually heavy air traffic in a concentrated time frame. Given the number of pilgrims to be&#13;
&#13;
     accommodated and the diverse requirements of the hajj, the facility was designed and built in 1981 to function much like a large village in the&#13;
&#13;
     range of services it provides. With improvements in air transport, the number of pilgrims has grown significantly, reaching an estimated 2.5 million&#13;
&#13;
     people in 2004. The terminal's facilities have become inadequate, and its capacity is constraining the growth of the pilgrimage itself.&#13;
&#13;
         To alleviate this situation and accommodate future growth, the aviation authority has enlisted IFC's help to bring in the private sector under a "build&#13;
&#13;
     then own" scheme. The project represents the first large-scale private sector involvement in an air terminal in the Middle East. The Saudi government&#13;
&#13;
     intends to use the Hajj Terminal as a model for private sector participation that can be replicated at other airport terminals in the country.&#13;

    Morocco: An Innovative&#13;
    Bond Issue in Local Currency&#13;
&#13;
     IFC broke new ground in the region this year with&#13;
&#13;
     innovative financial transactions. The Corporation became&#13;
&#13;
     the first supranational to launch a bond issue in the African&#13;
&#13;
     continent or the Middle East. The bond, denominated in&#13;
&#13;
     Moroccan dirhams and launched in Morocco's domestic&#13;
&#13;
     capital market, will help develop that market and will&#13;
&#13;
     provide a benchmark for future bond issuers. The issue was&#13;
&#13;
     for seven-year bonds totaling 1 billion dirhams (equivalent&#13;
&#13;
     to about $117 million). The bonds were targeted to&#13;
&#13;
     domestic institutional investors, and the transaction was&#13;
&#13;
     listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange. More than&#13;
&#13;
     20 investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds,&#13;
&#13;
     and pension funds, purchased the paper. The success of&#13;
&#13;
     the issue shows how far Morocco has come in instituting&#13;
&#13;
     structural reforms in its local financial markets. IFC worked&#13;
&#13;
     closely with Moroccan authorities for two years to bring&#13;
&#13;
     this transaction to fruition. The results demonstrate the&#13;
&#13;
     effective partnerships IFC can establish with governments&#13;
&#13;
     to support capital market development.&#13;

    Iraq: Lending Targets Smaller Businesses&#13;
&#13;
     This year IFC and our partners committed $12 million to the Iraq&#13;
&#13;
     National Bank under the Iraq Small Business Finance Facility, which&#13;
&#13;
     supports development of micro and small businesses in the country&#13;
&#13;
     through local financial intermediaries.&#13;
&#13;
         IFC is contributing up to $50 million to the facility for on-lending to&#13;
&#13;
     smaller businesses, along with $40 million in donor funding from Japan,&#13;
&#13;
     Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
     will develop the capacity of local Iraqi banks, so that they can operate&#13;
&#13;
     on a modern, transparent, and financially sound basis and develop their&#13;
&#13;
     lending to smaller enterprises. By providing these partner banks with&#13;
&#13;
     long-term resources to on-lend, the facility will help put entrepreneurial&#13;
&#13;
     businesses back on their feet and create jobs in the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
         The Iraq National Bank has entered into a joint venture with the&#13;
&#13;
     Export and Finance Bank of Jordan, which has assumed management&#13;
&#13;
     responsibility. The project is expected to have a very strong developmental&#13;
&#13;
     impact, improving the lives of ordinary Iraqis by helping them acquire&#13;
&#13;
     new capital assets for the businesses they run.                                                                                            ISBFF&#13;

                                            Syndicated Loans&#13;
                                             Syndicated loans, or B-loans, are a key part of IFC's efforts to&#13;
                                             mobilize private sector financing in developing countries, thereby&#13;
                                             broadening our development impact. Through this mechanism,&#13;

  A-loan and B-loan. A single loan agreement between the borrower and IFC normally stipulates the full amount of financing to be provided&#13;
&#13;
  by IFC and the participating institutions. The IFC loan may be in two portions: (1) the A-loan is IFC's own portion, funded with IFC's own&#13;
&#13;
  resources and subject to its agreed loan terms; (2) the B-loan is funded by participants on terms that may differ from those of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Commitments include (1) signed loan and equity (including quasi-equity) investment agreements; (2) signed guarantee agreements; and (3)&#13;
&#13;
  risk management facilities that are considered ready for execution as evidenced by a signed ISDA agreement or a signed risk management&#13;
&#13;
  agreement with a client.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Disbursements are loans and investments paid out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY05 began on July 1, 2004, and ended on June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Investment amounts are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  On-lending is the process of lending funds from IFC's own sources through intermediaries, such as local banks and microfinance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of projects, but because IFC is the lender of record, participants receive the same&#13;
&#13;
  tax and country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status as a multilateral financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features, which are designed to provide varying degrees of risk/return trade-offs&#13;
&#13;
  that lie between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of individual figures in some tables.&#13;

2005 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
VOLUME 1&#13;
&#13;
At IFC our mandate is to further sustainable&#13;
economic development through the private sector.&#13;
We pursue this goal through innovative solutions&#13;
to the challenges of development, as we invest in&#13;
companies and financial institutions in emerging&#13;
markets and as we help build business skills. We&#13;
consider positive development impact an integral&#13;
part of good business, and we focus much of our&#13;
effort on the countries with the greatest need for&#13;
investment. We recognize that economic growth&#13;
is sustainable only if it is environmentally and&#13;
socially sound and helps improve the quality of&#13;
life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2005 : investing in progress with experience,
            innovation, and partnership
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report for the fiscal year 2005
            concerns the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which
            demonstrated a third consecutive year of record growth,
            owing to the strong economic performance of many developing
            member countries. The financial results set the stage for a
            planned expansion in IFC's investments and advisory
            services. The report outlines the strategic objectives of
            the institution in expanding access to finance, increasing
            private participation in key sectors, helping successful
            enterprises grow, focusing where needs are greatest, and
            ensuring sustainability. The organization is at the
            forefront of private sector development by redefining how
            poverty can be reduced and by improving a stronger private
            sectors in emerging markets. Accomplishing this goal means
            reaching people, regions, and sectors that have not yet
            shared in the overall growth of emerging markets. It means
            innovation, forging new partnerships with governments and
            other multilateral institutions, identifying new roles for
            the private sector, creating products that develop financial
            markets, and making it easier for disadvantaged people to
            launch a business or own a home. It means building on
            significant strengths in many countries and
            industries-helping established enterprises become more
            competitive and sustainable as they expand their operations
            or extend their reach into new markets. It also means
            bringing to developing economies proven products and
            techniques, both from industrialized countries and,
            increasingly, from other developing countries. Above all it
            means tailoring global expertise to local needs.
