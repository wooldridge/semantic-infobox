I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic Growth and Impact&#13;
1.1      Vietnam is located in mainland Southeast Asia, stretching over 1,600 km from&#13;
the Chinese border in the north to the Gulf of Thailand in the south. The country's land&#13;
area is approximately 330,000 km2 and the population now exceeds 70 million. The main&#13;
sector of economic activity is agriculture, with over 80% of households engaged in that&#13;
sector alone. Per capita income is estimated at US$250 per year (1995), one of the lowest&#13;
in the world. However, in 1989, Vietnam introduced an ambitious economic reform&#13;
program (Doi Moi) and is committed to make the transition to a market economy. The&#13;
implementation of Doi Moi policies includes liberalization, decentralization, expansion of&#13;
international relations and strong emphasis on the industrial sector. The result is an actual&#13;
economic growth rate exceeding expectations: an average of 6.5 percent from 1990 to&#13;
1992, 8.1 percent in 1993, 9.0 percent in 1994 and 9.5 percent in 1995. Construction was&#13;
the fastest growing sector in 1994 with 19%, followed by industry at 14% and services&#13;
(which continued to expand rapidly) at 10%. Agricultural value added increased 4%.&#13;
B. The Transport System&#13;
1.2      To support its rapid economic growth, Vietnam needs a strong transport&#13;
sector, both in terms of quantity and quality. However, the actual transport infrastructure&#13;
(road, rail, river, maritime, air and pipeline) is dilapidated and unreliable and the transport&#13;
fleet is obsolete. Road is by far the most widely used transport mode, both for freight and&#13;
passengers. The road network consists of 106,000 km of roads, 10% of which are paved.&#13;
In the vicinity of large urban areas such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and&#13;
Haiphong, the main highways will soon become inadequate to handle the rapidly&#13;
increasing traffic flows. Large flows of bicycles and the presence of pedestrians on the&#13;
roads reduce vehicle speeds and are a frequent cause of accidents. Road foundations and&#13;
surfaces, mostly in the north, have not been designed for heavy trucks and have suffered&#13;
substantial damage. A significant proportion of roads become impassable after heavy&#13;
rains; a large number of bridges require rehabilitation or replacement; and almost all&#13;
ferries need upgrading. Road construction, maintenance techniques and equipment&#13;
require modernization.&#13;
1.3      The rail network consists of six lines in operation and two branch lines, totaling&#13;
2,528 km. The network condition is considered unsatisfactory. It is subject to flooding&#13;
on several sections and different gauges create operational problems between some&#13;
provinces. Most bridges and tunnels are seriously deteriorated and operating speed is&#13;
limited on 30% of the total length. Approximately one third of Vietnam's locomotive fleet&#13;
consists of obsolete steam engines and there is a serious capacity shortage for repairing&#13;
and maintaining the diesel fleet. Passenger coaches and freight wagons are improperly&#13;
maintained and in poor condition. Government has obtained funds from Japan (OECF) to&#13;
rehabilitate major tunnels and bridges in the rail network, so as to improve operational&#13;
speeds. As in many other countries, the railway's poor physical and operating condition is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
compounded by its loss of comparative advantage vis-a-vis road transport. Thus, it is&#13;
estimated that the railway is about four times larger than required for the volume of traffic&#13;
it is likely to capture and retain in the long run.&#13;
1.4      Vietnam has a large inland waterway network suitable for year-round&#13;
transportation, totaling approximately 11,000 km. The capacity of the inland waterway&#13;
network is sufficient to cope with the current demand but the fleet condition and operation&#13;
methods are in need of modernization and dredging is backlogged. The national sea-&#13;
going fleet is relatively small and consists of small, old ships, not adapted to market&#13;
requirements. The state-owned shipping companies are no longer subsidized which has&#13;
forced them to seek private and foreign partners. Several seaports are in operation, some&#13;
for general cargo and some dedicated to petroleum and coal. Most port equipment is old,&#13;
operations are inefficient and there is inadequate equipment to handle containers. The two&#13;
ports at Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) are being modernized with assistance&#13;
from the donor community.&#13;
1.5      The air transport system also needs selective rehabilitation and upgrading,&#13;
especially the terminal facilities and air traffic control equipment at the international&#13;
airports of Hanoi and HCMC. Vietnam Airline's carrying capacity is inadequate; its&#13;
operational and maintenance techniques need upgrading and it needs to purchase some&#13;
new aircraft.&#13;
1.6      Looking to the future, it can be concluded that continued rapid economic&#13;
growth, a more diversified economic base and high growth rates in foreign trade would&#13;
rapidly expand freight traffic, as experienced in Thailand, Malaysia and China. Likewise,&#13;
with rising personal incomes and mobility, the demand for high quality short and long-&#13;
distance passenger transport will increase substantially. A Bank Transport Sector Report&#13;
(TSR)I estimated that total freight traffic would likely increase at annual rates between&#13;
7% and 11% for the remainder of the decade (with similar growth rates for passenger&#13;
transport), although with wide variations for each transport mode. Road freight traffic&#13;
would grow rapidly (between 9% and 15% p.a.), rail traffic most slowly (between 2% and&#13;
4% p.a.) and inland waterway traffic between 4% and 6% p.a. Passenger transport by air&#13;
is projected to grow most rapidly between 10% and 25% p.a., followed by road passenger&#13;
transport (between 10% and 17% p.a.). By contrast, inland waterways and rail passenger&#13;
transport are expected to grow much below average, between 2% and 5% p.a.&#13;
C. Transport Reforms&#13;
1.7      In line with Vietnam's economic reform program a number of important&#13;
reforms have been undertaken in the transport sector. Notably the Government has:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
*  eliminated allocation of cargo to specific modes;&#13;
*  abolished prescribed tariffs for road and inland waterway freight transport&#13;
(except for certain commodities considered of strategic and social importance)&#13;
and decentralized control over passenger fares which are now determined by&#13;
the provinces;&#13;
* replaced controls over entry by less restrictive licensing arrangements and&#13;
allowed own-account fleets (including the military) to carry for third parties;&#13;
*  opened interurban passenger transport to competition, in stages, and placed&#13;
urban passenger transport under the control of the people's committees which&#13;
allocate routes and determine prices;&#13;
*  commercialized state transport enterprises and abolished their most direct&#13;
operating subsidies;&#13;
*  allowed the establishment of private transport enterprises and private&#13;
participation in transport infrastructure investment and operation;&#13;
*  reorganized the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOT) into&#13;
modal administrations with broad responsibilities under the overall authority&#13;
of the minister;&#13;
*  initiated first steps towards cost recovery from users of transport&#13;
infrastructure provided by the state.&#13;
D. Sector Development Strategy&#13;
1.8      In its strategy for development, the Government of Vietnam has accorded a&#13;
high priority to the transport sector. The Bank's TSR suggests criteria to determine the&#13;
share appropriate to transport, considering past experience in the region, economic&#13;
constraints, investment needed to meet development targets, absorptive capacity of the&#13;
executing agencies and the roles of state and non-state sectors. Based on these factors,&#13;
the TSR suggests that the public sector allocate 2 - 3% of GDP per year for the next 10-&#13;
15 years to restore, modernize and maintain Vietnam's transport system. This would&#13;
provide approximately US$680 million per year and US$4.1 billion for a six-year period.&#13;
In addition, the non-state sector would need to spend 1.5 - 2% of GDP per year for&#13;
vehicles, equipment and other commercial infrastructure. Priority investments will aim at&#13;
the rehabilitation of key infrastructure, modernization of obsolete equipment and&#13;
institutional strengthening for management and maintenance. In addition, the TSR&#13;
recommends market-based policies for the development of the transport sector, such as&#13;
cost-based user charge policies, sustainable public funding, privately based industrial&#13;
organization, competitive transport markets and increased management efficiency.&#13;
1.9      The TSR recommended further that a number of comprehensive studies should&#13;
be carried out for roads, inland waterways, ports and urban transport to provide the basis&#13;
for a coordinated overall sector development plan, taking into account existing and future&#13;
resource constraints. These studies are now underway, funded by various bilateral and&#13;
multilateral sources. In addition, a UNDP funded public expenditure review is underway&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
which will help ensure the sectoral and cross-sectoral coherence of the Government's&#13;
overall development program. With regard to roads, a study financed under ODA of the&#13;
UK, has proposed a medium-term investment and maintenance strategy for intercity,&#13;
national and provincial roads. The study has: (a) defined a 10-year program of road,&#13;
bridge and ferry improvements and maintenance, (b) estimated budget needs for road&#13;
maintenance and administration; and (c) proposed an optimum balance between&#13;
investments and maintenance based on assessed expenditure priorities under alternative&#13;
multi-period budget scenarios.&#13;
E. Remaining Challenges&#13;
1.10     In the future the above reform initiatives should be deepened in order to&#13;
eliminate any remaining impediments to efficient markets and transport institutions and&#13;
much more needs to be done with regard to restoring, modernizing and maintaining the&#13;
essential transport infrastructure. In particular, the Government will need to carry out&#13;
(with donor support where appropriate) the following agenda over the next decade:&#13;
* capital expenditure for public transport infrastructure and facilities should be&#13;
increased and maintained at a level of about 2-3% of GDP in real terms;&#13;
* the budget allocation for recurrent expenditure (operating and maintenance&#13;
expenses) should be increased by a factor of two from 1995 levels (adjusted&#13;
yearly for inflation) and modern maintenance management techniques should&#13;
be introduced;&#13;
*   investment planning and project selection should be coordinated between the&#13;
various levels of government and based on rational selection criteria;&#13;
L the role of the Government as owner and operator of conmmercially viable&#13;
transport services (e.g. trucking, shipping, port services) should gradually be&#13;
reduced, leaving these operations to the private sector;&#13;
* remaining restrictions on entry, competition and other regulations governing&#13;
transport markets (including subsidies) should gradually be eliminated and&#13;
replaced with a regulatory framework and institutions that ensure fair&#13;
competition, appropriate quality standards for the transport industry, safety&#13;
and the efficient use of transport infrastructure and other assets;&#13;
* realign prices for commercial public services and user charges for the&#13;
provision of infrastructure so that they fully reflect the economic costs of their&#13;
use;&#13;
* continue the strengthening of transport institutions;&#13;
* modernize transport training and research, and upgrade manpower skills.&#13;
F. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement&#13;
1.11     Since lending to Vietnam has been resumed fairly recently, no transport project&#13;
has yet been completed. The first transport project (Highway Rehabilitation Project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Credit No. 2549-VN ) was approved by the Board in October 1993 and became effective in&#13;
June 1994. While it is too early for a definitive assessment of the project implementation&#13;
experience, the problems so far are mainly due to difficulties encountered across all sectors;&#13;
in particular: the authorities' inexperience with the requirements of international lending&#13;
agencies; unfamiliarity with IDA procedures; inadequate legislation (e.g. on procurement,&#13;
resettlement, axle loads); overly centralized decision making often causing delays in&#13;
prompt action; inadequate counterpart funds; and scarcity of qualified and experienced&#13;
staff. Various cross-sector and sector initiatives by bilateral and international donors such&#13;
as EDI-training courses, assistance with drafting legislation on procurement, resettlement&#13;
and other matters, economic and sector work, as well as reforms being undertaken by the&#13;
Government itself, are underway to resolve these general problems. The necessary changes&#13;
require time and it is clear that it will take some time to build up Vietnam's project&#13;
absorption capacity. Therefore, substantial outside assistance will be needed for the interim&#13;
period.&#13;
1.12      Difficulties with the implementation of the Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
have occurred due to slow, multi-layered and centralized decision making process. The&#13;
project management unit (PMU 1) is under-budgeted as well as understaffed, and it is still&#13;
short of the full range of skills required for the efficient and effective processing of the&#13;
Project. In addition, implementation has been slow due to earlier differences between the&#13;
Government and IDA on the resettlement policies related to project affected persons,&#13;
coordination difficulties between different levels of government and the inexperience of&#13;
local staff charged with the implementation of the resettlement action plan. However,&#13;
prior to appraisal, these resettlement issues were resolved and the project is implementing&#13;
smoothly. As resettlement activities under the ongoing project approach the final stages,&#13;
increasing competency of PMU1 staff and stronger commitment by Government to&#13;
mutually agreed goals and objectives can be noted in the way resettlement activities are&#13;
being carried out. Independent monitoring has shown that reorganized PAPs are satisfied&#13;
with their entitlements and have already restored their income and living standards.&#13;
Finally, there is some reluctance on the part of government authorities to use Credit funds&#13;
earmarked for technical assistance designed to address some of the sector wide problems&#13;
mentioned above. A team of consultants, financed by the proceeds of the Credit, has only&#13;
recently started its assistance to PMU I and it is expected that the "teething problems" of&#13;
the unit's functioning will gradually be eliminated. The Government is also moving to&#13;
resolve the resettlement, budget and staffing issues. Budgetary concerns on the cost of&#13;
resettlement led to the adoption of a non-cash alternative for creation of new assets which&#13;
is now being offered to affected people. IDA is continuing its discussions with&#13;
Government to unblock technical assistance funds available under the Credit for training,&#13;
studies and other purposes.&#13;

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. The Road Network and Traffic&#13;
2.1       Road Network. Vietnam's public road network consists of about 106,000 km&#13;
of roads classified as national roads (12,462 km), provincial roads (16,054 km), district&#13;
roads (21,928 km), viilage roads (46,910 km), urban roads (3,211 km) and special roads&#13;
(5,451 km). The national and provincial roads, which together carry the bulk of the road&#13;
traffic in the country, comprise 30% of the total network and of which only 14% is paved.&#13;
(Table 2.1). Average road density is rather low at 0.32 km/sq km of land area and 1.6&#13;
km/1000 inhabitants. Density in the two main deltas is considerably higher, while the&#13;
lowest densities occur in the highlands along the borders with Lao P.D.R. and China.&#13;
Some mountainous areas are still inaccessible by road.&#13;

2.2       Road Condition. Most of the roads are old. In the north, they were built&#13;
before 1954 and in the south little construction occurred after 1970. While geometric&#13;
standards are generally appropriate, construction standards are low, pavement conditions&#13;
are usually poor and road furniture is scarce and in poor condition. A survey2 in 1991 of&#13;
some 4,900 km of national roads showed that 9% were in good condition, 24% in fair and&#13;
67% in poor or very poor condition (Table 2.2). The north-south spine road, Highway 1,&#13;
is generally in fair, although rapidly deteriorating condition (55% fair and 19% poor),&#13;
while the other national roads surveyed in the north were in much worse condition than&#13;
those surveyed in the south, with poor and very poor ratings of 61 % and 30%,&#13;
respectively. This variation is mostly due to the difference in the type of construction&#13;
used, with penetration macadam pavements in the north and asphalt concrete surfacing on&#13;
crushed stone or stabilized base courses in the south. The condition of the lower class of&#13;
roads is generally very poor with a high proportion that are impassable during rains.&#13;

2.3        According to GOV statistics, there are about 8,160 bridges with a total length&#13;
of 168 km on the road network; giving the average length of a bridge as 20.6 m. The&#13;
condition of these bridges is generally unknown, except for 2,220 km of Highway 1&#13;
surveyed in 1991 which revealed that the bridges were in worse condition than the road.&#13;
In the north, over one third of the bridges were built as temporary structures, while in the&#13;
south, some 50% are temporary and in need of upgrading, rehabilitation or replacement.&#13;
Also, a few bridges on main roads serve rail as well as road traffic but are only one lane&#13;
wide; thus they cause major delays. Many of the bridges in fair condition are old and&#13;
designed for low loads; therefore, they will not support vehicles over 10 tons gross&#13;
weight. An ODA (UK) financed study is currently underway to survey and evaluate major&#13;
bridges on the national road network and build local capacity for bridge maintenance&#13;
management.&#13;
2.4        Motor Vehicle Fleet. It is estimated there were about 333,000 motor vehicles&#13;
registered in Vietnam in 1995 (excluding about 2.9 million motorcycles, 24,000 three-&#13;
wheelers, and military vehicles). Buses and trucks accounted for 56,600 (17%) and&#13;
119,700 (36%) respectively and passenger cars for 156,300 (Table 2.3).3 Vehicle density&#13;
is low at 4.6 motor vehicles/1,000 inhabitants but typical for a country at Vietnam's level&#13;
of development. While the number of passenger cars is low, two-wheeled vehicles (both&#13;
bicycles and motor cycles) are extensively used for passenger travel and for carrying small&#13;
amounts of cargo. This is especially true in the cities, but also on interurban roads. In the&#13;
north, motorcycles account for about a third of two-wheeled traffic, while in the Mekong&#13;
Delta, they account for about two thirds. The little historical data available show the&#13;
motorized vehicle fleet growing very slowly between 1988 and 1990 when the average&#13;
annual increase was about 3.5%, roughly in line with GDP growth. This growth rate has&#13;
3 It should be noted that the vehicles registered are not necessarily identical with the number of vehicles in service,&#13;
since there are reasons to believe that the statistics contain a number of vehicles which have been taken out of&#13;
service, but which are still registered. Thus, there might be an upward bias in the reported stock of vehicles.&#13;
&#13;

nearly doubled to about 7.0% p.a. during the period 1991-1995, thus surpassing GDP&#13;
growth.&#13;

2.5       Traffic Volumes. Average daily traffic (ADT) on the road network varies&#13;
considerably between and within regions, from negligible in the outlying highlands to&#13;
about 21,000 four-wheel vehicles per day around HCMC (1994/95). The highest&#13;
volumes occur on the approach roads to HCMC and Hanoi where road capacity problems&#13;
are already apparent. Compounding the capacity problem is the very high number of&#13;
slow moving motorcycles, bicycles (up to 39,000 per day near the largest cities) and&#13;
animal-drawn carts. Special attention needs to be given to this slow moving traffic in the&#13;
design of capacity-increasing measures. In addition, major roads are regularly used as&#13;
drying grounds for agricultural produce and vendors of produce and services encroach on&#13;
the shoulders and pavement in many areas - significantly reducing capacity and causing&#13;
traffic hazards. The road designs for the proposed project take into account these factors&#13;
and provide hard shoulders for separation of bicycle traffic, make adequate provision for&#13;
pedestrian movement and crossings and provide specifically constructed roadside drying&#13;
areas for agricultural products.&#13;
B. Road Transport Industry&#13;
2.6       Structure. Of the approximately 120,000 trucks in Vietnam about 73% belong&#13;
to cooperatives, joint ventures or the Government -- either the Ministry of Transport&#13;
(MOT), which operates commercial haulage fleets in the north, or other ministries&#13;
(including the military), which usually carry goods on "own account," supplemented,&#13;
sometimes, with commercial haulage. The private sector accounts for 27% of all trucks&#13;
and 15% of capacity. Almost all private operators have only one vehicle. Similarly about&#13;
a third of the bus fleet is owned and operated by the private sector while the remaining&#13;
two-thirds is either state owned or owned by cooperatives and joint ventures.&#13;
2.7       As funds for new vehicles are scarce, the truck and bus fleets are aging; almost&#13;
one third of the truck fleet and some 44% of the bus fleet is estimated to be over 10 years&#13;
old. Recently some used buses were acquired for city transport with French assistance.&#13;
2.8       Prices. Road freight transport remains the most expensive transport mode.&#13;
The schedule of freight tariffs established in 1993 ranges from 333 Dong/t-km for river&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
transport to 782 D/t-km by truck and 75 D/t-km by coastal shipping. However, these&#13;
tariffs calculated by TESI on the basis of vehicle operating costs, are only indicative and&#13;
mainly applied by state owned enterprises. In principle, the consignor is free to negotiate&#13;
the rates with the transport operator.&#13;
2.9      Passenger fares are normally subject to provincial control, but enforcement is&#13;
poor, particularly for intermediate journeys. Passenger boardings at bus stations are&#13;
normally charged the official rate (110, 100 and 80 Dong per passenger/km for north,&#13;
center and south, respectively, in 1994); otherwise, fares tend to become a matter of&#13;
negotiation between passengers and vehicle crews. Minibuses and shared taxis are&#13;
entitled to collect higher fares than big buses, reflecting shorter waiting times and quicker&#13;
journeys.&#13;
2.10     Performance. Trucks are heavily loaded and overloading by 25%-50% for&#13;
light and medium goods vehicles is common. Trucks cover an estimated average of about&#13;
42,000 km/year at an average speed of 30 km/hour and an average loaded/empty ratio of&#13;
about 59%. There are virtually no major constraints on vehicle availability, since owners&#13;
have an incentive to keep vehicles on the road. Spares can normally be obtained and&#13;
workshops, although not well equipped, are able to undertake most repairs. However,&#13;
due to the age and general condition of the fleet, breakdowns are frequent and down-&#13;
times are long, causing low utilization rates and requiring a significantly higher number&#13;
of vehicles than in many other countries.&#13;
2.11     Buses outside the urban areas are well loaded with average occupancy of&#13;
about 80% of seating capacity. Average annual utilization in 1994 was estimated at about&#13;
57,000 km/year. Availability is low, typically about 60%-65%. Private operators are&#13;
licensed by route, but this is not strictly enforced. In the south, they are involved in local&#13;
services and long distance transport. Provincial transport enterprises are required to serve&#13;
all main routes.&#13;
C. Institutional Framework&#13;
2.12     Ministry of Transport. At the national level, the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications (MOT) is responsible for constructing, maintaining and operating&#13;
highways, railways, inland waterways and ports (except for a few specialized ports such as&#13;
those dealing with coal and petroleum). Its basic structure and functions are presented in&#13;
Chart 1. MOT has been divided into two main groups: One set of departments is&#13;
categorized as "non-productive" and the other set is categorized as "productive." The&#13;
former set includes functional departments such as those responsible for planning,&#13;
investment, finance, etc.; individual and separate modal administrations (or departments)&#13;
responsible for highways, railways, waterways and ports; institutions which act as advisors&#13;
and also the research and design arm of the Ministry, which includes the research Institute&#13;
for Transportation, Science and Technology, the Transport Development Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Institute (TDSI, formerly known as TESI), the Transport Engineering Design Incorporated&#13;
(TEDI), as well as a number of vocational schools. The second set of departments&#13;
includes eight construction corporations responsible for large works, including major&#13;
repairs and capital construction. These construction corporations fall directly under the&#13;
responsibility of the Minister. The division into specific groupings is relatively new&#13;
(1992) and although the functions of the various departments appear to be clear, the lines&#13;
of responsibility between and among them remain less so. For example, under the new&#13;
organization, there are five distinctly separate Vice-Ministers responsible for economic&#13;
matters, capital construction, transportation, science and technology and southern&#13;
Vietnam, each of which has cross-departmental responsibilities. However, as the&#13;
structures mature and elements are fine-tuned, some of the anomalies are expected to&#13;
disappear. In addition, MOT also controls the state truck, barge and shipping companies&#13;
and port operations, and regulates own-account road and river transport, as well as a few&#13;
locally licensed enterprises engaged in transport for-hire nationwide.&#13;
2.13     Vietnam Road Administration. One of the major changes resulting from&#13;
MOT's reorganization in recent times is the introduction of modal administrations which&#13;
will be responsible for each of the major transport modes. Thus, the new Vietnam Road&#13;
Administration (VRA) was established in January 1993 (Decree 07-CP) as a department&#13;
directly subordinate to the Minister (Chart 2). VRA has a substantial degree of&#13;
autonomy and broad powers. It has its own legal status, accounts with the State Treasury&#13;
and its own budget which is reviewed by MOT and subrnitted to the Prime Minister for&#13;
approval. Its role and responsibilities encompass the five key road administration tasks,&#13;
namely: policy formulation, planning, guidance, control and execution.4&#13;
2.14      Regional Road Management Units. Reporting to the chief executive of VRA&#13;
are four Regional Road Management Units (RRMUs 2,4,5,7) of enterprises (first&#13;
established in 1982 and reorganized in 1992), which are responsible for maintaining 5,275&#13;
km of the national road network, and partially responsible for maintaining provincial&#13;
roads and bridges in the various provinces and urban centers of the regions. In addition,&#13;
they manage vocational schools concerned with roads, and health clinics for their&#13;
personnel. RRMU 2 (Hanoi) is responsible for the northern part of the country; RRMU 4&#13;
(Vinh) for the northern part of central Vietnam; RRMU 5 (Da Nang) for the southern part&#13;
of central Vietnam and RRMU 7 (HCMC) for the southern part of the country. The&#13;
RRMUs are in transition, with each restructuring its respective organizations according to&#13;
the latest directives from MOT. Each RRMU is responsible for a portion of the national&#13;
road network in its geographic area, and employs on average about 2,500 people (Table&#13;
2.4). Sub-RRMUs are given responsibilities for repair and maintenance of about 150-250&#13;
km of road each. These in turn are divided up into gang-sized sections of 30-50 km of&#13;

road. Responsibility for major construction projects, previously assigned to the RRMUs,&#13;
has now been transferred to new construction corporations, who report directly to MOT&#13;
and are grouped into 14 regional units, each consisting of 10-20 enterprises which are&#13;
specialized in certain activities (road construction, bridge construction etc.). These&#13;
construction corporations are meant to compete with one another, mainly on projects for&#13;
the provinces or for MOT. Most, however, are still closely linked in their region to the&#13;
RRMU from which they originated. Chart 3 shows a typical organizational structure of an&#13;
RRMU.&#13;

2.15       Proiect Management Units. Major road projects involving substantial&#13;
expenditures or the use of high technology are assigned a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) dedicated to that project or a group of related projects. PMUs come under the&#13;
direct control of MOT, but in many instances draw on VRA staff for the duration of the&#13;
project(s). There are currently five PMUs set up for projects financed by foreign sources&#13;
(Table 2.5).&#13;

2.16       Provincial Departments of Transport (PDOTs). The PDOTs, also known as the&#13;
Provincial Transport Authorities (PTAs), report to the local People's Committees and are&#13;
responsible for implementing transport plans, for applying uniform standards for road&#13;
works and for managing transport assets at the provincial level. Their functions include&#13;
planning, regulation and control of transport infrastructure and operations at the provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
level. They also have holdings in provincial transport enterprises. The PDOT's sources&#13;
of funds include transfers from central government through the Ministry of Finance, the&#13;
MOT for any national roads assigned to their care, allocations from the People's&#13;
Committee, a portion of revenues derived from taxes and charges collected at the&#13;
provincial level and revenues from their own commercial operations. Similar&#13;
arrangements apply at the District level (the DTOTs).&#13;
D. Expenditure and Financing&#13;
2.17     Road Sector Expenditure. The information on expenditure in the road sector&#13;
is incomplete since only the expenditure of the central government, through its own&#13;
spending entities or through local governments, is known. Since local governments have&#13;
little revenue raising powers themselves the central Government is either directly or&#13;
indirectly responsible for the lion's share of capital and current expenditure on roads. An&#13;
important means of local road funding is direct contribution, in cash and in kind, of the&#13;
local population. For example, the Government estimates that during the period 1991-95&#13;
the contribution of the local population for the upgrading of rural and village roads&#13;
amounted to about US$200 million, equivalent to 52% of the total expenditure for rural&#13;
roads in that period.&#13;
2.18     The GOV's transport expenditure for 1993 and 1994 is shown in Table 2.6.&#13;
Among the different transport modes, roads received by far the largest share in spending,&#13;
both in terms of capital and current expenditure. Furthermore, both types of road&#13;
expenditure increased substantially. In 1994 capital expenditure increased by 82% from&#13;
the previous year and current expenditure by 47% to VND 2,456 billion and VND 513&#13;
billion respectively, in acceleration of a trend that started around 1992. It is interesting to&#13;
note that a substantial part of the available resources is spent by local government entities.&#13;
Until 1993 central government capital expenditure was low compared with the capital&#13;
expenditure of local entities and central government current expenditure was only slightly&#13;
higher. A shift in emphasis occurred in 1994 when central capital expenditure for roads&#13;
became more important with the start of major road rehabilitation on the national road&#13;
network. This trend is expected to accelerate as major works on highway 1 and other&#13;
national highways are carried out. As regards current expenditure, local entities spent&#13;
between 30%-40% of the total in 1993 and 1994.&#13;
2.19     Capital expenditure on roads in 1990 was about VND270 million increasing to&#13;
VND 3.0 billion in 1995. This represents an increase from 0.4% of GDP in 1990 to 1.2%&#13;
of GDP in 1995, or 2.3% of total government expenditure in 1990 to 5.0% in 1995. The&#13;
projected capital expenditure is about VND 5.9 billion in 1996, rising to VND 7.1 billion&#13;
in 2000 (Annex 2.1).&#13;

2.20        Until 1995 the major part of road expenditure was financed from domestic&#13;
sources, i.e. from the budget through taxes and state credit. In future, the Government&#13;
expects to fund up to 90% of capital expenditure through lending by foreign bilateral or&#13;
multilateral sources as well as some (limited) foreign direct investment. Current&#13;
expenditure is almost entirely funded from domestic resources.&#13;
2.21        Road User Charges. Vietnam applies a wide range of road-user charges.&#13;
These include charges that are (a) purchase related (import duties on new vehicles, and&#13;
ownership transfer taxes when vehicles change hands); (b) ownership related (annual&#13;
registration fees) and (c) use related (import duties on spare parts, tires and lubricants).&#13;
Furthermore, the pump price of fuel used in road transport is taxed by means of an&#13;
import tax at 55% per ton for gasoline and 20% per ton for diesel as well as a "luxury"&#13;
tax introduced in January 1996 set at 15% per liter of the after tax import CIF price of&#13;
gasoline and of imported vehicles. In addition, the Government introduced in January&#13;
1995 a surcharge on fuel used in road transport (traffic fee) whose purpose is, according&#13;
to Decree No.186-CP of December 7, 1994, "to generate funds for the regular repair and&#13;
maintenance of the transport system in the whole country." Steps have been initiated by&#13;
Government to set up a Road Fund to which these funds would be dedicated for road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
maintenance (para. 2.25). Annex 2.2 provides details of the structure of road user&#13;
charges.&#13;
2.22     Although it is difficult to estimate the specific contribution (i.e.over and above&#13;
general taxation levels) of road transport to government revenue because of unreliable&#13;
statistical data for fuel imports, fuel consumption, vehicle imports and a number of other&#13;
variables. Thus, depending on the source and the method of estimation, the range is&#13;
believed to be between US$ 244 (GSO data) million and US$ 477 million per year&#13;
(consultants' data). Using estimates of the TSR and updating them to reflect increases in&#13;
traffic, vehicle ownership (notably motorcycles) and the changes in the taxation regime the&#13;
likely revenue from road traffic in 1995 is estimated at about US$ 370 million, of which&#13;
about US$ 90 million would be raised by the new transport fee, US$ 83 million through&#13;
import duties and taxes on spare parts, and the remainder through fuel taxes.&#13;
2.23     Cost Recovery. The total revenue collected from road users each year since&#13;
1991 has exceeded by a substantial margin the resources allocated to recurrent road&#13;
maintenance expenditure (O&amp;M). In fact, the revenue collected in 1995 from road users&#13;
would have been more than sufficient to fund the estimated requirements for O&amp;M of&#13;
US$230 million equivalent and still have left a considerable amount for contribution to&#13;
the general budget. Thus, the issue does not seem to be a lack of adequate revenue from&#13;
road users but rather the claims of other sectors of Government on these resources. Since&#13;
funding for road O&amp;M has increased dramatically over the last two years is evidence that&#13;
the Government is beginning to address the problem and to correct it.&#13;
E. Highway Sector Issues&#13;
2.24     Road Maintenance. The inadequacy of road maintenance can be traced to two&#13;
main problems: inadequate planning and minimal funding. Despite recent substantial&#13;
increases, highway maintenance is still underfunded and execution is substandard, resulting&#13;
in a loss of productivity, excessive vehicle operating costs and ultimately inefficient use of&#13;
scarce resources. Deficiencies include technical matters and personnel policies and span&#13;
the whole spectrum of planning, programming, budgeting, design, execution, supervision&#13;
and monitoring. Although in theory the agencies concerned with roads should prepare five-&#13;
year and annual road maintenance plans, the lack of funds make systematic planning&#13;
meaningless and in practice only one-year plans are prepared. But as Vietnam's experience&#13;
has amply shown, the planning and funding problems are closely related since road&#13;
management systems cannot be successful unless enough funding is secured for&#13;
maintenance. Hence, both issues need to be dealt with simultaneously.&#13;
2.25     Until recently, maintenance expenditures for national roads amounted to about&#13;
25% - 30% of needs, indicating that most of the network was not maintained. However,&#13;
the Government is beginning to correct the underfunding problem. For example, in 1995&#13;
its allocation for maintenance is estimated to have amounted to about 50% of the funding&#13;
required for national, provincial and district roads in that year. Furthermore, MOT has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
proposed setting up a Road Fund to be financed from the transport fees levied on fuel and&#13;
from other road user charges. The proposal has been agreed in principle by Government.&#13;
2.26     Maintenance of the main trunk roads, such as Highway 1, is intensive but of&#13;
low quality, which, together with initially weak construction, results in excessive road&#13;
roughness. Further, the process of allocating and distributing funds is complex and&#13;
cumbersome. MPI and MOF issue budget guidelines and targets, while the RRMUs and&#13;
provincial departments submit reports on needs; VRA and the Department of Planning in&#13;
MOT finalize the maintenance budget for national roads, comment on the one for&#13;
provincial roads, and secure MOF approvals. The release of funds, once these are&#13;
allocated, is often delayed, causing difficulties in execution. However, since 1992, a&#13;
system of advance disbursement has been introduced with some success.&#13;
2.27     Execution of maintenance is largely by force account and highly labor&#13;
intensive. The quality of work can be improved through provision of good standards and&#13;
specifications for all maintenance activities. Also, equipment is mostly old, in poor&#13;
condition and inappropriate and there is inadequate supervision and monitoring. Several&#13;
measures to improve rcutine maintenance are being provided under the on-going first&#13;
highway project. These include technical assistance to the RRMUs to improve the&#13;
planning, programming, budgeting, designing and execution of maintenance operations;&#13;
provision of equipment; and training of personnel. There is further need for modernizing&#13;
the equipment stock and introducing competitive contracting methods for periodic&#13;
maintenance and training of road agencies and domestic contractors in contract&#13;
administration, management and supervision (para 3.8).&#13;
2.28     Regulations. Various studies commissioned by the Government have identified&#13;
inadequate regulation of heavy vehicles as a major problem because virtually all the&#13;
pavement wear and structural damage of roads is caused by the overloading of heavy&#13;
vehicles. Rules/regulations on vehicle weight and dimensions are outdated and&#13;
inadequate. The limits are overly restrictive, although the reverse tends to be true of limits&#13;
and rules relating to vehicle safety features and conditions. No limits exist for axle loads,&#13;
but those for gross vehicle weight are only 13 tons and 16 tons for semi-trailers; this&#13;
indicates a limit of eight tons for a single axle, while a limit of 10 tons would be more&#13;
reasonable. The vehicle height limit of 3.5 meters precludes the legal movement of ISO&#13;
containers on a conventional chassis. However, containers appear to move freely on roads&#13;
near the major ports, probably on the basis of exemptions granted by MOT. The overall&#13;
problem is compounded by ambiguities and omissions in the assignment of responsibilities&#13;
for enforcement. Under an ADB financed project, consultants are reviewing the&#13;
institutional and legal arrangements for managing the road sector including development&#13;
of appropriate traffic regulations.&#13;
2.29     Road User Charges. After the recent introduction of the transport fee on fuel&#13;
used in road transport it appears that the level of road user charges is now adequate.&#13;
However, the remaining distortions which should be eliminated concern the structure of&#13;
road user charges. Various studies (TSR; Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick; N.D. Lea) have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
concluded that diesel fuel and heavy vehicles are taxed rather low and that this amounts to&#13;
an indirect subsidy to diesel powered heavy vehicles and provides no fiscal incentive to&#13;
users of heavy vehicles to utilize vehicles with sufficient axles that (in conjunction with&#13;
axle load limits) would help reduce substantially the wear and tear on the roads and thus&#13;
preserve the Government's investment. The studies recommended to raise the fuel tax on&#13;
diesel vehicles to the level of the gasoline tax and, in addition, to introduce specific&#13;
charges designed to reflect the equivalent standard axles (ESAs) of heavy vehicles and&#13;
thus the damage they inflict on pavements. MOT is currently reviewing these&#13;
recommendations. With regard to diesel taxes the Government has recently introduced&#13;
some small (but still insufficient) modifications in the context of IDA's first structural&#13;
adjustment credit. This issue should be further reviewed in IDA's macro-economic&#13;
dialogue with the Government with a view to reduce the gap even more. As regards axle&#13;
load charges it would be appropriate for MOT to consider the consultants'&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
2.30      Resettlement. The Government has laws and regulations to guide MOT's&#13;
"clearance" of people from the right of way of public roads. These do not necessarily&#13;
conform to Bank's policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The Government appears to&#13;
recognize that a new and comprehensive policy aligned to the requirements of the&#13;
multilateral agencies needs to be established and has obtained from the Bank (through an&#13;
IDF grant) assistance to develop its national policy on resettlement. However, preparing&#13;
and reaching agreement with Government on a comprehensive policy and the associated&#13;
implementation procedures, acceptable to IDA for all sectors, could take about two years.&#13;
Therefore, in the interim, resolution of the present differences need to be on the basis of&#13;
specifically prepared Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) satisfactory to IDA, including&#13;
project specific resettlement policies, guidelines for implementation and Government's&#13;
commitment to compensate the already affected persons on the project road sections.&#13;
2.31      Traffic Safety. Since 1990, traffic accidents and fatalities in Vietnam have&#13;
doubled and injuries tripled. According to the statistics collected by the Traffic Police,&#13;
13,118 accidents claimed 4,533 lives and 13,586 injuries on roads in 1994. The fatality&#13;
rate - number of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles - is amounting to about 13.0.&#13;
Notwithstanding the differences in composition of vehicle fleets, this rate is the highest&#13;
among the neighboring countries (e.g. Thailand 12.1, Malaysia 8.0, and Philippines 9.0),&#13;
and around six times higher than rates in the developed countries (Japan 1.8, Australia&#13;
2.3, Norway 2.0, and Sweden 2.0). The numbers are, however, thought to be much&#13;
higher since accident data are neither accurate nor complete in Vietnam. Under-reporting&#13;
is acknowledged by the Traffic Police to be very severe.&#13;
2.32      The factors responsible for the high accident rate include inappropriate design&#13;
of some road segments, poor vehicle condition, unsafe driver behavior, but most&#13;
importantly the broad mix of vehicles on roads. Although the 1994 Traffic Police Report&#13;
determined improper driving is the greatest cause for accidents, which is said to be&#13;
because of the inadequate driver education, scarce driving discipline and use of alcohol,&#13;
broad mix of vehicles on roads is actually creating the dangerous exposure to accidents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
This traffic condition on roads is aggravating the traffic safety situation on the roads--the&#13;
high number of old trucks and buses mixed with the high number of motorcycles and&#13;
non-motorized vehicles. About 50% of all accidents occurred on the national highways,&#13;
30% on urban roads and 20% on rural roads. Broad mix of vehicles is most serious on&#13;
the national highways where trucks and buses run with high speeds along with the non-&#13;
motorized vehicles that are moving slowly on the same lanes.&#13;
2.33     The Government has taken significant actions to address these problems.&#13;
Decree 104/QD-2B was issued in 1991 jointly by the MOT and Ministry of Industry&#13;
(MOI) to establish the National Traffic Safety Committee (NTSC). This is followed by&#13;
the establishment of the Traffic Safety Department in the VRA. MOT took a further&#13;
action and declared 1995 as "National Traffic Safety Year". The NTSC is authorized to&#13;
draw up the plans to implement traffic safety measures and traffic safety education&#13;
programs. It produces an annual plan and submits it to the Prime Minister through the&#13;
MPI an MOF. However, since the budget has been very limited and been used only to&#13;
implement publicity and education programs, no physical improvement of roads has been&#13;
included in the safety plan. At present the NTSC has no formal technical support&#13;
organization although such support is needed. The Traffic Safety Department in VRA is&#13;
still in an infant stage and has only six staff; thus, it needs to be strengthened so that it will&#13;
be able to provide technical advice to the NTSC.&#13;
2.34     Under the first Highway Rehabilitation Project (HRP1), a study on road safety&#13;
issues is to be carried out and a road safety action plan is to be developed. The initial&#13;
phase of the safety action plan would be funded under the ongoing project and would&#13;
include strengthening of institutions that are concerned with road safety such as the Traffic&#13;
Police, the Traffic Safety Department in VRA and the RRMUs. The institutional&#13;
strengthening would be focused on an improved accident data system, educational&#13;
programs and a multi-media public awareness campaign. A component to improve&#13;
hazardous locations on selected national roads (high accident sections) that are to be&#13;
identified in the road safety action plan is included in the proposed project (para. 3.10).&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.1      The ability of Vietnam's economy to respond to market incentives depends to a&#13;
large degree on well-functioning infrastructure, such as the power and transport systems.&#13;
Thus, Government's strategy is to have public investment programs focus on rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of basic infrastructure. It has therefore identified rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of the existing highway system as one of the country's most urgent needs.&#13;
This is consistent with Bank's long-term objective in Vietnam to promote broad-based and&#13;
sustainable development that results in a rapid reduction in poverty. The Bank, ADB,&#13;
Japan and other bilateral donors are collaborating to rehabilitate the entire trunk road from&#13;
China in the north to the Gulf of Thailand in the south. IDA is particularly well suited to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
assist GOV in coordinating broad donor support in this regard and the proposed project&#13;
will be part of this joint effort.&#13;
3.2      IDA's involvement in the project is also consistent with Bank's country&#13;
assistance strategy (CAS; October 25, 1995, updated October 1996) of supporting the&#13;
transition to a market economy, strengthening sector institutions and assisting Government&#13;
to plan and finance infrastructure development. The proposed project is a continuation of&#13;
the rehabilitation of Highway 1, the country's most important arterial highway connecting&#13;
Hanoi with Ho Chi Minh City. The provinces traversed by the project road are now&#13;
mainly agricultural and among the poorest in the nation. The improved highway is&#13;
expected to open up these provinces to industrial activities (agribusiness and light&#13;
industries) and to improve farmers' access to regional markets. Thus, the project will form&#13;
an important element in Government's strategy to improve the living conditions of the&#13;
rural population. Furthermore, the project would help introduce modem road building and&#13;
road maintenance technologies and management methods; re-design essential elements of&#13;
the highway to cater for non-motorized transport; strengthen highway management&#13;
institutions; implement pilot programs to introduce modern road maintenance contracting&#13;
and management methods; improve traffic safety and control vehicle overloading. Thus,&#13;
consistent with the CAS, IDA's role goes beyond the specific investment proposed, and&#13;
includes the longer term development of sector institutions, policies, and human resource&#13;
(through technical assistance and training).&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.3      The broader developmental goal of the proposed project is to raise overall&#13;
economic efficiency and support economic and social development of the country through&#13;
an improved transport infrastructure. The specific project objectives are to:&#13;
(a) reduce transport costs through improved national road infrastructure,&#13;
particularly, Highway No. 1;&#13;
(b) enhance efficiency of the road sector institutions in periodic maintenance of&#13;
the national road network;&#13;
(c) reduce vehicle overloading and improve traffic safety;&#13;
(d) enhance institutional capacity of MOT in environmental impact assessment&#13;
and monitoring.&#13;
3.4       Perfornance Indicators. To measure performance of the project with regard to&#13;
achieving its stated objectives, key indicators will be monitored during implementation&#13;
and after completion (see para. 3.43). The key indicators are: (i) reduced vehicle operating&#13;
costs (VOCs); (ii) reduced tariffs for transport of passengers and goods in real terms; (iii)&#13;
increased travel speed; (iv) increase in volume of periodic maintenance undertaken by&#13;
competitive bidding; (v) reduction in incidence of overloaded vehicles; (vi) reduction in&#13;
accidents and number of fatalities; (vii) production and use of guidelines for EIA of road&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.5      The project will comprise the following components:&#13;
(a) Road Reconstruction and Rehabilitation&#13;
(b) Periodic Maintenance of Selected Priority National Roads&#13;
(c) Improvement of Hazardous Road Sections&#13;
(d) Support to PMU 1&#13;
(e) Support to VRA and RRMUs&#13;
(f) Training&#13;
(g) Detailed Design and Engineering Studies&#13;
3.6      Road Reconstruction and Rehabilitation: This component includes&#13;
reconstruction of the Vinh-Dong Ha section (292 km) of the National Highway No. 1;&#13;
reconstruction of two major bridges at Chanh Hoa (90 m) and Quan Hau (500 m); land&#13;
acquisition; resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected people (including those&#13;
already affected by the enforcement of Decree 36/CP dated August 1, 1995 on road safety&#13;
in the project segments of the highway); and provision of supervision consultant services.&#13;
3.7      Road reconstruction will be carried out along the existing alignment with&#13;
minimum widening of road embankment where the existing width is not enough for a 7m&#13;
pavement and two 1.5m shoulders. The road embankments will be raised where necessary&#13;
to provide adequate protection against a ten-year flood (with overtopping not to exceed&#13;
30 cm), and the drainage structures will be improved or replaced to provide efficient&#13;
drainage of storm water. The pavement will consist largely of a crushed stone base and&#13;
asphalt concrete surface of varying thickness. Plans are well underway by MOT to&#13;
reconstruct the two major bridges at Chanh Hoa and Quan Hau, using government funds.&#13;
Construction of these two bridges is expected to be completed within the project period.&#13;
3.8      Periodic Maintenance of Selected Priority National Roads. Due to budget&#13;
constraints, MOT has been giving a higher priority to reconstruction and recurrent&#13;
maintenance compared to periodic maintenance. This component is aimed at initiating a&#13;
program of systematic periodic maintenance of national highways by contract. About 950&#13;
km of high priority national road sections (including eligible sections of Highway No. 1&#13;
between Dong Ha and Quang Ngai) will be selected in accordance with the results of the&#13;
recently completed "Study of Investment and Maintenance Strategy for National and&#13;
Provincial Roads" financed by ODA, UK and the need for equitable geographic&#13;
distribution among different maintenance organizations. A tentative list of selected roads&#13;
is given in Annex 3.1. During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government&#13;
that roads for periodic maintenance will be selected in accordance with economic and&#13;
other criteria satisfactory to IDA. Because of wide geographic distribution, most of the&#13;
periodic maintenance contracts will be let on the basis of national competitive bidding&#13;
thus giving opportunity for domestic contractor development. Supervision consultant&#13;
services will be required to assist PMU 1, VRA and RRMUs in the preparation of bid&#13;
documents, contract administration, supervision of works, and training of local staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20-&#13;
3.9     In addition to meeting the urgent needs of periodic maintenance works, the&#13;
pilot program will implement the new road maintenance management system being&#13;
developed under the on-going first highway rehabilitation project.&#13;
3.10     Improvement of Hazardous Road Sections. To enhance traffic safety, selected&#13;
critical sections of national highways will be improved on the basis of the Vietnam Road&#13;
Safety Improvement Study to be conducted under the first highway rehabilitation project.&#13;
Measures to improve traffic safety will include provision of adequate road furniture, signs&#13;
and traffic management facilities. During negotiations, agreement was obtained from&#13;
Government that by June 30, 1998, it will prepare and furnish to IDA for its&#13;
concurrence, a list of critical sections of roads to be improved through safety&#13;
measures.&#13;
3.11     Support to PMU 1. The functions and responsibilities of PMU1 have grown&#13;
exponentially in the last four years. It is currently managing the entire program for&#13;
reconstruction of Highway No. 1 including rehabilitation of bridges. The program is&#13;
supported by ADB, Japan, DANIDA and other donor agencies under several on-going&#13;
and planned projects. The objective of this component is to further enhance the efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness of PMU1 to manage the highway projects. This will include purchase of&#13;
vehicles and office equipment, construction of an operating center, technical support for&#13;
project implementation, monitoring and evaluation (PIME) functions, operating cost,&#13;
training of staff and support for environmental impact assessment (Annex 3.2).&#13;
3.12     Support to VRA and RRMUs. To enhance institutional capacity, this&#13;
component includes provision of additional maintenance equipment for RRMUs and axle&#13;
load weighing stations and equipment for VRA (Annex 3.3).&#13;
3.13     Training. This component is aimed at improving the capability of the transport&#13;
sector training system through a program of training the trainers, strengthening of local&#13;
institutions and enhancing the skills of highway sector manpower in MOT, VRA, RRMUs,&#13;
PMU1 and other road design and research institutions through specialized training&#13;
programs. It includes short to medium term local and overseas courses on highway design,&#13;
construction and maintenance technology, construction management and traffic&#13;
engineering for managers and technical staff, study tours, and attendance at seminars,&#13;
workshops and conferences as outlined in part in an August 1996 consultant report on,&#13;
"MOT Highway Sector Retraining and Improvement Programs." During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was obtained from Government that no later than November 30 of each year,&#13;
commencing in 1997, it will furnish to IDA, for its concurrence the Borrower's&#13;
training program for its forthcoming fiscal year.&#13;
3.14     Detailed Design and Engineering Studies. IDA has obtained Japanese Grant&#13;
funds for a feasibility study of the southern segment of Highway No. 1, namely Can Tho-&#13;
Ca Mau - Nam Can. The study is expected to be commissioned by April 1997 and&#13;
completed by early 1998. To prepare a follow-up project with possible financing from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
IDA, this component includes detailed design and engineering study of Can Tho-Nam Can&#13;
road and portions of Dong Ha-Quang Ngai road section and detailed design and&#13;
preparation of bid documents for future periodic maintenance component. Annex 3.4 gives&#13;
a draft TOR for the design and engineering study which includes detailed measurement&#13;
and land surveys for detailed preparation of a resettlement action plan. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government that by June 30, 1998 a list of&#13;
roads to be included for periodic maintenance under a follow-up project would be&#13;
furnished to IDA for its review and concurrence.&#13;
3.15     The project has been designed to include only the minimum long term foreign&#13;
technical assistance for institutional strengthening (e.g. technical consultant services for&#13;
PMUI will consist only of about 20 man-months for project planning, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation). The remaining technical assistance is largely for implementation support&#13;
(supervision of civil works including periodic maintenance, amounting to 420 manmonths&#13;
of foreign and 630 man-months of local inputs) and for design and engineering study (120&#13;
man months of foreign and 240 man-months of local inputs). Annex 3.5 gives a brief&#13;
summary of the technical assistance and consultant services required.&#13;
3.16     In order to reverse the deterioration of road pavements and enhance traffic&#13;
safety, it is essential to keep vehicle and axle loads within reasonable limits. Under an&#13;
ADB financed project, international consultants have reviewed the institutional and legal&#13;
arrangements for managing the road sector including traffic regulations. The study was&#13;
completed in November 1996. During negotiations, agreement was obtained from&#13;
Government that by April 1, 1998, the recommendations of the study on vehicle&#13;
weights, dimensions and axle load limits would be reviewed jointly with IDA, and&#13;
thereafter action would be taken to enforce such recommendations.&#13;
3.17     To enhance donor coordination and ensure economic utilization of scarce&#13;
resources, it is essential for Government to hold annual reviews of its expenditure program&#13;
in the road sector jointly with IDA and other key donors. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was obtained from Government that by October 31 of each year, commencing in 1997, it&#13;
will review and agree jointly with IDA its annual expenditure program for the road sector&#13;
for the forthcoming Borrower's fiscal year. An understanding was reached that other&#13;
donors active in the road sector will be invited to participate in such reviews.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.18     The project is rated in Category B for environmental impact. The&#13;
environmental impact of the civil works will be minimal because the rehabilitation will be&#13;
carried out on the existing alignments. The engineering design and construction methods&#13;
include appropriate mitigating measures, such as, designing slopes of cuts and fills to&#13;
minimize potential for failure and erosion, provision of additional culverts to improve&#13;
drainage of surface runoff, and so on. For the most part, the project will benefit the&#13;
environment. Widening the roadway and improving the surface will reduce air and noise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
pollution and improve traffic safety. A detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA)&#13;
has been prepared for the project and any potential environmental consequences will be&#13;
taken into consideration during implementation of the project.&#13;
3.19     Vietnam has also taken steps to develop the framework and institutions for&#13;
environmental protection. The National Assembly has passed the law on Environmental&#13;
Protection (December 1993) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOSTE) has&#13;
issued a Decree providing guidance for implementation of the law. Furthermore,&#13;
Government is taking steps to strengthen the environmental monitoring institutions within&#13;
the country. Under the project, PMU 1 will establish a small unit, comprising two key&#13;
officials, responsible for overseeing environmental impact assessment studies and&#13;
monitoring implementation of environmental action plans. The officials will obtain training&#13;
in environment management and they will produce specific guidelines for EIA of road&#13;
projects. They will work in collaboration with MOT which is being assisted by CIDA&#13;
under a technical assistance program to strengthen its institutional capacity for dealing&#13;
with environmental issues.&#13;
3.20    Annex 3.6 gives a summary of the EIA and mitigation measures and cost&#13;
estimate for establishing the EIA monitoring unit. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
obtained from Government that an environmental unit comprising two officials will be&#13;
established in PMU 1 by December 31, 1997, and that adequate steps will be taken during&#13;
the design and construction phase, to mitigate any adverse environmental impact of the&#13;
project in accordance with the EIA and national guidelines.&#13;
E. Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
3.21     The road between Vinh and Dong Ha spans 292 km across a coastal plain in&#13;
the center of Vietnam. It crosses mainly rural areas dominated by rice production but&#13;
runs through several villages, rural residential areas and urban centers. The highway&#13;
passes through four provinces, 13 districts, 5 towns and 97 communes. The rehabilitation&#13;
of the road will be carried out largely on the existing alignment, minimizing land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement. The road will be widened to a minimum width of 7 m,&#13;
comprising of two lanes 3.5 m wide each. Paved shoulders 1.5 m or 2.5 m on either side&#13;
will be provided for bicycles, pedestrians and other very slow moving vehicles. For the&#13;
purpose of the project, a corridor of width ranging from 18 m (in district towns) to 30 m&#13;
(in rural areas susceptible to flooding ) has been established. This project corridor&#13;
includes the roadway, shoulders, side drains and a clear area of 3.0 - 5.0 m on each side of&#13;
the road in urban areas and 2.0 - 7.0 m in rural areas. The purpose of the clear area is to&#13;
enhance traffic safety and the safety of the population residing along the road. It also&#13;
provides for installation of under-ground infrastructure where needed. The project&#13;
corridor is confined within the Right-of Way (ROW), which constitutes in rural areas, the&#13;
area along the highway within 7 m from the toe of the embankment on either side, and in&#13;
urban areas, the areas defined as such in the respective Master Plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.22     Due to road widening, where required, and the clearing of encroachments&#13;
within the designated clear zone required for traffic and pedestrian safety, about 2,300&#13;
households (11,000 persons) are expected to be affected due to reorganization or&#13;
relocation of structures, 1,500 households (6,700 persons) due to acquisition of residential&#13;
land and about 4,500 households (20,000 persons) due to acquisition of agricultural land.&#13;
In total, about 8,300 households (37,700 persons) would be affected by the project. This&#13;
includes those already affected persons (AAPs) during implementation of government&#13;
Decree 36/CP (for traffic safety). A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared by MOT&#13;
with the assistance of consultants during the feasibility/engineering phase of the project&#13;
has been revised to include the AAPs (2,134 households) due to the implementation of the&#13;
Decree 36/CP, even if they were outside the road project corridor but within the ROW.&#13;
Annex 3.7 gives a brief summary of the resettlement action plan. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was obtained from Government that resettlement of project affected&#13;
people would be completed in accordance with the agreed RAP approved by GOV&#13;
including the AAPs time-bound action plan defined therein, and in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. Furthermore, to monitor the implementation, effectiveness and&#13;
socio-economic impact of resettlement, MOT would engage an independent monitoring&#13;
agency with qualified and experienced staff under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Conditions of credit effectiveness include: (a) satisfactory compensation and&#13;
rehabilitation of the AAPs in accordance with the RAP and the AAPs time-bound action&#13;
plan; and (b) hiring of an independent monitoring agency under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
F. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
3.23     The estimated total cost of the project is US$236.7 million (including taxes,&#13;
duties and contingencies) with a foreign exchange component of US$193.9 million or 82&#13;
percent of total project cost. Duties and taxes (including consultants' taxes) are estimated&#13;
at US$9.5 million (to be bome by the Borrower). Costs have been estimated at September&#13;
1995 prices and at an exchange rate of US$1.00 equals 11,000 Vietnamese dong. Costs&#13;
include physical contingencies estimated as 8% of the base cost of civil works and price&#13;
contingencies taken as 15% of total base cost calculated on the basis of expected rates of&#13;
foreign and local inflation. Foreign inflation is estimated as 2.3% per annum in the period&#13;
1996-2001, and local inflation is estimated as 9.0% in 1996, 7.0% in 1997, and 6.0% per&#13;
annum in 1998-2001.&#13;
3.24     IDA is expected to finance US$195.6 million equivalent, or 83% of the total&#13;
project cost (87% net of taxes and duties) of which approximately 88% is for civil works,&#13;
6% for implementation support and technical assistance, 3% for equipment and vehicles,&#13;
2% for studies and 1 % for training. The proposed IDA Credit would be funded under the&#13;
Interim Trust Fund (ITF) administered by IDA and subject to its special provisions&#13;
regarding procurement. The Government is expected to cover US$41.1 million equivalent&#13;
(17%) which includes full financing of the two major bridges (US$ 14.8 million). Based on&#13;
a review of its annual capital expenditure in the road sector, it is expected that GOV will&#13;
be able to mobilize the estimated US$6.6 million per annum (in addition to the US$14.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
million for the bridges) required in counterpart funds for the project. A summary of the&#13;
project cost and financing plan is given in Table 3.1 below and the details are shown in&#13;
Annex 3.8. During negotiations, Government agreement was obtained on the timely&#13;
provision of the necessary counterpart funds.&#13;

G. Project Implementation&#13;
3.25        The project is expected to be implemented within five years of inception&#13;
(including the 12 month maintenance liability period) and is tentatively scheduled for&#13;
completion by December 31, 2001. MOT would be responsible for overall project&#13;
execution through PMU 1 which would also provide oversight and supervision of contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
management, technical assistance, studies and training to be implemented by other&#13;
agencies. MOT would ensure that the PMU 1 is maintained at all times, headed by a&#13;
suitably qualified Manager and staffed by competent personnel in adequate numbers.&#13;
VRA (through the RRMUs) and relevant Provincial Departments of Transport (PDOTs)&#13;
would be responsible for implementing the periodic maintenance component except for&#13;
ICB contracts which would be executed directly by PMU 1 for MOT. PMU 1, VRA,&#13;
RRMUs and MOT would be supported by technical assistance as needed to enhance their&#13;
capacity to implement and monitor the project and to train counterpart staff. Due to the&#13;
unfamiliarity of VRA, RRMUs and PDOTs with IDA procedures and guidelines for&#13;
implementing projects, PMU1 will train the relevant staff by incorporating them into&#13;
PMU1 for the first year of the program and assist them in preparing and carrying out the&#13;
initial part of the periodic maintenance program. Supervision consultants will be retained&#13;
by and report directly to PMU 1. As the executing agency for the project, disbursement of&#13;
funds and financial accounting would be the responsibility of PMU 1 for the entire project&#13;
with the exception of the construction of the two major bridges which will be managed by&#13;
MOT through one of its other PMUs.&#13;
3.26     A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) giving specific details of the project&#13;
components; cost estimates; implementation schedules including start of bidding,&#13;
evaluation of bids and proposals, award and execution of contracts under ICB and NCB;&#13;
schedules for technical assistance and studies; terms of reference for consultant services;&#13;
performance indicators and monitorable targets; etc. has been prepared by GOV with&#13;
IDA's assistance. A summary of the project implementation and procurement plan which&#13;
provides the baseline against which progress will be monitored is given in Annex 3.9.&#13;
H. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.27     Project preparation is well advanced. Engineering designs have been&#13;
completed for the rehabilitation of the 292 km Vinh-Dong Ha road section and the draft&#13;
tender documents have been prepared. Invitation to contractors to pre-qualify have been&#13;
sent out and the evaluation is expected to be completed by end-March 1997. PMU1&#13;
intends to invite pre-qualified contractors to bid in April 1997. A preliminary list of roads&#13;
have been selected for periodic maintenance and visual survey of the Highway No. 1 from&#13;
Dong Ha to Quang Ngai has been carried out to identify sections eligible for periodic&#13;
maintenance (i. e. excluding sections requiring widening andlor raising of the&#13;
embankment for flood protection). PMU 1 is in the process of engaging local consultants&#13;
to assist in the preparation of bid documents for periodic maintenance.&#13;
3.28     As mentioned earlier, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared by MOT&#13;
with the assistance of consultants during the feasibility/engineering phase of the project&#13;
was discussed with MOT during pre-appraisal missions. Due to clearance activities carried&#13;
out by Government under Decree 36/CP effective August 1, 1995 for road safety, the&#13;
social survey which was carried out earlier in April 1995 had to be revised to include data&#13;
on already affected persons in the RAP. The RAP was revised accordingly and approved&#13;
by MOT (November 1996). Its approval by the Prime Minister is a condition of approval&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
of the Interim Fund Credit. All outstanding issues under the on-going highway project&#13;
have been resolved and resettlement is nearly completed in the entire project corridor.&#13;

will be handled by VRA, RRMUs and PDOTs after initial training and under close&#13;
oversight by PMU1. PMU1 is familiar with Bank procurement procedures through its&#13;

involvement in the on-going highway rehabilitation project. It will also provide guidance&#13;
to and oversee the procurement actions of VRA and RRMUs. Goods and civil works&#13;
financed by IDA (ITF) will be procured using procedures outlined in "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA (ITF) Credits, January 1995, revised January and&#13;
August 1996"5. The Borrower will be required to use the Bank Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for goods and works under ICB, Bank Standard Form of Contract for&#13;
Consultant Services, and the Standard Bid Evaluation Form for evaluation of bids. During&#13;
negotiations, the Borrower's local procurement procedures (Decree 43/CP dated July 16,&#13;
1996) were jointly reviewed and the required revisions and clarifications for purposes of&#13;
consistency with Bank's Guidelines applicable to NCB, were discussed and agreed upon.&#13;
Advertising through a Specific Procurement Notice in the Development Business and/or&#13;
well-known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide international&#13;
circulation will be mandatory for contracts with estimated values exceeding US$10&#13;
million.&#13;
3.31     IDA (ITF) financed civil works have been divided into ICB and NCB packages&#13;
taking into account geographic spread, size of individual contracts and the objective of&#13;
fostering growth in the domestic construction industry. The ICB works for the Vinh-Dong&#13;
Ha road section will be packaged into four lots each valued at between US$20-40 million;&#13;
and the periodic maintenance works (asphalt overlay) of selected sections between Dong&#13;
Ha and Quang Ngai will also be packaged for ICB into four lots valued at between US$4-&#13;
10 million. Bidders for works procured under ICB procedures would be prequalified in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.32     Civil Works. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost individually more&#13;
than US$2.0 million will be procured by ICB. Eligible domestic contractors' bids will be&#13;
evaluated on a 7.5 percent margin of preference for ICB contracts. Civil works estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$2.0 million per contract up to an aggregate value of US$42.3 million&#13;
would be procured by NCB procedures satisfactory to IDA which will include: local&#13;
advertising; public opening; clearly stated evaluation criteria; award to the lowest&#13;
evaluated responsive bidder; and non-exclusion of foreign bidders if they wish to&#13;
participate. NCB contracts would consist of around 25-35 resurfacing, resealing,&#13;
regravelling and other repair contracts of average value US$1.2 million each scattered all&#13;
over the country. Government has granted autonomy to a large number of state-owned&#13;
civil engineering construction companies which, along with private contractors, are&#13;
expected to operate independently seeking contracts nationwide. Hence there will be&#13;
adequate competition among domestic contractors and international contractors will be&#13;
permitted to bid if they so wish. The aggregate value of NCB contracts for civil works&#13;
will be about US$42.3 million of which IDA (ITF) will finance up to US$38.1 million.&#13;
As in the case of the on-going first highway project, the resettlement works, which are&#13;
5   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1.6 of the Guidelines, the proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit may&#13;
only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods and works provided by nationals of, and produced in or&#13;
supplied from, Participating Countries.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
small and scattered along the entire road alignment, would be carried out by the provinces&#13;
through force account subject to IDA's prior agreement.&#13;
3.33      Goods. Contracts for goods estimated to cost individually more than&#13;
US$200,000 will be procured by ICB. In the evaluation of bids obtained following ICB&#13;
procedures, a margin of preference equal to 15% of the CIF bid price of imported goods&#13;
or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for&#13;
domestic manufacturers. International or National shopping would be used for&#13;
procurement of goods valued at less than US$200,000 per contract up to an aggregate&#13;
amount not to exceed US$350,000. Where feasible, vehicles and office equipment for&#13;
PMU 1 would be procured through Inter-agency Procurement Services Organization&#13;
(IAPSO). Spare parts and accessories which are of proprietary nature up to an aggregate&#13;
value of $50,000, may be purchased with prior approval of IDA under directly negotiated&#13;
contracts from original manufacturers/suppliers or their authorized agents. For&#13;
international shopping, at least three price quotations from not less than two countries&#13;
would be sought.&#13;
3.34      Consultant Services. Consultant services and technical assistance under the&#13;
project (ref. para. 3.15) will be procured in accordance with principles and procedures&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, based on the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 198 1)6. The Bank's&#13;
Standard Form of Contract for Consultant's Services for Complex Time-Based&#13;
Assignments (June 1995) will be used for major consultant services.&#13;
3.35      All IDA (ITF) financed civil works ($2.0 million or more per contract) and&#13;
goods contracts ($200,000 or more per contract) procured under ICB procedures and the&#13;
first three civil works contracts under NCB procedures will be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review. This will cover more than 80% of the procurement for works and goods,&#13;
separately. The prior review threshold for consultant services will be US$100,000 in the&#13;
case of consulting firms and US$50,000 in the case of individual consultants. However, all&#13;
TORs, sole-source contracts, or contracts of a special nature for consultant services would&#13;
be subject to prior review. Selective post review of awarded contracts below the threshold&#13;
levels will be carried out during supervision missions on about I in 8 works contracts and&#13;
1 in 4 goods contracts. Annex 3.10 gives a summary of the expected procurement&#13;
packages. During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government on the&#13;
procurement arrangements, and that prior to the issue of any invitations to pre-qualify for&#13;
bidding or to bid for contracts, the proposed procurement plan for the Project shall be&#13;
furnished to IDA for its review and approval.&#13;
3.36      Procurement information will be provided by PMU1 to IDA in quarterly&#13;
reports indicating: (a) contract awards; (b) revised contract prices if and when changes&#13;

J. Disbursement&#13;
3.37      The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2002. It will be&#13;
disbursed against the categories summarized in Table 3.3 below.&#13;

3.38      The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 3.11) is based on the detailed&#13;
project implementation schedule (para. 3.26). It reflects the advance actions taken to&#13;
expedite contracting of civil works in anticipation of the IDA (ITF) credit. As there is no&#13;
IDA/Bank disbursement profile available for highway projects in Vietnam, the profile&#13;
presented reflects IDA/Bank's experience with disbursement under transport projects in&#13;
the East Asia and Pacific Region and the limited experience under the on-going first&#13;
Highway Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
3.39      Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE)&#13;
prepared by PMUl for all expenditures for (a) goods under contracts costing less than&#13;
$200,000 equivalent; (b) for works under contracts costing less than $2.0 million; (c)&#13;
training under contracts costing less than $50,000 equivalent; (d) services provided by&#13;
consulting firms under contracts costing less than $100,000 equivalent; and (e) services&#13;
provided by individual consultants under contracts costing less than $50,000.&#13;
Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by PMU1 and made available for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions. Full documentation would be required for all other&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
3.40      To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a Special Account will be established in a bank acceptable to IDA, and on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The account will be established in US currency&#13;
with an authorized allocation of US$10.0 million initially limited to $5.0 million until the&#13;
aggregate amount of withdrawals plus outstanding special commitments amount to&#13;
US$22.0 million. The account would be replenished monthly or when it is drawn down by&#13;
30% of the initial deposit, whichever comes first. Minimum application size for payments&#13;
directly from the Credit Account or for issuance of Special Commitments is US$2.0&#13;
million.&#13;
K. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.41     During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government that: (a) the&#13;
implementing agencies would keep separate project accounts for their respective project&#13;
components, while consolidated project accounts would be maintained by PMU 1; (b) the&#13;
Special Account and the project accounts, including documentation for SOEs, would be&#13;
audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA, with the audit&#13;
including a separate opinion on the SOEs used as a basis for disbursements; and (c) the&#13;
detailed audit reports would be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of each&#13;
government fiscal year.&#13;
L. Project Supervision, Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
3.42     During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government that annual&#13;
implementation reviews (by June 30 of each year commencing in 1997) and a mid-term&#13;
review (by June 30, 2000) will be undertaken jointly with IDA. Soon after the Credit is&#13;
declared effective, PMU 1 will organize and hold a project launch workshop in Hanoi.&#13;
All implementing agencies will be involved and representatives of project beneficiaries&#13;
will be invited to attend. IDA will be represented by engineering, economic, financial,&#13;
disbursement, procurement and resettlement specialists. During the course of&#13;
implementation, the project will be supervised by Bank staff in accordance with the&#13;
supervision plan given in Annex 3.12. Annual implementation reviews with Government&#13;
will be carried out jointly with other donors active in the sector each November to&#13;
evaluate progress with the project, review Government's expenditure plan for the road&#13;
sector including funding for routine and periodic maintenance.&#13;
3.43     Agreement was also obtained during negotiations, that PMU1 will prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA, consolidated quarterly reports on the physical and financial progress of&#13;
the project, including procurement information (para 3.36), in a format acceptable to IDA.&#13;
The reports would be submitted within one month of the end of each quarter ending on&#13;
March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, the first of such reports to be&#13;
furnished by October 31, 1997. The set of quantifiable performance indicators (Annex&#13;
3.13) related to project objectives and monitorable targets was agreed with Government&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.1      The project continues the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Highway 1,&#13;
started under IDA's First Highway Project and upon completion it, together with&#13;
corresponding projects financed by Japan and ADB will provide the only efficient&#13;
transport link between the economic growth areas of the north, center and the south.&#13;
Moreover, the rehabilitation of Highway I will significantly reduce the Central Coastal&#13;
Provinces' relative geographical isolation, improve their access to national and&#13;
international markets and thus eliminate a major obstacle to the economic and social&#13;
development of one of the poorest regions in Vietnam. In addition, the Pilot Periodic&#13;
Maintenance program will introduce modern road maintenance methods and reduce&#13;
vehicle operating costs on the 950 km of high priority roads selected throughout the&#13;
country.&#13;
B. Methodology&#13;
4.2.     The proposed Project has been evaluated on a with and without project basis.&#13;
Without the project the Vinh - Dong Ha section of Highway 1 would continue to&#13;
deteriorate and vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs would increase rapidly.&#13;
Moreover, road accidents would likely be higher and flooding of parts of the road would&#13;
occur more frequently than with the project.&#13;
4.3      Various road rehabilitation options were tested by means of the Bank's Highway&#13;
Design and Maintenance Model (HDM III) and one was found optimal in terms of&#13;
economic return, improved road safety and flood protection (Annex 4.1). The option&#13;
chosen consists of the rehabilitation of the Vinh - Dong Ha section to the specified road&#13;
standards and includes the reconstruction of two bridges, additional culverts and&#13;
embankments and bridge raising to eliminate flooding on all sections of the highway, based&#13;
on a maximum overtopping of 30 cm. This solution means that flooding will be reduced&#13;
only to extraordinary events occurring on average once in 10 years.&#13;
4.4      Construction is assumed to begin at Vinh and Dong Ha simultaneously,&#13;
progressing from both ends towards the center, which is feasible from the point of view of&#13;
logistics and which tends to maximize the economic return since the most viable sections&#13;
would be completed first. It has also been assumed that roughly one third of the highway&#13;
is completed by the end of 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively. Thus benefits begin to&#13;
build up in the period 1998 - 2000 and continue until the end of 2010, the assumed life of&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
C. Costs and Benefits&#13;
4.5       Costs and benefits were calculated in terms of 1995 prices on a resource cost&#13;
basis, i.e. all transfer payments such as taxes and interest are excluded. The costs of the&#13;
project consist of the costs of road construction and rehabilitation (including design and&#13;
supervision) of the Vinh -Dong Ha section of Highway 1; the construction of two major&#13;
bridges and other works; the costs of resettlement and relocation and the recurrent costs&#13;
of routine and periodic maintenance. The benefits included in the economic analysis&#13;
consist of reduced motor vehicle operating costs (the most important benefit); reduced&#13;
motorcycle operating costs; savings in existing vehicle travel time costs; reduced road&#13;
maintenance costs and benefits related to improved flood protection. Due to an&#13;
inadequate data base benefits from increased road safety and the increased road and&#13;
bridge capacity were iAot quantified. No account was taken either of the potential for&#13;
generated traffic. Furthermore, the benefits of replacing the ferry services at Quan Hau&#13;
with a bridge were not taken into account because of unavailability of reliable data. The&#13;
costs of the bridge were therefore treated as part of the costs of road improvement.&#13;
4.6      The project component "periodic maintenance of priority road sections",&#13;
comprising about 33 % of total project costs, has been selected on the basis of the&#13;
technical and economic feasibility of each selected section, taking into account as well&#13;
their pilot character as demonstration projects for the introduction of new road&#13;
maintenance management techniques, and hence its geographic location. The total costs&#13;
of this component include periodic maintenance on the selected roads, supervision,&#13;
maintenance equipment for VRA and the RRMUs and physical contingencies. Reduced&#13;
vehicle operating costs for four-wheel vehicles, based on the HDM calculations, are the&#13;
main econornic benefits of the maintenance program. Reduced operating costs of&#13;
motorbikes (which are estimated to constitute about 20% of total benefits on the Vinh-&#13;
Dong Ha segment of Highway 1) have not been included in the analysis because traffic&#13;
counts for these vehicles were not available for the roads included in the maintenance&#13;
program.&#13;
4.7      Other project costs and benefits, such as support to PMU 1, VRA and other&#13;
agencies, training and studies (4.7 % of total project costs), cannot directly be attributed&#13;
to the rehabilitation of the Vinh - Dong Ha section of Highway 1 since the entire transport&#13;
sector will benefit in the form of more efficient institutions and decision making and&#13;
skilled human resources.&#13;
D. Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.8      The economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and the net present value (NPV)&#13;
at the opportunity cost of capital (10%) have been calculated for the entire Vinh - Dong&#13;
Ha highway segment and for each road link within the entire segment. The results are&#13;
shown in the Table 4.1 below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;

4.9      Both the EIRRs and the NPVs are satisfactory for the project as a whole and&#13;
by link. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the entire Vinh - Dong Ha segment and&#13;
by link. These included construction cost increases, benefit decreases and a combination&#13;
of both. In addition, a break-even analysis was conducted to determine the cost increases&#13;
(benefit decreases) at which the project NPV would become negative at the discount rate&#13;
of 10%. The main results are shown in Table 4.2 below; details are in Annex 4.1&#13;
Table 4.2: Summary of Sensitivity Analysis&#13;

EIRR(%)    35.7    33.6    31.1    36.1    32.3    15.5    10.6&#13;
NPV(US$m)   248.3   237.1   226.0   222.6   185.7    38.5        5.18&#13;
4.10     The analysis shows that potential fluctuations in costs and benefits would not&#13;
change the economic viability of the project. A link by link analysis leads to the same&#13;
result. The break-even analysis shows that only a (very unlikely) combination of more&#13;
than a 30% capital cost increase and a 60% decrease in benefits would cause the EIRR to&#13;
fall below the opportunity cost of capital and would cause the NPV to become negative.&#13;
Thus it can be stated that the results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of&#13;
the economic return of the project. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that a number of&#13;
benefits could not be quantified with sufficient accuracy but are nevertheless considered&#13;
important, including system benefits from the construction of the new bridges at Chan Hoa&#13;
and Quan Hau; pedestrian footpaths in rural areas; special pedestrian/bicycle facilities in&#13;
villages and the potential for significant improvements in road safety.&#13;
4.11     Pilot Periodic Maintenance Program. The EIRR and NPV of the maintenance&#13;
component have been calculated as a weighted average of the entire program and&#13;
separately for the periodic maintenance on the Dong Ha - Quang Ngai section of Highway&#13;
1 and the remaining highway sections, comprising a total of 10 highways distributed&#13;
throughout the country (Annex 3.1). The results show high economic returns for the&#13;
entire program as well as its components. The entire program yields an NPV of US$96&#13;
million and an EIRR of 70%; and the subprograms range from an NPV of US$72&#13;
million and an EIRR of 91% for Highway 1 to an NPV of US$24 million and an EIRR of&#13;
43% for the remaining package of 10 roads. The difference in economic benefits between&#13;
the two packages stems from the fact that traffic levels on Highway I are on average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
almost three times as high as on the other roads. In the (unlikely) event that traffic on the&#13;
roads included in the maintenance program would stagnate at 1998 levels the economic&#13;
return would still be satisfactory (Annex 4.1).&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
4.12     The main project risks are: (a) inadequate experience in using IDA procedures&#13;
such as those for procurement, disbursements and audits, which could delay project&#13;
implementation; (b) lack of adequate counterpart funds; and (c) inexperience with and&#13;
changes in resettlement policies and practice. As a first step to minimize these risks, IDA&#13;
will soon conduct workshops and special training in IDA procedures in Vietnam. Also,&#13;
MOT has created and staffed PMU I to be responsible for implementing the project&#13;
including accounting and reporting and monitoring of progress. Technical assistance has&#13;
been provided to PMU1 to strengthen its main functions. Uncertainty about future&#13;
availability of counterpart funds is somewhat reduced by focusing on the highest priority&#13;
transport investment program and by the detailed annual reviews of the sector expenditure&#13;
program to be undertaken jointly by IDA, Government and other donors active in the&#13;
sector. With regard to resettlement, recent experience has shown that the rapidly changing&#13;
legislative and regulatory environment in Vietnam can be the source of potential conflicts&#13;
with agreed project specific resettlement policies. IDA is assisting the Government (under a&#13;
separate IDF funded project) to develop and put into practice a comprehensive national&#13;
resettlement policy which would clear up the nationwide rules and regulations. Meanwhile,&#13;
experience in dealing with resettlement issues and an extensive dialogue with Government&#13;
arising under the on-going project, have led to preparation of a mutually acceptable and&#13;
satisfactory resettlement action plan which is likely to have less implementation problems.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1      During negotiations, agreement was obtained from Government on the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) roads for periodic maintenance will be selected in accordance with&#13;
economic and other criteria satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.8);&#13;
(b) by June 30, 1998 it would furnish to IDA for its concurrence, a list of&#13;
critical road sections to be improved through safety measures (para. 3.10);&#13;
(c) no later than November 30 of each year, commencing in 1997, it will&#13;

(d) by June 30, 1998, prepare and furnish to IDA for its review and&#13;

sector for the forthcoming Borrower's fiscal year (para. 3.17);&#13;
(g) by December 31, 1997, an environmental unit comprising two officials will&#13;
be established in PMU1 and adequate steps will be taken during the design&#13;
and construction phase, to mitigate any adverse environmental impact of&#13;
the project in accordance with the EIA (para. 3.20);&#13;

to IDA within nine months of the end of each government fiscal year (para.&#13;
3.41);&#13;
(1) Government will hold annual implementation reviews by June 30 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1997 and a mid-term review by June 30, 2000 (para.&#13;
3.42);&#13;
(m)furnish to IDA consolidated quarterly reports on the physical and financial&#13;

credit of SDR 136.3 million (US$195.6 million equivalent) to the Socialist Republic of&#13;
Vietnam. The credit would be for a term of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
Second Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Periodic Maintenance of National Roads&#13;
1.    Road maintenance in Vietnam consists largely of three activities - routine&#13;
maintenance (such as vegetation clearing, shoulder and roadside repairs, drainage cleaning,&#13;
and maintenance of road signs); medium repairs (such as pothole patching, crack resealing,&#13;
spot regravelling, etc.); and big repairs (such as resealing, overlays, regravelling and minor&#13;
rehabilitation).&#13;
2.    Periodic maintenance encompasses the maintenance activities carried out as big&#13;
repairs. However, due to budget constraints, this level of maintenance has not been&#13;
accorded the priority it should have over construction or major rehabilitation. The Scot&#13;
Wilson Study of Investment and Maintenance Strategy for National and Provincial Roads&#13;
(July 1996), has estimated periodic maintenance funding needs amounting to US$31.9&#13;
million per annum on National and US$5.7 million per annum on Provincial roads during&#13;
1997-2001. Currently government is allocating little or no funds for programmed periodic&#13;
maintenance of roads.&#13;
3.    The objective of this component is to initiate a pilot program for regular planning,&#13;
programming, budgeting and execution of periodic maintenance of National roads to be&#13;
undertaken by contracts awarded through national competitive bidding. This component is&#13;
a logical follow up to the maintenance management strengthening TA financed under the&#13;
on-going highway rehabilitation project. The component would be supervised by&#13;
internationally recruited consultants who would also have the responsibility to train staff of&#13;
VRA and the RRMUs in contract administration and management, including preparation of&#13;
bid documents. The consultants would also oversee and train domestic contractors in bid&#13;
preparation, works planning, contract management and quality control.&#13;
4.    A preliminary list of roads to be considered has been selected on the basis of road&#13;
condition, traffic level, geographic distribution and estimated cost (Table 1). The list&#13;
includes sections of Highway No. 1, mostly between Dong Ha and Quan Ngai that are in a&#13;
reasonably good to fair condition, justifying only minor repairs of the carriageway plus an&#13;
asphalt concrete overlay (or surface dressing) without widening or re-alignment. Hence&#13;
there will be no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement of people resulting from such&#13;
periodic maintenance activities.&#13;
5.    Due to the geographic distribution of individual sections of roads required to be&#13;
maintained and the need to use and develop the local construction industry, the contracts&#13;
would be packaged in lots suitable for national competitive bidding (NCB). Only in the&#13;
case of contiguous road sections on Highway No. 1, the works would be packaged together&#13;
in four lots to make it attractive for ICB and domestic contractors.&#13;

Second Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Support to PMUl&#13;
1.          The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has established the Highway No. I Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMUI) to coordinate the preparation, start-up and implementation of projects&#13;
related to Highway No. I which have been financed or will be considered for financing by the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other&#13;
multi-lateral and bilateral development agencies. Its main functions involve the following:&#13;
(a)         Project preparation and start-up: Prepare details of proposed projects including&#13;
design, scope, cost estimates and implementation plans; organize stakeholder workshops to obtain&#13;
inputs and build consensus on project objectives, scope and implementation arrangements; liaise&#13;
with donor agencies and obtain Government comments and approval on technical, financial,&#13;
organizational and other related aspects of proposed projects; manage the process of preparing&#13;
and modifying relevant procurement and other documents so that they are acceptable to&#13;
Government and donor agency; manage tendering and award of contracts; prepare budget and&#13;
obtain and requisite funds from Government; and maintain coordination with donor agencies.&#13;
(b)         Project Implementation: Liaise with relevant Government and donor agencies to&#13;
prequalify contractors; evaluate bids and select contractors; select supervision consultants and&#13;
other TA; perform the functions of the Employer during construction phase; manage resettlement&#13;
and environmental impact mitigation activities; manage organizational and financial aspects of&#13;
project's training components; manage the flow of government and donor funds and maintain all&#13;
accounts for the project; manage financial audits and submit reports as needed; and monitor and&#13;
evaluate physical and financial progress of all projects.&#13;
2.          Since its establishment in 1993, PMU1 has grown in size from a staff of 10 to 80 at&#13;
present. The number and volume of projects have systematically increased over the last three&#13;
years such that currently it is managing 7 on-going and pipeline projects amounting to over $800&#13;
million equivalent and the staff size is expected to increase to 90 by mid- 1997. In view of its&#13;
expanded role, the objective of providing support to PMUI under the project is to enhance its&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness in managing project preparation, administration and implementation&#13;
functions. this component would comprise the following;&#13;
(a)         Operation Center. Presently, PMUI is sharing with other institutions an office&#13;
located in the center of Hanoi with access from a narrow and crowded street. The building is old,&#13;
with irregular water and power supply and very poor auxiliary facilities. Office and parking spaces&#13;
are limited and resulting in severe difficulties for staff. To alleviate this problem, the project will&#13;
support construction of a new office building at an alternate site allocated by government. The&#13;
estimated floor area required by PMU1 is 1,200 m2, at a cost of about US$500,000 equivalent.&#13;
Annex 4.4 in the PIP gives details of the office layout and cost breakdown.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3.2&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(b)         Operating Cost. The average annual operating cost of PMU 1 is about&#13;
US$120,000 at present. This is expected to increase to about US$150,000 per annum during&#13;
1997-2000. Hence the project includes PMUl 's operating cost amounting to US$600,000 during&#13;
the first four years of the project. This will comprise costs related to supervision, vehicle&#13;
operation, office supplies, and other project related travel expenses, including salaries of&#13;
government officials, to be financed fully from domestic budget.&#13;
(c)         Vehicles and Office Eguipment. To support the increased supervision,&#13;
resettlement and field investigating activities of PMU I and to furnish the new operating center&#13;
with computers, facsimile machines and other equipment, the project will provide US$300,000&#13;
for purchase of vehicles and office equipment.&#13;
(d)         Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Services. The on-going&#13;
technical advisory services to PMU 1 (in technical engineering, resettlement, training, and financial&#13;
management) have proved extremely beneficial and a great deal of skills have been successfully&#13;
transferred to Vietnamese staff. However, with increasing and diverse responsibilities, PMUI's&#13;
needs, specially beyond 1997, are going to expand in other areas such as contract management,&#13;
oversight of periodic maintenance and other TAs related to road safety, maintenance and&#13;
pavement management systems, technical specifications, etc. To allow for this, the project&#13;
includes provision of about 20 man-months of technical advisory and consultant services.The&#13;
estimated total cost for this sub-component is US$550,000. Further more, to assist PMU1 in&#13;
building capacity (for eventual transfer to MOT) for environmental impact assessment and&#13;
monitoring (EIAM), the project will provide office and logistical support to the EIAM unit, which&#13;
will include purchase of two computers and a field vehicle, in addition to the training of two staff&#13;
in environmental management. The estimated cost for the computers, office support and the field&#13;
vehicle is US$50,000.&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
Second Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Summary of EIA and Mitigation Measures&#13;
1.    The main components of the project that might have an environmental impact are the&#13;
rehabilitation of 293 km of existing road, the construction of new bridges and the location of&#13;
quarries, borrow pits, asphalt plant, worker camps and dumps.&#13;
2.    The road will follow the existing alignment (except for the 2 major bridges at Chanh Hoa,&#13;
Km 650.40 and Quan Hau, Km 671.05). This will reduce land acquisition, encroachment on&#13;
residential, commercial and agricultural activities and will minimize environmental impacts.&#13;
3.  The rehabilitation of Highway No. 1 could have a negative impact on traffic safety. Presently,&#13;
this road is very dangerous because of its mixture of slow and fast-moving traffic and because very&#13;
few regulations are actually enforced. Increased vehicle speed on the road could lead to an increase&#13;
in the number of accidents. Moreover, urban growth along the road will add to this situation. For&#13;
these reasons the Government of Vietnam should improve policies, regulations, training, and&#13;
education. Also, to reduce the risk of accidents and traffic disturbance, the proposed design of the&#13;
road suggests the creation of paved shoulders along the road for slower traffic; these shoulders will&#13;
contribute to the separation of slow from fast moving traffic and to the improvement of safety for&#13;
every road user. Sidewalks will be built in urban and densely populated areas to ensure pedestrian&#13;
safety.&#13;
4.  Widening the roadway and shoulders, and improving their surfaces, will reduce air and noise&#13;
pollution and thereby improve the quality of life of people living along the road. The presence of a&#13;
clear area on either side of the road (3-7 m) will also contribute to this improvement. According to&#13;
the option chosen the road will be usable throughout the whole year. The population and the eco-&#13;
nomy of the study area will benefit from this situation.&#13;
5.  Constructionwork will significantly affect the environment and disturb activities along the&#13;
road with noise and dust during construction, but it is a short-term impact and would be partially&#13;
offset by mitigating measures taken during this phase.&#13;
6.  The location of borrow pits, asphalt plants, worker camps and dumps will be an important&#13;
environmental issue which may create more important negative impacts than the rehabilitation of&#13;
this section of Highway No. 1. Location of such sites must, in particular, avoid sensitive areas&#13;
(coastal areas, flooded areas, natural sensitive areas, inhabited areas). Special attention will be paid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                              Annex 3.6&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
to the effects on the water table. Existing roads must be used to reach these sites to the maximum&#13;
extent possible.&#13;
7.  The road between Vinh and Dong Ha crosses mostly rural areas which are dominated by rice&#13;
production and therefore need an important irrigation system. The road will affect 162 of these&#13;
channels. Due to the importance of irrigation networks for farmers, the interruption of water flow&#13;
must be avoided. If water stream interruption proves unavoidable, consultation with farmers and&#13;
local authorities must be carried out to find a solution satisfactory to both parties.&#13;
8.  Historic sites such as temples, memorials and bunkers located in the project corridor will be&#13;
removed or protected. Impact on these sites will be minor. Parking and rest areas will be designed&#13;
near sites with good tourist potential (Ngang Pass, Ben Hai River). This will create positive impact&#13;
for traffic and tourism.&#13;
9.  The road crosses 125 km of flooded areas. Due to the hazards linked to flooding, and&#13;
especially to unexpected flash floods, specific measures to ensure the safety to workers (e.g.&#13;
emergency plans) and to avoid contaminant spillage (e.g. material and equipment which may result&#13;
in contaminant spillage must be kept out form these zones during the rainy season; emergency plan&#13;
in case of contaminant spillage must be prepared) are proposed. Impacts will be minor. The&#13;
installation of guard-rails along flooded areas to identify road alignment will improve user safety&#13;
during flooding.&#13;
10. Fifty-one bridges need to be replaced or rehabilitated, generally on the existing alignment&#13;
except for two major bridges at Chanh Hoa (Km 650.40) and Quan Hau (Km 671.05). To minimize&#13;
environmental impacts, specific measures need to be implemented such as: (i) minimize work in&#13;
the river; (ii) use temporary bridge if needed (to ford river will be forbidden); (iii) protect&#13;
susceptible surfaces; (iv) movement of equipment in the river must be avoided or minimized; (v)&#13;
control river bank erosion with structures (gabion, rip-rap); (vi) return the beds of the river and its&#13;
banks to their natural state after construction. With the implementation of these measures, impacts&#13;
will be minor.&#13;
11. The road crosses about 40 km of sand dune areas between Km 675 and 715. Plantations along&#13;
the road and on active dune fields are present to fix soil and to prevent erosion. Replacement of&#13;
vegetation destroyed must be carried out to stop the wind erosion process.&#13;

12. A monitoring program has been developed. The purpose of the monitoring program is: (i) to&#13;
supervise the implementation of the mitigation measures; (ii) to identify environmental problems&#13;
and issues; iii) to recommend solutions. Main indicators to be monitored have been identified. The&#13;
creation of an environmental unit, in PMU. 1, in charge of monitoring, is proposed. Initially, this&#13;
unit would be staffed with at least two people. They would be trained in preparing environmental&#13;
impact studies. The training prograrn would follow the guidelines of the Ministry of Science and&#13;
Technology (MOSTE) and develop specific methodologies for carrying out EIA studies. The&#13;
staff would also be trained in monitoring the implementation of the mitigation measures. The&#13;
training program would take advantage of a CIDA sponsored Environmental program currently&#13;
being implemented for the staff of MOT. Table 1 gives a summary of the cost estimate for&#13;
establishing such a unit.&#13;

Second Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Summary of Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has identified a project to rehabilitate Highway&#13;
No. 1 between Vinh and Dong Ha. This Project (HRP-2) promotes the objectives of the&#13;
Government of Vietnam (GOV) to improve national road infrastructure and, in particular,&#13;
the main transportation route, Highway No. 1.&#13;
2.     The Vinh - Dong Ha section of Highway No. I is located in the coastal plain of&#13;
central Vietnam. The road crosses mostly rural areas dominated by rice production.&#13;
3.     The Project consists of the rehabilitation of 292 km of road to a class Im road&#13;
according to Vietnamese standard (TCVN 40-54-85) in order to allow for safe and efficient&#13;
road transportation of people and goods. The Project will require the acquisition of land for&#13;
the widening of the road and for the development of resettlement sites. Rehabilitation of&#13;
Highway No. 1 will displace or adversely affect the standard of living of people living in the&#13;
project corridor.&#13;
4.    A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with the&#13;
relevant GOV laws and guidelines and the World Bank Operational Directive 4.30 on&#13;
involuntary resettlement and it gives in greater detail the levels of adverse impact,&#13;
compensation and rehabilitation policy, and monitoring arrangements (see project files).&#13;
The main objective of the RAP is to improve, or at least restore, the standard of living and&#13;
the income of all categories of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) after the implementation of&#13;
the RAP.&#13;
Scope&#13;
5.     The RAP is based on a socioeconomic survey initially conducted in April 1995,&#13;
and updated in November 1995 following the enforcement of GOV Decree CP/36 on traffic&#13;
safety; and on a detailed measurement survey (DMS) conducted from June to August 1996&#13;
to identify the exact losses of PAPs. The RAP for HRP-2 utilized the experiences from the&#13;
first Highway rehabilitation project (HRP- 1) on the road section Hanoi-Vinh and Ho Chi&#13;
Minh City-Can Tho and from a project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB-1)&#13;
between Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City.&#13;
6.     A total of 8,487 households (37,764 persons) will be affected by the project. Of&#13;
these, 2,327 households (11,056 persons) will suffer impacts due to reorganization or&#13;
relocation of structures, 1,571 households (6,713 persons) will be affected by acquisition of&#13;
residential land and 4,589 households (19,995 persons) will be affected by agricultural and&#13;
forestry land acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
7.     Based on the socioeconomic surveys and on the DMS, the categories of impacts&#13;
identified, policies for compensation, relocation and/or rehabilitation have been established,&#13;
even for people affected only through land acquisition. Compensation will be paid at&#13;
replacement cost for affected assets without depreciation. Persons affected by house&#13;
acquisition will be: a) reorganized on the same site, but behind the right-of-way (ROW) if&#13;
they have sufficient remaining area or b) relocated (self relocation, relocation to individual&#13;
or group resettlement site). In both cases, permanent land use rights certificate would be&#13;
issued to the PAPs. Persons affected by land acquisition will be compensated for land in&#13;
cash at replacement cost if they are only marginally affected, or with land-for-land&#13;
compensation or cash at PAPs option if they are severely affected. An action plan for&#13;
rehabilitating and compensating the PAPs affected by clearance under Decree 36/CP is&#13;
included in the RAP.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
8.     The RAP will be implemented through a strategy of creation of assets and&#13;
community development in suitable locations. It will be implemented by the Peoples'&#13;
Committees at the provincial, district and commune levels under the general direction of&#13;
the Highway No. 1 Project Management Unit (PMU 1).&#13;
9.    Activities required to implement the RAP satisfactorily are:&#13;
-     Determining Detailed Compensation Rates&#13;
Provinces will establish unit rates for compensation based on replacement cost&#13;
and affected area rather than useable area of structures. PMU 1 and the monitoring&#13;
organization will review the rates and advise revisions where necessary. An inter-&#13;
ministerial commission will be set up at the national level, if necessary to resolve&#13;
outstanding differences in provisional unit rates which cannot be resolved at the&#13;
provincial level.&#13;
Resettlement Sites&#13;
After the selection of resettlement sites, preparation of layouts and site&#13;
development plans will be undertaken. Contracts for site development will then be&#13;
awarded.&#13;
House construction&#13;
Once the resettlement sites have been prepared (land fill, grading, grading of roads&#13;
and plots) house construction can begin.&#13;
Demolition of Existing Structures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
District authorities can only start the demolition of the existing structures after&#13;
facilities at resettlement sites are fully developed and compensation/rehabilitation&#13;
has been fully paid.&#13;
10.   To ensure that all affected persons are properly reorganized/relocated before the&#13;
start of project construction, it will be ensured that all land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
activities are completed at least 1 month before the proposed date of actual&#13;
commencement of physical works. The following activities have to be completed before&#13;
the start of construction activities on any particular road section:&#13;
a)     Payment of all compensation and rehabilitation for land, houses and other&#13;
structures;&#13;
b)     Relocation or reorganization of all affected persons;&#13;
c)     Completion of basic civic infrastructure at the relocation sites&#13;
Monitoring Indicators&#13;
11.   The following indicators will be monitored and evaluated:&#13;
a)     Payment of compensation: (i) payment to be made to all affected persons&#13;
sufficiently before land acquisition; (ii) adequacy of payment to replace the affected&#13;
assets; (iii) the compensation for affected structures should be equivalent to the&#13;
replacement cost of materials and labor based on standards and special features of&#13;
construction and no deduction should be made for depreciation or value of salvageable&#13;
materials; (iv) compensation for public facilities and restoration of public facilities if&#13;
required.&#13;
b)     Restoration of civic infrastructure: (i) all necessary infrastructure (water supply,&#13;
drainage system, electricity, roads) should be restored at the resettlement sites or at the&#13;
site of relocation at least up to a standard equal to the standard at the original location; (ii)&#13;
the compensation for all infrastructure should be sufficient to reconstruct it to the same&#13;
quality.&#13;
c)     Provision of resettlement site: (i) affected people who are entitled to be relocated&#13;
to a resettlement site and who opt for relocation to a resettlement site, should be&#13;
consulted about the location of the site, site design and plot allocation on the site; (ii) site&#13;
location, site design, infrastructure, and plot allocation should enable affected people to&#13;
restore living standards; (iii) the affected persons should receive on time their entitlement&#13;
for moving allowance and subsistence allowance; (iv) affected people who are to relocate&#13;
to a resettlement site should be allocated a site to begin constructing their houses at least&#13;
three months before the commencement of civil works.&#13;
d)     Structure construction: (i) the timing of house construction should be monitored to&#13;
determine length of construction period; (ii) the quality of house construction should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
monitored to determine whether a temporary or permanent structure is built; (iii) delivery,&#13;
distribution and use of construction materials should be monitored.&#13;
e)     Provision of training and availability of credit assistance: (i) training should be&#13;
provided for one member of each eligible affected family who will be relocated, if the&#13;
family chooses to opt for training; (ii) the kind of training will depend on the preference&#13;
of the affected person and the availability of a training course; (iii) the option of post-&#13;

Project Supervision Plan&#13;
1.    The World Bank will supervise the procurement process and construction&#13;
progress throughout the duration of the project. The project supervision will cover the&#13;
period of September 1996 to December 2001. During this period, the Bank will&#13;
undertake three supervision missions a year in 1997 and 1998 and two missions a year&#13;
after 1999. In addition to the regular supervision needs, support will be given from the&#13;
headquarters on procurement actions, technical assistance by consultants, training&#13;
arrangement, etc. The Resident Mission in Viet Nam will continuously provide support&#13;
to the PMU1 on disbursement procedures and procurement actions through NCB.&#13;
2.    In addition, there will be an annual road sector donor consultative meeting to&#13;
ensure that the donor agencies and MOT (i) properly coordinate all project related&#13;
activities (ii) exchange views on all project issues of common concern and interests (iii)&#13;
consult on the forthcoming investment programs and budget proposals and (iv) resolve&#13;
outstanding problems impeding project implementation.&#13;
3.    The following is a tentative schedule for the supervision missions.&#13;

Performance Indicators and Monitorable Targets&#13;
1.    The progress towards the attainment of various project objectives will be judged by&#13;
key performance indicators. The project objectives are to:&#13;
(a) reduce transport costs through improved national road infrastructure,&#13;
particularly, Highway No. 1;&#13;
(b) enhance efficiency of the road sector institutions in periodic maintenance of the&#13;
national road network;&#13;
(c) reduce vehicle overloading and improve traffic safety;&#13;
(d) enhance institutional capacity of MOT in environmental impact assessment and&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
2.        The key performance indicators to be monitored during project implementation&#13;
and after completiion are: (i) reduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs); (ii) reduced tariffs for&#13;
transport of passengers and goods in real terms; (iii) increased travel speed; (iv) increase in&#13;
volume of periodic maintenance undertaken by competitive tendering; (v) reduction in&#13;
incidence of overloaded vehicles; (vi) reduction in accidents and number of fatalities; (vii)&#13;
production and use of guidelines for EIA of road projects.&#13;
3.    Table 1 gives a detailed description of the performnance indicators in terms of&#13;
objectively verifiable indicators (OVI); mear-s of verification; baseline values; target values&#13;
and any external factors that might influence the impact.&#13;
4.    Where currently not available, figures and target values for indicators will be&#13;
established. PMU 1 will collect this data in the early part of project implementation with the&#13;
assistance of local consultants as needed.&#13;

Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    The achievement of project output will be measured by monitoring indicators.&#13;
Project outputs can be defined by immediate project targets and initial flows of services,&#13;
such as physical quantity (length of road rehabilitated); institutionF.1 strengthening (road&#13;
maintenance, training achieved); quality (road roughness, safety initiatives); change in the&#13;
enabling environment and risk factors (regulatory reforms).&#13;
2.    The following monitoring indicators were set up for some of the key-project&#13;
components. There are time bound monitorable targets which will be described as actual&#13;
physical outputs or percentage of components implemented.&#13;
(a) length of Highway I rehabilitated (out of 290 kin);&#13;
(b) percentage of PAPs resettled;&#13;
(c) length of roads with periodic maintenance conducted (out of 550km);&#13;
(d) percentage of road safety program completed (out of identified hazardous&#13;
road sections);&#13;
(e) progress of equipment purchase for PMU 1 and RRMUs (in percentage of&#13;
dollar value);&#13;
(f) progress of training component for MOT, VNRA, RRMUs, and PMU1 (in&#13;
percentage of completed training).&#13;
3.    The current monitorable targets are as follows&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
Second Highway Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The cost-benefit analysis has been carried out by means of the HDM-III model, adapted to&#13;
the traffic and other road characteristics of Viet Nam. Some parameters, not included in HDM-lI&#13;
(e.g. motorcycle operating costs), were estimated separately and incorporated as exogenous data.&#13;
This summary of the economic evaluation outlines the methodology used in forecasting traffic,&#13;
determining economic costs and benefits, selecting the optimal rehabilitation/reconstruction&#13;
solution from a number of alternatives and testing the sensitivity of the chosen solution to changes&#13;
in key cost and benefit variables.&#13;
1.    Traffic Forecasts&#13;
The traffic forecast is based on traffic counts carried out by consultants in the context of&#13;
preparing the proposed project as well as historical data collected in 1990 and updated in 1993.&#13;
Traffic counts by type of vehicle, including motorcycles were conducted for each road link. Future&#13;
traffic was forecast by road link taking into account changes in vehicle mix and an economic&#13;
growth scenario of 8% real GDP growth. The resulting compound growth rate of about 12% p.a.&#13;
for four wheel vehicles and about 20% for motorcycles corresponds with recorded growth rates on&#13;
Highway I A and forecasts made for similar projects on other segements of Highway I A. The&#13;
traffic forecast on a link by link basis for the Vinh - Dong Ha road segment is shown in the table&#13;
below:&#13;

2.     Costs and Benefits&#13;
2.1    Costs&#13;
The costs taken into account in the evaluation are the economic costs of the various&#13;
rehabilitation options considered, i.e. taxes, interest and other transfer payments are excluded. No&#13;
attempt was made to estimate shadow prices of inputs (such as labor) since factor and product&#13;
markets in Viet Nam are reasonably undistorted and international inputs are provided on the basis&#13;
of international competitive bidding. On this basis the cost categories taken into account are&#13;
construction costs, including engineering, procurement and construction management costs;&#13;
maintenance costs, including administration (O&amp;M); resettlement/relocation costs and vehicle&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
Construction cost estimates are based on information provided by local and international&#13;
contractors and from the analysis of recent bids for similar projects in Viet Nam and other Asian&#13;
countries. For items such as asphaltic concrete, common excavation etc., average unit prices of the&#13;
five lowest bids received for such items for the first IDA highway project were used. Therefore,&#13;
the construction cost estimates are considered realistic and reflect current road construction costs&#13;
in Viet Nam. Unit road maintenance costs after construction are based on the assumption that&#13;
improved methods and standards are used. Maintenance costs for the status quo and each&#13;
improvement option were estimated by the HDM-III model. Resettlement and relocation costs are&#13;
based on actual compensation paid in two similar road projects. Vehicle operating costs were&#13;
calculated by the VOC component of the HDM-IlI model and motorcycle operating costs were&#13;
calculated on the basis of technical, operating and cost characteristics relevant for Viet Nam.&#13;
2.2    Economic Benefits&#13;
The main quantified economic benefits for the various rehabilitation options analysed are&#13;
savings in existing vehicle operating costs (VOC); savings in motorcycle r)perating costs (MOC);&#13;
savings in vehicle travel time costs; reduced road maintenance costs and be.nefits from flood&#13;
protection. In addition, a residual value of US$5 mill. at the end of the project's life was estimated&#13;
by the HDM-III model and included as a benefit. Other economic benefits such as benefits from&#13;
increased safety, increased road capacity or generated traffic due to the improved quality of the&#13;
road were not quantified because of lack of reliable information.&#13;
The various categories of benefits have been calculated as follows. Savings in VOC were&#13;
calculated by the HDM-III model as the difference between the status quo and the various&#13;
rehabilitation options considered. Savings in motorcycle operating costs could not be entered&#13;
directly into the HDM-III model. These benefits were estimated by determining existing MOC and&#13;
assuming that percentage reductions in unit MOC are the same as for passenger cars calculated by&#13;
the HDM-III model. Annual benefit were calculated by multiplying unit MOC by the estimated&#13;
number of annual motorcycle vehicle kilometers. The results thus obtained were compared with&#13;
results obtained by other methods and all methods produced savings of approximately one US-cent&#13;
per motorcycle kilometer. Savings in vehicle travel time costs are automatically calculated by the&#13;
HDM-Ill model through a comparison of the status quo with the various rehabilitation options.&#13;
The same procedure applies to savings in road maintenance costs. Benefits from flood protection&#13;
have been estimated on the basis of the economic value of passenger time or crew wages and an&#13;
opportunity cost calculated for vehicles and cargo carried as well as a reduction in the cost of&#13;
rescue activities.&#13;

3.     Economic Evaluation&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation of Vinh - Dong Ha Section&#13;
The economic evaluation of the proposed project was carried out by testing a number of&#13;
rehabilitation/reconstruction options and then selecting and sensitivity testing of the optimal&#13;
option .&#13;
3.1    Options for rehabilitation/reconstruction&#13;
The following four options were considered:&#13;
Option 1:     Pavement overlay.  This option consists of a simple pavement overlay on the&#13;
existing macadam surface and some works to fill the largest holes. Benefits would consist in&#13;
correcting the rough surface and making the highway reasonably smooth. Disadvantages: Only&#13;
short-lived, marginal improvement of the highway, no flood protection, no safety improvments, no&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
Option 2:     Pavement widening and reinforcing and bridge rehabilitation. This option consists&#13;
of the reconstruction of the road foundation to internationally acceptable standard; rehabilitation&#13;
or reconstruction of all bridges and culverts, except the large bridges at Chan Hoa and Quan Hau;&#13;
widening of the road to 7 m plus a 1.5 - 2 m shoulder on each side; safety improvements and&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Annex 4.1&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Option 3:     Partial solution of flooding problem.  This option consists of the measures&#13;
proposed in option 2 plus the construction/replacement of the bridges at Chan Hoa and Quan Hau;&#13;
raising of the highway (and small bridges) and installation of additional culverts to eliminate&#13;
flooding on all sections of the highway based on a 10-year recurrence of maximum overtopping of&#13;
30 cm.&#13;
Option 4:     Complete solution of the flooding problem. This option consists of option 3 plus&#13;
additional works to eliminate 10-year recurrent flooding.&#13;
By-pass South of Vinh City. In addition to the above options the GOV requested that the&#13;
economic and technical feasibility of the construction of a by-pass road around Vinh should be&#13;
considered. The works would consist of the construction of a road foundation and pavement cover&#13;
for the 17 km by-pass, including resettlement related to the by-pass).&#13;
Option I was discarded in the further analysis since it did not respond to the required&#13;
rehabilitation and desired improvements in road quality and safety. Options 2 - 4 showed the&#13;
following differences in capital costs.&#13;
* Option 2: US$128.lmill.&#13;
- Option 3: US$138.6 mill.&#13;
- Option 4: US$152.4 mill.&#13;
Construction of the by-pass would cost an additional US$6.3 million for any of the above options.&#13;
The table below compares the three options in terms of their EIRR's and NPVs&#13;
(discounted at 10%).&#13;

EIRR and NPV (mill. US$): Comparison of Options&#13;
Option                        2                     3                    4&#13;
EIRR                         42.1                  39.8                 36.2&#13;
NPV (US$ mill.)             265.9                 259.6                245.7&#13;
The table above indicates that all three options can be considered viable from an economic&#13;
point of view. While option 2 shows the highest economic return in terms of EIRR and NPV it&#13;
provides inadequate protection against flooding since the pavement strengthening included in this&#13;
option only reduces by one third (about 22 km) the road sections subject to flooding. By contrast,&#13;
option 3 provides a significant level of flood protection for the entire road. Road traffic would be&#13;
protected from flooding by all but the heaviest floods with a probability of occurring only every 10&#13;
years. Option 4 offers complete protection but shows the lowest economic return. The option that&#13;
best meets design requirements and a satisfactory economic return is option 3 which was chosen&#13;
for the design of the road.&#13;
The addition of a by-pass around Vinh would lower the economic return of the project only&#13;
slightly. However, the additional capacity around Vinh will most likely only be needed shortly&#13;
after the year 2000. It was therefore decided to delete the by-pass from the proposed project.&#13;

3.2    Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
Both the EIRRs and the NPVs for the retained rehabilitation/reconstruction option are&#13;
satifactory for the project as a whole and by link. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the&#13;
entire Vinh - Dong Ha segment and by link. These included construction cost increases, benefit&#13;
decreases and a combination of both. In addition, a break-even analysis was conducted to&#13;
determine the cost increases (benefit decreases) at which the EIRR would fall below 10% and the&#13;
project NPV would become negative at the discount rate of 10%. The main results are shown in&#13;
the table below.&#13;

NPV      248.3    237.1    226.0    222.6    185.7    38.5          5.18&#13;
N.b.:  Capital cost increase plus 12% is equivalent to the base cost plus physical contingencies.&#13;
The analysis shows that potential fluctuations in costs and benefits would not change the&#13;
economic viability of the project. A link by link analysis leads to the same result. The break-even&#13;
analysis shows that only a (very unlikely) combination of more than 30% capital cost increases&#13;
and a 60% decrease in benefits would cause the EIRR to fall below the opportunity cost of capital&#13;
for Viet Nam (estimated at 10%) and would cause the NPV to become negative. Thus it can be&#13;
stated that the results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the economic return of&#13;
the project. Moreover, a number of benefits could not be quantified with sufficient accuracy but&#13;
are nevertheless considered important, including system benefits from the construction of the new&#13;
bridges at Chan Hoa and Quan Hau; pedestrian footpaths in rural areas; special pedestrian/bicycle&#13;
facilities in villages and the potential for significant improvements in road safety.&#13;
The project continues the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Highway 1 A, started under&#13;
IDA's First Highway Project and upon completion it, together with corresponding projects&#13;
financed by OECF (bridges) and ADB (Highway I A from HCMC to Dong Ha), will provide the&#13;
only efficient transport link between the economic growth poles of the north, center and the south.&#13;
In addition, the rehabilitation of Highway I A will significantly reduce the Central Coastal&#13;
Provinces' relative geographical isolation, improve their access to national and international&#13;
markets and thus eliminate a major obstacle to the economic and social development of one of the&#13;
poorest regions in Viet Nam.&#13;
(b)    Pilot Periodic Maintenance Program&#13;
The Pilot Periodic Maintenance Program has been selected on the basis of economic&#13;
viability and geographical spread, so as to ensure that all units concerned with road maintenance&#13;
will be included in the program. The roads chosen are 222 km of Highway l, between Dong Ha&#13;
and Quang Ngai and 730 km out of a total 1,849 km of 10 highways distributed throughout the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

country. All highways are paved national roads. The costs included in the program are the costs&#13;
of periodic maintenance, supervision, the provision of maintenance equipment for the VRA and&#13;
RRMUs, as well as a physical contingency of about 8%. The quantifiable benefits consist of a&#13;
reduction in vehicle operating costs due to the reduction in pavement roughtness from about IRI&#13;
6.5 to IRI 2.5 on all roads included in the program. The interval between periodic maintenance has&#13;
been assumed at seven years. The without case assumes that routine maintenance is carried out but&#13;
not periodic maintenance.&#13;
The evaluation of the Pilot Periodic Maintenance Program is based on results obtained from&#13;
applying the HM-III model to Vietnam. The evaluation considers first the program as a whole on&#13;
the basis of weighted average AADT flows and then the Highway 1 segment and the remaining&#13;
segments on the ten other highways separately. The reason for choosing this procedure is that first,&#13;
traffic volumes on the relevant sections of Highway 1 are about three times higher than on the&#13;
remaining sections included in the pilot program and second, the type of maintenance deemed&#13;
appropriate for Highway I is substantially higher (US$113,000/km) than for the remainder of the&#13;
pilot (US$44,500/km).&#13;

VOC Savings, Net Benefits and NPV in million US$.&#13;
Assuming a worst case scenario of stagnant traffic for the Pilot Maintenance Program the&#13;
expenditure would still be economically justified for the entire program as well as its components.&#13;
On this basis the entire program would yield an NPV of US$46 million and an EIRR of 45%, the&#13;
Highway I component an NPV of US$38 million and an EIRR of 62%; the other 10 highways&#13;
together an NPV of US$9 million and an EIRR of 24%.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The broader developmental goal of the
            Second Highway Rehabilitation Project is to raise overall
            economic efficiency and support the country's economic
            and social development through an improved transport
            infrastructure.  The specific project objectives are: to
            reduce transport costs through improved national road
            infrastructure, particularly, Highway No. 1;  to enhance the
            efficiency by road sector institutions in periodic
            maintenance of the national road network; to reduce vehicle
            overloading and improve traffic safety; and to enhance the
            Ministry of Transport and Communications' institutional
            capacity in environmental impact assessment and monitoring.
            The project will comprise the following components:  (1)
            Road maintenance and rehabilitation -this includes
            reconstructing the Vinh-Dong Ha section of National Highway
            No. 1, reconstructing two major bridges at Chanh Hoa and
            Quan Hau; acquiring land, resettling and rehabilitating
            project-affected people, and providing supervision
            consultant services;  (2) Periodic maintenance of selected
            priority national roads -this aims at systematic, periodic
            maintenance of national highways by contract, and
            implementation of the new road maintenance management system
            being developed under the on-going first highway
            rehabilitation project;  (3)   Improvement of hazardous road
            sections -selected critical sections of national highways
            will be improved based on the Vietnam Road Safety
            Improvement Study made under the first highway
            rehabilitation project, and will include measures to improve
            traffic safety like providing adequate road furniture,
            signs, and traffic management facilities;  (4) Support to
            the Project Management Unit for Highway No. 1 (PMU1) -this
            will further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
            PMU1 to manage highway projects by purchasing vehicles and
            office equipment, construct an operating center, and give
            technical support for project implementation, monitoring and
            evaluation functions, operation cost, staff training, and
            support for environmental impact assessment;  (5) Support to
            the Vietnam Road Administration (VRA) and the Regional Road
            Management Unions (RRMU) -this will enhance institutional
            capacity by providing additional maintenance equipment for
            RRMUs and axle load weighing stations and equipment for VRA;
            (6) Training -this will train the trainers for the transport
            sector training system, strengthen local institutions, and
            enhance the skills of highway sector manpower;   (7)
            Detailed design and engineering studies -this includes the
            design and engineering study of two road sections and
            detailed design and preparation of bid documents for future
            periodic maintenance components.
