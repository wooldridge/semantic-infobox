KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
PART I. SECTOR BACKGROUND, ISSUES, AND STRATEGIES&#13;
A. Economic and Sectoral Background&#13;
1.1   The Kyrgyz Republic is a small landlocked country in Central Asia with a population of 4.5&#13;
million people. It is located in a mountainous area and has common borders with Kazakstan, China,&#13;
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The country became an independent state in 1991 as a result of the&#13;
disintegration of the Soviet Union. Since then it has been developing as a secular state and attempting to&#13;
implement market reforms. Price liberalization has, to a large extent, been completed and external trade&#13;
has become almost free of major restrictions. Similarly, the foreign exchange regime and interest rates&#13;
have been fully liberalized. Privatization and enterprise restructuring are underway, with the state&#13;
reducing direct involvement in economic activity, domestic production and distribution.&#13;
1.2   The Kyrgyz Republic is among the countries most adversely affected by the transition, which has&#13;
had a significant negative impact on the health status of the population. Poverty is a prevalent and&#13;
persistent problem. Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, about one third of the&#13;
population had a "socially unacceptable standard of living". Much of the existing poverty in the country&#13;
is, therefore, inherited and structural. According to the 1993 Kyrgyz Living Standards Survey, 40 percent&#13;
of households then lived in poverty with 25 percent classified as very poor. There were significant&#13;
disparities in the extent of poverty among the populations of different regions; farnilies headed by people&#13;
of different age groups; rural and urban populations; families of entrepreneurs and families of non-&#13;
entrepreneurs; employed and unemployed; families with income generated by employment and families&#13;
with income based on the provisions of social safety net; as well as among families with many children&#13;
and families with only a few children in the rural areas.&#13;
1.3   The level of financing of broad social programs inherited from the Soviet system was at an&#13;
unsustainable level. Following independence, in order to stabilize the economy the Kyrgyz Government&#13;
allowed social expenditures to fall from nearly 17 percent of GDP in 1990 to 9 percent in 1993, although&#13;
by 1994, the figure had increased to 14 percent. The health expenditures followed the same pattern,&#13;
dropping from 3.7 percent of GDP to 2.4, and then increased again to 3.6. Social assistance expenditures&#13;
were most affected, falling from 6.1 percent of GDP in 1991 to 3.4 percent in 1994. The enterprises,&#13;
which used to be major providers of subsidized social services, have encountered severe financial&#13;
difficulties and are now forced to divest their social assets.&#13;
1.4    World Bank studies show that while in 1994 local governments covered 84 percent of the health&#13;
expenditures and 74 percent of the expenditures on education, the current intergovernmental system has&#13;
several features that could jeopardize the social safety net including: (i) revenue sharing arrangements&#13;
which give subnational governments limited incentive to increase their tax efforts; (ii) a transfer system&#13;
which provides soft budget constraints for subnational governments and reduces incentives to cut&#13;
expenditures and/or increase the revenue collection efforts; (iii) local tax administrations which might be&#13;
more loyal to the local level with a potential non-compliance; (iv) limited correspondence of expenditures&#13;
and revenues, which forces local governments to accumulate large payment arrears; and (v) full&#13;
expenditure autonomy at the local level, which leads to ad hoc expenditure cuts or large arrears for social&#13;
expenditures, especially in the poorer regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.5    Although redefining the role of the state has been successful in the Kyrgyz Republic with respect&#13;
to its withdrawal from micro-management and liberalizing the economy, the Government now has an&#13;
even greater challenge to create new institutions which will effectively provide for instances where market&#13;
forces alone cannot cope. The social sectors, and the health system, in particular, require a careful&#13;
institutional restructuring while the provision of services cannot be interrupted. The sensitivity and&#13;
complexity of issues involved in health reform in the Kyrgyz Republic under conditions of severe&#13;
economic crisis present a strong case for the Bank's participation.&#13;
1.6    The Kyrgyz health care financing and delivery system is a vestige of the centrally planned&#13;
national health service system of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Such systems performed well in termis&#13;
of guaranteeing access to health care and promoting a relatively equitable distribution of health resources.&#13;
These systems were successful in promoting certain types of preventive services such as immunizations&#13;
and providing access to care in rural areas, and, until recently, resulted in relatively good health outcomes&#13;
given the amounts of money spent. However, with the epidemiological transition and the resulting&#13;
changing composition of illness from infectious diseases to chronic conditions, system performance has&#13;
been disappointing and inefficiencies, both clinical and economic, along with the dismal economic&#13;
situation in all FSU countries have resulted in very limited gains, and, indeed in some areas, in declines&#13;
in the health status of the population when compared to either western or other middle income countries.&#13;
1.7    The proposed Health Sector Reform Project in the Kyrgyz Republic is designed to assist the&#13;
Kyrgyz Government in the reform of its health care financing and delivery system. The Project takes&#13;
as given the underlying economic situation of the country, the basic epidemiological status of the&#13;
population, and the inherent strengths and weaknesses in the current health care financing and delivery&#13;
system. A set of health reformn goals have been set forth in the Government's MANAS Health Care&#13;
Reform Program', and this proposed IDA funded multi-component project targets the major causes of&#13;
death and disability as well as the basic underlying economic and clinical inefficiencies in the current&#13;
health care financing and delivery system. Explicit in the Project's design is the introduction of modem&#13;
clinical practice methods and provider payment reforms separating purchase and payment of health&#13;
services from delivery of care. These changes would improve clinical practice, target the country's major&#13;
health problems, and result in a reconfiguration of the service delivery system which will promote&#13;
efficient use of scarce health resources. Concomitantly, the Project is designed to preserve and strengthen&#13;
the major positive features of the previous centrally planned system, in particular universal access to care&#13;
and a relatively equitable distribution of health resources.&#13;
1.8    The components of the Health Sector Reform Project are developed on the basis of these reform&#13;
goals, weaknesses in the current system, the underlying epidemiological patterns, the current&#13;
configuration of the service delivery system, economic characteristics of the country, and the&#13;
Government's health priorities.&#13;
B. Epidemiological Trends&#13;
1.9    The Kyrgyz Republic's epidemiological profile and underlying health status compares quite&#13;
favorably to many middle income countries. Much of this positive performance can be attributed to the&#13;
strengths of the previous system in terms of widespread availability of basic services, such as children's&#13;
vaccinations, and universal access to care. However, over the last several years deaths from infectious&#13;
diseases tend to be higher, while several indicators of health status have been stagnant or declining.&#13;
1/     The MANAS Health Care Reform Program was a 1994/95 collaboration between the Government, WHO&#13;
and other donors which examined the health status of the Kyrgyz Republic and recommended future&#13;
reforms and priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Overall, cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in both sexes. For males, accidents&#13;
and intoxications, respiratory diseases, cancer, and infectious and parasitic diseases are the major causes&#13;
of death. For females, after cardiovascular disease, the most common causes of death are respiratory&#13;
diseases, cancer, accidents and intoxications, and infectious and parasitic diseases. The system has been&#13;
particularly unsuccessful in dealing with chronic conditions and the underlying epidemiological factors&#13;
affecting adults. Moreover, there are also major weaknesses in the women's reproductive (including the&#13;
matemal) health system, and the system's outdated medical practice patterns are wasting resources and&#13;
appear to be unable to cope with major increases in the incidence of highly infectious diseases such as&#13;
tuberculosis (TB) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&#13;
Mortality&#13;
1.10   While the crude death rate dropped substantially over the past 15 years, it has increased since&#13;
1991 from 6.9 deaths per thousand population to 8.3 in 1994, comparable to the 9.4 rate in the westem&#13;
industrialized Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The crude&#13;
birth rate has declined over the past 15 years from 30 births per thousand population in 1978 to 24.3 in&#13;
1994, but is still almost double the industrialized country rate. The rapid drop in the birth rate between&#13;
1992 and 1994 (28.5 to 24.3) likely reflects the current socio-economic upheaval (Table 1.1).&#13;

Figures for the Kyrgyz Republic on health outcomes are based on the presentation of Dr. T. Meimanaliev, MANAS Health Policy&#13;
Conference, Bishkek, Feb. 20-22, 1995&#13;
G.J. Schieber et al., 'Health System Performance in OECD Countries," Health Affairs, (Fall, 1994), 100-112.&#13;
For Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Countries (OECD) health expenditure figures are for 1992.&#13;
Other data are for 1992 or nearest available year.&#13;
al 1992&#13;
1.11    The infant mortality rate declined from 43 deaths per thousand live births in 1978 to 29.4 in&#13;
1994, still a rate three times higher than that in the industrialized countries. Almost half of all infant&#13;
deaths are due to acute respiratory infections (ARI), 26 percent are due to perinatal causes, and another&#13;
10 percent are due to severe diarrhea. In all, 60 percent of infant deaths are preventable. Since the&#13;
percentages of low birthweight and premature births are comparable to those found in industrialized&#13;
countries, it is apparent that poor maternal care is a major causal factor for these high rates of preventable&#13;
deaths. Over 60 percent of the deaths of children from 1 to 5 years are due to the same causes.&#13;
Accidents are the major cause of death for children aged 5-14, although ARI still accounts for almost 15&#13;
percent of deaths in this age group.&#13;
1.12   Life expectancy at birth has been relatively stable over the last several reported years (e.g. 1990-&#13;
1992). Unfortunately, the last year with accurate data is 1992, since funds were not available to do the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
computations in 1993 (although computations will be done for 1994). In 1992 the Kyrgyz Republic's life&#13;
expectancy at birth for males of 64 years was 9 years below the OECD average and the 72 year figure&#13;
for women was 7 years below the OECD average (Table 1.1). The 1994 figures should provide some&#13;
indication of whether the current economic crisis has significantly affected the longevity of the population&#13;
as is the case in Russia.&#13;
1.13   The main causes of death of young adults 15-24 years of age are motor vehicle accidents,&#13;
suicides, and homicides. However, chronic respiratory diseases are the leading cause of death for women&#13;
15-24, and ischemic heart disease is the second most important cause of death for women. Ischemic heart&#13;
disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women at age 35 and above. Various cancers are&#13;
the second leading cause of death in women 35-54, while accidents, homicides and alcohol intoxication&#13;
are the other major causes of death. Chronic respiratory diseases are also an important cause of death&#13;
for both men and women in the 35-54 age range. For both males and females age 55 and over, after&#13;
ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory infections and cerebrovascular diseases are the main causes&#13;
of death.&#13;
Morbidity&#13;
1.14   Specific diseases, many of which result in illness not death but nevertheless place significant&#13;
burdens on the health system, cause significant losses of productivity, and result in major health risks&#13;
being imposed on the rest of the population. Analyses of morbidity data are difficult due to the lack of&#13;
comprehensive information and the questionable reliability of reported data. Available data indicate two&#13;
areas which show large increases in incidence of morbidity and pose major health threats to the&#13;
population at large: TB and STDs.&#13;
1.15   Sexually transmitted diseases not only pose major public health problems, but also have&#13;
detrimental effects on women's reproductive health. Reported cases of syphilis were 22 per one hundred&#13;
thousand population in 1994, reflecting a ten-fold increase over the 1992 rate of 2.3. While reported&#13;
gonorrhea cases dropped from 44 per hundred thousand population in 1992 to 37.9 in 1993, there is&#13;
strong evidence that detection rates are dropping as people have stopped coming to Government facilities&#13;
for treatment. While there are no officially documented AIDS cases, the current socio-economic situation&#13;
increases the risk of a significant spread of this disease in a health system that is ill prepared from a&#13;
public health or financial perspective to deal with such an epidemic.&#13;
1.16   The tuberculosis situation in the Kyrgyz Republic is also grave. Even during the Soviet period&#13;
tuberculosis case notification and death rates were among the highest of the entire Soviet Union. Since&#13;
1989, case rates have increased annually at an average rate of three percent, and mortality has increased&#13;
annually by eight percent. Taking into account under-reporting, the estimated incidence could be as high&#13;
as 70 cases per hundred thousand and that of sputum smear positive cases as high as 35 per one hundred&#13;
thousand. The largest proportion of cases still occur in the young adult age groups: the most productive&#13;
segment of the population. In 1994, over two-thirds of all cases occurred in persons under 45 years of&#13;
age. The country's TB mortality rate has doubled from 6.7 deaths per hundred thousand population in&#13;
1989 to 13.6 in 1994. In addition to the serious epidemiological situation, drug resistance levels,&#13;
particularly to the most important anti-tuberculosis drugs, are reported to be increasing from the already&#13;
high levels recorded in the mid-1980s. Moreover, treatment patterns are out of date with a heavy reliance&#13;
on inpatient treatment as opposed to newer outpatient approaches.&#13;
1.17   Utilizing available morbidity and mortality data, a burden of disease analysis was done for the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic using a variant of the DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) methodology developed&#13;
for the 1993 World Development Report. The data on DALYs presented in Table 1.2 indicates the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
priority diseases accounting for the highest loss of DALYs. It is to be noted that the DALYs to be gained&#13;
from reduction in some highly infectious conditions, such as TB (or STDs affecting women's reproductive&#13;
health), can be as much as three or four times higher than levels indicated here because of dynamic&#13;
transmission (i.e. the infection of additional persons by an infected person).&#13;

1.18   The burden of disease analysis is combined with cost-effectiveness analysis (see Part VI) to&#13;
identify those areas where the health status of the population can be promoted in the most cost-effective&#13;
way possible (i.e. the possibility of gaining the greatest number of DALYs for the lowest cost).&#13;
C. Health Care Delivery System and Resource Utilization&#13;
1.19   The Kyrgyz health system is characterized by heavy reliance on inpatient and tertiary hospital-&#13;
based care. The emphasis of the health system on costly inpatient care is evident in the large numbers&#13;
of hospital beds and physicians, and high use rates, as compared to western industrialized countries (Table&#13;
1.3). Moreover, norms on facility structural standards, on medical practice, and on staffing and salaries&#13;
perpetuate outmoded medical treatments and economic inefficiency. The number of beds per 1,000&#13;
population has declined from 12 in 1981 to 9.5 in 1994, but is still some 15 percent above the average&#13;
for OECD countries. Similarly, while hospital admissions rates have declined from 25 percent of the&#13;
population being admitted in 1987 to 18 percent in 1994, they are still 20 percent above the average in&#13;
westem industrialized countries. While the average length of hospital stay has declined by about one day&#13;
over the past 15 years to 15.6 days in 1994, slightly above the 14 day OECD average, it has increased&#13;
from a low of 15 days in 1988. The average number of inpatient days of care per year per person has&#13;
declined from 3.6 days in 1978 to 2.8 in 1994, but is still some 15 percent above the OECD average.&#13;
The hospital occupancy has declined from 90 percent in 1978 to 81 percent in 1994, clearly indicating&#13;
significant excess capacity. The Kyrgyz Republic has significantly more beds and far higher use rates&#13;
than most western industrialized countries.&#13;

Other data are for 1992 or nearest available year.&#13;
1.20    Although there is an extensive network of facilities capable of rendering primary and secondary&#13;
levels of services, the bulk of health resources flow to costly inpatient care rather than to outpatient&#13;
primary care settings. The pattern of expenditures for local health budgets, for example, are heavily&#13;
skewed towards hospitals, which primarily provide inpatient care (Table 1.4).&#13;

1.21    As a result, there is virtually no diagnostic capacity and equipment at lower, less costly levels&#13;
of the system. Instead of being able to treat patients at these less expensive levels, these lower levels&#13;
have typically referred patients upwards for treatment at the tertiary level. The major reductions in health&#13;
spending described below are exacerbating the problems of inappropriate referrals to higher levels of the&#13;
system as the already under-resourced lower levels are reported to be suffering from particular shortages&#13;
of consumables, especially pharmaceuticals. As a consequence, the lower facilities have greater incentive&#13;
to refer patients up the chain to the relatively less under-resourced tertiary care levels.&#13;
1.22    The number of physicians per 1,000 population has increased by some 30 percent over the past&#13;
15 years to reach 3.1 in 1994 (of which 0.45 are dentists), somewhat above the OECD average of 2.2.&#13;
More troublesome is the large number of specialists relative to generalists: some 35 percent are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
generalists (therapists and pediatricians), whereas the ratio in many OECD countries (excluding the U.S.)&#13;
is closer to 50-50. The number of physician contacts per year is comparable to the high utilization rates&#13;
in the OECD countries. As in the case of inpatient beds, the Kyrgyz Republic has large numbers of&#13;
physicians and high utilization of physician services.&#13;
1.23   The current system of health service provision is highly specialized and fragmented. The&#13;
population of just over 4.5 million people is serviced by specialized research institutes (Infectious&#13;
Diseases, Cardiology, Oncology, Tuberculosis, Maternal and Child Health, etc.) at the tertiary level;&#13;
specialized tuberculosis and dermatovenereal hospitals and AIDS clinics at the oblast level; and a&#13;
tuberculosis dispensary at the raion level. For example, a woman is not able to go to just one primary&#13;
health facility in order to receive health care for her children and for herself. For gynecological&#13;
problems she must visit a women's consultation clinic; for contraception, a marriage and family clinic;&#13;
for venereological problems, a dermatovenereal clinic; and for AIDS testing, an AIDS clinic. While the&#13;
system is better integrated at the Feldsher/Accoucheur Posts (FAP) and ambulatory level in the rural&#13;
areas, this generally fragmented system is expensive for the country to run and inconvenient to users.&#13;
It wastes scarce resources which could be better channeled into fewer and more integrated programs.&#13;
D. Financing Health Care&#13;
Budgeting System&#13;
1.24   Health financing regulated by budgeting norms based on physical capacity (e.g. numbers of beds&#13;
or numbers of doctors) perpetuates inefficient resource use in the health sector by encouraging&#13;
overstaffing, overbedding, and increased utilization of inpatient services. Combined with the rigidly&#13;
enforced Soviet 18-line budgeting system used to pay medical care providers (hospitals and polyclinics),&#13;
there are no incentives for primary care providers to use cost-effective ambulatory treatment protocols&#13;
or to perform a "gate-keeping" function of screening inappropriate referrals. The reliance on capacity-&#13;
based budgeting and payment norms promotes inefficiency and waste. Although the recent financial crisis&#13;
in the country has weakened the application of capacity norms as the basis of budgeting, a more rational&#13;
system for reimbursing providers that encourages efficiency, as well as improved internal management,&#13;
would need to be clearly defined and instituted.&#13;
Need for National Health Accounts&#13;
1.25   Effective health policy can only be mnade on the basis of understanding the total amount of&#13;
resources being devoted to the health sector: recurrent and capital spending, spending from all public&#13;
sources including Ministries other than the Ministry of Health, enterprises, donors, and private spending&#13;
both legal and informal. National Health Accounts (NHA) provide a frarnework for classifying all&#13;
expenditures by source of funding (e.g. public and private) and by type of service. They provide the&#13;
basis for analyzing changes over time of both the total and the individual components. Ideally spending&#13;
at the oblast and local levels would be analyzed in the same manner. Such accounts are a necessary&#13;
condition for effective policymaking and are an inherent feature of the health systems of all OECD&#13;
countries. Unfortunately, the health accounting systems in FSU countries often do not lend themselves&#13;
to functional classifications or analyses. Moreover, the increasing fragmentation of the financing systems&#13;
in terms of health insurance-based models and private payments has added to the number of flows of&#13;
funds and further obfuscated the spending picture.&#13;
Levels of Public Funding&#13;
1.26   The health system in the Kyrgyz Republic, as elsewhere in the FSU, is predominantly publicly&#13;
financed.   Public funds from  general revenues are allocated through a complex system  of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
intergovermnental tax-sharing and transfers to finance facilities through federal (Republican) and local&#13;
(oblast and raion) level health budgets. Additionally, public enterprises have financed some social&#13;
services, including health facilities.&#13;
1.27   Irrespective of the measures employed, public health spending in the Kyrgyz Republic has fallen&#13;
dramatically since 1990. As shown in Table 1.5, the decline was especially pronounced between 1990-&#13;
1993, with a slight improvement in 1994. Nevertheless, health spending in 1994 is still substantially&#13;
below the 1990 level for all measures. The ratio of public health expenditures to GDP declined from 4.2&#13;
percent of GDP in 1990 to 2.6 percent in 1993 with an increase to 3.6 percent in 1994 (the 1994 public&#13;
health number reflects only the consolidated budget, so if extra-budgetary funds and enterprise spending&#13;
were included, the ratio would be higher). The health to GDP ratio in OECD countries exceeds 8 percent&#13;
on average (Table 1.6).&#13;
1.28   Although health spending as a percentage of GDP is seen to have fallen moderately, the real&#13;
decline in public health funding is far more severe than is indicated by these figures. In real inflation&#13;
adjusted terms, GDP in 1994 was only 50 percent of the 1990 level. Similarly, 1994 real (GDP deflator&#13;
adjusted) health expenditures were only 46 percent of the 1990 level, up from 40 percent of the 1990&#13;
level in 1993. In short, there has been a 50 percent reduction in real output in the Kyrgyz Republic since&#13;
1990, accompanied by a 54 percent reduction in real public health spending. Major reductions in real&#13;
output and their associated tax revenues have caused equivalent reductions in real public health spending.&#13;
1.29   The picture is even more dismal when per person spending is converted into U.S. dollars using&#13;
purchasing power parities (i.e. exchange rates which adjust for cost of living differences across&#13;
countries). In 1990, per capita public health spending in the Kyrgyz Republic was US$156. Spending&#13;
declined to US$133 in 1991, US$74 in 1992, and US$37 in 1993, only one-fourth the 1990 level&#13;
compared to a 1992 OECD average of almost US$1,400 and spending in Turkey of US$156 (Table 1.6).&#13;
Allocation of Financial Resources&#13;
1.30   The Kyrgyz Republic has not opted for generating earmarked revenues for health through&#13;
mandated insurance, unlike some of the other FSU countries. An experiment in this regard is underway&#13;
in one of the oblasts (Issyk-kul), the provider payment reform elements of which are being expanded&#13;
under the proposed IDA Credit. Changes in medical care provider payments are needed to create&#13;
financial incentives for all providers of health services to manage care given to patients more efficiently&#13;
and cost-effectively while improving the quality of health services. Decision-making on the allocation of&#13;
resources should be decentralized so that both providers of health services and the population have more&#13;
responsibility and accountability for the efficient provision of high quality health services.&#13;
1.31   Further, the concepts of paying providers in accordance with the number of persons covered and&#13;
the types of services rendered would establish a clear relationship between the quantity and quality of the&#13;
services dispensed and the financial reimbursement received for those services, and would encourage&#13;
outpatient treatments, and reductions in the length of hospital stays and unnecessary referrals to higher&#13;
levels of care.&#13;
1.32   The advantages of applying this new method of paying health care providers include:&#13;
(i)    Ability to give more health services with current funding levels due to more efficient&#13;
allocation of existing health sector resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
(ii)     Increased confidence in the health sector by businesses and the population leading to&#13;
greater willingness to invest in health;&#13;
(iii)    Increased responsibility and accountability of health providers for the outcome of health&#13;
services;&#13;
(iv)     Increased consumer participation in decisions about their health care;&#13;
(v)      Improvements in the quality of health services;&#13;
(vi)    Increased access to health services for the population; and&#13;
(vii)    Greater satisfaction and prestige for medical professionals, including  attracting  and&#13;
keeping quality professionals.&#13;

1.33    Levels of private funding.  Data from  Goskomstat based on its non-random  Family Budget&#13;
studies of 2,000 families, provide information on the out-of-pocket spending by family members on health&#13;
care. As shown in Table 1.7, data from 1989-1994 indicate that between 0.7 and 1.4 (in 1994) percent&#13;
of per family member expenditures were for health services. Taking the absolute amounts in Kyrgyz&#13;
soms and dividing by total public spending indicates that these out-of-pocket payments are equivalent to&#13;
10-15 percent of public health spending. Since infornal payments may not be correctly reported as health&#13;
spending, it is probable that the private share is somewhat higher. However, even if total (public and&#13;
private) health spending is 20 to 30 percent higher than public spending alone, spending levels are still&#13;
quite low. While informal payments may to some extent be offsetting the reductions in public health&#13;
spending, it is unlikely that they could offset the enormous decline. Likewise, aid from donors is also&#13;
offsetting these declines in health spending, but the magnitude of such assistance is quite small relative&#13;
to total health spending, perhaps on the order of three percent in 1994.&#13;

1.34    Widespread user-charges have not been introduced. The MANAS group is expected to identify&#13;
a basic package of cost-effective services that will be financed publicly with no or minimal user fees.&#13;
Beyond the package, an exemption schedule for the poor and for sufferers of diseases with catastrophic&#13;
expenses would need to be developed, as well as an administrative mechanism for collecting fees. Given&#13;
widespread poverty, already existing formal and informal private outlays and proposed changes towards&#13;
cost-efficient behavior targeting medical providers (rather than users), developing a program of user fees&#13;
is not deemed to be a priority for the health sector at the moment, nor is it likely that significant revenue&#13;
would be generated if at the same time access of the poorest groups to medical care were to be protected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Impact of Funding Crisis&#13;
1.35   The current funding crisis has precipitated a series of changes that impact on all levels of the&#13;
health system. A few of these changes have been beneficial in reforming a chronically overstaffed and&#13;
overutilized health system. Others have actually reduced the quality of the service provided and seek to&#13;
undermine both the health workers' and general public's confidence in the system. It has been noted that&#13;
the population's health seeking behavior has changed in the last few years with people visiting health&#13;
facilities less often, later in the illness, or not at all. The main reasons for this change in behavior have&#13;
been the lack of drugs in the health facilities, transport problems, mass unemployment reducing demand&#13;
for sick notes, and lack of money to pay the fees for service.&#13;
1.36   The health system is severely constrained by the reduced availability of drugs, equipment,&#13;
spareparts and consumables in all health facilities, particularly at the primary health care level. Health&#13;
facilities maintain a stock of drugs for emergencies and heavy reliance is being placed on humanitarian&#13;
assistance to provide vaccinations and selective priority drugs. Such humanitarian assistance is sporadic,&#13;
however, resulting in frequent acute shortages of vaccinations and priority drugs. There are many&#13;
examples of the problems created by this drug shortage, and people are selling off assets (cows, horses)&#13;
to buy drugs, or turning to faith healers and herbal remedies. The health system is collapsing due to lack&#13;
of drugs and supplies, particularly at the primary health care level. In the current situation most patients&#13;
must provide bedding, food, drugs and syringes for themselves and cover the costs of transport. This&#13;
collapse is further exacerbated by the use of outmoded treatment regimes, which often include&#13;
polypharmacy and long periods of unnecessary hospitalization.&#13;
1.37   Emergency services have been protected so far, although health officials voice doubts about how&#13;
long this emergency cover can be maintained. Emergency surgery (i.e. cesarian sections and other&#13;
emergency obstetric care, acute appendicitis, strangulated hernia repair, acute trauma, etc.) continues but&#13;
patients must provide many items. Routine surgery (chronic hernia repair, gallbladder removal, gastric&#13;
ulcer surgery, etc.) has virtually ceased. Many patients with chronic illnesses (chronic bronchitis, angina,&#13;
diabetes, epilepsy, kidney disease, etc.) have stopped visiting health facilities because of the lack of&#13;
drugs, and the introduction of a fee for some services. The lack of essential drugs for public health&#13;
priority programns such as TB and STD control programs signal a breakdown in the basic health system.&#13;
1.38   Health worker salary levels are compressed and very low (chief doctor US$25/month, hospital&#13;
doctors US$13/month, nurses US$11/month), and payment has sometimes been delayed by several&#13;
months. Several non-cash payment systems have been introduced in different raions to compensate for&#13;
the lack of revenue flow. Health workers receive part of their salaries in the form of produce from local&#13;
enterprises (wheat, cloth etc.) or vouchers. Some health staff compensate for these low salaries by&#13;
working an extra shift in their health facilities. Many compensate by cultivating their gardens to produce&#13;
extra fruit and vegetables for home consumption or sale in the market. Some of the most talented doctors&#13;
have left to work in other jobs (mainly business), or migrated to other countries. Mass unemployment&#13;
has, however, prevented many health workers from seeking alternative employment. The health facilities&#13;
appear to be adequately staffed, despite these low salaries and long delays in payment. Many health&#13;
workers are motivated and committed to their health service system, but are finding it a challenge to&#13;
continue working without drugs for their patients.&#13;
1.39    A shortage of gasoline and spareparts have contributed to a reduction in the number of&#13;
ambulance teams, coinciding with a reduction in the public transport system. Pregnant women are now&#13;
advised to keep a stock of gasoline in their homes for the ambulance or private vehicles. Disturbingly,&#13;
some health workers report an increase in the number of home deliveries. Supervision of health staff by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Ministry, oblast and raion health officials remains intact, although reductions in public transport and&#13;
gasoline shortages have substantially reduced the frequency of visits.&#13;
1.40   A variety of cost-saving measures have been introduced by different health facilities to&#13;
compensate the reduction in their budgets: beds and staff have been reduced; day patient services and fee&#13;
for service have been introduced; some hospitals now grow wheat and make their own bread; hospital&#13;
pharmacies have been set up to produce infusion solutions and herbal remedies; garbage is removed by&#13;
hospital staff in preference to paying outside contractors; coal heaters have been replaced by electric&#13;
heaters; and physical therapy has partially replaced drug therapy for some ailments. The chief doctors&#13;
and their staff have shown great resourcefulness in their attempts to reduce costs, while trying to maintain&#13;
the quality of patient care.&#13;
E. The Current Status of Physical Facilities&#13;
1.41   A comprehensive review on the status of health facilities in the country, with a particular focus&#13;
on those at the PHC level, revealed that adequate funds are no longer available to pay for running and&#13;
maintaining buildings, plant and equipment making it increasingly difficult to maintain acceptable levels&#13;
of efficiency and quality of the facilities. A large part of the equipment is not working due to shortages&#13;
of spareparts and a widespread lack of maintenance. Furthermore, essential consumables needed to&#13;
operate the equipment are not available or in short supply, seriously detracting from the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of the medical services being provided.&#13;
1.42   Even though as a result of the mentioned shortages and inefficiencies buildings and equipment&#13;
are not adequate to respond to medical needs, they also represent a fixed cost to the Government in terms&#13;
of personnel and energy consumption. A reform program aimed at improving efficiency and decreasing&#13;
waste will require the closing of some facilities and the adaptation, remodeling and re-equipping of other&#13;
establishments. At present, there are very few norms and standards regarding physical infrastructure that&#13;
could respond to current needs. With respect to the human resources that would be needed, while in the&#13;
past there was apparently a well functioning hierarchy of technical and administrative expertise to support&#13;
the Ministry of Health's investment activities, including engineers, architects and builders, this is no&#13;
longer the case. The few remaining members in the Office of Capital Investments are not well trained&#13;
to manage the technical changes that will be required to reform the network and to bring the facilities up&#13;
to modern standards, while achieving savings. The Central Office for maintenance has been completely&#13;
disbanded.&#13;
1.43   At present there is no overview of the status of buildings and equipment and it is not possible to&#13;
make overall plans and establish priorities for reform and maintenance activities of the whole public&#13;
health network. The scarce resources available should be used for rehabilitation and for organizing an&#13;
updated system of maintenance, once decisions are taken on partial or total closing of some facilities and&#13;
on remodeling work and installation of new equipment. For this change of focus, however, a significant&#13;
reorganization is required including retraining of a small core of technical staff in planning and managing&#13;
the reform and the improvement of the existing health physical infrastructure network. This may also&#13;
require contracting of private sector expertise.&#13;
F. The Current Status of Pharmaceuticals&#13;
1.44   Prior to independence, The Kyrgyz Republic received most of its pharmaceuticals from the FSU.&#13;
With the breakup of the Soviet Union, pharmaceutical availability was severely disrupted. With the&#13;
collapse of the economy, the country cannot afford to buy drugs at market prices. To compound these&#13;
problems, state monopolies on procurement and distribution, outmoded storage facilities, and outmoded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
lists of clinically inappropriate drugs have all exacerbated the problems of pharmaceutical supply. The&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic was also left without a quality control system for drugs because determination of safety&#13;
and efficacy of drugs was done by the Ministry of Health of the USSR in Moscow. To make matters&#13;
worse, the high costs of outpatient drugs result in individuals being inappropriately hospitalized in order&#13;
to receive free pharmaceuticals. The situation is so severe that for most non-emergency cases, hospitals&#13;
can no longer afford to provide drugs, and individuals frequently must provide their own drugs in order&#13;
to receive appropriate inpatient treatment. An adequate supply of essential drugs is critical to the&#13;
effectiveness of any health care system, but it is particularly important at a time when resources are being&#13;
shifted from inpatient to outpatient facilities and from curative to preventive care. However, in order to&#13;
assure an adequate supply of essential drugs, it is not enough simply to finance the purchase of additional&#13;
medicines. Without fundamental improvements in pharmaceutical management, much of the potential&#13;
benefit of increased physical supply is likely to be squandered, and none of the benefit is likely to be&#13;
sustainable once the additional funds have been spent. Moreover, the danger of ineffective, or even&#13;
unsafe, medicines being supplied may be rising, in light of the worsening economic conditions, the&#13;
growing shortage of drugs, and the unscrupulousness of low-quality manufacturers. A more serious&#13;
source of waste is undisciplined, cost-ineffective public spending. Despite cuts in Government funds for&#13;
drugs, the funds that are available still are being used to buy an excessively large number of drugs, many&#13;
of which have never been proven to be effective. Expensive branded drugs are sometimes purchased&#13;
instead of less expensive, therapeutically equivalent generic products. And, because a large number of&#13;
different drugs are purchased in relatively small quantities, the demand for many important, widely used&#13;
medicines often is not met, while the price that must be paid to obtain these drugs is higher than would&#13;
be the case if larger quantities of fewer drugs were purchased through competitive bidding. Reform of&#13;
pharmaceutical procurement and management is critical. Lists of essential clinically effective drugs based&#13;
on the recommendations of WHO must be established, and effective procurement and distribution&#13;
networks must be put in place. The safety and efficacy of the country's pharmaceutical supply must be&#13;
assured.&#13;
G. Need for Long-Term Reform&#13;
1.45   Based on the preceding analysis, the following are identified as the main areas of the health&#13;
system where problems exist:&#13;
(a)    overemphasis on inpatient and tertiary care, with poor diagnostic capacity, treatment&#13;
protocols, pharmaceutical supplies and facilities at ambulatory levels;&#13;
(b)    federal norms promoting outdated clinical practices and inefficient facility configurations;&#13;
(c)    large numbers of low quality medical treatments, and an excess of hospital beds;&#13;
(d)    rigid 18-line budget procedures for paying polyclinics, hospitals and salaries for all&#13;
medical care personnel, which provide no incentives for economic efficiency in resource&#13;
use or referral patterns and perpetuate imbalances toward inpatient care;&#13;
(e)    outmoded health programs in a number of important areas such as maternal and child&#13;
health (MCH), TB, STDs, and adult health;&#13;
(f)   lack of an up-to-date essential drug list, poorly structured monopolistic state procurement,&#13;
storage, and distribution systems, and shortages of essential drugs;&#13;
(g)    limited technology and shortages of basic equipment and supplies; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
(h)    history of chronic underfunding exacerbated by the current economic situation.&#13;
1.46   As a consequence, the quality of health services and effective access to these services has declined&#13;
in recent years (as evident in falling utilization rates).  Total resource availability has declined&#13;
considerably and the remaining resources are utilized in a highly inefficient way. The incentive structure&#13;
underlying the resource allocation system in the sector contain limited incentives for inducing cost-&#13;
effective behavior by medical care providers.&#13;
1.47   The issue in the Kyrgyz Republic's health system in the short-run, therefore, is to make the best&#13;
possible use of the limited resources available, while laying the basis for future enhancements in areas&#13;
such as quality assurance, accreditation of health facilities and new forms of financial resource&#13;
mobilization. The major areas of reform in this first stage are identified as:&#13;
(a)    emphasizing cost-effectiveness criteria in public financing of health service delivery: this&#13;
will require that resources are channeled to diseases which have a high burden and which&#13;
can be treated through cost-effective ambulatory protocols;&#13;
(b)    re-orientation of resource use towards ambulatory primary care and away from inpatient&#13;
and tertiary care: this will require strengthening of ambulatory care through investments&#13;
in new ambulatory treatment protocols, diagnostic capacity, supply of essential drugs, and&#13;
rehabilitation of facilities for expanded ambulatory care;&#13;
(c)    ensuring that the focus on cost-effective ambulatory care is sustainable through changes&#13;
in the incentive structure facing medical care providers: this will require separation of&#13;
purchasing and provision of services with the introduction of a new payment system for&#13;
providers, such as a capitation-based payment system, which will place responsibility for&#13;
cost containment on the providers and will encourage use of cost-effective ambulatory&#13;
protocols and avoidance of inappropriate referrals, while maintaining pre-agreed,&#13;
specified service quality levels;&#13;
(d)    introducing mechanisms for cost-effective procurement of major consumables, especially&#13;
pharmaceuticals: this will require identification of clinically effective and cost-effective&#13;
essential drugs and the strengthening of pharmaceuticals regulatory bodies; and&#13;
(e)    facility and staff rationalization for the health sector in order to realize savings from the&#13;
shift in service provision from inpatient to ambulatory methods: this will require&#13;
closure/consolidation of facilities and re-training/release of some staff, especially at the&#13;
tertiary level and at inviable small inpatient facilities.&#13;
1.48   These reforms would be expected to generate structural efficiency (i.e. achievement of health&#13;
gains with least cost), sustain these cost-savings over time, as well as achieving health gains, ceteris&#13;
paribus, through improvements in the effectiveness and quality of services provided.&#13;
H. Government's Goals and Policies for the Health Sector&#13;
Goals&#13;
1.49   Like other member nations of the World Health Organization, the Kyrgyz Republic has developed&#13;
health goals that it wants to achieve by the year 2000. The Kyrgyz Republic's State Program For A&#13;
Healthy Nation Targets For the Year 2000 include: (a) reduction of Infant Mortality by 25 percent; (b)&#13;
reduction of Child Mortality under five by one-third; (c) reduction of Maternal Mortality by 25 percent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(d) reduction of Cardiovascular Diseases and Cancer by 15 percent; (e) reduction of Mortality by&#13;
Diabetes by 20 percent; (f) reduction of the Crude Mortality Rate by 15 percent; (g) reduction of the&#13;
incidence of tuberculosis by 10 percent; and (h) reduction of the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases&#13;
by 50 percent. Within the context of the MANAS Health Care Reform Program, the Government is&#13;
attempting to develop a rationalistic framework for developing solutions to these serious health problems&#13;
of the country, which have been exacerbated by the difficulties of the transition. By December 31, 1996&#13;
MOH would, as part of project implementation, present to the Association for review and comments, the&#13;
MANAS Health Care Reform Program and a schedule of rationalization of health facilities and thereafter&#13;
carry out the program in accordance with that schedule, taking into account the comments of the&#13;
Association.&#13;
Policy&#13;
1.50   Before negotiations the Government provided the International Development Association (IDA),&#13;
hereafter referred to as the Association, with a draft policy statement outlining its health sector reform&#13;
strategy. This policy statement was reviewed and discussed during negotiations. Signature of the policy&#13;
statement in a form acceptable to the Association was a condition of Board Presentation. The Prime&#13;
Minister transmitted the policy statement with a signed letter, dated April 5, 1996, which summarized&#13;
the policy's main points. A copy of this letter is contained in Annex 1. The full policy statement and&#13;
letter in both Russian and English are contained in Annex 15. The statement contains undertakings:&#13;
(a)    That during the execution of the Project the level of annual State budgetary expenditures&#13;
for the health sector will remain executed at a level, not less in real, inflation-adjusted&#13;
terms than such total executed expenditures in 1994. Savings resulting from carrying out&#13;
the Project will be put back into the health sector.&#13;
(b)    That the health sector needs to be rationalized and modernized and a first step will be&#13;
taken during the time the Project is implemented by merging specialty departments and&#13;
health facilities; increase the emphasis on primary and outpatient care and reduction of&#13;
health personnel, hospitals and hospital beds. As part of this restructuring,&#13;
(i)    The STD and AIDS programs will be integrated in other primary care programs&#13;
and new treatment methods and protocols will be introduced to enhance&#13;
ambulatory treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.&#13;
(ii)   If results of the pilot projects on ambulatory treatment of TB are satisfactory,&#13;
introduce ambulatory treatment as standard treatment nationwide; reallocate&#13;
current tuberculosis specialists from tuberculosis in-patient facilities to primary&#13;
health care facilities; and phased closure of TB sanatoria in the country.&#13;
(iii)   Emphasis will shift from new construction to rehabilitation of health facilities and&#13;
from specialty hospitals to integrated hospitals.&#13;
(iv)   Allocations in the local and national budgets for repair and maintenance of health&#13;
facilities will be maintained at the same executed real level of the 1994 budgets&#13;
and further that these allocations will be utilized only for the purposes intended.&#13;
(c)    That the population will have a free choice of health care provider/physician.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(d)    That the Borrower will take all necessary legal, organizational and financial steps to&#13;
ensure that only drugs that are safe and proven effectiveness will be manufactured,&#13;
distributed, sold, and used in the Kyrgyz Republic; that the borrower will establish an&#13;
Essential Drugs Program, including a limited list of essential drugs; that the Goverrnent&#13;
intends to require that government funds be used, directly or indirectly, to finance the&#13;
purchase of only drugs on the approved essential drugs list; and that the Government will&#13;
continue to eliminate obstacles to the growth of a financially stable, well-regulated system&#13;
of private pharmacies and pharmaceutical distributors.&#13;
I. Other Donor Activities and Coordination&#13;
1.51   The major donor agencies working in the Kyrgyz Republic are USAID, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA&#13;
and UNDP. USAID, UNICEF and UNDP all have small country offices in Bishkek. USAID has a&#13;
regional office in Almaty and the UNICEF country office is supervised by the Central Asian office of&#13;
UNICEF in Islamabad, Pakistan. UNFPA plans to set up a regional office with a regional advisor. GTZ,&#13;
the German Goverrunent's technical assistance agency, and DANIDA, the Danish Govermnent's&#13;
development agency also have small offices with a resident country program officer. ODA's Know How&#13;
Fund is also very active in the health sector in the country, and is expected to provide technical assistance&#13;
to the Government to rationalize health facilities in Bishkek city. Many smaller agencies are working on&#13;
emergency food programs (Red Cross, Mercy Corps International, etc.) Annex 14 provides a summary&#13;
of agencies involved in health reform activities, drug programs, children's health, women's reproductive&#13;
health, and a description of the coordination of these activities and the proposed Project. Collaboration&#13;
agreements have been reached with UNICEF on the Project's support for acute respiratory infections and&#13;
the control of diarrheal disease (ARI/CDD), and GTZ on activities related to the promotion of adult&#13;
health and lifestyles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
PART II. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.1    A review of the analysis of medical systems performed in Russia and the other FSU countries&#13;
reveals a pattern which is symptomatic of the legacy of Soviet medical practices. First, the lack of&#13;
discipline inherent in any system where cost is not a factor produced a medical system highly skewed to&#13;
tertiary level care and hospitalization in specialized and functionally independent facilities with staff and&#13;
overhead costs out of proportion to patient load. Incentives were biased away from services towards&#13;
facilities and hospital stays, and providers were paid on a fixed salary. This system has proved not only&#13;
to be unaffordable under the present fiscal austerity, but unworkable in a market economy. The provider&#13;
payments component of the Project proposes to deal directly with these issues. Second, lack of exposure&#13;
to and incorporation of western medical practices has resulted in medical practices and protocols which&#13;
are not in accord with modern developments. The current cadre of medical professionals need to have&#13;
their training upgraded and expanded. A significant effort is undertaken in the Project to introduce&#13;
modern methods, materials, publications, ambulatory techniques, and recent research findings to the&#13;
primary health care sector. Third, the level and quality of physical construction in the sector has&#13;
emphasized new construction almost to the virtual exclusion of maintenance and upgrading of present&#13;
facilities. Community involvement has been generally absent. The facility rehabilitation component&#13;
focuses on establishing methods and administrative steps to introduce the concept of estate management&#13;
with community participation in primary health facilities. Fourth, throughout the FSU the actual level&#13;
of financing directed to health has suffered as the federal level has divested responsibility and financial&#13;
support to the oblast and raion authorities, and central financial authorities have been under pressure from&#13;
the IMF with regard to fiscal deficits. There is strong pressure on medical authorities to rationalize&#13;
expenditures within a shrinking annual allocation. The Project seeks to establish a "floor" for budgetary&#13;
allocations to health, as well as encourage the hard task of reducing physical and staffing levels to fit&#13;
current needs without reducing quality of services. The Kyrgyz Republic, in many respects of size,&#13;
commitment to reform, and ability to make decisions offers an excellent opportunity to attack these issues&#13;
and provide lessons for its larger neighbors who are all facing the same challenges.&#13;
2.2    With respect to implementation this is the first lending operation for the health sector in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. In general, the Kyrgyz Republic's health sector shares the same characteristics of other&#13;
FSU countries, i.e. the dispersion of responsibilities among various levels of Government, lack of&#13;
coordination among various entities involved in health care, inexperience with Bank procedures, weak&#13;
implementation capacity, and a resistance to credit-funded external technical assistance. In the area of&#13;
pharmaceuticals, a Rehabilitation Credit had an original allocation of US$1.5 million to finance imported&#13;
drugs, but due to lengthy delays and changing priorities in Government the preparation and finalization&#13;
of list of drugs to be purchased, combined with offers of donations from donors, resulted in only&#13;
US$100,000 of the total amount allocated being used. For small-scale rehabilitation of facilities, the&#13;
Social Safety Net Project has almost completed rehabilitation on 48 sites around the country. The lessons&#13;
learned would be applied to the rehabilitation activities under the proposed Health Project, including the&#13;
early refocusing of MOH on rehabilitation and supervision of works, together with outside engineers, and&#13;
development of simplified bidding documents for rehabilitation works. Finally, the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit of the Social Safety Net Project has gained valuable experience with Bank procedures, and the PCU&#13;
would perform, on a contract basis, the procurement, disbursement and reporting functions for the&#13;
MOH.&#13;
2.3    The use of the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) methodology presented in the World Bank&#13;
1993 World Development Report provided an excellent tool of analysis to select those medical conditions&#13;
which had the highest priority, and to choose only those interventions which are both cost-effective and&#13;
can be provided in an outpatient care setting. Special efforts have been made to incorporate the lessons&#13;
of other donors, and one component - provider payments - is a direct extension of the USAID-funded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
demonstration project in Issyk-kul, which is part of a larger effort involving several countries of the FSU.&#13;
The lessons learned throughout the FSU will be incorporated as they emerge. The Bank's Poverty&#13;
Assessment and Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic calls for the major causes of death and disability to be&#13;
targeted, and the basic underlying inefficiencies which remain in the health care system to be addressed.&#13;
In particular, modern clinical practices will need to be introduced, along with new incentive-based&#13;
payment mechanisms for medical service providers. The goals and strategy of the proposed Project are&#13;
entirely congruent with that strategy, and with the Government's health priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
PART III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Concept&#13;
3.1    The objectives of the Project are: the reform and improvement of the Borrower's health care&#13;
system; improvement of the health status of the population; improvement of the clinical effectiveness of&#13;
the service delivery system; improvement of the economic efficiency of the delivery system; and&#13;
extension of access of appropriate care, enhancement of the quality of care, and assurance of the long-run&#13;
financial viability of the system.&#13;
3.2    The Project's objectives are also goals which are fully consistent with those developed under the&#13;
first phase of the MANAS Health Care Reform Program. Policies and programs developed to achieve&#13;
these goals would be monitored throughout the Project to assure that they also deal with the underlying&#13;
social and economic problems that undennine health status, as well as with the public goods aspects of&#13;
certain health services where the benefits and/or costs to society far exceed those to the individual (e.g.&#13;
immunizations, TB, and STDs), thereby necessitating state financing of goods and services provided in&#13;
these policy areas. Effective policy development must also deal with the existing economic constraints,&#13;
and base policies on cost-effectiveness criteria. Policies also deal with inefficiencies in the basic system,&#13;
whether they relate to ineffective clinical practice or economic inefficiency. Long-run sustainability and&#13;
maximum improvements (or reductions in the rate of decline) in health status must be achieved in the&#13;
context of the economic realities facing the country as a whole, and the health sector in particular.&#13;
3.3    This proposed four and a half year Project will focus on: primary health care, limited facilities&#13;
rehabilitation, a medical care provider payment system, and pharmaceutical management. The primary&#13;
health care focus of the proposed Project corresponds with these priorities. The interventions envisaged&#13;
under the Project are both clinically and cost-effective.  Moreover, focusing on primary care,&#13;
rationalizing drug procurement and ensuring the availability of essential drugs, and providing financial&#13;
incentives for system restructuring through a medical care provider payment component will result in&#13;
cost-effective improvements in the country's health status and improvements in the clinical effectiveness&#13;
and economic efficiency of the health system, all within the context of the current economic constraints.&#13;
3.4   Increasing the effective utilization of the primary health care system will have the effect of&#13;
decreasing demand at the hospital level. In conjunction with this decreased demand, provider paymnent&#13;
schemes as proposed in the Project will accelerate the closure of inefficient hospitals. Increasing&#13;
utilization of the primary health care system will not occur solely by training providers. A reliable drug&#13;
system operating within the Government sphere is imperative if demand for and utilization of primary&#13;
health care services is to be sufficient enough to decrease hospital utilization. Another activity encourages&#13;
more effective and efficient utilization of the primary health care system through the repair, refurbishment&#13;
and minor alteration of select ambulatory facilities.&#13;
3.5    The medical care provider payment component will furnish the financial incentives needed to&#13;
support the changes in clinical practice and the restructuring of the delivery system inherent in the other&#13;
components. It will consist of a new system under which the oblasts, acting as purchasing agents, will&#13;
make payments to providers on the basis of pre-agreed performance indicators. During the phase-in&#13;
period, payments would be made on a capitation basis. This approach will promote the long-run financial&#13;
sustainability of the system and rationalize the current base by promoting primary and outpatient care,&#13;
while providing strong incentives to eliminate unnecessary inpatient bed capacity. It reinforces the other&#13;
components which also promote and improve the quality of outpatient care through the availability of&#13;
essential drugs and redesigned outpatient practice protocols. Physicians will assume responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
managing the care of their patients and eliminating unnecessary referrals to other specialists, for&#13;
diagnostic tests, and to hospitals, and in tum, will be rewarded with increased remuneration.&#13;
3.6    The pharmaceutical management component of the Project will finance the purchase and&#13;
distribution of a large quantity of essential drugs, in an effort to improve fundamentally the availability&#13;
of needed medicines. The procurement of drugs, however, will be done only in the context of far-&#13;
reaching reforms in pharmaceutical management aimed at guaranteeing "sustainability" so that&#13;
improvements in the supply of drugs -- or the increment of "health" produced by a given amount of&#13;
resources -- will last long after the Project has ended.&#13;
B. Project Desciiption&#13;
3.7    Through working with officials of the Kyrgyz Government, the MANAS team, and other donors&#13;
active in the sector, a four component Project has been developed as follows: (a) primary health care;&#13;
(b) facilities rehabilitation; (c) medical care provider payment system; and (d) pharmaceutical&#13;
management. This Project is designed to achieve the basic goals of health care reform within the current&#13;
economic and institutional constraints of the Republic. It focuses on the major burdens of disease in the&#13;
country and is designed to deal with the most egregious inefficiencies in the service delivery system. By&#13;
emphasizing cost-effective interventions, modern clinical practices, and major structural reform, the&#13;
design recognizes the current economic realities facing the system and provides the basis for long-run&#13;
financial sustainability. The Government has provided the Association with a policy statement, acceptable&#13;
to the Association, outlining its health sector reform strategy, reaffirming its commitment to health&#13;
reforns expressed in its "Master Plan for Future Developments of the Republic's Health Care System,"&#13;
einphasizing reform in primary health care, pharmnaceuticals and testing of different modalities of provider&#13;
payments as a way of seeking efficient solutions for resource allocation. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that the Borrower would carry out an action plan agreed with the Association and in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Association, as part of project execution.&#13;
3.8    An important activity of the PHC component in support of all the subcomponents is the&#13;
production of mass media materials for the general public, aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles in the&#13;
family and the rational utilization of health facilities. Booklets will be widely distributed to the general&#13;
public from primary health care facilities. This will complement an extensive countrywide program&#13;
supported by the German Development Agency (GTZ) covering, among other things, adult lifestyle&#13;
issues. Under the Project local technical assistance will be provided for computer software training and&#13;
the production of mass media materials. GTZ will provide technical assistance for the production of&#13;
booklets, TV and radio programs for the general public.&#13;
Component A: Primary Health Care&#13;
(US$4.0 million total project cost)&#13;
3.9    The objective of the Primary Health Care component is to reorient health services away from&#13;
hospitals and towards upgraded primary health care centers. To facilitate this process, interventions in&#13;
this component will provide training to upgrade the skills of primary health care workers, provide them&#13;
with basic clinical equipment and ensure them an adequate supply of drugs. The longer term objective&#13;
of the Primary Health Care Component is to develop a more cost-effective health care program through&#13;
the reduction of hospitals, beds and staff from the merging of specialty hospitals (tuberculosis,&#13;
dernatovenereal, children's, matemity, infectious diseases, etc.) into the general hospital system at the&#13;
tertiary, secondary and primary health care levels. Before negotiatons the Government has concluded&#13;
that no legislation restricts different hospital functions to separate facilities nor forbids the expansion of&#13;
the range of health services provided at the primary health care level, including ambulatory treatment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
STDs and TB. Not later than December 31, 1996 MOH will establish new case management guidelines&#13;
for ambulatory treatment of STDs and TB, as part of project implementation.&#13;
3.10   The PHC Component would offer nationwide coverage and would be focused on the primary&#13;
health care facilities which provide health care to the country's 43 raions outside of Bishkek, through&#13;
three main interventions: (a) redefinition of medical treatment protocols; (b) training of health care&#13;
workers in priority health interventions; and (c) development of a mass media campaign for the general&#13;
public to support the health reform activities. The MOH would have overall responsibility for the PHC&#13;
component in close coordination with oblast and raion health authorities. The Technical Coordination&#13;
Committee (TCC), organized to support the technical implementation of the Project, has one full-time&#13;
advisor to coordinate all PHC activities (Annex 6 describes implementation arrangements.)&#13;
3.11   There are three subcomponents under the PHC component: (a) strengthening women's&#13;
reproductive health; (b) acute respiratory infections and control of diarrheal diseases (ARI/CDD); and,&#13;
(c) tuberculosis control. These programs cover the major health problems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic,&#13;
namely high maternal, perinatal and infant mortality rates, and rising levels of syphilis and tuberculosis.&#13;
Reductions in maternal mortality will be achieved by upgrading prenatal, delivery and postnatal care, both&#13;
in hospital and at the primary health care level; and to prevent deaths from eclampsia, hemorrhage and&#13;
sepsis. Perinatal mortality will be reduced by upgrading the monitoring of pregnancy and labor, and&#13;
improving neonatal resuscitation practices to prevent deaths and disability from newborn hypoxia and&#13;
brain trauma. The component also focuses on reducing the spread of tuberculosis and syphilis, two of the&#13;
most serious infectious diseases, through the introduction of ambulatory care for treating these conditions,&#13;
and a public health media campaign on adult health lifestyle issues.&#13;
Subcomponent A.1: Strengthening Women's Reproductive Health Management&#13;
(US$1.8 million total project cost)&#13;
3.12   The specific goals of this subcomponent are: provision of basic maternal care to all pregnant&#13;
women, and reduction of the following conditions associated with pregnancy and delivery: maternal&#13;
deaths due to obstetric complications such as hemorrhage, eclampsia, sepsis, and obstructed labor;&#13;
anemia; neonatal deaths and disabilities associated with birth asphyxia and hypothermia; and, reduction&#13;
of anemia and of complications of sexually transmitted diseases among pregnant women, as well as of&#13;
ophthalmia neonatorum among infants. Evaluation of improvements in these conditions would be done&#13;
using as a basis estinates of present levels of incidence, and comparing these values with the&#13;
corresponding statistics of subsequent years (indicators for evaluation are presented in Annex 11). This&#13;
subcomponent would complement the work of other donors, including UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, German&#13;
Government (KFW), Central Asian Partners, BASICS, etc.&#13;
3.13   The subcomponent will help develop national case management guidelines (or protocols) for the&#13;
Mother/Baby package, following WHO and UNICEF guidelines and will increase training capacity within&#13;
the country to implement these guidelines. Before negotations, the Government has concluded that no&#13;
legislation restricts the adoption of the WHO Guidelines on maternal and child health and STDs, related&#13;
to confidential, anonymous care. Not later than December 31, 1996 MOH will establish new national&#13;
case management guidelines for women's reproductive health management, as part of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.14   Main topics for training would include: medical and nursing care of normal and high-risk&#13;
pregnancies and deliveries (including use of partograms); medical and nursing care of newborns&#13;
(including resuscitation); encouraging breastfeeding during neonatal period; application of WHO's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
"Mother-Baby" package; principles and practices of family planning; case management of sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases; and management and supervision of public health programs.&#13;
3.15   A system of countrywide training centers will be established consisting of the Centers of&#13;
Continuous Medical Education (CCMEs) in Bishkek and Osh, six Model Hospitals, six Model City&#13;
Polyclinics-one in each oblast--and six model FAPs, also one in each oblast. These model training&#13;
centers will provide "hands on" clinical training experience in health facilities using the new treatment&#13;
protocols. A core of trainers will be trained at the national, oblast and raion levels and printed training&#13;
manuals provided to trainees. Study tours will be funded for a limited number of key health personnel.&#13;
The training will be institutionalized within several key Government establishments to ensure a regular&#13;
update of case management guidelines and a program of continued education for health personnel.&#13;
3.16   The training will take place at the 20 facilities listed above, and will be carried out in three&#13;
phases: Phase 1. Training of National and Oblast Trainers; Phase 2. Training of Raion Trainers; Phase&#13;
3. Training of Primary Health Care Teams. The Project will fund all three phases for the Women's&#13;
Reproductive Health Program.&#13;
3.17   The  following  personnel would  be  trained  through  the  Project:  80  trainers  (20&#13;
obstetricianl/gynecologists, 20 pediatricians, 20 neonatologists, 20 STD specialists) who would in tum&#13;
train up to 2,000 health personnel nationwide. Special emphasis would be placed on strengthening the&#13;
MOH central, oblast and raion management to ensure adequate oversight and monitoring of the process.&#13;
The focus of training would be on the obstetric and pediatric staff working in the country's 43 raion&#13;
hospitals; and primary health care staff working in the country's peripheral health units.&#13;
3.18   The CCME in Bishkek City, will act as the focus for all training activities in the Project and will&#13;
be responsible for training coordination nationwide. In Phase I of the training program, the national and&#13;
oblast trainers will receive training at the CCME in Bishkek City. The CCME has a sub-department in&#13;
Osh City, which will play a coordinating role for the Southern area of the Kyrgyz Republic. In Phase&#13;
2, both CCMEs will be responsible for training raion trainers. The following set of office and training&#13;
equipment will be provided by the Project for each of the CCMEs: computer, printer &amp; software (plus&#13;
training), heavy duty photocopier, fax machine, videocamera, television, VCR, slide projector, overhead&#13;
projector and screen, and 2 flipchart stands.&#13;
3.19   Three health facilities in each oblast (a multispeciality Oblast Hospital, a nearby city polyclinic&#13;
and a FAP) will be upgraded with equipment and staff training and used as model health facilities for&#13;
training purposes. During project implementation and not later than December 31, 1996 MOH would:&#13;
(i) combine services in the health facilities selected as Oblast Model Polyclinics where training under the&#13;
PHC component will be carried out, so that services for pediatrics, women's health and general adult&#13;
health will be offered in one building; and (ii) ensure timely supply and regular replenishment to all&#13;
facilities where training is carried out under the PHC component, of project financed equipment, drugs&#13;
and other materials, and ensure that part of these drugs are provided free of charge to personnel of FAPs&#13;
and ambulatory centers, participating in the training programs as trainees. The practical training will&#13;
consist of maternal and perinatal care and sexually transmitted diseases. Hospital-based specialist staff&#13;
will receive additional training in neonatal resuscitation and obstetric care. The following sets of training&#13;
equipment will be provided to each Oblast Model Hospital: television, VCR, slide projector, overhead&#13;
projector and screen, 2 flipchart stands. A limited list of clinical equipment, drugs and supplies will be&#13;
provided to the upgraded model hospitals, polyclinics and FAPs. In Phase 3 of the training program,&#13;
Primary Health Care Teams from the peripheral FAPs, Rural Physician Ambulatories (SVAs), polyclinics&#13;
and rural hospitals will receive training from the raion and oblast trainers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
3.20   A set of basic clinical equipment will be provided to 170 ambulatories (SVAs) nationwide. All&#13;
43 Central Raion Hospitals nationwide will be equipped with basic instruments to handle complicated&#13;
delivery cases.&#13;
3.21   The Ministry of Health is responsible for the overall management and monitoring of training&#13;
activities. To strengthen MOH management capacity, a computer, printer and software training will be&#13;
provided to the Chief Pediatrician and the Chief Obstetrician. Updates on training will be printed out&#13;
and circulated to health personnel nationwide by the two CCMEs.&#13;
3.22 The subcomponent would require internationally recruited specialists to assist in the design of the&#13;
training programs and of the health promotion materials. Specialties required for technical assistance&#13;
would include: women and children program management; obstetricians and gynecologists with&#13;
experience in having taught the application of the WHO "Mother-Baby" Package Guidelines;&#13;
neonatologist/pediatrician; and venereologist with experience in having taught WHO's Guidelines on&#13;
sexually transmitted diseases. GTZ is committed to funding technical assistance to support health&#13;
promotion activities. Additionally, the Project would finance study tours, consultants on the technical&#13;
specialties listed above, to the extent they are not supported through grants by other donors, as well as&#13;
the translation or design, and reproduction of manuals and booklets on family health for training workers&#13;
and for public information; equipment for training; computers; and clinical equipment for basic mnaternal&#13;
and newborn care to 170 ambulatory centers nationwide. The subcomponent also includes financial&#13;
support for purchasing essential drugs in two annual tranches for 12 central raion hospitals (two per&#13;
oblast) for distribution among surrounding FAPs and ambulatory centers.&#13;
3.23   The MOH has been compiling the essential drugs list and would not later than December 31,&#13;
1997 establish a data base of National Case Management Guidelines for women's reproductive health,&#13;
STDs, ARI/CDD and TB, based on the WHO recommended guidelines, together with treatment protocols&#13;
for all those conditions, indicating that drugs used should be from its Essential Drug List only, and&#13;
thereafter update and distribute these protocols regularly to health workers nationwide.&#13;
Subcomponent A.2 Acute Respiratory Infection and Diarrheal Disease Control&#13;
(US$0.6 million total project cost)&#13;
3.24   The goals of this subcomponent are to reduce deaths of children from acute respiratory tract&#13;
infections and from diarrhea. This will be achieved by retraining hospital-based and outpatient facilities&#13;
pediatricians, infectious disease specialists and pediatric nurses, on management of acute ARI and&#13;
diarrhea cases among children, using redesigned guidelines based on best current knowledge of&#13;
appropriate treatment.&#13;
3.25   The subcomponent would help develop national case management guidelines (or protocols) for&#13;
ARI/CDD case management, following WHO and UNICEF Guidelines and will increase training capacity&#13;
within the country to implement these guidelines. Before negotiatons the Government has concluded that&#13;
no legislation restricts the adoption of the WHO guidelines on ARI/CDD. Not later than December 31,&#13;
1996 MOH will establish national case management guidelines for ARI/CDD case management, as part&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
3.26 This subcomponent would complement the UNICEF ARI/CDD program and would finance&#13;
essential drugs for ARI/CDD to 12 central raion hospitals (two per oblast) to be distributed to&#13;
surrounding FAPs and ambulatory centers. UNICEF would provide essential drugs for the peripheral&#13;
health units. It would train staff in all those facilities and would provide them with a small pack of&#13;
essential drugs and supplies for ARI/CDD, which would subsequently be regularly resupplied from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
central raion hospital. Training would involve "hands-on" practical instruction with patients. Public&#13;
education would be done through lectures and booklets.&#13;
3.27   The system of countrywide training centers and courses, described in paragraph 3.15 above,&#13;
would also train health personnel in the treatment of ARI/CDD. Under the Project, training under the&#13;
ARI/CDD subcomponent will be carried out in two phases: Phase 1. Training of National and Oblast&#13;
Trainers; and Phase 2. Training of Raion trainers. Phase 3. training of primary health care teams would&#13;
be funded by UNICEF. The practical training would consist of case management of acute respiratory&#13;
disease and diarrheal disease.&#13;
Subcomponent A.3:  Tuberculosis Control  (US$1.5 million total project cost)&#13;
3.28   The TB subcomponent of the Primary Health Care component would revitalize the National&#13;
Tuberculosis Program by providing support to the existing three levels: central (at the National&#13;
Tuberculosis and Research Institute), oblast, and raion structures and to the primary health care services&#13;
countrywide for program implementation. Adoption of legislation in the form of a Government decree&#13;
and a law of Parliament, respectively, revitalizing the National Tuberculosis Program and the framework&#13;
for tuberculosis control prepared by the National Tuberculosis Research Institute was a conditon of&#13;
negotiatons which the Government has met. As part of project implementation, new treatment protocols&#13;
for TB will be adopted by December 31, 1996. It will result in more effective case detection and&#13;
treatment, use of current TB treatment protocols, and emphasize ambulatory as opposed to inpatient&#13;
treatment of tuberculosis. In short, it would improve both the clinical effectiveness and economic&#13;
efficiency of the delivery system, and improve the health status of the population through early detection&#13;
and effective treatment of tuberculosis.&#13;
3.29   The TB subcomponent consists of the following elements:&#13;
(a)    expansion, improvement and free provision of tuberculosis diagnostic services in at least&#13;
one facility per raion or city and upgrading of the quality of bacteriological services at&#13;
raion and city level;&#13;
(b)    provision of free short course chemotherapy and other treatment services to all TB cases,&#13;
with directly observed therapy during, at least, the initial phase of chemotherapy, and&#13;
achievement of high cure rates among all sputum smear positive pulmonary cases;&#13;
(c)   improvement of case management by adoption of WHO recommended national case&#13;
management guidelines, recording and reporting system, and adequate supervision;&#13;
(d)    introduction of a system of financial incentives for case detection and cure of tuberculosis&#13;
patients through the Government's own resources including a payment to any health&#13;
worker who originally refers TB suspects for examination if the diagnosis of TB is&#13;
confirmed by sputum smear microscopy, and fees for managing the course of treatment&#13;
if cure is documented (adoption of legislation introducing this system was a condition of&#13;
negotiations and has been fulfilled); and,&#13;
(e)    provision of approximately US$600,000 of TB pharmaceuticals and US$180,000 for the&#13;
transportation and distribution costs of the pharmaceuticals.&#13;
3.30   Training and technical assistance will be crucial for staff at all levels to successfully adopt modern&#13;
supervised, short course chemotherapy and the new policy. In late 1995 two pilot projects in selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
raions began irnplementation to evaluate the operational aspects of the new program. These raions will&#13;
form the national training site for future nationwide project implementation. Basic training equipment&#13;
will be provided for the raions selected for the pilot projects and, later, for the whole country. The&#13;
training centers described in paragraph 3.15 above will be used for the training in the Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Program. The cost of conducting the training programs (central and oblast managers - one&#13;
course every other year; oblast and raion/city staff - seven courses, one per oblast every other year; for&#13;
PHC workers - two brief courses per raion every year; laboratory personnel at central and oblast level -&#13;
one course every other year; peripheral laboratory personnel - one course in each oblast every year), and&#13;
of the materials used will be covered by the Project. The raion coordinator should maintain a close&#13;
relationship with primary health care workers and ensure continuous education on tuberculosis control.&#13;
External consultants to assist and help in the national training courses will be necessary.&#13;
3.31   Two pilot projects have been established to evaluate the feasibility of providing ambulatory&#13;
treatment through the primary health care system, as compared to drug administration through&#13;
hospitalization of all patients at the initial phase of treatment. The results of the pilot projects, as well as&#13;
the progress of implementation of the new primary health care system, will guide the final choice of&#13;
diagnostic and treatment policies for the nationwide project.&#13;
3.32   Since hard-to-justify numbers of facilities and beds dedicated to tuberculosis control are available&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Project will, by its accompanying changes, rationalize the number of beds&#13;
and reduce the number of facilities. As case detection and treatment will become the responsibility of&#13;
primary health care workers, the MOH should consider making current tuberculosis specialists from&#13;
tuberculosis in-patient facilities available, on a part-time basis, to primary health care facilities.&#13;
Component B: Facilities Rehabilitation&#13;
(US$2.3 million total project cost)&#13;
3.33   The facilities rehabilitation component would improve the capacity of the Ministry of Health in&#13;
managing the maintenance of buildings and equipment, and help prepare the MOH to implement&#13;
necessary rationalization programs of the health infrastructure to make it more responsive to the planned&#13;
shift from a predominantly curative system, to a major emphasis on preventive programs and ambulatory&#13;
care. This component would facilitate the transition and the implementation of adjustments in the number&#13;
of hospital beds, remodeling of facilities, and introduction of energy saving measures at health&#13;
institutions. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that during the execution of the Project the&#13;
Borrower will not undertake any new construction of health facilities without prior consultation with the&#13;
Association.&#13;
3.34   The Project will provide US$300,000 for improving conditions of 30 ambulatory centers i.e.&#13;
repairing roofs and floors, replacing ironmongery, refurbishing water and sanitary installations and up-&#13;
grading electrical supply and installations; and US$1,200,000 for converting 30 rural hospitals into&#13;
ambulatory polyclinics with holding beds (carrying out the same repairs as above, and converting existing&#13;
wards into laboratories, consultation rooms, etc.). In addition, US$300,000 for equipment and&#13;
US$150,000 for supplies will be provided to ensure efficient performance of the renovated/converted&#13;
facilities.&#13;
3.35   The Project will also provide US$50,000 (training) and US$7,200 (salary for full-time TCC&#13;
member) to support the activities of the Buildings and Equipment Committee. This Committee, which&#13;
will meet once or twice a month, as necessary, reports to the Minister of Health and represents clinical,&#13;
nursing, technical, staffing administration and financing interests in the Ministry. The Committee's tasks&#13;
include representing the MOH in making decisions regarding building and equipment activities; approving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the technical content of the proposals; and deciding on priorities. The Commnittee will also be responsible&#13;
for obtaining and circulating information within the MOH on civil works projects; coordinating&#13;
commissioning and staffing; delegating tasks within the Ministry and establishing and liaising with user-&#13;
groups at the different facilities being up-graded. In order to assist the Buildings and Equipmnent&#13;
Committee in the above tasks, and further in revising existing norms and standards for health facilities&#13;
and in the implementation of the civil works included in this component, US$60,000 is provided under&#13;
the Project to reimburse the fees of local architectural and engineering consultants.&#13;
3.36   The construction activities of the facilities component will take place initially in the Chui Oblast&#13;
region so as to support closely the provider payment component efforts to rationalize health services and&#13;
facilities before making major investments. The methodologies developed and solutions rendered in Chui&#13;
Oblast will then enable the MOH to apply them nationwide. As a condition of negotiations the MOH&#13;
has prepared a list for review and comments to the Association of 30 ambulatory centers and 30 rural&#13;
hospitals in Chui Oblast and Bishkek City to be repaired and converted as part of this Project. As part&#13;
of project implementation, establishment by MOH of a stakeholder group consisting of health authorities&#13;
and local government officials in each medical facility to be renovated under the Project will take place&#13;
before its renovation in undertaken.&#13;
3.37   The rehabilitation "packages" to be developed will be low cost (US$10,000-40,000 for buildings,&#13;
US$1,000-4,000 for equipment) and may be replicated with national resources in the rest of the country.&#13;
Component C: Medical Care Provider Payment&#13;
(US$4.4 million total project cost)&#13;
3.38   The health care system in the Kyrgyz Republic is dominated by the hospital sector, which&#13;
consumes more than 75 percent of resources. One reason for this inefficient allocation of resources is&#13;
the financial incentives for facilities contained in the current line item budgeting system. The budgeting&#13;
system is based on input measures such as number of beds and staff, and rewards increases in capacity&#13;
rather than the efficient provision of high quality health services.&#13;
3.39   Under the Project the methods to be used by the Ministry of Health through the oblasts to pay&#13;
hospitals, polyclinics, and physicians would be changed to foster efficiency in the health care delivery&#13;
system and promote the use of primary care. Payment for care would no longer be made on the basis&#13;
of production input measures but rather on the basis of performance as measured by coverage of the&#13;
services provided (capitation). The new provider payment methods would strengthen the connection&#13;
between the quantity and quality of services rendered, and the financial reimbursement received for those&#13;
services. Incentives would encourage treatment of patients on an outpatient as opposed to inpatient basis,&#13;
reduce length-of-stay for those patients who do require hospitalization, and reduce unnecessary referrals&#13;
to specialists and for diagnostic tests.&#13;
3.40   Provider payment reforms would change the financing and the organization of care in two&#13;
important ways. Payment for care would be separated from delivery of care. The payer would focus&#13;
on paying for the best care at the lowest cost -- purchasing care rather than manage and maintain&#13;
facilities. The provider would be made responsible for managing the services and would have more&#13;
flexibility to focus on delivering the most optimal mix of services with the best outcome. Secondly,&#13;
providers would be "at risk" in that they would now be responsible for any deficits between payments&#13;
received and costs incurred. Providers would be accountable for more efficient and higher quality of&#13;
care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.41   The Project would extend to two other jurisdictions the provider payment aspect of a USAID-&#13;
funded pilot program, which is now in the early stages of implementation in Issyk-kul Oblast. The&#13;
Technical Coordinating Committee (TCC) would monitor the progress of Issyk-kul and the extended pilot,&#13;
and keep Government officials and providers informed about the design, implementation and results of&#13;
the pilot.&#13;
3.42   Site Selection: The geographic areas selected as most favorable for extending the demonstration&#13;
are Bishkek City and Chui Oblast. These sites are preferable for several reasons: (i) relatively dense,&#13;
urban population; (ii) most affluent geo-political units (in terms of per capita income and tax revenues&#13;
paid); (iii) relative sophistication of medical institutions and trained personnel; (iv) relative excess of&#13;
medical providers, especially physicians per capita in Bishkek; (v) contiguous geographically, effectively&#13;
sharing market areas for medical services; (vi) proximity to health sector leadership for observation and&#13;
evaluation; and, (vii) proximity to technical coordinating staff for implementation purposes under the&#13;
Credit. Selected data comparing features of these two geographic units and Issyk-kul to national averages&#13;
are provided in Annex 4, Table 2.&#13;
3.43   Pilot Design. Implementation of this component requires structural change in the health services&#13;
delivery system as well as development of new provider payment systems and the corresponding financial&#13;
infrastructure to support them. Four major progranmmatic elements or modules of the medical care&#13;
provider payments component are described below:&#13;
3.44   (i) The first element is comprehensive restructuring of the primary care sector through the&#13;
establishment of new primary care group practices--Family Group Practices. In order to reimburse&#13;
providers a capitated rate for the provision of all primary health services to an individual, an entity&#13;
capable of providing the entire range of primary health services must exist and consist of a therapist&#13;
(internist), pediatrician, and obstetrician/gynecologist. Currently there are very few general practitioners.&#13;
3.45   The primary care groups would be the focal point of the new provider payment methods: they&#13;
would enroll people and receive a capitated rate for providing a specified set of health services. The&#13;
financial incentive for the groups is to provide services rather than referring patients to other parts of the&#13;
health delivery system. Different models of primary care should be encouraged, and over time clinical&#13;
retraining and new medical institute curriculum will lead to the development of general and family&#13;
practitioners. The primary care groups should be independent, form voluntarily, and be organized as a&#13;
business. They can initiate the development of non-profit entities within the health sector and also&#13;
become private practitioners.&#13;
3.46   Approximately 300 primary care group practices would be formed to serve the population of&#13;
Bishkek City and Chui Oblast, estimated at 1.6 million people. Each group would be capable of enrolling&#13;
and serving approximately 5,300 people. About 150 groups would come on line in the first year of the&#13;
Project, 100 in the second year and 50 in the third year. A significant portion of the provider payment&#13;
component budget will be directed at developing the capacity of these entities to respond to the financial&#13;
incentives of the new payment methods. The Project will fund minor renovations of new practice&#13;
locations, allowing them to establish a separate identity and be dispersed throughout the community;&#13;
equipment to enable the groups to treat patients rather than refer them; clinical training to increase clinical&#13;
capability and begin development of a cadre of general practitioners; and, establishment of financial&#13;
systems, including development of practice managers providing business skills for the groups.&#13;
3.47   (ii) The second element is free choice of primary care provider by the population and enrollment&#13;
of the entire population into primary care groups. Participation by the population in decisions about their&#13;
health care gives providers an incentive to provide high quality services. If patients are not satisfied, they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
can change providers. Information would be furnished to the population to help them make informed&#13;
choices about their medical provider. The Project would fund a public awareness and marketing&#13;
campaign, an enrollment process, and the distribution of comparative information so the population may&#13;
judge provider performance.&#13;
3.48   (iii) The third element is new incentive-based provider payment systems for primary care services,&#13;
outpatient specialty and ancillary services, and hospital services. These payment systems replace line-&#13;
item budgets for facilities with payment for health services at the patient level. Although the experience&#13;
of the Issyk-kul pilot will determine the exact form of these systems, the main concepts are a capitated&#13;
rate and a case-based hospital payment. A capitated rate is the payment of a set fee to a provider for the&#13;
provision of certain health services to an individual. A case-base hospital payment system reimburses&#13;
hospitals a prospectively set fee depending on the type and severity of the treated case.&#13;
3.49   Currently, national, oblast, municipal, and raion governments finance and control their own&#13;
facilities using a budgetary system which allocates funds through predetermined functional categories such&#13;
as salaries and medical supplies. The health reforms envision the population choosing providers and&#13;
providers receiving payment for specific services rendered to patients. The focus of payment for health&#13;
services changes from the facility level to the patient level. A fiscal intermediary is needed to pool the&#13;
funds from the national, oblast, municipal, and raion sources and reimburse providers for health services&#13;
they provide to the population. Funds would no longer be delineated by government level and separately&#13;
allocated to facilities; services would be purchased by the fiscal intermediary from one pool of funds.&#13;
3.50   The fiscal intermediary requires institutional capacity to pool the funds and manage the new&#13;
provider payment systems. The development and installation of new computer systems is especially&#13;
important. Provider payment on a treated case basis increases the base unit for reimbursement many&#13;
times. For example, in Issyk-kul the base unit for hospital payment will increase from budgets for about&#13;
50 facilities to payment for about 50,000 treated hospital cases. This very large increase in the number&#13;
of transactions requires the development of automated systems to manage the payment process.&#13;
3.51   Computer systems would handle enrollment of the population, construction of rates for the&#13;
payment systems, recording of clinical information from facility bills, payment of providers for services,&#13;
operation of a quality assurance system, and analysis of health statistics. An accounting system would&#13;
record all financial transactions from defined source payment documents, interact with the banking system&#13;
and provide financial reports for the fiscal intermediary. Current accounting systems provide a good&#13;
starting point; however, they could benefit from the introduction of accrual accounting and more&#13;
sophisticated financial reporting to present available information in a more useful form. Internal auditing&#13;
and control procedures are necessary. Relationships between the fiscal intermediary and the treasury and&#13;
banking system need to be clearly defined. The transition to a stable market economy may require the&#13;
banking system to gradually shift its focus toward handling financial transactions efficiently, away from&#13;
serving as a control mechanism.&#13;
3.52   The Issyk-kul pilot is developing and implementing these new systems. This allows for efficient&#13;
refinement and extension of the products under the proposed project's provider payment component. The&#13;
Project will fund adaptation of the new provider payment systems to Bishkek and Chui Oblast,&#13;
procurement of computer hardware, refinement and installation of computer and accounting systems for&#13;
the fiscal intermediary to track data of enrolled patients, and training of local experts and facility&#13;
managers to implement the new provider payment systems.&#13;
3.53   (iv) The fourth element is development of health sector infrastructure to support the&#13;
implementation of new provider payment systens.  This infrastructure consists of three areas: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
integrated management information systems (MIS), such as cost accounting and clinical information&#13;
systems, to track data on the country's health care delivery, resource use and utilization patterns and&#13;
provide managers tools to improve their decision-making ability; (b) increased management autonomy,&#13;
flexibility, and accountability for health care providers; and, (c) quality assurance systems to monitor care&#13;
and prevent "gaming" or abuse under different financial incentives of new provider payment systems.&#13;
3.54   As with the Project's provider payment systems, these infrastructure products are being developed&#13;
in Issyk-kul. The provider payment component will fund adaptation of the systems, procurement of&#13;
computer hardware and software to establish the capacity necessary at the facility level, and training of&#13;
local experts and facility managers.&#13;
3.55   Finance and Training Plan: The medical care provider payment component requires US$4.4&#13;
million in IDA and counterpart funds to implement over a four and a half year period. The Government&#13;
of the Kyrgyz Republic would be required to provide contributions in terms of staff time and expertise.&#13;
A limited number of leaders would be offered the opportunity for out-of-country study tours and training.&#13;
These trips would be planned in the first year of the Project to support the initial development and&#13;
implementation of the provider payment systems, and the third year of the Project to support the&#13;
continued refinement of the provider payment systems following initial implementation.&#13;
3.56   Approximately 2,000 health care personnel would receive training under the Project's medical&#13;
care provider payment component. Most of this training would occur in years I and 2 of the Project.&#13;
The training would be preparatory to the implementation of new provider payment systems, which would&#13;
begin in year 2 and be phased-in over years 2-4. Retraining of physicians would occur over the first&#13;
three years to coincide with the establishment of primary care groups. Internists, pediatricians, and&#13;
obstetricians/gynecologists would receive both classroom and on-site training to improve their capability&#13;
to manage care on an outpatient basis and begin the conversion to general and family practitioners. This&#13;
process would be enhanced by changes in the curriculum for medical students. Training for specialists&#13;
would be offered as they begin to redefine their role in the new health care delivery system.&#13;
3.57   A clinical training center would be established and provided with equipment and materials at the&#13;
Republican Center of Continuous Medical Education to provide clinical training to physicians. The&#13;
Health Finance and Management Department of the CCME would also be established as a training center&#13;
and provided equipment and materials to hold training for the provider payments component. In addition&#13;
to more efficient provision of training, improving the education capacity will build the finance and&#13;
management skills needed within the health sector to sustain the reforms.&#13;
3.58   Implementation: The institution of new provider payment methods requires substantial technical&#13;
expertise in hospital payment, physician payment, clinical practice, cost accounting, clinical information&#13;
systems, management, finance and internal auditing, computer systems, accreditation, and quality&#13;
improvement. Although most of the products would have been developed in the Issyk-kul pilot, they will&#13;
need to be adjusted to fit Bishkek and Chui Oblast because the population composition is different.&#13;
3.59   The implementation strategy of this component is to use foreign experts selectively to produce&#13;
defined products. Each of the four program elements would have a foreign expert or module leader.&#13;
Module leaders would have three goals in their work: (i) refine the Issyk-kul products to fit Bishkek and&#13;
Chui; (ii) provide initial training to a broad audience on the systems/products through workshops, and&#13;
intensively train a local expert in the specialty area; and, (iii) work with the local expert to implement&#13;
this aspect of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
3.60   The local expert for each programmatic area would be responsible for implementation of the&#13;
product and continued training of health personnel. Qualified computer specialists would support them.&#13;
They would both work for the fiscal intermediary or one of three associations formed to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of the provider payment reforms. The three associations are a Primary Care Physicians&#13;
Association, a Hospital Association, and an Accreditation Commission.  Establishing these three&#13;
organizations should contribute to the sustainability of the reforms. The Accreditation Commission needs&#13;
to be independent, to determine objectively whether a facility meets the minimum standards required to&#13;
operate and receive payment for services. In the medium to long-term, the Primary Care Physicians&#13;
Association and Hospital Association will serve as representative bodies in a more decentralized, market-&#13;
oriented health sector. While the local experts serving as their employees are initially supported by the&#13;
Project, they are developing marketable skills which will be in demand in the future.&#13;
3.61   The central Ministry of Health would have overall responsibility for the component with&#13;
implementation managed by the TCC. The TCC would have one full-time advisor to coordinate all&#13;
provider payment activities. Close coordination is required with several other critical organizational&#13;
components -- the central Ministry of Finance and the oblast (city in the case of Bishkek) level&#13;
administration, Department of Health, and Department of Finance. To facilitate collaboration between&#13;
the central, oblast and city level governments, Ministry/Department of Health, and Ministry/Department&#13;
of Finance, a task force would be formed with representatives of the various stakeholders. The World&#13;
Bank, TCC, and task force would continue its close collaboration with other relevant donors -- notably&#13;
USAID, ODA and GTZ.&#13;
3.62   For full implementation of the pilot to occur, the Government must ensure that all legal and&#13;
regulatory obstacles are removed. Before negotiations the Government has concluded that current&#13;
legislation does not restrict implementation of new provider payment systems in the extended pilot.&#13;
However, an order specifically allowing such payment systems is being prepared and will be adopted by&#13;
December 31, 1996 as part of project implementation. The order will address at least the following three&#13;
points:&#13;
(a)    Savings from rationalization of facilities or implementation of new provider payment&#13;
methods will be retained and reinvested in the medical sector;&#13;
(b)    Establishment of a mechanism to enforce the pooling of funds at the national, oblast,&#13;
municipal and raion level; and&#13;
(c)    Authority to establish new payment methods including at least the following:&#13;
(i)    The line-item budget system will not be used to reimburse providers.&#13;
(ii)    Determination and resolution of conflicts with the Treasury System created by&#13;
new provider payment methods.&#13;
(iii)   Capability to institute performance-based pay.&#13;
(iv)   Facility management autonomy including hiring and firing.&#13;
3.63   A smooth transition of the provider payment reforms from the Issyk-kul pilot to Bishkek City and&#13;
Chui Oblast requires continuous coordination with the Issyk-kul pilot over the next year. The TCC and&#13;
task force should meet regularly with the Issyk-kul pilot team, begin work on designing the program and&#13;
adapting the Issyk-kul products, communicate with and educate officials about the design, implementation&#13;
and results of the Issyk-kul pilot, and monitor the progress of the pilot program. The three parties should&#13;
continue to work to facilitate the rapid implementation of the extended pilot by identifying,&#13;
communicating and helping to resolve any issues which arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
3.64   During negotiations, assurances related to the implementation of this component, were obtained&#13;
that the Government would evaluate the Issyk-kul provider payments pilot program, not later than&#13;
December 31, 1996 to explore the feasibility of introducing a provider payment mechanism for health&#13;
care workers, and present the results of the evaluation to the Association for its review and comments&#13;
and would subsequently apply the recommendations to the implementation of the medical care provider&#13;
payments component of the Project. As part of project implementation, the Borrower would take the&#13;
following steps:&#13;
(a)    not later than December 31, 1996, issue guidelines, acceptable to the Association, to&#13;
health authorities at all levels on leasing of publicly owned health premises to family&#13;
group practices.&#13;
(b)    MOH would, not later than December 31, 1996, carry out a study of the levels of patient&#13;
referrals from primary care physicians to specialists and for diagnostic tests in Bishkek&#13;
City and Chui Oblast; not later than June 30, 1997, MOH would submit this study to the&#13;
Association for review and comments, and subsequently MOH would implement the&#13;
agreed recommendations.&#13;
(c)    not later than December 31, 1997, (i) establish and thereafter maintain a Health Fund into&#13;
which national, oblast, municipal, and raion level health and finance authorities would&#13;
contribute and out of which medical providers will be paid, together with guidelines on&#13;
the manner and level of contribution by these health authorities and the characteristics and&#13;
costs of services to be purchased; (ii) design and implement a national health accounts&#13;
system to be able to track the allocation of resources for health and the flow of funds in&#13;
the health sector; and (iii) pass legislation allowing establishment of primary health care&#13;
provider groups as non-profit entities and opening of bank accounts by such groups.&#13;
Component D: Pharmaceutical Management&#13;
(US$8.3 million total project cost)&#13;
3.65   The pharmaceutical management component is aimed at improving the availability of essential&#13;
drugs both (a) directly, by financing the procurement and distribution of a large quantity of essential&#13;
drugs, and (b) indirectly, by supporting the implementation of far-reaching reforms designed to strengthen&#13;
the Government's drug regulatory capabilities and to increase the discipline and cost-effectiveness of&#13;
public spending. Financial support for the procurement and distribution of essential drugs is contingent&#13;
on the Government's continued determination to implement these reforms.&#13;
3.66   The pharmaceutical management component will support the following activities:&#13;
(a)    renovation of the premises of the national drug regulatory organization and acquisition&#13;
of office equipment and furniture, laboratory testing equipment and furniture, reagents&#13;
and chemical glassware, scientific literature, and other goods needed in order for the&#13;
organization to function effectively;&#13;
(b)   technical assistance and training for the staff of the drug regulatory organization, as well&#13;
as broad dissemination to other health care officials of information on drug regulatory&#13;
affairs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
(c)    development, production, printing, and widespread distribution of the Kyrgyz Republic's&#13;
Essential Drugs List, as well as training health care officials and managers concerning&#13;
the goals and rationale of an Essential Drugs Program;&#13;
(d)    development of new standard medical treatment guidelines, based on and consistent with&#13;
the Essential Drugs List; and,&#13;
(e)    procurement and distribution of a significant quantity of essential drugs.&#13;
National Drug Regulatory Organization&#13;
3.67   The national drug regulatory authority will be responsible for: (a) the registration of all drugs and&#13;
vaccines manufactured and/or marketed in the Kyrgyz Republic, including pre-registration review of all&#13;
technical information on safety and effectiveness, the organization of clinical trials if necessary, and post-&#13;
registration monitoring of drug utilization and possible adverse drug reactions; and, (b) quality testing&#13;
and quality assurance of all drugs and vaccines manufactures, imported, marketed, and/or otherwise&#13;
distributed in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
3.68   A national drug regulatory organization was established in 1993 by decree of the Prime Minister.&#13;
Located within the MOH, the organization is known officially as the Administration for Standardization&#13;
and Oversight of the Quality of Medicines and Medical Technology. The authority and responsibilities&#13;
of this organization are reaffirmed in a proposed "Law on Medicines" that has been drafted and its&#13;
adoption by the Borrower is a condition of effectiveness. The Administration for Standardization&#13;
includes, among its subordinate departments, a national drug testing laboratory which is responsible for&#13;
(a) providing technical support of the Administration's registration decisions, and (b) ascertaining the&#13;
quality of drugs manufactures, imported, and/or otherwise distributed in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
3.69   The Drug Regulatory Organization and its subordinate testing laboratory, which are co-located,&#13;
have rented 340 meters of space at the Institute of Cardiology and are negotiating with the Institute to&#13;
rent an additional 160 meters of adjoining space. With a total of approximately 500 square meters of&#13;
space, the organization will have sufficient room to perform its functions. Renovation of the premises&#13;
has begun, and a small amount of testing equipment has been procured; it will be installed when&#13;
additional renovation is completed and the necessary laboratory furniture has been acquired. Current staff&#13;
of the organization numbers 15 of a planned 35. The Project will provide extensive support to enable&#13;
the organization and laboratory to become fully operational as quickly as possible. The Project will&#13;
provide US$97,000 for renovation of the premises and US$357,000 for the purchase of: office furniture&#13;
and equipment; laboratory testing equipment and furniture; reagents and chemical glassware; scientific&#13;
literature, computer software, and databases; and other necessary supplies.&#13;
3.70   The Project will finance a substantial amount of training for the staff of the organization and&#13;
laboratory, including activities designed to foster close professional relations between officials of the&#13;
organization and counterparts in drug regulatory agencies of other countries. The Project will finance&#13;
in-country training in the use of computers and databases, the use of new laboratory equipment, and cost-&#13;
effectiveness analysis for approximately 75 people during the first two years of the Project. The Project&#13;
also will finance approximately 50 person-weeks of training and study tours abroad, spread over four&#13;
years. In order to facilitate widespread dissemination of this information within the Kyrgyz Republic and&#13;
to support a limited amount of training for persons outside the organization and laboratory, e.g. local&#13;
health care officials, the Project will also finance an annual two-day national conference on drug&#13;
regulatory affairs, including participation of foreign experts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
3.71   The Drug Regulatory Organization presently operates as a self-financing body, relying on income&#13;
from registration and testing fees. As a result, drug regulatory officials may have a direct economic&#13;
interest in their regulatory decisions, and this may increase the risk that ineffective, or even unsafe, drugs&#13;
will be made available to patients. In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, the compensation of&#13;
senior drug officials and other staff with a direct voice in regulatory decisions should be financed directly&#13;
from the state budget. Before negotiations the Government did adopt revised procedures for financing&#13;
the Administration for Standardization, providing that the salaries of senior officials and regulatory&#13;
decision-makers are financed by the Government and not from fees.&#13;
3.72   The TCC  Component Coordinator for pharmaceutical management will supervise the&#13;
implementation of the various activities. In cooperation with the Chief of the Drug Regulatory&#13;
Organization, other MOH officials, and the Project Coordination Unit, the TCC component coordinator&#13;
will prepare terms-of-reference for all procurement contracts, including adequately specified lists of&#13;
equipment, furniture, supplies, and other goods to be purchased with project funds. The TCC component&#13;
coordinator will prepare, in concert with the Chief of the Drug Regulatory Organization, an annual&#13;
training plan, including the dates, location, purpose, and names of participants for all in-country training&#13;
courses and foreign study tours; the TCC component coordinator will exercise personal responsibility for&#13;
assuring that all technical and logistical requirements of the training are met. The TCC component&#13;
coordinator will maintain continual communications with other donors, in particular WHO, in order to&#13;
minimize duplication and to maximize coordination in all drug regulatory technical assistance and training&#13;
activities. Finally, the Coordinator will, each year, convene and chair a temporary organizing committee&#13;
to prepare for and to implement the annual national conference on drug regulatory affairs.&#13;
Essential Drugs Program&#13;
3.73   An Essential Drugs List (EDL), numbering 300 different products, has been adopted as a first&#13;
step toward the creation of an Essential Drugs Program (EDP). Part 1 of this list consists of the 195&#13;
"most widely distributed basic medicines" that are expected to be consistently available at, or by&#13;
prescription from, all primary and secondary health care facilities. Part 2 consists of 105 "basic&#13;
medicines used in specialized institutions."  The EDL has been endorsed by both WHO and the&#13;
Association. Before negotiations, the Government did adopt and publish the EDL, agreed upon by the&#13;
Association and WHO.&#13;
3.74   The EDL was compiled by a large ad hoc committee in the MOH and is the product of a lengthy&#13;
dialogue between the MOH and experts from the WHO and the Association. The process for establishing&#13;
and maintaining the EDL must now be institutionalized. The latest draft of the "Law on Medicines"&#13;
delegates to the MOH formal authority to compile the EDL. Final passage of this law, with this authority&#13;
included, and the adoption of formal rules and procedures for compiling and maintaining the EDL,&#13;
including provisions for its periodic review and, if necessary, revision in the future in a form acceptable&#13;
to the Association, is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.75   In order to become an effective means of influence over the procurement and utilization of drugs,&#13;
the EDL must be made widely available, and the rationale for an EDL must be understood clearly and&#13;
supported by physicians, pharmacists, other health care professionals, and health care financing decision-&#13;
makers. The Project will support development and publication of a brochure, containing the EDL and&#13;
a lengthy commentary explaining how the EDL was compiled and its purpose. The Project will finance&#13;
the printing and distribution of several thousand copies of the brochure, which will be made available to&#13;
all pharmacists and health facilities prior to the start of the sizable procurement of essential drugs under&#13;
the Project. The Project will help to finance a workshop in each oblast prior to effectiveness, in order&#13;
to introduce the EDL to local health leaders and to build professional support for an Essential Drugs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Program. In the second and fourth years of the Project, revised editions of the EDL will be published&#13;
and distributed.&#13;
3.76   Equally necessary for effective implementation of the EDL is the development and dissemination&#13;
of new, standard medical treatment guidelines that are compatible and consistent with the limited range&#13;
of drugs included on the List. The MOH already has begun to draft new treatment guidelines, and the&#13;
Project will support a study tour prior to effectiveness, designed to further this effort.&#13;
3.77   Maximum benefit of the EDL will be achieved when the List becomes a principal mechanism for&#13;
regulating public spending on drugs. However, a requirement that public spending for drugs be limited&#13;
to the EDL is, for the time being, impracticable. Two years will be needed in order to train health care&#13;
professionals and to win their support and cooperation, but also in order to gain experience with the List&#13;
and to revise the List in light of this experience, as will inevitably be required. From the start of the&#13;
third year of the Project, public spending on drugs will be limited to the EDL: from that date, state-&#13;
owned health facilities will be permitted to buy, and specially "entitled" ambulatory patients will be&#13;
permitted to receive free of charge or at subsidized prices, only drugs included on its EDL. As part of&#13;
project implementation, the Government would from January 31, 1998 onwards allocate budget resources&#13;
for procurement and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals solely to pharmaceuticals listed on its EDL and&#13;
registered in the country. At the same time, no restrictions will be placed on the privately-financed&#13;
purchase, distribution, and sale of medicines which are not included on the EDL.&#13;
3.78   The establishment and operations of the Kyrgyz Republic's Essential Drugs Program will be&#13;
undertaken and supervised by a standing commission or committee appointed by the Minister of Health,&#13;
consistent with authority provided by the proposed "Law on Medicines" and as provided by the rules to&#13;
be adopted on compiling and maintaining its EDL. As part of project implementation, the Government&#13;
would establish this standing committee by December 31, 1996. The TCC Component Coordinator for&#13;
pharmaceutical management will be a member of this body and will coordinate the various project&#13;
activities intended to support implementation of the EDP. In particular, the TCC component coordinator&#13;
will: (a) convene and chair a small, informal working group to oversee production and distribution of the&#13;
EDL; (b) maintain close communications with WHO, UNICEF, and other donors in order to ensure that&#13;
foreign assistance in the development of new standard treatment guidelines is used with minimum&#13;
duplication and maximum effectiveness; and (c) convene and chair an informal working group to design&#13;
and implement a monitoring program which will include regular surveys of pharmacies and physicians&#13;
in order to measure the availability and utilization of essential drugs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Procurement of Essential Drugs&#13;
3.79   In order (a) to improve significantly the supply of the most important and commonly used&#13;
essential drugs, and thereby to facilitate introduction of the Essential Drugs Program, and (b) to&#13;
strengthen financially key elements of the Kyrgyz Republic's drug distribution system now undergoing&#13;
privatization, funds amounting to US$6.0 million (without contingencies) over the life of the project&#13;
would finance the purchase and distribution of drugs included on the EDL. All drugs purchased with&#13;
project funds will be selected from Part 1 of the EDL and procured by the Project Coordinating Unit&#13;
(PCU). In principle, registration of drugs must be completed or in progress prior to award of contracts,&#13;
although the Borrower and the Association may agree on certain exceptions to this requirement. They&#13;
must be labeled in Russian; and all bulk packages and individual vials and containers must be identified&#13;
as containing an "Essential Drug of the Kyrgyz Republic." In order to give potential vendors sufficient&#13;
time to register their drugs, a list of drugs to be procured was published in the March 31, 1996&#13;
Development Business; final procurement will be limited to drugs included on the initial list. A similar&#13;
procedure will be observed in the case of subsequent tranches, although the minimum period between&#13;
publication of the initial procurement list and bidding will be four months.&#13;
3.80   In order to minimize supply shocks, funds will be disbursed in four annual tranches of&#13;
approximately US$2.0 million in each of the first two years and approximately US$1.0 million each in&#13;
Project Years Three and Four. Initially, onward distribution of the drugs procured with these funds will&#13;
be organized as follows. Procurements will be divided into six lots, according to a formula approved&#13;
by the Association prior to effectiveness; winning vendors will deliver shipments, in accordance with this&#13;
formula, to Naryn Oblast Pharmacia, Issyk-kul Oblast Pharmacia, Osh Oblast Pharmacia, Talas Oblast&#13;
Pharmacia, Dzhalal-Abad Oblast Pharmacia, and Kyrgyz Pharmacia (for onward distribution in Chui&#13;
Oblast and Bishkek city)--hereafter, these recipients are called the "Distributors"; bidders' prices will&#13;
include the cost of transportation and delivery to these destinations. Drugs will be sold to the Distributors&#13;
on credit, based on an arrangement to be described in distribution agreements. Preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for the first annual tranche of drug procurement, and distribution agreements for these drugs&#13;
in six oblasts, in a form acceptable to the Association is a condition of effectiveness. The Distributors&#13;
will be permitted to sell drugs procured with project funds at prices no higher than the nominal cost of&#13;
procurement and delivery plus a five percent markup (equal approximately to the cost of handling and&#13;
distribution). The requirement that the drugs be sold at controlled prices will limit the risk of diversion,&#13;
while maximizing availability. All prospective buyers, regardless of their form of organization or&#13;
ownership, will be guaranteed equal opportunities to purchase the drugs. Revenues received by the&#13;
Distributors, generated by the sale of drugs procured with project funds, will be accounted separately and&#13;
used (a) to cancel the distributors' substantial debt and (b) to rebuild the distributors' working capital.&#13;
The Government will present to the Association as part of the bidding documents to be submitted prior&#13;
to effectiveness, the contract for drug distribution, and a list with the percentages of revenue allocated&#13;
to these purposes, along with remaining revenue allocated to tax payments. In turn, the hospitals,&#13;
pharmacies, and distributors that buy Project-financed drugs from the oblast Pharmacias and Kyrgyz&#13;
Pharmacia will be permitted to sell the drugs to patients at unrestricted prices, except in the case of&#13;
legally exempted patients, and the revenues resulting from such sales will be taxed according to existing&#13;
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. As part of project implementation, drug procurement and distribution&#13;
will be reviewed by the Government by June 30, 1997 and thereafter at the end of each procurement&#13;
cycle so as to assure that privately owned drug wholesalers and retailers are not disadvantaged, compared&#13;
to remaining state-owned companies.&#13;
3.81   In addition to the US$6.0 million to be used to finance the procurement and distribution of drugs&#13;
from Part 1 of the Essential Drugs Lists, US$2.0 million will be made available to purchase necessary&#13;
drugs in support of the activities in the Primary Health Care component of the Project. In order to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness, these PHC drugs will be procured by the PCU at the samne&#13;
time as, and in accordance with the same procedures used for, the procurement of essential drugs.&#13;
However, the PHC drugs will be onward distributed as specified previously in the description of the PHC&#13;
component of the Project.&#13;
National Drug Policy&#13;
3.82   The Kyrgyz Republic has not yet published a document, or set of documents, sufficiently broad&#13;
and encompassing as to constitute a national drug policy. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been&#13;
made in developing the individual components required of such a policy, notably the Law on Medicines.&#13;
A national Drug Regulatory Authority and associated testing laboratory have been established and are&#13;
being put into operation. Initial steps to establish an Essential Drugs Program have been taken. The&#13;
former vertically-integrated and highly centralized state monopoly in charge of drug procurement and&#13;
distribution is being thoroughly restructured and privatized. In addition, in collaboration with the&#13;
MANAS project, the MOH has drafted a lengthy, comprehensive "Master Plan" for future development&#13;
of the Republic's health care system, which includes a detailed discussion of national policy and&#13;
development priorities in the pharmaceutical sector. Taken together, these individual activities constitute&#13;
the core elements of a comprehensive national drug policy which, if articulated publicly, would raise the&#13;
effectiveness of the pharmaceutical management component of the Project and contribute positively to the&#13;
overall development of the Republic's pharmaceutical sector. The Government's policy statement as&#13;
described in para. 1.50 reaffirms its commitment.&#13;

PART IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
4.1    The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$20.1 million equivalent. The estimated cost and&#13;
foreign exchange by components are shown in Table 4.1 below. Detailed cost estimates by type of&#13;
expenditure are contained in Annex 12.&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
4.2    Project costs have been estimated in US dollars because of the difficulty in forecasting inflation&#13;
rates for local currency. Civil works cost have been derived from a detailed study carried out in August&#13;
1995 during preparation of the Project. Costs for Goods consisting of pharmaceuticals, medical&#13;
equipment and related supplies, other miscellaneous office equipment consisting of computer and related&#13;
equipment and software are based on recent contracts awarded under an on-going IDA-financed project&#13;
(Social Safety Net Project-Credit No. 2643-KG). Unit costs for medical equipment and related supplies&#13;
are based on UNICEF price lists and quotations from suppliers in Bank-financed projects in other FSU&#13;
countries. Cost for consulting services have been derived on the basis of recent cost estimates for&#13;
comparable services in other IDA-financed projects in the Kyrgyz Republic including training (both local&#13;
and overseas). The costs of consulting services would include, fees, recruitment/relocation costs,&#13;
housing, subsistence, and overheads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
4.3    The foreign exchange component has been estimated as follows: (a) civil works - 0%; (b) goods&#13;
consisting of pharnaceuticals, medical and other equipment and related supplies - 100%; (c) consultants&#13;
and overseas training (study tours and fellowships) - 100%; (d) local consultants - 0%; (e) local training-&#13;
0%; and (f) project administration - 66%). These percentages have been determined assuming that&#13;
basically all goods (pharmaceuticals, equipment and related supplies) would be imported, and that&#13;
international consultants would be recruited internationally.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
4.4   Price contingencies, representing about 4% of the total project cost, are based on estimated&#13;
inflation rates of 2.0% for 1996, 1.6% for 1997, 2.1% for 1998, 2.4% for 1999, and 2.2% for 2000.&#13;
It is assumed that the rate of exchange will depreciate in step with local inflation. Price contingencies&#13;
on local costs (expressed in US dollars) are therefore based on the same international inflation rates.&#13;
Physical contingencies represent about 8% of the total project cost.&#13;
Taxes and Duties&#13;
4.5    Civil work contracts would be subject to all applicable local taxes which is estimated at 10% of&#13;
the total civil works cost. All Goods (pharmaceuticals, equipment and related supplies) specifically&#13;
imported for the Project would be exempt from custom duties and taxes. International and local&#13;
consultants would be exempt from the Government's normal personal income tax. At negotiations, the&#13;
Government confirmed that tax and duty free status would be granted.&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
4.6    The total project cost is estimated at US$20.1 million (including taxes of US$0.2 million), with&#13;
a foreign exchange component of US$14.7 million. The financing plan is shown in Table 4.2 below.&#13;
The proposed Credit of US$18.5 million would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and&#13;
about 70 percent of local costs including taxes. The proposed Credit of US$18.5 million would finance&#13;
about 92 % of total project costs and the Government would contribute US$1.6 million equivalent or about&#13;
8% of total project costs.&#13;

Recurrent Costs&#13;
4.7    Recurrent Costs (US$1.0 million) will be comprised of salaries, utilities, Government in-country&#13;
travel and per diem, maintenance and operation of equipment, rents, and operating costs.  The&#13;
Government will finance 100% of recurrent costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Incremental Recurrent Costs&#13;
4.8   Several aspects of the Project are based on the rationale that there is a need for current health&#13;
sector expenditures to be maintained at least at the 1994 ratio to GDP of 3.6 percent. Significant gains&#13;
in efficiency are expected from the introduction of provider payments for services, and the liberalization&#13;
of budgetary expenditure rigidities. Greater reliance on fee for service will increase the level of private&#13;
spending for health which at the moment is quite low. The Project would require the Government to&#13;
provide incentive payments for the TB workers (US$82,000), and an estimated 10 percent contribution&#13;
to the civil works to cover local taxes (US$196,480). The total Government contribution is estimated&#13;
at US$1,605,127. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Borrower would deposit its&#13;
counterpart funds for the Project quarterly and in advance in the project account, establishment of which&#13;
in a commercial bank is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
Summary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
4.9    The Project Coordination Unit would be responsible for managing procurement under the&#13;
proposed project. Specialized Procurement Consultants would assist the PCU in development of technical&#13;
specifications. Procurement of goods and services would be in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and "Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated&#13;
August 1981. Standard Bidding Documents (Goods) and Form of Contracts (Services) issued by the Bank&#13;
would be used as appropriate for the Goods and Services to be procured. Both works and goods would&#13;
be grouped in the most efficient manner possible and the proposed packaging would be reviewed by the&#13;
Association.  Table 4.3 below summarizes the proposed procurement arrangements.  Detailed&#13;
procurement arrangements indicating the number of procurement packages, their value and method is&#13;
presented in Annex 10 and described below.&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
4.10   Civil Works (US$2.0 million). Civil works for the Facilities Rehabilitation and Pharmaceutical&#13;
Management Components consisting of modest rehabilitation and upgrading of 60 primary health care&#13;
facilities (US$1.74 million) and laboratory renovation (US$96,000). The Government will provide&#13;
approximately US$200,000 for any local taxes in civil works contracts. Due to the (i) small contract&#13;
values, (US$10,000 to US$50,000 per contract); (ii) works that are geographically scattered and spread&#13;
over time due in part by climatic conditions; and (iii) labor intensive techniques, procurement of small&#13;
scale civil works will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. Each&#13;
year, the PCU will advertise to solicit expressions of interest from contractors in carrying out the civil&#13;
works to be financed under the project. The Borrower shall use bidding documents developed in the&#13;
ECA region.  The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, and relevant drawings where applicable. Short letters of&#13;
invitation and a brief standard form of contract have been reviewed and accepted by the Association. The&#13;
award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and&#13;
who has the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract. Contracts above US$50,000&#13;
will be awarded on the basis on NCB procedures and for this purpose, the Borrower will use the Bank's&#13;
sample NCB document dated September 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Procurement of Goods (except pharmaceuticals)&#13;
4.11   Goods (US$3.8 million) consisting of medical and other equipment and related supplies, would&#13;
be grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive bidding. The following methods of&#13;
procurement would be followed:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for goods estimated&#13;
to cost US$1.8 million related to contracts estimated to cost more than US$300,000&#13;
equivalent each;&#13;
(b)   International Shopping procedures (IS) would be used for the procurement of goods that&#13;
cannot be grouped in packages above US$300,000. Quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers from at least two different eligible countries would be required for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$300,000 and more than US$50,000. An aggregate limit&#13;
of US$1.8 million worth of goods excluding pharmaceuticals would be procured through&#13;
IS; and,&#13;
(c)    National Shopping (NS) procedures for publishing of materials (US$0.2 million), and&#13;
contracts up to US$50,000 each would be used for locally available, off-the-shelf&#13;
equipment and furniture items of small value and standard specifications up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$200,000; three quotations would be required.&#13;
Procurement of Pharnaceuticals&#13;
4.12   Procurement of US$8.7 million of essential drugs is a critical element in the Project and will&#13;
require special attention. All pharmaceutical procurement will follow World Bank Guidelines and the&#13;
policies established for financing procurement of pharmaceuticals and vaccines2.  International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used for pharmaceuticals estimated to cost US$8.4&#13;
million. ICB Procurement for the Project, for pharmaceuticals, taken together with other equipment and&#13;
supplies will amount to about 83 % of all goods and pharmaceutical costs. The Bank's "Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines" dated September, 1993 will be used for&#13;
ICB pharmaceutical contracts over US$300,000. Preparation of bidding documents for the first annual&#13;
tranche of drug procurement in a form acceptable to the Association is a condition of effectiveness. For&#13;
procurement of packages less than US$300,000, International Shopping will be used in an amount not&#13;
to exceed US$300,000. For certain drugs required under the TB component, which would involve close&#13;
cooperation with WHO, procurement of up to US$50,000 of drugs may be done through UN agencies,&#13;
where it can be demonstrated that speedier service and more economical prices are a result. In all such&#13;
cases, the World Bank's procurement policies and procedures would apply. For pharmaceuticals available&#13;
from only one source, Direct Contracting (DC), in an amount not to exceed US$50,000, would be used,&#13;
and prices would be derived from drug price bulletins issued periodically by UNICEF and similar sources&#13;
to determine reasonableness of prices offered by single bidders. The Project would finance the&#13;
procurement of drugs included on an Essential Drug List prepared by the Borrower and approved by&#13;
WHO. Standard bidding documents will be used and procurement will be under generic names.&#13;
Procurement lists will be published in "Development Business" six months prior to initiating procurement&#13;
to allow for any necessary registration. Registration of a drug would have to be completed before it can&#13;
be supplied in the Kyrgyz Republic. An exception to this requirement of completed registration could&#13;
be made, with the approval of the Association, for drugs registered in an OECD country or in the Russian&#13;
Federation. Also, all drugs to be financed under the Project would have to be registered in their own&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
country of manufacture and authorization certificates from all original manufacturers will be required.&#13;
Drugs will be in standard formulation in agreed packages and no non-standard pack and mini powder bulk&#13;
material will be permitted except for such items which are procured for compounding of ointments and&#13;
mixtures at the dispensary level. Any special disease drugs procured will be per international treatment&#13;
regimens acceptable to WHO and UNICEF.&#13;
4.13   The MOH  would be responsible for final determination of the type and quantity of&#13;
pharmaceuticals to be purchased. The PCU would be responsible for administering the process and&#13;
ensure that all Bank Guidelines are followed. A pharmaceutical consultant may assist the MOH and the&#13;
PCU to develop the technical specifications of all pharmaceutical procurement. Wholesalers in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic will sign an agreement with the MOH that details the respective responsibilities of each&#13;
in the distribution of drugs. Preparation of these distribution agreements in a form acceptable to the&#13;
Association is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.14   Procurement from UN Agencies. Should it be determined that procurement of drugs and other&#13;
related medical supplies in the health sector could be carried out in a more efficient and effective way&#13;
from UNICEF or other UN Agencies, then such procedure could be used, subject to prior review by the&#13;
Association.&#13;
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods&#13;
4.15   For contracts for goods, including pharmaceuticals, to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the&#13;
Borrower may grant a margin of preference of 15% or the amount of applicable customs duties,&#13;
whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods in accordance with World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
Procurement of Consulting Services&#13;
4.16   Consulting Services (US$3.3 million). Specialists and/or consulting firms financed under the&#13;
Project would be hired in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August, 1981. For specialized short-term&#13;
consulting services to the PCU an amount of US$90,000 (4 person months of specialized short-term&#13;
procurement advice) will be authorized, as an amendment to the on-going contract with the firm providing&#13;
long-term procurement advice to the PCU selected competitively and already in place under the Social&#13;
Safety Net Project. This arrangement would insure continuity and fast response. There will be a need&#13;
to consult closely with WHO on the introduction of modem medical practices that meet WHO guidelines,&#13;
and approximately 25 consultant months of WHO individual specialist services will be sought, largely&#13;
for the Primary Health Care component.&#13;
4.17   The Provider Payments component will require the services of an international firm for up to 34&#13;
person months of specialized technical assistance (US$820,000). The component will extend the lessons&#13;
of the reform program now underway in the Issyk-Kul oblast. The Issyk-Kul pilot project will continue&#13;
until December 31, 1996, and recommendations on the basis of the evaluation of its impact and&#13;
effectiveness will be incorporated into the Health Project.  Consultants previously hired by the&#13;
Government for the Issyk-Kul pilot project under previous financing may be considered for submission&#13;
of a proposal to assist in carrying out the Provider Payments component, with the prior approval of the&#13;
Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
4.18  In addition, approximately 390 consultant years of local consultants (US$870,000) will be&#13;
required to implement the sub-components of the provider payment component. Over the four year&#13;
period of project implemeritation, this will involve approximately 100 local consultants a year, of which&#13;
more than 50% (220 person years) will be involved in the management of the 300 family practice groups&#13;
being formed under the Project. These local consultants will be selected and hired under contracts used&#13;
by the TCC for local consultants which have been approved by the Association. The TCC would prepare&#13;
a manual outlining the procedures used for selection and hiring of these consultants. The management&#13;
of these contracts will be under the administration of the specialized associations being created under the&#13;
Project to represent the interests of the various medical groups, i.e the Primary Care Physicians&#13;
Association, the Health Fund, the Hospital Association, and the Accreditation Commission. The TCC&#13;
will oversee the hiring process and the PCU has developed standard documentation for employment,&#13;
reporting and payments. The Association has reviewed and approved this documentation. Annex 8&#13;
provides the descriptions of the Terms of Reference for the proposed consultants. Local consultants will&#13;
also be provided to the TCC and PCU (54 person years) and local consultants/engineers (15 person&#13;
years).&#13;
Training&#13;
4.19 Training (US$1.2 million). For local and overseas training and study tours financed under the&#13;
Project, the qualifications of candidates along with their course of study, and proposed training&#13;
institutions and costs, and in-country local training courses would be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Association. Candidates would be selected on the basis of established criteria, to be agreed upon with&#13;
the Association as part of the annual reviews. Local training courses will be offered in Bishkek and at&#13;
model hospital facilities in the oblasts throughout the country. Up to 200 short-term training courses&#13;
(averaging about one week in length) will be offered to approximately 4000 medical and administrative&#13;
personnel of the MOH. The Government's Training Center, the Center of Continuous Medical Education&#13;
(CCME) will organize and manage most of this training activity at its facilities in Bishkek and Osh.&#13;
Other training will be carried out at model hospital facilities participating in the program, utilizing&#13;
trainers trained at the CCME who will then travel to the different oblast and raion sites to mount short&#13;
term courses there. The CCME is the only professional medical training facility servicing the medical&#13;
community and the MOH in the country. The Project will finance approximately US$400,000 of local&#13;
training costs, and US$400,000 of international training. The Government will contribute US$400,000&#13;
for local training costs. Annex 9 summarizes the training to be financed under the Project.&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
4.20   Project Administration (US$0.6 million) consists of the Technical Coordination Committee (TCC)&#13;
and the PCU. Part V of this report provides a full description of the arrangements for project&#13;
administration and management. The PCU has signed an inter-ministerial agreement with the MOH.&#13;
The PCU currently has a procurement consulting firm under contract.&#13;

Notification of Business Opportunities&#13;
4.21   A General Procurement Notice was published in the March 31, 1996 edition of the UN&#13;
publication Development Business and, as appropriate, would be updated and published annually&#13;
thereafter. For pharmaceuticals, the list of essential drugs to be procured in the first year of the Project&#13;
was published in this notice to give bidders the opportunity to register their drugs. This will be the list&#13;
of drugs which may be financed under the Credit. For goods to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding&#13;
opportunities would be advertised in a major local newspaper 30 days prior to availability of bidding&#13;
documents and transmitted to potential bidders who expressed interest in bidding in response to the&#13;
published General Procurement Notice. The local advertisement procedure would be repeated for all&#13;
bidding packages utilizing ICB. These advertisements would be in the English language.&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
4.22   A PPF (P-923-KG Health) in the amount of US$0.5 million was signed June 14, 1995 and&#13;
amended on December 28, 1995 to advance project preparation. Work includes consulting services to&#13;
the TCC and the PCU for the preparation of procurement arrangements, and to the component areas of&#13;
Primary Health Care, Facilities Rehabilitation, Provider Payments and Pharmaceutical Management.&#13;
Study tours and a limited amount of equipment and supplies are also eligible expenses. Rehabilitation&#13;
of the Drug Testing Laboratory was initiated under small scale civil works. Procurement will follow&#13;
Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Review By the Association of Procurement Decisions&#13;
4.23   The documentation for all procurement transactions not subject to prior review by the Association&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review during the Association's periodic project supervision missions. To&#13;
ensure compliance with the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines the following procurement actions&#13;
would be subject to prior Association review:&#13;
(a)    Civil Works: All works (including repairs to existing facilities and installation of equipment)&#13;
shall be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts. The PCU will use a simplified version&#13;
of the standard bidding documents, developed by ECA region, which would be based on a&#13;
simplified bill of quantities including, inter alia, the method of payment and a form of contract.&#13;
The PCU would be responsible for the evaluation and recommendation of award of contracts.&#13;
Technical verification of the work carried out would also be the responsibility of the PCU in&#13;
cooperation with the MOH. Prior to award the Association would review the first two&#13;
rehabilitation contracts for work on health facilities and monitor other awards and works on a&#13;
selective basis during project supervision.&#13;
(b)  Goods induding pharmaceuticals: In general, pre-identified master lists of goods, indicating&#13;
grouping, along with estimates of cost and proposed method of procurement would be pre-&#13;
reviewed by the Association. Items would be grouped to the extent practical to encourage&#13;
competitive bidding and to permit bulk procurement. Bidding documents, evaluations and&#13;
recommendations of awards for goods and pharmaceuticals procured under DC and ICB would&#13;
be subject to prior review by the Association.&#13;
(c)  Consultants: The selection of consultant firms and individuals would be in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August, 1981). Terms of Reference for all&#13;
consulting assignments would be subject to prior review by the Association. Terms and&#13;
conditions of contracts for all technical assistance assignments, invitation packages and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
reports of assignments costing more than US$100,000 each for firms, and US$50,000 each for&#13;
individual consultants would be subject to prior review by the Association. The use of WHO&#13;
consultants for specialized medical expertise associated with introduction of WHO standards&#13;
would be in accordance with the Bank's policy on use of Advisory Services by UN Agencies&#13;
Under Bank-Financed Projects.&#13;
4.24   After award, should any material modifications or waiver of the terns and conditions of a&#13;
contract result in an increase above 15% of the original price, the Association would reserve the right&#13;
of prior review of such modifications (included would be modifications in contracts for consulting&#13;
services).&#13;
4.25   General Review: The Association would monitor procurement activities, contract management,&#13;
and project record-keeping during supervision missions. The Association would undertake a focussed&#13;
project launch workshop in June, 1996 and a comprehensive mid-term review of project progress; both&#13;
activities would place special emphasis on implementation including procurement matters.&#13;
Procurement Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.26   The PCU would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a computerized procurement&#13;
monitoring and reporting system acceptable to the Association. Status reports from this system would&#13;
accompany the PCU's regular quarterly project progress reports sent to the Association.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)&#13;
4.27   Preparation of a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is in progress for the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic. The Government has initiated reforms in the public procurement system and new legislation&#13;
is expected in March, 1996. Following this standard procurement documents specifically designed for&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic will be developed.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
Schedule&#13;
4.28   The proposed Credit would be disbursed over about five years which includes six months for the&#13;
finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications and other reports. No standard&#13;
disbursement profile exists for the Kyrgyz Republic. The Project is expected to be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2000 with a Credit Closing Date of June 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Goods and Services                            10.9       100% of foreign expenditures,&#13;
100% of local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory costs), and 75% of&#13;
local expenditures for goods&#13;
procured locally&#13;

4.30   The standard disbursement profile for population, health &amp;  nutrition projects requires&#13;
approximately 32 quarters or eight years to disburse a credit. Notwithstanding this profile, the pattern&#13;
of disbursement for this Project has most of the funding for training and technical assistance taking place&#13;
during the first two years of project execution. A five year period is shown above as it is expected that&#13;
the Project will become effective early in FY97. The last year of disbursement anticipates final&#13;
disbursements in FY01. The Project's administrative arrangements are already in place and operating&#13;
under the PPF and there is a mobilized and trained Project Coordination Unit in place and working.&#13;
Procurement actions for civil works have been prepared under the PPF and would be ready to initiate&#13;
upon Credit effectiveness. Bidding documents for the first year's drug purchase will be prepared under&#13;
the PPF and would be ready to issue upon Credit effectiveness. The positive list of the drugs eligible&#13;
to be financed under the Credit has been published in Development Business on March 31, 1996 and the&#13;
drug testing laboratory has been rehabilitated under the PPF to allow early registration. The entire PPF&#13;
(US$0.5 million) is expected to be disbursed before Credit effectiveness. The disbursement schedule in&#13;
Table 4.4 allows for some lag time in actual disbursements to account for normal delays in preparation&#13;
and presentation of documentation. While ambitious, the disbursement schedule is attainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
4.31   For expenditures relating to (a) contracts for goods valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent,&#13;
and (b) contracts for works each valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, reimbursements would be&#13;
made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The documentation to support these expenditures&#13;
would be retained by the PCU for their respective project activities for at least one year, after receipt by&#13;
the Association of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made.  This&#13;
documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and Association supervision missions.&#13;
Disbursements for all other items would be made against full documentation and respect procurement&#13;
guidelines where applicable. Supervision missions would review documentation retained by the Borrower&#13;
in the field. If ineligible expenditures, included those not justified by the evidence furnished, or amounts&#13;
in excess of agreed disbursement percentages are financed from the Special Account, the Association&#13;
would have the right to withhold further deposits into the Special Account. The Association may exercise&#13;
this right until the borrower has: (i) refunded the amounts involved, or (ii) (if the Association agrees)&#13;
submitted evidence of other eligible expenditures that the Association can use to offset the ineligible&#13;
amounts. The minimum amount of each withdrawal application for direct payment would be US$50,000.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
4.32   To facilitate and expedite disbursements, a Special Account (SA) in dollars would be established&#13;
by the Borrower in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. An initial&#13;
deposit of US$250,000 would be made, representing estimated average expenditures to be paid from the&#13;
SA over a three-month period. To facilitate payments of rehabilitation activities, funds may be&#13;
transferred when payments are due or not more than 90 days in advance in Kyrgyz som directly from the&#13;
SA to bank accounts in branches or correspondent banks at the oblast or city level. All foreign&#13;
expenditure payments would be made directly from the Special Account. The amount of the initial&#13;
deposit will be reviewed after six months and, if necessary, increased.&#13;
4.33   The Special Account would be in the name of the Borrower and would be administered by&#13;
authorized staff of the PCU. Applications for replenishment of the SA would be submitted to the&#13;
Association by the PCU monthly or whenever the account is drawn down by about 50% of the initial&#13;
deposit, whichever comes first.&#13;
4.34   The SA would be maintained in a commercial bank. It has been confirmed that the chosen bank&#13;
must be capable of meeting the requirements of the Association with respect to opening and maintaining&#13;
the SA. The bank chosen must be: (i) financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as audited&#13;
by an internationally recognized auditing firm; (ii) have a significant foreign correspondence network&#13;
covering all major currencies; (iii) have a reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit,&#13;
for making direct foreign payments and other international transactions with appropriate arrangements&#13;
for the training and development of its staff; (iv) be capable of performing a wide range of local banking&#13;
services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit notes, application&#13;
of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance of adequate accounts for the SA; (v) be&#13;
willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited in the SA would not be set off or&#13;
otherwise seized or attached to satisfy amounts due to the bank by the Borrower; (vi) be willing to&#13;
maintain adequate accounts as required by the Association, provide to the Association monthly bank&#13;
statements, and any other information considered necessary (copies of all transactions would be routinely&#13;
submitted to the implementing agencies); and (vii) be willing to charge reasonable rates for its services&#13;
and provide reasonable interest on balances held from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
E. Project Accounts, Budgets and Audits&#13;
Project Accounts and Budgets&#13;
4.35   Financing of project activities would proceed through a Project Account (PA) to be opened by&#13;
the PCU, through which project funds would be channeled.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.36   The Borrower would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by the&#13;
Association under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the&#13;
financial statements or reports are submitted to the Association. Under the PPF, a computerized&#13;
accounting system identical to the one already established for the Social Safety Net Project, has been&#13;
established under the PCU's financial reporting system. The project accountant in the PCU would&#13;
maintain consolidated accounts for the Project and would prepare quarterly financial reports. The&#13;
accounts would be maintained for all project funds, i.e. Credit funds and local contribution.&#13;
4.37   All project records and accounts, including those for the SOEs, the SA, and PA would be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with the "World Bank Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank," (March 1982). An international auditing firm would be appointed to&#13;
perform project audits. The Association would be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal&#13;
year with an audit report of such scope and detail as the Association may reasonably request, including&#13;
a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified statement of expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
PART V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION AND&#13;
SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
5.1    The Project is in an advanced stage of preparation. The Ministry of Health has established a&#13;
Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) and appointed a director, and four technical component&#13;
coordinators (CCs) for each of the major activities in the Project: primary health care, facilities&#13;
rehabilitation, medical care provider payment and pharmaceutical management. The MOH has also&#13;
signed an agreement with the existing Project Coordination Unit for the Social Safety Net Project, which&#13;
will be used to manage the procurement, disbursement and administrative reporting requirements of the&#13;
proposed Health Sector Reform Project. Two MOH staff are seconded to work within the PCU, receive&#13;
hands-on training and ensure close coordination between the two entities.&#13;
5.2    A pilot TB project, funded by the Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant from&#13;
the Japanese Government, began in October, 1995 to ensure it fits within the Project's overall objectives&#13;
to make more effective use of scarce resources by reducing the length of hospitalization, number of beds,&#13;
and other costly interventions. The pilot will serve to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of comparing&#13;
partial hospital based treatment for TB to a fully ambulatory treatment from the beginning of therapy.&#13;
The results of the pilot project will guide the final choice of diagnostic and treatment policies for the IDA&#13;
supported Health Project.&#13;
5.3    USAID is funding a provider payment pilot project in Issyk-kul Oblast. A three year effort, due&#13;
to complete its first phase in December 1996, it will provide excellent experience and working models&#13;
for wider application. An evaluation of this experience will be conducted by the Government using PPF&#13;
funding. The results will be incorporated into the IDA-funded Project, which is due to begin immediately&#13;
after effectiveness.&#13;
5.4    Understandings have been reached during the pre-appraisal mission with other donors on&#13;
collaboration with regards to certain aspects of the Project. The roles of UNICEF and IDA supported&#13;
projects in the area of ARI/CDD have now been defined. Similarly, the roles of GTZ and IDA have&#13;
been better delineated, so that promotional activities in adult health lifestyles and family health will&#13;
complement and support each other so that program and resources can be strengthened and expanded.&#13;
B. Overall Project Management and Implementation&#13;
5.5    The overall implementation and administration of the Project will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. To assist in the various aspects of the Project, the MOH will depend upon several&#13;
entities to provide policy advice, technical direction and specialized services. These will be carried out,&#13;
respectively, by a Project Policy Council (PPC), a Technical Coordination Committee (TCC), and the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Social Safety Net Project. Annex 6 provides a description of the&#13;
management and implementation arrangements.&#13;
Project Policy Council&#13;
5.6    The Project Policy Council, which was formed in July, 1995, will oversee the policies undertaken&#13;
by the MOH and other entities involved in project implementation to reform the health sector. The&#13;
Project Policy Council is chaired by the Minister of Health or his designee, and members include MOH&#13;
Deputy Ministers, representatives from the involved departments of the MOH, Chui and Issyk-kul Oblasts&#13;
and Bishkek city medical officials, Pharmacia, representatives from the medical community and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
representative from the Ministry of Finance. It will advise the Minister on all important policy aspects&#13;
of the Project and would meet once every three months, or more often if its Chairman so decides. The&#13;
Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) would serve as the secretariat of the Project Policy Council.&#13;
Technical Coordination Committee&#13;
5.7    The Technical Coordination Committee, which has been formed and has been operational since&#13;
August 1995, will manage the technical implementation of the Project. The TCC is headed by a Director&#13;
who reports to the designated Deputy Minister of Health, who serves as the Ministry's counterpart and&#13;
chief liaison officer with the Association for the Project, on a day-to-day basis. It is comprised of a full-&#13;
time Director and four technical advisors, found acceptable to the Association, who are designated as&#13;
Component Coordinators. The Director has a relevant degree and experience in the health sector. The&#13;
Director and technical staff are assisted by one administrative assistant. The TCC functions on a&#13;
permanent basis during the course of the Project. In addition, current operating personnel from each&#13;
organization who are assigned to implement a specific activity (e.g. tuberculosis, drug regulatory&#13;
organization, etc.) within each of the four components would be named as a liaison person to the TCC,&#13;
and would be responsible for the day-to-day management of their respective activities.&#13;
5.8    The TCC provides the technical direction to the several components and subcomponents. It&#13;
formulates and recommends for approval any policy reforms associated with the Project, and periodically&#13;
assesses the status of and progress towards overall project goals. It coordinates activities among the&#13;
components, and also coordinates the project's activities with the other donor activities in the health&#13;
sector. It coordinates the budget planning and control of project funds, and coordinates with the Ministry&#13;
of Finance as required. Problems which are not resolved at the component level are to be raised to the&#13;
entire TCC. The TCC will request and authorize the PCU to prepare disbursement documentation for&#13;
signature by the Minister or his designee for payment of goods and services. Finally, the TCC maintains&#13;
progress indicators, designs and arranges for periodic project evaluations and manages the periodic&#13;
meetings of the Project Policy Council. Before negotiations the MOH has provided office space, local&#13;
telephone service, local transportation expenses, an administrative assistant and two positions seconded&#13;
to the PCU funded through MOH budgetary resources. During negotiations assurances were obtained&#13;
that the Borrower shall maintain the TCC with adequate authorities to effectively coordinate the activities&#13;
under the Project under the management of a director and four component coordinators, all with&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Association, assisted by an administrative assistant. The&#13;
project finances specialized technical services, the TCC Director, the four TCC technical component&#13;
coordinators, office equipment and one vehicle.&#13;
5.9    During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Borrower would prepare, under terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Association, on or about August 31 of each year, an annual progress report&#13;
integrating the results of its monitoring and evaluation activities on the progress achieved in the carrying&#13;
out of the Project and the action plan during the period preceding the date of said report and setting out&#13;
the measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the Project and the achievement of the&#13;
Project's objectives during the period following such date; and review with the Association, by October&#13;
15 of each year, or such later date as the Association shall request, said report and thereafter take all&#13;
measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the Project and the achievement of the objectives&#13;
thereof, based on the conclusions and recommendations of the said report and the Association's view on&#13;
the matter. The Government would make annual allocations and execute budgetary resources to the MOH&#13;
in accordance with the funding requirements of the Project, and in accordance with its policy statement&#13;
dated April 5, 1996 to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
Component Coordinators&#13;
5.10   The Director of the TCC is assisted by four technical Component Coordinators (CCs) who&#13;
provide policy and technical direction to the four functional sectors of activity under the Project, namely&#13;
(i) primary health care, (ii) pharmaceutical management, (iii) medical care provider payment, and (iv)&#13;
facilities management. The CC's responsibility is to ensure that the day-to-day managers, i.e. the&#13;
individuals within each activity who are assigned the responsibility of implementing specific activities,&#13;
receive the necessary support and policy guidance to execute their activities, and also to ensure that the&#13;
separate activities are coordinated within the overall program of reform. This includes the coordination&#13;
with other donor activities, and the sharing of information and problem solving among all the&#13;
participating agencies and entities. They are responsible for preparing training plans and arranging for&#13;
their execution within their respective sector. They are responsible for reporting to the TCC Director&#13;
all significant activities, progress, problems or policy issues which emerge in their sector, and making&#13;
recommendations for action. They follow up on all relevant recommendations of the Project Policy&#13;
Council, and prepare or cause to be prepared any reports required in the execution of the activities within&#13;
their sector.&#13;
Project Coordination Unit&#13;
5.11   The PCU of the Social Safety Net Project, which is under implementation, has been requested&#13;
to serve as the procurement and administrative consultant of the MOH for the Health Sector Reform&#13;
Project under the PPF. The MOH has negotiated and signed an intergovernmental agreement with the&#13;
PCU which will reimburse the PCU for those direct and indirect costs associated with the Health Project,&#13;
and these costs shall be funded under the Credit. The PCU will service the specific needs of the Project&#13;
in those administrative functions required for efficient project management and implementation; it will&#13;
do so at a cost considerably less than setting up a separate PCU in the MOH. Before negotiations the&#13;
MOH has provided the PCU with two positions, which at the end of the Project would revert to the MOH&#13;
and serve as a nucleus for the MOH to establish a procurement capability within the MOH in the future.&#13;
These MOH staff working within the PCU will receive hands-on training, and ensure close coordination&#13;
between the two entities. Salaries will be paid from the MOH budget. The Project will finance the&#13;
services of general and specialized procurement specialists in pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and&#13;
civil works adrninistration. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Borrower shall&#13;
maintain the PCU and vest it with the responsibility for procurement, preparation of disbursement&#13;
requests and reporting in respect of the Project under the management of a director, with qualification&#13;
and experience acceptable to the Association, assisted by support staff in adequate numbers. Specifically,&#13;
the PCU will perform the following functions:&#13;
(a)  Procurement:  provide assistance, advice, and contract management to the implementing&#13;
departments and entities in the procurement of civil works, equipment, pharmaceuticals and&#13;
related services. It would also provide assistance, advice and contract management in the&#13;
recruitment of consultants and technical assistance/training services. The PCU would prepare&#13;
all tender documents and technical specifications, and manage the process of receiving and&#13;
evaluating competitive proposals (with the active participation of the TCC and Component&#13;
Coordinators within the TCC). Ensure that all procurement actions meet Bank Guidelines and&#13;
that Association no objections are sought and obtained as necessary.&#13;
(b)  Finance and Accounting: prepare and maintain detailed project and summary accounting and&#13;
financial analysis records and reports. It would also arrange for and execute all necessary project&#13;
account audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
(c)  Disbursements: acting on the advice of the TCC and the Component Coordinators within the&#13;
TCC, prepare and process Bank withdrawal applications and disbursements of project funds, and&#13;
maintain all necessary special accounts of project funds.&#13;
(d)  Reporting: prepare all necessary reports required by the Association. For technical and periodic&#13;
quarterly progress reports, the PCU will insure that the TCC and Component Coordinators&#13;
prepare their contributions in a timely manner.&#13;
(e)  Civil Works: Design and implement a system of supervision involving the local comrrmunity,&#13;
MOH on-site personnel and independent engineers.&#13;
(f)  Training: train the MOH on-site personnel in accounting.&#13;
C. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.12   The Project includes a mechanism for monitoring the progress in its implementation and&#13;
measuring its impact. This mechanism is based on a set of indicators developed specifically for each of&#13;
the subcomponents of the Primary Health Care component and for the Facilities Rehabilitation, the&#13;
Medical Provider Payment and the Pharmaceutical Management components. The indicators are adjusted&#13;
to the disparities in the complexity and newness of the Project's various activities. Annex 11 provides a&#13;
detailed description of actions to be taken by the Government as well as details on the performance&#13;
monitoring indicators. Monitoring is carried out by the TCC, assisted by consultants.&#13;
5.13   The most important expected result of the Primary Health Care component is to improve the&#13;
health status of the population, concurrent with Ministry of Health and MANAS goals.  This&#13;
improvement in health status will be achieved by expanding effective ambulatory care for diseases of&#13;
importance and by providing the essential drugs, facilities, training and equipment to do such. As a result&#13;
of this rationally targeted expansion of the ambulatory care system along with accepted clinical and&#13;
preventive protocols, access to appropriate care improves by definition and quality of care parameters will&#13;
indicate a definite improvement.&#13;
5.14   An important aspect of the progress of the Project will involve the close monitoring of the&#13;
schedule and rate of rationalization of health facilities. Much of the economic analysis derives from the&#13;
ability and commitment of the health authorities to undertake a serious examination of the extent to which&#13;
consolidation of present redundant health facilities and the amount of budget resources they absorb can&#13;
be redirected towards primary health care and essential services. The MANAS program will specifically&#13;
address this issue, and the policy paper presented by the Government will propose general targets and&#13;
objectives. The reviews conducted by the Association during the Project will specifically address this&#13;
issue and annual discussions with the Borrower will include progress to date and expected results in the&#13;
coming year.&#13;
5.15   Other expected results will be to improve the clinical effectiveness of the delivery system by&#13;
introducing and disseminating tested and accepted ambulatory treatment protocols for PHC targeted&#13;
diseases. The concurrent provision of needed pharmaceutical in an efficient and safe health service&#13;
facility will result in the improved clinical effectiveness of the delivery system. When a health system's&#13;
clinical effectiveness occurs within the framework of targeting diseases of importance from mortality and&#13;
morbidity points of view, the health status of the population improves. The Medical Care Provider&#13;
Payment component methodology is intended to encourage providers to treat patients on an out-patient&#13;
basis, discourage unnecessary referrals and reduce hospital days. This, along with changes in protocols&#13;
formed under the other components, is expected to result in savings and efficiencies in the system.&#13;

PART VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Framework and Justification&#13;
Integration in Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
6.1    The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for FY96-98 for the Kyrgyz Republic is designed&#13;
to support the transition to a more market-oriented and macroeconomically stable economy by (i)&#13;
facilitating growth; (ii) supporting structural reform; (iii) assisting the Government to protect vulnerable&#13;
groups; and, (iv) strengthening institutional capacity. The proposed project is an integral part of this&#13;
strategy. Health service delivery, predominantly financed and provided by the public sector, is a key area&#13;
for structural reform. The proposed project aims to assist the Government to rationalize expenditures in&#13;
the health sector and place it on a more cost-effective and sustainable financial basis through extensive&#13;
structural reform of the health service delivery system. This is also consistent with the recommendations&#13;
of the recent Poverty Assessment which emphasized, inter alia, the importance of using public social&#13;
expenditure funds as effectively as possible in order that quality of, and access to, basic social services&#13;
can be improved.&#13;
Choice of Project Interventions&#13;
6.2    The Project aims to assist the Government to (a) reorient public resource flows to more cost-&#13;
effective interventions; (b) sustain cost-effective choices by medical providers through changes in the&#13;
incentive structure; and, (c) achieve health gains through strengthening the quality of care at primary&#13;
levels (ambulatory polyclinics and FAPs).&#13;
6.3    Although the current financial crisis has placed great strain on the quality and availability of&#13;
health services, the emphasis of the proposed project is not on short-term financing but on structural&#13;
reform. The analysis of the health system presented in Part I emphasized the structural inefficiencies&#13;
which characterize the sector. Additional financial resources for the sector without reforms to encourage&#13;
cost-effective resource use would result in scarce public funds achieving less health effects than they&#13;
potentially could. Furthermnore, the pervasive biases in resource allocation patterns indicate that there&#13;
is considerable scope for savings to be gained through rationalization of resource use in more cost-&#13;
effective directions. Realization of these potential gains and re-investment into the health sector would&#13;
enable the Government to improve the quality and availability of services, even in the current fiscal crisis.&#13;
In other words, application of cost-effectiveness criteria to project design narrows the apparent policy gap&#13;
between short-term resource needs and longer-term reform needs.&#13;
6.4    Cost-effectiveness in the context of the health sector is defined as the achievement of the highest&#13;
health gains (measured by DALYs) at the lowest cost. Although cost-effectiveness was most explicitly&#13;
applied in the selection of interventions to be financed within the Primary Health Care component, its&#13;
broader application resulted in other Project components focusing on the strengthening of ambulatory care&#13;
more generally, given the current overemphasis on tertiary and inpatient care and given that there are&#13;
relatively few cost-effective inpatient interventions.&#13;
6.5    Successful implementation of a program to upgrade ambulatory care will reduce the demand for&#13;
hospital based care at the tertiary and secondary levels. The redirection of this demand towards a&#13;
strengthened integrated PHC level will imply that inpatient resources previously utilized to treat some&#13;
health conditions will become redundant. Project interventions are likely to demonstrate the potential for&#13;
savings which would be released if the excess inpatient capacity was reduced. Actual realization of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
savings would require the Government to close redundant facilities and to reassign or release staff from&#13;
inpatient facilities.&#13;
6.6    The Project itself does not design a program of facility or staff rationalization, although it&#13;
recognizes that these measures would be necessary in order to guarantee potential savings which could&#13;
be reinvested into primary health care. By strengthening the ability of the primary level to deliver&#13;
outpatient care, however, the project design will raise the visibility of excess inpatient capacity,&#13;
demonstrate that this excess capacity could be reduced without adverse health impacts, provide incentives&#13;
through changes in both provider payment systems and medical practice, and thereby strengthen the&#13;
ability of the Government to begin the difficult process of closures and staff rationalization. Additionally,&#13;
even if facility rationalization is undertaken slowly, and potential savings are slow to be realized, health&#13;
gains can still be expected as a result of improved diagnostic and treatment capacity in the primary care&#13;
levels. These issues are elaborated in the section on Risks and Limitations.&#13;
Systemic Approach&#13;
6.7    The approach of the proposed project is a systemic one aiming to change clinical protocols and&#13;
the regulatory, payment and management structures underlying inefficient resource use, rather than a&#13;
vertical approach targeting specific clinical programs alone (e.g. TB). Although the systemic approach&#13;
leads to a more complex project than would be expected from a vertical approach, it was the preferred&#13;
design. This is in view of international experience which suggests poor sustainability of improvements&#13;
to specific programs without accompanying changes in the system-wide incentives which resulted in&#13;
inefficient resource allocation and use in the first place. In order to monitor impact of the proposed&#13;
changes and in view of limited implementation capacity, however, the Project does not attempt to&#13;
intervene in all areas where structural reforms are deemed necessary. Some of the more significant&#13;
limitations of the project design are elaborated in section C below on Risks and Limitations.&#13;
B. Benefits&#13;
6.8    An effort is made to identify benefits expected from each component. It is necessary to bear in&#13;
mind, however, that the proposed interventions are integrally linked to each other and will jointly affect&#13;
outcomes in many cases. Cost benefit analysis is not attempted because both costs and benefits are shared&#13;
across components which have different coverage levels, and because it is very difficult to establish direct&#13;
causal links between project interventions and health benefits, let alone to measure these benefits. The&#13;
emphasis of the current analysis is on establishing the cost-effectiveness of project interventions.&#13;
Component A: Primary Health Care&#13;
Application of Cost-effectiveness Criteria&#13;
6.9    In identifying priority interventions within PHC areas, it was necessary to consider the incidence&#13;
or prevalence of the disease, the likely gains in potential years of life and/or disability adjusted life years&#13;
(DALY) resulting from the burden of disease, the effectiveness of the intervention, and the cost of the&#13;
intervention. A variant of the DALY methodology presented in the World Bank's 1993 World&#13;
Development Report was applied to the Kyrgyz situation (see note to Table 6.1 below).&#13;

Notes:   *the analysis was performed for all diseases;&#13;
*in order to focus on conditions that had a significant impact on the health status of the population, a cutoff&#13;
for all conditions was established at 20,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) saved, or diseases which&#13;
were likely to have dynamic transmission (i.e. highly infectious diseases); only conditions meeting one or&#13;
the other of these two criteria were included in the next phase of the analysis;&#13;
ebased on the existing health services literature, conditions that have cost-effective interventions (defined as&#13;
costing less than US$350 per DALY saved) were considered for inclusion in the Project;&#13;
-from this list, only those interventions were chosen which are cost-effective from a curative or preventive&#13;
perspective and can be provided in an outpatient primary care setting.&#13;
6.10     Based on the DALY  analysis support to 10 conditions can be offered through ambulatory care&#13;
and is a cost-effective approach--tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, childhood cluster (i.e. expanded&#13;
program of immunization), ARI, STDs, matemal conditions, perinatal conditions,&#13;
nutritional/endocrine, and cardiovascular conditions. Taking into account the cost-effectiveness&#13;
analysis and the existing pattem of donor support, the proposed project focuses on ARI/CDD, WRH&#13;
(which includes STDs), and TB. Together, these interventions target a significant portion of the&#13;
burden of disease and use limited funds in a very cost-effective manner. The PHC component will&#13;
finance training, pharmaceuticals and equipment (particularly for TB) necessary to implement new&#13;
medical protocols emphasizing prevention and the use of arnbulatory care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
Potential for Fiscal Benefits&#13;
6.11   The introduction of new treatment protocols emphasizing ambulatory care will not directly&#13;
lead to fiscal savings but will demonstrate the lower cost of provision of a service as compared to the&#13;
inpatient alternative. The source of these potential savings are from reductions in the hospital length&#13;
of stay and number of hospitalizations (admissions), which in turn would imply lower inpatient staff&#13;
and facility needs. To realize these savings, inpatient facilities and staff would have to be reduced.&#13;
This would lead to realized savings in the form of saved salaries (plus payroll contributions) and&#13;
utilities costs which together, in 1994, on average accounted for 66% of the operating costs of health&#13;
facilities.&#13;
6.12   An exercise was undertaken to estimate the magnitude of savings expected from changes in&#13;
the TB treatment protocols. A costing exercise was done for 1996 using 1994 prices to estimate the&#13;
cost of treatment of all TB cases if current protocols were not changed (the without project scenario)&#13;
and if 50% of TB cases were treated according to specified combinations of the proposed protocols&#13;
(three categories) while 50% continued to be treated according to current practice (the expected&#13;
scenario in the first year of the Project). 3&#13;
6.13   The analysis suggests that the cost of treating all TB patients for 1996 could be reduced by about&#13;
28% if only 50% of cases are treated using the new protocols. For subsequent years, as adoption of the&#13;
new protocol expands, the magnitude of potential savings can be expected to increase. Overall, it is&#13;
estimated that successful adoption of the TB protocols could reduce the cost of TB treatment by 25-50%,&#13;
relative to costs under current protocols, for each year of the Project and beyond. The main source of&#13;
these savings is from a reduction in the use of costly inpatient-days and a greater use of outpatient visits&#13;
in the treatment of TB cases. As mentioned, realization of these savings will depend on closure of excess&#13;
inpatient capacity.&#13;
6.14   The TB exercise provides an order of magnitude of potential savings. The methodology could&#13;
be applied to the other PHC interventions (ARI/CDD, WRH), data availability permitting.&#13;
Coverage and Access&#13;
6.15   The coverage of the new protocols is intended to be nationwide across all six oblasts, with a&#13;
population and potential beneficiary pool of 4.5 million. The different subcomponents aim to complete&#13;
training on different schedules and full coverage of the population will be achieved only by the end of&#13;
the Project's completion. The PHC component is likely to increase access to services in at least four&#13;
ways:&#13;
(i)    introduction of ambulatory alternatives to inpatient care will enable the poor, who may&#13;
not have been able to afford costs associated with inpatient care (e.g. lost wages, food,&#13;
bed-linen, etc.) to access treatment which they may otherwise have foregone;&#13;
3/ It must be noted that the comparison is between the scenarios where the full recommended treatment, including&#13;
drugs, under the respective protocol is implemented. In reality, many patients under the current protocol are not&#13;
supplied with the necessary drugs. In actual terms, therefore, actual operating expenses (relative to the current&#13;
situation) may increase if necessary drugs are supplied as recommended under the new protocols. Comparisons of&#13;
cost-effectiveness are meaningless, however, if they are not done across comparable outcomes (i.e. equivalent&#13;
numbers of cases treated and cured). The methodology used here is justified in that the different methods lead to&#13;
the same number of cases cured and the estimate is of potential costs and savings expected in achieving this&#13;
equivalent outcome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
(ii)   improved quality of services in the network of primary care facilities will also reduce the&#13;
transportation costs (time and material) which patients would have bome to access&#13;
inpatient care at the more centralized tertiary care facilities;&#13;
(iii)   provision of basic supplies to all FAPs will especially enable the rural population to&#13;
access basic services without having to incur transportation costs or delays; and&#13;
(iv)   the integration of services in some model sites will enable catchment area populations&#13;
(and also those who travel to these facilities) to obtain services with lower transaction&#13;
costs.&#13;
Health Impact&#13;
6.16   The provision of basic supplies and equipment in support of the new protocols under the PHC&#13;
component is expected to lead to improvements in the quality of services provided. This will lead to&#13;
gains in healthy years of life which would not have been achieved in the absence of the Project. It is&#13;
difficult to quantify expected health impact of the component, however, since exogenous factors (e.g. a&#13;
decline in nutritional status, changes in pollution levels, etc.) may obscure the causal links between&#13;
project interventions and health outcome. As demonstrated, however, the interventions target diseases&#13;
which had a high burden of disease. Moreover, monitorable targets in terms of changes in health&#13;
outcomes will be tracked as part of project performance monitoring.&#13;
Demonstration Effect&#13;
6.17   The PHC component will also finance integration of basic primary health care provision&#13;
(Tuberculosis, AIDS control, Dermatology, Venerology and Family Planning) on unified Model sites&#13;
situated in each oblast at selected oblast and raion facilities.  This will demonstrate the feasibility of&#13;
providing primary care in a unified setting and offer a model to be replicated throughout the country.&#13;
As stated above, the component can further demonstrate the potential savings to be gained from provision&#13;
of services on an ambulatory rather than inpatient basis for the selected interventions. These lessons&#13;
could be replicated for other types of interventions on a nationwide scale.&#13;
Component B: Facilities Rehabilitation&#13;
6.18   The enormous emphasis placed on inpatient care has resulted in the systematic underfunding of&#13;
primary care facilities such as ambulatories and FAPs. As a consequence of successful implementation&#13;
of ambulatory protocols under the PHC component and more cost-effective use of inpatient facilities by&#13;
medical providers under the Medical Care Provider Payment component, greater utilization of outpatient&#13;
facilities and reduced utilization of inpatient facilities is expected. In support of this anticipated change&#13;
in the pattern of utilization, the Facilities Rehabilitation component attempts to expand the physical&#13;
capacity for outpatient care provision. The Project will finance rehabilitation and conversion of existing&#13;
capacity rather than the creation of new facilities.&#13;
6.19   Since the target facilities will be distributed throughout the oblast, the whole population of Chui,&#13;
of 774,000, may be regarded as beneficiaries. This is also likely to result in higher effective gains to the&#13;
poor relative to the non-poor within Chui Oblast, since transportation costs to better resourced city&#13;
facilities are likely to have been more of a constraint to proper medical care for poorer households than&#13;
for others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
6.20   It is not possible to separately identify the gains from investments under the facilities component&#13;
alone, since it complements changes under the PHC and Provider Payments components in the strategy&#13;
to improve ambulatory care provision. For example, services not targeted under the Project, but which&#13;
can be performed in an outpatient setting (e.g. cataract operations), will also benefit from improved&#13;
outpatient facilities. Expansion in effective physical capacity for ambulatory care is essentially an&#13;
enabling factor for implementation of changes under the other project components. In addition, there may&#13;
be significant demonstration effects of this component for further facility rationalization within Chui&#13;
Oblast and for replication of criteria, process, organizational forms, etc. in all the other oblasts.&#13;
6.21   The sustainability of rehabilitation efforts under the component is addressed through the&#13;
reformulation and empowerment of a Buildings and Equipment Committee which will be responsible for&#13;
future maintenance of facilities.&#13;
Component C: Medical Care Provider Payment&#13;
6.22   The Medical Care Provider Payment Component proposes to change the methods used to pay&#13;
physicians, polyclinics and hospitals in order to introduce incentives for these providers to manage&#13;
resources and deliver care more efficiently through greater use of primary care. Payment to medical care&#13;
providers from public funds would no longer be made on the basis of production inputs but on the basis&#13;
of a combination of expected volume of cases, performance and outcome. The payer (in this case, the&#13;
proposed Health Fund) would focus on paying for appropriate care at the lowest cost, while the provider&#13;
(family practitioners and hospitals) would have greater flexibility to manage costs and select protocols&#13;
in delivering care. Under the reforms, the provider would be 'at risk' in that they would be responsible&#13;
for payments received and costs of care.&#13;
6.23   These features should encourage providers to treat patients on an outpatient rather than an&#13;
inpatient basis, discourage unnecessary referrals for specialist or diagnostic services, reduce the rate of&#13;
hospital admissions as well as the length of stay in hospital (LOS). The component will also develop a&#13;
quality assurance system to ensure that quality of services is not compromised. This component attempts&#13;
to reinforce the primary care focus of the other components discussed above.&#13;
6.24   During a phase in period, capitation based payments (i.e. payments per enrolled person to finance&#13;
the costs of a set of services) will be introduced for Family Practice Groups and global budgets for&#13;
hospitals. Over the course of the Project, case-based payment systems will also be introduced in the&#13;
hospital sector. Fee for service (using a fixed schedule) would be introduced for some priority diseases.&#13;
The main advantages and disadvantages of the proposed measures, relative to the current line-item&#13;
budgeting system, may be summarized as follows in Table 6.2 below:&#13;

6.25      Under this component, a mixed payment system  will be adopted in Bishkek City and in Chui&#13;
Oblast, extending models currently being piloted in Issyk-kul Oblast under the auspices of USAID. The&#13;
main expected benefit from the implementation of the Provider Payment component in these areas are&#13;
changes in the utilization pattern of inpatient and outpatient care: decreases will be expected in the&#13;
number of inpatient admissions, the average length of stay, and the number of secondary referrals; an&#13;
increase will be expected in the number of outpatient visits. An attempt was made to model these&#13;
changes in order to obtain an estimate of the impact on total costs of inpatient and outpatient care.&#13;
6.26     In a simplified model for Chui Oblast, three scenarios were estimated:  (i)  the current cost of&#13;
inpatient and outpatient care if number of admissions, length of inpatient stay (LOS), and number of&#13;
outpatient visits were at 1994 levels; (ii) the cost of inpatient and outpatient care if the number of&#13;
admissions and the LOS fell by 10% while the number of outpatient visits increased by 10%; and (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
the same pattern as in scenario 2 except that the expected changes were 20% rather than 10%. The&#13;
results are presented in Table 6.3.&#13;

6.27    In scenario 2, cost of care falls by about 13%  compared to the present, while in scenario 3, the&#13;
potential savings are almost 25 % of current costs.4 The model does not identify whether it is realistic&#13;
to expect changes of 10 or 20% in utilization patterns or what timeframe is being considered. It can be&#13;
said, however, that hospital admission rates in the Kyrgyz Republic are about 15-20% higher than the&#13;
OECD average, while hospital lengths of stay are as much as 50 % higher than OECD levels for selected&#13;
disease categories (although the case-mix is different in the Kyrgyz Republic). Thus the magnitudes of&#13;
change used in the model are not unrealistic. The pace at which efficiency gains can be expected will&#13;
probably accelerate in the latter years of the Project as providers participate and learn to use the new&#13;
systems. A similar exercise was done for Bishkek city.&#13;
6.28    Note: the estimates here reflect the expected effects due not only to changes in the provider&#13;
payment systems but also changes in treatment protocols and facility rehabilitation financed under the&#13;
other components. Moreover, these estimates indicate the level of overall cost reduction that could be&#13;
expected if decisions by providers to utilize primary care alternatives are sustained. It is noted that&#13;
realization of these potential savings is largely dependent on closure of excess inpatient capacity.&#13;
Component D: Pharmaceuticals Management&#13;
6.29    This component attempts to make progress in restructuring regulation, procurement and use of&#13;
pharmaceuticals towards cost-effective ends and to improve the overall supply of medicines. The main&#13;
benefits are expected in the following areas:&#13;
4/Actual savings may be lower than estimates given here since costs saved on the margin may be less than costs&#13;
saved on average. If the Government is committed to rationalize overhead costs such as salaries, any gap between&#13;
marginal and average cost-savings will be reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
Rationali2ing the Composition of Public Spending on Medicines&#13;
6.30   Since drugs procured under the Project will be essential drugs, a significant percentage is likely&#13;
to be dispensed to exempted patients and, hence, to be financed out of local health budgets. If public&#13;
spending levels remain constant, therefore, a greater proportion of public spending on medicines will be&#13;
used to buy cost-effective essential drugs. This change in composition of public drug expenditures is&#13;
expected even prior to the third year of the Project when the Government is required to limit public&#13;
spending exclusively to the drugs on the Essential Drugs List.&#13;
Net Consumption of Medicines&#13;
6.31   Since the drugs are to be sold, either for cash or for reimbursement from Article 10 funds, the&#13;
net increase in total consumption of medicines will depend, on the-one-hand, on the budgetary resources&#13;
available to purchase medicines, and, on the-other-hand, on the financial ability of consumers to incur&#13;
out-of-pocket expenses. The increase in supply of cheaply procured drugs at the distributor levels may,&#13;
however, lead to a decline in scarcity premia inflating drug retail prices. Net consumption is likely to&#13;
increase by a modest amount. As the Project will institute mechanisms to ensure that drugs procured&#13;
under the Project are distributed to all oblast Pharmacias, the increase in net consumption is expected to&#13;
be spread across the country.&#13;
Distribuion System&#13;
6.32   The component will assist in the re-capitalization of the weakest link in the pharmaceuticals&#13;
distribution system in the Republic: the oblast Pharmacias. These Pharmacias, nominally independent,&#13;
are deeply in debt, have no access to short-term credit, and have meager inventories. By providing these&#13;
regional distributors with a substantial supply of low-cost drugs, and if the Pharmacias are permitted to&#13;
retain a significant portion of their earnings from onward sale of the medicines, it is possible that one or&#13;
more of the distributors will be able to emerge as financially viable. Financially sound distributors which&#13;
may be able to compete with each other in the future, will help sustain improved availability of medicines&#13;
well beyond the duration of the Project.&#13;
Effective Regulation of Medicines&#13;
6.33   The component will provide financing critical to strengthen institutional capacity to assure the&#13;
safety and efficacy of medicines produced and/or distributed locally. Empowered regulatory bodies will&#13;
be better placed to enforce procurement guidelines and contribute to educating practitioners and users in&#13;
the use of essential drugs. Successful implementation of regulatory capacity building under the Project&#13;
is likely to be an effective means of sustaining the benefits from cost-effective procurement, distribution&#13;
and use of medicines in the country during and beyond the Project.&#13;
C. Risks and Limitations&#13;
6.34   The reforms proposed under the Project target some of the structures in the health sector which&#13;
are most difficult to change in an orderly manner. The aim is to restructure resource flows in the sector&#13;
and this necessarily implies that there are winners and losers.&#13;
Closure and Retrenchment&#13;
6.35   The potential efficiency gains identified from reforms cannot be achieved without rationalization&#13;
of inpatient facilities and staff. The issue of closure of facilities and staff retrenchment is an enormously&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
difficult one which many countries are grappling with in health and other sectors. Resistance to&#13;
rationalization efforts can be expected not only from medical professionals and auxiliary staff fearing job&#13;
losses, but users in catchment areas of facilities which are likely to be closed. Uncertainty and anxiety&#13;
in this regard may lead to resistance to the adoption of new ambulatory protocols and payment methods&#13;
even if closure is not an explicit program in the short-term. The Government would need assistance to&#13;
undertake a process of consultation with different constituencies such as doctors, other medical staff, users&#13;
in urban and rural areas, MOH staff, the Parliament, etc. to develop a program, design a compensation&#13;
package, identify re-training opportunities, disseminate information on the need, purpose and measures&#13;
necessary and generally build a core consensus on the issues.&#13;
6.36   The strengthening of primary and ambulatory service delivery is a precursor to inpatient capacity&#13;
reduction. The Project has focussed on this first process through the already complex set of proposed&#13;
reforms. While recognizing the necessity of assisting the Government with a capacity rationalization&#13;
strategy, the project preparation team did not think it feasible to include a facility and staff rationalization&#13;
program within the Project itself, especially given limited implementation capacity and reduced central&#13;
staffing levels in the MOH. Efforts have been made to coordinate project planning with relevant efforts&#13;
being undertaken through other programs. A facility restructuring program currently being developed&#13;
by the ODA will identify a detailed facility rationalization plan for Bishkek City, including the financing&#13;
needs. The MANAS group is also developing a master plan for facility rationalization. It is not clear&#13;
whether these efforts, combined with the urgency created by the continuing fiscal crisis, will be enough&#13;
to build the political will in Government necessary to undertake physical and human resource&#13;
rationalization. As results unfold, it will become clearer whether the issue will remain a priority for&#13;
support under the next Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL).&#13;
Potential for Private Sector Displacement&#13;
6.37   In a real sense, there is little displacement likely from the large majority of interventions proposed&#13;
under the Project since the private sector is very small at the moment. Moreover, the primary health&#13;
interventions to be financed under the Project are mostly of a public goods type, with significant gains&#13;
to society (e.g. TB, STDs, CDD, ARI, adult/family health education). These are appropriate areas for&#13;
public financing since a potentially active private financing sector may not find these areas attractive and&#13;
may finance these services at levels below those which would benefit society at large.&#13;
6.38   An area where there is an unknown net impact on the private sector, is that of current&#13;
pharmaceuticals procurement under the Pharmaceutical Management component. Since the oblast&#13;
Pharmacias will be receiving drugs at a low cost, it may become more difficult for other distributors to&#13;
sell the same drugs profitably, i.e. at a price high enough to cover their acquisition costs. It is possible&#13;
that alternative sourcing of the drugs procured under the Project could decline, especially if quantities&#13;
procured under the Project represent a substantial portion of annual demand for the medicine. The&#13;
magnitude of this effect is impossible to predict at the moment because of the lack of information on the&#13;
composition of current drug consumption, the recent nature of private distributor activity in the country,&#13;
etc. In order to minimize any displacement effect, it will be necessary to carefully choose the list of&#13;
drugs to be procured under the Project and to spread out disbursement in simple tranches.&#13;
6.39   On the other hand, the Project may facilitate the growth of the private sector. The Project&#13;
finances a large amount of training in modern clinical and management techniques which can be used by&#13;
private providers of health care. Changes in provider payment systems promoted by the Project can be&#13;
utilized to compensate private providers as well as public sector providers. Under the pharmaceuticals&#13;
management component, the structure of on-lending is designed to re-capitalize distributors who may be&#13;
able to compete on a financially viable basis in future procurement and distribution activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;
Fiscal Sustainability&#13;
6.40   No significant new incremental costs are expected under the Project and the counterpart financing&#13;
required from the Government over the course of the Project is estimated as averaging annually at I %&#13;
of the 1994 budgetary expenditures on health. Of greater concern for the overall feasibility of the&#13;
Project, however, is the level of budgetary commitment expected for the health sector for the duration&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
6.41   Several aspects of the Project require that health sector budgetary expenditures be maintained at&#13;
the real levels of health budget execution of 1994.&#13;
(i)    As an example, in order to compensate providers under the new payment methods,&#13;
adequate public resources will be necessary in the Health Fund such that realistic&#13;
capitation compensation rates and hospital global budgets can be set. If public financing&#13;
declines beyond current levels, the financial viability and credibility of the new payment&#13;
system will be severely undernined.&#13;
(ii)    Further, the above analysis demonstrates that the increased volume of utilization of&#13;
outpatient facilities expected from the reforms will imply capital needs to finance&#13;
conversion to and rehabilitation of outpatient facilities.  This provides one of the&#13;
arguments for the proposed Covenant requiring Government to maintain public health&#13;
budgets at a reasonable level: even if savings are expected and realized through closure&#13;
of inpatient facilities, there would be considerable need to re-invest savings in upgrading&#13;
and expanding outpatient capacity in order to accommodate the desired changes in&#13;
utilization patterns.&#13;
(iii)   The public health system's access to the drugs procured under the pharmaceuticals&#13;
management component (but not the PHC component) is circumscribed by the total public&#13;
funds available in central and oblast budgets to purchase these drugs directly or through&#13;
reimbursement of exempted consumption.&#13;
6.42   As documented in Part 1, real expenditure levels in the Kyrgyz health sector have already declined&#13;
significantly during the course of transition, jeopardizing both effective coverage and quality of services&#13;
provided. In view of these earlier declines, and of the need to re-invest any savings generated by the&#13;
Project towards sustaining the reform process, it was the judgement of the project appraisal team that&#13;
further declines in health spending could delay, or effectively negate, the improvements in utilization and&#13;
health status expected from the reforms. These concerns have been discussed with the Government and&#13;
a covenant will be included to require that the level of total executed budgetary financing of the health&#13;
sector is not less than the 1994 executed level in real inflation adjusted terms (using IMF estimates of&#13;
GDP deflators) for the project implementation period.&#13;
6.43   Additional sources of financing of health services are also being explored. The USAID is&#13;
exploring the feasibility of a payroll tax based mandatory health insurance system through its existing&#13;
technical assistance program in Issyk-kul Oblast. Given the ongoing revenue shortfalls faced by the&#13;
Government, the likelihood of any additional financing being raised through payroll taxes seems unlikely&#13;
in the short-term. User fees for services, while already in operation for some types of services is not&#13;
extensive. The MANAS Group is discussing the introduction of a minimum package of cost-effective&#13;
services which would be provided free of charge and beyond which user fees could be introduced for the&#13;
non-poor. Given the extensive prevalence of poverty in the country and the likely administrative costs&#13;
of administering a fee system, net revenue expected if fees are introduced are likely to be modest at best.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
It was also judged that revision of the exemptions policy for consumption of medicines is neither&#13;
politically nor administratively feasible in the short term, and again, may not generate significant savings&#13;
if implemented. Adherence to the covenant will thus require clear Government commnitment and inter-&#13;
sectoral adjustments within total public sector spending.&#13;
6.44   As has been demonstrated, if real budgetary levels are maintained, potential savings are realized&#13;
through facility rationalization, and realized savings are re-invested in primary care, the delivery of health&#13;
care in the Republic will be on a far more financially sustainable and cost-effective basis than it is at&#13;
present.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Mr. Johannes Linn&#13;
Dear Mr. Linn:&#13;
I am pleased to present to the Board of Directors of the International Development Association&#13;
for its consideration a Statement by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic regarding its Policy toward&#13;
the future development of health care services in our country. This Policy Statement is an accurate and&#13;
concise distillation of the comprehensive strategy and detailed plan for health care reform that has been&#13;
developed under the MANAS program. The MANAS program, as you know, is the result of more than&#13;
two years' intense, collaborative work between the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the World&#13;
Health Organization, and other donors, and it commands the full support of the Ministry of Health. In&#13;
the very near future, this program will be presented to the Government for its review and endorsement,&#13;
after which it will be published. I relate these details in order to emphasize that the attached Policy&#13;
Statement is indeed a very carefully considered and true expression of our plans and intentions.&#13;
During preparation of the project to be financed under the proposed Credit from the Association,&#13;
a number of questions were raised in connection with the Government's policy. In this context, I wish&#13;
to take this opportunity to address these questions and to assure you that my Government is fully&#13;
committed to taking the following steps which, I believe, you will find reflected in the attached Policy&#13;
Statement:&#13;
(1)    during execution of the Project, the level of annual, consolidated state budgetary&#13;
expenditures implemented in the health sector will not be less than the level of such expenditures&#13;
implemented in 1994, taking into account adjustments for inflation, and savings resulting from&#13;
implementation of the Project will be re-invested in the health sector;&#13;
(2)    during execution of the Project, activities aimed at rationalizing and modernizing the&#13;
health sector will be continued, including gradual merging of specialized departments and health facilities,&#13;
an increase in the amount of resources allocated to primary and ambulatory care, and a reduction in&#13;
numbers of beds, staff, and other resources consumed in hospitals;&#13;
(3)    as part of this restructuring, the following specific actions will be taken: a) programs for&#13;
the treatment of AIDS and other STDs will be combined with other primary care treatment programs,&#13;
and new methods and protocols of treatrnent will be introduced in order to permit expanded ambulatory&#13;
treatment of STDs; b) results of pilot projects demonstrating the effectiveness of ambulatory treatment&#13;
of tuberculosis will be fully taken into account and reflected in the development of national standards for&#13;
treatment of TB and specialists and other staff will be re-allocated from in-patient TB facilities to primary&#13;
health care centers and specialized TB sanatoria will be gradually closed; c) capital expenditures will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                               ANNEX 1&#13;
concentrated, to the maximum extent possible, on the rehabilitation of existing health care facilities, and&#13;
capital expenditures will be made available for new construction of only general hospitals and other health&#13;
facilities that provide a broad range of services; d) during execution of the Project, the level of annual,&#13;
consolidated state budgetary expenditures allocated to the maintenance and repair of health care facilities&#13;
will not be less than the level of such expenditures implemented in 1994, taking into account adjustments&#13;
for inflation;&#13;
(4)    individuals and families will be allowed full freedom to choose from which health service&#13;
providers and physicians to receive treatment, and this freedom will be assured and protected;&#13;
(5)    a national policy concerning pharmaceuticals will be implemented, including: a) adoption&#13;
of all necessary legal, organizational and financial measures in order to ensure that only drugs which are&#13;
safe and of proven effectiveness will be available for use in the Republic; b) implementation of an&#13;
Essential Drugs Program; (c) starting from the third year of the Project, allocation of state budgetary&#13;
resources for the procurement, distribution, or provision of only pharmaceuticals which are contained on&#13;
the Republic's Essential Drugs List; d) continued elimination of obstacles impeding the establishment and&#13;
financial success of privately-owned pharmacies, distributors of pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical&#13;
manufacturers.&#13;
During negotiations of the Credit Agreement, held recently in Washington, another key question&#13;
was raised in connection with the Government's Policy, and I would like to take this opportunity to&#13;
clarify this as well.&#13;
The rationalization and modernization of the health care sector, and the allocation of increased&#13;
resources to support ambulatory methods of treatment, will necessitate the redeployment of a significant&#13;
number of specialists and other health care personnel. This will be a very complicated and at times&#13;
painful process and will have to be conducted with utmost care and concern for the people involved.&#13;
Considerable re-training will be required, some of which is envisioned to take place under the Project.&#13;
I wish to assure you, however, that the first priority of the Government is to improve the health of the&#13;
people of our Republic, and that we will not hesitate to take even painful steps if necessary in order to&#13;
achieve this goal.&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;
By Is/ A. Djumagulov&#13;
Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 2.A: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE - WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    There are one million women of reproductive age in the Kyrgyz Republic and, in 1993, just over&#13;
120,000 live births. This sub-component is designed to reach these women and impact upon their health&#13;
status and that of their newborns.&#13;
2.    Maternal, perinatal and reproductive health activities are implemented through the Maternal and&#13;
Child Health Department at the Ministry of Health (MOH). This department has shrunk from eight&#13;
positions to five positions in the last couple of years. There are plans to merge this department into the&#13;
Prevention and Treatment Department at the MOH, and thereby reduce staff positions even further. At&#13;
the regional level there is a Chief Pediatrician and a Chief Obstetrician for each of the 6 Oblast Health&#13;
Administrations and also for Bishkek City Health Department. There is one Medical Institute for training&#13;
medical students; 10 medical colleges for training paramedics; and a Department of Continuous Medical&#13;
Education for refresher training of doctors and paramedics. The Republican Institute for Obstetrics,&#13;
Gynecology and Pediatrics acts as a tertiary referral hospital and research center, and trains post-diploma&#13;
specialists.&#13;
3.    The Kyrgyz Republic has an extensive health service infrastructure from the district (Raion), to&#13;
the regional (Oblast) and Republican levels. The existing organizational structures in the health system&#13;
hamper the provision of optimnal care. For instance, the current system of urban health services is highly&#13;
specialized and fragmented. For gynecological problems and pregnancy a women must visit a women's&#13;
consultation center; for contraception and infertility, a marriage and family center; and for AIDS testing,&#13;
an AIDS center. Similarly, the separation of diagnosis of STDs in women's consultations from their&#13;
treatment in venerology clinics lessens the likelihood that women and their partners will in fact be treated.&#13;
Separating delivery in the maternity home from the provision of acute neonatal care in the children's&#13;
hospitals inhibits prompt treatment of sick babies. There is also a wastage of limited resources through&#13;
the duplication of services: for example normal maternal patients and "pathological" maternal patients are&#13;
treated in separate hospital departments with separate labor, delivery, surgical and post-delivery facilities.&#13;
Premature and sick and full-term babies are also kept in different departments.  Some of these&#13;
shortcomings are identified by the WHO/World Bank consultant Prof. H. Ramic in his report "Maternal&#13;
and Perinatal Health in the Kyrgyz Republic, June 1995 ". One of the aims of the Primary Health Care&#13;
Component is to merge specialist facilities and integrate their services at the primary health care level,&#13;
thereby streamlining the referral system and reducing the need for separate specialized hospitals,&#13;
departments and clinics.&#13;
Maternal Mortality Rates per 100,000 live births (MOH data)&#13;
1990             1991              1992              1993             1994&#13;
81.4             76.4              70.1             80.1              80.1&#13;
4.    The maternal mortality rate (MMR) at 80.1 per 100,000 live births, is far higher than that of&#13;
Russia (51), Ukraine (32), Costa Rica (20) or the European Union (10), despite the fact that over 95%&#13;
of births occur in hospitals and prenatal health care is widely available. The MMR remained stable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                              ANNEX 2.A&#13;
between 1993 and 1994 at 80.1 per 100,000 live births having risen from a 1992 rate of 70. 1. The WHO&#13;
definition of maternal mortality and live births has not been adopted as yet and the true MMR may well&#13;
be 30% to 50% higher than the official Government rates. Birth intervals are short, only one year in&#13;
22% of women. Almost 10% of births are to women less than 19 years of age. The birth rate is&#13;
dropping in the current difficult socioeconomic conditions. Almost 75% of all maternal deaths are in&#13;
rural areas. Inter-oblast variation in maternal death rates can be quite substantial. Over the period 1992-&#13;
1993, in those oblast where the Ministry of Health made a concerted effort to supply drugs and train&#13;
primary health care workers, they were able to reduce the maternal death rates considerably. The&#13;
shortage of resources, constrained the Ministry of Health's ability to extend this support to all oblasts.&#13;
This sub-component aims to rectify this.&#13;
5.     The perinatal mortality in 1991 was 26 per 1000 births and is moderately high for a country with&#13;
universal coverage of maternal and child health services. It has however been dropping slightly since&#13;
1991. but the actual contribution of perinatal mortality to the infant mortality rate has been increasing;&#13;
from 25% in 1994 to 29% in 1995. The main cause of perinatal death are in descending order:&#13;
respiratory distress syndrome, birth hypoxia/asphyxia, intracranial birth trauma, and sepsis. The rate of&#13;
low birth weight in the Kyrgyz Republic is below 6 %, quite a low level even in developed countries, but&#13;
the birth weight specific mortality rates are somewhat high. Most of the problem lies in the survival of&#13;
newborns with 2,500 grams of birth weight or more. This is likely to be due to the quality of perinatal&#13;
medical care. The Kyrgyz Republic could probably reduce substantially this current level of perinatal&#13;
mortality if greater survival could be achieved for the heavier babies. The low rates of Caesarean section&#13;
(of which two thirds are emergency and only one third elective) and assisted deliveries could explain to&#13;
a large extent the high rates of mortality among the heavier babies.&#13;
6.    A comprehensive approach to the inpatient management of pregnant women, her labor and&#13;
delivery, and the care of her newborn infant has been shown to decrease mortality in other countries.&#13;
Cooperative efforts between obstetricians and pediatricians is essential to this success. Regionalization&#13;
of perinatal care consists of treating low risk pregnant women and newborns in raion centers and referring&#13;
high risk women, sick and/or premature infants to perinatal centers. The current list of risk factors for&#13;
pregnant women is too stringent and leads to the inclusion of almost 80% of women in the at risk&#13;
category, leading to unacceptably high referral rates to higher levels of care. As a result, minor problems&#13;
are overstated and serious ones may be overlooked. Given the difficult conditions for women in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic approximately 20-25 % of pregnant women can be expected to be at risk of morbidity&#13;
during pregnancy and childbirth. Internationally, the risk group is usually 10% or less. New protocols&#13;
will be introduced to rationalize this screening of pregnant women into high risk groups, thereby shifting&#13;
limited resources to the serious cases who need them the most.&#13;
7.    Deaths from eclarnpsia, hemorrhage and sepsis, the leading causes of maternal death in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic, can all be prevented using a range of cost-effective interventions at the primary health&#13;
care level. A third of maternal deaths are due to eclampsia (high blood pressure and swelling leading&#13;
to fits and coma) and these eclamptic deaths have increased in proportion to the other main causes,&#13;
hemorrhage and sepsis, over the last few years. This increase is thought to be due to lack of training and&#13;
basic equipment in prenatal care at the primary health care level coupled with a shortage of transport.&#13;
Abortion is also a leading cause of maternal deaths. Abortion rates are very high, with an average of&#13;
2.3 to 2.7 abortions per woman. Although reliable data on contraceptive prevalence is lacking, it would&#13;
appear that there is a large unmet need for contraceptives. Abortion remains the primary means of&#13;
fertility control. There is a particular need for contraceptive counselling in the postnatal period and after&#13;
an abortion. High rates of anemia in Kyrgyz women, about 30% of pregnant women, have consequences&#13;
for both the mother and her unborn child. Severe anemia in the mother will limit blood supply to the&#13;
fetus, increasing the risk of newborn asphyxia/hypoxia. In the event of hemorrhage during delivery,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73                              ANNEX 2.A&#13;
anemia greatly increases the likelihood of the women suffering from shock or death. As a result, routine&#13;
iron folate and multivitamin supplementation will be introduced for pregnant women.&#13;
8.    In general, hospital practices during delivery are fairly comparable to European practices, but&#13;
there are several major shortcomings which must be corrected: first and second stage of labor should be&#13;
limited in time; the use of forceps and vacuum extractors should be encouraged; the indications for&#13;
Caesarean section must be revised; the fetus should be monitored regularly; the prevention and&#13;
management of postpartum hemorrhage must be improved. This sub-component aims to upgrade the&#13;
obstetric skills of obstetricians and midwives to improve their monitoring of labor and their clinical&#13;
judgement on when and how to intervene with an intervention (labor induction, augmentation, vacuum&#13;
extraction, Caesarean section, etc.). Breastfeeding will also be encouraged in this sub-component, in&#13;
collaboration with UNICEF who plan to establish a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, through the&#13;
development of a supportive environment in maternity homes (rooming-in, early mother-baby contact,&#13;
on-demand feeding, presence of family members, etc.).&#13;
9.     The current system does not sufficiently emphasize health education as part of prenatal care, nor&#13;
do sufficient educational and promotional materials exist. There is also a low level of knowledge of the&#13;
needs of pregnant women among the general population. In a country, such as the Kyrgyz Republic, with&#13;
very high literacy levels in males and females, this should not be the case. Information, education and&#13;
communications are essential to improve knowledge of family planning, nutrition and maternity care,&#13;
including recognition of danger signs of complications of pregnancy, among women, family members,&#13;
community leaders and health care providers. To rectify these shortcomings in the health system, this&#13;
subcomponent will focus on teaching counselling techniques to health workers; and will fund the&#13;
development, printing and distribution of a health education booklet for the general public.&#13;
10.   The epidemiological picture for syphilis and gonorrhea has fallen somewhere between the pattern&#13;
seen in developing countries; that is epidemic levels of diseases, and the picture seen in industrialized&#13;
countries; that is low and still falling rates of infection confined to high risk groups. Since 1993, there&#13;
has been a ten fold increase in the incidence of syphilis. This dramatic increase reflects a trend reported&#13;
in many other republics of the former Soviet Union. At the same time detection rates for gonorrhea have&#13;
declined after remaining at a stable level over the last two decades. This data suggests that the level of&#13;
unsafe sexual activity in the Kyrgyz Republic is increasing and less STD cases are seeking treatment in&#13;
the government health system. Little information is available on the incidence of chlamydia. Up until&#13;
1995, HIV had not been detected in the resident population despite a massive screening program. STD&#13;
and AIDS are managed through two separate vertical organizational structures that merge at the district&#13;
level. Access to STD treatment is limited to a few specialized dermatovenereal clinics in which people&#13;
must registers their names in order to obtain free treatment. The result is that most STD cases either treat&#13;
themselves or seek anonymous care from non-accredited private doctors. Adolescents are particularly&#13;
vulnerable because of their lack of money and information. More detailed information is available in the&#13;
World Bank report "Assessment of the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Program in the Kyrgyz Republic:&#13;
October 1994". One aim of this sub-component is to encourage the anonymous ambulatory management&#13;
of patients with syphilis and gonorrhea and the integration of venerology services into the primary health&#13;
care level.&#13;
11.   In sumnmary, the health infrastructure is extensive, women are educated and relatively mobile.&#13;
Family planning is still not readily available to the majority of women, but with donor assistance the&#13;
range of services are expanding. Safe abortion is offered through the government health system.&#13;
Maternal services are available at primary health care facilities, but are under-utilized. Delivery&#13;
attendants are trained, the vast majority of deliveries take place in hospital, but the clinical practices need&#13;
upgrading and a regular supply of essential drugs, supplies and equipment must be established. IEC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
capability is available but under-utilized. Improving the quality and efficiency of health care, including&#13;
decentralizing services, as well as developing a more comprehensive strategy for women's health, and&#13;
improving information, education and commnunication; will all be priority interventions in this sub-&#13;
component.&#13;
B. Role of Other Donors&#13;
12.   The German Government's KFW is supplying clinical equipment to all FAPS, SVAs and Central&#13;
Raion Hospitals in the Kyrgyz Republic. GTZ will fund a technical advisor to the Republican Health&#13;
Center to improve national health education and health promotion activities. USAID's Women's&#13;
Reproductive Health Program has been focusing on strengthening family planning services and&#13;
contraceptive supply. This extensive program has a number of contractors (Association for Voluntary&#13;
Surgical Contraception, JHPIEGO, The Futures Group, Population Communications Services)&#13;
implementing activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. UNFPA is supplying contraceptives, plans to establish&#13;
a regional office for Central Asia, and has a local country program officer in Bishkek. The Center for&#13;
Diseases Control, funded by USAID, and has an office with two regional advisors in Almaty and is&#13;
working on surveillance and computer training. UNICEF has a country office in Bishkek and plans to&#13;
develop a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. The WHO/Euro and TICA supported MANAS Health Sector&#13;
Reform Project for the Kygryz Republic developed a national health reform masterplan in 1995, and will&#13;
assist with implementation of the masterplan in 1996. The WHO/Euro CAREC program will introduce&#13;
maternal and child health pilot sites and a sentinel surveillance system in two raions in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic (and five other Central Asian countries). WHO has a Central Asia regional advisor on AIDS&#13;
based in Almaty who could work closely on the integration of the STD/AIDS structures. There is a&#13;
WHO Information Center for Central Asia, in Bishkek, with a well stocked library of WHO materials&#13;
both in Russian and English. AIHA (American International Health Alliance) is working in various parts&#13;
of the former Soviet Union, and has conducted training courses on inmnediate neonatal resuscitation,&#13;
based on training courses developed by the American Pediatrics Association. Central Asian Partners, a&#13;
small NGO based in Bishkek, is working on the upgrading of obstetric skills in several health facilities.&#13;
13.   This sub-component complements the work of other donors (UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO CAREC&#13;
program, German Government KFW and GTZ, Central Asian Partners, BASICS, etc.).&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
14.   This sub-component makes up for a major deficit in the assistance being provided by other donors&#13;
to priority health programs; namely a comprehensive safe motherhood and perinatal health intervention&#13;
for implementation nationwide. Many donors are providing small scale activities in a few selected health&#13;
facilities. USAID and UNFPA have focused on a specific element of safe motherhood; contraceptive&#13;
supply and family planning activities. This sub-component will focus on all the other components:&#13;
maternal health, perinatal health, and sexually transmitted diseases case management; and integrate them&#13;
with the family planning activities. The aim of this sub-component is to reduce the heavy burden of&#13;
maternal and perinatal deaths and ensure the long-term sustainability of a comprehensive maternal and&#13;
perinatal health program within the government health structure through a process of rationalization and&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
D. Women's Reproductive Health Sub-Component Description&#13;
15.   This sub-component will fund 5 months of technical assistance; a study tour; computers; training&#13;
equipment; clinical equipment for 206 health facilities- translation and printing of health worker training&#13;
materials; essential drugs for model Oblast training centers and 12 Raion hospitals, nationwide training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
of up to 2000 obstetricians, gynecologists, venereologist, neonatologists, pediatricians, and primary health&#13;
care workers.&#13;
16.   The long term goals of the Women's Reproductive Health sub-component are the:&#13;
(i)    Reduction of maternal deaths due to obstetric complications such as hemorrhage,&#13;

Raion Hospitals.&#13;
(iv)   Improved Public Awareness:&#13;
(a)    Booklets on family health for the general public distributed free of charge from&#13;
primary health care facilities.&#13;
19.   Five months of international technical assistance will be required over the four and a half years&#13;
of the project: 2.5 months in Year 1, 1.5 months in Year 2, and 2 weeks in Year 3 and Year 4 (see&#13;
attached terms of reference in Table 3). The technical assistance will be required to conduct training&#13;
courses, organize and conduct the study tour, assist in the development of booklets for the general public.&#13;
Local technical assistance will be required for computer software training.&#13;
20.    The following range of foreign specialist skills will be required to undertake these activities:&#13;
(i)    Women's and Children's Health Program management specialist;&#13;
(ii)    Obstetrician/gynecologist with experience in teaching the WHO "Mother-Baby Package"&#13;
Guidelines;&#13;
(iii)   Neonatologist/pediatrician with experience in teaching the WHO "Mother-Baby Package"&#13;
Guidelines;&#13;
(iv)   Venereologist with experience in teaching the WHO Standard Guidelines on Sexually&#13;
Transmitted Diseases.&#13;
21.   The activities of the sub-component are described in greater detail below:&#13;
(i)    Strengthen Program Management:&#13;
22.   Develop a national policy: The various Republican level institutions involved in maternal and&#13;
child health will be encouraged to coordinate activities with the MOH and Oblast Health Administrations&#13;
through the formation of a national task force: Kyrgyz State Medical Institute, Faculty of Continuous&#13;
Medical Education, Republican Paramedic Medical College, the Republican Institute for Obstetrics,&#13;
Gynecology and Pediatrics, Republican Maternity Hospital, the Republican Marriage and Family Center,&#13;
the Republican Dermatovenereal Dispensary, and the Republican AIDS Center. A national policy and&#13;
planning workshop is scheduled to prepare the policies and plans of action to define national objectives,&#13;
establish targets and subtargets for the major activities: training, supervision, logistics, commnunication,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The task force will develop a national policy on safe motherhood and&#13;
perinatal health which will include the rationalization of services and integration into the primary health&#13;
care level. Special attention will be paid to programs for marginal groups, including adolescents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
23.   The WHO definitions for health indicators will have to be adopted and medical audit and quality&#13;
assurance procedures put into place. A new system of supervision will replace the old style punitive&#13;
approach based upon the use of orders and decrees, which have largely ossified in time. Existing&#13;
maternal and child health management information systems will be improved through a rationalization&#13;
of all reporting (introduce new home-based mothers records, tally sheets, referral letters, report forms,&#13;
etc.). The registration of newborns should be improved with direct referral of the newborn card to the&#13;
registration office with minimal costs to the parents. Linkages between the different levels of health&#13;
facilities needs to be improved. Service provision by the private sector and non-government organizations&#13;
must be encouraged for cost saving purposes, and these new services coordinated and integrated into the&#13;
general referral system. A basic package of essential services for pregnant women and newborns to be&#13;
funded and provided by the government health system will have to be negotiated.&#13;
24.   A small baseline health facility survey will aim to establish baseline data in maternal and perinatal&#13;
health practices against which improvements in the standard management and clinical can later be&#13;
measured. This survey will be undertaken by the MOH and Oblast program managers as part of the&#13;
policy and planning workshop. The survey coupled with a focused program review (FPR) will then be&#13;
repeated mid-project and at the end of the project. The results of this health facility survey, which is&#13;
really an internal phased evaluation mechanism for the program managers, will allow them to "tailor"&#13;
the national maternal and perinatal care program, monitoring progress and identifying priority areas which&#13;
will require special attention at different points in the project.&#13;
25.   Improve maternal and perinatal program management at the MOH and Oblast Health&#13;
Administration levels: Special emphasis will be placed on strengthening the MOH Central, Oblast and&#13;
Raion management to ensure adequate surveillance, supervision and monitoring of the programs. A range&#13;
of workshops and on-the-job training will be conducted for MOH and Oblast Health Administration&#13;
program managers and other key people (management training, computer software training, national&#13;
policy development workshop, regular program review workshops). The sub-component will provide&#13;
equipment for the Chief Obstetrician at the Ministry of Health to strengthen surveillance, training,&#13;
supervision and management (computer, printer &amp; software training).&#13;
26.   The MOH has been compiling the essential drug list and will be responsible for maintaining and&#13;
regularly updating a database on rational drug prescribing and the WHO case management protocols.&#13;
The MOH Chief Obstetrician and Chief Pediatrician will be trained to allocate their time more efficiently&#13;
by refocusing their work to policy development and monitoring. However, the major work must be&#13;
largely decentralized to the Oblast Health Administration.&#13;
27.   A study tour will be arranged in the first year of the project for 10 people over a two week&#13;
period. Participants will include maternal and child health program managers from the Ministry of Health&#13;
and Oblast Health Administrations (Chief Pediatricians and Chief Obstetricians), and national specialists&#13;
in obstetrics, neonatology and venereology. The group will travel with one facilitator and one interpreter.&#13;
The objective of the study tour is to observe cost-effective and comprehensive National Maternal and&#13;
Perinatal Health programs (following WHO guidelines both in program management and clinical case&#13;
management with integration of services at the primary health care level) in other countries. The study&#13;
tour participants should visit the following:&#13;
(i)    Ministry of Health to discuss the National MPH program with MOH program managers&#13;
(ii)   Regional Health Departments to discuss the Regional MPH programs with Regional&#13;
program managers&#13;
(iii)   Hospital maternity, pediatric and venereology departments providing shared care with the&#13;
primary health care levels.&#13;
&#13;

(iv)   Primary health care clinics with integrated services&#13;
(v)    Community based services&#13;
(ii)    Upgrade Health Provider Skills:&#13;
28.   The health worker training will be implemented in three phases as shown in the table below:&#13;
Phase 1. Training of National and Oblast Trainers&#13;
Phase 2. Training of Oblast Hospital and Central Raion Hospital staff and trainers&#13;
Phase 3. Training of Primary Health Care Teams&#13;
29.    This will require the following workshops:&#13;
(i)    Practical intensive "hands-on" training of hospital specialist trainers (obstetricians,&#13;
neonatologists, venereologist);&#13;
(ii)    Training of trainers workshop for National trainers;&#13;
(iii)   Training of trainers workshop for Oblast trainers;&#13;
(iv)   6 Oblast Model Hospital staff training workshops (one per Oblast);&#13;
(v)    Workshop for staff from 43 Central Raion Hospitals;&#13;
(vi)   Workshop for staff from 170 SVAS;&#13;
(vii)   Workshop for staff from 870 FAPS.&#13;
30.   A more detailed breakdown of the training is shown in the training timetable. A core national&#13;
and oblast team of trainers (14 obstetricians, 14 neonatologists, 14 midwives) and a total of 2000 health&#13;
workers will be trained in Phases 1, 2 and 3.&#13;

31.   Develop a training package: National policies will be developed with a well defined basic health&#13;
care package for pregnant women and their infants to be funded and provided by the government health&#13;
system. These policies; together with the adapted WHO Mother-Baby Package; will be used as the basis&#13;
for the technical guidelines on maternal and perinatal health care and the case management of sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases. The following WHO training modules adapted from the "WHO Mother-Baby&#13;
Package" to the special health needs of the Kyrgyz Republic will be taught to hospital specialists and&#13;
primary health care workers:&#13;
(i)    Medical and nursing care of normal and high risk pregnancies.&#13;
(ii)    Medical and nursing care of normal and high risk deliveries (including partograms).&#13;
(iii)   Medical and nursing care of newborns (including resuscitation).&#13;
(iv)   Breastfeeding during the neonatal and perinatal period.&#13;
(v)    Principles and practice of family planning.&#13;
(vi)   Sexually transmitted diseases case management.&#13;
(vii)  Prenatal and postnatal counseling techniques&#13;
32.   Other WHO training modules could include:&#13;
(i)    Care of the mother and baby at a health center WHO/FHE/MSM/94.2E&#13;
(ii)    Detecting pre-eclampsia WHO/MCH/MSM/92.3E&#13;

33.   The policy and guidelines will be developed in Russian by a committee of national experts, with&#13;
the assistance of a team of international technical advisors during the project preparation phase (funded&#13;
by PPF). The guidelines will cover two major areas of the program activities: one - upgraded hospital&#13;
practices in prenatal care, delivery care (including partograms to monitor labor; augmented labor; and&#13;
assisted delivery techniques such as vacuum extraction, forceps) and newborn resuscitation and&#13;
management of sexually transmitted diseases; and two - upgraded primary health care practices in&#13;
maternal health, perinatal health and sexually transmitted diseases management. Guidelines with clinical&#13;
management and criteria for referral will be developed for four different levels of health facilities:&#13;
Level 1.     Specialist tertiary and Oblast Hospitals&#13;
Level 2.     Central Raion Hospitals&#13;
Level 3.     Polyclinics, SVAs and APTKS.&#13;
Level 4.     Feldsher/Accoucheur Posts&#13;
34.   The guidelines will be printed early in the project to coincide with the start of training activities.&#13;
All health workers trained will be provided with case management charts and other materials adapted&#13;
from the original WHO management charts, as work aids for effective case management.&#13;
35.   Strengthen and decentralize training sites: An objective of this sub-component is to increase&#13;
training capacity within the country through a process of institution strengthening and decentralization&#13;
to implement these guidelines in a sustainable way. The quality of practical training will be improved&#13;
through a focus on intensive "hands-on" training in a clinical setting with real patients. The training will&#13;
take place at the two already established Centers of Continuous Medical Education in Bishkek and Osh&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
(both faculties of the Medical Institute)-, and the model health facilities (one multispecialty hospital, onie&#13;
multispecialty polyclinic, and one FAP) to be developed during the project in each of the 6 Oblasts.&#13;
36.   The Center of Continuous Medical Education (CCME), in Bishkek City, will act as the focus for&#13;
all training activities in Phase I of the project and will be responsible for training coordination nationwide.&#13;
The CCME has a sub-department in Osh City, and this sub-department will play a training and&#13;
coordinating role for the south Kyrgyz Republic. The following set of office and training equipment will&#13;
be provided under the Primary Health Care Component for each of these CCMES: one computer, one&#13;
printer &amp; software (plus training), one heavy duty photocopier, one fax machine, one television, one&#13;
VCR, one slide projector, one overhead projector and screen; I flipchart stand and a set of training&#13;
physiological models (women's pelvis to practice assisted delivery; and newborn baby to practice newborn&#13;
resuscitation).&#13;
37.   Train a core of National and Oblast trainers in adapted WHO "Mother-Baby Package": In&#13;
Phase 1. of the training program the National and Oblast Trainers will receive training at the CCME in&#13;
Bishkek City and the Republican hospitals. These trainers will be selected from medical and paramedical&#13;
colleges and the Republican Postgraduate Institutes. Intensive in-hospital training of these national and&#13;
oblast hospital specialists by foreign experts in obstetrics, neonatology and venereology will be required&#13;
in the initial phase of the project; followed by a training of trainers course.&#13;
38.   Train health providers in adapted WHO "Mother-Baby Package" at Republican, Oblast and&#13;
Raion levels: In Phase 2 the Oblast model hospitals will be trained and they will then be responsible for&#13;
training Central Raion Hospital staff. Local part-time training coordinators will be funded by the project&#13;
to work in each of the 6 Oblast model hospitals. The practical "hands-on" training will consist of&#13;
maternal and perinatal care in the hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, polyclinic, and FAP setting. The&#13;
following sets of training equipment will be provided to each Oblast Model Hospital under the PHC&#13;
Component (and must be shared by both the Women's Reproductive Health sub-component and the&#13;
ARI/CDD subcomponent): Television, VCR, slide projector, overhead projector and screen; I flipchart&#13;
stand and a set of physiological training models (women's pelvis to practice assisted delivery; and&#13;
newborn baby to practice newborn resuscitation). A limited list of essential maternal health care drugs&#13;
and clinical equipment will be provided to the upgraded model hospitals, polyclinics and FAPs for the&#13;
ongoing training activities.&#13;
39.   In Phase 3. of the training program, Primary Health Care Teams from  the peripheral&#13;
Feldshers/Accoucheur Posts (FAPs), Ambulatories (SVAs), Polyclinics and Rural Hospitals will be&#13;
trained by Oblast Hospital and Central Raion Hospital staff (this will depend on distances to be travelled&#13;
and the arrangements for training will vary in different Oblasts).&#13;
40.   Introduce adapted WIHO "Mother-Baby Package" in pre-service and in-service training&#13;
curricula of doctors and paramedics: To ensure longterm sustainability of these training activities the&#13;
newly developed guidelines will be integrated into the pre-service and in-service training at the medical&#13;
and paramedical colleges. Trainers from these schools to be trained as National and Oblast trainers.&#13;
(iii)   Upgrade Health Facilities:&#13;
41.   Develop a "model" hospital, polylinic, and FAP in each oblast: Maternal, gynecological and&#13;
children's departments in Oblast hospitals will be rationalized to form a model hospital complex in each&#13;
Oblast (merging of departments and buildings, redeployment of staff, pooling of equipment and&#13;
spareparts, etc.). An adult therapy clinic, women's consultation clinic, and children's clinic will be&#13;
merged (if not already merged) to form a model polyclinic nearby the model hospital in each Oblast . A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
nearby FAP will also be selected as a model FAP. These 20 facilities (2 CCMEs, 6 Model Hospitals,&#13;
6 Model Polyclinics and 6 FAPS) will be upgraded with equipment, essential drugs and staff training and&#13;
used as model health facilities for the training activities in each Oblast. The longterm goal is that the&#13;
upgrading and rationalization process that takes place in these model sites will be replicated in health&#13;
facilities throughout each Oblast.&#13;
42.   Provide essential maternal health drugs to selected health facilities: The sub-component will&#13;
provide essential drugs in two annual tranches (see Table 5 for proposed list). These drugs will be&#13;
earmarked for maternal and perinatal health training activities in 20 model training centers. After specific&#13;
training a small pack of essential drugs and supplies for obstetric emergencies will be given to every FAP&#13;
and SVA team attending the training course. The remaining essential drugs will be distributed to 12&#13;
Raions (28 % of all Raions) for distribution to SVAs and FAPS. The Raions will be selected on the basis&#13;
of having the worst maternal, perinatal and infant health indicators in that Oblast.&#13;
43.   Provide a basic list of clinical equipment for selected health facilities nationwide: The&#13;
following basic clinical equipment will be provided to 170 SVAs nationwide (this will complement the&#13;
equipment donated by the German Government's KFW) to strengthen the work of the primary health care&#13;
level: 1 Tuning fork, I Reflex hammer, 1 Stethoscope, I Auriscope, 1 Sphygmomanometer, I Needle &amp;&#13;
syringe sterilizer, 5 Glass syringes, 1 Thermometer adult, I Thermometer infant, 1 Nurses Instrument&#13;
Suture kit, I Glucometer sei, I Examination lamp, I Sterile instrument container set for autoclave, 2 Trash&#13;
cans, 1 Flashlight, 1 Peak flow meter, 1 Basic light microscope, I Fetoscope, I Tongue depressor, 10 sets&#13;
Urine analysis dipsticks (see Table 7 for specifications). This basic equipment will also be provided for&#13;
the model hospitals (2 sets), polyclinics (2 sets) and FAPs (2 sets) in each Oblast to strengthen their role&#13;
as model training sites. A more extensive set of equipment will be provided to the 30 converted Rural&#13;
Hospitals being refurbished under the Facilities Rehabilitation Component. These 30 sets will include&#13;
equipment for infant resuscitation, a fetoscope, a hemoglobinometer and infant beds. All 43 Central&#13;
Raion Hospitals will be provided with a basic instruments to handle complicated delivery cases.&#13;
(iv)   Improve Public Awareness:&#13;
44.   Make available culturally appropriate printed materials, for the general public, on maternal&#13;
and perinatal health and appropriate health seeking behavior: This activity strengthens the capacity&#13;
of MOH's Republican Health Education Center to inform the general public about women's reproductive&#13;
health issues and appropriate utilization of the primary health care services. In an effort to integrate the&#13;
different activities of the primary health care component; namely maternal and newborn care, home&#13;
management of common childhood diseases such as respiratory and diarrheal diseases, and adult health&#13;
care to prevent and control sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, smoking and diet related&#13;
conditions; funds will be provided for the development, printing and distribution of one booklet providing&#13;
information on all these conditions in the context of family life. This book will be printed in Russian and&#13;
Kyrgyz. The Republican Health Center will develop the booklets with technical assistance provided by&#13;
a GTZ funded technical advisor who will provide technical assistance in pretesting messages through&#13;
techniques such as target group surveys and focus group discussions. The objective is to conduct field&#13;
testing during development of the booklet so that it is both visually pleasing to the population and contains&#13;
appropriate and understandable information. Topics to be covered will include preparing for pregnancy&#13;
(including nutrition), what to expect in pregnancy and delivery; recognition of danger signs, problems&#13;
and emergencies; what health services are available for pregnant women, whom to contact for help, how&#13;
to contact them and the means available to travel to the health facility in the case of an emergency;&#13;
breastfeeding, and caring for an infant. The booklets will be distributed free of charge to the general&#13;
public by health facility staff at the primary health care level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                             ANNEX 2.A&#13;
E. Program Supervision&#13;
45.   Regular supervision of the National Maternal and Perinatal Program, by MOH and Oblast&#13;
program managers is essential, to ensure implementation of the sub-component's activities, particularly&#13;
regarding case management and reporting. The MOH and Oblast Health Administrations must ensure&#13;
that their supervisory staff are mobile enough to perform adequate supervision. These travel costs should&#13;
come out of the counterpart funding of the project.&#13;
F. Project Management&#13;
46.   The MOH will have overall responsibility for the PHC component, including the Women's&#13;
Reproductive Health sub-component, in close coordination with Oblast and Raion Health Administrations.&#13;
The TCC will have one full-time advisor to coordinate all PHC activities. To strengthen MOH&#13;
management capacity management training courses will be conducted by the project and a computer,&#13;
printer, and software training will be provided to the Chief Obstetrician.&#13;
G. Benefits and Risks&#13;
47.   The Ministry of Health, has been downsized, and plans are underway to cut staffing levels even&#13;
further. This is coupled with a lack of management capacity. The ability of the MOH to supervise the&#13;
program effectively is in doubt. However, there is tremendous government commitment to health reform&#13;
and safe motherhood programs and some very talented and dedicated people in the government health&#13;
system. The project design includes a phased implementation of the PHC Component to avoid excessive&#13;
burden on the MOH. Changing case management protocols is notoriously difficult, particularly at the&#13;
tertiary health facilities level. Unless case management at these Republican hospitals (the training ground&#13;
for future doctors) are improved, it will be difficult to make changes lower down the health system.&#13;
Attempts to integrate services will meet with strong opposition from health personnel at all levels of the&#13;
health system whose jobs are at stake. There is some resistance in the government to the treatment of&#13;
certain social groups with STDs on an anonymous ambulatory basis.&#13;
H. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
48.   Three sets of indicators will be used to monitor the implementation of this sub-component: input&#13;
indicators, process/output/service indicators, and outcome indicators. The data will be collected through&#13;
current reporting mechanisms and additional health facility surveys (baseline, mid-project, end-of-project).&#13;
The TCC Primary Health Care coordinator and MOH can use the following indicators to monitor the&#13;
progress of the project. These can be converted into checklists and used as spot checks on field visits.&#13;
A more limited list of Performance Monitoring Indicators have been selected for the monitoring of the&#13;
project by the World Bank.&#13;
49.   Input Indicators will track planned resource inputs such as the following:&#13;
(a)    Study tours in the first year of project.&#13;
(b)    Person weeks of technical assistance per year.&#13;
(c)    Procurement and disbursement of essential drugs.&#13;
(d)    Procurement and disbursement of clinical equipment.&#13;
(e)    Procurement and disbursement of training equipment (TV, VCR, models, etc.).&#13;
(f)    Procurement and disbursement of computers and printers.&#13;
50.   Process indicators will track the training activities:&#13;

(n)    Percentage of communities with organized transport systems in place to effect referral.&#13;
(o)    Percentage of health centers with referral links (eg., communication, transport) to&#13;
facilities that can provide emergency obstetrical care.&#13;
(p)    Time required for an emergency patient to receive appropriate treatment at referral site.&#13;
52.   Outcome indicators will track change in health status of the mothers and infants. The&#13;
mortality rates are not expected to change significantly in the four year life of the project.&#13;
(a)    Maternal Mortality Rate.&#13;
(b)    Perinatal Mortality Rate.&#13;
(c)    Infant Mortality Rate.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 2.B: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE - ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AND&#13;
DIARRHEAL DISEASE CONTROL SUBCOMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1. In 1991, the corrected infant mortality rate (IMR) for the Kyrgyz Republic, 40 per 1000 live births,&#13;
was slightly lower than the average IMR for upper middle income countries (about 45 per 1,000 live&#13;
births). A few countries (such as China and Sri Lanka) with lower income per capita report an IMR better&#13;
than that of the Kyrgyz Republic, but most have an IMR even higher. The mortality indicators however,&#13;
have shown little improvement over the past ten to fifteen years (the IMR declined only ten percent from&#13;
1970 to 1985).&#13;
Uncorrected Infant Mortality Rates per 1000 live births (source MOH)&#13;

2.    In the Kyrgyz Republic, as shown in the table below, acute respiratory infections, perinatal&#13;
conditions and diarrheal diseases are responsible for over 90% of infant deaths. As can be seen in the&#13;
"Prioritization Framework" table, acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases account for most of&#13;
the potential Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss per year. An acute respiratory infections&#13;
program and diarrheal diseases control program (ARI/CDD program) are the most cost-effective health&#13;
interventions to reduce the IMR in the Kyrgyz Republic. However, international experience has shown&#13;
that a reduction in IMR would not be expected until 5-6 years after the introduction of the program.&#13;
Respiratory infections accounted for over half of infant deaths in Naryn, Osh, Djalal Abad and Talas&#13;
Oblasts. The proportion of diarrhea deaths are particularly high in Osh and Djalal Abad Oblasts in the&#13;
south of the country. Most acute respiratory disease deaths occur in the long winter months (90% of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic is covered in high mountains) and most diarrhea related deaths in the summer months,&#13;
particularly in the warmer southern regions. A child who is malnourished and has an acute respiratory&#13;
infection or diarrhea is more likely to die than a child who is not malnourished and has an acute&#13;
respiratory infection or diarrhea. Malnutrition is on the increase in the Kyrgyz Republic. Over 7% of&#13;
all pre-school children are acutely malnourished, and this rises to 15% in some regions (Kyrgyz Multi-&#13;
Purpose Survey 1994).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                               ANNEX 2.B&#13;
3.     Most of the infant deaths due to infectious diseases such as acute respiratory infections and&#13;
diarrhea are concentrated in the rural areas of the Kyrgyz Republic, where the rates of mortality due to&#13;
these causes is two to three times higher than that of urban areas. The rural areas are more mountainous&#13;
and health facilities more limited. The infant mortality in rural areas increases sharply during the winter&#13;
months, probably reflecting variations in mortality rates due to acute respiratory infections, as seasonality&#13;
is negligible in urban areas. Children reach the health facility too late: leading to a high proportion of&#13;
deaths within the first 24 hours of admission (32% of admissions in 1993). At the same time&#13;
hospitalization rates for children with ARIs is very high and the majority of children with ARI do not&#13;
need to be admitted. The high rates of acute respiratory infections is probably due to a combination of&#13;
three factors: intra-household combustion of wood, the ignorance of parents of the early signs and&#13;
symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection, and inadequate clinical management of the disease. These&#13;
ARI deaths are concentrated particularly in under 5 year olds.&#13;
4.     Although the rate of mortality due to diarrheal diseases is only one fourth of the rate due to acute&#13;
respiratory diseases, the majority of the deaths are probably preventable. The average case fatality rate&#13;
of 1.2% and hospital case fatality rate of 3% are very high, but could be due to the high under reporting&#13;
of diarrhea cases. Two main strategies are needed: promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first four&#13;
months of life and prolonged to one year, and better home and health facility case management of&#13;
diarrheal episodes following WHO guidelines, including rehydration therapy with home fluids and ORS&#13;
packets and antibiotics for dysenteric cases. Oral rehydration therapy has been promoted in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic since 1985. ORT corners were established at primary health care facilities. The Ministry of&#13;
Health in collaboration with UNICEF initiated a control of diarrheal disease program in 1992, and&#13;
UNICEF is supplying 500,000 ORS packets annually. Despite these efforts ORS is not on the newly&#13;
developed national list of essential drugs. Outmoded treatments such as bacterium bifidum and&#13;
"biostimulators" are still recommended for diarrhea treatment in MOH guidelines and the major teaching&#13;
hospitals. USAID (through Wellstart) and UNICEF have funded breastfeeding promotion activities and&#13;
UNICEF plan to launch a Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative.&#13;

5.    It is the practice, in all the former Soviet countries, to have pediatricians treating ARIs; and&#13;
infectious diseases specialists treating diarrhea in separate infectious disease wards and hospitals. Acute&#13;
respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are also the most common childhood diseases seen in clinics&#13;
and admitted to hospitals. In 1991, 47% of all children under one year suffered from a respiratory&#13;
infection. Nearly half of all hospital admissions in children are for respiratory diseases. In 1991, 70%&#13;
of all under one year olds seen in the outpatient department with a respiratory infection were admitted&#13;
to hospital. In the same year, 40% of all under fifteen year olds were hospitalized. These very high&#13;
hospitalization rates for what is usually a mild viral infection, are quite inappropriate. This is confirmed&#13;
by observations in the field. Hospital beds are indeed occupied by children with mild respiratory&#13;
infections who could be equally well managed at home. At the same time there are very sick children in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95                             ANNEX 2.B&#13;
the community, who are arriving at the hospital too late. What is required is a comprehensive mass media&#13;
campaign for the general public, combined with major retraining of health workers. In addition, reduced&#13;
capacity in the government drug procurement and distribution agency, Pharmacia, has resulted in a&#13;
shortage of ARI/CDD drugs throughout the government health system.&#13;
6.    Acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease in under five year olds have already been&#13;
identified by the government and the donor community as priority health problems. In the government's&#13;
"Health For All 1994-2000" program, breastfeeding, ARI and diarrheal disease control have been&#13;
included as the priority interventions. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH), a UNICEF&#13;
funded ARI/CDD program started in 1993. In 1994, the MOH developed a National ARI/CDD Program&#13;
and appointed a National ARI/CDD programn manager, Dr. Apisa Kushbakeeva, the Chief Pediatrician&#13;
at the MOH. A National ARI/CDD Policy has not been finalized or endorsed. A report of a World&#13;
Bank/WHO consultant, Dr. E. Kudlova, "Evaluation of the Status of ARI/CDD Program in Kyrgyzstan-&#13;
July 1995" revealed that even in the Republican Institute hospitals, children with ARIs and diarrhea are&#13;
admitted unnecessarily and treated with inappropriate case management protocols. Her report identified&#13;
the following shortcomings in the MOH/UNICEF ARI/CDD programs:&#13;
(i)    Lack of national CDD/ARI policy and case management guidelines;&#13;
(ii)   Inadequate supervision, management, surveillance of ARI/CDD activities at all levels;&#13;
(iii)   Lack of WHO ARI/CDD Russian materials in the Kyrgyz Republic, despite being&#13;
available.&#13;
(iv)   Lack of ARI/CDD case management training including clinical "hands-on" practice;&#13;
(v)   Inappropriate use of drugs for the treatment of diarrhea and ARI, inappropriate&#13;
rehydration of dehydrated cases, unnecessary hospitalization of CDD/ARI cases at&#13;
tertiary, secondary and primary health care levels; and&#13;
(vi)   Some incorrect mass media health messages on the home management of ARI/CDD.&#13;
B. Role of Other Donors&#13;
7.     UNICEF, in collaboration with the MOH, began an ARI/CDD control program in 1992, using&#13;
the case management guidelines developed by WHO. UNICEF funded some training activities, provided&#13;
a television and VCR (which were lost), and supplied and transported essential drugs to primary health&#13;
care facilities bypassing the Government system. This case management training has not reached health&#13;
workers at all levels of the health system. The Republican Health Education Center has limited capacity&#13;
to mobilize the general public in appropriate health seeking behavior for ARI/CDD and UNICEF has&#13;
been forced to use the private sector to get ARI/CDD television messages out to the general public. The&#13;
full implementation of this program has been patchy due to limited resources and the diminished capacity&#13;
in several MOH departments. UNICEF will continue to take the lead in the training of health workers&#13;
at the primary health level and the World Bank subcomponent will focus on the development of model&#13;
training centers and a core of trainers. UNICEF will continue to supply ARI and CDD drugs through a&#13;
series of winter and summer programs, targeted at under 5 year olds. The World Bank/WHO consultant&#13;
calculated that the UNICEF contribution of 500,000 ORS packets cover about 70% of the estimated need.&#13;
The World Bank supply of ARI/CDD drugs will cover this shortfall in national drug requirements. The&#13;
UNICEF and World Bank drug supplies to the primary health care level will need to be closely&#13;
coordinated.&#13;
8.    GTZ, the German Government's technical assistance program, plan to fund short term technical&#13;
assistance to the Republican Health Education Center over a 10 year period, starting in 1996. The&#13;
German Government's KFW, is supplying over US$2 million worth of equipment to all Feldsher&#13;
Accoucheur Posts (FAPs), Rural Physician Ambulatories (SVAs) and Central Rayon Hospitals and the&#13;
shipment is expected to arrive in early 1996. The equipment provided under the PHC Component will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                             ANNEX 2.B&#13;
complement this equipment. WHO has an Information Center and full-time liaison officer based in&#13;
Bishkek city. The Information Center has a library with a wide selection of WHO books including some&#13;
on ARI/CDD in Russian and English and can be contracted to translate materials into Russian.&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
9.     In the short term, the current economic crisis will slow down or reverse improvements in living&#13;
conditions, but a significant reduction in the burden of disease can still be achieved at low cost through&#13;
improving the coverage and quality of some health interventions. This should be possible in view of the&#13;
high level of education of the population, and the vast health infrastructure. About sixty percent of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic's infant mortality is caused by acute respiratory infections and diarrhea. ARI and CDD&#13;
programs using WHO guidelines are two of the most cost-effective programs; as shown in the 1993&#13;
World Development Report: Investing in Health.&#13;
10.   The World Bank activities will complement the more comprehensive nation-wide primary health&#13;
care training program planned by UNICEF for 1996-2001, by focusing on the hospital level. An&#13;
evaluation of the ARI/CDD program in 1995, by a WHO consultant, showed that although some progress&#13;
had been made in training at the peripheral level, case management is patchy, and a comprehensive&#13;
retraining program throughout all levels of the health system, from the major teaching institutes&#13;
downwards, is required. The Bank project will focus on improving the quality of "hands-on" case&#13;
management training and institutionalizing this practical training within the Department of Continuous&#13;
Medical Education and a network of Oblast model health facilities (one hospital, one polyclinic and one&#13;
FAP per Oblast) to be developed under the PHC component. The Bank project will also strengthen the&#13;
capacities of government institutions to provide essential ARI/CDD drugs and promote health education.&#13;
D. ARI/CDD Subcomponent Description&#13;
I 1. - The long term goals of the Acute Respiratory Infections and Control of Diarrheal Disease&#13;

ARI/CDD case management in each Oblast;&#13;
(b)    Provide essential ARI/CDD drugs to selected health facilities nationwide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97                              ANNEX 2.B&#13;
(coordinating with UNICEF's drug supply to the PHC level).&#13;
(c)    Provide a basic list of clinical equipment for selected health facilities nationwide.&#13;
(iv)   Improve Public Awareness:&#13;
(a)    Make available culturally appropriate printed materials, for the general public,&#13;
on the home management of ARI and diarrheal diseases and appropriate health&#13;
seeking behavior.&#13;
13.   At the end of the project there will be a:&#13;
(i)    Strengthened Program Management:&#13;
(a)    Trained child health program managers at the Ministry of Health and Oblast&#13;
Health Administrations;&#13;
(b)    A national strategy, as part of the National Policy for ARI/CDD Control&#13;
activities, to rationalize and integrate activities.&#13;
(ii)    Upgraded Health Provider Skills:&#13;
(a)    Increased training capacity and management capacity within the Centers of&#13;
Continuous Medical Education in Bishkek and Osh; and a decentralization of&#13;
training to the newly established Oblast Model Hospitals;&#13;
(b)    Core teams of trainers at national, Oblast and Raion level;&#13;
(c)    500 health providers trained in the adapted WHO ARI/CDD case management&#13;
guidelines;&#13;
(d)    Pediatricians and infectious disease specialists at national, Oblast and Raion levels&#13;
(UNICEF will train all primary health care level staff).&#13;
(iii)   Upgraded Health Facilities:&#13;
(a)    Model hospital, polyclinic and FAP in each Oblast with restructured, rationalized&#13;
and integrated pediatric and infectious diseases services.&#13;
(b)    Essential drugs for ARI/CDD training activities provided to 20 model training&#13;
centers. After specific training a small pack of essential drugs and supplies for&#13;
ARI/CDD will be given to every FAP and SVA team attending the training&#13;
course.&#13;
(c)    Essential drugs provided in two annual tranches for ARI/CDD to 12 Raions (28%&#13;
of all Raions) for distribution to SVAs and FAPs. The Raions will be selected on&#13;
the basis of having the worst maternal, perinatal and infant health indicators, in&#13;
close coordination with UNICEF.&#13;
(iv)   Improved Public Awareness:&#13;
(a)    Booklets on family health for the general public distributed free of charge from&#13;
primary health care facilities.&#13;
14.   Technical Assistance: Four months of international technical assistance will be required over&#13;
the four years of the project: 2 months in Year 1, one month in Year 2, and 2 weeks in Year 3 and Year&#13;
4. The technical assistance will be required to conduct training courses and a study tour (see attached&#13;
terms of reference in Table 2). A doctor with considerable experience in pediatrics, and the management&#13;
of diarrheal cases and acute respiratory infections is preferred. The consultant(s) should be familiar with&#13;
WHO training materials on ARI/CDD, and should have experience in conducting case management and&#13;
program management training courses. Local technical assistance will be required for computer software&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                             ANNEX 2.B&#13;
15.   The activities of the subcomponent are described in greater detail below:&#13;
(i)    Strengthen Program Management:&#13;
16.   Improve ARI/CDD program management at the Ministry of Health and Oblast Health&#13;
Administration levels: Special emphasis will be placed on strengthening the MOH national, Oblast and&#13;
Raion management to ensure adequate surveillance, supervision and monitoring of the ARI/CDD&#13;
programs. A range of workshops and on-the-job training will be conducted for MOH and Oblast Health&#13;
Administration program managers and other key people (management training, computer software&#13;
training, national policy development workshop, regular program review workshops). The subcomponent&#13;
will provide equipment for the Chief Pediatrician at the Ministry of Health (computer, printer &amp; software&#13;
training). The Chief Pediatrician will be trained to allocate her time more efficiently by refocusing their&#13;
work to policy development and monitoring. The major work must be largely decentralized to the Oblast&#13;
Health Administration.&#13;
17.   An Acute Respiratory Diseases and Control of Diarrheal Diseases Study Tour will be arranged&#13;
in the second year of the project for 10 people over a two week period. Participants will include child&#13;
health program managers from the Ministry of Health and Oblast Health Administrations (Chief&#13;
Pediatricians), and national clinical specialists in pediatrics and infectious diseases. The group will travel&#13;
with one facilitator and one interpreter. The objective of the study tour is to observe effective National&#13;
ARI/CDD programs (following WHO guidelines both in program management and clinical case&#13;
management with integration of services at the primary health care level) in other countries. The study&#13;
tour participants should visit the following:&#13;
(i)    Ministry of Health to discuss the National ARI/CDD program with MOH program&#13;
managers (including mass media campaigns, surveillance, ORS supply and distribution,&#13;
etc.);&#13;
(ii)   Regional Health Departments to discuss the Regional ARI/CDD programs with Regional&#13;
program managers&#13;
(iii)   Oral Rehydration Units in a primary health care level facility&#13;
(iv)   ARI/Diarrhea Training Units to observe the "hands on" case management training of&#13;
workshop participants and to gain "hands on" experience in treating children with&#13;
diarrhea and dehydration. The participants should spend a couple of days gaining&#13;
experience in the administration of ORS to a dehydrated child. There should be an&#13;
adequate number of dehydrated cases to allow this.&#13;
(v)    Hospital pediatric wards to demonstrate that ARI and diarrhea cases can be treated in the&#13;
same ward;&#13;
(vi)   Primary health care clinics with integrated services;&#13;
Community based services.&#13;
18.   A Terms of Reference for this study tour is attached in Table 3. Possible countries could include&#13;
Egypt, Bangladesh (International Center for Diarrheal Disease Control in Dacca); and Pakistan (USAID&#13;
funded Diarrhea Training Units).&#13;
19.   Develop a national strategy for the rationalization and integration of ARI/CDD services: The&#13;
various Republican level institutions involved in child health will be encouraged to coordinate activities&#13;
with the MOH and Oblast Health Administrations through the formation of a national task force: Kyrgyz&#13;
State Medical Institute, Faculty of Continuous Medical Education, Republican Paramedic Medical&#13;
College, the Republican Institute for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Pediatrics, and the Republican Institute&#13;
for Infectious Diseases. A national strategy and planning workshop is scheduled to prepare the policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
99                              ANNEX 2.B&#13;
and plans of action to define national objectives, establish targets and subtargets for the major activities:&#13;
training, supervision, logistics, communication, monitoring and evaluation. The task force will develop&#13;
a strategy on the rationalization of services and integration into the primary health care level, to be&#13;
incorporated into the National ARI/CDD Program.&#13;
20.   The WHO definitions for health indicators will have to be adopted and medical audit and quality&#13;
assurance procedures put into place. A new system of supervision will replace the old style punitive&#13;
approach based upon the use of orders and decrees, which have largely ossified in time. Existing child&#13;
health management information systems will be improved through a rationalization of reporting (introduce&#13;
new home-based mothers records, tally sheets, referral letters, report forms, etc.). At present health&#13;
providers and managers spend a large proportion of their work day on data collection and report writing,&#13;
detracting from their other duties. The registration of newborns should be improved with direct referral&#13;
of the newborn card to the registration office, with minimal costs to the parents. Linkages between the&#13;
different levels of health facilities needs to be improved through rationalization of referral criteria. Service&#13;
provision by the private sector and non-government organizations must be encouraged for cost saving&#13;
purposes, and these new services coordinated and integrated into the general referral system. The MOH&#13;
has been compiling the essential drug list and will be responsible for maintaining and regularly updating&#13;
a database on rational drug prescribing and the WHO case management protocols. Regular updates should&#13;
be circulated to health providers.&#13;
21.   A small baseline health facility survey will aim to establish baseline data against which&#13;
improvements in the standard ARI/CDD case management can later be measured. This survey will be&#13;
undertaken by the MOH and Oblast program managers as part of their case management training&#13;
workshop. The survey and a focused program review (FPR) will then be repeated mid-project and at the&#13;
end of the project. The results of this health facility survey, which is really an internal evaluation&#13;
mechanism for program managers, will allow them to "tailor" the national CDD and ARI program,&#13;
monitoring progress and identifying priority areas which will require special attention at different points&#13;
in the project. UNICEF will organize the equally important household surveys on ARI/CDD home&#13;
management, the first one having been conducted in November 1995.&#13;
(ii)    Upgrade Health Provider Skills:&#13;
22.   The health worker training will be implemented in three phases as shown in the table below:&#13;
Phase 1. Training of National and Oblast Trainers&#13;
Phase 2. Training of Oblast Hospital and Central Raion Hospital staff and trainers&#13;
Phase 3. Training of Primary Health Care Teams (UNICEF program).&#13;
The project will fund Phases 1-2 and UNICEF will fund Phase 3.&#13;
23.   This will require the following workshops:&#13;
(i)    Practical intensive "hands-on" training of pediatricians and infectious disease specialists;&#13;
(ii)    Training of trainers case management training for National trainers;&#13;
(iii)   Training of trainers case management training for Oblast trainers;&#13;
(iv)   Case management training for staff from 6 Oblast Model Hospitals (one workshop per&#13;
Oblast);&#13;
(v)    Case management training for staff from 43 Central Raion Hospitals;&#13;
24.   A more detailed breakdown of the training is shown in the training timetable. A core National&#13;
and Oblast training team of 14 pediatricians, 14 infectious disease specialists, and 14 nurses will be&#13;
trained in Phase 1. They will then train Oblast model health facility (15 per Oblast) and Central Raion&#13;
hospital staff (6 per Central Raion Hospital). A total of 420 health providers will be trained in Phases 2.&#13;

25.   Develop a training package: A well defined set of national policies will be developed and these&#13;
will be used as the basis for the technical guidelines on case management of diarrheal diseases and acute&#13;
respiratory infections. The guidelines will be developed by a team of national experts, with the assistance&#13;
of an international technical advisor. The guidelines will cover two major areas of the program activities:&#13;
first - management of the patient at home and in the outpatient departments, and, second - management&#13;
of complicated cases in hospital. Different types of guidelines will be developed for different types of&#13;
health workers and different types of program activities: rational use of drugs, community involvement,&#13;
prevention, etc.. These guidelines will involve reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics and other&#13;
drugs; in order to decrease the cost of treatment, the need for hospitalization, and the harmful&#13;
consequences of inappropriate drug treatment.&#13;
26.   The focus of the case management training is on the recognition of clinical signs in the child and&#13;
the appropriate use of antibiotics for a few specified disease categories. Participants will learn how to give&#13;
oral rehydration salts to a child with different grades of dehydration. The current case management of&#13;
respiratory diseases and diarrheal diseases in the major hospitals will need considerable upgrading before&#13;
they can be used as training units. Many children with respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases&#13;
receive multiple antibiotic therapy and unnecessary hospitalization. Children with diarrhea and no signs&#13;
of dehydration receive intravenous fluids often under sedation. The outmoded hospital case management&#13;
practices have considerably impeded the impact of the UNICEF funded training at the PHC level. Unless&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101                            ANNEX 2.B&#13;
the tertiary and secondary levels adopt the new treatment protocols it is very difficult for the primary&#13;
health care level to adopt these protocols. This subcomponent will focus on training at these tertiary and&#13;
secondary levels to enhance the work of UNICEF at the primary health care level. Intensive on-site&#13;
training of model health facility staff by ARI and CDD clinical experts will be required in the initial&#13;
phase of the project to bring them up to the standards of WHO recognized ARI and CDD training units.&#13;
These training courses will use WHO case management guidelines which are already available in Russian.&#13;
ARI training should take place in the winter season and CDD in the summer season. It may be possible&#13;
to do combined training in September-October when the seasons merge and both types of clinical cases&#13;
will be present in the hospitals.&#13;
27.   The following WHO training modules will be taught to hospital level pediatricians, infectious&#13;
disease specialists and pediatric nurses (and Model Polyclinic and FAP staff) under this subcomponent:&#13;
(i)    Outpatient management of young children with ARI&#13;
(ii)    Hospital management of young children with ARI&#13;
(iii)   Outpatient management of young children with diarrhea&#13;
(iv)   Hospital management of young children with diarrhea&#13;
28.   Facilitator's Manuals and Participant's Manuals for the training modules above are already&#13;
available in Russian and will be printed in this subcomponent and distributed to the trainers and&#13;
participants. The guidelines will be printed early in the project to coincide with the start of training&#13;
activities. All health workers trained will be provided with case management charts and other materials&#13;
adapted from the original WHO management charts, as work aids for effective case management. Other&#13;
WHO training modules for CDD will include:&#13;
(i)    Management of bloody diarrhea in children&#13;
(ii)    Management and prevention of acute diarrhea&#13;
(iii)   Rational use of drugs in diarrhea in children&#13;
(iv)   Guidelines for treatment of cholera&#13;
(v)    Dietary management of a child with diarrhea&#13;
(vi)   Readings on diarrhea - Student manual&#13;
Other WHO training modules for ARI will include:&#13;
(i)    Antibiotics in the treatment of ARIs in small children.&#13;
(ii)    Oxygen therapy for ARI in young children.&#13;
(iii)   Management of fever in young children with ARI.&#13;
(iv)   Bronchodilators and other medications for wheeze associated illness in young children.&#13;
The WHO Information Center, in Bishkek, has a library with many of these materials and can be&#13;
requested to order updated WHO guidelines as they become available over the course of the project.&#13;
29.   Strengthen and decentralize training sites: An objective of this subcomponent is to increase&#13;
training capacity within the country through a process of institution strengthening and decentralization&#13;
in order to implement the ARI/CDD guidelines in a sustainable way. The quality of practical training will&#13;
be improved through a focus on intensive "hands-on" training in a clinical setting with real patients. The&#13;
training will take place at the two already established Centers of Continuous Medical Education in&#13;
Bishkek and Osh (both faculties of the Medical Institute); and the model health facilities (one&#13;
multispecialty hospital, one multispecialty polyclinic, and one FAP) to be developed during the project&#13;
in each of the 6 Oblasts.&#13;
30.   The Center of Continuous Medical Education (CCME), in Bishkek City, will act as the focus for&#13;
all training activities in Phase 1 of the project and will be responsible for training coordination&#13;
nationwide. The CCME has a sub-department in Osh City, and this sub-department will play a training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                            ANNEX 2.B&#13;
and coordinating role for the southern Kyrgyz Republic. The following set of office and training&#13;
equipment will be provided under the Primary Health Care Component for each of these CCMEs: one&#13;
computer, one printer &amp; software (plus training), one heavy duty photocopier, one fax machine, one&#13;
television, one VCR, one slide projector, one overhead projector and screen; 1 flipchart stand).&#13;
31.   Train a core of National and Oblast trainers: In Phase 1 of the training program, the National&#13;
and Oblast Trainers will receive training at the CCME in Bishkek City and the National hospitals. These&#13;
trainers will be selected from medical and paramedical colleges and National Postgraduate Institutes.&#13;
Intensive in-hospital training of these national and oblast hospital pediatric and infectious disease&#13;
specialists by foreign experts will be required in the initial phase of the project; followed by a training&#13;
of trainers course. Some trainers will also participate in the study tour to practice "hands-on" case&#13;
management in other countries.&#13;
32.   Train health providers at National, Oblast and Raion levels: In Phase 2, the Oblast model&#13;
hospitals will be trained and they will then be responsible for training Central Raion Hospital staff. Local&#13;
part-time training coordinators will be funded by the project to work in each of the 6 Oblast model&#13;
hospitals. The practical "hands-on" training will take place in the hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient,&#13;
polyclinic, and FAP setting. The following sets of training equipment will be provided to each Oblast&#13;
Model Hospital under the PHC Component (and must be shared by both the Maternal and Perinatal&#13;
Health subcomponent and the ARI/CDD subcomponent): Television, VCR, slide projector, overhead&#13;
projector and screen; 1 flipchart stand. A limited list of essential ARI/CDD drugs and clinical equipment&#13;
will be provided to the upgraded model hospitals, polyclinics and FAPs for the ongoing training activities.&#13;
33.   In Phase 3. of the training program, Primary Health Care Teams from the peripheral FAPs,&#13;
SVAs, and Rural Hospitals will be trained by the Ministry of Health and UNICEF. They can draw upon&#13;
the core of Oblast trainers trained under this subcomponent.&#13;
34.   Introduce adapted WHO ARI/CDD case management package in pre-service and in-service&#13;
training curricula of doctors and paramedics: To ensure long term sustainability of these training&#13;
activities the newly developed guidelines will be integrated into the pre-service and in-service training&#13;
at the medical and paramedical colleges. Trainers from these colleges will be trained as National and&#13;
Oblast trainers.&#13;
(iii)   Upgrade Health Facilities:&#13;
35.   Develop a "model' hospital, polyclinic, and FAP providing WHO recommended ARI/CDD&#13;
case management in each Oblast: Pediatric infectious diseases departments (where children with diarrhea&#13;
are treated) and pediatric departments (where children with ARIs are treated) in Oblast hospitals will be&#13;
rationalized to form a model hospital complex in each Oblast (merging of departments and buildings,&#13;
redeployment of staff, pooling of equipment and spare parts, etc.). An adult therapy clinic, women's&#13;
consultation clinic, and children's clinic will be merged (if not already merged) to form a model&#13;
polyclinic nearby the model hospital in each Oblast. A nearby FAP will also be selected as a model&#13;
FAP. These 20 facilities (2 CCMEs, 6 Model Hospitals, 6 Model Polyclinics and 6 FAPs) will be&#13;
upgraded with equipment, essential drugs and staff training and used as model health facilities for the&#13;
ARI/CDD training activities in each Oblast. The long term goal is that the upgrading and rationalization&#13;
process that takes place in these model sites will be replicated in health facilities throughout each Oblast.&#13;
36.   Provide essential ARI/CDD drugs to selected health facilities (coordinating with UNICEF's&#13;
drug supply to the PHC level): The subcomponent will provide essential drugs in two annual tranches.&#13;
See suggested list in table . These drugs will be earmarked for ARI/CDD case management training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
103                            ANNEX 2.B&#13;
activities in 6 Oblasts (6 Model Hospitals, 6 Model Polyclinics and 6 FAPs). After specific training a&#13;
small pack of essential drugs and supplies for ARI/CDD will be given to every FAP and SVA team&#13;
attending the training course. The remaining essential drugs will be distributed to 12 Raions (28% of all&#13;
Raions) for distribution to SVAs and FAPs. The Raions will be selected on the basis of having the worst&#13;
maternal, perinatal and infant health indicators. UNICEF will also continue to donate and directly&#13;
distribute drugs for the summer diarrhea season and the winter ARI season. This UNICEF donation&#13;
covers about 60-70% of the total drug requirements. The project will provide the remaining 30-40% of&#13;
drugs.&#13;
37.   Provide a basic list of clinical equipment for selected health facilities nationwide: Under the&#13;
Primary Health Care Component, the following basic clinical equipment will be provided to 170 SVAs&#13;
nationwide (this will complement the equipment donated by the German Government's KFW) to&#13;
strengthen the work of the primary health care level: 1 Tuning fork, 1 Reflex hammer, 1 Stethoscope,&#13;
1 Auriscope, 1 Sphygmomanometer, 1 Needle &amp; syringe sterilizer, 5 Glass syringes, 1 Thermometer&#13;
adult, 1 Thermometer infant, 1 Nurses Instrument Suture kit, 1 Glucometer set, 1 Examination lamp, 1&#13;
Sterile instrument container set for autoclave, 2 Trash cans, 1 Flashlight, 1 Peak flow meter, 1 Basic light&#13;
microscope, 1 Fetoscope, 1 Tongue depressor, 10 sets Urine analysis dipsticks (for specifications see&#13;
Table 5). The remaining 43 SVAs in Chui Oblast will be provided with equipment under the Medical&#13;
Provider Payment Component. This basic equipment will also be provided for the model hospitals (2&#13;
sets), polyclinics (2 sets) and FAPs (1 set) in each Oblast to strengthen their role as model training sites.&#13;
(iv)   Improve Public Awareness:&#13;
38.   Make available culturally appropriate printed materials, for the general public, on the home&#13;
management of ARI and diarrheal diseases and appropriate health seeking behavior: Dr. Eva&#13;
Kudlova's report highlighted some of the problems with the information available to the general public&#13;
on the home management of ARIs and diarrhea. Although many people know about ORS, they do not&#13;
seem to know how to give it correctly. Parents do not know when to seek medical help for the sick&#13;
children. In an attempt to correct this lack of public awareness funding will be provided for the&#13;
development and printing of a booklet. In an effort to integrate the different activities of the primary&#13;
health care component; namely maternal and newborn care, home management of common childhood&#13;
diseases such as respiratory and diarrheal diseases, and adult health care to prevent and control sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, smoking and diet related conditions; funds will be provided for the&#13;
development, printing and distribution of one booklet providing information on all these conditions in the&#13;
context of family life. This book will be printed in Russian and Kyrgyz. This activity strengthens the&#13;
capacity of the Republican Health Education Center to mobilize the general public in home-based&#13;
management of ARI and diarrhea and appropriate utilization of the primary health care services. The&#13;
booklets will be distributed free of charge through the primary health care system.&#13;
39.   The Republican Health Center will develop the booklets in collaboration with GTZ funded&#13;
technical advisor who will provide technical assistance in pretesting messages through techniques such&#13;
as target group surveys and focus group discussions. The objective is to conduct field testing during&#13;
development of the booklet so that it is both visually pleasing to the population and contains appropriate&#13;
and understandable information. Topics to be covered will include the home management of ARI and&#13;
diarrhea, the recognition of danger signs in children; what health services are available for children,&#13;
whom to contact for help, how to contact them and the means available to travel to the health facility in&#13;
the case of an emergency; breastfeeding, and caring for an infant. This booklet will also focus on&#13;
reducing ARI risk factors such as reducing adult smoking and improving ventilation in the house,&#13;
especially with cooking fires. Information on the home management of diarrhea and ARI will be available&#13;
after the UNICEF sponsored Household Survey due to be conducted in November 1995. Information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                            ANNEX 2.B&#13;
obtained from this survey on home practices should be incorporated into the booklet.&#13;
E. Program Supervision&#13;
40.   Regular supervision of the National ARI/CDD program, by MOH and Oblast program managers&#13;
is essential, to ensure implementation of the subcomponent's activities, particularly regarding case&#13;
management and reporting. The MOH and Oblast Health Administrations must ensure that their&#13;
supervisory staff are mobile enough to perform adequate supervision. These travel costs should come out&#13;
of the counterpart funding of the project.&#13;
F. Project Management&#13;
41.   The MOH would have overall responsibility for the PHC component, including the ARI/CDD&#13;
subcomponent, in close coordination with Oblast and Raion Health Administrations. The TCC will have&#13;
one full-time advisor to coordinate all PHC activities. To strengthen MOH management capacity a&#13;
computer, printer and software training will be provided to the Chief Pediatrician.&#13;
G. Benefits and Risks&#13;
42.   It has been agreed between the World Bank mission and UNICEF, that UNICEF has the larger&#13;
budget for ARI/CDD and should be the lead agency. This subcomponent has been carefully designed with&#13;
the UNICEF Regional Mission for Central Asia, to complement UNICEF planned activities. There is&#13;
always a risk that these plans may change. In 1995, a World Bank/WHO consultant's review of the&#13;
UNICEF funded ARI/CDD program has revealed a rather patchy training strategy to date. Although&#13;
UNICEF now plans a more comprehensive approach, there is still a risk that their training activities will&#13;
not be institutionalized, and therefore not sustainable. One to avoid this is for UNICEF to use the&#13;
National and Oblast core trainers, the CCMEs, and model health facilities in their training program. The&#13;
benefit to UNICEF taking the lead, is that the MOH has been used to working with UNICEF on&#13;
ARI/CDD, and this collaboration will now continue.&#13;
43.   The Ministry of Health, has been downsized, and plans are underway to cut staffing levels even&#13;
further. This is coupled with a lack of management capacity. The ability of the MOH to supervise the&#13;
program effectively is in doubt. However, there is tremendous government commitment to health reform&#13;
and ARI/CDD programs and some very talented and dedicated people in the government health system.&#13;
The project design includes a phased implementation of the PHC Component to avoid excessive burden&#13;
on the MOH. Changing case management protocols is notoriously difficult, particularly at the tertiary&#13;
health facilities level. Unless case management at these Republican hospitals (the training ground for&#13;
future doctors) are improved, it will be difficult to make changes lower down the health system. Attempts&#13;
to integrate services will meet with strong opposition from health personnel at all levels of the health&#13;
system whose jobs are at stake.&#13;
H. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
44.   Three sets of indicators will be used to monitor the implementation of this subcomponent: input&#13;
indicators, process/output/service indicators, and outcome indicators. The data will be collected through&#13;
current reporting mechanisms and additional household (UNICEF survey) and health facility surveys. The&#13;
Technical Coordination Committee's Primary Health Care Coordinator and MOH can use the following&#13;
indicators to monitor the progress of the project. These can be converted into checklists and used on field&#13;
visits as spot checks. A more limited list of Performance Monitoring Indicators have been selected for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105                             ANNEX 2.B&#13;
the monitoring of the project by the World Bank.&#13;
45.   Input indicators will track planned resource inputs such as the following:&#13;
(a)    Person weeks of technical assistance per year&#13;
(b)    Procurement and disbursement of essential drugs to primary health care facilities.&#13;
46.   Process indicators will track the training activities:&#13;
(a)    Actual number of booklets printed compared with planned number&#13;
(b)    Number of workshops conducted&#13;
47.   Output indicators, focused on primary health providers who have received training and&#13;
the general public, will assess the unpact of the subcomponent on health services:&#13;
Acute Respiratory Infections:&#13;
(a)    Proportion of staff working with ARI cases who have been trained in WHO Case&#13;
Management&#13;
(b)    Proportion of health facilities receiving a regular supply of essential ARI drugs.&#13;
(c)    Proportion of ARI cases seen at the health facilities that have been correctly assessed.&#13;
(d)    Proportion of pneumonia cases seen at health facilities who will receive standard case&#13;
management of pneumonia.&#13;
(e)    Proportion of ARI patients seen at health facilities who should not receive antibiotics but&#13;
are given them.&#13;
(f)    Proportion of ARI cases without pneumonia who are hospitalized.&#13;
(g)    Proportion of caretakers of ARI patients who will receive advice on home treatment.&#13;
Diarrheal Diseases:&#13;
(a)    Proportion of staff working with diarrheal cases who have been trained in WHO Case&#13;
Management&#13;
(b)    Proportion of Model health facilities receiving a regular supply of essential drugs for&#13;
diarrheal diseases&#13;
(c)    Proportion of diarrhea cases seen at health facilities that will be correctly assessed.&#13;
(d)    Proportion of dysentery cases seen at health facilities who will receive standard case&#13;
management of dysentery.&#13;
(e)    Proportion of diarrhea patients seen at health facilities who should not receive antibiotics&#13;
but are given them.&#13;
(f)    Proportion of diarrhea cases without dehydration or other complications who are&#13;
hospitalized.&#13;
(g)    Proportion of caretakers of diarrhea patients who will receive advice on home treatment.&#13;
48.   Outcome indicators will track change in health status of the children. These are not expected&#13;
to change significantly in the four year life of the project. Changes occur only 5 to 6 years after the&#13;
implementation of a fully comprehensive ARI/CDD program.&#13;
(a)   Infant Mortality Rate&#13;
(b)    Under 2 and Under 5 Mortality Rate&#13;
(c)    Proportion of infant deaths due to acute respiratory tract diseases&#13;
(d)    Proportion of infant deaths due to diarrheal diseases&#13;
&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 2.C: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE - TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    A WHO analysis in March 1995 found the tuberculosis situation in the Kyrgyz Republic to be&#13;
grave. Even during the Soviet period, tuberculosis case notification rates were among the highest of the&#13;
whole USSR. More recently, after a few years of decline, case rates have increased by an average 3.9%&#13;
annually between 1989 and 1994, when 60 cases per 100,000 population were reported. In Bishkek city&#13;
this rate was 90.7 per 100.000 in 1994, i.e., similar to that of some of the most affected developing&#13;
countries. The largest proportion of cases still occurs in the young adult age groups, i.e., the most&#13;
productive segment of the population, and in 1994, over two thirds of all cases occurred in persons less&#13;
than 45 years of age. Using the very scarce data available from tuberculin surveys, 25 cases of smear&#13;
positive tuberculosis would occur annually in the Kyrgyz Republic. However, this estimate must be taken&#13;
with caution. Considering the poor attractiveness of the current Program, the fact that many patients may&#13;
not be diagnosed because of the current constraints, and the very high rate among the young adults, the&#13;
incidence of tuberculosis (all cases) in the Kyrgyz Republic may be higher than reported, i.e., up to 70&#13;
per 100,000.&#13;
2.    Mortality from tuberculosis has increased by an average 13.6% per year between 1988 and 1994,&#13;
when it was 13.6 per 100,000 population, i.e., the one of the highest in the whole Europe and the former&#13;
USSR. In Bishkek city the mortality rate was 29.7 per 100.000 in 1994. Because of reduced case finding&#13;
activities, the mortality rate could be much higher than reported. At present, it can be estimated that more&#13;
20% of all cases result in deaths; therefore, true tuberculosis mortality may be in the order of 15-20 per&#13;
100,000, if undiagnosed and untreated cases are included.&#13;
3.    In addition to this serious epidemiological situation, drug resistance levels, particularly to the most&#13;
important antituberculosis drugs, isoniazid and rifamnpicin, are reported to be on the increase from already&#13;
very high levels recorded in 1985-1987. This situation may even be worsening due to the current&#13;
inadequate treatment regimens and the increasing defaulting rate.&#13;
4.    The are two types of problems which are compromising the effectiveness of the Tuberculosis&#13;
Program. The first is that the economic crisis is affecting the budget for health, resulting in lack of drugs&#13;
and supplies. The second is that the existing well developed infrastructure is not utilized in a cost-&#13;
effective manner, as the policies of the National Tuberculosis Program are not in line with the recent&#13;
WHO strategy for global tuberculosis control, which is based on provision of short-course chemotherapy&#13;
to, at least, all sputum smear-positive cases.&#13;
5.    The analysis of the findings on TB control activities revealed a number of major problems. The&#13;
expensive and poor-yielding active screening of large proportions of the population by mass miniature&#13;
radiography is still being conducted, although to a limited extent due to lack of funds for maintenance&#13;
of the mobile van teams. Diagnosis is based on various tests and gives priority to chest radiography rather&#13;
than emphasizing smear microscopy. Tuberculosis patients are hospitalized for an excessive period of&#13;
time, although recently less than in the past due to lack of funds, and often kept in a convalescent status&#13;
in sanatoria for months. Patients are not treated with standard regimens, but drug combinations are often&#13;
individualized, also due to a serious lack of essential drugs; this results in low cure rates and the&#13;
production of chronic infectious cases, often infected with strains of M. tuberculosis resistant to drugs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114                            ANNEX 2.C&#13;
In addition, because of the weaknesses of the Program, defaulting rates are increasing rapidly, therefore&#13;
favoring continued transmission of tubercle bacilli in the community and onset of drug resistance. Finally,&#13;
WHO recommended recording and reporting systems are not in place; therefore, evaluation of treatment&#13;
cannot be accomplished.&#13;
6.    The WHO tuberculosis Program consultants made specific recommendations in order to have a&#13;
5-point policy package for effective tuberculosis control adopted by the Government. Discussions with&#13;
Dr A. Alisherov (Director of the National Tuberculosis Research Institute - NTRI) and Dr P.I. Limarev&#13;
(NTRI Chief Epidemiologist) during the October mission, as well as the recommendations from the First&#13;
Meeting of the National Tuberculosis Program Managers from the countries of Eastern Europe and the&#13;
former USSR held in Warsaw, Poland on 20-22 June 1994, resulted in the production of a document&#13;
adopting the WHO modern strategy of tuberculosis control in a cost-effective manner. This document,&#13;
already approved by the MOH, will be submitted for approval to the Cabinet of Ministers, showing the&#13;
commitment of the Program managers seriously to renovate the control strategy.&#13;
B. Role of Other Donors&#13;
7.    Despite the severity of this public health problem, no donor agency has undertaken any serious,&#13;
comprehensive and sustainable activity to help the National Program cope with the ongoing deterioration&#13;
of tuberculosis control.&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
8.    Tuberculosis control, according to the "World Development Report 1993" is among the most&#13;
cost-effective of all interventions. A new strategy of tuberculosis control in the Kyrgyz Republic may&#13;
indeed have a profound impact, as it will prevent deaths and disabilities among the most productive age&#13;
groups, and, at the same time, make more effective'use of scarce resources by simply reducing length&#13;
of hospitalization, number of beds, and other costly interventions.&#13;
D. The Sub-Component&#13;
9.    The overall goal of the sub-component is to improve the management of the tuberculosis control&#13;
program in the Kyrgyz Republic. The two specific objectives are:&#13;
(a)    To reduce the risk of tuberculosis transmission in the community and tuberculosis&#13;
morbidity and mortality. The project would aim at expanding and improving free, mostly&#13;
ambulatory, treatment with short course chemotherapy of patients with infectious&#13;
tuberculosis to achieve reduction of infection rate in the population of the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic.&#13;
(b)    To institute policy reforms and improve program management to achieve greater&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of tuberculosis control activities. The project would aim at&#13;
a better integration within the revitalized primary health system, at strengthening the&#13;
institution management and financing system, personnel and operational methods for&#13;
disease control, and at developing and disseminating cost-effective methods and materials&#13;
for improving control and sustaining the progress made.&#13;
10.   The project would revitalize the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) by providing support for&#13;
program implementation to the existing central (NTRI), oblast, and raion structures and to the primary&#13;
health care services countrywide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115                              ANNEX 2.C&#13;
11.   The tuberculosis control sub-component will consist of the following activities implemented during&#13;
the period 1996-2000.&#13;
(a)    Improvement and free provision of tuberculosis diagnostic services in at least one facility&#13;
per raion or city (be it a tuberculosis dispensary or a general health facility), and&#13;
upgrading of the quality of bacteriological services at raion and city level.&#13;
(b)    Provision of free short course chemotherapy and other treatment services to all&#13;
tuberculosis cases, with directly observed therapy during, at least, the initial phase of&#13;
chemotherapy, and achievement of high cure rates among all smear positive pulmonary&#13;
cases.&#13;
(c)    Improvement of case management by adoption of WHO recommended recording and&#13;
reporting system, and adequate supervision.&#13;
12.   Institutional strengthening of tuberculosis control will include the following:&#13;
(a)    Establishing, within the MOH, a formal NTP and under its leadership guarantee the&#13;
operational support to the three levels of tuberculosis care, i.e., the oblast, the raion/city&#13;
and the primary health care structure. The central unit of the NTP, based at the NTRI&#13;
should have adequate staff facilities and budgets to be responsible for formulating,&#13;
supervising and enforcing national tuberculosis control policies.&#13;
(b)    Reorganizing and upgrading the oblast level of the NTP within the oblast tuberculosis&#13;
Dispensary to plan, manage and supervise activities conducted within the oblast.&#13;
(c)    Reorganizing and upgrading the raion level of the NTP in each raion in order to plan,&#13;
manage and supervise control activities within the PHC system.&#13;
(d)    Implementing administrative, technical and financial reforms to improve the system by&#13;
which the central unit finances and manages control activities through the oblast level.&#13;
13.    The following investment and activities will be implemented in the Kyrgyz Republic during a 5-&#13;
year period of implementation (1996-2000). A detailed tuberculosis policy package of administrative and&#13;
technical reforms governing tuberculosis control activities has been agreed with the NTRI. Assurances&#13;
were obtained that the Kyrgyz MOH will guarantee that the tuberculosis policy package is implemented&#13;
stepwise in the country in all its terms and conditions, and maintain its provisions in effect for the full&#13;
project implementation period. The tuberculosis policy package constitutes the basis for the development&#13;
of a national manual for tuberculosis control. It addresses the main issues currently facing the Kyrgyz&#13;
control program and provides a basis from which rapid progress on tuberculosis control can be expected.&#13;
Its main features provide:&#13;
(a)    Chemotherapy for eligible patients and all case detection examinations, follow up, and&#13;
other procedures done by existing tuberculosis and PHC facilities, and supervision of&#13;
chemotherapy within hospitals or by feldshers and polyclinics, shall be free of charge to&#13;
the patient.&#13;
(b)    Only approved short course chemotherapy (SCC) regimens would be stocked and&#13;
prescribed by the raion tuberculosis coordinator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                               ANNEX 2.C&#13;
14.    Diagnostic services will rely on self referral by symptomatic cases (passive case finding).&#13;
However, health workers at all levels, and particularly, peripheral doctors and feldshers, will be&#13;
encouraged to actively identify suspected tuberculosis cases and refer them to the nearest raion facility&#13;
for confirmation of diagnosis. The project encourages reorganization of the diagnostic services by which&#13;
at each raion there is at least one facility (preferably a raion hospital, alternatively a tuberculosis&#13;
dispensary or a general health polyclinic) where a microscopy center and an X-ray unit are&#13;
accommodated. These facilities should be supervised for their tuberculosis component by the raion&#13;
coordinator who should, therefore, be based ideally at the central raion hospital. Each microscopy center&#13;
will have at least one binocular microscope for rapid and reliable screening of stained sputum smears.&#13;
In raions where distances or population densities are such that reliance on one single facility for diagnosis&#13;
is inappropriate, additional diagnostic services located at polyclinics or ambulatories must be available.&#13;
15.    Chest radiography examination will be provided to all persons with symptoms suggestive of&#13;
tuberculosis referred by doctors or feldshers at the designated raion facility (a general hospital or a&#13;
tuberculosis dispensary, if available) capable of accommodating the X-ray unit and the microscopy center.&#13;
Patients with abnormal films will have at least three sputum specimens examined for tubercle bacilli. For&#13;
patients living in distant parts of the raion, a brief 6-7 day hospitalization may be necessary to complete&#13;
the diagnostic screening and make the decision on treatment. Procedures to be followed for diagnosis will&#13;
be based on clear instructions. In brief, patients with abnormal chest X-ray and positive sputum smears&#13;
will be considered tuberculosis cases and treated accordingly. Those with abnormal chest X-ray and&#13;
negative sputum will be reviewed by a doctor of the facility where the diagnostic screening was done&#13;
(preferably a tuberculosis specialist or a physician who has been trained on tuberculosis) and a decision&#13;
on treatment will be made; in these cases, sputum cultures should be obtained. Those with negative chest&#13;
X- ray will receive broad spectrum antibiotics and be discharged to their referring health care worker for&#13;
reevaluation. Naturally, as treatment decisions will depend largely on primary health care doctors,&#13;
adequate training will be required by the tuberculosis specialists available in the Raion. It would be&#13;
preferable if, during the process of primary health care reorganization, tuberculosis specialists are&#13;
designated to work in primary health care facilities or at general hospitals, so that a specialist is present&#13;
for rapid consultation in each institution where decisions on treatment are made.&#13;
16.    About 30,000 chest X-ray films and about 350,000 smears are expected to be required. As&#13;
radiographic screening to rule-out tuberculosis will be performed within primary health care facilities,&#13;
cost of films should be covered by the primary care structure, except in those cases where tuberculosis&#13;
is confirmed (in such instances, the project will cover the cost of the initial film and of a second one&#13;
when this is necessary). The project provides appropriate equipment (about 170 binocular microscopes,&#13;
1 fluorescent microscopes and other essential laboratory equipment), along with ancillary supplies for&#13;
microscopy (containers, slides, and stains), and radiography (X-ray films). Training for PHC doctors&#13;
and feldshers to recognize and refer tuberculosis symptomatics will be provided by the raion tuberculosis&#13;
coordinators.&#13;
17.    Chemotherapy:         The primary target of the tuberculosis component is the achievement of&#13;
high cure rates (usually more than 85%), as rapid case detection and sputum conversions of infectious&#13;
cases are the best means for prevention of tuberculosis transmission. The cure rate indicates not only the&#13;
proportion of cases who convert to negative sputum smear, but also the proportion of those who remain&#13;
sources of infection. Since the lives of patients not cured are prolonged by inadequate treatment over the&#13;
expected survival of untreated cases, their cumulative number increases the pool of infectious cases. In&#13;
addition, inadequate treatment is likely to produce drug resistant strains and their spread. Therefore, the&#13;
main target of tuberculosis control is to reduce drastically the sputum smear positive sources of infection.&#13;
In order to achieve this target, specific technical criteria must be strictly followed. In brief, regimens&#13;
must be adequate, and standardized according to specific patient categories. In addition, chemotherapy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
117                               ANNEX 2.C&#13;
must be supervised, i.e., drug intake must be directly observed by the administering doctor, feldsher or&#13;
nurse, at least during the 2-month initial phase of treatment. Treatment will be mostly on an ambulatory&#13;
basis, although hospitalization may be necessary for advanced and severe forms of tuberculosis. A final&#13;
decision on treatment modality (fully ambulatory vs. hospitalization for the initial phase) will be made&#13;
only after analysis of results from pilot projects. Finally, to facilitate drug administration, to improve&#13;
patient compliance, especially during the continuation phase, and to protect against the onset of drug&#13;
resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, drug combinations are essential. The project would provide for the&#13;
purchase and distribution of the five basic drugs required. Drug types and dosages have been estimated.&#13;
18.    Monitoring of treatment results is indispensable to evaluate efficacy of chemotherapy. This is&#13;
accomplished by regular sputum smear microscopy at the end of the initial phase of treatment, and at least&#13;
twice during the continuation phase, of which one at the end of it. Therefore, an additional 6 sputum&#13;
smears per patients enrolled, i.e., about 50.000 sputum smears, will be done. Treatment results will be&#13;
monitored utilizing cohort analysis of all enrolled patients based on six clearly defined categories of&#13;
treatment outcomes.&#13;
19.    Case management: The revitalized NTP will adopt and maintain a standard WHO recommended&#13;
recording and reporting system. This include the following forms: tuberculosis raion register, laboratory&#13;
register, tuberculosis treatment card, request for sputum examination, and quarterly and yearly reports.&#13;
These forms will be approved by the MOH. Translation and printing of the forms will be supported by&#13;
the project.&#13;
20.    Financial Incentives:  The government should approve and introduce a system of financial&#13;
incentives for case detection and cure of tuberculosis patients. Funds can be derived from the savings&#13;
resulting from ambulatory treatment and abandoning previous expensive practices. Key elements for&#13;
incentives will be:&#13;
(a)    A 30 som payment to any health worker who originally refers tuberculosis suspects for&#13;
examination, if the diagnosis of tuberculosis is confirmed by microscopy.&#13;
(b)    Primary health workers who manage a tuberculosis case will be paid 60 soms at the end&#13;
of treatment of a smear-positive patient in whom cure is documented. Health workers&#13;
will be paid 30 soms for the management of smear negative patients after treatment&#13;
completion. These additional payments, as well as the regular salaries, will be ensured&#13;
by the Government and paid by the raion health administration on a regular basis. If&#13;
drug administration is not fully supervised in the initial phase, as shown by the treatment&#13;
cards and registry, payment will not be made. Payment will not be made to the&#13;
tuberculosis facilities staff and to hospital staff managing hospitalized patients.&#13;
21.    All oblasts implementing the new program will adopt the standard registry and forms at the&#13;
beginning of the project. The registry will make it possible to identify raions with lower than average case&#13;
detection rates and low proportion of bacteriologically confirmed cases. This will allow the oblast&#13;
supervisors and the central unit to target management efforts and training to improve the situation. It will&#13;
allow the oblast tuberculosis coordinator to monitor and evaluate treatment results in each raion and to&#13;
identify those who need additional training and supervision. These registry, forms and reports will&#13;
provide the most important tool for program supervision and monitoring.&#13;
22.   Institutional strengthening:  Selected staff at the NTRI have been historically responsible for&#13;
control activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. The MOH will need to formalize the establishment of a central&#13;
unit responsible for planning of the operational steps in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118                                ANNEX 2.C&#13;
NTP; for coordination of the NTP at Oblast level, Raion level, and primary health care level; for&#13;
purchase and distribution of the needed supplies, especially antituberculosis drugs, laboratory equipment&#13;
and stains, forms, registers, manuals, and other materials; and for training of the personnel involved in&#13;
the NTP. The MOH will guarantee that it will maintain the central unit with facilities, budgets, functions&#13;
and staffing ensuring implementation and sustainability of the project. The staff for the Central unit&#13;
should consist of at least: I director, 1 supervisor, I person responsible for drug supply, and 1 training&#13;
coordinator. Computer and printer, their maintenance and a course on computer use for 4 persons will&#13;
be covered in order to provide adequate management skills. Eight photocopy machines and 8 telefax&#13;
machines for NTRI and the oblast coordinators will be provided to allow rapid flow of information. The&#13;
clinical staff of the NTRI should consist of the necessary number of clinicians to cover a rationalized&#13;
number of beds, which should be reserved to serious or difficult-to-treat cases.&#13;
23.    Within, the central unit, the Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) should consist of:   I&#13;
Bacteriologist responsible for supervision of Oblast and Raion mycobacteriology laboratories (2&#13;
laboratories should be visited every month), 1 Microbiologist, I Senior Technician, 2 microscopists and&#13;
1 technician for culture and drug susceptibility testing. The CRL will be primarily responsible to&#13;
supervise the network of microscopy services and to train oblast dispensary laboratory technicians. The&#13;
second priority of the CRL should be to determine reliable primary and acquired resistance patterns in&#13;
the country, which constitute a valid indicator of treatment efficacy. This surveillance of drug resistance&#13;
should be done on a representative sample of smear positive cases.&#13;
24.    The Oblast unit, based at the Oblast Tuberculosis Dispensary, is responsible for coordination of&#13;
control activities in the whole Oblast and supervision of personnel with visits to each Raion/City every&#13;
two months; for organizing training programs for staff in Raions/Cities; ensuring that quarterly reports&#13;
on case-finding and treatment outcomes are carefully prepared in each Raion/City and sent to the Oblast&#13;
level; for acquisition and distribution of needed supplies and for coordination of the tuberculosis activities&#13;
with the primary care level. Once the NTP is fully implemented, the staff of the Oblast unit should&#13;
consist of at least: 1 director, 1 supervisor, 1 officer responsible for training, statistical and&#13;
epidemiological analyses, coordination of supplies, and financial matters. The clinical staff of the Oblast&#13;
Tuberculosis Dispensary and/or hospital should consist of the necessary number of clinicians to cover a&#13;
rationalized number of beds. The Oblast Laboratory should consist of: I Microbiologist, 1 Senior&#13;
Technician, and 1 microscopist. The oblast laboratory will be primarily responsible to supervise the&#13;
network of microscopy services and to train raion laboratory technicians involved with smear microscopy.&#13;
Oblast laboratories will be responsible for culture examination of smear negative patients.&#13;
25.    The Raion/City unit is responsible for implementing the NTP at the Raion or City level through&#13;
the staff of the primary health care facilities; for supervision of treatment ensuring that recommended&#13;
regimens are prescribed, that patients on the initial phase of treatment are closely supervised, that&#13;
regimens are given for the required period, that patients completing treatment are discharged from&#13;
treatment, and that sputum smears are examined at the given intervals; for supervision of the Raion or&#13;
City tuberculosis register; and for the procurement of the necessary supplies for the Raion or the City.&#13;
The staff for the Raion or City unit should consist of one raion tuberculosis coordinator, also responsible&#13;
for training, statistical and epidemiological analyses, coordination of supplies, and financial matters. As&#13;
the number of patients expected per raion does not justify the maintenance of a specific tuberculosis&#13;
laboratory, microscopy services within the raion should be accommodated into general polyclinics or&#13;
hospitals. The Raion or City Laboratory should consist of at least 1 laboratory technician trained in smear&#13;
microscopy.&#13;
26.    Health education: Patient's commitment to adherence to and completion of chemotherapy is&#13;
essential. Therefore, some health education material needs to prepared, tested and disseminated for this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
119                             ANNEX 2.C&#13;
purpose. Some should aim at patients and their families, some at health care workers. The NTRI will be&#13;
responsible for the development and testing through the primary health care network.&#13;
27.   Program supervision: Regular, frequent supervision of each level of the program will be critical&#13;
to ensure implementation of the project component, particularly regarding the appropriate use of the new&#13;
registry system, to ensure improved diagnosis, chemotherapy and case management. Central, oblast and&#13;
raion supervisors must be mobile and have adequate operating budgets. One vehicle for the NTRI and&#13;
transportation costs in fuel for all supervisors will be provided. It is estimated that staff from the NTRI&#13;
will visit each Oblast quarterly; staff from Oblast level will visit each Raion monthly; and raion&#13;
coordinators will visit primary health care facilities where patients are diagnosed and treated on a constant&#13;
basis. Cost of regular national and oblast management meetings should be provided by the GOK.&#13;
28.   Training and Technical assistance: Training and technical assistance will be crucial for staff at&#13;
all levels to successfully adopt modern supervised, short course chemotherapy and the new policy.&#13;
Beginning in late 1995 two pilot projects in selected raions will start to evaluate the operational aspects&#13;
of the new program. These raions will form the core national training field base for future project&#13;
implementation. Basic training equipment will be provided for the raions selected for the pilot projects&#13;
and, later, for the whole country. The cost of conducting the training programs (central and oblast&#13;
managers - one course every other year; oblast and raion/city staff - seven courses, one per oblast every&#13;
other year; for PHC workers - two brief courses per raion every year; laboratory personnel at central and&#13;
oblast level - one course every other year; peripheral laboratory personnel - one course in each oblast&#13;
every year), and of the materials used will be covered by the project. The raion coordinator should&#13;
maintain close relationship with primary health care workers and ensure continuous education on&#13;
tuberculosis control. External consultants to assist and help in the national training courses will be&#13;
necessary.&#13;
29.    Project management: Technical guidance and supervision of the project will be provided by the&#13;
NTRI. The creation of the new Programn will imply some reorganization of the NTRI staff activities and&#13;
training. However, it should not require hiring of new staff. The recent development of a framework&#13;
for effective tuberculosis control adapted from the WHO document by the director of NTRI reflects the&#13;
commnitment to revitalize the NTP and the approval of pilot projects confirms this commitment. While&#13;
the MOH has already approved the new frarnework for tuberculosis control, the GOK is expected to adopt&#13;
the new WHO strategy before initiation of the project.   At oblast level, technical guidance and&#13;
supervision will be provided by the oblast tuberculosis coordinators. As the tuberculosis component will&#13;
depend on proper case management by primary health care workers, the strengthening of primary health&#13;
care of the Kyrgyz Republic will need to include adequate training and support related to tuberculosis&#13;
activities. In addition, as incentives will be provided to PHC workers for diagnosing and curing&#13;
tuberculosis cases, financial management reforms should include the mechanism of payment of incentives.&#13;
The GOK will bear a considerable supervision load for the project in terms of staff training and support.&#13;
External monitoring of the project will require a consultant to visit the country twice a year for the entire&#13;
duration of the project. A supervision input of the WHO tuberculosis Program is planned for about 4-6&#13;
staff weeks per year.&#13;
Benefits and Risks&#13;
30.   Benefits: There will be various types of benefits: disease transmission benefits and illnessideath&#13;
avoided benefits. They will result from rapid reduction in the pool of previously treated smear-positive&#13;
cases, and more rapid treatment and cure of new smear positive cases, and, as a consequence, from a&#13;
decrease in infection rate, resulting in permanently lowered incidence rates. The project would increase&#13;
the cure rate to over 85 % of newly treated infectious cases and improve the case detection rate to at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120                              ANNEX 2.C&#13;
70%. In epidemiological terms, the benefits should be a rapid reduction of tuberculosis prevalence by 50-&#13;
60% from current levels and a, at lest, 5% yearly decline in the annual risk of tuberculosis infection. In&#13;
addition, mortality from tuberculosis will sharply decline within as short a period of one or two years.&#13;
Eventually a decline of the annual number of new cases due to reduced transmission of tubercle bacilli&#13;
in the community will follow. Thus, enormous benefits could be achieved in a relatively short period of&#13;
time, considering that the health infrastructure is still largely in existence. However, further delays in&#13;
addressing this key health issue would definitely impact on future efforts of control, particularly if a high&#13;
number of chronic cases resistant to drugs are produced.&#13;
31.    By the end of the project, a few thousand people will be saved from premature deaths due to&#13;
tuberculosis and thousands of new infectious cases will be prevented. Patients, their families and&#13;
communities will directly benefit from avoidance of illness costs, disability and from preservation of&#13;
productive capacity. In addition, long term benefits can be expected for the next several years as incident&#13;
cases will start to decrease significantly.&#13;
32.    Finally, since hard-to-justify numbers of facilities and beds dedicated to tuberculosis control are&#13;
available in the Kyrgyz Republic, the project will, by its accompanying changes, rationalize the number&#13;
of beds and reduce the number of facilities.&#13;
33.    Risks: If implemented as conceived and designed, risks of this project component are small.&#13;
However, strong guidance from the central unit to oblast and raion units is necessary to ensure that the&#13;
new control strategy is strictly implemented. In fact, the main risk is that the lower levels of the Program&#13;
will persist with old technical practices emphasizing case finding rather than focusing on the achievement&#13;
of high cure rates. This may result from an ineffective adoption of the new strategy of diagnosis,&#13;
treatment and monitoring, and from defective implementation of the new policy changes. To help guard&#13;
against these risks, the government must guarantee that financial and technical policy changes are&#13;
adequately implemented at all levels.&#13;
34.    Another major risk, linked with the difficult transition phase of the Kyrgyz economy and political&#13;
system, could be the failure by the GOK to provide salaries for the officers involved with tuberculosis&#13;
control at various levels and the failure to introduce and sustain incentives for primary health care&#13;
workers diagnosing and treating tuberculosis cases. Government commitment on this issue is essential.&#13;
35.    As the new tuberculosis control strategy relies on adequate organization and structure of the&#13;
revitalized primary health care system, a failure or delay in implementing such a system will negatively&#13;
impact on efforts to successfully shift from hospital based-treatment to fully ambulatory treatment. In&#13;
addition, lack of training of general practitioners on tuberculosis control may endanger the project&#13;
effectiveness to diagnose cases. This can be addressed by the inclusion of tuberculosis in the educational&#13;
curriculum of primary health care workers, as well as by the reallocation of tuberculosis specialists within&#13;
primary health care facilities to guarantee adequate assistance to general practitioners during the initial&#13;
years of the project.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
36.    Detailed reporting forms for monitoring of project progress and criteria to be used following&#13;
WHO recommendations have been agreed with the NTRI. Indicators for measuring progress towards&#13;
project implementation are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121                             ANNEX 2.C&#13;
37.   Indicators for measuring progress towards project development objectives&#13;
(i)    Achievement of an organizational structure of the program  based on the WHO&#13;
recommendations (central, oblast, raion, and phc);&#13;
(ii)   Production of a project protocol reflecting the WHO strategy for tuberculosis control&#13;
from which a national manual will be eventually obtained;&#13;
(iii)   Rationalized use of beds for tuberculosis;&#13;
(iv)   Number of trained staff at all levels (4 at central level, 3 per each oblast, 1 per each&#13;
raion). Trained staff will be aware of the new tuberculosis control strategy, be able to&#13;
supervise staff, set objectives, develop work-plans, prepare quarterly reports, and will&#13;
be able to identify and correct management problems.&#13;
38.   Indicators of Program Management: The maintenance of accurate records on each individual&#13;
patient, and periodic reporting is essential to the good management of the NTP at each level.&#13;
(i)    Recording: Data collected should give as true a picture as possible of what is actually&#13;
happening in the program of diagnosing and treating. The data should be reliable,&#13;
relevant, and uniform. To achieve this a standard set of documents and reports will be&#13;
used in all units involved in the sub-component. These are attached and shall not be&#13;
modified by the Kyrgyz in any way.&#13;
(ii)    Reporting: Reports on case finding and treatment results will be reported from the Raion&#13;
or City TB coordinator to the Central Unit via the Oblast TB coordinator. Three forms&#13;
(attached) to be used are:&#13;
(a)    Quarterly report on new cases and relapses of tuberculosis;&#13;
(b)    Quarterly report on the results of treatment of the patients registered 12 - 15&#13;
months earlier;&#13;
(c)    Quarterly report on Program management.&#13;
These three fonns will be completed by each Raion or City TB coordinator, checked by&#13;
the Oblast coordinator and submitted to the Central Unit where the results will be&#13;
computerized for easy retrieval and production of analytical reports.&#13;
39.   These indicators will be verified respectively by the following means:&#13;
(i)   training course participation and trainers' feed-back;&#13;
(ii)   site visits and progress reports by WHO consultants (twice a year);&#13;
(iii)   assessment of the quality of documents produced;&#13;
(iv)   surveillance data sent to WHO;&#13;
(v)    cohort analysis reports sent to WHO.&#13;
40.   Progress indicators will clearly show whether and where project objectives are being achieved.&#13;
A quarterly report system will allow to assess the progress of case finding and treatment results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122                             ANNEX 2.C&#13;
41.   Loan covenants requiring special attention. To ensure success of the project there must be&#13;
commitment by the GOK to approve the following conditions:&#13;
(a)    Formalization of the proposed three-level structure of the revitalized National&#13;
Tuberculosis Program (central, oblast, raion) and approval of the policy package for&#13;
tuberculosis control prepared by the NTRI based on the following 5 elements;&#13;
(i)    The Kyrgyz Government must be committed to a National Tuberculosis Program&#13;
aiming at a nation-wide coverage, as a permanent health system activity, better&#13;
integrated into the existing primary health structure with technical leadership&#13;
from a strong central unit based at the National Tuberculosis Research Institute&#13;
in Bishkek. The structure should be appropriate to the country health system and&#13;
guarantee rational utilization of existing health services;&#13;
(ii)    Case detection through predominantly passive case-finding (i.e., detection of&#13;
cases which spontaneously present at the health services) ensuring that 3 smears&#13;
are obtained from every patient with radiologic abnormalities;&#13;
(iii)   Standardized case definitions of all tuberculosis cases, with supervised&#13;
administration of short-course chemotherapy in, at least, the initial phase for all&#13;
smear-positive cases;&#13;
(iv)   A system of regular drug supply and adequate stocks of drugs at each level&#13;
(Central, Oblast, Raion);&#13;
(v)    A standardized recording and reporting system for monitoring case detection and&#13;
treatment outcomes.&#13;
(b)    In order to ensure adequate case management of tuberculosis patients through the primary&#13;
health care system, the government should introduce a system of financial incentives for&#13;
case detection and cure of tuberculosis patients utilizing its own resources (part of them&#13;
could be derived from savings resulting from ambulatory treatment and abandoning of&#13;
previous expensive services). Elements of this system are:&#13;
(i)    A 30 som payment to any health worker who originally refers tuberculosis&#13;
suspects for examination, if the diagnosis of tuberculosis is confirmed by&#13;
microscopy.&#13;
(ii)   Primary health workers who manage a tuberculosis case will be paid 60 soms at&#13;
the end of treatment of a smear-positive patient in whom cure is documented.&#13;
Health workers will be paid 30 soms for the management of smear negative&#13;
patients after treatment completion. These additional payments, as well as the&#13;
regular salaries, will be ensured by the Government and paid by the raion health&#13;
administration on a regular basis. If drug admninistration is not fully supervised&#13;
in the initial phase, as shown by the treatment cards and registry, payment will&#13;
not be made. Payment will not be made to the tuberculosis facilities staff and to&#13;
hospital staff managing hospitalized patients.&#13;
(c)    As the case detection and treatment of tuberculosis patients will become the responsibility&#13;
of primary health care workers, the GOK should consider reallocating current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
123                             ANNEX 2.C&#13;
tuberculosis specialists from tuberculosis in-patient facilities to primary health care&#13;
facilities. It will be desirable to have in each facility where major decisions are made on&#13;
diagnosis and treatment (Raion hospital and/or polyclinic) a tuberculosis specialist who&#13;
could train and assist primary health care physicians until they acquire adequate&#13;
knowledge on tuberculosis case management. It is essential that tuberculosis be&#13;
established as a major topic in the educational curriculum of a primary health care&#13;
physician and/or feldsher, in view of the larger role they will have in tuberculosis case&#13;
management. These conditions should be met in order to safely shift from a vertical&#13;
tuberculosis control program to the one integrated into the primary health care.&#13;
(d)    As ambulatory care seems an adequate and cost-effective manner to provide tuberculosis&#13;
treatment, two pilot projects before countrywide program implementation should be&#13;
established to evaluate the feasibility of providing ambulatory treatment during the initial&#13;
phase of chemotherapy through the primary health care system, as compared to drug&#13;
administration through hospitalization of all patients. The GOK should be committed to&#13;
approve fully ambulatory treatment of tuberculosis, if results of the pilot projects&#13;
demonstrate similarity of treatment outcomes. In addition, the GOK should limit the&#13;
provision of antituberculosis drugs to the raion coordinators or to institutions directly&#13;
involved with the tuberculosis program.&#13;
(e)    Study protocols similar to that for pilot project should be prepared by NTRI with the&#13;
assistance of WHO, and, translated in Russian should be ready by the project&#13;
effectiveness. All necessary documentation, i.e., treatment cards, registers, and forms&#13;
should be reproduced and distributed to the areas proposed for implementation in the year&#13;
1.&#13;
42.   ImDlementation plan: The first step towards implementation of the project is government's&#13;
agreement on the proposed framework for tuberculosis control and on the commitment to support the&#13;
project. As it is essential to define the operational problems which might arise from a completely new&#13;
approach to tuberculosis control, pilot projects are necessary which implement the new strategy of&#13;
tuberculosis control. Two 1-year pilot projects covering each between 100.000 and 150.000 population&#13;
have been established. Both these projects, expected to cover up to 200 patients in one year, would call&#13;
for better integration within the existing primary health care system regarding diagnostic procedures and&#13;
provision of treatment. One project will evaluate treatment results hospitalizing patients during the initial&#13;
phase of chemotherapy, whereas the other will assess the feasibility of fully ambulatory treatment through&#13;
primary health care providers. Funding for these projects has been obtained from a separate World Bank&#13;
grant. These pilot projects began in November, 1995. In order to ensure adequate methodology, pilot&#13;
project principal coordinators from NTRI were trained on the modem strategy of tuberculosis control&#13;
during the International Training Course held at the WHO Collaborating Center in Warsaw, Poland on&#13;
24-29 April 1995. Travel and accommodation costs were covered by WHO. The training course for&#13;
selected raion coordinators involved in the pilot project was held in Bishkek in September 1995. The&#13;
Central Reference Laboratory Coordinator was retrained in smear-microscopy during a course organized&#13;
by WHO in Tbilisi, Georgia in June 1995. In September 1995 the training course in smear-microscopy&#13;
for raion laboratory technicians was established in Bishkek. Training tools consisting of standard WHO&#13;
training modules translated in Russian, WHO treatment guidelines and laboratory manual in Russian were&#13;
provided by WHO. A protocol for a pilot project of tuberculosis control programs was prepared by the&#13;
NTRI with the assistance of WHO. This protocol translated in Russian and reproduced, was distributed&#13;
among the pilot project raions TB coordinators. Registers, treatment cards and report forms were&#13;
translated in Russian and distributed. Drugs and necessary laboratory equipment were purchased and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

stocked by the project coordinators, and will be disbursed gradually during the entire period of pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
43.   The results of the pilot projects, as well as the progress of implementation of the new primary&#13;
health care system, will guide the final choice of diagnostic and treatment policies for the nationwide&#13;
World Bank assisted project. A detailed project manual will be produced by the central unit with the&#13;
assistance of WHO. In the first year of the project the oblast of Issyk-kul and Chui and the city of&#13;
Bishkek will be covered. Before implementation of the full project, a number of training courses will be&#13;
held. Training tools tested during the pilot projects will be reproduced and distributed. Training of&#13;
primary health care workers must be particularly intensive in order for them to become acquainted with&#13;
tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment. In addition, as the decision of enrolment of a patient for treatment&#13;
will become responsibility of primary health care workers, consideration should be made to reallocate&#13;
current tuberculosis specialists from tuberculosis in-patient facilities to primary health care. Diagnostic&#13;
services will be upgraded with necessary equipment and provided with necessary supplies. Procurement&#13;
and distribution of those will be coordinated by the central unit. The necessary drugs will be purchased&#13;
and stocked by the project coordinator according to the expected number of cases in each area. Based on&#13;
the progress of the initial implementation steps, the project will be expanded to the oblast of Naryn and&#13;
Talas during year 2 and to the rest of the country during year 3.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3: FACILITIES REHABILITATION COMPONENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    The extent and content of facilities in a health infrastructure directly influence quality and&#13;
efficiency, and thereby the recurrent expenditure required in the health sector. The need for staff, their&#13;
production capacity, the need for consumables and supplies, maintenance services and energy can all be&#13;
measured in relationship to the buildings in which services are provided.&#13;
2.    At present an intense re-evaluation is being made in the Kyrgyz Republic, of the goals,&#13;
capabilities and responsibilities of the health as well as other public sectors. In particular attempts are&#13;
being made to address the consequences of the present drastic reduction in available resources. It was&#13;
therefore that the World Bank in the process of preparing a broad reaching health sector rehabilitation&#13;
project, included an evaluation of the physical and functional condition of health facilities and equipment,&#13;
and the frame-work within which the health infrastructure is financed and managed&#13;
3.    Four missions were undertaken in the periods between 3rd and 19th October 1994, 22nd February&#13;
to 10th March, 18th June to 11th July and 15th to 31st October 1995. During these missions meetings&#13;
were held in Bishkek with senior officers in the Ministry of Health, in particular those dealing with the&#13;
provision of health services, and the management of capital investment. Further meetings were held with&#13;
leading experts on architecture, capital projects management and equipment procurement.&#13;
4.    In the October 1994 mission visits were made to the Diagnostic Center, the National TB Institute&#13;
and the National Dermatology and STD Institute in Bishkek, the Raion Hospital at Kochkor, and various&#13;
facilities in the Naryn Oblast including the central hospital, the TB center, the Mental Diseases hospital&#13;
and the Dermatology and STD clinic.&#13;
5.    In the February and June 1995 missions, health facility sites in the Chui Oblast where emphasis&#13;
was made on visiting primary health care facilities including raion hospitals, rural hospitals, ambulatory&#13;
care centers and feldsher/midwife posts (FAP's)&#13;
6.    The following is a report based on those meetings and visits.&#13;
Summary of Findings&#13;
7.    In visiting a number of all types of health institutions in the Kyrgyz republic, the following main&#13;
problems are apparent:&#13;
(i)    The government is no longer making adequate funds available to pay for running and&#13;
maintaining buildings, plant and equipment in the health sector, and therefore correct&#13;
levels of efficiency and quality within the system are becoming increasingly difficult to&#13;
maintain&#13;
(ii)    A large amount of equipment is not working due to shortages of spare parts and lack of&#13;
servicing. Further important consumables are in short supply or are not available. These&#13;
factors seriously detract from the efficiency of the health delivery system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148                                ANNEX 3&#13;
(iii)    The present over-provision of health facilities and equipment (working or not working)&#13;
at all levels, implies that correct financing of their use will require resources which at&#13;
present are not available&#13;
(iv)    Any introduction of new health programs aimed at improving efficiency in the provision&#13;
of services will often imply changes in the use of existing facilities, in some cases also&#13;
implying changes to the facilities themselves.&#13;
(v)    Very few norms and standards for health facilities have been formulated which relate to&#13;
the present situation.&#13;
(vi)    Administrators of health facilities are not well trained in estates management. They are&#13;
given very little support when introducing technical changes to their buildings and plant&#13;
(such as installing new heating systems, or when implementing changes or trying to&#13;
achieve savings.&#13;
(vii)   Though originally there was apparently a well functioning hierarchy of technical and&#13;
administrative expertise available to support MOH capital investment activities, including&#13;
MOH staff and sister ministry's architects, engineers and builders, this is no longer easy&#13;
to assemble. Further, although the Ministry of Health's office for Capital Investments is&#13;
still operating, though with a negligible work-load, the Ministry's Central Office for&#13;
Maintenance has been completely disbanded.&#13;
(viii)  The Ministry of Health has no overview of the buildings, plant estates etc, which&#13;
constitute the health service infrastructure. It is not able to make overall plans and&#13;
priorities for realignment activities.&#13;
8.     Where improvements are required to the efficiency and quality of health services provided in the&#13;
country in the existing health infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for the Ministry to implement the&#13;
changes required which will facilitate these.&#13;
9.     A significant reorganization is required within the Ministry of Health in order to re-orientate&#13;
present technical expertise on the repair, rehabilitation and reutilization of existing structures and plant.&#13;
That is to say to move away for the development of completely new and totally unnecessary capital&#13;
investment projects.&#13;
10.    In this new concept the Ministry will require tools to create an adequate organization, to collect&#13;
the necessary information and to implement the correct policies. It is suggested that the World Bank&#13;
project, through implementing limited constructional works in connection with the implementation of its&#13;
health reform project, could contribute significantly to helping the Ministry to develop these tools.&#13;
B. Background&#13;
11.    The health service system in the Kyrgyz republic is based on a very comprehensive infra-structure&#13;
of health facilities at all levels, which in spite of the country's difficult topological characteristics,&#13;
provides good access to the system for most members of the population.&#13;
12.    The health facilities include central hospitals, district hospitals, polyclinics, feldsher/midwife&#13;
stations, village ambulatory stations, as well as special separate institutions for tuberculosis,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
149                              ANNEX 3&#13;
dermatology/sexually transmitted diseases. Together they provide a very wide range of services for both&#13;
out patients and in-patients, with an extensive portfolio of medical equipment and a large total of beds&#13;
Quality of the Health Infrastructure&#13;
13.   Usually planned on large open sites, the facilities making up the health infrastructure are generally&#13;
of very substantial construction with thick masonry walls both internally and externally and with heavy&#13;
reinforced concrete floors. Carpentry- and joinery work is also generally very substantially dimensioned,&#13;
though electrical and plumbing installations are usually of poor quality and less than adequate in terms&#13;
of the numbers and quality of installations and fittings.&#13;
14.   Generally the buildings reflect the quality of provision found in all other public buildings in the&#13;
country and no attempt has been made to pinch and save. However it is considered surprising that in an&#13;
environment with relatively extreme temperatures, passive means of energy conservation through the&#13;
improvement of insulation, -particularly in floors, ceilings and roofs, do not seem to have been given&#13;
very much attention&#13;
Central Health Institutes&#13;
15.   The central health institutes located in Bishkek, as typified by the Diagnostic Center and the&#13;
National Tuberculosis Center appear openly to have been establish on a 'no expense spared' concept.&#13;
These buildings are very impressive, in the case of the TB institute, almost flamboyant. There have&#13;
apparently been several approaches from different governments with a view to purchasing the hospital&#13;
to convert into an Embassy.&#13;
16.   Though still apparently functioning satisfactorily, there is evidence that both these institutes are&#13;
beginning to deteriorate functionally through a lack of routine maintenance and absence of spare parts.&#13;
The initial solution here is the injection of large amounts of finance which obviously is not available,&#13;
before the whole financing of the sector has been reorganized.&#13;
17.   It could also be relevant to encourage these institutes to pool the technical expertise that they&#13;
individually have access to and at the same time to carefully evaluate the appropriateness of the&#13;
technology that they use. It is suggested that any infusion of capital in present conditions would not&#13;
achieve any sustainable improvements.&#13;
Hospitals&#13;
18.   The hospitals are usually made up of a large number of individual departments. A relatively small&#13;
hospital with less than 400 beds, usually has separate self-contained departments for Urology, Pulmonary&#13;
/gastroenterology, Surgery, Trauma, Resuscitation, Ophthalmology, Paediatrics, Cardiology, Infectious&#13;
diseases.&#13;
19.   On the same site there is also usually a polyclinic containing units reflecting all these departmnents,&#13;
as well as a multi-disciplinary veterans hospital. On separate sites will often be located independent&#13;
institutions for obstetrics and gynecology, TB, dermatology and STD and psychiatric patients.&#13;
20.   It is suggested that this ensconcement of the departments in independent units does not easily&#13;
support modem coordinated nursing and treatment methods. It is also noted that there is very little cross-&#13;
utilization of equipment and facilities between departments, even when they are located in the same&#13;
building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
150                              ANNEX 3&#13;
21.    Generally space standards in hospitals are low and the rooms in the buildings are small in&#13;
relationship to the activities which go on there.&#13;
22.    Operating theater rooms are usually adequate in size, though many of the necessary secondary&#13;
rooms such as utility rooms, sterile set up rooms, duty rooms and change rooms for staff are missing.&#13;
23.    In the ward sections, rooms for in-patients often contain 8-9 beds, where there is only reasonable&#13;
space for 4-6 beds, and often other important rooms, (such as utility rooms, ward stores, patients and&#13;
staff toilets, bath rooms, staff duty rooms and patient day rooms) are either under-dimensioned or&#13;
missing.&#13;
Rural Hospitals&#13;
24.    There appears to be two distinct types of rural hospitals in the regions visited. One is the&#13;
'Blenheim Palace' type of building, with very heavy two story structure with often very elaborate&#13;
ornamentation in the form of columns, porticos and plinths. Usually containing as few as 30 in-patient&#13;
beds they are very inflexible in use. They are also very expensive to heat. In future use it is very difficult&#13;
to conceive what the upper story can successfully be utilized for.&#13;
25.    The other type of building is a one story rural type structure which is infinitely more appropriate&#13;
and flexible. These buildings lend themselves considerably more readily to the changes in function being&#13;
suggested&#13;
26.    The rural hospitals contain suites of different types of consultation rooms, for general medicine,&#13;
surgery, gynecology, dentistry and rehabilitation. Further there are often well equipped delivery suites&#13;
and operating rooms. Wards are usually very cramped. Throughout the buildings toilet, sanitary and&#13;
utility facilities are very minimal, and important functions are missing.&#13;
27.    A present large numbers of staff seem to be dealing with comparatively small numbers of patients&#13;
Health Centers&#13;
28.    Generally the health centers visited were reasonably well planned, with well dimensioned spaces&#13;
and adequate numbers of item of equipment and furniture. However conditions varied and the structural&#13;
problems seen, usually the result of leaking roofs, appear to be increasing. Equipment and furniture were&#13;
also generally in poor condition.&#13;
29.    Health centers generally seem to be still very well staffed, with usually 2 to 3 general clinicians,&#13;
as well as pediatricians, gynecologists and dentists. However the total 10-15 staff which appear to be&#13;
present at most health centers do not appear to be overflooded with patients, a staff to patient ratio of 1&#13;
to between 4 and 6 being typical on a daily basis.&#13;
FAP'S&#13;
30.    These are usually small buildings where a limited staff of a nurse and a midwife carry out&#13;
something comparable to a district nursing function on behalf of a small local population. These buildings&#13;
with 3-4 rooms are usually domestic in character, with few installations and little equipment.&#13;
31.    The neatness and cleanliness of these units was always impressive and on the basis of present&#13;
functions, there does not appear any need for technical or financial support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
151                               ANNEX 3&#13;
Health Facility Design&#13;
32.    There are many details of design in the institutions which were visited, which are not considered&#13;
appropriate for health buildings. For example; no effort is made to ease access to buildings, rooms,&#13;
toilets, etc., for patients on wheeled stretchers or wheel chairs, trolleys, or any other wheeled transport&#13;
or carrying vehicles. Door widths and the positions of doors do not give good access to buildings and&#13;
rooms; There are not sufficient hand wash basins in ward rooms and procedure rooms for staff to be able&#13;
to wash their hands between dealing with patients; and floor coverings, wall finishes, design and&#13;
installation of sanitary fittings, etc., do not easily facilitate the maintenance of correct conditions of&#13;
hygiene.&#13;
Installations&#13;
33.    Heating installations, electrical and sanitary reticulations and fittings, drainage and sewage&#13;
disposal facilities, are not always adequate. Further there appears to be no attempt to conserve energy.&#13;
34.    Hot water is not readily available in any areas of the institutions.&#13;
35.    Electrical reticulations appear very basic. Electrical fittings, such as socket outlets, switches etc.,&#13;
are often damaged, indicating that they are not strong enough for use in public buildings.&#13;
36.    Sanitary fittings are usually very inadequate. They are difficult to keep clean, and in many&#13;
institutions large amounts of water is allowed to run to waste due to the lack of simple maintenance to&#13;
sanitary fittings and to the water reticulation.&#13;
37.    Refuse disposal seems mostly well organized, both sites and buildings seem to be efficiently&#13;
cleared of refuse and litter. The exceptions here appear to be the central hospitals in Bishkek.&#13;
Medical Equipment&#13;
38.    Inspection of a limited number of facilities suggests that at present there is an adequate number&#13;
of items of equipment of all different types, which with correct redistribution where problems have&#13;
occurred, will in most cases be sufficient to reasonably satisfy requirements over the coming period.&#13;
39.    However the situation with spare parts is in many cases very acute, in particular as the total lack&#13;
of maintenance and thereby lack of use of the items of equipment involved will quickly lead to total&#13;
dilapidation, and the destruction of valuable resources.&#13;
40.    During the inspections it was observed that in many institutions, there were no autoclaves&#13;
available or functioning, and instruments and syringes required for patient procedures were usually&#13;
'sterilized' in ovens. It is very doubtful whether this treatment is adequate. There was also observed an&#13;
acute shortage of surgical instruments and syringes.&#13;
Supplies&#13;
41.    There is now an acute shortage of all types of software, such as mattresses, pillows, bed linen,&#13;
covers and uniforms, medical supplies such as bandages, syringes and utensils and consumable, such as&#13;
x-ray film, chemicals and reagents and filters etc., as well as all forms of detergents and cleaning&#13;
solutions. All contribute significantly in reducing the quality of the activities taking place in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
152                              ANNEX 3&#13;
institutions, and also increasing efficiency. In particular the shortages of consumables seriously inhibit&#13;
the satisfactory functioning of services provided at the institutions.&#13;
42.    These problems require urgent attention and action.&#13;
Maintenance&#13;
43.    Though there are standard allotments in the recurrent budgets for the different health institutions&#13;
to pay for maintenance, these monies have not during the last three years, been made available. The&#13;
Ministry of Health has further closed down its central maintenance department and in effect the concept&#13;
of providing maintenance for buildings and equipment outside the Bishkek area has mainly been&#13;
discontinued, at least until finance is again made available.&#13;
44.   It is recommended that in spite of the extreme shortage of resources for maintenance, a policy&#13;
is established by MOH on appropriate and feasible (possible) maintenance for health institutions.&#13;
Management of Buildings and Estates&#13;
45.   In the question of the management of health building complexes, in providing equipment and&#13;
furniture to the different rooms, in ensuring that cleaning procedures are correct and adequate, in carrying&#13;
out maintenance and in making adaptations to existing plant and facilities, (for example when adapting&#13;
heating systems for changes of fuel), the managers of health institutions do not seem to be getting&#13;
adequate technical support for their decisions.&#13;
46.   Managers of health institutions should be correctly instructed regarding different aspects of the&#13;
management of buildings and grounds of health facilities. They should be informed of correct procedures&#13;
for carrying out the various necessary procedures. They should also be provided with qualified technical&#13;
support for decision making, design, ordering and implementation.&#13;
47.   At central level the previously well functioning hierarchy of Ministry technicians, consulting&#13;
architects and engineers, appears to have been disbanded through lack of work. Members of the MANAS&#13;
project group have been assigned this area of interest but there is still urgent need to reconstitute a&#13;
qualified forum of technical expertise.&#13;
48.    This should not be too difficult, as it has existed previously. The difficulty may now relate to the&#13;
changed status of individual architects and engineers who previously provided technical guidance but who&#13;
now consider that their input should be correctly financed.&#13;
49.   It should be relatively simple to solve the financial problems. If civil works are carried out in the&#13;
project and are eligible for containing with Local Competitive Bidding, it will be necessary to include in&#13;
budgets for paying fees to local private consultants. Their activities in developing the documentation&#13;
required for carrying out the projects should also allow for them participating actively as consultants to&#13;
the MOH civil works advisory committee.&#13;
Norms and Standards for Health Facilities&#13;
50.   The MOH civil works advisory committee should also be the forum where relevant building space&#13;
and quality norms are determined for health facilities in the Kyrgyz Republic. This would apply both for&#13;
the evaluation and effective utilization and also repair of existing buildings, as well as the formulation&#13;
long term budgets and investment plans for future constructions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
153                             ANNEX 3&#13;
Building Costs&#13;
51.   Due to the apparent lack of recent examples of completed health facility construction in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic, the local architects and quantity surveyors did not feel able to give precise rates for&#13;
different types of building construction activities. However rough figures were given and in this respect&#13;
it was agreed that it would be appropriate (in view of the imminent (though limited) activities being now&#13;
considered), that a price system should be established and developed, in order that in the near future&#13;
reasonably accurate and transparent / adaptable / escalatable estimates can be made.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
52.   The Bank emphasizes strongly the need to iniprove efficiency in the delivery of health services&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic and, through concentrating on essentially primary health care programs,&#13;
emphasizes the potential for reorganizing activities from being essentially in-patient orientated, to be&#13;
essentially out-patient orientated.&#13;
53.   Improvement of Primary Health Care facilities will naturally improve the status and acceptability&#13;
of the services provided there to the population.&#13;
54.   The results which can be achieved through improving the effectiveness of different medical&#13;
programs, will be reinforced by systematic efforts made improve functional and hygienic conditions in&#13;
the health infra-structure to ensure that the necessary improvements in efficiency are achieved.&#13;
55.    Further benefits which can be a result of including civil works activities in the various sub-&#13;
components of this project is that it will be possible to influence the way in which the Ministry of Health&#13;
administers hospitals and other health buildings and their grounds. It will further encourage a greater&#13;
readiness to consider the recurrent costs effects of buildings and equipment, it will demonstrate the&#13;
potential for carrying out maintenance on minimal budgets, it will show how existing buildings can be&#13;
utilized reducing the need for new ones and it will involve different disciplines in a collaboration to&#13;
determine relevant norms and standards for use in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
C. Activities Related to the Health Infrastructure&#13;
56.    Any effort to reduce the recurrent costs requirement for the health sector will imply significant&#13;
changes in the health service infrastructure. There are many possible strategies for this, all requiring&#13;
carefully planned and implemented programs. However it is recommended that future health programs&#13;
and activities should have the following main aims:&#13;
(i)    To reduce the extent of the health services delivery system&#13;
57.   This implies setting precise targets for future provision. (For example aiming to limit the numbers&#13;
of beds available in health institutions to 8 beds per 1000 population)&#13;
58.   These targets can be achieved by a number of means, including closing wards at lower level&#13;
institutions, by closing departments and by reducing the number of beds in individual wards, and by&#13;
reducing the average length of stay of in-patients in wards. This in turn can be achieved by improving&#13;
functional and hygienic conditions and thereby increasing efficiency at the institutions. (That is to say that&#13;
if all equipment is in working order and that there are sufficient drugs, reagents, X-ray film etc., and if&#13;
risks of cross-infection are kept a minimum and if the care programs aim to shorten the average length&#13;
of stay... .etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
154                             ANNEX 3&#13;
(ii)    To rationalize high technology within the health delivery system&#13;
59.   This can be achieved by concentrating surgical and specialized services at facilities at Raion level,&#13;
and also by evaluating carefully the distribution of equipment and installations to the lower levels.&#13;
(iui) To improve the efficient use of energy and promote the concept of enviromnental protection&#13;
60.   This can be achieved by introducing more economical heating systems which will also provide&#13;
water heating, by implementing water conservation and commodity material (eg. medical gasses)&#13;
conserving measures.&#13;
(iv)   To reintroduce appropriate maintenance services for both buildings and equipment&#13;
61.   This can be supported by establishing 'requirements for maintenance' as important procurement&#13;
criteria, and by the development of information systems for planning and administering maintenance. The&#13;
establishment of appropriate maintenance services can in the long term only be achieved by making funds&#13;
available through economies in other areas.&#13;
(v)    To inprove the overall management of the health infrastructure&#13;
62.   This can be supported by the development of app.opriate norms and standards for use in health&#13;
facility planning and evaluation. The norms would cover spacial provision norms , utilization criteria,&#13;
specification standards for materials and installations. It could further be supported by the development&#13;
and implementation of an information collecting system for providing data on the extent and condition&#13;
of facilities in the health service infrastructure.&#13;
63.   It should be emphasized that considerable more resources are used in hospitals and that the&#13;
potential in this sector for making savings is considerably greater. This fact in itself motivates for not&#13;
only focusing on Primary health.&#13;
COMPONENT ELEMENTS&#13;
64.   It can be anticipated that it will take a number of years to achieve the above goals, much longer&#13;
than the anticipated duration of the project. However, it is important to address the whole question of the&#13;
relationship of the Kyrgyz health infrastructure, its buildings, installations and equipment, to the quality&#13;
and efficiency of health services and thereafter to the recurrent costs required to finance those services&#13;
65.   The following activities would be included in the project and where possible integrated into the&#13;
various project components which are being proposed:&#13;
(a)    Carrying out pilot construction and procurement activities in connection with project components.&#13;
Essentially this will involve converting rural hospitals into polyclinics , upgrading ambulatory&#13;
centers and providing the equipment and supplies necessary to ensure efficient performance.&#13;
(b)    The training of technicians and administrators at all levels in estates management,&#13;
(c)    Development of norms and standards together with local experts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
155                              ANNEX 3&#13;
(d)    Development and implementation of information system for collecting data on health facilities and&#13;
for making masterplans for future development,&#13;
ANTICIPATED ACHEVEMENTS FROM THE INPUTS&#13;
66.   The results which can be anticipated from the input being proposed are as follows:&#13;
67.   In connection with programs being proposed in the project for the improvement of services, in&#13;
particular within the concept of primary care, Civil works and procurement activities will be carried&#13;
out as a basis for ensuring the successful implementation of the new services. Here in almost every case&#13;
works will concern the adaptation of existing facilities, and it is anticipated that the Ministry of Health&#13;
will here be able to obtain practical experience of the various (for them new) concepts being promoted.&#13;
'Reuse of existing structures', 'appropriate technology', 'user participation', 'energy conservation',&#13;
'estates management', will be concepts which it is anticipated will be demonstrated as essential for&#13;
incorporating in future work in connection with the health infrastructure of the Kyrgyz health services.&#13;
68.    As a consequence of the preparatory and development work necessary as a normal part of the&#13;
project development process for the above civil works and procurement activities, 'Estates management'&#13;
will be developed as an important concept which influences the efficient utilization of health facilities.&#13;
Using the norms and standards described below and participating in the implementation in the project of&#13;
an agreed information collection system, MOH managers will automatically be given a greater insight into&#13;
the means available to solve problems concerning the maintenance and development of the buildings and&#13;
plant under their supervision. Further in the procurement and contract management activities relating to&#13;
the project, it is aimed to effectively utilize resources available at local level. This is also anticipated to&#13;
fturther contribute to providing a basis for improving the performance of local managers in estates&#13;
management&#13;
69.   In order to carry out the intended civil works and equipment procurement activities it will be&#13;
necessary to develop in collaboration with Kyrgyz experts, appropriate Norms and Standards for&#13;
evaluating, planning, rehabilitating and constructing health facilities will be established. Generally these&#13;
norms will always refer to the present shortage of resources, and will strive to relate to accepted&#13;
concepts of appropriateness, and economy in use. The norms and standards will hopefully form the basis&#13;
for all future activities concerning the health infrastructure and will influence activities by both the&#13;
government and donors, influencing decisions which will be appropriate and sustainable.&#13;
70.   In the same way Masterplans will be developed to provide information of the condition and&#13;
content of the health facilities which will be the subjects of project activity. In this way the Ministry of&#13;
Health will be provided with a simple system for collecting comparable data on the scope and quality of&#13;
all facilities within the health infrastructure and at the same time a basis will be provided with tools for&#13;
making priorities and assessing the feasibility of making changes.&#13;
71.   The results of the project activities therefore are anticipated also to influence utilization and costs&#13;
in the secondary and tertiary health sectors.&#13;
D. Infrastructure&#13;
Objectives&#13;
72.   The main objective of this activity is to make repairs and functional changes required at raion&#13;
level health service facilities and provide specific items of equipment and consumables which will ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
156                              ANNEX 3&#13;
that the correct conditions are available for both existing activities as well as for supporting the&#13;
implementation of new and revised programs&#13;
73.    A secondary objective is that through the development of the brief, in establishing norms and&#13;
standards, in developing routines for contracting and administration, in collecting data required for these&#13;
works, the Ministry of Health will be provided with a basis for improving its own Estates Management&#13;
and for defining the appropriate content and emphases for future rehabilitation projects.&#13;
Main Features&#13;
74.    The main feature of the activities proposed is the emphasis made on involvement of MOH/Kyrgyz&#13;
expertise, in order to ensure that the results attained are both appropriate and acceptable to local needs&#13;
and thereby are sustainable.&#13;
Requirements from the Ministry of Health&#13;
75.    The Ministry of Health would establish an appropriate policy with regards capital investments and&#13;
the management health infrastructure. It would acknowledge that every increase in buildings and plant&#13;
will imply unacceptable recurrent costs implications. The Ministry has already today many more square&#13;
meters of buildings than it requires to provide its different services, and the theme in future should be&#13;
acknowledged to be 'consolidate' 'rehabilitate', 'reuse', if possible 'decommission', rather than 'new&#13;
construction' and 'expansion'.&#13;
76.    New policy would therefore emphasize a complete freeze on the construction of new health&#13;
facilities and would indicate that investments and civil works activities should concentrate through repair&#13;
maintenance and adaption, on attaining maximum efficiency and appropriate functional quality in existing&#13;
structures.&#13;
77.   The organization of the Ministry's civil works administration would reflect this change of&#13;
emphasis, and present Ministry officers would have their Descriptions of Employment amended&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
78.   It is further desirable that the Ministry would establish advisory committees and stakeholder&#13;
groups, in order to receive technical support in matters dealing with both civil works activities and the&#13;
procurement and maintenance of medical equipment. The stakeholder groups are small communities of&#13;
users--both health authorities and local government officials, established at each facility to be&#13;
rehabilitated/upgraded. The work of the group will be to provide information as required on functional&#13;
problems and requirements, and to approve the proposals made for improvements and alterations. In this&#13;
way it is anticipated that the results of the investments will be better appreciated by local staff and users,&#13;
and log term aims regarding increased efficiency and quality will more easily be attained.&#13;
Needs for Rehabilitation of Facilities&#13;
79.    During the June/July 1995 mission a MOH/World Bank team carried out surveys at 27 selected&#13;
health facilities. Though mainly concentrating on ambulatory centers and rural hospitals which are agreed&#13;
will be the subject of the activities financed by the project, comprehensive data was also collected at&#13;
Raion Hospitals, District Hospitals etc., where it was considered that conditions were particularly acute,&#13;
and where it was anticipated that considerable savings could be made in recurrent costs requirements&#13;
through the consolidation and functional decondition of individual buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
157                               ANNEX 3&#13;
Results of the Inspections&#13;
80.    The result of the inspections is that more detailed information has been obtained on the actual&#13;
condition of a reasonable number of health facilities in one Oblast, and the requirements which exist for&#13;
rebuilding, renovation and refurbishing in order to provide conditions which are acceptable. Evaluation&#13;
of conditions at the different facilities has been based on assessment of two main factors, FUNCTIONAL&#13;
QUALITY considered in terms of OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.&#13;
81.    Observations confirm that in these areas there are a lot of improvements which should be made.&#13;
Especially that:&#13;
(i)    There are too many facilities (Provision norms,-beds, clinics, staff, are high, utilization and&#13;
productivity is low. Departments are over-institutionalized, there is no flexibility)&#13;
(ii)    Hygienic conditions are very poor (Wards are very cramped, toilet facilities limited, working&#13;
conditions for staff are poor, important equipment (such as sterilizing equipment etc..) is not&#13;
functioning, materials for cleaning is in short supply, staff are often badly motivated).&#13;
(iii)   Functional conditions are very poor (Shortages of working equipment, physical separation of&#13;
relating departments, lack of consunumables, etc.)&#13;
(iv)   Equipment and buildings are in bad repair (Equipment and buildings often are too difficult or&#13;
too costly to maintain. Resources for maintenance are not available, maintenance is giving low&#13;
priority by administrators)&#13;
(v)    Running costs are far too high (Over provision of facilities and amenities as mentioned above.&#13;
Further heating systems are often extremely expensive to run and maintain. Many district heating&#13;
systems have above-ground-none-insulated pipe reticulations which may be contributing to&#13;
atmospheric overheating but waste fuel and are not adequately heating the buildings).&#13;
82.    The implication of the surveys therefore is that it is easily apparent that refurbishment work is&#13;
required at all institutions, possibly with the exception of the FAP's. However it would be very wrong&#13;
for this or any other project to merely repair and repaint the facilities in their present form without&#13;
making an effort to correct the serious faults which have been observed which seriously detract from the&#13;
quality and efficiency with which services are provided, thereby incurring unreasonably high recurrent&#13;
costs.&#13;
83.    The costings included for the proposals made include for required functional changes. However&#13;
at this stage the detail of the provision still must be defined and agreed designs and specifications are&#13;
finally issued.&#13;
84.    Attached are illustrative drawings and specifications for three representative facilities; a raion&#13;
hospital, polyclinic, and health center. A complete set is in the project's working papers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
158                             ANNEX 3&#13;
E. Costs for Civil Works Activities&#13;
New Works&#13;
85.   It has been difficult to obtain reliable figures for the costs of new building construction in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. There are two main reasons for this:&#13;
(i)    Very little new construction work has been implemented during the last 5 years,&#13;
(ii)    With regards the construction projects which were carried out before then, very little&#13;
attention seems to have been paid to costs.&#13;
86.   During project preparation, quite some time has been spent discussing costs with various clients,&#13;
technicians, 'experts', etc., and the following costs levels have been tabled and have generally been&#13;
accepted as being not unreasonable.&#13;
87.   The rates used do in fact compare generally to costs in other countries with similar conditions&#13;
to the Kyrgyz Republic, very low labor costs, some skills available, importation necessary of all but the&#13;
most basic building materials, etc.&#13;
Square Meter Rates&#13;
88.   The rates for construction used in compiling the proposals contained in this report therefore are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Type of Facility            new construction&#13;
Rural Hospitals             US$ 240&#13;
Polyclinics                 US$ 240&#13;
Health centers              US$ 180&#13;
FAPS                        US$ 180&#13;
Elemental Rates for Renovation and Refurbishing Works&#13;
89.   In order to calculate the costs of the repair and replacement of various building materials it has&#13;
been necessary to apportion the above square meter rates to the different building elements used in&#13;
construction. This again is based at this stage on previous experience with other projects carried out in&#13;
other countries, adjusted for anticipated conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
159                            ANNEX 3&#13;
Elemental perentages of cost for an average square meter of building:&#13;
Foundations                4.54%&#13;
Concrete                   4.39%&#13;
Bricklayer                 12 08%&#13;
Roofer                     5.11 % (Roof covering 2.34% only)&#13;
Joiner                     20.18%&#13;
Metalwork                  5.45%&#13;
Plasterer                  6.26% (includes ceilings)&#13;
Flooring                   7.91 %&#13;
Plumber                   13.19%&#13;
Glazier                     1.51%&#13;
Painter                    5.12%&#13;
Electrical Installations   14.26%&#13;
TOTAL                     100.00%&#13;
(It must again be emphasized that it has not been possible so far to verify the rates locally).&#13;
On this basis the rates can be established for different types of building work&#13;
Polyclinic    Health center&#13;
Rate per m2                            USD 240      USD 180&#13;

Ironmon,gery        2.72               USD  6.54   USD  4.89&#13;
90.   The following overall budget for the works reconunended at the different institutions is based on&#13;
the above figures. It is strongly recommended that the figures are further verified by comparing with&#13;
conditions in other FSU countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
160                            ANNEX 3&#13;
Budget for Works Proposed to be Financed by the Project&#13;
91.   In line with its general emphasis on primary health care, the project will finance the improvement&#13;
of 30 Ambulatory Centers, (at an average cost of US$10 000 each) and the conversion of 30 Rural&#13;
Hospitals into Polyclinics (at an average cost of US$40 000 each). Further US$ 300 000 for equipment&#13;
and US$ 150 000 for supplies will be provided to ensure efficient performance of the renovated /&#13;
converted facilities&#13;
92.   The construction works will be split up into 4 lots. The facilities to be included in the first lot&#13;
have been provisionally identified from those in Chui Oblast which have been surveyed and are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Institution&#13;
1     Bishkek Road - Polyclinic&#13;
2     Belogorka Village - Village Doctor Amb.&#13;
3     October Village - FAP&#13;
4     Shopokov Village - Polyclinic&#13;
5     Shopokov Village - Paediatric Clinic&#13;

93.   It is important to emphasize that the figures shown above are based on outline surveys and&#13;
budgets and are included to indicate the types of sections required at different institutions. During the&#13;
implementation of the project more detailed budgets will be drawn up for the 45 institutions listed but&#13;
which have not been surveyed so far. However it is anticipated that within the project as a whole the&#13;
investments in different types of institutions will reflect the averages given for ambulatories (US$10,000&#13;
each) and polyclinics (US$40,000). Final equipment lists and specifications for all institutions included&#13;
in the project must be submitted to the Association for approval before tendering is implemented.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 4: MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER PAYMENT COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.     The Kyrgyz Republic's health financing and delivery system reflects -- to a relatively large extent&#13;
-- the old regime of rational planning and hierarchic structure found throughout the former Soviet Union&#13;
health system.' Historically, the system has been financed in a centralized "top-down" bureaucratic&#13;
allocation process, based upon national budgets formulated and passed by the central legislative and&#13;
policy-making bodies.&#13;
2.      The health financing system has been beset by two significant issues, however, related to sources&#13;
of funds and uses of funds. The first is that allocated budget levels historically have tended toward&#13;
chronic underfunding. The old Soviet system allocated funds for health protection on a "residual" basis&#13;
from general tax revenues; levels of funds were determnined only after budgets were allocated for other&#13;
"productive" sectors such as industry, manufacturing, and defense. Over the last several years, national&#13;
independence and the general economic decline has exacerbated the issue of underfunding. Independence&#13;
from the Soviet Union has forced self-sufficiency for the Republic which historically enjoyed a positive&#13;
net transfer of resources from Moscow through the tax system (World Bank, 1992). The economic&#13;
decline that the Kyrgyz Republic (and most other parts of the NIS) has suffered over the past several&#13;
years has resulted in reduced tax revenues being generated locally. An emerging funding crisis in health&#13;
services has been the result.&#13;
3.      The share of the region's GDP devoted to health historically has been low, and also erratic since&#13;
the 1980s--falling from 6%  of GDP to just over 3%  for the New Independent States (NIS) as a whole.&#13;
In the Kyrgyz Republic, spending as a percent of GDP was 4.1 % in 1990, but has fallen for 3 of the last&#13;
four years. Schieber (World Bank, 1995) reports that the most complete information available is for&#13;
public spending including spending from the consolidated budget (including all Ministries not just the&#13;
MOH), extra-budgetary public expenditures on health, and enterprise spending on health. The ratio of&#13;
public health expenditures to GDP declined from 4.2% of GDP in 1990 to 2.6% in 1993, with an&#13;
increase to 3.6% in 1994. The GDP in 1994 is only 50% of the 1990 level. Similarly, 1994 real (GDP&#13;
deflator adjusted) health expenditures are only 46 % of the 1990 level, up from 40% of the 1990 level&#13;
in 1993. In short, there has been a 50% reduction in real output in the Kyrgyz Republic since 1990,&#13;
accompanied by a 54% reduction in real public health spending.2&#13;
4.      Schieber (World Bank, 1995) further found the picture even more bleak when per person&#13;
spending is converted into U.S. dollars using purchasing power parities (i.e., exchange rates which adjust&#13;
for cost of living differences across countries). Public budget health spending in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
in 1993 dropped to only one-fourth the 1990 level.&#13;
I Each individual in urban areas is assigned to a polyclinic and has a primary care physician (not a general practitioner, but a therapist,&#13;
pediatrician, or obstetrician/gynecologist); in rural areas, there is a basic health unit, called a FAP, of one or more physician-extenders (e.g.,&#13;
feldshers or nurses), and rural ambulatory centers.&#13;
2 According to Abel-Smith (1994), there has been a fall in output of the industrial sector of 50 per cent, and a drop in export revenue by&#13;
65 per cent between 1991 and the end of 1993. Between 1992 and 1993, there was a decline in real GDP by 16 per cent and tax revenue fell&#13;
from 14 per cent of GDP to 8 per cent. The economy has further suffered from hyperinflation. Retail prices have been rising by 15-25 per&#13;
cent a month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
176                                ANNEX 4&#13;
5.     A second problem with the former Soviet approach to health care delivery is that it does not&#13;
encourage the efficient use of resources by providers or between them. This was due in part to a system&#13;
which allocated resources based on traditional central planning production input measures, such as&#13;
occupancy and numbers of staff and beds, rather than services performed, relative complexity of services,&#13;
or changes in health status. Schieber (World Bank, 1995) reports that recent trends are somewhat&#13;
encouraging, but overall numbers suggest a system that remains bloated. The number of beds per 1,000&#13;
population has declined from 12 in 1981 to 9.5 in 1994, but is still some 15 percent above the OECD&#13;
average. Similarly, while hospital admissions rates have declined from 25 percent of the population being&#13;
admitted in 1987 to 18 percent in 1994, the Kyrgyz Republic is still 20 percent above the OECD average.&#13;
The average length of hospital stay has declined by about one day over the past 15 years to 15.6 days&#13;
in 1994, but remains slightly above the 14 day OECD average. The average number of inpatient days&#13;
of care per year per person has declined from 3.6 days in 1978 to 2.8 in 1994, but is still some 15&#13;
percent above the OECD average. The hospital occupancy has declined from 90 percent in 1978 to 81&#13;
percent in 1994, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.&#13;
6.     The number of physicians per 1,000 population has increased by some 30 percent over the past&#13;
15 years to reach 3.1 in 1994 (of which 0.45 are dentists), somewhat above the OECD average of 2.2.&#13;
Only 35 percent are generalists (defined to include therapists, pediatricians, and obstetricians), whereas&#13;
the percent share in many OECD countries (excluding the U.S.) is closer to 50 (e.g., United Kingdom)&#13;
to 70 percent (e.g., Canada). The number of physician contacts per year is comparable to the high&#13;
utilization rates in the OECD countries.&#13;
7.     There are other health financing sector problems as well including an acute shortage of&#13;
pharmaceuticals, equipment, and supplies.3 These shortages have occurred partly at the expense of an&#13;
overemphasis of resources placed in staff and beds. Facility budgets based on production input measures&#13;
such as beds provide incentives to increase capacity. A high level of facility capacity within the system&#13;
results in high fixed costs. This problem has worsened over the last few years with the deregulation of&#13;
energy prices, exacerbated by inefficient heating systems. For example, in Issyk-kul Oblast utilities&#13;
consume approximately 30% of total costs. For small rural hospitals the problem is even worse, utilities&#13;
consume approximately 67 % of total costs. The decrease in financing and an increase in the proportion&#13;
of expenses allocated to fixed costs have combined to produce critical shortages and depletion of&#13;
inventory levels in pharmaceuticals, equipment, and supplies.&#13;
B. Current Flow of Funds for Health Care&#13;
8.     The health sector is financed (at least formally) from general taxation revenues. In general, the&#13;
responsibility of collecting general taxes has devolved over the last few years to the oblasts and rayons,&#13;
not the central government. At the same time, the scope and authority to tax remains inflexible and is&#13;
largely determined by the central govermnent. Once collected, money is either passed on to the central&#13;
Ministry of Finance or kept at the individual oblast level depending upon the central allocation formulas.&#13;
In some cases, the oblast receives additional subsidies beyond the general taxation base. Currently,&#13;
Bishkek and Chui pass along some of their revenues to the central goverrnent, while two oblasts -- Osh&#13;
and Djal Abad -- keep what they have collected. The remaining oblasts -- Naryn, Talas, and Issyk-Kul -&#13;
- receive central government subsidies in addition to what they collect. A few taxes (e.g., the road tax&#13;
' Many repons, including Abel-Smith (1994), a comprehensive review by Welsby (1994) and most recently Haycock (1995), report that&#13;
supplics of drags, equipment, asd consumables remain inadequate. Shortages mentioned specifically include anesthetics, X-ray plates, surgical&#13;
supplies, food for patients, gasoline for ambulances, fuel for heating water and even sheets. There is often no replacement or repair of equipment&#13;
needing spare parts. Equipment includes ambulances, incubators, respiratory equipment, autoclaves and washing machines. Schieber (1995)&#13;
nicely summarizes the pharmaceuticals problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
177                                     ANNEX 4&#13;
and Presidential tax) remain strictly federal taxes.4&#13;
9.      The allocation or disbursement of funds works in a parallel fashion, with the central government&#13;
developing allocation norms across and within sectors, while the actual budget process has generally&#13;
devolved to the oblast and rayon levels.&#13;
10.    A  recent Bank study (May  1995) by Helga Muller found that in  1994 oblast and local&#13;
governments collected 84 percent of the health expenditure. The report suggests that while it makes sense&#13;
to delegate social programs to a subnational level, that there is increasing inequities across oblasts in&#13;
terms of revenues raised versus needs for social programs. Per capita public health spending varied by&#13;
1.7:1 across oblasts in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1994, but the report implies increased variations could&#13;
occur over time. The study recommends that the central government should mandate minimum service&#13;
levels and develop allocation formulas for critical expenditures in health in order to better equalize fiscal&#13;
capacity with actual collections as well as to better match collections versus actual needs and demands&#13;
for services.&#13;
11.      Within the health sector itself, there are four levels of disbursement of funds for facilities. The&#13;
first level is comprised of the Republican institutions, designed to serve the whole population and&#13;
generally highly specialized. At the second level the six oblasts and Bishkek city operate institutions of&#13;
a mixed primary and specialized nature, open to all citizens within the oblast. Each oblast is further&#13;
subdivided into rayons which operate primary care facilities, and local and district hospitals -- largely for&#13;
rural areas. After fourth sentence, add sentence: Finally, within the oblast, municipalities also operate&#13;
primary care facilities and hospitals, largely for urban residents. The central Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance&#13;
does allocate funds directly towards budgets for the national specialty facilities or the Republican&#13;
institutions. The central government also allocate budgets directly for medical education and research,&#13;
and more traditional public health activities.5 About six percent of the federal budget is earmarked for&#13;
certain pre-determined health care activities such as public health.&#13;
12.     The Ministry of Finance also sets expenditure norms for oblast and rayon level administrations.&#13;
With these norms, individual facilities at the oblast and rayon levels develop proposed budgets. For&#13;
inpatient facilities, the norms include nominal numbers of beds and senior medical personnel. For&#13;
outpatient facilities, the norms are based on capacity as measured by numbers of physicians and&#13;
"potential" numbers of visits. Budgets are reviewed and approved by local oblast and rayon finance&#13;
administrations, after consultation with facilities, the local ministries of health, and the local exchequer&#13;
office. The budgets are handed down in 18 restrictive budget categories such as salary, utilities, and&#13;
pharmaceuticals. Traditionally, funds could not be spent outside of categories, though there are reports&#13;
£ A good example is the recent Presidential Decree on the Budget for the First Quarter of 1995 (dated January 25, 1995) which states that&#13;
'the size of allocations to the local budgets of provinces and Bishkek city in the following amounts:&#13;
o       from the VAT tax on Osh, Issyk-Rul, Naryn, Talas, Jalal-Abad provinces - 100 percent; on Chui province 42 percent, on Bishkek&#13;
city 22 percent;&#13;
o       from the excise tax on Osb, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Talas, Jalal-Abad provinces -- 100 percent, on Chui province 42 percent, on Bishkek&#13;
city 23 percent;&#13;
o       from the profit tax on enterprises, incorporation, and organizations on all forms of ownership on Osh, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Talas&#13;
provinces -- 100 percent; on Jalal-Abad province, 31.8 percent. Chui province 42 percent, on Bishkek city 23 percent;&#13;
o       from the tax on tumover in retail trade and service to the population on Osh, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Talas, Jalal-Abad provinces -- 100&#13;
percent; on Chui province 42 percent, on Bishkek city 23 percent."&#13;
'These traditional public health categories include orphan homes, treatment of AlDs, support of infectious disease hospitals such as TB&#13;
sanitoria, basic sanitation and epidemiologic activities, emergency hospitals and transport vehicles, blood transfusion centers, cancer treatment,&#13;
narcotic addiction centers, and medical supply storage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
178                                         ANNEX 4&#13;
of some increased flexibility (Haycock, 1995). However, there is also anecdotal evidence that the&#13;
implementation of the Treasury system has acted to further restrict the flexibility of facilities to allocate&#13;
funds outside the budget categories.&#13;
13.      Local and oblast budgets are aggregated and returned to the central Ministry of Finance which&#13;
uses them to develop a tax plan to match expected revenue and spending.6 The central Ministry of&#13;
Finance then informs the oblast administrations of the final approval for public spending levels with a&#13;
recommendation (but not a necessary condition) for allocation between the sectors (Haycock, 1995). This&#13;
means that spending patterns between local sectors can be altered (for fiscal, political or other reasons),&#13;
though discussions with oblast and rayon leaders in other parts of the NIS suggest the shifts are minor&#13;
and infrequent (see Schieber, Back-to-Office Report, February 1995).&#13;
C. Recent Reforms&#13;
14.      The Kyrgyz Government proposed  a series of health sector reforms, including  the Health&#13;
Protection Act which was passed and signed into law in July 1992. The Health Protection Act calls for&#13;
a shift in priorities toward health promotion and disease prevention policies and a new emphasis on&#13;
primary and family-based care. It calls for changes in the form of property - conversion of pharmacies&#13;
and pharmaceutical institutions into private and joint-stock companies; conversion of medical institutions&#13;
into joint-stock companies; incentives to establish private hospitals, polyclinics, and physician practice;&#13;
and private pay and leasing arrangements within public facilities.&#13;
15.      The law provides for diversification and decentralization of sources of revenue as well. Financing&#13;
of health care can be moved "off-budget", and no longer be solely reliant on general government&#13;
revenues. At least one public health insurance fund ("Territorial Health Insurance Fund' -- or "THIF")&#13;
can be created in each oblast, to be financed through multiple sources of revenue.' Additional sources&#13;
of revenue include private or "voluntary" health insurance coverage, local user fees for pharnaceuticals&#13;
and outpatient services,8 and donor funding.&#13;
16.      More importantly, the recent legislation separates financing and payment for services from  the&#13;
I For example, the Prsidential Decree on the Budget for the First Quarter of 1995 (dated January 25, 1995) stated that the income tax 'levied&#13;
from the citizens by enterprises, institudons, and organizations in Chui province in the size of 58 percent and in Bishkek city 78 percent.'&#13;
' Sources of revenue include:&#13;
o        funds from the current 34.5% Social Insurance and Pension Fund payroll tax, which are currently used for payment of temporary&#13;
and permanent disability, social security, other forms of cash assistance, and health. (Approximately 86% of the payroll tax is used&#13;
for sick leave, pregnancy, adoption of children, child care up to 3 years of age, care of disabled children up to 14 years, sanitoria&#13;
and resort smy entitlements of from 18-24 days per year per worker. The remaining 14% is used for "other purposes".)&#13;
o        a new, minimum 6% payroll contribution paid by employers;&#13;
o        a capitated rate paid by the oblast govermment into the fund to cover non-working and exempted populations not contribudng through&#13;
the employer payroll - emnployees of "public budget organizations" (e.g., schools and hospitals), elderly, unemployed, disabled,&#13;
women and children. While the payments would continue to be made by the oblast government, actual source of funding would be&#13;
split about 75%/25% between revenues raised by the oblast and central government.&#13;
The oblast government would also continue to allocate funds directly to hospitals and clinics for construction/capital improvements, expensive&#13;
equipment, and education/training programs. The central government would continue support of medical education and research, and more&#13;
traditional public health activities.&#13;
While this funding approach decentralizes decision making, it also raises concems about perpetuating or exacerbating inequities in funding across&#13;
individual oblasts (see Haycock, 1995).&#13;
' See, for example, Haycock (World Bank, 1995) and Abt Associates (July, 1994) for more complete discussions of user fees and user&#13;
charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
179                                      ANNEX 4&#13;
direct provision of care. This means that payers of health care services can contract with providers,&#13;
determine the method of payment, and the payment amounts or rates to providers. Third-party payers&#13;
of services act as a catalyst for the prudent purchase of care on behalf of individual consumers, by&#13;
changing the incentives faced by hospitals, polyclinics, and individual providers.9&#13;
17.     Likewise, administrators could receive payments based on the number of cases, the severity of&#13;
the case, and the performance of treatment. These payment changes would create incentives that&#13;
encourage more efficient organization and management of service delivery and improved quality of the&#13;
care. The focus of care could shift toward primary and outpatient care. Polyclinic and hospital&#13;
administrators would have increased flexibility to utilize resources as they see fit to produce services&#13;
efficiently. Public sector providers now provide the bulk of services, though private sector providers&#13;
could compete to provide services.&#13;
18.     Payment changes are consistent with donor organization recommendations over the last few years.&#13;
Bobodilla and Ellis (World Bank, 1992), for example, called for incentive-based payment systems to&#13;
replace the current budgeting approaches. Abel-Smith (1993) and Holmes (June 1994 Manas Conference)&#13;
have called for capitation-based physician payments and bulk-billing arrangements for inpatient care.&#13;
19.     The insurance reform  law was originally written to be implemented in 1993. Concerns about its&#13;
design and rapid implementation schedule, as well as problems with reforms in other sectors (e.g., the&#13;
banking system) and general lack of technical expertise have delayed the implementation date several&#13;
times since."' Other health sector changes have occurred. Most notably, direct payments for outpatient&#13;
services and for outpatient pharmaceuticals have been introduced. Haycock (1995) notes that current law&#13;
prohibits users fees for inpatient services. Nevertheless, there is a sizable base of anecdotal evidence&#13;
(e.g., discussions with hospital administrators) indicating user fees are applied to inpatient services.&#13;
Patients also frequently must provide their own food, drugs and consumables for inpatient stays." The&#13;
recent United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report (1995) found that user fees account for an&#13;
increasing and sometimes majority portion of revenues for some facilities. More troubling is the recent&#13;
ODA survey showing that user fees are both increasing rapidly but also affecting economically vulnerable&#13;
Importantly. the reform law generally follows an approach familiar to NIS countries that stems from initiates strting in 1989 when the&#13;
so-clled New Economic Mechanisms (NEM) were announced as approved in Moscow under the former Soviet structure. The NEM provided&#13;
for greater local autonomy and a number of demonstration sites in each of the republics. For example, Kemnerovo, Kaluga. Samira, and St.&#13;
Petersburg were demonstration sites in the Russian Federation.&#13;
Three areas of change were focused on:&#13;
o        restructuring of financing -- health budgets would be developed differendy. A formula of 18 production input categories was replaced&#13;
by a stndard per capita payment based on a mix of measures of resource use and historic trends;&#13;
o       organization and management restructuring - through greater autonomy and management systems;&#13;
o        improved internal efficiency in the delivery of care - through improved payments for services within nd across facilities.&#13;
The NEM demonstration sites were cancelled or superseded by subsequent health insurance laws in Russia and other NIS countries, but the&#13;
general principles of NEM took root in terms of the recognition of the need for greater flexibility of resource aflocation, payment to personnel&#13;
and some limited management restructuring approaches.&#13;
'° Gmeater detail about the health insurance law and the masons for the delay in its implementation can be found in Abel-Smith. 1993. More&#13;
recendy, Abel-Smith (1994) noted some progress has probably been made in assuring a reasonably efficient and safe system of banking&#13;
transactions.&#13;
" Haycock (1995) has found that inpatient facilities also accept 'informal payments' for pharmaceuticals, food, consumables, even acess&#13;
to basic services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
180                                         ANNEX 4&#13;
groups and negatively affecting quality and access to care."2 Finally, a small number of employer groups&#13;
negotiate contracts with hospitals for services to their employees, public sector physicians accept private&#13;
pay patients through special leasing arrangements, and at least 4 new private or "voluntary" insurance&#13;
companies have emerged in Bishkek and elsewhere in the country.'3"4&#13;
20.      These activities point to a health sector in transition in the Kyrgyz Republic, moving from  a&#13;
publicly-based central planning scheme to a more privatized, public/private mix in the organization and&#13;
financing of care. At the same time, these activities are incremental and may have unintended&#13;
consequences for efficiency and access to care. As a result, the government decided to test its legislated&#13;
financing and delivery system reform model as a way of implementing a more comprehensive strategy&#13;
for change. While implementation of its 1992 law is still delayed, it has chosen to pilot test the model&#13;
in at least one geographic area, Issyk-kul Oblast.&#13;
21.      Initially, the demonstration did not cover the entire oblast; rather, it was designated to begin in&#13;
a "Free Economic Zone" (or FEZ) of the town of Karakol, and three surrounding raions within the&#13;
oblast. 5 The site was chosen because of the FEZ designation, the relatively strong industrial base and&#13;
potential mining resources, and the relatively high per capita level of spending on health care in this&#13;
oblast relative to the rest of the country (the Kyrgyz Republic MOH, 1994). The Issyk-kul pilot&#13;
requested that the pilot be extended to the entire oblast, the Ministry of Health approved this request.&#13;
Implementation of a comprehensive demonstration in a portion of the oblast creates political and technical&#13;
problems including cross-subsidies and competitive disadvantages across rayons, and the need to&#13;
determine how to reimburse for referrals across boundaries.&#13;
22.      In Spring 1994, the Ministry of Health requested technical assistance from  USAID/Abt Associates&#13;
in implementing the Issyk-Kul health reform experiment, as well as assistance in training personnel who&#13;
would help implement it. Many of the details of the demonstration follow from the principles of the&#13;
health reform legislation. At the same time, the legislation, left many specific implementation issues to&#13;
be addressed during the transition period. This was particularly true in the areas of organizational and&#13;
delivery system structure, payment methods, quality assurance, information systems design and cost&#13;
accounting methods.&#13;
"2Bank staff met with British ODA representatives during the June/July 1995 Mission to discuss the possibility of ODA developing a model&#13;
user fee framework for piloting and application. The ODA representative expressed considerable interest in pursuing technical assistance in 1995&#13;
in this area. Any user fee schedule should include several principles such as 1) free services for all communicable diseases; 2) free services for&#13;
non-communicable diseases for the economically vulnerable and partial fees for other groups; and 3) full cost recovery for more discretionary&#13;
(e.g., dermatology) services, with some rationing of access for the economically vulnerable.&#13;
1"These initiatives are described in greater detail in the Wein and Langenbrunner Trip Report of March 22-April 2, 1994, Abt Associates,&#13;
Inc. under its Health Financing and Sustainability Project for USAID.&#13;
"Among other things, these changes have greatly diversified and complicated the flow of funds in the health sector, and suggest the utility&#13;
of a broader national health accounts structure to better understand both sources and uses of funds in the health sector.&#13;
" The demonstration site is approximately 100 kilometers south and east of Almaty. The demonstration site has a population of about&#13;
253,000 according to the official Ministry statistics.&#13;
The town of Karakol has about 70,000 residents, and is best known for its production of submarine torpedoes and testing at nearby Lake Issyk-&#13;
Kul. The FEZ designation for Karakol allows the city to have more autonomy in raising and spending revenues. Karakol has initiated several&#13;
promising tax changes as of January 1994 to spur new investment: 5-year "tax holidays" for new businesses, 10 year "tax holidays' for new&#13;
finns employing more than 300 Kyrgyz and provide investments of at least 1.5 million com, tax deductions for all employers and individuals&#13;
for all spending on health, education, and "communal' activities.&#13;
The three adjacent rayons of Dzhetiougouz, Ak-Sou, and Tyup are largely agricultural, though there is some manufacturing in the three rayons.&#13;
Throughout the area there are mining deposits and increased mining activity related to gold, uranium, and other deposits. Sheep herding also&#13;
continues, especially near the mountainous areas which surround the area's lake.&#13;
&#13;

23.   The pilot demonstration provides the first opportunity to implement the new law in a systematic&#13;
way for a specified geographic area, and to use lessons from it for a longer-term national implementation.&#13;
An initial proposal was developed by USAID/Abt Associates (see report of July 15, 1994) for the&#13;
demonstration design and implementation; the proposal was subsequently finalized and agreed upon with&#13;
the oblast and central governments. A number of activities and initiatives started over the latter part of&#13;
1994 relative to implementation of the demonstration.&#13;
24.   The medical care provider payment component would extend the Issyk-kul pilot to Bishkek City&#13;
and Chui Oblast. For full implementation of the Issyk-kul pilot to occur, the government must ensure&#13;
that all legal and regulatory obstacles are removed. It is a condition of negotiation for the project that&#13;
a Presidential decree and Government edict are issued which remove any barriers to the implementation&#13;
of new provider payment systems in the Issyk-kul pilot. Meeting this condition requires that at least the&#13;
following three points be addressed:&#13;
(i)    Savings from rationalization of facilities or implementation of new provider payment&#13;
methods will be retained and reinvested.&#13;
(ii)    Establishment of a mechanism to enforce the pooling of funds at the national, oblast,&#13;
municipal and rayon level.&#13;
(iii)   Authority to establish new payment methods including at least the following:&#13;
(a)    The line-item budget system will not be used to reimburse providers.&#13;
(b)    Determination and resolution of conflicts with the Treasury System created by&#13;
new provider payment methods.&#13;
(c)    Capability to institute performance-based pay.&#13;
(d)    Facility management autonomy including hiring and firing.&#13;
25.   The USAID-funded Issyk-kul pilot program expects implementation to move forward rapidly after&#13;
these legal and regulatory issues are finalized. The program has experienced some problems including&#13;
turnover of local counterparts and difficulty in obtaining necessary commodities such as equipment for&#13;
Family Group Practices and computers. Most of these commodities were not included in the USAID-&#13;
funded program, so grants were secured from other donor agencies. The World Bank project should&#13;
provide enough commodities to facilitate the desired changes in behavior and produce visible change to&#13;
positively impact the attitude of the population toward health reforms.&#13;
26.   The project files contain an operational plan, accomplishments, next steps and responsible party&#13;
for the Issyk-kul demonstration as of October, 1995 (in November, 1995, progress continued on many&#13;
of the next steps).&#13;
27.    The most favorable geographic areas for extending the Issyk-kul demonstration would be Bishkek&#13;
City and Chui Oblast. These sites are preferable for several reasons: 1.) relatively dense, urban&#13;
population; 2.) most affluent geo-political units (in terms of per capita income and tax revenues paid);&#13;
3.) relative sophistication of medical institutions and trained personnel; 4.) relative excess of medical&#13;
providers, especially physicians per capita in Bishkek; 5.) contiguous geographically, effectively sharing&#13;
market areas for medical services; 6.) proximity to health sector leadership for observation and&#13;
evaluation; and, 7.) proximity to technical coordinating staff for implementation purposes under the&#13;
credit. Discussions with leadership (e.g., central and oblast-level MOH, MANAS tearn) indicated interest&#13;
and agreement in using these geographic areas as demonstration sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
182                              ANNEX 4&#13;
28.   The conceptual plan for the World Bank project outlined below closely resembles the Issyk-kul&#13;
demonstration plan, except there is no additional source of financing from an employer-based health tax.&#13;
The Kyrgyz Republic can use the base of experience from the Issyk-kul demonstration to extend the&#13;
reforms to Bishkek City and Chui Oblast. Specifics aspects of each element may not be replicated&#13;
exactly, the demographic, epidemiologic, and economic features of a different geographic area may&#13;
dictate design modifications; local preferences and values will be important as well. These differences&#13;
will be identified in the technical assistance provided to refine the Issyk-kul products to fit Bishkek City&#13;
and Chui Oblast.&#13;
29.    Problem: The health care system in the Kyrgyz Republic is dominated by the hospital sector,&#13;
which consumes more than 70% of resources. One reason for this inefficient allocation of resources is&#13;
the financial incentives for facilities contained in the current line item budgeting system. The budgeting&#13;
system is based on input measures such as number of beds and staff, and rewards increases in capacity&#13;
rather than the efficient provision of high quality health services.&#13;
30.   Purpose and Benefits: The medical care provider payment component would create financial&#13;
incentives for all providers of health services to manage care provided to patients more efficiently and&#13;
cost-effectively while maintaining or improving the quality of health services provided to the population.&#13;
Decision-making on the allocation of resources would be decentralized so that both providers of health&#13;
services and the population have more responsibility and accountability for the efficient provision of high&#13;
quality health services.&#13;
31.   The methods used to pay hospitals, polyclinics, and physicians would be changed to foster&#13;
efficiency in the health care delivery system and promote the use of primary care. Payment for care&#13;
would no longer be made on the basis of production input measures but rather on the basis of&#13;
performance as measured by services provided, or episodes of care completed. The new provider&#13;
payment methods would strengthen the connection between the quantity and quality of services provided,&#13;
and the financial reimbursement received for those services. Incentives would encourage treatment of&#13;
patients on an outpatient as opposed to inpatient basis, reduce length-of-stay for those patients who do&#13;
require hospitalization, and reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists and for diagnostic tests.&#13;
32.   Benefits resulting from achieving the goal of increasing the efficiency of the health care sector&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(i)    Ability to provide more health services with current funding levels due to more efficient&#13;
allocation of existing health sector resources.&#13;
(ii)   Increased confidence in the health sector by businesses and the population leading to&#13;
greater willingness to invest in health.&#13;
(iii)  Increased responsibility and accountability of health providers for the outcome of health&#13;
services provided to the population.&#13;
(iv)   Increased consumer participation in decisions about their health care.&#13;
(v)    Improvements in the quality of health services.&#13;
(vi)   Increased access to health services for the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
183                            ANNEX 4&#13;
(vii)   Greater satisfaction and prestige for medical professionals, including attracting and&#13;
keeping quality professionals.&#13;
33.   Provider payment reforns would change the financing and the organization of care in two&#13;
important ways. Payment for care would be separated from delivery of care. The payer would focus&#13;
on paying for the best care at the lowest cost -- it would purchase care rather than maintain facilities.&#13;
The provider would have more flexibility to focus on delivering the most optimal mix of services with&#13;
the best outcome. Secondly, providers would be "at risk" in that they would now be responsible for&#13;
differences between payments received and costs incurred. Providers would be accountable for more&#13;
efficient and higher quality of care.&#13;
34.   This provider payment component does not directly address the institution of new forms of&#13;
financing for the health sector, such as an employer tax, or the creation or organization of insurance.&#13;
General reforms already occurring in the Kyrgyz Republic exhibit a broad range of activity related to new&#13;
sources of financing and insurance. The German donor fund GTZ also is providing support and technical&#13;
assistance related to insurance. The Bank can provide only marginal benefit in including this component.&#13;
35.   Implementation: Although the Government is concerned about the level of foreign technical&#13;
assistance, by definition, the institution of new provider payment methods requires substantial technical&#13;
expertise in hospital payment, physician payment, clinical practice, cost accounting, clinical information&#13;
systems, management, finance and internal auditing, computer systems, accreditation, and quality&#13;
improvement. Although most of the products would have been developed in the Issyk-kul pilot, they will&#13;
need to be adjusted to fit Bishkek and Chui Oblast because the population composition is different.&#13;
36.   The implementation strategy of this component is to use foreign experts selectively to produce&#13;
defined products. Each product, for example hospital payment, would have a dedicated foreign expert&#13;
or module leader. Module leaders would have three goals in their work: 1.) Refine the Issyk-kul&#13;
products to fit Bishkek and Chui; 2.) provide initial training to a broad audience on the systems/products&#13;
through workshops, and intensively train a local expert in the specialty area; and 3.) work with the local&#13;
expert to implement this aspect of the project.&#13;
37.   The local expert for each programmatic area would be responsible for imnplementation of the&#13;
product and continued training of health personnel. Qualified computer specialists would support them.&#13;
They would both work for the fiscal intermediary or one of three associations formed to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of the provider payment reforms. The three associations are a Primary Care Physicians&#13;
Association, a Hospital Association, and an Accreditation Commission.  Establishing these three&#13;
organizations should contribute to the sustainability of the reforms. The Accreditation Commission needs&#13;
to be independent to objectively determine whether a facility meets the minimum standards required to&#13;
operate and receive payment for services. In the medium to long-term, the Primary Care Physicians&#13;
Association and Hospital Association will serve as representative bodies in a more decentralized, market-&#13;
oriented health sector. While the local experts serving as their employees are initially supported by the&#13;
project, they are developing marketable skills which will be in demand in the future.&#13;
38.   Description: The medical care provider payment component requires US$4.3 million in Bank&#13;
funds to implement over a four year period. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic would be required&#13;
to provide contributions in terms of staff time and expertise. Implementation of this component requires&#13;
structural change in the health services delivery system as well as development of new provider payment&#13;
systems and the corresponding fmnancial infrastructure to support them.  There are four major&#13;
programmatic elements of the medical care provider payments component encompassing both structural&#13;
change in the delivery system and new provider payment systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
184                               ANNEX 4&#13;
39.    The firt element is comprehensive restructuring of the primary care sector through the&#13;
establishment of new primary care group practices (called Family Group Practices in the Issyk-kul&#13;
pilot). Currently, there are very few general or family practitioners. A group consisting of a therapist&#13;
(internist), pediatrician, and obstetrician/gynecologist is required to provide comprehensive primary care&#13;
services. In order to reimburse providers a capitated rate for the provision of all primary health services&#13;
to an individual, a entity capable of providing the entire range of primary health services must exist.&#13;
40.    The primary care groups would be the focal point of the new provider payment methods: they&#13;
would enroll people and receive a capitated rate for providing a specified set of health services.&#13;
The financial incentive for the groups is to provide services rather than referring patients to other parts&#13;
of the health delivery system. Different models of primary care should be encouraged, and over time&#13;
clinical retraining and new medical institute curriculum will lead to the development of general and family&#13;
practitioners. The primary care groups should be independent, form voluntarily, and be organized as a&#13;
business. They can initiate the development of non-profit entities within the health sector and also&#13;
become private practitioners.&#13;
41.    Approximately 300 Family Practice Groups would be needed to serve the population of Bishkek&#13;
City and Chui Oblast, estimated at 1.6 million people. Each group would be capable of enrolling and&#13;
serving approximately 5,300 people. A significant portion of the provider payment component budget&#13;
will be directed at developing the capacity of these entities to respond to the financial incentives of the&#13;
new payment methods.&#13;
42.    The project activities included in this element are as follows:"6&#13;
(i)    Formation of a Primary Care Physicians Association to coordinate physician formation&#13;
of groups, and provide continuing education and representation for primary care&#13;
physicians. In addition, the Association would employ the local experts to implement this&#13;
element including practice managers, fundholding specialists, and computer specialists.&#13;
(ii)   Identification of potential locations for Family Practice Groups (FPGs), determination of&#13;
policies on leasing publicly owned health premises to FPGs, and initiation of process of&#13;
establishing FPGs as non-profit entities.&#13;
(iii)   Form approximately 150 FPGs in the first year of the project, 100 in the second year and&#13;
50 in the third year. Formation of the groups consists of physicians voluntarily choosing&#13;
their partners; funding minor renovations of new practice locations - allowing FPGs to&#13;
establish a separate identity and be dispersed throughout the community; funding&#13;
equipment to enable the groups to treat patients rather than refer them; funding clinical&#13;
training to increase clinical capability and begin development of a cadre of general&#13;
practitioners; and establishment of financial systems, including procurement of computers&#13;
and development of practice managers providing business skills for the groups. The&#13;
groups should be established in both urban and rural areas, the Issyk-kul experience&#13;
shows that the FPGs integrate well into the current rural health delivery system.&#13;
(iv)   Retraining of 1200 primary care physicians would occur over the first three years to&#13;
coincide with the establishment of primary care groups. Internists, pediatricians, and&#13;
obstetricians/gynecologists would receive both classroom and on-site training to improve&#13;
their capability to manage care on an outpatient basis and begin the conversion to general&#13;
16see the Gantt Chart for detailed implementation timeframe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
185                            ANNEX 4&#13;
and family practitioners. This process would be enhanced by changes in the curriculum&#13;
for medical students. Training for specialists would be offered as they begin to redefine&#13;
their role in the new health care delivery system. To develop the business skills&#13;
necessary for the FPGs, one doctor from each group as well as practice managers, at a&#13;
ratio of one for each 20 FPGs, would receive training on FPG financial and information&#13;
systems. This in-country training would be enhanced by study tours for practice managers&#13;
and primary care physicians.&#13;
43.   A clinical training center would be established and provided with equipment and materials at the&#13;
Republican Department of Continuous Medical Education (DCME) to provide clinical training to&#13;
physicians. The development and provision of clinical training materials, books, and curriculum materials&#13;
will magnify and sustain the impact of training activities.&#13;
44.   The second element is free choice of primary care provider by the population and enrollment&#13;
of the entire population into primary care groups. Participation by the population in decisions about&#13;
their health care gives providers an incentive to provide high quality services. If patients are not&#13;
satisfied, they can change providers. Information would be provided to the population to help them make&#13;
informed choices about their medical provider.&#13;
45.   The project activities included in this element are as follows:&#13;
(i)    A public awareness and marketing campaign to inform the population about FPGs and&#13;
their right to choose their physician.&#13;
(ii)   Actual enrollment of the population in FPGs and establishment of a enrollment database&#13;
for the new provider payment methods.&#13;
(iii)   Production of information comparing the performance of FPGs across various indicators,&#13;
allowing the population to evaluate providers and make educated choices.&#13;
46.   The third element is new incentive-based provider payment systems for primary care&#13;
services, outpatient specialty and ancillary servlces, and hospital services. These payment systemns&#13;
replace line item budgets for facilities with payment for health services at the patient level. Although the&#13;
experience of the Issyk-kul pilot will determine the exact form of these systems, the main concepts are&#13;
a capitated rate and case-based hospital payment. A capitated rate is the payment of a set fee to a&#13;
provider for the provision of certain health services to an individual. A case-base hospital payment&#13;
system reimburses hospitals a prospectively set fee depending on the type and severity of the treated case.&#13;
47.   Currently, national, oblast, municipal, and rayon governments finance and control their own&#13;
facilities using a budgetary system which allocates funds through predetermined functional categories such&#13;
as salaries and medical supplies. The health reforms envision the population choosing providers and&#13;
providers receiving payment for specific services provided to patients. The focus of payment for health&#13;
services changes from the facility level to the patient level. A fiscal intermediary is needed to pool the&#13;
funds from the national, oblast, municipal, and rayon sources and reimburse providers for health services&#13;
they provide to the population. Funds would no longer be delineated by government level and separately&#13;
allocated to facilities; services would be purchased by the fiscal intermediary from one pool of funds.&#13;
48.   The fiscal intermediary requires institutional capacity to pool the funds and manage the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
186                               ANNEX 4&#13;
provider payment systems. The development and installation of new computer systems is especially&#13;
important. Provider payment on a treated case basis increases the base unit for reimbursement many&#13;
times. For example, in Issyk-kul, the base unit for hospital payment will increase from budgets for about&#13;
50 facilities to payment for about 50,000 treated hospital cases. This very large increase in the number&#13;
of transactions requires the development of automated systems to manage the payment process.&#13;
49.    Current accounting systems provide a good starting point; however, they could benefit from the&#13;
introduction of accrual accounting and more sophisticated financial reporting to present available&#13;
information in a more useful form. Internal auditing and control procedures are necessary. Relationships&#13;
between the fiscal intermediary and the treasury and banking system need to be clearly defined. The&#13;
transition to a stable market economy may require the banking system to gradually shift its focus toward&#13;
handling financial transactions efficiently, away from serving as a control mechanism.&#13;
50.    The project activities included in this element are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Formation of a Accreditation Commission to license and accredit providers to operate and&#13;
receive reimbursement. In addition, the Commission would employ the local experts to&#13;
implement this element including accreditation specialists, facility surveyors, quality&#13;
assurance specialists, and computer specialists.&#13;
(ii)    Formation of a Hospital Association to represent facilities. In addition, the Association&#13;
would employ the local experts to implement this element including hospital payment&#13;
specialists, cost accounting and clinical information specialists, management specialists&#13;
and computer specialists.&#13;
(iii)   Define organizational structure, build institutional capacity, create banking relationships,&#13;
and develop regulations for the fiscal intermediary required to pool funds from different&#13;
budget sources.&#13;
(iv)   Procure computer hardware, and refine computer and accounting systems for the fiscal&#13;
intermediary. Computer systems would handle enrollment of the population, construction&#13;
of rates for the payment systems, recording of clinical information from facility bills,&#13;
payment of providers for services, operation of a quality assurance system, and analysis&#13;
of health statistics. An accounting system would record all financial transactions from&#13;
defined source payment documents, interact with the banking system and provide&#13;
financial reports for the fiscal intermediary.&#13;
(v)    Development and implementation of a rationalization plan to close or consolidate some&#13;
facilities. Rationalization should result in initial capacity reduction, alignment of facilities&#13;
to improve competition, and savings which can be invested in more equitable payment&#13;
rates for providers.&#13;
(vi)   Refine and extend the provider payment methods developed in the Issyk-kul pilot (again,&#13;
the specific design will be adapted to the environment in Bishkek City and Chui Oblast&#13;
througlWa process of evaluating options). The provider payment systems include:&#13;
(a)    A fundholding system with FPGs as fundholders receiving a capitated rate&#13;
(predetermined fee per individual for provision of a defined set of health&#13;
services) for each person enrolled. They would provide all health services&#13;
required by their enrollees either directly or by purchasing them from specialists,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
187                             ANNEX 4&#13;
diagnostic facilities, or hospitals. The capitated rate paid to FPGs would be&#13;
initially be adjusted for age and sex. FPGs would have the right to refer to any&#13;
accredited specialist or facility. To accomplish the objective of moving health&#13;
resources to the primary care sector, the FPGs would be the clinical and fmnancial&#13;
center of the health delivery system.&#13;
(b)    Payment methods for outpatient specialists and diagnostic tests. The Issyk-kul&#13;
pilot is developing a schedule of fees for different services which will serve as&#13;
the maximum amount the FPG would pay. However, these services can also be&#13;
based on rates negotiated between FPGs and specialists and providers of&#13;
diagnostic tests.&#13;
(c)    A case-based hospital payment system which could either reimburse hospitals on&#13;
a per case basis or establish a global budget based on the type and severity of&#13;
treated cases. The Medical Economic Standards system developed in Russia&#13;
should not be used. Payment on a per case basis requires a patient classification&#13;
system to group cases into categories based on clinical cohesiveness and&#13;
homogeneity of resource use. Costs are then estimated for the categories and a&#13;
relative weight calculated which reflects how much greater or less than average&#13;
the resource use is for this particular diagnosis. The relative weight for the&#13;
classified case is then used to reimburse hospitals a predetermined fee for that&#13;
particular hospital. Technical issues needing resolution include how to maintain&#13;
budget neutrality, how to avoid placing FPGs at too much risk, and&#13;
determination of other payment adjustments.&#13;
(d)    The payment systems are for operating costs only. Capital investments will&#13;
continue to be centrally allocated and can be used to enhance competition among&#13;
providers.&#13;
(e)    Determination of whether special payment approaches should be tailored to&#13;
specific categories of care under the loan program, such as tuberculosis,&#13;
ARI/CDD, or whether adjustments are needed to general payment policies for&#13;
high priority services such as preventive care.&#13;
(f)    Development of a health price index which can be used to update the payment&#13;
rates for providers.&#13;
(vii)   Approximately 100 facility managers and government officials would receive training on&#13;
the new payment methods. Intensive training would be provided for the staff of the fiscal&#13;
intermediary. This in-country training would be enhanced by a study tour on provider&#13;
payment methods.&#13;
(viii)  The Health Finance and Management Department of the Republican Department of&#13;
Continuous Medical Education (DCME) would be established as at training center for&#13;
provider payment and financial and management infrastructure. It will allow training to&#13;
be provided efficiently and build education capacity to provide the finance and&#13;
management skills needed within the health sector to sustain reforms.&#13;
51.   The fourth element is development of health sector infrastructure to support the&#13;
implementation of new provider payment systems. This infrastructure consists of three areas: 1.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
188                              ANNEX 4&#13;
integrated management information systems (MIS), such as cost accounting and clinical information&#13;
systems, to track resource use and utilization patterns and provide managers tools to improve their&#13;
decision-making ability; 2.) increased management autonomy, flexibility, and accountability for health&#13;
care providers; and, 3.) quality assurance systems to monitor care and prevent "gamning" or abuse under&#13;
different financial incentives of new provider payment systems.&#13;
52.    The project activities included in this element are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Procurement and installation of computer hardware and software for health facilities.&#13;
(ii)    Refinement and extension of the cost accounting and clinical information systems&#13;
developed in the Issyk-kul pilot. Cost accounting and clinical information systems are&#13;
needed to provide facility managers with information to make good decisions about the&#13;
type and mix of services produced by the facility. In addition, this informnation is&#13;
required by the government to determine payment rates for providers.  Finally,&#13;
improvement in financial accounting methods would allow more efficient management&#13;
of financial transactions and produce better financial reports. Training on these systems&#13;
would be provided for approximately 100 facility accountants. This in-country training&#13;
would be enhanced by a study tour on management and financial systems.&#13;
(iii)   Creation of a legal and regulatory framework to provide facilities with autonomy to&#13;
efficiently allocate payment received for health services, including the capability to hire&#13;
and fire staff and institute performance-based pay for employees. Training will be&#13;
provided for approximately 100 facility managers to help redefine organizational&#13;
structure, including the institution of some facility boards; improve resource management,&#13;
including planning and budgeting; and introduce new personnel policies.&#13;
(iv)   A licensing and accreditation program to determine the capability of a facility to provide&#13;
high quality services. The USAID-funded program is providing technical assistance to&#13;
implement a national licensing and accreditation program. The World Bank project will&#13;
fund refinement of the accreditation program, an independent Accreditation Commission,&#13;
and staff capacity to survey facilities.&#13;
(v)    Refinement and implementation of the quality assurance program developed in the Issyk-&#13;
kul pilot. Quality assurance is needed to counteract perverse financial incentives&#13;
potentially encountered under the new provider payment methods. Medical criteria and&#13;
sampling techniques would be used to ensure that referrals, hospital admissions and&#13;
discharges are appropriate. In addition, techniques for continuous quality improvement&#13;
would be implemented at the facility level.&#13;
53.    The goal of the provider payment component is to provide health services more efficiently,&#13;
producing savings which can be reinvested to improve the quality of health services and the access of the&#13;
population to health services. Determination of whether the component has achieved the desired impact&#13;
and savings in the health sector can be measured by the following indicators:&#13;
(i)    Reduction of hospital admission rate and length of stay.&#13;
(ii)    Reduction in referral rate of primary care physicians.&#13;
(iii)  Increase in proportion of health sector resources allocated to the primary care sector.&#13;
(iv)   Reduction of both number of beds and number of facilities, resulting in reduction of fixed&#13;
costs, such as utilities, in the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
189                             ANNEX 4&#13;
(v)    Number of Family Group Practices formed.&#13;
(vi)   Percentage of the population enrolled in Family Group Practices.&#13;
54.   The provider payment component needs to establish an evaluation and monitoring element to&#13;
determine the status of program implementation and measure progress toward target indicators. A&#13;
baseline study of physician referrals is necessary, as this data is not currently collected. Most of the other&#13;
baseline data is available, although a lot of effort is required to collect and compile it into a form suitable&#13;
for analysis.&#13;
55.   The central Ministry of Health (MOH) would have overall responsibility for the component with&#13;
implementation managed by the Technical Coordinating Committee (TCC). The TCC would have one&#13;
full-time advisor to coordinate all provider payment activities. Close coordination is required with several&#13;
other critical organizational components -- the central Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the oblast (city in&#13;
the case of Bishkek) level administration, Department of Health, and Department of Finance. To&#13;
facilitate collaboration between the central, oblast and city level governments, Ministry/Department of&#13;
Health, and Ministry/Department of Finance, a task force would be formed with representatives of the&#13;
various stakeholders. The World Bank, TCC, and task force would continue its close collaboration with&#13;
other relevant donors -- notably USAID, ODA ant GTZ.&#13;
56.   A smooth transition of the provider payment reforms from the Issyk-kul pilot to Bishkek City and&#13;
Chui Oblast requires continuous coordination with the USAID-funded pilot over the next year. The TCC&#13;
and task force should meet regularly with the USAID-funded team, begin work on designing the program&#13;
and adapting the Issyk-kul products, communicate with and educate officials about the design,&#13;
implementation and results of the Issyk-kul pilot, and monitor the progress of the pilot program. The&#13;
three parties should continue to work to facilitate the rapid implementation of the Issyk-kul pilot by&#13;
identifying, communicating and helping to resolve any issues which arise.&#13;
57.   The conditions of negotiation for legal and regulatory requirements to implement the Issyk-kul&#13;
pilot were discussed above. In addition, two conditions of effectiveness will help ensure collaboration&#13;
and a smooth transition from the Issyk-kul pilot program. First, the TCC will evaluate the Issyk-kul&#13;
provider payments pilot program. Second, any additional legislation or regulation blocking the way to&#13;
provider payment reforms will be identified and specific recommendations made for changes in such&#13;
legislation and regulation submitted to appropriate decision-makers.&#13;
58.   The following covenants address critical issues which will improve the potential for successful&#13;
implementation of the provider payment component:&#13;
(i)    The Borrower shall keep its level of total executed budgetary financing of the health&#13;
sector, from all sources and by all means at a level not less, in real inflation-adjusted&#13;
terms, than such total executed financing in 1994.&#13;
(ii)   The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1996, abolish the restrictive legislation&#13;
identified under the conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
(iii)   The Borrower shall not carry out the provider payments component before reaching&#13;
agreement with the Association on the modalities, taking into account its evaluation of&#13;
the Issyk-kul pilot project.&#13;
(iv)   The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1997, establish and thereafter maintain&#13;
a Health Fund into which national, oblast, municipal, and rayon level health and finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
190                             ANNEX 4&#13;
authorities would contribute and out of which medical providers will be paid, together&#13;
with regularly updated guidelines on the manner and level of contribution by these&#13;
authorities.&#13;
(v)    Not later than December 31, 1997, the Borrower shall design and implement a national&#13;
health accounts system to enable the Borrower to track the allocation of resources and the&#13;
flow of funds in the health sector.&#13;
(vi)   The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1996, issue guidelines, acceptable to&#13;
the Association, to health authorities at all levels on leasing of publicly owned health&#13;
premises to family group practices.&#13;
(vii) The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1997, pass legislation allowing&#13;
establishment of primary care groups as non-profit entities and opening of bank accounts&#13;
by such groups.&#13;
(viii) The Borrower shall, not later than December 31, 1996, carry out a study of the levels&#13;
of patient referrals from primary care physicians to specialists and for diagnostic tests in&#13;
Bishkek City and Chui Oblasts.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 5: PHARMACEUTICAL MANAGEMENT AND REFORM COMPONENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    The availability of drugs in the Kyrgyz Republic has fallen precipitously since the breakup of the&#13;
Soviet Union in 1991, caused primarily by the collapse of public finances. According to rough estimates&#13;
by Kyrgyz Pharmacia, the partly Government-owned and still Government-controlled company that&#13;
dominates the drug wholesale market in the republic, total sales in 1995 for the country as a whole should&#13;
be approximately US$ 10 million, or a little more than US$ two dollars per capita. Annual sales&#13;
reportedly totaled 80 million Russian rubles in the late 1980s, i.e. approximately US$ 120 million at the&#13;
official exchange rate, or slightly more than US$ 26 per capita.&#13;
2.    The poor availability of medicines is significantly aggravated, however, by wasteful and cost-&#13;
ineffective pharmaceutical management. There are two major sources of waste and ineffectiveness in the&#13;
current management of pharmaceuticals in the Kyrgyz Republic. One is the inadequate regulation of&#13;
drugs. When the Kyrgyz Republic was part of the Soviet Union, all drug regulatory institutions and&#13;
functions were located in Moscow; since independence, the Republic has lacked an institutional capability&#13;
to assure the safety and efficacy of medicines produced and/or distributed locally. Moreover, the danger&#13;
of ineffective, or even unsafe, medicines being supplied may be rising, in light of the worsening&#13;
economic conditions, the growing shortage of drugs, and the unscrupulousness of low-quality&#13;
manufacturers. A more serious source of waste is undisciplined, cost-ineffective public spending. Despite&#13;
cuts in government funds for drugs, the funds that are available still are being used to buy an excessively&#13;
large number of drugs, many of which have never been proven to be effective. Expensive branded drugs&#13;
are sometimes purchased instead of less expensive, therapeutically equivalent generic products. And&#13;
because a large number of different drugs are purchased in relatively small quantities, the demand for&#13;
many important, widely used medicines often is not met, while the price that must be paid to obtain these&#13;
drugs is higher than would be the case if larger quantities of fewer drugs were purchased through&#13;
competitive bidding.&#13;
3.    The pharmaceutical management component of the project is designed to improve the availability&#13;
of essential drugs in the Kyrgyz Republic both (a) directly, by financing the procurement and distribution&#13;
of a large quantity of essential drugs, and (b) indirectly, by supporting the implementation of far-reaching&#13;
reforms designed to strengthen the Government's drug regulatory capabilities and to increase the&#13;
discipline and cost-effectiveness of public spending.  Financial support for the procurement and&#13;
distribution of essential drugs is contingent on the Government's continued determination to implement&#13;
these reforms. These reforms, taken together, will lead to a significant improvement in the availability&#13;
of essential drugs in the republic and to a permanent increase in the cost effectiveness of public and&#13;
private spending on drugs--that is, the amount of health provided by any given amount of public and/or&#13;
private resources.&#13;
4.    The financing of approximately US$ 6.0 million of essential drugs, besides helping to improve&#13;
directly the availability of needed medicines, also is intended to help improve the overall efficiency of&#13;
drug distribution, by supporting, albeit indirectly, the continued restructuring and privatization of the&#13;
government monopoly previously in charge of the drug trade in the republic. In view of the large size&#13;
of the contemplated procurement, the complex procedures that will be used to implement the procurement&#13;
and the subsequent distribution of drugs need to be described and explained in detail and that is the&#13;
primary purpose of this Annex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
192                              ANNEX 5&#13;
B. Pharmaceutical Management Reforms&#13;
5.     National Drug Regulatory Organization.  The national drug regulatory authority will be&#13;
responsible for:&#13;
(a)    the registration of all drugs and vaccines manufactured and/or marketed in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, including pre-registration review of all technical information on safety and&#13;
effectiveness, the organization of clinical trials if necessary, and post-registration&#13;
monitoring of drug utilization and possible adverse drug reactions;&#13;
(b)    quality testing and quality assurance of all drugs and vaccines manufactured, imported&#13;
into, marketed, and/or otherwise distributed in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
6.     A national drug regulatory organization was established in 1993 by decree of the Prime Minister.&#13;
Located within the MOH, the organization is known officially as the Administration for Standardization&#13;
and Oversight of the Quality of Medicines and Medical Technology. The authority and responsibilities&#13;
of this organization are reaffirmed in a proposed "Law on Medicines" that has been drafted. The&#13;
Administration for Standardization includes, among its subordinate departments, a national drug testing&#13;
laboratory which is responsible for (a) providing technical support of the Administration's registration&#13;
decisions and (b) ascertaining the quality of drugs manufactures, imported, and/or otherwise distributed&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
7.     The Drug Regulatory Organization and its subordinate testing laboratory, which are co-located,&#13;
have rented 340 meters of space at the Institute of Cardiology and are negotiating with the Institute to&#13;
rent an additional 160 meters of adjoining space. With a total of approximately 500 square meters of&#13;
space, the organization will have sufficient room to perform its functions. Renovation of the premises&#13;
has begun, and a small amount of testing equipment has been procured; it will be installed when&#13;
additional renovation is completed and the necessary laboratory furniture has been acquired. Current staff&#13;
of the organization numbers 15 of a planned 35. The project will provide extensive support to enable&#13;
the organization and laboratory to become fully operational as quickly as possible. The project will&#13;
provide US$97,000 for renovation of the premises and US$357,000 for the purchase of: office furniture&#13;
and equipment; laboratory testing equipment and furniture; reagents and chemical glassware; scientific&#13;
literature, computer software, and databases; and other necessary supplies.&#13;
8.     The project will finance a substantial amount of training for the staff of the organization and&#13;
laboratory, including activities designed to foster close professional relations between officials of the&#13;
organization and counterparts in drug regulatory agencies of other countries. The project will finance&#13;
in-country training in the use of computers and databases, the use of new laboratory equipment, and cost-&#13;
effectiveness analysis for approximately 75 people during the first two years of the project. The project&#13;
also will finance approximately 50 person-weeks of training and study tours abroad, spread over four&#13;
years. In order to facilitate widespread dissemination of this information within the Kyrgyz Republic and&#13;
to support a limited amount of training for persons outside the organization and laboratory, e.g. local&#13;
health care officials, the project will finance an annual two-day national conference on drug regulatory&#13;
affairs, including participation of foreign experts.&#13;
9.    The Drug Regulatory Organization presently operates as a self-financing body, relying on incoii.-&#13;
from registration and testing fees. As a result, drug regulatory officials may have a direct economic&#13;
interest in their regulatory decisions, and this may increase the risk that ineffective, or even unsafe, drugs&#13;
will be made available to patients. Part of the costs of the drug regulatory organization can and should&#13;
continue to be financed out of registration and testing fees. The labor costs of the staff that process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
193                            ANNEX 5&#13;
registration application, the paper and other consumables used, and the labor and travel expenses of&#13;
inspectors should be financed out of registration fees. The costs of reagents and other consumables used&#13;
in laboratory analyses, as weli as the labor costs of technicians, likewise should be charges to the vendors&#13;
whose products are being tested. However, in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, the&#13;
compensation of senior drug officials and other staff with a direct voice in regulatory decisions should&#13;
be financed solely and directly from the state budget. The adoption of revised procedures for financing&#13;
the Administration for Standardization, which provide that the salaries of senior officials and regulatory&#13;
decision-makers are financed by the Government and not from fees, was a condition of negotiatons.&#13;
10.   The TCC  component coordinator for pharmaceutical management will supervise the&#13;
implementation of the various activities. In cooperation with the Chief of the Drug Regulatory&#13;
Organization, other MOH officials, and the Project Coordination Unit, the TCC component coordinator&#13;
will prepare terms-of-reference for all procurement contracts, including adequately specified lists of&#13;
equipment, furniture, supplies, and other goods to be purchased with project funds. The TCC component&#13;
coordinator will prepare, in concert with the Chief of the Drug Regulatory Organization, an annual&#13;
training plan, including the dates, location, purpose, and names of participants for all in-country training&#13;
courses and foreign study tours; the TCC component coordinator will exercise personal responsibility for&#13;
assuring that all technical and logistical requirements of the training are met. The TCC component&#13;
coordinator will maintain continual communications with other donors, in particular the WHO, in order&#13;
to minimize duplication and to maximize coordination in all drug regulatory technical assistance and&#13;
training activities. Finally, the Coordinator will, each year, convene and chair a temporary organizing&#13;
committee to prepare for and to implement the annual national conference on drug regulatory affairs.&#13;
11.   Essential Drugs Program: An Essential Drugs List (EDL), numbering 300 different products,&#13;
has been adopted as a first step toward the creation of an Essential Drugs Program (EDP). Part 1 of this&#13;
list, which has received the WHO's endorsement, consists of the 195 "most widely distributed basic&#13;
medicines" that are expected to be consistently available at, or by prescription from, all primary and&#13;
secondary health care facilities. Part 2 consists of 105 "basic medicines used in specialized institutions."&#13;
Formal adoption and publication of the EDL by the MOH, was a condition of negotiations.&#13;
12.   The draft EDL was compiled by a large ad hoc committee in the MOH and is the product of a&#13;
lengthy dialogue between the MOH and experts from the WHO and the World Bank. The process for&#13;
establishing and maintaining the EDL must now be institutionalized. The "Law on Medicines" delegates&#13;
to the MOH formal authority to compile the EDL. Final passage of this law, with this authority included,&#13;
and the adoption of formal rules and procedures for compiling and maintaining the EDL, including&#13;
provisions for its periodic review and, if necessary, revision in the future, are to be accomplished prior&#13;
to December 31, 1996.&#13;
13.   In order to become an effective means of influence over the procurement and utilization of drugs,&#13;
the EDL must be made widely available, and the rationale for an EDL must be understood clearly and&#13;
supported by physicians, pharmacists, other health care professionals, and health care financing decision-&#13;
makers. The project will support development and publication of a brochure, containing the EDL and&#13;
a lengthy commentary explaining how the List was compiled and its purpose. The project will finance&#13;
the printing and distribution of several thousand copies of the brochure, which will be made available to&#13;
all pharmacists and health facilities prior to the start of the sizable procurement of essential drugs under&#13;
the project. The project will help to finance a workshop in each oblast prior to effectiveness, in order&#13;
to introduce the EDL to local health leaders and to build professional support for an Essential Drugs&#13;
Program. In the second and fourth years of the project, revised editions of the EDL will be published&#13;
and distributed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
194                            ANNEX 5&#13;
14.   Equally necessary for effective implementation of the EDL is the development and dissemination&#13;
of new, standard medical treatment guidelines that are compatible and consistent with the limited range&#13;
of drugs included on the List. The MOH already has begun to draft new treatment guidelines, and the&#13;
project will support a study tour prior to effectiveness, designed to further this effort.&#13;
15.   Maximum benefit of the EDL will be achieved when the List becomes a principal mechanism for&#13;
regulating public spending on drugs. However, a requirement that public spending for drugs be limited&#13;
to the EDL is, for the time being, impracticable. Two years will be needed in order to train health care&#13;
professionals and to win their support and cooperation, but also in order to gain experience with the List&#13;
and to revise the List in light of this experience, as will inevitably be required. From the start of the&#13;
third year of the project, public spending on drugs will be limited to the EDL: from that date, state-&#13;
owned health facilities will be permitted to buy, and specially "entitled" ambulatory patients will be&#13;
permitted to receive free of charge or at subsidized prices, only drugs included on the Kyrgyz Republic's&#13;
Essential Drugs List. Duning negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will&#13;
formally adopt and effectively implement this rule by the beginning of 1998. At the samne time, no&#13;
restrictions will be placed on the privately-financed purchase, distribution, and sale of medicines which&#13;
are not included on the EDL.&#13;
16.   The establishment and operations of the Kyryyz Republic's Essential Drugs Program will be&#13;
undertaken and supervised by a standing commission or committee appointed by the Minister of Health,&#13;
consistent with authority provided by the proposed "Law on Medicines" and as provided by the rules to&#13;
be adopted on compiling and maintaining the EDL. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
the formation of this committee will be done by December 31, 1996. The TCC component coordinator&#13;
for pharmaceutical management will be a member of this body and will coordinate the various project&#13;
activities intended to support implementation of the EDP. In particular, the TCC component coordinator&#13;
will: (a) convene and chair a small, informal working group to oversee production and distribution of the&#13;
EDL; (b) maintain close communications with the WHO, UNICEF, and other donors in order to ensure&#13;
that foreign assistance in the development of new standard treatment guidelines is used with minimum&#13;
duplication and maximum effectiveness; and (c) convene and chair an informal working group to design&#13;
and implement a monitoring program which will include regular surveys of pharmacies and physicians&#13;
in order to measure the availability and utilization of essential drugs.&#13;
C. Drug Distribution in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
17.   The Old System: Until recently, the procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic was the exclusive responsibility of Pharmacia, a centralized, vertically integrated, semi-&#13;
commercial government corporation headquartered in Moscow that, during the Soviet period,&#13;
monopolized the drug trade throughout the former' Soviet Union. As in every other union republic,&#13;
Kyrgyz Pharmacia consisted of a central office and warehouse in the republican capital, Bishkek (then&#13;
known as Frunze); regional offices and warehouses at the oblast level; and a large network of hospital,&#13;
inter-hospital, and community (retail) pharmacies. Although concentrated disproportionately in the largest&#13;
cities, pharmacies were numerous and widely dispersed, so that medicines were generally accessible to&#13;
patients and health facilities alike, even in rural areas. The system was administered by a large cadre of&#13;
trained professional pharrnacists and pharmacy technicians.&#13;
18.   There being almost no domestic pharmaceutical industry in the Kyrgyz Republic, approximately&#13;
96-98% of the drugs distributed locally were--and are still--imported. Most shipments were delivered&#13;
to Kyrgyz Pharmacia's central warehouse in Bishkek, where they were divided into lots and onward&#13;
shipped to the oblast Pharmacias which, in turn, acted as distributors for the pharmacies and health care&#13;
facilities located in their respective regions. In Chui Oblast, the regional Pharmacia recently was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
195                             ANNEX 5&#13;
disbanded; the national office of Kyrgyz Pharmacia now supplies pharmnacies and health care facilities&#13;
located in Chui Oblast, as well as those in Bishkek city, out of its central warehouse.&#13;
19.   At the point of distribution to patients, the pharmacy system functioned--and continues to&#13;
function--like that in most countries. In hospitals, physicians ordered or prescribed drugs which were&#13;
supplied by the hospital pharmacy or, if the hospital was too small to warrant its own pharmacy, by the&#13;
inter-hospital pharmacy designated as the hospital's regular supplier. [It should be remembered that these&#13;
pharmacies, although physically located in the hospitals, belonged to the Pharmacia system, not the&#13;
Ministry of Health or local health department.] In similar fashion, out-patients could have their&#13;
prescriptions filled at any retail pharmacy, although some pharmacies specialized in particular illnesses&#13;
or patient groups.&#13;
20.   Relatively few patients paid for their medicines. By law, all drugs dispensed in hospitals were&#13;
(are) supposed to be provided to patients free of charge; and there was (is) a long list of ambulatory&#13;
patients similarly entitled to receive medicines free of charge or at heavily subsidized prices. The&#13;
entitlement list has been frequently amended but usually has consisted of approximately 20 categories of&#13;
illness--e.g. dysentery, bronchial asthma, AIDS--and anywhere from 15 to 30 population groups-e.g.&#13;
World War n veterans, Chernobyl victims, children up to the age of three. Overall, before the breakup&#13;
of the Soviet Union, probably 80-90% of all drugs consumed in the republic were dispensed to patients&#13;
at no charge.&#13;
21.   However, while mostly free to patients, drugs were not free--at least not on paper--to the&#13;
pharmacies and health care facilities that dispensed them. The hospital "bought" drugs from its pharmacy&#13;
at controlled prices equal to the pharmacy's acquisition cost plus a standard, fixed markup to cover&#13;
operating expenses. The hospital generally "paid" the pharmacy out of its own budget, although&#13;
sometimes the pharmacy was paid directly by the city or oblast health department. Funds needed to cover&#13;
these costs, i.e. the fiscal cost of drugs supplied to in-patients, have long been appropriated separately&#13;
under Article 10 of the republic and oblast health budgets. A similar payment mechanism functioned in&#13;
the case of exempted ambulatory patients. Every month, retail pharmacies billed the city or oblast health&#13;
department for the cost of drugs dispensed to exempted out-patients, again based on prices equal to&#13;
acquisition cost plus a standard markup. The anticipated fiscal cost of treating these patients was included&#13;
in Article 10 budgets as well. [Pharmacies also sold drugs for cash to patients who were not exempt&#13;
from payment, although these receipts reportedly constituted a relatively small portion of total revenues.]&#13;
22.   The financing of drug procurement was based largely on this system of inter-organizational&#13;
payments. Hospital and retail pharmacies bought drugs from their oblast Pharmacia, paying out of&#13;
revenues received from their local health department (for the treatment of exempted patients) and from&#13;
cash-paying customers. Oblast Pharmacias, in turn, botight their drugs from Kyrgyz Pharmacia's republic&#13;
warehouse and paid out of the revenues they received from their pharmacies. The Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
Pharmacia bought drugs from the national Pharmacia in Moscow. In this fashion, the procurement and&#13;
distribution of drugs were financed indirectly by: (1) the republic's consolidated health budget line&#13;
appropriations for drugs, i.e. the sum of all Article 10 appropriations; and (2) a comparatively much&#13;
smaller amount of private spending on drugs.&#13;
23.   In addition, given the controls on prices, finances at each level of the system and in each&#13;
institution were expected to be more or less in balance; that is, for any given oblast Pharmacia or&#13;
individual pharmacy, total revenues ought to have been approximately equal to total operating (non-&#13;
capital) costs. In practice, the system's finances were often not in balance. Some Pharmacias and&#13;
pharmacies earned "excess" revenues which, if discovered, generally were confiscated by the tax&#13;
authorities; others accumulated arrears, caused by various contingencies, including late or non-payment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
196                             ANNEX 5&#13;
by local health authorities. Although the managers of loss-making enterprises might be disciplined, or&#13;
even fired on occasion, the arrears apparently had no financial consequences nor any effect on the supply&#13;
of drugs. At the end of the year, financial imbalances were invariably cleared and debts written off;&#13;
excess earners had their surplus taken away, those in debt were given added funds, and the cycle began&#13;
again.&#13;
24.   Post Independence: When the Soviet Union broke up and Kyrgyzstan became an independent&#13;
republic, this accounting system suddenly began to work as a financing system as well. The republic&#13;
Pharmacia's debts no longer were covered automatically by Moscow, and the republic's traditional&#13;
suppliers--mostly Russian and Ukrainian manufacturers--no longer would ship drugs to the Bishkek&#13;
warehouse without strong assurances they would be paid. Increasingly, pre-payment in a convertible&#13;
currency has been required. In order to maintain the same volume of supply as before, either the&#13;
republican company (now known as Kyrgyz Pharmacia) needs to receive sufficient income from its&#13;
subordinate companies and to be able to convert the revenue into a useable currency; or the Kyrgyz&#13;
Govermnent needs to make up the shortfall directly, either from its budget or by means of a credit. In&#13;
fact, economic depression and the Government's strong fiscal stabilization policy have, in combination,&#13;
prevented the direct subsidization of Kyrgyz Pharmacia and have led, in addition, to a significant decline&#13;
in public spending overall, including consolidated Article 10 appropriations. As a result, receipts to&#13;
Kyrgyz Pharmacia and to each oblast Pharmacia, financed out of public spending and measured in&#13;
constant prices, have fallen substantially.&#13;
25.   As public spending on drugs has fallen, private spending has grown. Informal sources claim that&#13;
as much as 50 percent or more of the drugs consumed in the republic's hospitals are paid for out of&#13;
pocket by the patients or their families. In a 1994 survey sponsored by the British foreign assistance&#13;
agency, ODA, nearly three-fifths of 285 respondents who reported having been hospitalized in the&#13;
previous year claimed to have spent at least US$ five dollars to obtain drugs prescribed during their&#13;
hospital stay. Nevertheless, total spending on drugs has, by all available evidence, declined dramatically.&#13;
Kyrgyz Pharmacia and the oblast Pharmacias are still the only significant distributors in the republic, and&#13;
their current budgets are but a fraction of what they were previously, before independence.&#13;
26.   At the level of health care facilities and patients, the availability of drugs has worsened&#13;
commensurately. Although most hospitals, especially in major urban centers, reportedly have been able&#13;
to maintain minimum supplies of essential drugs, it supposedly has become a common practice, especially&#13;
in "elective" procedures, to present the patient a list of necessary supplies, including drugs, which the&#13;
patient him or herself must supply before care is provided. Previously, it was thought that the policy of&#13;
free in-patient drugs was a cause of excessive hospitalization rates and long average lengths of stay; now,&#13;
the diminishing supply of drugs probably is a cause of the decline observed in the use of hospital services.&#13;
Exempted ambulatory patients have experienced a similar decline in availability. Some physicians&#13;
reportedly have reduced their prescribing, not wanting to add to the frustrations of their patients or to&#13;
their facilities' debts; and some pharmacies reportedly have refused to dispense drugs to exempted&#13;
patients, often claiming stock outages. Supplies nominally reserved for exempt patients reportedly have&#13;
been diverted from state to the new private pharmacies where they are sold at market-clearing prices.&#13;
27.   Kyrgyz Government Policy:  In response to the worsening drug situation, the Kyrgyz&#13;
Government is making what appears to be a serious effort to break up the Pharmacia system. The plan&#13;
is to make each level of the system independent, to fully commercialize the various successor companies,&#13;
and gradually to privatize them. The central office and warehouse, Kyrgyz Pharmacia, and the five&#13;
oblast Pharnnacias have each been made into an independent, joint-stock company. Most hospital&#13;
pharmacies have been formally transferred to the facilities in which they are located or to the&#13;
corresponding oblast health department. At the retail level, some pharmacies have been auctioned off&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
197                             ANNEX 5&#13;
for cash, others have been privatized "administratively," i.e. given to their employees, and still others&#13;
remain the property of their parent Pharmacias. Kyrgyz Pharmacia, for example, operates 33 pharmacies&#13;
in the city of Bishkek. In addition, a number of new, private pharmacies have appeared, mainly in&#13;
Bishkek where, according to Kyrgyz Pharmacia officials, new entrants may account for as much as 30&#13;
percent of local sales.&#13;
28.   The restructuring of Pharmacia is far from complete.  Kyrgyz Pharmacia and the oblast&#13;
companies still are the only significant local distributors active in the republic. Also, the financial&#13;
condition of most of the system reportedly is weak, aggravated in particular by the Govermnent's&#13;
insistence that all of the inherited debt be fully apportioned to the successor companies. Especially&#13;
vulnerable are the oblast Pharmacias which reportedly owe Kyrgyz Pharmacia approximately US$5&#13;
million for previous deliveries, and whose warehouses are described as nearly empty for lack of working&#13;
capital. Moreover, despite decentralization, the influence of government in Pharmacia operations remains&#13;
very strong. For examnple, on paper only 35 percent of the stock of Kyrgyz Pharmacia belongs to the&#13;
national Government; another 35 percent has been assigned to the company's employees; and the&#13;
remaining 30 percent supposedly has been sold to private investors, including several foreign firms. Yet,&#13;
the shares assigned to employees have not yet been distributed, leaving management solidly in control&#13;
of those votes; neither management nor the Government will identify the private investors who have&#13;
bought shares; and it is abundantly clear to any casual observer that informal relations between senior&#13;
managers at Kyrgyz Pharmacia and senior officials in the Ministry of Health and elsewhere in government&#13;
remain extremely close and cooperative. At the oblast level, where the level of government ownership&#13;
is said to be as high as 70 percent, relations must be even tightel&#13;
29.   On the other hand, the drug distribution system obviously is in transition, and the changes made&#13;
so far are significant and clearly in the right direction, for there can be no doubt that a privately-owned,&#13;
competitive system of drug wholesalers and retailers is likely to operate far more efficiently and cost&#13;
effectively than one run by the Government. At the same time, the effects of continued strong&#13;
government control over the Pharmacia companies should not be misconstrued or overstated. The oblast&#13;
governments in Naryn and Osh, for example, may exercise a decisive voice in the operations of "their"&#13;
Pharmacias, as strong or stronger than the national Government's voice in Kyrgyz Pharmacia. But these&#13;
three governments are today much less unified and in sync with one another than they were previously&#13;
under Communism. More important, the Pharmacia monopoly has been broken, and competition at all&#13;
levels is rising. The oblast Pharmacias no longer buy exclusively from Kyrgyz Pharmacia, but&#13;
increasingly are engaging in direct negotiations with traditional Pharmacia suppliers (chiefly Russian&#13;
manufacturers) and with the old and new distributors that have proliferated throughout the NIS. Kyrgyz&#13;
Pharnacia, for its part, has begun to compete with its former oblast subordinates over supply contracts&#13;
with pharmacies and health care facilities. Probably it is only a matter of time before the oblast&#13;
Pharmacias reach out across oblast borders and begin to compete directly with one another.&#13;
30.   Apart from organizational questions, the Government's response to the worsening drug situation&#13;
has been much more tepid. Particularly disappointing has been the marked lack of interest shown in&#13;
reviewing and revising the exemptions policy that promises free in-patient drugs to all and free out-patient&#13;
drugs to as much as two-thirds of the population. The effects of this exemptions policy and the prospects&#13;
of change will be discussed in more detail below. Here, the following should be said. First, although&#13;
very generous on paper, the Government's drug entitlement policy has become seriously under-funded&#13;
in practice, with the result that fewer patients than before are getting free or subsidized drugs, while&#13;
many formally exempt patients are having to pay for them. However, the cuts in supply have been&#13;
implemented in an ad hoc, and therefore haphazard, f-shion. As a result, some relatively affluent&#13;
patients who could--and would--pay for their drugs still are getting them free of charge, while many very&#13;
poor patients are having to pay or to do without. Meanwhile, free drugs still are being dispensed in cases&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
198                             ANNEX 5&#13;
of non-urgent care, when in cases requiring immediate attention the necessary drugs are unavailable.&#13;
Such outcomes are neither equitable nor cost-effective in terms of health policy.&#13;
31.   Nor is the system any more rational in terms of budget and finance policy, for there is virtually&#13;
no connection between the cost of the exemptions and actual spending decisions. The Ministry of Health&#13;
continues to calculate annual drug needs of the population--i.e., what is required to satisfy the&#13;
Government's obligations in this area--and to convey this information to the Parliament. But the Ministry&#13;
has made no effort to rank in order of priority the exemptions or associated demand for drugs, and&#13;
because resources are wholly inadequate to fully fund the Ministry's requests, the national Parliament's&#13;
Article 10 appropriations have been based mainly on the previous year's budget and the current year's&#13;
anticipated revenues. At the same time, decisions by the national Parliament are mainly indicative, not&#13;
prescriptive, for most health spending is budgeted and financed locally where the cost of exemptions is&#13;
not calculated and where the connection between these costs and spending decisions is virtually non-&#13;
existent.  In theory, the substance of an entitlements policy and its financing should be closely&#13;
coordinated. In practice, the Kyrgyz Government's present approach to drug entitlements precludes such&#13;
coordination, virtually assuring that the cost of patient exemptions and the financing of those exemptions&#13;
will be permanently out of sync.&#13;
32.   Summary: There exists in the Kyrgyz Republic a well-developed drug distribution system that&#13;
is professionally run and easily accessible to health facilities and most of the population. This system is&#13;
in transition, and while much ground remains to be covered, the pace of change is impressive and its&#13;
direction is decidedly progressive. The weaknesses in the current system, apart from its incomplete&#13;
restructuring, should not be minimized. There probably are too many retail pharmacies in operation, and&#13;
some will likely have to be closed as uneconomical. The system's technological level is generally low;&#13;
accounting, pricing, anti inventory operations especially need to be computerized. The professional&#13;
training of most pharmacists is similarly inadequate. The growing emphasis on primary and preventive&#13;
care, combined with recent advances in drug therapy, demand that pharmacists play an increasingly active&#13;
role in treatment decisions, but this will require that local pharmacists receive much more preparation in,&#13;
for example, clinical pharmacology. Perhaps most serious for the immediate future is the near-total&#13;
absence of professionals trained in the economics, finances, and management of drug procurement and&#13;
distribution.&#13;
33.   However, on balance the strengths of the existing system seem more impressive than its&#13;
weaknesses, and this has decided implications for the project. Clearly it is unnecessary, and probably&#13;
it would be counterproductive, to encourage the formation of a new mechanism to handle the procurement&#13;
and distribution of essential drugs financed under the project. Indeed, care should be taken not to impede&#13;
or undermine the generally progressive changes now taking place in the Pharmacia system. Particularly&#13;
undesirable, from the standpoint of thefuture effectiveness of the Kyrgyz Republic's health system, would&#13;
be the inadvertent reconstitution of a government monopoly in charge of the drug trade. In addition,&#13;
there are embedded in this system well-established principles and mechanisms of accounting and&#13;
financing, including means of cost recovery. Cost recovery in practice is limited by the Government's&#13;
exemption policy and will improve only when that policy is changed and fewer patients are entitled to&#13;
receive free drugs. Sufficient mechanisms for cost recovery already exist, however, and do not need to&#13;
be created or encouraged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
199                             ANNEX 5&#13;
D. The Procurement and Distribution of Essential Drugs Under the Project&#13;
34.   The project will make available approximately $US 6.9 million (including contingencies) to&#13;
finance the purchase and distribution of essential drugs. The purpose is twofold: to help ensure minimum&#13;
health standards during the most wrenching phase of the country's transition to democracy and a market&#13;
economy, when social and economic dislocations are the most severe; and to reinforce needed reforms&#13;
specifically in the health sector, aimed at raising the efficiency and cost-effectiveness with which public&#13;
funds are used.&#13;
35.   There exist, in principle, a variety of ways by which essential drugs might be procured and&#13;
distributed. The Association and the Government have agreed that several key principles must be&#13;
observed, regardless of the method chosen:&#13;
(i)    Only the most essential, cost-effective drugs should be purchased in&#13;
order to maximize the health effects of the available funds;&#13;
(ii)    Drugs procured under the project should be sold to distributors, and then&#13;
to the public, at near-market prices in order to prevent their diversion to&#13;
neighboring countries or the black market;&#13;
(iii)   Prices to health care facilities should be limited in order to maximize availability;&#13;
(iv)   Final retail prices to ambulatory patients, except in the case of exempted&#13;
patients, should be unrestricted in order to limit market distortions and&#13;
to raise the maximum amount of additional private spending;&#13;
(v)    Drugs procured under the project should be made equally available to all&#13;
regions in the republic;&#13;
(vi)   Drugs procured under the project should be made equally available to all&#13;
onward distributors and retailers, regardless of their form of ownership.&#13;
36.   With these principles in mind, and taking into account the strengths, weaknesses, and ongoing&#13;
changes in the existing drug distribution system, the Association and the Government have agreed&#13;
tentatively to procure and distribute drugs financed under the project in the following manner. All final&#13;
arrangements must be reviewed and approved by the Association prior to effectiveness. In addition, these&#13;
rules and procedures will be reviewed by the Association at the end of each procurement cycle and&#13;
revised, if necessary, by mutual agreement with the Kyrgyz Government, so as to ensure that new,&#13;
financially viable, privately-owned drug wholesalers and retailers are in no way disadvantages, compared&#13;
to remaining state-owned companies.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
37.   (1) In order to minimize supply shocks, the $US 6.9 million to be provided under the project&#13;
(including contingencies) will be spent in four annual tranches of approximately $US 2.25 million in each&#13;
of the first two project years and $US 1.2 million annually in the third and fourth years. (2) Drugs will&#13;
- be procured on the basis of International Competitive Bidding and in accordance with World Bank rules&#13;
on pharmaceutical procurement and standard World Bank documentation. (3) Procurement will be&#13;
executed by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). (4) Drugs procured under the project will be selected&#13;
exclusively from Part 1 of the Essential Drug List of the Kyrgyz Republic, "A List of the Most Widely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
200                              ANNEX 5&#13;
Distributed Basic Medicines.' (5) A list of drugs to be purchased under each tranche will be approved&#13;
by the Association and published in Development Business prior to preparation of the bidding documents.&#13;
(6) To be eligible for consideration, drugs must be registered in the republic before the evaluation of&#13;
proposals. (7) In order to give potential vendors sufficient time to register their drugs, bidding documents&#13;
for the initial tranche will be prepared prior to effectiveness or six months after the initial procurement&#13;
list is published, whichever comes later; in the case of subsequent tranches, there will be at least a 4-&#13;
month period between publication of the initial procurement list and preparation of the bidding&#13;
documents. (8) Procurements will be divided into six lots, according to a formula approved by the&#13;
Association prior to effectiveness; winning vendors will deliver shipments, in accordance with this&#13;
formula, to Naryn Oblast Pharmacia, Issyk-kul Oblast Pharmacia, Osh Oblast Pharmacia, Talas Oblast&#13;
Pharmacia, Dzhalal-Abad Oblast Pharmacia, and Kyrgyz Pharmacia (for onward distribution in Chui&#13;
Oblast and Bishkek city)--hereafter, these recipients are called the "Distributors"; bidders' prices will&#13;
include the cost of transportation and delivery to these destinations. (9) Drugs will be sold to the&#13;
Distributors on credit, based on an agreement to be included in the bidding documents and approved by&#13;
the Association ptior to effectiveness. (10) All drugs must be labeled in Russian; all packages must&#13;
include a standard insert in Russian; all individual packs, packages, and shipping containers must be&#13;
labeled; and all labels must indicate the product is an "Essential Drug of the Kyrgyz Republic."&#13;
38.   (11) Distributors will divide the shipments further and sell individual lots to hospitals, other health&#13;
care facilities, and community pharmacies at a price no higher than the acquisition cost plus a 5-percent&#13;
markup for storage and handling; Distributors will be permitted to refuse to sell or ship to any institution&#13;
or organization unable to assure full payment or reimbursement. (12) Kyrgyz Pharmacia will onward&#13;
ship drugs to health care facilities and pharmacies in Chui oblast and Bishkek city, according to rules&#13;
agreed to by the PCU; these rules will be reviewed by the Association prior to effectiveness. (13) Retail&#13;
pharmacies will be permitted to sell drugs procured under the project to non-exempt ambulatory patients&#13;
at unrestricted prices. (14) Revenues received by Distributors from the sale of drugs procured under the&#13;
project will be taxed in accordance with a special written formula agreed to by the Ministry of Health&#13;
and the Ministry of Finance; this formula will reserve fixed percentages of gross revenues for (a) the&#13;
retirement of the Distributors' outstanding debts and (b) additions to the Distributors' working capital;&#13;
the formula must be approved by the Association prior to effectiveness.&#13;
Alternative Methods of Distribution&#13;
39.   As noted, there are other ways that essential drugs might be procured and distributed under the&#13;
project; when examined closely, however, these turned out to be either significantly more complicated&#13;
and expensive administratively, at odds with one or more of the goals or principles of the project as&#13;
described above, or simply impractical. For example, one proposal considered at length was to establish&#13;
a Drug Revolving Fund (DRF), a quasi-public corporation that would attempt to sell as many of the drugs&#13;
as possible in order to maximize cost recovery. The idea ultimnately was rejected for several reasons.&#13;
Since there already exists in the Kyrgyz Republic a well-developed, accessible, and professionally&#13;
operated drug distribution system, there would seem to be little advantage in creating a new structure,&#13;
particularly one that would require considerable oversight by the Government and the Association.&#13;
Moreover, in view of the restructuring and ongoing privatization of the existing system, it surely would&#13;
be counterproductive to at this point in time encourage the Government to get back into the drug trade.&#13;
Finally, as previously discussed, there already exist well-established principles and mechanisms of cost&#13;
recovery. What limits cost recovery in practice is the Government's exemption policy, and the creation&#13;
of a DRF would not, by itself, alter this fact.&#13;
40.   Another possibility would be for the Government to procure drugs through the PCU, as currently&#13;
envisioned; and then to sell the drugs at cost to Kyrgyz Pharmacia and to let Kyrgyz Pharmacia distribute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
201                             ANNEX 5&#13;
them according to general guidelines and/or specific tasks, as agreed to in a contract with the&#13;
Government. The chief difficulty with this idea is that Kyrgyz Pharmacia very likely would choose not&#13;
to participate, i.e. would not buy the drugs at a price equal to the procurement cost, because it probably&#13;
would not be profitable to do so. [If it were profitable, then Kyrgyz Pharmacia would not need the&#13;
Association to help finance the procurement.] One reason is that even generic products bought under the&#13;
project are likely to be significantly more expensive than many of the drugs Kyrgyz Pharmacia presently&#13;
buys from Russian manufacturers--drugs which, in most cases, will not be eligible for procurement under&#13;
the project because the factories in question do not meet the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices&#13;
(GMPs). Another reason is that because the drugs purchased under the project all will be Essential&#13;
Drugs, many will end up being dispensed to exempted in- or out-patients. [Even if there was sufficient&#13;
demand from non-exempt patients, it would be wholly impractical to try to sell project-financed drugs&#13;
to cash-paying customers, while distributing free of charge to exempt patients the very same drugs&#13;
procured with budget funds.] The ability of distributors and pharmacies to make money from the sale&#13;
of project-financed drugs will depend significantly on the ability and willingness of local health authorities&#13;
to use their Article 10 funds to buy these products.&#13;
41.   A third possibility, closely related to the second, would be for the Government to onward sell&#13;
the drugs to Kyrgyz Pharmacia at subsidized prices, e.g. through a concessionary on-lending arrangement&#13;
similar to what is presently envisioned vis-a-vis the oblast Pharnacias. The main objection here is&#13;
political, namely: why undermine the progressive restructuring of the Pharmacia system that is now&#13;
taking place, by giving the entire subsidy to Kyrgyz Pharmacia which already dominates the wholesale&#13;
market and which appears to be doing reasonably well financially, particularly when compared to the&#13;
now-independent oblast Pharmacias? If a subsidy is to be provided-as probably it must, if project-&#13;
financed drugs are to be onward distributed--surely it would be more sensible to try to reinforce the&#13;
progressive changes occurring in the republic's pharmaceutical market by giving most of the subsidy to&#13;
Kyrgyz Pharmacia's prospective, but financially weaker, competitors.&#13;
42.   A fourth possibility would be for the Government to procure drugs through the PCU, perhaps&#13;
hiring Kyrgyz Pharmacia physically to receive shipments; and then to auction the drugs to any and all&#13;
bidders, subject only to the provision that they subsequently distribute the drugs exclusively within the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. For reasons already discussed, it is likely that the drugs distributed in this manner&#13;
would be sold at prices significantly below their procurement cost, so that the buyers would in effect&#13;
receive a subsidy. However, in this case the Government would not be able to choose the recipients of&#13;
the subsidy (Kyrgyz Phannacia would likely gamer a sizable percentage), nor would it be able to prevent&#13;
the subsequent distribution of the drugs disproportionately in the republic's richest markets (i.e. Bishkek)&#13;
to the disadvantage of other, less wealthy regions.&#13;
E. The Kyrgyz Government's Drug Exemptions Policy&#13;
43.   It has been noted several times previously that potentially adequate mechanisms of cost recovery&#13;
for drugs bought with public funds already exist, and that cost recovery has been limited severely in&#13;
practice by the Government's generous policy of exempting large numbers of patients from paying the&#13;
full cost of their drugs. Although this policy is now seriously under-funded, which has led to rationing&#13;
in practice, the cuts in funding and supplies have been distributed in a largely ad hoc, haphazard fashion&#13;
that has been both inequitable and cost-ineffective in its effects. The rationalization of this policy, i.e.&#13;
the reduction of exemptions and/or their cost to what the Government's consolidated health budget can&#13;
presently afford, would very likely have a net positive impact on the population's health status, by&#13;
increasing the cost-effectiveness of public spending on drugs. Rationalization of the present exemptions&#13;
policy would, in addition: (a) remove a significant barrier to entry into the drug trade by private&#13;
entrepreneurs who fear becoming saddled with obligations that could threaten their profitability; (b)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
202                              ANNEX 5&#13;
eliminate a major cause of the financial weakness of existing pharmacies and drug wholesalers; and (c)&#13;
lead to an increase in private spending on drugs by patients and institutions that may be able and willing&#13;
to buy drugs on the open market "out of pocket," but that are presently able to satisfy their drug&#13;
requirements at less than full cost by taking advantage of the Government's subsidy. [The need to re-&#13;
connect the substance of the exemptions policy with the financing of this policy, as discussed earlier, is&#13;
a separate issue from the need to reduce the fiscal cost of the exemptions policy, although changes in&#13;
either one will affect the other, and so both issues will have to be considered together.] Given these&#13;
prospective benefits, the question needs to be asked, to what extent can or should changes in the&#13;
Governments's exemptions policy be encouraged under the project?&#13;
44.    Analytically, the fiscal cost of this policy might be reduced in one or both of two ways: either&#13;
the list of exemptions (exempted patients) can be cut; or the cost of those exemptions can be reduced,&#13;
e.g by introducing co-financing by recipients (co-payments, deductibles) and/or by restricting eligibility&#13;
to the poor through means-testing. Either approach is very likely to run into difficult political and&#13;
technical obstacles in practice. Thus, there are strong public health reasons for keeping the treatment of&#13;
communicable diseases free; there are equally strong political reasons for continuing to exempt war&#13;
veterans; and there are good economic and ethical reasons for exempting high-cost cancer drugs that&#13;
could quickly bankrupt even the most affluent of patients. As evidenced already by the long struggle to&#13;
compile the Essential Drugs List, every exemption category will have its defenders, on professional and&#13;
political grounds, and paring the list in more than a symbolic way will be no mean feat. Nor will it be&#13;
much easier to reduce the cost of the policy. For example, a very nominal, standard dispensing fee could&#13;
be introduced, payable by all recipients; but it would be difficult politically to institute a fee large enough&#13;
to raise a significant amount of money. Anything more elaborate--e. g. a variable co-payment (deductible)&#13;
based on the price of the drug or the income of the patient--could lead to undesirable prescribing and/or&#13;
dispensing behavior, or would become enmeshed in the same problems involved in efforts to limit&#13;
eligibility (see below).&#13;
45.    The most commonly advocated--and, at first glance, seemingly the simplest and most powerful-&#13;
way to rationalize exemptions policy would be to limit exemptions to the poor and to require all others&#13;
to pay for their drugs. [However, even at the level of general principles, there will be opponents arguing&#13;
that health care, including the provision of essential drugs, has always been and should remain a "right,"&#13;
not a commodity.] Ordinarily, this would be a goal for the future, not a task for the present, because&#13;
it usually is extremely complicated administratively and expensive to implement means-testing in a&#13;
country like the Kyrgyz Republic, where a very high percentage of personal income normally is&#13;
concealed, corruption is rife, and cooperation between different agencies of government is minimal.&#13;
Nevertheless, in the course of the "social safety net" project, also supported by the World Bank, two&#13;
broad classes of families have been identified, based on their income and need for supplementary public&#13;
assistance; this same classification system, some have suggested, could be used to limit eligibility for drug&#13;
benefits, and perhaps other social benefits as well. Thus, families receiving aid from the Social Security&#13;
Ministry also could be designated as eligible to receive free or subsidized drugs, while all others could&#13;
be required to pay for their drugs out of pocket.&#13;
46.   In fact, instituting such a policy would be difficult. For one thing, it is unlikely that non-exempt&#13;
patients would be made to pay for the treatment of serious communicable diseases, and the continued full&#13;
exemption of these categories of patients will reduce the fiscal savings of such a change in policy. Much&#13;
more important, however, is the fact that the cost of drugs for individuals and families--like the cost of&#13;
other medical services, but unlike the cost of food, shelter, clothing, and transportation--is highly variable&#13;
and unpredictable. In any given year, a few individuals and families will need no drugs; many will need&#13;
drugs costing a small amount; some will need drugs costing more; a few will need drugs costing a lot;&#13;
and a very few will need drugs costing an enormous amount.  Accordingly, there will be strong&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
203                              ANNEX 5&#13;
pressures: (a) to cap the financial risk of any individual or family, by establishing a ceiling on monthly&#13;
out-of-pocket expenditures for drugs covered by whatever exemption categories remain; and (b) to grade&#13;
an individual's or family's financial risk according to income or cost of treatment, by introducing a&#13;
variable co-payment required of non-exempt patients, applicable until the ceiling on total out-of-pocket&#13;
expenditures has been reached, and based on the patients' income. Instituting even a simple cap on&#13;
financial risk, although a simple concept in theory, would be a huge administrative headache and&#13;
expensive; the complexity and cost of more elaborate schemes would rise geometrically.&#13;
47.   In the present context it might still make sense to press for introduction of the simple, two-class&#13;
system for regulating exemptions, if it could be shown that the financial savings would be significant.&#13;
Unfortunately, this information does not presently exist. Indeed, not even crude estimates of the potential&#13;
savings can be calculated until: (a) reliable data are collected on drug utilization at the patient level; and&#13;
(b) a decision is made concerning which exemption categories will be maintained even for the [non-&#13;
exempt" (i.e. families not receiving public assistance).&#13;
48.   There is within the Government and among health professionals widespread awareness that the&#13;
current exemptions policy is far more expensive than the budget presently can afford and that it needs&#13;
to be changed. However, there is no consensus yet as to how this should be done, nor does the issue&#13;
appear to be a high priority on the Government's agenda. Whether there is sufficient political will to&#13;
tackle this issue now is, therefore, open to question.&#13;
F. Expected Impact of the Project&#13;
49.   Ironically, the fiscal cost of the Government's present exemptions policy should decline under&#13;
the project regardless, as a consequence of the introduction of the Essential Drugs Programn, and&#13;
particularly at the start of the third year of tl . project when public spending will be limited exclusively&#13;
to those drugs contained on the Essential Drugs List. As discussed previously, a significant, sustained&#13;
improvement in the cost-effectiveness of public spending on drugs is the most important expected benefit&#13;
of the pharmaceutical management component. In addition, the procurement and distribution of $US 6.9&#13;
million of essential drugs will have an impact on the physical availability of drugs during the project, on&#13;
the composition of available supply, and on the financial viability of the distribution system; and these&#13;
impacts need to be considered separately.&#13;
50.   Total Physical Supply. Because the drugs are to be sold--either for cash or for reimbursement&#13;
from Article 10 funds--there is likely to be only a modest increase in the total physical supply of drugs&#13;
in the republic as a result of the project. Consider the following: unless drugs are given away, total&#13;
physical supply will be a function of aggregated public and private spending. As a condition of the&#13;
project, the Government will assure that aggregated public spending will fall no lower than 1994 levels&#13;
measured in constant prices. There already is a sizable amount of private spending; and the project will&#13;
almost certainly have both positive and negative first-order effects on that spending. Specifically, the&#13;
impact will be negative, insofar as some cash-paying patients will be able to get the same drugs they are&#13;
buying now more cheaply; and it will be positive, insofar as other cash-paying patients are likely to spend&#13;
more in order to obtain needed drugs that should be more available and more attractively priced than&#13;
before. Sellers, in the meantime, will want to maximize their profits; if they are unsure about the&#13;
prospects of reimbursement by local governments, they will likely try to divert as much as possible of&#13;
their stock to cash-paying customers and to price their drugs at market-clearing levels. Intuitively, it&#13;
seems likely that the net impact of the project will be (1) to increase total private spending, and (2) to&#13;
depress prices somewhat (which will raise the buying power of both public and private spending); the&#13;
total physical supply of drugs should rise as a result.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
204                               ANNEX 5&#13;
51.    Composition of Total Supply. Because drugs procured under the project will be Essential&#13;
Drugs, a significant percentage is likely to be dispensed to exempted patients and, in turn, financed out&#13;
of local health budgets. Thus, if total public spending for drugs remains constant, a higher percentage&#13;
of that spending will be used to buy Essential Drugs--specifically those drugs procured under the project-&#13;
even prior to the third year of the project when the Government is required to limit public spending&#13;
exclusively to the drugs contained on the republic's Essential Drugs List. By the same token, a smaller&#13;
percentage of aggregated public spending will be available to support the purchase of drugs NOT supplied&#13;
under the project. In addition, because the oblast Pharmacias will be receiving drugs at very low cost,&#13;
it may become more difficult for other distributors to sell the same drugs profitably, i.e. at a price high&#13;
enough to recover their acquisition costs. Thus, it is possible that alternative sourcing of the drugs&#13;
procured under the project could decline, particularly if quantities procured under the project represent&#13;
a substantial portion of annual demand for the drugs in question. These uncertainties and risks with&#13;
respect to the project's impact on the composition of the republic's drug supply--because the magnitude&#13;
of these effects are nearly impossible to predict in advance, and because supplies of widely used drugs&#13;
could be disrupted--are reasons why the lists of drugs to be procured under the project need to be chosen&#13;
carefully and why disbursement is best spread out over multiple tranches.&#13;
52.    Distribution System. The project's most immediate impact on the drug distribution system will&#13;
be the re-capitalization of that system's weakest link: the oblast Pharmacias. Although still majority&#13;
government-owned, these companies are now nominally independent and are supposed to be operating&#13;
as commercial entities; eventually they are to be fully privatized. For now, however, the oblast&#13;
Pharmacias appear to lack both financing and drugs: their warehouses reportedly are empty; they are&#13;
deeply in debt; and they have no access to short-term credit which they might use to rebuild their&#13;
inventories. By providing these regional distributors with a substantial supply of low-cost drugs, the&#13;
project will, in effect, be giving these companies a new lease on life. If the oblast Pharmacias are&#13;
permitted to retain a significant portion of their earnings from the onward sale of these drugs, it is&#13;
possible than one or more of the five will survive and develop into a financially viable distributor with&#13;
improved prospects of escaping government control and becoming a genuinely private competitor of&#13;
Kyrgyz Pharmacia. There is, of course, no certainty in this result, although the potential gain surely&#13;
warrants the effort. For by supporting the establishment of a drug distribution system based on privately-&#13;
owned, competitive wholesalers and retailers, the project can effect a sustained improvement in the&#13;
efficiency of drug distribution in the republic and, in turn, a sustained increase in the availability of&#13;
drugs.&#13;

A. Project Implementation&#13;
1.    The overall implementation and administration of the project would be the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministry of Health. To assist in the various aspects of the project, the MOH would depend upon several&#13;
entities to provide policy advice, technical direction and specialized services. These would be carried&#13;
out, respectively, by a Project Policy Council (PPC), a Technical Coordination Committee (TCC), and&#13;
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Social Safety Net project.&#13;
B. The Role of the Project Policy Council&#13;
2.    The Project Policy Council would oversee the policies undertaken by the MOH and other entities&#13;
involved in project implementation to reform the health sector. It is chaired by the Minister of Health&#13;
or his designee, and members would include MOH Deputy Ministers, representatives from the involved&#13;
departments of the MOH, Chui and Issyk-Kul oblasts and Bishkek city medical officials, Pharmacia,&#13;
representatives from the medical community and a representative from the Ministry of Finance. It would&#13;
advise the Minister on all important policy aspects of the project and would meet once every three&#13;
months, or more often if its Chairman so decides. The Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) would&#13;
serve as the secretariat of the Project Policy Council. The TCC Director would prepare minutes of the&#13;
PC meetings and ensure that the decisions taken by the PC are implemented by the implementing&#13;
agencies/entities.&#13;
3.    The Project Policy Council has the responsibility to ensure that the objectives of the Project are&#13;
fulfilled. Among its major tasks, are:&#13;
(i)    To review the periodic project implementation reports prepared by the TCC and the&#13;
quarterly implementation schedules. Discuss any problems or issues resulting in delays&#13;
and approve necessary actions to be taken to solve problems in project implementation.&#13;
(ii)   To discuss and resolve issues linked to project implementation that cannot be resolved&#13;
by the implementing agencies/entities and the TCC and decide, in consultation with the&#13;
Bank, on all policy issues linked to project implementation.&#13;

periodically assess the status of and progress towards overall project goals. It would coordinate activities&#13;
among the components, and also coordinate the project's activities with the other donor activities in the&#13;
health sector. It would coordinate the budget planning and control of project funds, and coordinate with&#13;
the Ministry of Finance as required. Problems which are not resolved at the component level would be&#13;
raised to the TCC.  The TCC  would request and authorize the PCU  to prepare disbursement&#13;
documentation for signature by the Minister or his designee for payment of goods and services. Finally,&#13;
the TCC would maintain progress indicators, design and arrange for periodic project evaluations and&#13;
manage the periodic meetings of the PC. The MOH provides adequate office space, local telephone&#13;
service, local transportation expenses, an administrative assistant and two positions seconded to the PCU&#13;
which would be funded through MOH budgetary resources. The project would finance specialized&#13;
technical services, the TCC Director, the four TCC technical component coordinators, international&#13;

5.     By June 30, 1997 and thereafter at the end of each annual drug procurement cycle, the&#13;
Borrower's MOH will review drug procurement and distribution so as to assure that privately owned drug&#13;
wholesalers and retailers are not disadvantaged compared to remaining state-owned companies (para.&#13;
3.80).&#13;
6.     By December 31, 1997, the Borrower, through its Ministry of Health, will:&#13;
(a)    Design and implement a national health accounts system to be able to track allocation of&#13;
resources for health and the flow of funds in the health sector (para. 3.64 (c));&#13;
(b)    Establish a data base of National Case Management Guidelines for women's reproductive&#13;
health, STDs, ARI/CDD and TB, based on the WHO recommended guidelines, together&#13;

and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals solely to pharmaceuticals listed on its Essential Drug List and&#13;
registered in the country (para. 3.77);&#13;
8.    In each medical facility to be renovated under the project the Borrower, through its MOH, will&#13;
establish a stakeholder group consisting of health authorities and local government officials, before&#13;
renovation is undertaken (para. 3.36 and Annex 3).&#13;
B. Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
9.    In addition to the reporting requirements listed above the TCC will be required to monitor the&#13;
performance indicators. These indicators are broken into three types for each component: input, output&#13;
and impact. Input indicators are activities which are aimed to improve parameters which have a direct&#13;
impact on the health status, not do not themselves directly affect the health status, such as training.&#13;
Output indicators monitor the impact of input indicators and include parameters which are expected to&#13;
influence the health status directly such as number of patients being treated with new protocols. Impact&#13;
indicators monitor the degree to which project related changes in input and output parameters will result&#13;
in improvement of the health status, such as the improvement in the maternal mortality rate. Following&#13;
is a list of indicators identified for each component and targets that are to be achieved through the project.&#13;
