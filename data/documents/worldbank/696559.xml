1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMS'&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   The transport system in China has grown considerably over the last four decades.&#13;
Since 1952, the length of the highway system increased by a factor of nine and the length&#13;
of the railway network more than doubled. Despite this development, the transport&#13;
network is one of the sparsest in the world compared with the area and population it&#13;
serves. There is now a gap between transport supply and demand that is manifested by&#13;
the existence of transport bottlenecks, the administrative rationing of limited transport&#13;
capacity, the poor quality of services and losses to the economy.&#13;
B. TRAFFC&#13;
1.2   China had experienced rapid growth of traffic during 1980-89 when the economy&#13;
grew at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent. Traffic growth declined when the&#13;
economic growth slowed down during 1989-90, as the supply constraints becarne more&#13;
conspicuous. However, resumption of high economic growth since 1991 has brought&#13;
about a corresponding surge in transport demand.&#13;
1.3   Traffic Growth.  Despite the capacity constraints and related bottlenecks,&#13;
between 1980 and 1993 the ton-km of freight have grown at 7.4 percent per year and the&#13;
passenger-kilometers at 11.8 percent per year. Highway freight traffic grew at the highest&#13;
annual rate of 13.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for railway traffic and 8.1 percent&#13;
for coastal and inland waterway traffic. Despite its rapid growth, intercity passenger&#13;
travel per capita in China remains very low, at about two thirds of the level for India.&#13;
This is due primarily to the severe capacity constraints. Civil aviation traffic is rapidly&#13;
expanding and has grown 20.9 percent per year since 1980, but still represents a small&#13;
share of total traffic with most long-distance journeys made by rail (Table 1.1).&#13;
1.4   Transport Demand and Modal Split Trends. Although the railway's share of&#13;
traffic has declined over the last decade as the share of road traffic has grown, rail tranwsport&#13;
still dominates freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1993, 39.2 percent of freight and&#13;
44.3 percent of passenger traffic turnover were attributable to rail, with the remainder&#13;
moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline, and civil aviation. The&#13;
movement toward a market economy will increase demand for market-responsive twansport&#13;
services, favoring a shift to road transport but still leaving a growing market for the&#13;
relatively low-cost rail transport system.&#13;
This chapter is an abstract of the Bank sector report (No. 11819-CHA) China Highway Development&#13;
and Management Issues, Options and Strategies, February 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.5  In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase economic&#13;
efficiency through measures designed to reduce national government intervention in the&#13;
production and distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies to&#13;
state-owned enterprises, and open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further&#13;
participation of private and collective enterprises. In the transport sector, several reforms&#13;
have been undertaken in line with these objectives-many with Bank assistance.&#13;
1.6   These initiatives are helping to spur the growth and modernization of the transport&#13;
system. However, much more needs to be done to bring about the changes required to&#13;
deal effectively with the emerging issues. To alleviate the transport bottlenecks and&#13;
rationalize the transport system, the Government will need to take the following measures&#13;
by the year 2000:&#13;
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand&#13;
capacity to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs&#13;
caused by past underinvestment;&#13;
'b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of&#13;
railways, highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of&#13;
transport;&#13;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major&#13;
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;&#13;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through&#13;
technological modernization and management reforms; and&#13;
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and&#13;
within modes, with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.&#13;
D. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
The National Highway Network and its Utilization&#13;
1.7   China's road network consists mainly of aging roads with neither the capacity nor&#13;
strength to carry current and projected future traffic. Many of the roads need upgrading&#13;
in addition to normal maintenance and rehabilitation. A Bank policy study on road&#13;
deterioration in developing countries classified China among the countries with an&#13;
extensive and obsolete road network in need of modernization to meet the rapid growth in&#13;
road transport demand.  Although China has not neglected road maintenance, its&#13;
outmoded maintenance technology would not be sufficient to arrest the accelerated&#13;
deterioration of the aging road system network. China needs to mobilize domestic and&#13;
external resources for modernizing its road system with special emphasis placed on&#13;
technology transfer, institutional improvement, and development of skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
1.8   The rapid growth of highway traffic stems not only from the country's rapid&#13;
economic growth but also from other factors such as the national policy of shifting short-&#13;
haul transport from rail to road as well as the expansion of the service sector and rural&#13;
industries. Furthermore, with the increase in foreign trade, growth in transport demand&#13;
will be concentrated in transport corridors serving the main ports and their hinterlands&#13;
and, with containerization of higher-value commodities, most domestic movements of&#13;
this foreign trade are expected to go by road.&#13;
1.9    Growth in the truck and bus fleet has been fairly steady at an average annual rate of&#13;
12.3 percent over the last 12 years, with particularly strong growth in small passenger&#13;
vehicles.  Growth in the tractor and motorcycle fleets has increased sharply, with&#13;
motorcycles showing the strongest growth of all vehicle types. The composition of vehicles&#13;
using China's roads is diverse, including a variety of motorized and a large number of other&#13;
(nonmotor) vehicles. The tractor and motorcycle fleets, for example, at 5.4 million and 6.5&#13;
million respectively, well exceed the size of the truck and bus fleet.  Tractors and&#13;
motorcycles offer a relatively cheap and basic form of transport, but contribute significantly&#13;
to traffic congestion and are among the major causes of road accidents.&#13;
1.10  The trucking industry consists of publicly-owned trucks operated by trucking&#13;
companies affiliated with local (provincial or district) highway authorities, and other trucks&#13;
operated by factories, cooperative organizations and, recently, private individuals. The&#13;
relaxation of trucking regulations in the early 1980s allowed own-account trucks to haul&#13;
cargo for other factories and cooperatives and thus promoted competition between public&#13;
and own-account trucks. While market forces are expected to play a more important role in&#13;
shaping the industry in the future, it is necessary to understand the current constraints to&#13;
such development and to identify the measures needed to allow the reshaping of the&#13;
industry to take place. In order to explore these issues more fully, a Provincial Trucking&#13;
Study was included as a component of the Bank-assisted Henan Provincial Highway Project&#13;
and was completed in 1994, and a separate study of the trucking industry was completed by&#13;
the Bank in 1995.&#13;
1.11   Road safety is an important issue in the development of China's road sector, as&#13;
traffic continues to grow rapidly on all roads and a high-speed, national highway network&#13;
is developed. The frequency and numbers of people involved in traffic accidents have&#13;
reached serious proportions in China. The annual fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in&#13;
China is 46, as compared with rates of 33 in India, 12 in Indonesia, 5 in Mexico, 9 in&#13;
Thailand, 18 in Hungary, and 2 in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom&#13;
(Table 1.2). However, the annual fatality rate per 100,000 population in China is the&#13;
same or less than that for developed countries. This reflects the low motorization rates&#13;
(vehicles per 1,000 population) in China.. The social and economic costs of these&#13;
accidents to the Chinese economy reached almost $1 billion annually.2&#13;
2 The costs analyzed in this case included loss of life, injury, property damage, reduced productivity, and&#13;
medical, funeral, and legal costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.12 Responsibility for highway safety matters was transferred from MOC and the&#13;
provincial Communications Departments to the Ministry of Public Security and its&#13;
provincial units in 1988. This decision created transitional administrative problems.&#13;
Cooperation between the provincial highway administration bureaus and the concerned&#13;
public security units is still weak. Under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway&#13;
Project (Loan 3929), a road safety manual and a safety audit system will be developed. The&#13;
Bank-financed Xinjiang Highway Project (Loan 3787) and the Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 3530) contain pilot programs that address the traffic accident black&#13;
spot problem. The Second Conference on Asian Road Safety is scheduled to be held in&#13;
Beijing October 28-31, 1996. The Bank is discussing with GOC the possibility of holding a&#13;
National Road Safety Seminar in 1997, to be followed by a similar Provincial Road&#13;
Seminar in 1998.&#13;
Highway Administration, Planning and Finance&#13;
1.13 Administration of the highway network is the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
govermnents, through the Highways Bureaus of the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments. The central government's MOC provides general policy guidance and&#13;
support to the provinces through its nationwide policies and regulations, specifying&#13;
design and construction standards.   However, the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments are financially independent of MOC and carry out all road planning,&#13;
construction, maintenance, and operation of roads and waterways in the provinces.&#13;
1.14  While the provinces manage the country's highway network, MOC is responsible&#13;
for planning and investment strategies for the development of the National Highway&#13;
System. MOC has been evolving a long-term strategy for the systematic upgrading of the&#13;
national system in key corridors over a 30-year planning horizon. Known as the National&#13;
Trunk Highway System (NTHS), the system, comprising 12 major roads for the exclusive&#13;
use of motor vehicles (Map IBRD 27488) would connect all the provincial capitals and&#13;
cities with populations exceeding 500,000. Development of the NTHS has been accorded&#13;
highest priority in investment planning for the highway sector. Priority for early&#13;
construction is being given to two north-south corridors (Beijing-Zhuhai and Tonjiang-&#13;
Harbin-Shenyang-Qingdao-Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou-Sanya); two east-west corridors&#13;
(Lianyungang-Zhengzhou-Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Huoergousi and Shanghai-Nanjing-&#13;
Jiujiang-Wuhan-Chengdu) and the three corridors of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Shenyang&#13;
and Chongqing-Beihai, and to those routes already identified as congested and hindering&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
1.15 A system for finding highway construction and maintenance is well established,&#13;
although there are differences between provinces according to local needs and&#13;
circumstances. The main revenues are generated by the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF),&#13;
typically levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and on the&#13;
capacity of own-account vehicles. The RMF is levied by the provinces who retain the&#13;
majority of the monies after remitting a portion to Central Government agencies. MOC&#13;
also directly receives revenues from the Added Vehicle Purchase Fee, a supplementary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
earnarked tax on vehicle imports and sales, and uses these funds, which currently reach&#13;
about Y 2 billion/year, to contribute financing for: (a) the roads included in the national&#13;
highway network, providing a higher share of financing for the poorer, inland provinces and&#13;
a lower share for the richer, coastal provinces, and (b) construction or rehabilitation of rural&#13;
roads located in economically less-developed areas.&#13;
E. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.16 The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Govermment in the transport&#13;
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.8 billion for 34 projects (Table 1.3). The&#13;
dialogue between the Government and the Bank Group on transport sector operations and&#13;
strategy has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways&#13;
and ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed&#13;
studies as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The&#13;
various studies have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of multimodal transport investrnent&#13;
and the setting of sectoral priorities based on systemwide economic evaluation&#13;
techniques.3&#13;
Transport Sector Work&#13;
1.17   Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Railway&#13;
Strategy (No. 10592-CHA, February 1993), Highway Development and Management:&#13;
Issues, Options and Strategies (No. 11819-CHA, February 1994), and Strategies for Road&#13;
Freight Development (No. 12600-CHA, January 1995). In addition, studies on the&#13;
trucking industry and highway financing have been completed under ongoing projects, a&#13;
study of the provincial road construction industry is being undertaken under the Fujian&#13;
Provincial Highway Project, a study of interprovincial traffic facilitation and a highway&#13;
capacity study are being undertaken under the National Highway Project (Hebei/Henan),&#13;
a study of intercity passenger transport is being carried out under the Xinjiang Highway&#13;
Project, and a study of highway maintenance is being included in the Second Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Project. In addition, a study for improved prioritization of highway&#13;
investments and improved highway feasibility study methodology was completed in&#13;
March 1996. A program for institutional strengthening of MOC is being prepared and will&#13;
be supported under a technical assistance credit (China Reforn, Institutional Support and&#13;
Preinvestment Project-CRISPP, Credit 2447-CHA). The Bank Group also conducted a&#13;
survey of the national water transport system in the mid-1980s, which has reaffirmed the&#13;
need to further exploit the large potential of the Chinese waterways.&#13;
3 Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive&#13;
and more economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's&#13;
decisionmakers: the Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze&#13;
Economic Zone Transport Study (YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment&#13;
Study (RIS); the Southeast Coastal Region Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study&#13;
(SIPS); and the Price Reform Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
1.18  On the basis of its project and sector work, the Bank has an opportunity to deepen&#13;
its involvement and assist the Government in the design and implementation of institutional&#13;
and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation, investment planning, pricing,&#13;
financing, deregulation of transport services, operational efficiency, and transfer of&#13;
advanced transport-related technology through training and provision of up-to-date&#13;
equipment.  Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a&#13;
comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide sector&#13;
development in a consistent, cohesive policy framnework.&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy in Highways&#13;
1.19  Of the 15 Bank-assisted highway projects in China, two have so far been&#13;
completed (the First Highway Project and the Shaanxi Highway Project). The former&#13;
project achieved its original objectives and demonstrated the benefits of improved&#13;
accessibility to economically less-developed regions. Economic activity in the area of&#13;
influence of most project roads surged and income levels increased noticeably.&#13;
Furthermore, the Bank's involvement facilitated the acceptance of competition in the&#13;
contracting for road works in preference to force account operations even for smaller civil&#13;
works contracts, as well as the merits of supervision of construction by specially assigned&#13;
units.&#13;
1.20 The Bank strategy for highway lending in the medium term is detailed in Highway&#13;
Development and Management. Issues, Options and Strategies. The strategy is to continue&#13;
supporting institutional development and sectoral reforms aimed at modernizing the&#13;
highway system and its management, and supporting investments focused on high-priority&#13;
links of the NTHS and the provincial road networks that feed into it.&#13;
1.21  While some institutional development and sectoral reform  components will&#13;
normally be included in every project, specific issues identified during the Bank's dialogue&#13;
with the government, will be addressed selectively in individual provincial projects. During&#13;
the next few years, the projects' investment components will continue to focus on high-&#13;
priority links of the national highway system, to support the development of the provincial&#13;
road networks, and to provide all-weather access to the poor areas to help alleviate poverty.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM PREvious BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.22  Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early&#13;
preparation for major civil and traffic engineering works and for procurement processes,&#13;
where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of bidding&#13;
documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth&#13;
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.&#13;
The design of traffic engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications,&#13;
tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be finished shortly after&#13;
completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
1.23  Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people have also led to&#13;
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects. A large&#13;
number of people are typically affected by resettlement in China, particularly along&#13;
important economic corridors where highways are being upgraded and constructed. The&#13;
institutional requirements for resettlement of these numbers of people are significant;&#13;
under the proposed project, resettlement has received considerable attention to ensure&#13;
institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans.&#13;
1.24  Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.&#13;
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during&#13;
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during&#13;
both the construction and operation phases.&#13;
1.25  Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of&#13;
roads. Poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle operating cost&#13;
savings, and may reduce reliability and/or accessibility of the road. Higher costs also&#13;
result from premature deterioration, where corrective actions in the form of increased&#13;
maintenance and/or rehabilitation are required.  Construction quality has also been&#13;
highlighted as a sector issue for Bank highway projects. Effective remedial actions&#13;
include careful formulation of supervision arrangements, including engagement of&#13;
foreign experts, training of local supervision staff and equipping the supervision teams&#13;
with the necessary laboratory equipment, surveying instruments, transportation and&#13;
telecommunications facilities.&#13;
1.26  There is a growing concern that adequate funding for highway maintenance is not&#13;
now being generated to cover an expanding and more expensive highway system.&#13;
Previously, this was not an issue-adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose.&#13;
1.27 Experience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia and with the Bank's&#13;
Shaanxi Highway Project in China has shown that provision of basic access through all-&#13;
weather roads and provision of nonmotorized transport are effective means of reducing&#13;
poverty in rural areas, especially when combined with programs for socioeconomic&#13;
development.&#13;
1.28  Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway&#13;
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank&#13;
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Institutional components&#13;
that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact, as&#13;
compared with free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.&#13;
Systematic supervision and follow-up of the findings of studies and technical assistance&#13;
components by Bank missions also enhance project outcomes. Ultimately, the success of&#13;
the road safety component of the project depends upon the Borrower's commitment to the&#13;
objectives of the component and its ability to ensure effective coordination between the&#13;
Traffic Police and the Highway Department-the main two agencies involved in the&#13;
implementation of this component.&#13;

2. HENAN PROVINCIAL TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1   Henan, with about 90 million people, is the country's second most populous&#13;
province. Landlocked in China's central plain, the Yellow River divides the province in&#13;
two, the larger part to the south. The total area is about 167,000 kM2, representing&#13;
1.7 percent of the country; of which about 56 percent is flat areas and 44 percent is rolling&#13;
and mountainous areas. In addition to the Yellow River, the province has three other main&#13;
river basins: the Weihe, Hanshui and Hauihe Rivers. Availability of water, a good amount&#13;
of annual rainfall (785 mm), and a moderate climate, make agriculture the province's main&#13;
economic sector. Wheat, com, tobacco, and animal husbandry are the main agricultural&#13;
outputs. The Bank is assisting the development of agriculture through a project that aims to&#13;
increase crop, livestock and fish production and productivity in Northem and Eastem Henan&#13;
(Credit 2242-CHA) and is preparing a multipurpose dam project at Xiaolangdi that will&#13;
further enhance the province's agricultural production. The Yanshi Thermal Power Project&#13;
(Loan 3433-CHA) will help alleviate acute power shortages in all sectors, including&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
2.2   The province also has a well-developed industrial base, with machinery, textiles and&#13;
foodstuffs having the highest output values. In 1994, the gross output value of agriculture&#13;
and industry (GOVAI) reached about $27 billion. Since the start in 1986 of the 7th FYP,&#13;
the provincial economy has been growing at an average annual rate of 9.7 percent, despite&#13;
the recession in 1989/90. Between 1991 and 1994, the annual growth rate was even higher&#13;
(12.5 percent). This is an impressive economic performance, particularly since Henan, as&#13;
other inland provinces, has not benefited from the "special economic zone" incentives that&#13;
have propelled growth in several coastal provinces. Despite Henan's high economic&#13;
growth, its income per capita is still about 36 percent below China's average, and the&#13;
province has important pockets of poverty areas. In 1993, the Government had classified&#13;
34 counties as poor. Nearly 10 percent of China's poor in 1993, 7.6 million, lived in&#13;
Henan. Lack of transport infrastructure is one of the key factors behind the depressed&#13;
economic conditions in these areas.&#13;
B. THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM&#13;
2.3   Henan's strategic location as a crossroads of major north-south (N-S) and east-west&#13;
(E-W) rail and road corridors attracts large amounts of transit traffic to use such facilities,&#13;
particularly the railways. The predominant transit cargo is coal, which originates in the&#13;
neighboring provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi.  Transport demands have increased&#13;
substantially over the last five years, due to fast economic growth of the province and of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
rest of the country, whose output traverses Henan to and from ports and major population&#13;
centers.&#13;
2.4   Zhengzhou, the province's capital, is at the center of the key land transport facilities.&#13;
These are the N-S Beijing-Guangzhou railway and national road 107, and the E-W&#13;
Lanzhou-Lianyungang railway and national road 310. A number of other major railways,&#13;
as well as local railways and roads, cross the province (Map IBRD 27489). In 1994, the&#13;
total length of the state-run rail network in the province was 2,086 km, and that of the local&#13;
rail network was 1,264 km. Due to its important transit function, Henan's transport system&#13;
density is larger than China's average. However, as in the case of the country as a whole,&#13;
the provincial land transport system is small in relation to the province's area and&#13;
population, many important rail lines operate at capacity and the key roads have low&#13;
standards, carry significant amounts of slow-moving traffic, and are congested. River&#13;
navigation is not a major transport mode because the Yellow River is affected by serious&#13;
sand deposits in its riverbed. Other rivers also provide limited services. The total length of&#13;
navigable rivers is about 1,104 km, but most sections allow small boats or ferries only, even&#13;
under the best seasonal conditions.&#13;
2.5    With its high proportion of hilly and mountainous areas, and the several water&#13;
streams, topography and hydrography pose difficult barriers to the development of land&#13;
transport infrastructure. The provincial government has made a special effort to integrate&#13;
the province's areas across the Yellow River; over the last 20 years, it has built four&#13;
highway bridges at Sanmenxia, Luoyang, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.&#13;
2.6   Henan's highway system  extends about 47,704 km, of which about 81 km&#13;
(0.2 percent) are expressways, 78 km (0.1 percent) are Class 1, 192 km (0.4 percent) are&#13;
Class II auto only, 4,866 km (10.2 percent) are ordinary Class II, 39,265 km (82.3 percent)&#13;
are Class III and IV, and the remainder (3,222 km or 6.8 percent) are unclassified (Table&#13;
2.1). The administrative classification of the road system in 1994 was as follows:&#13;
km                         %&#13;
National                             3,526                       7.4&#13;
Provincial                           7,948                       16.7&#13;
County                              11,740                      23.6&#13;
Village/Township                    23,860                      50.0&#13;
Other                                1,130                       2.3&#13;
Total                            47,704                      100.0&#13;
2.7    As in the rest of the country, most of Henan's highways were built in the 1960s,&#13;
and their design standards were suitable for the light vehicles and low traffic levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
prevailing in China at the time. About 59 percent of the roads have cement or asphalt&#13;
pavement, but the pavements are of low bearing capacity for the vehicles that circulate on&#13;
them. Due to the substantial growth in traffic levels and steady rise in the use of heavy&#13;
vehicles, these roads increasingly are becoming inadequate to meet the needs. The&#13;
provincial government is giving high priority to repairing and strengthening these roads.&#13;
2.8   In addition to inadequate standards, Henan's road network is small and significant&#13;
segments of the population cannot reach it. About 8 percent of the administrative villages&#13;
have no access to roads of any kind, and 7 percent of the counties do not have all-weather&#13;
roads available to them. During the 7th FYP. the provincial governnent invested Y 40&#13;
million in poverty areas for 362 rural road projects. During the 8th FYP, the province&#13;
allocated Y 420 million for poverty alleviation.&#13;
2.9    Henan's vehicle fleet has expanded rapidly (11.7 percent for passenger cars and&#13;
vans, buses, and trucks) during 1985-94 (Table 2.2). During this period, passenger&#13;
vehicles (small cars, vans and buses) grew by 18.1 percent per year and trucks by&#13;
4.0 percent per year, rellecting the growing prosperity in Henan and the light-vehicle&#13;
needs of the growing number of enterprises in the economy. Tractors and motorcycles&#13;
registered extremely high growth rates (29.2 and 22.2 percent, respectively) during 1990-&#13;
94. While tractors are mainly used for agricultural purposes, often they travel on the&#13;
roads, posing significant safety hazard and, due to their low speeds, severely reducing&#13;
road capacity. This rapid growth poses particular problems to transport planners, in and&#13;
around the larger cities, especially Zhengzhou and Luoyang.&#13;
C. TRAFFIC&#13;
2.10   Over the last decade, traffic has been rising strongly in all modes, with annual&#13;
average growth rates for land transport of 7.1 percent for freight and 9.3 percent for&#13;
passengers. However, highways and railways are the principal modes. Growth rates on&#13;
highways are significantly higher than on railways. Highway passenger traffic rose at&#13;
19.6 percent annually and freight traffic at 14.1 percent annually during the period&#13;
1991-94, and is taking an increasing share of total traffic (Table 2.3).&#13;
2.11   The increase in road freight and passenger transport is reflected in the traffic growth&#13;
on individual roads. On main trunk roads, such as Luoyang-Sanmenxia, the annual rate of&#13;
traffic growth over the 1991-94 period has ranged between 14 percent and 23 percent,&#13;
depending on the section.&#13;
2.12   Highway traffic includes a high proportion of slow-moving vehicles, mainly tractors&#13;
of various sizes. Traffic includes also substantial bicycles and other nonmotorized vehicles.&#13;
In 1994, slow traffic accounted for some 10 to 15 percent of all traffic on the Luoyang-&#13;
Sanmenxia route. While on the main roads, slow-moving traffic is growing at lower rates&#13;
than overall traffic, it still is a major factor in road congestion and traffic accidents. To&#13;
tackle this problem, Henan has started development of access-controlled highways where&#13;
traffic volumes are sufficiently high to justify them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.13 The high growth of road traffic and its increasing share of total transport stem from&#13;
the development of the road system, and from increasing volumes of industrial output for&#13;
which roads are a convenient mode of transport. The steep growth in road traffic shows the&#13;
strong demand for highway service, since the surge in traffic took place despite severe&#13;
constraints posed by inadequate road standards, small coverage of the system, high&#13;
congestion, and poorly developed trucking services. Over the next 5 to 10 years, highway&#13;
traffic is likely to continue to grow at a high pace, in response to the growth of the national&#13;
and provincial economies, to changes in economic structure favoring faster door-to-door&#13;
road services, and to improvements in the national highways in Henan as in the neighboring&#13;
provinces. Such road improvements will allow more long-distance, interprovincial trade&#13;
and people to travel by road.&#13;
2.14   The surge in highway traffic is also due to the differentials in road-rail tariffs (in&#13;
favor of rail) and the Railways decision not to accept short-distance freight hauls of less&#13;
than 200 km. However, the transport price differential diminishes when transshipment&#13;
costs and travel times are considered. For passengers, the tariffs are much closer between&#13;
the two modes (Y 0.055/pass-km on road transport, compared to Y 0.038 for railways, for&#13;
distances of about 100 km). The tariff differential should gradually decrease as the railways&#13;
continues to adjust its tariffs upwards, and as improvements to the roads and in the&#13;
efficiency of the trucking industry reduce the costs of road transport.&#13;
D. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY&#13;
2.15   As elsewhere in China, public trucking operations in Henan are characterized by&#13;
low load factors, high operating costs and rates, and poor quality of services. Such&#13;
services are provided by three categories of transport companies: state-owned, collective&#13;
and private. Due to the weaknesses of public trucking, most large industrial and&#13;
commercial companies have bought their own vehicles, making own-account trucking the&#13;
major road freight carrier. Such companies are estimated to own about 60 percent of the&#13;
road freight fleet and to do about 40 percent of the ton-km. While own-account trucking&#13;
is even less efficient than public carrier services, most enterprises have found this&#13;
approach convenient, and the proportion of own-account trucking has been increasing in&#13;
the last years (Table 2.4).&#13;
2.16   As noted in para. 2.14, road freight tariffs are higher than the railway's. The&#13;
differential is large, even taking into account that in China (a) road costs are high due to&#13;
poor road condition, (b) railway operating costs are low due to high traffic densities and&#13;
efficient operations and (c) many railway tariffs are below cost. Despite the high tariffs for&#13;
road transport, most of the large trucking companies owned by the cities or prefectures lose&#13;
money. Collective and private trucking companies appear to do well financially, in part due&#13;
to better utilization of their equipment and in part due to fewer social obligations than the&#13;
governnent companies. Government-operated freight information offices throughout the&#13;
province provide, for a fee, freight information/brokerage services to shippers and truckers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.17  Henan authorities are concerned about the low efficiency and poor quality of&#13;
trucking services and the proliferation of own-account trucking. Recently, restrictions have&#13;
been placed for enterprises to purchase and operate their own vehicles, and other measures&#13;
have been taken to improve control of trucking operations. While such measures are&#13;
expected to generate some improvements, they are not likely to induce the gains in&#13;
efficiency and quality of services that are required. Under the Henan Provincial Highway&#13;
Project (Loan 353 1-CHA), a detailed study of trucking in the province (completed in 1994)&#13;
made a diagnosis of the present situation and recommendations for improvements. Some of&#13;
these recommendations are already being implemented.&#13;
2.18  The ongoing liberalization of the trucking regulations may not be sufficient to&#13;
address all the existing problems encountered in the trucking market, but some measures&#13;
have been taken to restructure the market and to promote free flow of traffic and trade&#13;
between provinces. For example, participation of private operators is permitted and&#13;
encouraged, the protection of state-owned and collectively-owned trucking or bus&#13;
companies has been abolished, and one transport permit to move around the country has&#13;
been introduced. The Bank-financed National Highway Project (Loan 3748-CHA)&#13;
includes a traffic facilitation study, which aims to identify the bottlenecks to be removed&#13;
and to recommend measures to ensure freer movements of traffic and trade between&#13;
provinces. This study is presently being undertaken and is expected to be completed in&#13;
the first quarter of 1996.&#13;
E. HIGHWAY SAFETY&#13;
2.19  Road safety is a serious problem in Henan, as elsewhere in China. In 1994 alone,&#13;
3,648 people were killed and 10,162 were injured in the 14,147 accidents reported to the&#13;
police in that year (Table 2.5). International comparisons of the number killed in traffic&#13;
accidents per 10,000 vehicles show that the rate in Henan is about 40 times higher than&#13;
that for Western Europe and North America. However, the accident rates, when&#13;
expressed in fatalities per 100,000 population, are lower than those in the developed&#13;
countries. It should be recognized that China and Henan are in the early stages of&#13;
motorization (when traditionally traffic fatalities and injuries are high), traffic is mixed&#13;
(with a high proportion of slow-moving vehicles, bicycles, animal-drawn carts) and&#13;
increasing at a fast pace, and the number of pedestrians is high.&#13;
2.20  While there is increasing concern about road safety, the Henan Provincial&#13;
Communications Department (HPCD) has had less scope for action following the&#13;
reorganization of responsibility for road safety matters in China in 1988.  Most&#13;
responsibility for matters affecting road safety, including that for vehicle testing and&#13;
inspection, driver training and licensing, propaganda on safety, enforcement of traffic&#13;
laws (including imposition of fines), operation of traffic signals, highway patrols, and all&#13;
aspects of accident, reporting, investigation and research, now lies with the Traffic Police&#13;
of the Public Security Bureau (PSB). However, HPCD retains responsibility for all&#13;
matters concerning safe highway design and traffic signs and markings. HPCD and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Traffic Police worked together under the project to develop a modest program to address&#13;
the road safety problem in Henan (para. 3.37).&#13;
F. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION&#13;
2.21  HPCD  controls highway and inland river navigation and local railways&#13;
undertakings in the province, as well as the Zhongyuan Civil Aviation Company (Chart&#13;
1). HPCD reports directly to the provincial government and acts as its administrative arm&#13;
for planning, budgeting and financing of transport in the province. However, HPCD&#13;
conforns to the general transport policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC. Key&#13;
agencies under its administration for the management of Henan's highway system are the&#13;
World Bank-Financed Projects Office (WBFPO); Henan Provincial Planning, Survey and&#13;
Design Institute (HPPSDI); Henan Provincial Highway Scientific Research Institute&#13;
(HPHSRI); Henan Provincial Transport College (HPTC); Henan Provincial Transport&#13;
Vocational School (HPTVS); Henan Provincial Highway Administration Bureau&#13;
(HPHAB); and Henan Provincial High-Grade Highway Construction Authority&#13;
(HPHGHCA). Their respective duties are to raise funds internationally; to plan, survey&#13;
and design roads; conduct highway research; train and replenish technical and&#13;
management personnel; and construct and manage high-grade highways. Based on the&#13;
similar arrangements made under the previous two ongoing highway projects financed by&#13;
the Bank in the province, the proposed project will also help strengthen six of the above&#13;
institutions (paras. 3.31-3.34).&#13;
2.22  HPHAB  is responsible  for construction, renovation, maintenance  and&#13;
management of the provincial highway network. It receives professional and technical&#13;
guidance from MOC. With a headquarters staff of about 101, HPHAB executes its&#13;
responsibilities through the local administrations set up in the various municipalities and&#13;
prefectures (total number, 17) and counties (193 county-level and district) and 1,353&#13;
maintenance gangs of the province (Chart 2). The 17 highway prefectures are in charge&#13;
of local construction, maintenance and management of the national and provincial&#13;
highway network in their jurisdiction. Each of the counties has responsibility under the&#13;
prefecture to construct and maintain the county and rural roads under its jurisdiction. The&#13;
total staff of HPHAB and the highway departments of the cities, prefectures and counties&#13;
amounted to 45,278 in 1994, of which about 3,613 are engineering and technical&#13;
personnel and about 1,077 are finance, economics, and management personnel. The three&#13;
construction divisions of the Highway Engineering Bureau are responsible for&#13;
construction of large- and medium-size highway projects. HPHGHCA is in charge of&#13;
construction and management of high-grade highways, such as expressways.&#13;
2.23  HPHGHCA is a department-level institution that reports directly to HPCD.&#13;
Established in 1990, HPHGHCA's first task, currently underway, is the construction and&#13;
management of the Kaifeng-Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway and the Anyang-Xinxiang&#13;
Expressway.  Also, HPHGHCA would be responsible for the construction and&#13;
management of the proposed Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway. As the network of high-&#13;
grade highu-ays is expanded and put into operation, HPHGHCA is expected to develop&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
into the High-Grade Highway Administration, responsible for the maintenance and&#13;
operation, in addition to the development of that network. The organizational structure of&#13;
HPHGHCA is shown in Chart 3. The executive officer of HPHGHCA is the deputy&#13;
director of HPCD, and he is assisted by seven division chiefs representing all agencies&#13;
that have a bearing on the work of HPHGHCA. The approved number of staff for&#13;
HPHGHCA is 50, including 32 professional and technical personnel.  At present,&#13;
HPHGHCA's source of finance is the income it derives from managing high-grade&#13;
highway projects.&#13;
2.24  HPCD has established a special office-the World Bank-Financed Projects&#13;
Office-to be in charge of preparation work, coordination and supervision of all the&#13;
aspects related to the highway projects financed by the Bank in the province (Chart 4),&#13;
including the proposed LSE.&#13;
G. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND FINANCING&#13;
2.25  Planning.   HPCD  has overall responsibility for planning, funding and&#13;
maintaining the provincial highway network. However, the highway administration units&#13;
at the prefecture, county and village levels have considerable autonomy in planning&#13;
smaller road investments. These smaller investments are subject to the approval of&#13;
HPCD, largely as a formality. Each administrative group prepares investment plans for&#13;
the highway network under its jurisdiction and submits them to the planning division of&#13;
HPCD by September of each year for the next year's plan starting January 1. HPCD&#13;
approves the next year's plan for each county or local authority concerned. Similarly,&#13;
using inputs from lower administrative groups, HPCD prepares the five-year road&#13;
development plan reflecting national or provincial development policy guidelines and&#13;
objectives for the plan period.&#13;
2.26  Budgeting. As is done in all provincial communications departments in China,&#13;
HPCD follows a balanced budget policy. The proposed highway investment is always&#13;
balanced against the revenue earmarked for highway development, the funds for&#13;
investments and maintenance approved for each year are closely related to the amount of&#13;
funds expected to be available to HPCD for the same year. In October of each year and&#13;
before HPCD approves the following year's projects, the current year's planned&#13;
investments are reviewed against actual investments and revenue receipts and&#13;
adjustments are made where needed.&#13;
2.27  Financing. Funding for highway construction and maintenance comes from&#13;
several sources, but by far the largest source is the road maintenance fee (RMF).&#13;
Revenue from RMF increased from about Y 754 million in 1991 to about Y 1.36 billion&#13;
in 1995. Highway revenues and expenditures are summarized in Table 2.6. The RMF is&#13;
determined and collected by HPCD from all motor vehicles in the province. The&#13;
province retains about 81.6 percent for its own use. Since 1992, the balance of the&#13;
revenues from RMF has been generally allocated as follows: 10.4 percent to MOC's&#13;
Energy and Communications Fund, 5.4 percent to the SPC-controlled Budget Adjustment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Fund, and about 2 percent (or an agreed amount) to the Public Security Bureau for their&#13;
highway patrol and administrative operations.&#13;
2.28  The fee rates vaiy depending on the type and size of vehicles, as follows:&#13;
(a) vehicles owned by state transport companies and by collective carriers are charged&#13;
15 percent of their gross revenues; (b) vehicles owned by collective and private operators&#13;
are charged Y 160 per month per payload ton for trucks and Y 160 per month per&#13;
10-passenger seat buses; and (c) passenger cars are charged Y 85 per month.&#13;
2.29  Other sources of revenue for highways include: (a) allocations from MOC for&#13;
construction and reconstruction of national and major provincial roads on a selective&#13;
basis; (b) local funds raised from tolls; and (c) loans from banks, including the World&#13;
Bank. Revenues from the MOC allocations rose from Y 84 million in 1991 to Y 750&#13;
million in 1995, or a 73 percent annual increase. Toll revenue rose steadily in the&#13;
province, from Y 42 million in 1991 to Y 970 million in 1995 (Table 2.6).&#13;
2.30  Currently, fuel taxes are charged on road users, but they are kept by MOF and are&#13;
not allocated back to road works. Fuel taxes at present amount to 43 percent of the base&#13;
price of gasoline and 13 percent of the base price of diesel fuels. Total fuel prices,&#13;
including taxes, are higher than international market prices and are increasing at a rate&#13;
higher than the consumer price index (Table 2.7).&#13;
H. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
2.31  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are designed by the planning and design&#13;
institutes at the provincial, prefectural and county levels. The Henan Provincial Highway&#13;
Survey and Design Institute (HPHSDI) is one of the Class I-level design and survey units&#13;
for highway, bridge and engineering supervision accredited by MOC. It is qualified for&#13;
Class I roads and expressways and is responsible for all major road, bridge and tunnel&#13;
projects. HPHSDI is competent and has qualified and experienced personnel, as well as&#13;
equipment. It has carried out the design and bid documents for LSE, as well as those for&#13;
the Zhengzhou-Luoyang Expressway-ZLE (Loan 3531-CHA) and the Anyang-&#13;
Xinxiang Expressway-AXE (Loan 3748-CHA). The design institutes at the municipal&#13;
and county levels are responsible for lower-grade county and township road design&#13;
works, including the linking roads to LSE and the roads in the Road Improvements for&#13;
Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) included under the proposed project. These design institutes&#13;
are, in general, competent and have experienced personnel for carrying out their&#13;
respective highway design tasks.&#13;
2.32  Construction.  Small-scale roads and bridges in the province used to be&#13;
constructed by the construction units of the highway departments of each city or county,&#13;
but competition has been introduced under the strong and effective promotion of the&#13;
Bank. Such competition is gradually being accepted by the localities. The Highways&#13;
Administration Bureau of HPCD is responsible for the construction of large- and&#13;
medium-size highways and bridges. HPHGHCA and WBFPO are responsible for the&#13;
launching, implementation and management of high-standard roads in the province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
Since SPC has directed that all major civil works have to be awarded through competitive&#13;
bidding, many of the large construction units or engineering bureaus under MOC, MOF&#13;
or under HPCD were transformed into financial independent contracting firms or&#13;
companies and have entered into contracts either individually or as partners in joint&#13;
ventures on previous Bank-financed highway projects. These construction units can take&#13;
part in bidding within and outside the province. Contractors for the civil works of ZLE&#13;
and AXE were selected through prequalification and international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB), and contractors for the proposed LSE will also be selected through the same&#13;
process.&#13;
2.33  Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by highway bureaus of the&#13;
counties and cities. Maintenance is well organized and executed. HPCD estimates that in&#13;
1995, about 92 percent of the national and provincial roads were in good condition. The&#13;
corresponding figure for county and village roads was 80 percent. The main problem has&#13;
been the poor riding quality of road surfaces stemming from labor-intensive and low-&#13;
technology methods. Many of the pavements have exceeded their design life and need&#13;
major overhaul. Also, overloading of trucks and tractors is becoming a problem, which&#13;
accelerates deterioration of the pavement.&#13;
2.34  Expenditures for periodic and routine maintenance increased and between 1991&#13;
and 1994 averaged about Y 10,000 to Y 15,000 per km for Class I roads, Y 8,000 to&#13;
Y 10,000 per km for Class II roads, Y 3,000 to Y 5,000 per km for Class III roads, and&#13;
about Y 3,000 per km for Class IV roads. The expenditures for maintenance (routine and&#13;
periodic) as a percentage of total expenditures amounted to about 14 percent over the&#13;
same period.  However, the investments in rehabilitation, reconstruction and new&#13;
construction increased from 63.3 percent to 80.6 percent. During this period, traffic has&#13;
increased rapidly and the number and size of trucks has also increased.&#13;
2.35  While increased expenditures for road maintenance and new construction have&#13;
offset some of the immediate need for heavy maintenance, HPCD is aware that&#13;
continuation of this practice would lead to deterioration of the existing network. HPCD&#13;
intends to increase the percentage of roads in good and excellent condition. To this effect,&#13;
assurances were obtained at negotiations from HPCD that it would, by April 30 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1997 and ending in 2003, furnish an annual highway maintenance&#13;
report for the Bank's review and comments, which would: (a) indicate the length of each&#13;
class of road by condition (excellent, good, fair and bad); (b) establish targets for the&#13;
following year, including an estimate of the required physical works (routine&#13;
maintenance, periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading) and the costs thereof;&#13;
and (c) measure the results and the actual expenditures against the targets and the&#13;
budgetedfunds thereof Under the proposed project, the planning and execution of these&#13;
physical works would be monitored to ensure that the targets are realized and that the&#13;
required funds are being allocated. Also, in addition to the maintenance equipment and&#13;
training provided under the two Bank-financed highway projects in Henan Province, the&#13;
proposed project provides additional maintenance equipment and training to further&#13;
improve the planning, management and execution of highway maintenance activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
I. STAFF TRAINING&#13;
2.36  The staff of HPCD and the prefectural, city and county highway departments are,&#13;
in general, experienced, but many have not been exposed to new technology and therefore&#13;
often use outmoded work methods and equipment. HPCD's staff have benefited from the&#13;
training provided by MOC and its own provincial training institutes, as well as from the&#13;
training provided under the two ongoing Bank-financed highway projects. The proposed&#13;
project would support further training efforts of HPCD by: (a) providing training to&#13;
personnel of the relevant institutes and schools and HPCD in areas of highway planning,&#13;
design, construction, maintenance, operation, and highway scientific research; and&#13;
(b) strengthening the entities in charge of implementation of the proposed project through&#13;
training of their staff and provision of modem equipment.&#13;
J. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.37  The highway development plans of Henan set goals for three different time&#13;
horizons: the long term up to the year 2020, the medium term up to 2010 and short term&#13;
up to the year 2000. The short-term plans for highway development are embodied in the&#13;
9FYP (1996-2000) for Henan. This plan will give priority to the road projects falling in&#13;
the following categories:&#13;
(a)   construction of the north-south Beijing-to-Zhuhai and the east-west&#13;
Lianyungang-Huoergousi highways, within the province, to expressway&#13;
standard;&#13;
(b)   upgrading and improvement of the existing national and provincial roads&#13;
that are congested, in order to increase their capacity and safety;&#13;
(c)   construction of missing links, improvement of interprovincial roads, and&#13;
upgrading and improvement of roads that serve as entrances and exits to&#13;
urban areas;&#13;
(d)   improvement and construction of roads serving poverty areas;&#13;
(e)   improvement and construction of county and village roads to increase the&#13;
density and coverage of the road network; and&#13;
(f)   repair and reconstruction of roads destroyed or severely damaged by&#13;
floods.&#13;
2.38 The Plan (as of the end of April 1996, the plan was not yet officially confirmed by&#13;
the provincial government) targets some Y 19.49 billion for new road construction and&#13;
rehabilitation during the 9FYP, or about Y 2.92 billion annually (Table 2.7). This&#13;
amount, which is 11I percent larger than the allocated investment during the 8FYP,&#13;
would be applied to carry out the following program:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
(a)   new construction of Expressway and Class I roads       600 km&#13;
(b)   new construction and improvement of Class II roads    1,900 km&#13;
(c)   upgrading of Class III roads                          2,000 km&#13;
(d)   upgrading/reconstruction of Class IV and substandard roads   3,000 km&#13;
Most of the above funds would be used for construction of new roads, especially high-&#13;
grade highways. Table 2.8 lists the major new high-grade highways to be constructed&#13;
during 1995-2000, as well as their estimated costs.&#13;
2.39  The 9FYP foresees an increase of 135 percent in the amount allocated to&#13;
maintenance relative to the allocation under the 8FYP.  All road construction,&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement included under the proposed project are part of the&#13;
province's 9FYP.&#13;
2.40  The Province's Master Plan for Poor Areas (8-7 Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
1994-2000) has set as its goal to provide year-round access to every poor township and&#13;
90 percent of the villages in Henan. The transport component of this plan calls for&#13;
improvement of 40 road systems consisting of 99 road segments (totaling 2,291 km), of&#13;
which 714 km are Class IV roads (rehabilitation and new construction), 1,404 km to be&#13;
upgraded from unclassified status to all-weather roads, and 173 km to be upgraded from&#13;
Class IV to Class III. The total cost of these improvements is about Y 839 million ($101&#13;
million) or about 4 percent of the Province's 9FYP highway sector investment.&#13;
2.41  The most serious problem for realizing the planned developments by the year&#13;
2000 would be availability of the required financial resources. In addition to loans from&#13;
the Bank and other similar foreign organizations, HPCD plans to borrow heavily from the&#13;
local/national banks. Generally, these loans are of a short-term nature, with no grace&#13;
period. Experience to date in Henan has been that construction costs are well controlled&#13;
and higher-than-normal (as expressed in contingency allowances) cost overruns are not&#13;
likely. Also, experience in China has shown that availability of counterpart local funds is&#13;
not a problem on the Bank-financed highway projects and is not expected to adversely&#13;
affect the proposed project. But, it could affect the remainder of the investment program.&#13;
However, the revenue projections are predicated on an increase in the size of the vehicle&#13;
fleet and gross revenues of transport operators, and both sources are likely to grow more&#13;
slowly than highway use as competition leads to increased vehicle use and more&#13;
competitive tariffs.  Consequently, the proposed highway developments must be&#13;
considered as ambitious, and probably their implementation would extend beyond the&#13;
currently planned completion dates.  However, there is a danger under these&#13;
circumstances that maintenance could be sacrificed for new construction. HPCD is aware&#13;
of this problem and, as discussed in para. 2.35, is considering ways to improve highway&#13;
investment planning and prioritization and allocating a greater share of financial&#13;
resources to maintenance.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PREPARATION&#13;
3.1   The proposed project is part of an increasing effort by the World Bank, in agreement&#13;
with the Governnent, to provide assistance to inland, lesser developed, provinces.&#13;
Highway projects, with their institutional and province-wide physical coverage, are&#13;
particularly apt to contribute to provincial economic and social development including&#13;
poverty alleviation, and to the strengthening of the administrative, planning and&#13;
management structures of the sector.&#13;
3.2   The support of highway development in Henan is particularly important in light of&#13;
the province's national strategic transport location, in addition to its own infrastructure&#13;
development requirements. One of its key transport corridors is the east-west Kaifeng-&#13;
Zhengzhou-Luoyang-Shaanxi border route. This route is a part of one of the two east-&#13;
west high-priority corridors in the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). As&#13;
discussed in para. 1. 14, the Government of China accords the NTHS the highest priority&#13;
in investment planning for the highway sector. The Bank's strategy for highway lending&#13;
has supported the development of this NTHS. The main infrastructure component of the&#13;
proposed project (the construction of the 136 km four-lane expressway between Luoyang&#13;
and Sanmenxia) constitutes an important link of the above-mentioned east-west corridor&#13;
of the NTHS. The Bank is already heavily involved in the construction of substantial&#13;
sections of this corridor. Under the Henan Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3531-&#13;
CHA), the section from Zhengzhou to Luoyang (120 km) was completed and open to&#13;
traffic on December 28, 1995. Under the Xinjiang Highway Project (Loan 3787-CHA),&#13;
construction of the section between Turpan and Urumnqi (176 km) commenced in March&#13;
1995 and is scheduled for completion by the end of 1998. Under the proposed Second&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, which was negotiated in February 1996, the 78 km&#13;
section between Weinan and Tongguan (border with Henan) would be undertaken. Under&#13;
the proposed Second Xinjiang Highway Project, which is now being prepared, the&#13;
262 km section between Urumqi and Kuitun would be constructed.&#13;
3.3  It was agreed at the identification stage of the project, that in addition to the&#13;
expressway component, the proposed project would include a rural road highway&#13;
program that focuses on poverty alleviation in the poorest counties in Henan (where&#13;
10 percent of China's poor live).&#13;
3.4   The proposed project was prepared under the directives of HPCD, with the&#13;
guidance of SPC, MOF, MOC and the People's Bank of China. The feasibility study for&#13;
the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway (LSE) and the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection,&#13;
contained in the project was prepared by HPPSDI. Following the identification mission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
in March 1995 and the preparation mission in July 1995, the project was appraised in&#13;
November 1995.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.5   The proposed project has the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   support continuing development of road infrastructure to relieve&#13;
congestion, facilitate mobility and increase the efficiency of road transport&#13;
in the interest of stimulating economic activity by supporting a key&#13;
highway link in a high-priority east-west corridor and a slice of the Henan&#13;
highway investment program in county and village roads during the 9FYP;&#13;
(b)   assist in the implementation of policies to alleviate poverty in the poor&#13;
areas of the province;&#13;
(c)   promote development of institutional capabilities of HPCD, through&#13;
training and other means, in planning, design, operations and maintenance&#13;
of Henan's highway network; and&#13;
(d)   increase the safety of road transport.&#13;
3.6   Project Performance Monitoring. The performance of the project in achieving&#13;
the previously-mentioned objectives (para. 3.5) will be monitored by the Henan&#13;
Provincial Government and the Henan Provincial Communications Department&#13;
throughout the life of the project. In addition to progress in the regular aspects of project&#13;
imnplementation, such as percent complete, procurement and disbursement, project&#13;
performance for each key objective will be monitored with the use of specific indicators&#13;
agreed with HPCD and presented in Annex 9. The project's objective related to&#13;
reduction in congestion and stimulating economic activity in the Luoyang-Sanmenxia&#13;
Corridor will be monitored using such indicators as average daily traffic, and average&#13;
vehicle speed along LSE and roads parallel to it as well as the gross output value of&#13;
agriculture and industry (GOVAI) for the counties along the Luoyang-Sanmenxia&#13;
Corridor. The project's objective pertaining to helping alleviate poverty in the poor&#13;
counties of the province will be monitored using such indicators as GOVAI; average&#13;
daily traffic volumes; and number of days rural roads are closed to traffic. The objective&#13;
concerning strengthening institutional capabilities will be monitored qualitatively based&#13;
on such indicators as sharing of new knowledge and exercising new skills by staff trained&#13;
under the project as well as improvement of performance in specific functions and&#13;
activities. The traffic safety objective will be monitored through the number of fatalities&#13;
and injuries on LSE and parallel roads as well as on the whole highway network.&#13;
Specific criteria for assessing progress in environmental and resettlement aspects will be&#13;
regularly monitored.&#13;
3.7   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for China, presented to the Board in June 1995 and reaffirmed in the March 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
progress report, supports China's strategy to reduce poverty and to relieve infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks by, inter alia, rapidly modernizing and expanding its highway system. The&#13;
proposed project furthers both of these goals by helping reduce poverty in Henan through&#13;
a program of rural highway improvements targeted at the poor counties and implementing&#13;
the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway segment of the NTHS.  Furthermore, Bank&#13;
assistance to NTHS construction should facilitate interprovincial trade and promote long-&#13;
distance and transit road traffic, which in turn would help arrest a growing regionalism&#13;
while furthering the liberalization, facilitation and cost reduction of transport, key&#13;
requirements for market-oriented reforms to succeed. Bank support is also justified by&#13;
project assistance to institutional development, through training of staff, strengthening of&#13;
key agencies of HPCD, and providing equipment for maintenance of the highway&#13;
network and operation of the LSE. The Bank's assistance is important in improving&#13;
supervision of construction of highways by facilitating the introduction of joint ventures&#13;
between foreign and local consulting firms. Bank involvement is also expected to benefit&#13;
the design and the quality of construction of the roads to be undertaken (this has been&#13;
problematic in some other projects) as well as the traffic safety on roads. The project&#13;
would also foster improved practices in the areas of environment and land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement of affected people.&#13;
C. PROJECT SCOPE&#13;
3.8   The scope of the project includes:&#13;
(a)   Construction of the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway, a 136 km, four-lane&#13;
divided access-controlled highway (74.7 percent of base cost), including&#13;

roads, construction and equipping a Science Technology Center for&#13;
research in the highway areas; and a study of organization, management&#13;
and maintenance of expressway (0.8 percent); and&#13;
(h)   A highway safety component to help reduce accidents on Henan's&#13;
highways (0.3 percent).&#13;
3.9   Construction of the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway.  The existing road&#13;
(Highway 310) between Luoyang, the capital of seven ancient dynasties in Chinese&#13;
history, with a population of about 6 million, and Sanmenxia in the western part of Henan&#13;
Province, with a population of about 2.5 million, is about 137 km long. It is the only&#13;
east-west trunk road through the middle part of Henan, and traverses Xinan, Yima,&#13;
Sanmenxia and Shanxiang urban areas as well as many industrial and mining areas along&#13;
the route. The existing road is Class II, with a 9 to 15 m wide pavement, which does not&#13;
allow for separation of the motorized and slow-moving traffic along a significant length&#13;
of the road. Some of the bridges are narrow (7.0 m) and the alignment has many sharp&#13;
horizontal curves and steep longitudinal slopes, which result in poor sight distance and&#13;
limited passing opportunities. Moreover, the pavement structure is generally weak.&#13;
Consequently, travel speeds are generally low. The existing road carries about 7,000-&#13;
9,000 medium truck equivalent (mte) per day (or about 14,000-18,000 passenger car&#13;
units-pcu-per day). The recent high increases in traffic and the expected future growth&#13;
cannot be accommodated by the existing road beyond 1998 at an acceptable level of&#13;
service. The widening of the existing road would not be feasible along most of its length&#13;
because of the extensive side development, the consequent high numbers of people to be&#13;
resettled and the related high construction costs.&#13;
3.10  For reasons outlined above, the feasibility of the construction of the LSE was&#13;
investigated along a new alignment as a part of the road between Luoyang and the Henan/&#13;
Shaanxi border. A feasibility study for the highway was carried out by HPPSDI and&#13;
covered the investigation of several alternative routings for a new highway.  The&#13;
recommended alignment is located to the south of the Yellow River and generally parallel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
with the Lianyungang-Urumqi Railway (Map IBRD 27490). Also, it is generally about 3 to&#13;
7 km away from the main cities along the existing road, thus reducing the number of people&#13;
to be resettled and providing space for these cities to expand in the future, and reducing the&#13;
length of linking roads (to LSE) to be improved or newly constructed..&#13;
3.11  The proposed expressway would be about 136 km long, consisting of four paved&#13;
lanes, each 3.75 m wide, and two paved shoulders each 3.25 m wide, and a 2 to 3 m wide&#13;
median, in accordance with the national geometric standards for highways. In addition to&#13;
minimizing the acquisition of land and resettlement of people, the alignment was selected&#13;
to avoid archeological areas and the coal mining areas. Detailed studies of such areas&#13;
were conducted as a part of the environmental assessment of the expressway.&#13;
3.12  Animals, pedestrians and slow-moving traffic such as tractors and bicycles will&#13;
not be allowed access to the LSE. Access to the LSE would be provided at seven&#13;
interchanges located at Luoyang, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi. Guanyintang, Sanmenxia,&#13;
Dongjiaokou and Sanmenxiaxi (Map IBRD 27490). Special attention was paid to the&#13;
location and spacing of interchanges (especially in the Luoyang and Sanmenxia areas), as&#13;
well as to the type and layout of these interchanges, keeping in mind that the LSE would&#13;
be operated as a toll road and that cities grow in the future. The LSE also includes about&#13;
7 very large bridges, 37 large bridges, 3 medium- and small-size bridges, 74 grade&#13;
separations, 146 underpasses to provide access to adjacent property, and about 148&#13;
culverts. Because of the rugged terrain the expressway passes through, and the often&#13;
narrow areas suitable to locate an expressway, and the restrictions imposed by the&#13;
existing highway (310) and railway, great efforts were exercised in the design of the LSE,&#13;
especially the bridges. The pavement structure consists of 16 centimeters (cm) of asphalt&#13;
concrete wearing course, 20 cm of lime-soil flyash-stabilized macadam base course, and&#13;
34 to 40 cm of lime-soil flyash-stabilized soil subbase course. The total pavement&#13;
thickness is 70 to 76 cm.&#13;
3.13  In addition to roadway construction, the LSE includes: (a) construction of one&#13;
service area that provides facilities for fuel pumping, vehicle repair, restaurants, parking&#13;
and rest areas, and commercial centers; (b) three facilities for administration and&#13;
maintenance of the expressway; and (c) electrical, electronic and mechanical installation&#13;
required for toll collection, traffic monitoring, telecommunications, and lighting of major&#13;
bridges and interchanges.&#13;
3.14  The project proposal was formally approved by SPC in September 1995. The&#13;
preliminary engineering design of LSE was prepared by HPPSDI for civil works and by&#13;
the Xian Highway Research Institute for the traffic engineering component (tolling,&#13;
monitoring, telecommunications and lighting). The preliminary engineering design and&#13;
bid documents were reviewed in April 1995 by Italian experts under the Italian Trust&#13;
Fund, and found to be generally satisfactory. The draft detailed engineering designs and&#13;
bid documents were completed in March 1996 and reviewed in the same month by the&#13;
same Italian experts who reviewed the preliminary designs and documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.15  Construction of the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection. Shaanxi Province will&#13;
construct the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE) under the proposed Second Shaanxi&#13;
Provincial Highway Project. The WTE is a part of the east-west high-priority NTHS&#13;
corridor extending from Lianyungang to Huoergousi (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous&#13;
Region). It terminates at the Shaanxi/Henan border. The section from Sanmenxia to the&#13;
border, with a length of about 98 km, was upgraded to Class II standard under the Bank-&#13;
financed Henan Provincial Highway Project (Loan 353 1-CHA) and was open to traffic by&#13;
the end of October 1995. HPCD does not plan to construct the expressway from the west&#13;
end of the LSE to the border until after the year 2000, when funds are available.&#13;
Consequently, the last 20 km of the WTE (in Shaanxi) would be underutilized and would&#13;
not achieve their full socioeconomic benefits if the WTE is not connected to the Class II&#13;
Sanmenxia-Border Road. This connection (Yangjia-Baijiazhai) lies in Henan Province.&#13;
HPCD and the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD), with the approval of&#13;
MOC, SPC and MOF, signed an agreement whereby HPCD would build this connection.&#13;
The decision to add this connection to the proposed project was made in August 1995.&#13;
3.16  The feasibility study of the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection was completed at the&#13;
end of September 1995, discussed during appraisal and revised in December 1995. This&#13;
Connection is a 6 km long two-lane expressway with provisions for future expansion to a&#13;
four-lane expressway. It will be operated as a toll road with a toll station at the border&#13;
with Shaanxi Province. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that HPCD would&#13;
coordinate closely with the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department regarding:&#13;
(a) completion of construction of this Connection by December 31, 1999, simultaneously&#13;
with the completion of the construction of the WTE in Shaanxi; (b) the location, design&#13;
and construction of the toll station at the border between Henan and Shaanxi; and (c) the&#13;
transition from a four-lane cross-section for WTE to a two-lane cross-section for YBC.&#13;
3.17  Linking Roads. The opening of the LSE would bring a significant increase in&#13;
traffic to the roads connecting it to the cities along the existing road and to other&#13;
transversal provincial roads. Without the proper linking to the cities and towns from&#13;
interchanges, the LSE would not be effectively used. Based on a comprehensive review&#13;
of the linking roads at the seven interchanges along the LSE, HPCD selected four roads&#13;
with a total length of about 17 km for new construction and improvement (Table 3.1).&#13;
Supervision of Construction of the LSE and Linking Roads and YBC&#13;
3.18  In the last four years, supervision of construction of high-grade highways in&#13;
Bank-financed highway projects in China was undertaken by a joint international/local&#13;
teams composed mostly of local staff and few international experts. Generally, the&#13;
international experts trained the local staff through formal training and on-the-job training&#13;
and established procedures at all levels of the supervision work, including on-site&#13;
inspections and laboratory testing. This arrangement represented a big improvement over&#13;
previous conditions when supervision was practically nonexistent. However, since most&#13;
of the local staff came from the Employer and its institutes, the independence of the&#13;
supervision team was limited. Under the proposed project, supervision of the LSE and its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
linking roads as well as the YBC will be carried out through a joint venture of local and&#13;
international firms, to be selected according to the Bank's guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants. This would be the first time in the highway sector that such an approach&#13;
would be tried. It ensures a much higher degree of independence of supervision and&#13;
should lead to a higher quality of construction. If successful, it would be adopted in other&#13;
Bank-financed highway projects. HPCD is committed to making it succeed. The terms&#13;
of reference, provision of housing, offices, equipment, laboratories, transport and&#13;
telecommunications, and surveying instruments as well as the likely number of personnel&#13;
and person-months and budget estimates were agreed during appraisal of the project. A&#13;
copy of the terms of reference is available in the Project Files.&#13;
Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA)&#13;
3.19  Poverty in China and Henan Province. China has an estimated population of&#13;
80 million at or below the poverty line (less than Y 300 per year/person in 1993). Nearly&#13;
all of them are rural poor, concentrated in resource-deficient areas, and comprising entire&#13;
communities located mostly in the upland sections of the interior provinces of northern&#13;
(including Henan), northwestern and southwestern China. The eighth seven-year plan for&#13;
poverty alleviation (1994-2000) has the following priorities: (a) integration of production,&#13;
education, health, family planning and transport programs into comprehensive local&#13;
intervention packages; (b) expansion of the Food for Work Program to cover the&#13;
construction of terraced agricultural lands; and (c) increased support for agricultural&#13;
extension and training and farmers' marketing systems. Lack of road access to an area&#13;
raises transport costs so substantially that only high value-to-weight products will be&#13;
profitable to market. Overall, 16.1 percent of poor county administrative villages and&#13;
3 percent of townships lack all-weather road access, and the rural road network is very&#13;
much in need of rehabilitation and upgrading.&#13;
3.20  Henan Province has a total population of 90 million people with 17 prefectures&#13;
and 152 counties. Most of the population, nearly 76 million (85 percent of total), is still&#13;
agriculture dependent. The remaining 14 million people (15 percent of total) are involved&#13;
in nonagricultural activities. Only 42 percent of Henan's GNP in 1993 was attributed to&#13;
agriculture. Twenty-eight of the counties in the Province have been identified as poor by&#13;
SPC, and an additional six counties, with a poverty line at &lt;Y 450 per capita per year,&#13;
have been identified by Henan Province   Of a total poor population of nearly 7.6&#13;
million, 68 percent (approximately 5.2 million) live in these 34 counties and their 279&#13;
townships. The remaining 2.4 million poor people (32 percent of the total) live in another&#13;
195 townships (in 16 counties) outside of the designated poor counties. The 34 poor&#13;
counties were selected for consideration of RIPA components.&#13;
3.21   Road Transport in Poverty Areas. The poor counties in Henan have 21,800 km&#13;
of roads. Of these, only 40 percent (or 8,720 km) are all-weather roads. Currently, six of&#13;
the Province's townships and some 11,000 administrative villages do not have all-&#13;
weather access to highways. Due to financial shortfalls, there is also a shortage of needed&#13;
bridges and culverts and this contributes to a further deterioration in the existing road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
network from poor drainage and water erosion. HPCD, in cooperation with the Henan&#13;
Planning Commission (HPC), Henan Poverty Alleviation Office (HPAO) and the&#13;
Leading Group for Transportation for Poverty Alleviation (LGTPA), developed a&#13;
program of Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) to rehabilitate, upgrade&#13;
and construct road systems in the province's 50 poor counties in order to provide better&#13;
access for the rural poor to the main provincial highways.&#13;
3.22 RIPA Component. The component will finance some of the road improvement&#13;
projects that meet agreed economic and social criteria, under procedures similar to the&#13;
Roads Improvement Program (RIP) components in other provincial projects in China&#13;
(Henan, Zhejiang and Guangdong). Priority will be given to rural road segments that,&#13;
through related road systems, are clearly linked to: (a) current (or planned) productive&#13;
and economically viable development projects; and (b) investments enabling landlocked&#13;
populations to have easier access to education, health and other social services.&#13;
3.23  Selection of RIPA Packages. The criteria, screening and selection process used&#13;
were agreed with HPCD, and are detailed in Annex 1. As a result, a RIPA program&#13;
consisting of 30 highway systems in 29 poor counties and with a total length of about&#13;
1,667 km was agreed with HPCD. The road segments to be included in each system were&#13;
considered in the following order of priorities:&#13;
(a)   upgrade seasonal roads to all-weather unclassified roads, including&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of culverts and bridges as necessary;&#13;
(b)   built new all-weather roads to those townships that do not have any road&#13;
connections at present;&#13;
(c)   upgrade unclassified roads to Class IV roads;&#13;
(d)   build new Class IV roads; and&#13;
(e)   rehabilitate and/or build short critical sections of Class III roads.&#13;
3.24  First Package of RIPA Systems. On the basis of an initial analysis of aggregate&#13;
data for poor counties and road systems, and of the cost effectiveness of road systems&#13;
under the RIPA program, HPCD selected a first package of RIPA systems for further&#13;
technical, economic and social feasibility analyses. This package covers eight systems&#13;
with a total length of about 662 km in eight different counties. The planned civil works&#13;
cover (a) 24 km of new roads construction, and (b) 638 km of rehabilitation. These&#13;
works also include minor drainage works and bridges, and are estimated at a total cost of&#13;
about Y 224 million. (see Annex 1).&#13;
3.25  Processing of RIPA Packages. The road systems to be financed under this&#13;
component will be drawn from the pool of RIPA systems mentioned above (para. 3.23)&#13;
and their submission for approval to the Bank will be effected in manageable packages of&#13;
projects. The documentation developed as part of the Bank approval process will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
constitute a Project File including: (a) an Economic and Social Benefit Analysis (as&#13;
detailed in Annex1) including evidence that each of the proposed systems meets the&#13;
agreed EIRR criteria; (b) a Technical Analysis, including proposed works, alternative&#13;
engineering designs, and estimated costs; (c) an Environmental Action Plan for each&#13;
system and an Environmental Impact Assessment for subprojects that involve new road&#13;
construction or substantial widening/land acquisition (para. 3.39 and Ann=x.5); and (d) a&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan for each system (where at least 200 people are affected by land&#13;
acquisition and/or resettlement). For systems affecting less than 200 persons, specific&#13;
information related to impacts, cost estimates and the implementation schedule should be&#13;
provided (para. 3.43 and Annex 6). Each package submitted for approval will also&#13;
include an Implementation Plan, covering the responsible agencies for design,&#13;
supervision and physical execution as well as the time schedule for design, preparation of&#13;
bid documents, bidding and method of procurement, bid evaluation and selection of&#13;
successful contractors and implementation of works. Also, a plan for monitoring of&#13;
RIPA would be developed (Annex.9). HPCD would submit a Maintenance Plan&#13;
describing who (township, county, prefecture) will maintain the system after completion,&#13;
the organizational structure for maintenance of the RIPA system, the equipment and&#13;
personnel needed to implement each maintenance plan and the training needs anticipated&#13;
under this plan over the implementation period, as well as the associated estimated costs&#13;
and the sources of funds to meet them. Submission of the above-mentioned documents&#13;
for each RIPA package and their approval by the Bank shall be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the RIPA subprojects.&#13;
3.26 Supervision of RIPA. The RIPA component will be managed by HPCD's&#13;
Highway Administration Bureau (HPHAB), which is already working in close&#13;
coordination with the County and Township road construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance agencies. A supervision group will be set up in Zhengzhou to be in charge&#13;
of the supervision of the whole RIPA system, and branch offices will be set up in the&#13;
areas of the RIPA subsystems. A separate supervision team would be set up for each&#13;
system to be improved in each of the poor counties, to have overall responsibility for&#13;
supervision of construction of roads under the subsystems. An adequate number of&#13;
qualified personnel would be assigned for the site supervision of the items of works under&#13;
each subsystem. The supervision groups will be composed of local personnel and are&#13;
capable of supervising the works. The same arrangement was used in the supervision of&#13;
the Road Improvement Program contained in the Henan Provincial Highway Project&#13;
(Loan 353 1-CHA) and was proven to be satisfactory.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
3.27 The equipment to be provided under the project has been identified by HPCD and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank. The agreed lists of equipment, together with their estimated costs,&#13;
would be available in the project files. These lists took into consideration the equipment&#13;
that was procured or provided under the ongoing two Bank-financed highway projects in&#13;
Henan. These lists include equipment required for operation and maintenance of the&#13;
LSE, strengthening the central laboratory, environmental monitoring, maintenance of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
existing highway network with emphasis on the RIPA roads, institutional strengthening&#13;
of selected institutions, and equipment for highway safety. The preliminary total&#13;
equipment cost is estimated at about Y 90 million ($10.8 million), of which $6.2 million&#13;
would be in foreign currencies. The Bank and HPCD agreed that the equipment lists&#13;
should be looked at as subject to reasonable change with regard to type and number, and&#13;
consequently, some flexibility should be exercised during project implementation to&#13;
properly allow for changing circumstances and needs.&#13;
3.28 Equipment for the LSE. Although the Central Laboratory was provided with&#13;
equipment under the Henan Provincial Highway Project, there is still need for additional&#13;
equipment and instruments, particularly for soils and asphalt concrete testing, to support&#13;
the construction supervision activities of the LSE. In the course of drawing up the&#13;
Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), the equipment and instruments required to&#13;
implement the environmental protection measures have been identified.  For the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways, equipment requirements have&#13;
also been identified. This equipment is in addition to the site laboratory equipment and&#13;
surveying instruments to be provided by the contractors for the civil works and the toll&#13;
collection, traffic monitoring and communication equipment to be provided by the&#13;
contractors for the electrical and mechanical (E&amp;M) works for the LSE.&#13;
3.29 Equipment for Maintenance of Roads. This equipment consists of urgently&#13;
required equipment for routine, periodic maintenance and heavy repair of roads to&#13;
replenish the equipment fleet of the county maintenance units. This equipment would be&#13;
used for maintenance of the existing highway network including RIPA roads.&#13;
3.30 Equipment for Institutional Strengthening. These consist of specialized&#13;
equipment for support of the HPHSRI, HPTC, HPTVS, HPHAB, HPCD Head Office,&#13;
HPHGHCA and WBFPO, as well as equipment for the RIPA and Road Safety&#13;
components.  The latter consist of equipment required for enforcement of speed&#13;
regulations, as well as a computer and related software for treatment of accident data and&#13;
monitoring of the roads improvement program in poor counties of the province.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Training&#13;
3.31  The purpose of the Institutional Strengthening and Training (IST) component is to&#13;
strengthen HPCD capabilities in the following priority areas: (a) high-grade highway&#13;
construction supervision and operations; (b) project implementation management;&#13;
(c) highway planning; and (d) maintenance of high-grade highways and other roads. It is&#13;
also intended to strengthen HPCD's capabilities in the new areas of investment,&#13;
specifically in (e) roads improvement for poverty alleviation and (f) road traffic safety.&#13;
The IST component builds on what was provided in this area under the two previous&#13;
Bank-financed highway projects in Henan. It includes: (i) organizational strengthening&#13;
of HPCD and some of its related institutes; (ii) training of HPCD personnel in China and&#13;
abroad in high-priority areas; and (iii) strengthening new functional areas such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
management of high-grade highways, planning and implementation of RIPA and&#13;
highway traffic safety (Table 3.2).&#13;
3.32 Organizational Strengthening. This element will strengthen provincial highway&#13;
management, research and training organizations through (a) the development of training&#13;
staff capabilities to deliver training in new areas; (b) bolstering of their hardware and&#13;
equipment in the performance of new functional capacities; and (c) expansion of the&#13;
provincial and national functions of the Henan Scientific Research Institute (HSRI). This&#13;
element covers professional and specialized training for 294 persons (or 309 person-&#13;
months). Table 3.3 contains a summary of all the training to be provided under the&#13;
project. Moreover, the project will enable the construction of a Science and Technology&#13;
Center at the Henan Scientific Research Institute.&#13;
3.33  The following HPCD organizations, institutes and centers will be strengthened:&#13;
(a)   The Henan Scientific Research Institute (Chart 5) is the only&#13;
comprehensive research organization in the Province, and is a center for&#13;
testing civil engineering designs, materials and equipment. The Institute&#13;
has a current capacity for research, development, testing, manufacture and&#13;
technology consulting. However, to meet the future needs of Henan&#13;
Province (as well as of other provinces that may require such support),&#13;
HPCD has decided to establish a Scientific Technology Center within the&#13;
Institute. The Center will be an advanced and permanent base for testing&#13;
the main scientific and technological aspects of large highway engineering&#13;
projects, particularly in the area of highway construction quality control.&#13;
It will also address vehicle inspection and testing, and the training of&#13;
HPCD management staff. As a result of a feasibility study on the location,&#13;
functions and size of the Center, HPCD has decided to house both the&#13;
Center and the Institute on the site of the new facility. This will improve&#13;
communications between the Center and the Institute, as well as between&#13;
both of them and HPCD and provide more effective management of joint&#13;
resources.&#13;
(b)   The Henan Provincial Transport Polytechnic (HTP) (Chart 6) and the&#13;
Henan Provincial Transport Vocational School (HTVS) (Chart 7) are&#13;
the two main training institutions affiliated with HPCD. They provide&#13;
academic training for future HPCD technicians and skilled workers and&#13;
operators, as well as short-term professional training courses for current&#13;
staff. The Polytechnic also provides continuing education training for&#13;
road transport personnel at prefecture and county levels. Both of these&#13;
entities received institutional strengthening under the Henan Provincial&#13;
Highway Project and what is provided under this project strengthens them&#13;
further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(c)   The Henan Provincial High-Grade Highway Administration Bureau&#13;
(HPHGHAB) (Chart 3) will be in charge of implementation of new high-&#13;
grade highways including financing, land acquisition and resettlement,&#13;
construction management, maintenance, operations and management of&#13;
completed high-grade highways. When fully operational, HPHGHAB&#13;
would have a staff of 115 at headquarters and 260 at all levels. This&#13;
number does not include the toll collectors.&#13;
(d)   The World Bank-Financed Projects Office (WBFPO) (Chart 4), which&#13;
is responsible for comprehensive management and implementation of&#13;
construction projects, as well as coordination and monitoring of&#13;
implementation of all components. WBFPO organizes tenders and&#13;
evaluation of bids for all components financed by the project and is&#13;
responsible for procurement of equipment under the proposed project.&#13;
3.34 Staff Development. Staff development and awareness training (both within&#13;
China and abroad) is intended for middle-level and specialized staff in HPCD&#13;
organizations and other project personnel. Short-term training will be conducted in the&#13;
areas of Highway Design, High-Grade Highway Operations and Management,&#13;
Construction Supervision, Project Implementation Management, Traffic Engineering and&#13;
Traffic Safety, Highway Planning and Analysis, Highway Maintenance, and Financial&#13;
Management. Overall, this element will involve training for 121 persons for a total of&#13;
112.5 person-months (Table 3.3).&#13;
3.35 Study of Organization, Management and Maintenance of High-Grade&#13;
Highways. This study would: (a) identify, analyze and recommend ways to improve the&#13;
organization, operations and management of expressways; (b) develop the best&#13;
organizational setup to manage and operate high-grade highway entities in Henan;&#13;
(c) assess the requirements for an expressway organization to comply with international&#13;
standards of operational, maintenance and financial management, to ensure that the&#13;
highway is well operated and maintained and that toll revenues are properly collected and&#13;
managed and that expenditures (both for investment and for adequate maintenance) are&#13;
well-planned. Annex 2 presents the outline terms of reference for this study. The study&#13;
will be conducted by a team of local experts supported by international experts.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that HPCD shall: (i) by November 30, 1996,&#13;
establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the concerned provincial&#13;
agencies and the central government to guide the study on the organization, management&#13;
and maintenance of high-grade highways and provide comments on the results and&#13;
recommendations thereof; (i) by September 30, 1998, complete the said study in&#13;
accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; and furnish the study,&#13;
together with the comments of the Leading Group, to the Bank for review; and (iii) take&#13;
appropriate steps to implement the recommendations of the said study, taking into&#13;
consideration the comments thereon of the said Leading Group and the Bank. The&#13;
results of this study will be beneficial not only to Henan Province but also to the rest of&#13;
China.&#13;

3.36  Over the 1990-94 period, on the average 16,700 traffic accidents per year occurred&#13;
on Henan's highways, resulting in 3,500 fatalities and 11,300 injuries. As traffic volumes&#13;
are expected to increase at a fast rate in the future, the number of accidents is expected to&#13;
follow  suit unless tremendous efforts are exerted to reduce accidents.  Anne.3&#13;
summarizes the existing road safety situation in Henan and related problems and presents&#13;
an implementable road safety program, which was discussed and agreed with HPCD and&#13;
the Traffic Police.&#13;
3.37  The design of the LSE included in the project as well as its linking roads was&#13;
reviewed from a safety point of view by the Italian design review consultants and Danish&#13;
and Norwegian safety experts. Consequently, those designs have been prepared to a high&#13;
standard and reflect safety considerations adequately. The road safety program included&#13;
under the proposed project comprises:&#13;
(a)   Establishing a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination to coordinate&#13;
between HPCD and the Traffic Police (the main agencies involved in&#13;
highway safety) as well as a Traffic Safety Secretariat to prepare the work&#13;
for the Leading Group. The Leading Group and the Traffic Safety&#13;
Secretariat were established in March 1996;&#13;
(b)   Improving traffic accident reporting forms, reviewing the geographic&#13;
location (of accidents) coding system, providing improved software for&#13;
accident data analyses and related training of staff;&#13;
(c)   Establishing a Road Safety Unit in HPCD to undertake accident black spot&#13;
identification, design and carry out a pilot program of black spot&#13;
improvement, and establish safety audit procedures and checks; training of&#13;
three staff to be assigned to the Unit by a foreign expert for one month and&#13;
provision of 1.5 person-months of foreign experts for general support of&#13;
the Unit, review of results of studies and guidance on new activities to be&#13;
undertaken. HPCD agreed to allocate Y 10 million ($1.2 million) to the&#13;
Road Safety Unit during 1997-2000 to undertake safety studies/research&#13;
and to implement on a pilot basis physical improvements to accident black&#13;
spots. This sum is reflected in the project cost summary (Table 3.4);&#13;
(d)   A study on accident contributing factors (AnnexA4 contains the terms of&#13;
reference);&#13;
(e)   Training in first aid will be introduced in the curricula for police training&#13;
and driver training and training in child psychology of police officers&#13;
responsible for training of school children in traffic safety;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(f)   Provision of equipment to support the above-mentioned activities, which&#13;
includes: two computers, two printers, one plotter, a still camera, a video&#13;
camera and monitor, and a speed radar; and&#13;
(g)   Evaluation of the implementation of the Henan Road Safety Program by&#13;
an independent local expert (1 person-month).&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Henan would establish and maintain:&#13;
(a) a Leading Group for traffic safety coordination, policy-making and planning, with&#13;
functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank; (b) a Traffic Safety Secretariat to&#13;
prepare work for the Leading Group; and (c) a Road Safety Unit within HPCD, with&#13;
functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank to carry out a pilot black spot&#13;
improvement program and establish safety audit procedures and checks under terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Bank Also, agreement was reached during negotiations that&#13;
HPCD would, pursuant to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank: (i) by December 31,&#13;
1998, complete a study of the factors contributing to traffic accidents;(ii) by December&#13;
31, 2000, complete a black spot identification and improvement program; and (iii) by&#13;
December 31, 2001, have an expert acceptable to the Bank prepare an evaluation of its&#13;
Road Safety Program according to indicators acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.38  Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been carried out for LSE and the&#13;
link roads, Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection and the first package of RIPA. Enviromnental&#13;
Action Plans (EAPs) have been prepared, incorporating Bank comments on earlier drafts,&#13;
and found satisfactory to the Bank, as were the EIAs. The environmental summary was&#13;
distributed to the Board on October 12, 1995.&#13;
3.39  For the RIPA component of the proposed project, it was agreed that a Sectoral&#13;
Environmental Assessment approach would be applied. All RIPA subprojects will be&#13;
classified into two categories. Category I subprojects are those with no new road&#13;
construction nor substantial widening/land acquisition, etc. Since no major adverse&#13;
impacts are anticipated, only EAPs will be prepared for this category of subprojects.&#13;
Category II subprojects are those with new road construction or substantial widening/land&#13;
acquisition, etc. For these, both EIAs and EAPs will be prepared. EIA reports and EAPs&#13;
for the first-year package of subprojects were prepared and submitted to the Bank in&#13;
October 1995. Only three of these systems were classified as Category II subprojects.&#13;
All project EAPs and ElAs are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.40 Major environmental impacts include noise and air pollution during the&#13;
construction and operation phases, alteration of hydrological regimes, soil erosion and&#13;
impacts on local ecology during the construction, impacts on cultural relics, and&#13;
transportation of construction materials.&#13;
3.41  The EAPs specified the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental&#13;
monitoring plans, institutional arrangements to implement the EAPs, training and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
equipment requirements, and the budget needed for environmental protection. Major&#13;
mitigation measures include adequate selection of alignment, appropriate design of&#13;
culverts and overpasses/underpasses to minimize social disruption, reconstruction of&#13;
irrigation channels where appropriate, water sprinkling to prevent dust during the&#13;
construction, construction of noise barriers and forest belts, installation of double-glass&#13;
windows, etc., to minimize noise and air pollution during the operation phase. The&#13;
engineering design and technical specifications for the highways will incorporate&#13;
appropriate measures required to be taken for environmental protection.  It was&#13;
ascertained that the proposed highways would not affect ecologically sensitive areas and&#13;
that their construction and operation should have no adverse impact on the environment&#13;
through the implementation of EAPs. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs is presented&#13;
in Annex 5 and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Project File and the&#13;
Public Information Center. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from HPCD that:&#13;
(a) the environmental protection measures stipulated in the EAPs and preparation of&#13;
EAPs for RIPA systems for subsequent years would be carried out in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) HPCD would furnish to the Bank an annual&#13;
environmental monitoring report for LSE and its linking roads during the construction&#13;
phase andfor each of the first three years following completion of construction..&#13;
E. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT ISSUES&#13;
3.42  Land Acquisition and Project Impacts. Construction of the LSE and its linking&#13;
roads, the YBC and the RIPA component roads (first year's program) will require&#13;
permanent acquisition of about 1,060 hectares (ha) of land and will affect 11,567 persons.&#13;
Out of these, 3,548 will need to be relocated. Another 235 ha of land would be required&#13;
to be leased temporarily during construction, affecting 1,903 persons. The project will&#13;
also affect two enterprises employing 32 people. Project impacts were identified with the&#13;
help of a detailed census survey of affected persons and properties carried out by the&#13;
Henan Communications Planning, Survey and Design Institute (HCPSDI). A baseline&#13;
socioeconomic survey of the affected persons will be carried out before the initiation of&#13;
resettlement implementation to determine their existing income levels and standards of&#13;
living. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the entire project is about&#13;
Y 207 million ($25 million).&#13;
3.43  Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). In order to ensure mitigation of adverse&#13;
impacts of land acquisition and plan resettlement/rehabilitation activities as a&#13;
development program for the affected persons, detailed strategies and a framework for&#13;
implementation of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) activities has been established&#13;
by HPHGHCA. The implementation framework is described in the RAPs prepared for&#13;
the LSE, linking roads, the YBC and the first-year package of RIPA. A summary of&#13;
these RAPs is presented in Annex 6. A copy of the RAPs will be deposited in the Public&#13;
Information Center. A separate RAP will be prepared for each system under the RIPA&#13;
component where 200 or more persons are affected by land acquisition and/or&#13;
resettlement. For systems affecting less than 200 persons, although there would be no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
need to prepare detailed RAPs, specific information related to project impacts, cost&#13;
estimates and the implementation schedule will be prepared.&#13;
3.44  Resettlement Strategies. The affected persons currently engaged in agriculture&#13;
and whose lands are acquired due to the project will be provided with alternative&#13;
agricultural lands through land redistribution within the same production teams, or&#13;
village. If some of the affected persons cannot be provided agricultural land (due to&#13;
reduction in per capita landholding below the minimum limit fixed for the affected&#13;
village), the affected persons will be provided jobs in nonagricultural enterprises.&#13;
However, no job creation would be necessary under the current project since the residual&#13;
per capita landholding of all affected persons are substantially above the minimum limit&#13;
of 0.1O mu for Henan Province. Affected enterprises will be relocated to new sites&#13;
provided by the villages and paid for by the project. The elderly persons affected by the&#13;
project will be provided pensions.&#13;
3.45  Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations. The affected&#13;
people will be informed through newspaper, radio, television, etc. about the project and&#13;
the proposed land acquisition and resettlement program. The Land Acquisition and&#13;
Resettlement (LAR) institutions will also disseminate information through meetings,&#13;
documents and notices. The affected persons will be informed about the compensation&#13;
standards, the LAR institutions at the various levels, the arrangements for provision of&#13;
nonagricultural jobs, the provisions for redressal of grievances and the proposed&#13;
arrangements for internal and external monitoring of the LAR program. This will be&#13;
done by distributing a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) to each affected&#13;
household. The RIB will be distributed to the affected households two months after the&#13;
RAP has been approved by the Bank.&#13;
3.46  Implementation.  Implementation of the RAP will be carried out in a&#13;
participatory manner, with the involvement of affected people and their representatives.&#13;
Avenues will be available to the affected persons for redressal of grievances connected to&#13;
any aspect of land acquisition and resettlement. Implementation of the resettlement and&#13;
the construction program for LSE, the YBC, linking roads, and first-year package of&#13;
RIPA will be linked to ensure that all LAR activities are completed before the initiation&#13;
of construction activities in any section. It is expected that LAR activities for the LSE&#13;
will be completed in February 1997, whereas LSE construction activities are expected to&#13;
start in March 1997. A special unit has been created in the Coordination Division of&#13;
HPHGHCA to coordinate the implementation of the LAR program.  The actual&#13;
implementation will be carried out by the local governments of Luoyang and Sanmenxia&#13;
prefectures and the respective county, township and village authorities. Funds for RAP&#13;
implementation will be paid by HPHGHCA. A Resettlement Coordination Group headed&#13;
by the Deputy Provincial Governor has also been formed at the provincial level for&#13;
interagency coordination of RAP implementation.  Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations from Henan Provincial Government that all LAR activities with respect to&#13;
LSE, linking roads, YBC and RIPA subprojects would be completed according to the&#13;
RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
3.47  Grievance Redressal and Appeals Process. If any affected person is dissatisfied&#13;
with any aspect of land acquisition and/or resettlement, he/she can first appeal to the&#13;
resettlement office/local government office at the township/county level. If the decision&#13;
of this office is not considered satisfactory, the person can lodge an appeal with the&#13;
project office or the government office at the city level. Another appeal, if necessary, can&#13;
be made to the provincial coordination group. In case the affected person is still not&#13;
satisfied, he/she can also approach the people's court. The decision of this court will be&#13;
final and binding. These arrangements are considered satisfactory.&#13;
3.48 Monitoring and Evaluation. Both internal and external monitoring of RAP&#13;
implementation will be carried out to ensure implementation in accordance with&#13;
provisions of the RAP. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the Administrative&#13;
office of HPHGHCA. An external, independent agency has been engaged to conduct&#13;
external monitoring and evaluation of RAP implementation. Assurances were obtained&#13;
at negotiations that HPCD would submit to the Bank. (a) internal monitoring reports&#13;
every six months, with the first due on September 30, 1996, (b) external monitoring&#13;
reports every six months, with the first due on December 31, 1996; and (c) a final&#13;
monitoring and evaluation report after project completion by December 31, 2001. Also,&#13;
assurances were obtained at negotiations from HPG that the monitoring of the&#13;
socioeconomic impact of the resettlement activities with respect to the LSE, YBC, linking&#13;
roads, and RIPA roads would be carried out according to the RAPs in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. Implementation of the RAPs would also be monitored through&#13;
routine project supervision and project quarterly progress reports.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.49  The total project is estimated to cost about Y 5.03 billion or about $606 million&#13;
equivalent, including land acquisition and physical and price contingencies as&#13;
summarized in the following table and as detailed in the Project Cost Summary (Table&#13;
3.4). This estimate does not include taxes (estimated at about Y 134 million). The&#13;
foreign exchange cost is estimated at about $211 million, or about 35 percent of the total.&#13;
Base costs are estimated in December 1995 prices. Physical contingencies are calculated&#13;
at 10 percent of the base cost of civil works and construction supervision.  Price&#13;
contingencies have been calculated for foreign costs, using international annual escalation&#13;
factors of 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent in 1997, and 2.5 percent in each of 1998, 1999,&#13;
2000 and 2001. Price contingencies for local costs are based on local annual escalation&#13;
factors of 10.5 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent in&#13;
1999, and 6.2 percent in 2000 and 2001.&#13;
3.50  The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from preliminary&#13;
or final engineering designs. The costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard&#13;
manuals for labor and equipment productivity, the related annually updated costs and the&#13;
current market costs of materials. The unit rates were checked against the unit prices&#13;
provided in recent bids for similar highway works executed under Bank financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
3.51   The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by&#13;
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Zhengzhou,&#13;
taxes, spare parts, and related training if needed to operate and maintain the equipment.&#13;
The estimated cost of consulting services are based on recent contracts for similar&#13;
services under ongoing highway projects.&#13;

G. FINANCING&#13;
3.52 The Bank loan of $210 million would finance about 35 percent of the total project&#13;
cost or 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government (MOC) would&#13;
provide the equivalent of about $105 million, while Henan Province would provide the&#13;
equivalent of about $291 million to meet the remaining costs of the project, including&#13;
contingencies. MOC's funding would be restricted to the construction of the LSE and&#13;
RIPA. The Bank loan of $210 million would be at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-&#13;
based US dollar single currency loans. It would be lent to the Ministry of Finance for a&#13;
maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be&#13;
onlent to Henan Province at the same rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower with&#13;
0.75 percent per year commitment fee on the outstanding balance, beginning 60 days&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
after loan signing, less any waiver. Agreement was reached with the Borrower at&#13;
negotiations that it would onlend the proceeds of the loan to HPG on these terms. HPG&#13;
would bear the foreign exchange risks. The Government of China and Henan Province&#13;
have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms for the project in order&#13;
to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely&#13;
matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about&#13;
75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based product&#13;
in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that&#13;
would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any&#13;
interest rate risk. China is eligible for single currency loans under the expanded program.&#13;
This loan represents 8.5 percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD lending program to China,&#13;
well within the 50 percent volume guideline approved by the Bank The details of project&#13;
financing are shown in the following table.&#13;

H. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.53  Implementing Agencies.  The implementation of the project would be the&#13;
responsibility of HPCD. The Henan High-Grade Highway Construction Authority&#13;
(HPHGHCA) would be the executing agency for the implementation of the Yangjia-&#13;
Baijiazhai Connection and the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway, including their&#13;
construction supervision and equipment to operate and maintain LSE, and for&#13;
environmental monitoring as well as for the study of organization, management and&#13;
maintenance of high-grade highways. HPHAB would be the executing agency for the&#13;
RIPA (construction and supervision), the pilot program for identification and treatment of&#13;
accident black spots, as well as for the equipment for maintenance of the highway&#13;
network (other than for the high-grade highways). WBFPO in HPCD would be the&#13;
coordinating agency for the whole project and for grouping of trainees for overseas&#13;
training and study tours, and procurement of equipment. WBFPO and the Education&#13;
Division of HPCD would be responsible for training. Training programs would be&#13;
coordinated with those in other ongoing Bank-financed highway projects by MOC.&#13;
Implementation of the road safety component will be the responsibility of HPCD and the&#13;
Traffic Police in PSB, with the Leading Group for Traffic Safety Coordination providing&#13;
coordination between them. The CMC International Tendering Company has been&#13;
retained by HPCD as the procurement agency for all aspects of civil works of the project&#13;
requiring ICB and for equipment to be procured from abroad. The supervision of&#13;
construction of the LSE and its link roads and YBC would be carried out by a joint&#13;
venture of foreign and local firms. Upon completion, it is expected that the LSE and&#13;
YBC would be operated and maintained by the Henan High-Grade Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau and the linking roads by HPHAB. Since the LSE is a segment of&#13;
the NTHS, MOC would also provide general supervision and guidance for execution of&#13;
the project.&#13;
3.54  LSE and YBC. The implementation program for the project as a whole including&#13;
the LSE and YBC is shown in Annex 7. All civil works for the LSE would be tendered at&#13;
the same time. The traffic engineering works would be tendered as one contract about the&#13;
middle of the period for construction of the civil works for the LSE. The invitation for&#13;
prequalification of contractors for civil works for the LSE was issued in January 1996 and&#13;
the whole prequalification process would be finished by May 1996.&#13;
3.55  The detailed designs and bidding documents for the LSE (eight contract sections)&#13;
would be completed by May 1996 and for the YBC (one contract section) by February&#13;
1997. Acquisition of land and the resettlement process for LSE started in October 1995&#13;
and is expected to be completed by the end of February 1997. The installation of&#13;
electrical and mechanical (E&amp;M) systems for the operation of the LSE would be&#13;
scheduled to commence around June 1999 and be completed by June 2001. The&#13;
construction of service facilities along the LSE is expected to start in 1998 and be&#13;
completed by November 2000. The LSE is expected to be completed by June 2001.&#13;
Construction of YBC is expected to commence around October 1997 and be completed&#13;
by November 1999, at or before the completion time for the Weinan-Tongguan&#13;
Expressway in Shaanxi Province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
3.56  Supervision of Construction of the LSE and the YBC. The supervision of the&#13;
LSE, the YBC and the link roads would be carried out by a joint venture between foreign&#13;
consultants and local consultants headed by a chief engineer with headquarters in&#13;
Luoyang. There would be a resident engineer on-site for each of the nine civil works&#13;
contract sections.  About 4,500 person-months of consulting services are needed.&#13;
Invitations to international short-listed firms will be issued in April 1996, and the&#13;
selection of the joint venture is expected to be completed by November 1996. The joint&#13;
venture is expected to mobilize in January/February 1997 and its staff is expected to be&#13;
engaged in supervision activities in early March 1997.&#13;
3.57  Linking Roads.  The preliminary designs for all the linking roads were&#13;
completed and the final engineering designs and the bid documents are under way and are&#13;
expected to be completed by May 1996. Construction of the linking roads is expected to&#13;
start in May 1999 and be completed in September 2000. Supervision of the construction&#13;
of the linking roads will be the responsibility of the joint venture as mentioned above.&#13;
3.58 Road Improvements for Poverty Alleviation Program (RIPA). The relevant&#13;
highway departments at city or prefecture levels are responsible for the preparation of&#13;
designs and bid documents for the subsystems included in RIPA and these documents&#13;
would be reviewed and approved by HPHAB. The construction of the subsystems&#13;
included in the first package is expected to start in March 1997 and to be completed by&#13;
the end of 1998. The construction of the subsystems to be included in the second and&#13;
third packages is expected to start in 1998 and 1999, respectively, and to be completed by&#13;
the end of 1999 and 2000, respectively. For procurement purposes, RIPA subsystems&#13;
will be divided into several manageable contract (bid) sections. Construction of the&#13;
RIPA roads will be supervised in accordance with the arrangements summarized in para.&#13;
3.26.&#13;
3.59  Training. Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained would be&#13;
developed by WBFPO, according to the training needs identified and agreed with the&#13;
Bank. Those to be trained abroad would be given intensive English training, and each&#13;
trainee would be required to submit a report on training received to his/her parent&#13;
department or agency. The comprehensive training program would be open to all&#13;
highway staff and would be administered by HPCD. Moreover, HPCD has indicated that&#13;
training to be provided under the project would be related to career development and the&#13;
professional growth of the selected staff. At negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
HPCD shall, by June 30 of each year commencing in 1997, furnish a rolling two-year&#13;
training implementation schedule to the Bank and shall carry out the training under a&#13;
program acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.60 Equipment. The responsibility for procurement of equipment would be divided&#13;
between HPHGHCA  and HPHAB.  HPHGHCA  would be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of equipment related to the LSE.  HPHAB  would administer the&#13;
procurement of equipment for the maintenance of the highway network (other than the&#13;
LSE).  WBFPO would coordinate the preparation of specifications and their bid&#13;
documents for equipment as well as bid evaluation and acceptance of their delivery. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
equipment required for laboratories, environmental monitoring, strengthening of highway&#13;
network maintenance and institutional strengthening would be procured at an early stage&#13;
of project implementation (1997/98), while that for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
LSE is scheduled to be procured toward the end of construction of the LSE (2000).&#13;
3.61  The project as a whole is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2002, with the&#13;
loan closing date stipulated as December 31, 2002. The implementation schedule for the&#13;
project is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.62  Operations of the LSE and YBC. Henan Province intends to operate the LSE&#13;
and YBC as toll roads consistent with their design.  The High-Grade Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau will be responsible for operating and maintaining the LSE and&#13;
YBC following their completion. Tolls would be collected at about eight points (Map&#13;
IBRD 27490). To ensure that the toll rates would be appropriately structured and that toll&#13;
levels would not lead to a substantial reduction in the benefits of highway investment, the&#13;
rationale for setting the level of tolling would be determined based on the findings of a&#13;
study to be undertaken by the Province, which takes into consideration latest experience&#13;
with operation of toll roads in Henan Province and the rest of China as well as similar&#13;
studies done under Bank-financed highway projects in China. Assurances were obtained&#13;
at negotiations from HPG that HPCD shall undertake, and by March 31, 2000, furnish to&#13;
the Bankfor its review and comments, an analysis and recommendation for the structure&#13;
of toll rates on the LSE, taking into consideration the results of the recent studies on toll&#13;
rates conducted under other Bank-financed highway projects in China and the recent&#13;
experience with toll rates on major roads in Henan Province and other parts of China.&#13;
I. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.63  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in the following&#13;
table. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into account the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995," and&#13;
revised in January 1996, as well as the experience gained from previous Bank-financed&#13;
highway  projects.   The documentation, for procurement, which  covers the&#13;
prequalification of contractors, ICB and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for civil&#13;
works, ICB for goods, and consultant services contracts has been standardized for&#13;
Chinese conditions in cooperation between the Chinese government and the Bank.&#13;
Standard documents would be used for all relevant procurement processes under the&#13;
project.&#13;

3.64  Works. The civil works for the LSE would be divided into eight contract sections&#13;
and those for the YBC would form one contract. Electromechanical works would be&#13;
grouped into one contract. Administration and maintenance buildings, service areas and&#13;
toll plazas would be carried out in several small contracts. Contracts for civil works for&#13;
the YBC and the LSE and for the electromechanical works for the LSE with a total cost&#13;
of $420.8 million would be procured under ICB procedures. Contracts would be bid on a&#13;
slice and package basis; qualified firms would be allowed to bid for more than one&#13;
contract so as to attract international contractors and large Chinese contractors. The&#13;
contract for electromechanical works would be bid later during the construction of the&#13;
LSE. All contractors for the nine ICB contracts for civil works would be prequalified.&#13;
The General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project was published in the UN&#13;
Development Business No. 426 on November 16, 1995. This GPN served as a specific&#13;
procurement notice for the civil works contracts for LSE (each costing more than $10&#13;
million). For the remaining large contract for electromechanical works, invitations to bid&#13;
would be advertised as specific procurement notices in the UN Development Business&#13;
and/or well-known technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide&#13;
international circulation. Domestic contractors competing under ICB would be eligible&#13;
for a 7.5 percent price preference. Domestic contractors are expected to be competitive&#13;
for all contracts under this project.&#13;
3.65  Other works, including small service facilities (toll plazas, maintenance depots,&#13;
service and rest areas, administrative buildings, etc., estimated to cost about $20.0&#13;
million), link roads (with a cost of $6.7 million), some of the RIPA roads (with a cost of&#13;
$45.0 million) and the research center (with a cost of $3.1 million) would be awarded&#13;
following NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. These works would involve contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than $2 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount of about&#13;
$74.8 million. Since these contracts are small in value and scattered throughout the&#13;
Province and would be implemented over a four-year period, ICB would therefore be&#13;
neither justified nor practical, but foreign firms would not be precluded from bidding.&#13;
3.66 Based on experience with the Road Improvement Program (RIP) in the ongoing&#13;
Zhejiang (Loan 3471-CHA), Guangdong (Loan 3530-CHA, and Henan (Loan 3531-&#13;
C-A) Provincial Highway projects, generally not more than three bids are received for&#13;
contracts whose value is $2.0 million or less. Moreover, most of the bidders come from&#13;
the immediate area of the contract works. Larger contractors generally do not wish to&#13;
mobilize for small contracts. RIPA involves smaller works and lower value contracts&#13;
than RIP, and the works are spread over a very large geographic area. In recognition of&#13;
this, and in order to reduce unnecessary administrative overhead and expedite the&#13;
procurement of these small contracts, but at the same time ensuring sufficient&#13;
competition, RIPA contracts costing $1.0 million (Y 8.3 million) or less up to $27.0&#13;
million in aggregate may be awarded under simplified procurement procedures, whereby&#13;
a minimum of three bids would be invited from qualified contractors and bids would be&#13;
opened in public. This has the advantages of time savings in the bidding process as well&#13;
as creating more job opportunities for the poor during construction. Since employment&#13;
creation is important in the case of RIPA roads, when the two lowest evaluated bids are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
within 5 percent of each other, the number of local people to be employed by each&#13;
contractor would be considered in the final award of contract. This will be done by&#13;
assigning a value of Y 300 per person-month and by deducting the value of employment&#13;
from the bid price. The bidder with the lowest "adjusted" evaluated bid price would be&#13;
selected. Because of its innovative nature, the results of this procedure would be&#13;
subjected to a mid-term review so that its effectiveness at job creation may be evaluated.&#13;
3.67  In the case of very small RIPA contracts, and under special conditions to be&#13;
justified by HPHAB, force account could be used for procurement of civil works with a&#13;
total estimated cost of 20 percent, about $18.0 million, of the total RIPA component.&#13;
Force account would also be used for improvement of black spots, with a total estimated&#13;
value of $1.2 million (not Bank-financed). This is justified on the basis of the small&#13;
value of the works and their wide geographic distribution. The contracts for power&#13;
supply, with a total estimated cost of about $4.0 million and involving works scattered&#13;
along the LSE and the YBC, would be awarded by direct contracting with the local&#13;
electricity companies, which are monopolies. The total estimated cost of the works to be&#13;
procured by force account or direct negotiations is $23.2 million.&#13;
3.68  Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than&#13;
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. All other items or groups of items&#13;
covering minor maintenance equipment, laboratories, highway safety, research and&#13;
environmental protection purposes estimated to cost less than $250,000 per contract&#13;
package, in an aggregate amount not exceeding $2.2 million would be procured following&#13;
international shopping procedures on the basis of a comparison of price quotations&#13;
solicited from at least three suppliers eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement.&#13;
Domestic manufactures competing under ICB would be eligible for a margin of&#13;
preference in the comparison of bids of 15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom&#13;
duties, whichever is lower.&#13;
3.69  Consultants. All consultants required for construction supervision (cost of $20.3&#13;
million); staff training (cost of $1.1 million); and studies of organization, management&#13;
and maintenance of high-grade highways, and highway safety (cost of $1.2 million)&#13;
would be selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise available in&#13;
the various provincial universities and institutes in the highway subsector would be used&#13;
as much as possible.&#13;
3.70  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. HPCD requested advance&#13;
contracting and retroactive financing in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Consultants for supervision of construction of the LSE and the Research&#13;
Center. This would allow construction of housing, office space and the&#13;
laboratory for the main office of the supervision joint venture in the&#13;
vicinity of Mianchi to be completed by the time contractors commence&#13;
construction of the civil works for the LSE on March 1, 1997; and startup&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
of supervision of the Research Center. The amount subject to retroactive&#13;
financing is estimated at about $370,000.&#13;
(b)   Construction of the Research Center.  This would allow startup of&#13;
construction of the Center by July 1996. The amount subject to retroactive&#13;
financing is estimated at about $230,000.&#13;
3.71  Agreement to the above two requests for advance contracting and retroactive&#13;
financing is recommended, subject to HPCD completing all Bank requirements, including&#13;
those for procurement, environment and resettlement. The total amount subject to&#13;
retroactive financing is estimated at about $600,000. All of this amount would apply to&#13;
expenditures after January 1, 1996.&#13;
3.72  Bank Review. Prior review procedures would be used for: (a) civil works&#13;
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with&#13;
an estimated cost of more than $250,000 per contract; and (c) consulting services with an&#13;
estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals. In&#13;
the case of consultancy service contracts, all terms of reference and single-source&#13;
selections, regardless of the value of the contract, are subject to prior review. Prior&#13;
review would apply to about 77 percent and 68 percent of the total contract values of&#13;
works and goods, respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-&#13;
review procedures would be followed. The nature of equipment (too many items with a&#13;
relatively low cost), the number of packages, and HPCD being an experienced borrower&#13;
from the Bank (the proposed project is the third highway project in Henan) justify the&#13;
relatively low percent of total contracts for goods (68 percent) that are subject to prior&#13;
review.&#13;
J. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;

3.74   To  facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened with an&#13;
authorized allocation of $15 million equivalent, the estimated average expenditures for a&#13;
four-month period. The account would be opened in US dollars in a bank acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, and managed by the Henan Provincial Finance Bureau. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or whenever the&#13;
Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.&#13;
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 3.5, which takes into&#13;
consideration the project disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the&#13;
potential risks of delay in project implementation.&#13;
3.75   Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done&#13;
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the&#13;
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and costed at unit rates in the&#13;
contracts will be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision teams/units and&#13;
payments authorized by HPHGHCA and HPHAB. Retroactive financing of up to&#13;
$600,000 would be applied to expenditures made after January 1, 1996 to provide for&#13;
supervision activities for the LSE and the Research Center as well as for startup of&#13;
construction of the Research Center. Disbursements for staff training in China or abroad&#13;
would be made from the Special Account against the actual costs of travel, subsistence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
and tuition or training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million&#13;
or less; training, force account, contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or&#13;
less, and contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for firms and&#13;
$50,000 equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained&#13;
by the implementing agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
K. AUDITING&#13;
3.76  The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration&#13;
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing of project expenditures. Actual audits would be&#13;
carried out for SAA by the Henan Branch of SAA or the Henan Provincial Audit&#13;
Administration. Agreement was reached with HPG during negotiationis that the project&#13;
accounts and the Special Accounts, including SOEs, would be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the&#13;
Bank for review within six months of the close of each fiscal year. In the case of the&#13;
SOEs, the audit report would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the&#13;
SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The&#13;
Bank Group currently accepts SAA audits for this purpose.&#13;
L. PROJECT SUPERVISION, REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.77  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose&#13;
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a&#13;
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is&#13;
presented in Annex 8. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at&#13;
headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,&#13;
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and&#13;
follow-up and review of the studies on highway safety and on organization, management&#13;
and maintenance of high-grade highways. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress&#13;
of implementation of all project components through quarterly progress reports to be&#13;
submitted to the Bank. In addition, WBFPO would submit to the Bank monthly reports&#13;
on the progress of implementation of the LSE and its linking roads, as well as the YBC.&#13;
A copy of each of the outline quarterly and monthly progress reports is available in the&#13;
Project File. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the project the total&#13;
time expended on supervision would be in the order of 60 person-weeks.&#13;
3.78  Monitoring and Reporting.  During implementation, project performance,&#13;
including the achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives&#13;
will be monitored by WBFPO through the use of performance indicators, reports on the&#13;
environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress reports and auditing of&#13;
project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be reviewed in an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report, to be submitted to the Bank not later than six months&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
after the loan closing date. Annex 9 presents the outline monitoring plan for the project.&#13;
The plan defines for each of the project components indices that will track annual&#13;
progress in attaining targets during implementation and impact objectives after the project&#13;
is completed. The plan specifies how, with what frequency and by whom, the data for the&#13;
indicators will be collected. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that.&#13;
(a)   Henan shall maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to&#13;
monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, the carrying out of the project and the&#13;
achievement of the objectives thereof&#13;
(b)   Henan shall prepare under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
furnish to the Bank a monthly report of the progress of works for LSE and&#13;
YBC.&#13;
(c)    Henan shall:&#13;
(i)   prepare under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and&#13;
furnish to the Bank a quarterly report, and by March 31 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1997 and ending three years after completion&#13;
of the project, an annual report, integrating the results of the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities performed pursuant to (a)&#13;
above, on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the project&#13;
during the period preceding the dates of such reports and setting&#13;
out the measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out&#13;
of the project and the achievement of the objectives thereof during&#13;
the periodfollowing such dates; and&#13;
(ii)   review with the Bank, by such subsequent dates as the Bank shall&#13;
request, the reports referred to above, and, thereafter, take all&#13;
measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the project&#13;
and the achievement of the objectives thereof, based on the&#13;
conclusions and recommendations of the said reports and the&#13;
Bank's views on the matter.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1   The economic evaluation includes assessments of four of the principal&#13;
components of the proposed project: (a) the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway, including&#13;
most of its linking roads; (b) the Guanyintang link road, which is not an essential&#13;
component of the Expressway itself; (c) the Yangjia-Baijiazhai connection between the&#13;
Weinan-Tongguan Expressway in Shaanxi Province and the existing Highway 310 in&#13;
Henan; and (d) the roads to be improved as part of RIPA component of the proposed&#13;
project. Each of the evaluated components has a positive net present value and an&#13;
economic rate of return in excess of the minimum acceptable. The revenue generating&#13;
components of the project are expected to be financially viable, and the sensitivity tests&#13;
all indicate that these conclusions are robust relative to the sensitivity tests carried out.&#13;
A. MAIN BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
4.2   The proposed Expressway would form part of the Lianyungang-Huoergousi&#13;
Trunk Highway, one of the four priority corridors planned as part of the NTHS. It would&#13;
eventually link the port of Lianyungang with the border of China and Kazakhstan, a&#13;
distance of just under 5,000 km. The principal objective of constructing the highway&#13;
would be to improve the accessibility of the inland provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi&#13;
and Henan to an efficient deep-water port and to the commercial centers of the coastal&#13;
provinces, as well as improving their land communication with Beijing. Once the&#13;
highway is completed, a high proportion of the benefits of the Luoyang-Sanrmenxia&#13;
section would accrue to through traffic between inland and coastal provinces. Through&#13;
traffic presently represents about 17 percent of traffic in the Luoyang-Sanmenxia&#13;
corridor.&#13;
4.3   At its eastern end, the Expressway will join with the Zhengzhou-Luoyang&#13;
Expressway (which was opened to traffic on December 28, 1995), while at the western&#13;
termination, it will join with the existing highway 310, which has been improved under&#13;
the Henan Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3531-CHA). Under the proposed Second&#13;
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, the Weinan-Tongguan (Henan/Shaanxi Border)&#13;
Expressway will be completed by the year 2000. When the three sections, together with&#13;
the link between Sanmenxia and the Tongguan-Weinan Expressway, are completed there&#13;
will be a high-grade road link of some 400 km between the provincial capitals of Henan&#13;
(Zhengzhou) and Shaanxi (Xian). Even while the corridor is being completed, a&#13;
relatively high proportion of the benefits of the Expressway will accrue to through traffic&#13;
between these capital cities and other industrial and commercial centers along the route.&#13;
4.4   The cities of Luoyang and Sanmenxia are already suffering the effects of traffic&#13;
congestion, even at the present relatively low levels of motorization. This congestion will&#13;
be relieved of the through traffic that would divert to the proposed Expressway and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
inter-urban traffic originating and terminating in the cities themselves. The light industry&#13;
and commercial activities of these two cities will also be principal beneficiaries of the&#13;
proposed Expressway, as it will be easier, faster and less costly for their products to gain&#13;
access to expanding regional markets. A revitalization of the Yumi coal field, just to the&#13;
north of the proposed Expressway, would also benefit from improved access.&#13;
4.5   The frequency of accidents and the number of fatalities and injuries on Henan's&#13;
highways and the existing Luoyang-Sanmenxia Highway is high by intemational&#13;
standards, partly a consequence of the high proportion of nonmotorized and&#13;
underpowered agricultural traffic not being segregated from motorized traffic. By&#13;
segregating a high proportion of the motorized traffic onto the proposed Expressway, the&#13;
nonmotorized traffic and pedestrians on the existing road will benefit through a greatly&#13;
reduced accident risk and less congested traffic conditions. Also because of its high&#13;
design standards, the LSE is inherently safer than the existing parallel highway.&#13;
4.6   The RIPA component of the project is designed specifically to benefit residents of&#13;
counties with average incomes below the poverty level. The project will benefit residents&#13;
through improved access to health, education and other social services as well as to&#13;
markets for the sale of their produce and commercial centers so that they can more easily&#13;
obtain food and other necessities.&#13;
4.7   The project is intended to encourage better highway management and&#13;
maintenance through institutional strengthening of various departments, institutes and&#13;
training schools of HPCD, the study of organization, management and maintenance of&#13;
high-grade highways and the provision of modem maintenance equipment. The road&#13;
safety program can be expected to result in a reduced number of accidents due to the&#13;
support it gives the Traffic Police and to the demonstration effect of the accident black&#13;
spot pilot program. The project also is intended to strengthen public works procurement&#13;
procedures and to upgrade management of construction entities. From these project&#13;
components, substantial (but unquantified) benefits are expected to accrue to&#13;
infrastructure users through better planned and maintained highways with associated&#13;
lower vehicle operating costs, and to Henan Province through more cost-effective use of&#13;
investment funds.&#13;
B. LUOYANG-SANMENXIA EXPRESSWAY&#13;
Traffic Levels and Projections&#13;
4.8   The existing highway between Luoyang and Sanmenxia is a Class II all-purpose&#13;
road without access control. Motorized traffic on the road has been increasing at more&#13;
than 15 percent per year since 1990, while nonmotorized traffic has been growing even&#13;
faster at almost 16 percent. When measured in vehicle equivalents, between 1 and&#13;
3 percent of the traffic on the road is nonmotorized but this comprises a large number of&#13;
bicycles and barrows that, together with pedestrians, are at high risk from the lack of&#13;
separate facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50-&#13;
4.9  In 1994, the existing highway carried about 7,000 medium-truck equivalents&#13;
(mte) throughout its length, and this had increased in April 1995 to over 9,000 mte at the&#13;
eastern end and to 7,200 mte closer to Sannenxia (Table 4.1). These traffic volumes are&#13;
close to the practical capacity of the road (about 7,000 mte). Even if the growth rate was&#13;
to fall to 10 percent per year, the projected traffic volume in the year 2000 (between&#13;
11,300 and 14,500 mte) would exceed the capacity of the existing road by more than&#13;
60 percent.&#13;
4.10  Projections of future traffic in the corridor have been made using a conventional&#13;
growth model, using a demand matrix of 35 traffic zones and with base-year interzonal&#13;
traffic flows based on an origin-destination survey carried out in April 1995, and&#13;
independent variables of population and economic growth. Two alternative projections&#13;
of future road transport demand have been made, each based on a different assumption of&#13;
economic growth in Luoyang, Sanmenxia and the remainder of Henan. The first is that&#13;
the economies will grow at about 9.7 percent per year until 2000, at about 8.5 percent&#13;
from 2000 to 2010 and 4.5 percent per year thereafter, whereas the second, less optimistic&#13;
projection, is for growth rates of about 7.8 percent, 7.0 percent and 3.5 percent&#13;
respectively. A regression analysis was used to derive a relationship between economic&#13;
growth and road transport demand and this indicated a demand elasticity of slightly more&#13;
than 1.1 for the projected levels of economic growth. Projections of vehicle numbers also&#13;
took account of a changing vehicle mix and a general increase in the capacity of freight&#13;
and passenger vehicles within each size category. All economic evaluations have been&#13;
based on the first of the two demand projections, with sensitivity tests being made with&#13;
the lower projection.&#13;
4.11  The proportion of traffic that is expected to use the new Expressway rather than&#13;
the present highway was estimated using a diversion equation that used generalized travel&#13;
cost as the independent variable, with the impact of tolls being determined separately.&#13;
The total projected traffic for the proposed Expressway also took account of traffic that&#13;
would be generated by the reduced travel times and costs that would be possible, and for&#13;
this purpose another elasticity of demand with respect to generalized transport cost was&#13;
developed. The generated traffic was projected to be about 10 percent of the corridor&#13;
total in 2000, reducing to 7 percent by the year 2020. Traffic that would be diverted from&#13;
the parallel railway was also estimated, but found to amount to less than 1 percent of the&#13;
total.&#13;
4.12  The projected traffic level on the new Expressway was estimated at between 7,700&#13;
and 12,900 mte in 2000 and at between 20,000 and 43,000 mte in 2020, with the&#13;
equivalent figures for the more optimistic projection being 7,900 and 19,400 mte in 2000&#13;
and at between 26,000 and 55,000 mte in the year 2020. These projections derive from&#13;
the application of the various demand and route assignment models at the level of&#13;
individual traffic zones and road links. By the year 2000, more than 26 percent of the&#13;
projected traffic on the Expressway would be through traffic, with both an origin and a&#13;
destination outside of the area of influence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
4.13  All the above projections assume that the Expressway would be operated as a toll&#13;
road, with a toll equivalent to Y 0.06 per ton-km until the year 2005, rising to Y 0.08 per&#13;
ton-km  by 2020.  The traffic projections for a situation without tolls were about&#13;
30 percent higher for the year 2000 and 10 percent higher in the year 2020. The reduced&#13;
incidence of tolls in the later years would arise because increased congestion costs on the&#13;
existing road would provide a greater incentive to use the new Expressway. The&#13;
projected traffic levels (measured in mte) on the four sections of the proposed&#13;
Expressway and its connecting roads at each end, for the situation with and without tolls,&#13;
in the years 2000 and 2020, are shown in Table 4.2&#13;
4.14  With tolls, the diversion rate to the new Expressway is projected to average&#13;
69 percent of the total corridor traffic in 2000 and to increase to 74 percent in 2020, as the&#13;
existing highway reaches its capacity. Without tolls, the equivalent figures are 83 percent&#13;
in both cases. These projected rates are considered reasonable and are compatible with&#13;
those observed on other toll roads in Henan Province. The Xinxiang-Zhengzhou section&#13;
of the Beijing-Zhuhai National Highway has maintained a diversion rate of more than&#13;
80 percent since 1990, while the Kaifeng-Zhengzhou section of the Lianyungang-&#13;
Huoergousi National Highway has achieved a diversion rate of more than 50 percent in&#13;
its first year, even though the existing road is not yet near capacity and coal trucks are not&#13;
allowed to use the highway.&#13;
Alternative Alignments and Cross Sections&#13;
4.15 Alignment. Alternative alignrnents were considered for four sections of the new&#13;
Expressway: The alternatives for each section were compared on the basis of costs&#13;
(construction, maintenance, operation), benefits, land acquisition and resettlement,&#13;
environmental factors, service to major traffic generators, relationships to existing and&#13;
future city plans. Also, the affected communities were involved in the formulation and&#13;
comparison of alternatives, as well as in the selection of the final alignments and number,&#13;
location and technical standards of interchanges, underpasses and grade separations.&#13;
Based on experience with completed and ongoing Bank-financed highway projects in&#13;
China, changes in locations as well as the number and size of underpasses are a main&#13;
source of delav during implementation. This was addressed by holding consultations&#13;
with villages and communities along LSE and YBC twice; once at the technoeconomic&#13;
feasibility study stage and the other at the detailed engineering design stage. Problem&#13;
locations involved additional consultations.&#13;
(a)   Luoyang to Xinan Section. An alternative to the north of the selected&#13;
alignment, slightly shorter (0.07 km) but closer for most trip origins and&#13;
destinations. It would also involve higher construction costs and result in&#13;
more resettlement of affected people.  This alternative was rejected&#13;
because the increase in construction costs is not justified by the small&#13;
increase in travel benefits;&#13;
(b)   Xinan to Yima Section. An alternative to the south of the selected&#13;
alignment, but 0.21 km shorter. It would pass slightly closer to trip origins&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
and destinations in Yima but would be more expensive to construct. This&#13;
alternative was also rejected because the increased construction costs&#13;
would have a greater impact than the increase in travel benefits;&#13;
(c)   Mianchi to Sanxian.  An alternative slightly north of the existing&#13;
alignment and passing close to the coal field at Yumi, with a route length&#13;
4.13 km shorter than the selected alignment. This alternative was subject&#13;
to considerable investigation because of its higher benefits to traffic&#13;
without a trip end in the Yumi area. It was rejected in order to avoid&#13;
archeological sites (para. 16 of Annex.5) and because of the high&#13;
probability of cost increases involved in constructing the Expressway&#13;
through an extensively mined area where the location of mine tunnels is&#13;
not known and because of the opportunity cost of the lost coal that could&#13;
not be mined if this alignment were selected;&#13;
(d)   Zhangmao to Xihezhuang. Although this alternative would also be&#13;
slightly shorter (0.15 km) than the recommended route, it would also&#13;
involve higher construction costs. All alignments in this area would&#13;
involve high costs, as the route must descend from 700 m to 500 m over a&#13;
short distance, while crossing a river and a railway and passing over&#13;
unstable geological structures in an area subject to earthquakes. The&#13;
alternative was rejected because the economic impact of the increase in&#13;
travel benefits was assessed to be less than that of the increase in&#13;
construction costs.&#13;
4.16 Cross-Section. A minimum of a four-lane divided highway with access control&#13;
would provide sufficient additional capacity to meet projected demand in the corridor.&#13;
The lower traffic projection also indicated demand in excess of the capacity of a two-lane&#13;
Auto Only highway. Since the high traffic projections show that the expressway would&#13;
be operating at close to its capacity before the end of the evaluation period, some account&#13;
was taken of the possibility of future expansion of the right-of-way width to&#13;
accommodate dual three-lanes. However, no allowance was made in the land acquisition&#13;
or civil works designs for this expansion, as it was considered to be too far into the future&#13;
and other alternative routes would need to be considered closer to the time the capacity&#13;
would be needed. The design of link roads and interchanges was determined on the basis&#13;
of the more optimistic traffic projection, and taking account of projections of local traffic&#13;
growth. Following a review of the traffic expected to access the Expressway at Luoyang,&#13;
the interchange location was revised, so that another interchange could be provided when&#13;
traffic reached an appropriate level.&#13;
4.17  The selection of a closed toll system was made to be compatible with other&#13;
expressways being constructed or planned in Henan and Shaanxi. Toll booths would be&#13;
provided at each of the access interchanges, and their number at the opening of the LSE&#13;
was planned to meet the more optimistic demand projection through the year 2010.&#13;
However, the area of the toll plazas would allow for an increase in the number of booths&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
if and when they should be needed. Toll levels were estimated taking account of the&#13;
revenue needed to maintain and operate the Expressway and service the Bank loan for its&#13;
construction, as well as compatibility with other tolled highways in Henan province and&#13;
an objective of constraining the reduction of traffic diverted to the proposed Expressway&#13;
because of the imposition of the toll, to less than 10 percent in the long term.&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
4.18 Method. Economic evaluation of the LSE was undertaken by HPCD's Planning&#13;
Survey and Design Institute, using the standard methodology of the Ministry of&#13;
Communications, but adapted to meet Bank standards and requirements. The evaluation&#13;
was based on assessment of the economic cost of construction and maintenance,&#13;
compared with the traffic benefits of lower vehicle operating costs and time savings&#13;
through higher speeds. Accident benefits were included in the evaluation, but using&#13;
average accident rates for all roads in each class in Henan province, rather than those for&#13;
the present highway. All costs and benefits were expressed in December 1995 values, net&#13;
of taxes, subsidies and price contingencies, and adjusted to reflect opportunity costs of&#13;
resources. Separate evaluations were made for four parts of the Expressway, Luoyang-&#13;
Xinan, Xinan-Mianchi, Mianchi-Guanyintang, and Guanyintang-Sanmenxia. Most of the&#13;
link roads were considered an integral part of the Expressway with the costs and benefits&#13;
being included in the basic evaluation, but the link to Guanyintang was evaluated&#13;
separately.&#13;
4.19  Construction costs were estimated using the standard MOC methodology, which&#13;
relies on frequent market surveys to determine unit prices, which are applied to bills of&#13;
quantities derived from the engineering drawings. Factors for converting financial to&#13;
economic prices are based on comparing financial unit costs with border prices plus&#13;
transport costs. Labor cost shadow prices were not applied.&#13;
4.20  For evaluation purposes, the LSE was assumed to be constructed in 4.5 years,&#13;
opening to traffic in 2000. The economic life of the highway was assumed to be 20&#13;
years.  In addition to the cost of construction, the costs of periodic maintenance&#13;
(pavement overlays) every seven years were taken into consideration. Annual costs of&#13;
routine highway maintenance and toll operations have also been included. The residual&#13;
value of each highway section at the end of the evaluation period was assumed to be&#13;
50 percent of the initial construction cost.&#13;
4.21  User benefits were calculated separately for traffic that would continue to use the&#13;
existing highway, traffic that would divert to the new Expressway and generated traffic.&#13;
Sensitivity tests were made using the more optimistic traffic projection, excluding&#13;
accident benefits, with reduced values of time savings, without tolls and with costs and&#13;
benefits varying between 60 and 140 percent of those of the base evaluation. The latter&#13;
was used to determine the range of values for which the project would remain&#13;
economically viable, so that an assessment could be made of the probability of&#13;
occurrence of these values.  An evaluation of alternative opening years for the&#13;
Expressway was also made, which showed that the earliest possible opening date would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
maximize the net benefit of the project. Table 4.4 shows the base evaluation results&#13;
together with the sensitivity results in respect of traffic levels, accidents and tolls, while&#13;
Table 4.5 shows the range of costs and benefits for which the project remains viable.&#13;
4.22  The economic evaluation provides estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the&#13;
project and its economic internal rate of return (EIRR). To help in an assessment of the&#13;
financial viability of the project from the point of view of Henan Province, a financial&#13;
evaluation was also made to estimate the project's cash flow and financial rate of return.&#13;
4.23   Results. The basic evaluation of the LSE as a whole and by section indicates that&#13;
the selected alignment is economically viable, and the sensitivity tests with respect to&#13;
transport demand, absence of tolls, a zero value of time and excluding accident benefits&#13;
maintain this position. The base case evaluation for the whole route, as shown in Table&#13;
4.4, indicates an EIRR of 19.0 percent, while the evaluation by route section shows the&#13;
highest value (19.3 percent) for the section between Luoyang and Xinan and the lowest&#13;
value (18.3 percent) for the section between Xinan and Mianchi. The first of these road&#13;
sections has the lowest unit construction cost, while the second has a number of&#13;
expensive civil works which give it the highest unit construction cost. In addition, while&#13;
the first section has the highest traffic level in the early years of the project, contributing&#13;
to its rather better economic justification, the second section has the highest traffic in the&#13;
later years, but this is insufficient to offset the higher construction cost. Although the&#13;
sections have been evaluated separately and all found to have acceptable EIRR values,&#13;
the route should be considered as a whole as it is designed to deal with a problem of&#13;
through traffic for the whole region and to provide improved access for the provinces&#13;
which are further inland.&#13;
4.24 As would be expected, assuming an absence of tolls would result in improved&#13;
economic assessments of 21.6 percent, while eliminating the benefits of time savings&#13;
from the calculation of EIRR reduces the worth of the project, while still providing an&#13;
acceptable result of 16.1 percent.&#13;
4.25  The analysis of the optimum year for opening of the road showed that delaying&#13;
the construction for even one year would reduce the economic viability (analyzed by the&#13;
NPV) of the project, and that the reduction would increase with further delays.&#13;
4.26  The sensitivity of the evaluation results to variations in the costs and benefits of&#13;
the project indicate that the conditions for the project's viability to fall below the&#13;
minimum acceptable, that is, an NPV of less than zero or an EIRR of less than 12 percent,&#13;
are unlikely to occur. The benefits would have to fall to less than 50 percent of those in&#13;
the base case with no change in costs, the costs would have to increase to more than&#13;
50 percent of those of the base case, or the costs would have to rise by 30 percent and the&#13;
benefits fall by 30 percent at the same time. The unacceptable results are those shown as&#13;
shaded in Table 4.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Financial Evaluation&#13;
4.27  Two financial evaluations were made. The first was to determine the rate of&#13;
return on equity from the point of view of the Highway Agency and Central Government.&#13;
For this evaluation, the equity of project was taken to be the total investment cost less the&#13;
debt, the loan from the Bank for the project. The net revenues were determined by&#13;
subtracting the loan servicing costs and road operating and maintenance costs from the&#13;
total toll revenue. The return on equity was calculated as the net present value of net&#13;
revenues expressed as a percentage of the project equity. The second evaluation was of&#13;
the cash flow of the project, to determine the net present value of cash flows and the&#13;
financial rate of return.&#13;
4.28  The financial evaluation (Table 4.6) shows that with the medium  traffic&#13;
projection, the return on equity would be almost 15 percent and the net cash flow would&#13;
be positive. However, both these results are very sensitive to the level of toll revenues&#13;
and the costs of the project. The greatest risk on toll revenue is that during the first five&#13;
years or so, the diversion from the existing road will not reach the equilibrium level&#13;
projected.  If this should happen, the return on equity would reduce to just over&#13;
10 percent and the net cash flow would be negative. Similarly, if the total construction&#13;
cost of the project should increase by 25 percent, the equity would increase by 43 percent&#13;
as the debt could not be increased, and the rate of return on equity would fall to a similar&#13;
level as with the revenue reduction, just over 10 percent. The net cash flow would also&#13;
be negative. These results indicate the importance from a financial point of view of&#13;
controlling the costs of construction and of maximizing the project's revenues,&#13;
particularly in the opening years.&#13;
C. GUANYINTANG INTERCHANGE AND LINKING ROAD&#13;
4.29  The Guanyintang link of 3.2 km would provide access to the Expressway for&#13;
trucks from the Yumi coal field, particularly the Guanyintang, Ganhao and Zhijian coal&#13;
mines, as well as to the town of Guanyintang. The present Class IV road carries only&#13;
local traffic of about 250 mte per day. If the connection is not built, traffic from the three&#13;
localities would have the possibility of using the Mianchi interchange, about 12 km west&#13;
of Guanyintang, or the Sanmenxia interchange, about 26 km east of Guanyintang. About&#13;
75 percent of the traffic that would use the interchange would have an origin or&#13;
destination to the east. The interchange would be a simple design, similar to the other&#13;
intermediate intersections on the Expressway, and the link road would be built to Class II&#13;
standards. The cost of the road would be just under $2.0 million and the estimated net&#13;
present value is $0.8 million and the EIRR 16 percent. These results were found to be&#13;
robust in that the values exceeded the acceptable minimum, for the same sensitivity tests&#13;
as were carried out for the Expressway.&#13;
D. YANGJIA-BAIJIAZHAI CONNECTION (YBC)&#13;
4.30  This connecting road would be a separate part of the project and would not be&#13;
linked directly to the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway, but would link the part of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
National Highway 310 that joins the Expressway at Sanmenxia with the Weinan-&#13;
Tongguan Expressway to be constructed as part of the Second Shaanxi Provincial&#13;
Highway Project.  Construction of this connecting road would be necessary for&#13;
realization of the full benefits of the Weinan- Tongguan Expressway.&#13;
4.31  An evaluation of the YBC has been made from the point of view of Henan&#13;
Province, taking account only of the benefits to traffic on the connecting road itself. The&#13;
evaluation also took account of different standards of provision of the connecting road,&#13;
since it would connect a four-lane divided highway in Shaanxi with a two-lane, two-way&#13;
highway in Henan, at least until the Henan section of National Highway 310 was&#13;
upgraded to Expressway standard, expected to be about the year 2010. The method of&#13;
analysis and derivation of input parameters to the evaluation were the same as for the&#13;
Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway.&#13;
4.32  The traffic volume between the two roads to be joined by the YBC is projected to&#13;
be about 5,700 mte/day in 2000, the opening year, increasing to 19,500 by 2020. The&#13;
results of the economic evaluation indicate that the best way to construct the YBC for&#13;
these volumes of traffic would be the staged construction of a four-lane Expressway, with&#13;
the first stage being a two-lane Expressway, built to the design standards appropriate to a&#13;
half section of a four-lane Expressway. This preferred construction phasing gives an&#13;
EIRR of 13.4 percent, whereas constructing to a full four-lane standard from the opening&#13;
date gives an estimated EIRR of only 9.6 percent. However, since both results only take&#13;
account of the benefits to traffic on the YBC itself, and there are large additional benefits&#13;
to the same traffic when it is on the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway, it should be&#13;
remembered that they significantly underestimate the full economic benefit of the road.&#13;
The additional benefits in the WTE would be the same for either method of constructing&#13;
the connecting road, so do not influence the preferred construction phasing.&#13;
E. EVALUATION OF RIPA COMPONENT&#13;
4.33  The RIPA component of the project is aimed at rehabilitating and upgrading&#13;
basic-access roads in low-income counties of the province, with a view to increasing&#13;
accessibility to basic health, social and education services as well as to markets to&#13;
increase the social sustainability of these areas. It is expected that in the long term, the&#13;
program will stimulate increased economic activity and employment and significantly&#13;
contribute to a reduction of rural poverty.&#13;
4.34  The nature of the expected benefits of the component precludes many of them&#13;
from a quantified analysis, and many others can only be estimated approximately, so the&#13;
expressed economic rates of return must be considered as minimal and as representing&#13;
only part of the value of this project component. For the first year subprojects of this&#13;
component, the quantified benefits include only reductions in vehicle operating costs,&#13;
reduced accident costs, and time savings to vehicle occupants. Unquantified benefits&#13;
include improved health, higher education achievement, increased social relations, and&#13;
increased output and incomes.  For second and subsequent year subprojects, the&#13;
quantified benefits will take account of generated trips for health, social, education,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
employment and commercial purposes. The total population that will benefit from this&#13;
component is the total population in the area of influence of the proposed highway&#13;
systems in the selected counties with a low income. The counties for inclusion in the&#13;
subproject were selected using a mix of economic and social indicators. A total of eight&#13;
road systems with a length of 662 km were chosen for rehabilitation, upgrading or new&#13;
construction in the first year's package. The total number of people who are expected to&#13;
benefit from this package is about 1.2 million. Only those components identified for&#13;
inclusion in the first year of the project have been evaluated. The estimated economic&#13;
rate of return for these eight systems varied from 14.2 to 31.6 percent with an average of&#13;
19.6 percent (Table 4.7).&#13;
F. EVALUATION OF RISKS&#13;
4.35   The principal risks that the net benefits from the project might not be realized&#13;
arise from two factors relating to the construction cost and three to the traffic benefits.&#13;
The road is to be constructed mostly on embankment and has an unusually high number&#13;
of large structures. There is some risk that attempts to build the road too quickly will&#13;
result in an inadequate compaction of the earthworks for the high embankments, with a&#13;
risk of further settlement after the road is open and a need for an earlier than planned&#13;
reconstruction. To some extent this risk will be mitigated by providing only a light&#13;
pavement in the initial construction on the sections with high embankments and those&#13;
built on soft soils, so that any additional cost from reconstruction will be minimized. The&#13;
full strength pavement will be added as an overlay after a few years of operation of the&#13;
road when no further sign of settlement is seen. The large and relatively difficult&#13;
structures, long and high bridges, in some cases to built at difficult angles to the natural&#13;
features of the terrain, will require careful supervision of construction if later expensive&#13;
remedial works are to be avoided.&#13;
4.36   This risk has already been reduced by making major modifications to the&#13;
alignment that have reduced the need for large structures and the associated risk of cost&#13;
overruns or need for remedial work. The possibility of a cost increase was evaluated as a&#13;
sensitivity test, which showed that an increase of more than 50 percent would be needed&#13;
before the EIRR becomes unacceptable level. It is considered that the risk of this degree&#13;
of cost overrun is unlikely, given previous experience with Expressway construction in&#13;
Henan province and the stringent supervision methods agreed with the provincial&#13;
government, which will involve higher-than-usual foreign expert participation and&#13;
responsibility for the quality of the works (rather than an advisory role as in previous&#13;
projects). The provincial government of Henan has demonstrated its ability and capacity&#13;
to manage large road projects, which when taken together with the additional supervision&#13;
measures to be taken, significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns.&#13;
4.37  The traffic benefit risks relate to projected traffic growth and diversion of traffic&#13;
to the new Expressway. The projection of traffic was made on the assumption of a&#13;
continued strong growth of the local economy and there is a possibility that this will not&#13;
occur. However, the consequences of providing capacity in advance of its need is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
considered a more acceptable and less costly risk than that that of not providing capacity&#13;
when it is needed. The assessment of the optimum opening date indicates a significant&#13;
reduction in project benefits if congestion is allowed to increase before the road is open, a&#13;
consequence similar to that of a higher than planned growth of traffic occurring.&#13;
Experience with earlier highway projects in China revealed the high costs of providing&#13;
too little capacity or providing it too late, while a review of a recent project has indicated&#13;
the lesser costs of overprojecting traffic. Providing too little capacity has consequences&#13;
that affect the daily lives of all who use the existing road or depend on the services that it&#13;
provides, whereas the consequences of providing capacity too soon are only financial,&#13;
and road users in any case receive the benefits of a new road.&#13;
4.38   There is a further risk that the volume of traffic that will divert to the new road&#13;
will be less than that estimated. There is only a short history of the operation of toll roads&#13;
in China on which to build expectations of how users will react to the imposition of tolls.&#13;
The diversion rate to the new road once the existing road is operating at capacity is not so&#13;
questionable, as the only alternative to suffering congestion on the old road or not making&#13;
the trip, is to use the new road. So the period of doubt about for considering diversion to&#13;
the new road is that until traffic on the existing road is building up to its capacity limit.&#13;
Experience with other tolls roads in China and elsewhere is that the diversion to a new&#13;
tolled road can take up to four or five years to build up to the estimated level. This is&#13;
probably because of the time needed for road users to become aware of the potential&#13;
benefits of using the new road and to change their travel behavior to take the new road&#13;
into account.&#13;
4.39   When the existing road is already nearing congestion, as in this case, the time for&#13;
the diversion rate to reach its estimated level will probably be shorter than the average. If&#13;
the diversion rate starts at 50 percent and increases to the estimated 67 percent over three&#13;
years, the net present value of benefits will be reduced by about 20 percent, and as shown&#13;
in Table 4.5, this would have to be combined with a cost overrun of 40 percent or more&#13;
for it to result in an unacceptable outcome. Additional measures that can be taken to&#13;
encourage a rapid buildup to the estimated diversion rate include giving a toll-free period&#13;
at the opening of the road so that users can quickly become aware of its advantages, and&#13;
providing other incentives for using the road (many of which would be innovative in the&#13;
context of China, but which are used elsewhere, such as free accident insurance,&#13;
provision of food and mechanical repair facilities at the access toll stations, prizes for&#13;
"lucky" toll ticket numbers, etc.).&#13;
Risk and Actions&#13;
4.40  Based on experience with the ongoing highway projects, potential risks center on&#13;
delays in implementation, particularly for the LSE due to the difficulty of construction,&#13;
especially of bridges caused by the rugged topography and limited space in some areas;&#13;
design changes, the long time required to handle variation orders during construction as&#13;
well as the late start in the traffic engineering component; objections raised by people&#13;
living along the right-of-way caused by insufficient consultation, and unexpected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
archeological finds. However, preparation of this project has benefited significantly from&#13;
the Bank's experience in similar highway projects in China, as well as from the active&#13;
involvement of MOC and the review of the design and bid documents for the LSE by&#13;
qualified international experts.  Moreover, the design of the traffic engineering&#13;
component has already started and more attention is being given to the resettlement and&#13;
land acquisition problem, including more consultation with the local people affected by&#13;
the LSE. Extensive archeological surveys were conducted to reduce the probability of&#13;
unexpected finds. Also, the relatively large value of contracts (average of $40 million)&#13;
for construction of the LSE and the possibility to bid on two or more contracts at the&#13;
same time would attract the larger and more capable contractors and would ensure&#13;
successful completion with little or no delays.&#13;
4.41  According to the project financing plan, Henan Province would have to contribute&#13;
$291 million or 48 percent of the total cost. This is a large amount, and considering the&#13;
investment requirements of other projects in Henan Province, the timely availability of&#13;
counterpart local funds in the proper amounts could delay completion of the project as&#13;
well as its total cost. However, based on experience with the two ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
highway projects in Henan, this has not been a major problem.&#13;
4.42  Uneven and sometimes substandard quality of works as well as cost overruns are&#13;
another risk that should be addressed. This problem is generally caused by laxity of&#13;
construction. For the first time in the highway sector in China a joint venture between&#13;
international and local firms/entities, where the international experts are not only advisors&#13;
but executors responsible for the quality of the works, will be in charge of construction&#13;
supervision.&#13;
4.43  Sustainability. In view of the relatively fast expansion of the NTHS and other&#13;
high-grade highways and their related high construction costs, there is growing danger&#13;
that not enough resources will be devoted to the maintenance of nonhigh-grade highways,&#13;
including roads contained in the RIPA component under the project. As pointed out in&#13;
para. 2.35, HPCD has agreed to allocate sufficient resources to highway maintenance&#13;
during the 9FYP and continue to monitor the condition of existing roads. The proposed&#13;
project includes a study of organization, management and maintenance of the LSE and&#13;
other high-grade highways in Henan Province, training of staff in highway maintenance,&#13;
and provision of equipment for highway maintenance.&#13;
4.44  Recent experience suggests that once the high-grade highways are in operation,&#13;
operational and safety risks will need to be addressed. The traffic component of the&#13;
project will be reviewed by qualified technical experts. Also, the proposed project&#13;
includes a study of the operation anid maintenance of the LSE as well as equipment and&#13;
training of staff for its operation and maintenance.&#13;
4.45  The success of the highway safety component also depends on good cooperation&#13;
between HPCD and the Traffic Police, which has in the past been difficult. However,&#13;
under the proposed project a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination was created,&#13;
and consideration is being given to holding a highway safety seminar in China in 1997 to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
help raise awareness of the safety problem and to increase the level of support at various&#13;
governmental levels to this very important issue. This seminar could be followed by a&#13;
similar one at the provincial level (in 1998). However, the possibility of holding a small&#13;
workshop on safety in 1997 to initiate planning of the provincial seminar would be&#13;
explored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1   Agreement was reached with the Central Government at negotiations that it would&#13;

- 63 -&#13;
for the structure of toll rates on the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway,&#13;
taking into consideration the results of the recent studies on toll rates&#13;
conducted under other Bank-financed highway projects in China and the&#13;
experience with toll rates on major roads in Henan Province and other&#13;
parts of China (para. 3.62);&#13;
(m)   the project accounts and the Special Accounts, including SOEs, would be&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit&#13;
reports would be sent to the Bank for review within six months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year (para. 3.76); and&#13;
(n)   (i) Henan shall maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to&#13;

1.    A three-stage screening process was agreed: (a) an initial screening, designed to&#13;
select "priority counties," counties whose composite ranking on selected demographic,&#13;
economic and social criteria, identifies them as the most in need of improved road&#13;
transport as an element in alleviating their "poverty" situation; (b) a second screening&#13;
focusing on the cost effectiveness of each roads improvement system per population&#13;
served; and (c) a detailed economic and social analysis of those RIPA systems that&#13;
successfully meet the criteria of the first two screening procedures.&#13;
First-Stage Screening&#13;
2.    Identification and Definition of Poor Counties. In 1993, the Henan Provincial&#13;
Government (HPG) used the following criteria for defining poor counties: (a) counties&#13;
that received poverty alleviation funds from SPC and HPG during 1986-93, and whose&#13;
per capita annual income in 1993 was &lt;Y 600; (b) the counties that were defined as poor&#13;
by HPG in 1986 and in 1993, if their income was SY 450. Twenty-eight of the Henan&#13;
counties have been identified by SPC as the Poor counties. An additional six counties, with&#13;
a poverty line at &lt;Y 450 per capita/year, have been identified by Henan Province. Of a total&#13;
poor population of 7.6 million, 68 percent (approximately 5.2 million) live in these 34&#13;
counties and their 279 townships. The remaining 2.4 million poor people (32 percent of the&#13;
total) live in another 195 townships outside of the designated poor counties.&#13;
3.    Ranking and Selection of Poor Counties for RIPA. Henan's counties were&#13;
ranked according to a composite score taking into account the following indicators:&#13;
(a)   Income Ranking: to assess the extent of poverty; this ranking is based on&#13;
the counties' average per capita income, and the counties with the lowest&#13;
incomes were ranked the highest for RIPA selection. The average per&#13;
capita income in 1993 varied from Y 200 to Y 450, and was allocated 5&#13;
points in the ranking system. Counties with the lowest incomes were&#13;
given the highest ranking. The counties with per capita average incomes&#13;
of Y 200-249 were given 5 points, Y 250-299 with 4 points, Y 300-349&#13;
with 3 points, Y 350-399 with 2 points and Y 2400 with only I point.&#13;
(b)   Poverty Ranking: This indicator is intended to identify the "very poor"&#13;
counties, those with an annual per capita income &lt;Y 300. The number of&#13;
the very poor as a percent of the total county population was used to&#13;
determine the index of poverty ranking. This index varied from 20 percent&#13;
to 59 percent, and was allocated 5 points. The counties with the highest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
percentage of the very poor were given the highest rank. The counties&#13;
with the very poor population being 50 to 59 percent were given 5 points,&#13;
40 to 49 percent with 4 points, 30 to 39 percent with 3 points, 20 to&#13;
29 percent with 2 points and less than 20 percent given 1 point.&#13;
(c)   Value of Agricultural Production:   was measured through the&#13;
importance of agriculture andforestry as the economic base and source of&#13;
income. Total land area in agriculture and forestry as a percentage of total&#13;
county land area was used as a surrogate index and was allocated 5 points.&#13;
This varied from 30 percent to 70 percent. When this index was in the&#13;
highest range of 60 to 70 percent, 5 points were allocated, 4 points for 50&#13;
to 59 percent, 3 points for 40 to 49 percent, 2 points for 30 to 39 percent&#13;
and 1 point for less than 30 percent;&#13;
(d)   Value of Mineral Production:  in 1993 was another indicator with&#13;
S maximum points and varied from Y 2 million to Y 130 million. When&#13;
the value of annual mineral production was &gt;Y 100 million, that county&#13;
was given 5 points, Y 70-100 million 4 points, Y 40-70 million 3 points,&#13;
Y 10-40 million with 2 points and &lt;Y 100 million with I point. As&#13;
inaccessibility increases transport cost of mineral resources and hinders&#13;
their exploitation, mineral resources potential offers a good measure of&#13;
the potential benefits of improved transport. Counties with higher value of&#13;
mineral production were scored higher on that basis; and&#13;
(e)   Social Development Indicators: based on 1993 data, were allocated&#13;
5 points as follows: (i) population without clean drinking water varied&#13;
from  5 to 77 percent of total county population.  When this was&#13;
&gt;=41 percent, that county was allocated 1 point. Other counties were&#13;
allocated zero points; (ii) the number of health workers per 10,000&#13;
persons was used as an indicator of access to health services and was&#13;
allocated 1 point. It varied from 12 to 40. Counties with lower access&#13;
(S25 health workers per 10,000 persons) were given 1 point. All other&#13;
counties with higher degree of health access were given zero points;&#13;
(iii) percent of people who cannot read or write (number of persons per&#13;
10,000 population) was used as an educational indicator. This varied from&#13;
0.29 to 15.33. Counties with the higher illiteracy (27.7 persons per 10,000&#13;
population) were allocated 1 point. All other counties with higher literacy&#13;
were allocated zero points; (iv) Food for Work Program (FWP)&#13;
expenditures in each county varied from zero to Y 1.2 million per year.&#13;
They were used as a surrogate to unemployment and were allocated&#13;
2 points.  Counties in the bottom one-third range of FWP annual&#13;
expenditures (&lt;Y 400,000) were given zero points, middle-third range&#13;
(Y 400,000-800,000) with I point and the top-third range (&gt;Y 800,000)&#13;
given 2 points.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
4.    On the basis of the above, the ranking of 34 poor counties varied from a low of 7 to&#13;
a high of 20, out of maximum possible rank of 25 (the higher the score the more is the&#13;
county in need of road improvements). Twenty-one counties had a ranking of &gt;10 and all&#13;
of these were included in RIPA.. In the 34 poor counties, 26 administrative townships&#13;
currently have only seasonal roads. These townships are in mountainous areas: Dabai&#13;
mountains, Tong Bai mountains, Fu Niu mountains, and Xiao Han mountains. Some of&#13;
these townships are in four counties with ratings of &lt;10 (Xi Chuan, Xin Xian, Shang&#13;
Cheng, and Gushi). However, the highest priority of RIPA is to provide all-weather access&#13;
to these townships and therefore, it was agreed during preparation to include these four&#13;
counties in RIPA.&#13;
5.   It was also agreed to include Xin Yang county (rating of 9) and Luo Shan county&#13;
(rating of 10) within RIPA because of the importance of efficiently connecting the "poor&#13;
county" road systems to the National Railway Network. Another important priority is&#13;
proper all-weather connectivity between counties themselves. Considering this, Bei Yang&#13;
county was included (rating of 9).  The Nanjing-Xian Railway is currently under&#13;
construction and is to be completed in 1998-99. It was considered important to connect the&#13;
two poor counties of Luan Chuan and Lushi to this railway in Xi Xia county, even though&#13;
Xi Xia is not one of the poor counties. Based upon these considerations, 28 of the 34 poor&#13;
counties are included in the first screening of RIPA. In addition, Xi Xia , which is not a&#13;
poor county, will be included in RIPA. This makes the total number of counties selected&#13;
for inclusion in the Bank-financed component of RIPA to be 29.&#13;
Second Stage Screening of Poor Counties&#13;
6.    The purpose of the second screening was to select an initial basket of road systems&#13;
from which a RIPA component for the Project could be identified. The criteria below were&#13;
applied to the full basket of road segments proposed by Henan Province for the counties&#13;
selected in the first screening stage. It was agreed that these criteria would be used in&#13;
descending order of priority:&#13;
- Upgrade seasonal roads to all-weather unclassified roads, including&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of culverts and bridges as necessary;&#13;
. Build new all-weather roads to those townships that do not have any road&#13;
connections;&#13;
* Upgrade unclassified roads to Class IV roads;&#13;
* Build new Class IV roads; and&#13;
* Rehabilitate and or build short critical sections of Class III roads.&#13;
As a result, the initial RIPA basket covers 29 counties with 40 highway systems (consisting&#13;
of 98 segments) totaling 2,291 km, with an estimated total cost of Y 839 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
Initial Basket of RIPA Road Systems&#13;
7.    The road segments in the poorest counties, which are to be constructed and&#13;
rehabilitated as part of Henan's Provincial RIPA program, is described in Table 1 below.&#13;
Over 88 percent of the total cost of these roads are for Class IV and Unclassified road&#13;
segments.&#13;

Screening of RIPA Initial Basket for Implementation&#13;
8.    The System Cost Ratio (SCR) or the cost of each system divided by the population&#13;
in the influence area, was used for screening the initial RIPA systems basket. Based on this&#13;
criterion, the most cost-effective systems would have the highest priority for&#13;
implementation. However, it was recognized that simple cost factors build inequity,&#13;
especially when costs are higher and population densities are lower in mountainous areas,&#13;
when compared to lower road construction costs in rolling or flat terrain. Therefore, it was&#13;
agreed that the SCR for systems in mountainous areas would be adjusted by a cost factor of&#13;
0.66 (SCR will be multiplied by 0.66). It was also agreed that the Class III roads included&#13;
in RIPA will not be subject to the SCR screening as their economic intemal rate of return&#13;
(EIRR) will have to be equal or &gt;12 percent. Where a system consists of Class III and&#13;
lower class roads, HPCD can, for the purposes of the feasibility analysis, use the combined&#13;
system (Class III and access roads ) or separate the Class III road as a system by itself.&#13;
However, if the Class III roads are combined with the access roads for analysis, then the&#13;
EIRR must be that for Class III roads (i.e., = or &gt;12 percent ). If they are analyzed&#13;
separately, then the EIRR will vary according to their classification.&#13;
RIPA Implementation Basket&#13;
9.    Based upon above considerations and subject to a total budget of Y 650 million&#13;
(Y 583 million without contingencies), the RIPA Implementation Basket was developed by&#13;
HPCD and reviewed by the Bank. This implementation basket includes the road systems&#13;
that will be subject to the Third-Stage economic and social analysis, and to the required&#13;
minimum EIRR (para. 12 of this Annex).&#13;

RIPA Implementation Plan under the Project&#13;
10.   Based upon the preceding considerations, and the practicality of implementation, a&#13;
plan for the execution of RIPA systems financed under the proposed project, was developed&#13;
by HPCD and reviewed by the Bank. This plan is shown as Table 3.&#13;

Third-Stage Screening of RIPA Systems&#13;
11.   The third-stage screening consists of an analysis of the economic and social benefits&#13;
of each of the roads systems proposed for consideration in the RIPA Implementation Plan at&#13;
the end of the Second-Stage screening. The following criteria were used in this stage:&#13;
Analysis as Groups of Small Systems. The road segments were analyzed as&#13;
groups of small systems rather than on a segment by segment basis. RIPA&#13;
roads need not be paved roads but must provide all-weather access, and thus&#13;
the proposed systems include "unclassified Nonmotorized Transport (NMT)"&#13;
(e.g., bicycles, animal-drawn carts, tractors, and jeeps) roads, "unclassified"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92 -                      ANNEX I&#13;
all-weather roads, i.e., below "Class IV," and "classified roads-Class IV and&#13;
Class III."&#13;
*  Use of Motorization Data to Identify NMT Requirements. Data on the&#13;
number of motor vehicles (in different classifications such as cars, trucks,&#13;
motorcycles, tractors ) in the counties to be connected by the proposed RIPA&#13;
systems is required for this analysis. This information was reviewed in the&#13;
context of recent high growth of motorization. The primary purpose of the&#13;
review was to confirm that the type of road systems proposed (classified,&#13;
motorized, nonmotorized) fits with the trends in the motor vehicle population&#13;
and their use.&#13;
*  Variations in Expected Minimum  Economic Internal Rate of Return&#13;
(EIRR). This depends upon the types of roads within each proposed system.&#13;
The system classification for analysis of EIRR is based upon the dominant&#13;
class of road within the system.  For example, if the dominant part&#13;
(&gt;50 percent of length in km) is unclassified, then the EIRR expected is that&#13;
for unclassified roads (both new and rehabilitated). If the dominant part of the&#13;
system is Class IV, the expected EIRR is that for the Class IV roads (new,&#13;
upgraded and rehabilitated).&#13;
12.   The expected EIRR varies as follows:&#13;
(a)   Unclassified Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR of 8-10 percent.&#13;
(i)    All new roads for Nonmotorized Transport (bicycles and animal&#13;
carts) and farmers' vehicles (tractors and jeeps) that may not&#13;
necessarily be designed for trucks but primarily to provide access&#13;
to farmers and their local economic activities; and&#13;
(ii)    New and rehabilitated all- weather unclassified roads.&#13;
The expected EIRR for primary access roads (unclassified roads) is lower&#13;
than the other classes of roads. Therefore, the EIRR, in this case, must be&#13;
supported by higher social benefits (population getting new access,&#13;
population getting better access and improvement in the social indicators&#13;
included in the county ranking system (outlined below).&#13;
(b)   Class IV Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 10-12 percent&#13;
These roads include upgrading of unclassified roads to Class IV,&#13;
rehabilitation of existing Class IV roads, and new Class IV roads. If the&#13;
EIRR is low, then social benefits (as discussed below) should be high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
(c)   Class III Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 12 percent&#13;
These roads include new and rehabilitated Class III roads, and roads&#13;
upgraded from Unclassified or Class IV to Class IlI.&#13;
13.   Social benefits are defined as increases in access to health services (clinics and&#13;
hospitals), availability of potable water, access to educational services (reduced&#13;
educational dropout rates and adult literacy) and improved access to employment&#13;
(reduced dependence on FWP expenditures). These rates were not calculated for the first-&#13;
year package, but for subsequent years will be calculated by extrapolation with the&#13;
existing situation in nearby comparator counties with greater access to roads. The&#13;
proportion of the total population getting new and better all-weather access (through&#13;
improved connectivity and reduction of travel time and cost) will also stand as an&#13;
indicator of social benefits. These social benefits will be calculated for each subsequent&#13;
RIPA system to be evaluated prior to its inclusion into an implementation package for&#13;
Bank approval.&#13;
14.   As influence areas and beneficiary populations change over time, the system cost&#13;
ratio, SCR (cost of the proposed system per person in the influence area, adjusted for&#13;
mountain terrain) might change accordingly. In order for such systems to continue to be&#13;
included in the RIPA Implementation plan, the SCR should be &lt;Y 189. If the SCR is&#13;
&gt;Y 189, HPCD can further amend the system or delete it from implementation altogether.&#13;
In the event of a system being so deleted, then HPCD must select the next most cost-&#13;
effective system from the list of systems agreed upon with the Bank. However, the systems&#13;
to be added (chosen initially on the basis of lowest SCR) will also be subjected to social and&#13;
economic analysis and must meet the agreed upon EIRR criteria.&#13;
15.   Should any of the systems still not yield the required EIRR, it was agreed that:&#13;
(a) for all Class III roads, HPCD can either amend the proposed system or delete the&#13;
systems and substitute it by either Class III or lower class road systems; these new systems&#13;
must be economically feasible and must meet the EIRR considerations; (b) for all Class IV&#13;
and Unclassified roads, HPCD must use the list of priorities based upon modified SCR as&#13;
discussed in this Annex.&#13;
16.   HPCD will conduct a feasibility analysis for each of the subsequent systems before&#13;
inclusion in packages for Bank approval. HPCD will send to the Bank documentation as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   For the second package of RIPA systems:&#13;
(i)   one selected feasibility analysis;&#13;
(ii)    a summary of feasibility analyses for all the systems in this package.&#13;

ANNEX 2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDY OF&#13;
ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF&#13;
TOLL HIGHWAYS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Bank's experience worldwide, including China, has shown that the&#13;
establishment of toll road corporations often comes late in the period of highway or&#13;
expressway construction. As a result, some toll road corporations are not well organized&#13;
or vested with the authority they need to manage a modem road enterprise. High-grade&#13;
highway entities that are well-organized and managed are a critical requisite, both for&#13;
management of a rapidly expanding expressway network-one that is run efficiently&#13;
from technical, financial and safety perspectives-and in order to provide confidence to&#13;
potential investors.  The development of an implementation plan focusing on the&#13;
technical and managerial aspects of expressway operation should therefore come much&#13;
earlier in the expressway development process.&#13;
2.    High-Grade Highways in Henan Province. Henan Province has an area of&#13;
167,000 square kilometers and a population of 90 million people. It is an inland province&#13;
that is strategically located at the center of the most inhabited part of China. Most of the&#13;
strategic transport links (road and rail) running north-south and east-west cross in the&#13;
Province. The Central Government is requiring Henan to implement in the shortest time&#13;
the sections of those links located in the Province and to manage them with high&#13;
efficiency as they are critical to the nation.  Henan has already made substantial&#13;
investment in implementing sections of the north-south trunk highway (107) extending&#13;
from Beijing to Zhuhai (Guangdong Province) and the east-west trunk highway (310 and&#13;
312) extending from the Port of Lianyungang on the East China Sea (Jiangsu Province) to&#13;
Huoergousi (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region) at the border of China with&#13;
Kazakhstan. A four-lane Class I Highway exists between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang (69&#13;
km). Efforts to provide full-access control to this highway are under way. Also, the 201&#13;
km four-lane expressway between Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and Luoyang has been open to&#13;
traffic. The 48 km four-lane expressway from Zhengzhou to Xinzheng is almost&#13;
complete and its southward extension to Xuchang (46 km) is under construction and is&#13;
expected to be completed by the end of 1996. The 124 km four-lane expressway between&#13;
Xinxiang and Anyang and the Hebei border in the north is under implementation and is&#13;
expected to be completed by the end of 1997. Under the proposed Second Henan&#13;
Provincial Highway Project, the 136 km four-lane expressway between Luoyang and&#13;
Sanmenxia will be constructed during 1997-2000. Moreover, depending on availability&#13;
of financing, Henan Province plans to construct the Kaifeng-Shangqiu Expressway (203&#13;
km) during 1997-2000, the Xuchang-Luohe (46 km four-lane) expressway during 1998-&#13;
2000 and its southward extension to Xinyang (203 km) during 2000-04. All of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                    ANNEX2&#13;
expressways are or will be operated as toll roads. The tolls are expected to at least cover&#13;
the operation and maintenance costs and the debt servicing.&#13;
3.    Existing and Future Organization.  Presently, the construction of the&#13;
expressways and the operation and maintenance of the completed sections are under the&#13;
responsibility of the Henan High-Grade Highway Construction Authority (HGHCA),&#13;
which is part of the Henan Provincial Communication Department (HPCD). HGHCA&#13;
was originally set up to construct, operate and manage the provincial high-grade highway&#13;
network. HPCD is in the process of studying and proposing for official approval to the&#13;
Provincial Authorities the establishment of a High-Grade Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau (HGHAB), which will be the Public Bureau responsible for the construction,&#13;
operation and maintenance of the expressway network. However, China is increasingly&#13;
introducing the market mechanism into the Chinese economy. Toll roads are believed to&#13;
be one of the areas where more efficiency, accountability and responsiveness to the users&#13;
could be achieved through other arrangements besides a public bureau.&#13;
4.    Operation and maintenance of toll expressways in China are often reduced to the&#13;
maintenance aspects:&#13;
(a)   Preliminary concepts like level of service for toll collection (toward the&#13;
user of the expressway) or toward safety (minimum rescue delays,&#13;
protection of endangered drivers and passengers), provision of facilities&#13;
(properly equipped and maintained rest and service areas), dynamic traffic&#13;
management in congested sections, etc., are still to be fully grasped.&#13;
(b)   Secondary concepts, such as fraud control, proper return on investment,&#13;
maximization of revenues are still considered as external to Toll&#13;
Expressway Operation and Maintenance.&#13;
(c)   Finally, tertiary concepts, such as independent state control of&#13;
performance,  subcontracting  of  some  activities,  private  sector&#13;
involvement, etc., are still considered as not feasible in China.&#13;
5.    At this stage in the development of Henan's highway sector, it is necessary to&#13;
address issues of Organization, Management and Maintenance of an effective structure&#13;
that is suited to the specific needs of expressways in Henan, and by extension to China as&#13;
a whole.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#13;
6.    The objectives of the proposed study are to:&#13;
(a)   draw on internationally recognized experience as well as on experience in&#13;
Henan and other provinces and China in the field of toll expressway&#13;
network management to recommend appropriate organizational structures&#13;
(that are suitable to Chinese conditions) to efficiently and safely manage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
the high-grade highways in Henan Province, and balance the benefits to&#13;
the users with the toll authority's financial needs, and the returns to the&#13;
national economy;&#13;
(b)   propose strategies to the provincial authorities to bring the proposed toll&#13;
organization to international standards with special attention to&#13;
maintenance aspects of management including planning and budgeting,&#13;
financial systems, personnel and training, operational aspects such as&#13;
tolling, construction, communications, traffic surveillance, lists of required&#13;
equipment and inspection and maintenance procedures, traffic including&#13;
accident and incident management, marketing and public relations, etc.&#13;
C. SCOPE OF THE STUDY&#13;
The study shall include, but not necessarily be limited to the following tasks:&#13;
7.    International Models. The study should include the review and analysis of a&#13;
limited number of international models of toll expressway management such as in Europe&#13;
(France, Italy, Spain), Japan, North America (United States) and Latin America (Mexico,&#13;
Argentina). This review should concentrate, not only on the actual situation, with an&#13;
emphasis on the points listed below, but also on the various steps taken to reach the actual&#13;
situation together, whenever possible, with an analysis of the pros and cons of each step.&#13;
The objective of this step in the study is to identify leading criteria that will be used in&#13;
selecting the most appropriate Organization, Management and Tools for the Henan toll&#13;
expressway system.&#13;
8.    For each international model, the study shall list the main elements, such as, but&#13;
not limited to the:&#13;
(a)   respective master plans;&#13;
(b)   network in operation and at various stages of construction;&#13;
(c)    various steps for implementation (choice of the route, land acquisition,&#13;
design and construction, issue of permit to operate, etc.);&#13;
(d)   actors (State, Local Authorities, Public Sector, Private Sector) and their&#13;
respective roles;&#13;
(e)   various organizations, their respective responsibilities, structures and&#13;
means, as well as the criteria used for their setting up and evolution; and&#13;
(f)   various management tools (e.g., policies, personnel, procedure and fixed&#13;
and mobile equipment).&#13;
9.    The study shall analyze the way institutional aspects are handled in the various&#13;
countries, in order to outline critical factors for evaluation (such as, but not limited to,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
management control, fulfillment of standards, identification of responsibility of each&#13;
party, vested authority, financing of toll roads, etc.).&#13;
10.   The study shall analyze the basis on which organizations dedicated to the&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance of the toll expressways are established in the&#13;
various countries, outline the pro and cons, in order to select leading criteria (such as&#13;
administrative led organizations, geographically oriented organizations, financially led&#13;
organization, centralized/decentralized organizations, etc.). Because of the expected large&#13;
size of the high-grade highways in Henan and the rest of China, and the consequent huge&#13;
financial burdens to build these roads, special attention should be paid to the financing of&#13;
toll roads.&#13;
11.   The study shall analyze the way Management Tools are established in the various&#13;
countries, outline the pros and cons, in order to select leading criteria (such as integrated&#13;
tools, level of subcontracting, etc.).  The end-result of the above activities is the&#13;
identification of leading criteria, together with their respective weight, to be used in&#13;
comparing the various international models.&#13;
12.   Existing Toll Organizational Structures in Henan and China. The study shall&#13;
identify the existing institutional setup for toll organizations in Henan Province and&#13;
elsewhere in China with particular emphasis on: (a) the Central Government and the&#13;
Ministry of Communications (MOC); (b) the Henan Provincial System; and&#13;
(c) developments already occurring in other provinces in China. The study shall place&#13;
special emphasis on the legal and regulatory framework that affects the construction,&#13;
financing, operation and maintenance of toll roads. The study shall present an overview&#13;
of the National Trunk Highway System, with key milestones and the detailed planning of&#13;
the Henan portion. The existing traffic volumes as well as future traffic volumes for the&#13;
Henan toll expressways shall be estimated, mainly from existing traffic volume counts&#13;
and available prefeasibility and technoeconomic feasibility study reports.&#13;
13.   The study shall show the following financial data for each of the toll expressways&#13;
in Henan: (a) construction costs split into land acquisition/resettlement, civil works,&#13;
buildings and equipment; (b) operating and maintenance costs (both existing and&#13;
expected future costs); and (c existing and future toll fees and revenues. The study shall&#13;
also identify existing standards applicable to expressway inspection and maintenance.&#13;
14.   Risk Analysis for Operation of Toll Highways. The study shall analyze the&#13;
various risks involved in operating a toll expressway, in order to stress the value of proper&#13;
organization and management tools for the operation and maintenance of the toll&#13;
expressways. The risk analysis shall be illustrated with examples, in order to strengthen&#13;
the value of the study. These risks relate to: (a) investment related risks and their&#13;
potential effects on the overall financial soundness of a project; (b) institutional risks&#13;
resulting from improper institutional arrangements (lack of state control, nonexistent&#13;
standards); (c) organizational risks related to improper organization; (d) management&#13;
risks related to improper management tools (lack of procedures, unqualified personnel,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
under performing equipment); (e) traffic and safety risks related to traffic and safety (such&#13;
as cost of accident, loss of revenue); and (f) maintenance (short- and long-term) risks&#13;
related to maintenance, with respect to either the infrastructure or its users and in the&#13;
short term (localized inefficiency) and in the long term (integrity of the infrastructure).&#13;
15.   Proposed Level of Services. The objective of this task is to propose a set of&#13;
indicators of level of services, which shall be applicable to Henan and China in the short&#13;
term, with possible future improvement.  The study should refer to international&#13;
experience in this respect. This task includes: (a) Classification of Expressways: to&#13;
identify whether a new expressway classification, with reference to various level of&#13;
services, geometry, and urban or interurban situation is required and applicable in China;&#13;
(b) Toll Collection: the study shall propose indicator(s) for the level of service for toll&#13;
collection, as well s range(s) of values(s) (if applicable) for such items as waiting time at&#13;

Chinese and Henan situation; evolution towards a market oriented economy; criteria&#13;
defined in para. 14; and level of services defined in para. 15. The proposals shall cover:&#13;
(a)    The Organization(s):  This shall cover the:  state and provincial&#13;
institutional functions (such as, but not limited to HPCD, the Traffic&#13;
Police); local authorities; existing and planned network of toll&#13;
expressways in Henan; cross-border links and the liaison with the&#13;
neighboring provinces; construction, in broad terms, although the study is&#13;
dedicated to the operation and maintenance of the toll expressways.&#13;
(b)    State and Provincial Levels: The study shall detail the overall functions,&#13;
responsibilities and communication channels of the concerned entities.&#13;

(i)   obtain certain tax benefits with respect to its income from the&#13;
operation of its highways;&#13;
(ii)   have the authority to issue debt in the international capital markets&#13;
(as well as in domestic ones) to finance its highway projects;&#13;

ANNEX 3: ROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The traffic accident situation in Henan (as in other provinces in China) is serious.&#13;
During 1990-94, annually about 16,700 accidents took place, resulting in about 3500&#13;
fatalities and about 11,300 injuries. The number of accidents is not high, but this may&#13;
reflect a low degree of reporting of accidents, especially in rural areas. However, the&#13;
number killed is relatively high, and the rate of 93 killed per 10,000 motor vehicles (or 29&#13;
killed per 10,000 vehicles if motorcycles and tractors are included) is high and is about 40&#13;
times higher than that for Western European and North American countries. But, the&#13;
number killed per 100,000 population (3.9) is less than that in those same countries.&#13;
Also, the severity rate (24 percent) defined as the number killed divided by the total&#13;
number killed and injured is high.&#13;
2.    Due to this situation, the Bank engaged the services of two separate experts-one&#13;
a Danish and the other a Norwegian safety expert under Danish and Norwegian Trust&#13;
Funds respectively, to study the topic, identify the problems, develop a generalized&#13;
program for tackling the road safety problem and define a component for inclusion in the&#13;
proposed project. The Danish expert visited Henan in March 1995 (identification!&#13;
preparation) and July 1995 (preappraisal of the project) and submitted their final reports&#13;
in May and August 1995 respectively. These reports form the basis for the contents of&#13;
this annex.&#13;
Institutions Involved&#13;
3.    Roadway safety is a complex subject involving many issues (driver, vehicle, road,&#13;
environment, engineering, education, enforcement, attitudes and behavior, etc.) and many&#13;
entities. The Traffic Police Tearn of Henan Public Security Bureau (PSB) has the major&#13;
role. It is responsible for vehicle testing and licensing, driver training and testing, traffic&#13;
law enforcement, information and education, and collection and treatment of accident&#13;
data. In each prefecture, there is a Traffic Police Branch and in each county, there is a&#13;
Traffic Police Brigade. Each brigade has one or more Traffic Police Squadrons, which&#13;
are responsible for the management of traffic as well as propaganda. The Henan&#13;
Provincial Communications Department (HPCD) is responsible for design, construction&#13;
and maintenance of highways, as well as installation and maintenance of road traffic&#13;
signs and markings. Also, the Henan Communication Scientific Research Institute, when&#13;
asked by Public Security, undertakes vehicle testing and studies of accidents. Hospitals&#13;
treat accident victims and ambulance services transport victims.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                      ANNEX3&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
4.    There is a variety of traffic safety activities taking place in Henan province.&#13;
These activities do, however, seem to be relatively isolated activities. Even though most&#13;
of the activities are managed by HPCD and PSB, and there are reasonable relations&#13;
between the two, there seems to be limited coordination. The most important deficiency&#13;
does seem to be the total lack of long-term planning within the field of traffic safety.&#13;
Another important problem is that there is little development work going on within this&#13;
field. The main objectives of the traffic safety component will therefore logically be to&#13;
strengthen the capacity for policy-making and planning, and to initiate some pilot&#13;
development work. This should hopefully start a lasting process consisting of the&#13;
development of regular traffic safety planning and coordination, which is a prerequisite&#13;
for efficient comprehensive traffic safety work. It is further believed that the pilot work&#13;
on black spot improvement will start a lasting process, as this way of working has proven&#13;
to be one of the most efficient activities within traffic safety work. Also, the work on&#13;
accident statistics will hopefully give birth to future research on the relationship between&#13;
accidents and accident contributing factors.&#13;
5.    It was observed that the existing accident data collection system is adequate, even&#13;
if there is room for improvement. This system was elaborated a few years ago and is&#13;
used in all provinces, and hence it is not subject to local modifications for the time being.&#13;
6.    It should be noted that in general, both in HPCD and PSB, there is an agreement&#13;
as to the description of the accident situation as unsatisfactory. When it comes to&#13;
monitoring and improvements, however, it is sometimes difficult to get a positive&#13;
response. There is a general reluctance in considering possible improvements. The&#13;
present situation and present procedures are to a certain degree considered as sacred, and&#13;
improvements are not looked for.&#13;
7.    The agreements presented on the following pages are based on the discussions&#13;
between the mission, HPCD and PSB. The implementation of some elements will be&#13;
subject to approval by the Provincial Government.&#13;
Traffic Safety Policy And Planning&#13;
8.    Leading Group For Traffic Safety Planning. It was agreed to establish a&#13;
Leading Group for traffic safety coordination, policy-making and planning. The Leading&#13;
Group will be chaired by the Vice Governor, and it will have two representatives from&#13;
each of HPCD and PSB. The Deputy Directors of HPCD and PSB respectively will act&#13;
as Vice Chairmen. The main functions of the Leading Group will be to monitor the&#13;
accident situation and to propose strategies and policies as well as comprehensive traffic&#13;
safety plans to the Provincial Government. Such plans should include all aspects of&#13;
traffic safety work, also those parts which are outside the responsibility of HPCD and&#13;
PSB. The analyses of the situation should be done on a yearly basis. Short-term action&#13;
plans should also be developed on a yearly basis and objectives and longer-term plans&#13;
should equally be revised at regular intervals. The Leading Group will be a permanent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109 -                      ANNEX3&#13;
group, and its activities will go on after the termination of the project. The Leading&#13;
Group will act as a board for the Traffic Safety Secretariat (see below). It is anticipated&#13;
that the Leading Group will meet a few times per year. The Leading Group was&#13;
established in March 1996. The first tentative policy and action plan shall be presented&#13;
by the end of 1997.&#13;
9.    A Traffic Safety Secretariat.  It was agreed to establish a Traffic Safety&#13;
Secretariat (TSS) in order to prepare the work for the Leading Group. The Secretariat&#13;
was established in March 1996. It will be staffed by one specially qualified person from&#13;
each of HPCD and PSB. It is suggested that TSS be administratively situated in HPCD.&#13;
10.   The main tasks of TSS will be to carry out analyses of the traffic accident&#13;
situation, and on the basis of such analyses it will prepare traffic safety objectives,&#13;
strategies and short- and long-term traffic safety plans. These objectives, strategies and&#13;
plans will be presented to the Leading Group, which will discuss them in an annual&#13;
conference on traffic safety. When adopted by the Leading Group they will be presented&#13;
to the Provincial Government. TSS will monitor the situation and suggest new actions to&#13;
be taken and new studies to be undertaken. TSS will also act as a resource group for the&#13;
authorities.  In carrying out their duties, TSS should have the possibility to get&#13;
professional assistance from the staff in HPCD and PSB when needed.&#13;
11.   TSS was established in March 1996. Shortly after its creation, the two members&#13;
of TSS will be offered one-month training. The training will be offered in Henan&#13;
province and it will be given by a foreign consultant. The training will focus on accident&#13;
monitoring, on the elaboration of traffic safety objectives and the development of traffic&#13;
safety policies and plans, and also on the necessity to undertake regular traffic safety&#13;
development work and research. A total of two person-months consultancy, including&#13;
preparation and training, will be required. TSS will be provided with a computer, a&#13;
printer and a plotter.&#13;
Safety Audit Procedures&#13;
12.   It has been seen in industrialized countries that despite detailed road design&#13;
manuals, new road plans do not meet all the requirements for safety. Many countries are&#13;
now introducing what is called safety audits of new road plans. This work consists of the&#13;
development of a number of check lists and guidelines that explain how to check road&#13;
design to ensure that the roads do not contribute to the occurrence of accidents.&#13;
13.   It was agreed that such safety audit procedures shall be developed by TSS during&#13;
the project period. In this regard, Henan Province should avail itself of the safety audit&#13;
work to be carried out under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project&#13;
(Loan 3569-CHA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1I 10 -                    ANNEX3&#13;
Improved Computer Software&#13;
14.   The existing accident data collection form provides a large amount of data on&#13;
each accident. This makes it possible to analyze the accident data in many ways that are&#13;
useful for traffic safety planning and traffic safety work. However, the current software&#13;
only allows a few such analyses to be carried out, which seriously hampers the&#13;
exploitation of the accident data.&#13;
15.   It was agreed that PSB shall provide a computer software that is capable of&#13;
making a number of meaningful analyses of accident data. Such a software is available in&#13;
the Shaanxi province and probably in other provinces. It was agreed that PSB would&#13;
approach one of these provinces in order to acquire the software. It is also anticipated&#13;
that there is a need for one person-month training by an expert from the selected&#13;
province.&#13;
Pilot Black Spot Work&#13;
16.   Traffic safety work in industrialized countries has shown that the improvement of&#13;
traffic accident black spots is one of the most efficient traffic safety measures. Black spot&#13;
improvement work consists of the following steps:&#13;
(a)   Identification of black spots&#13;
(b)   Analyses of the accident situation&#13;
(c)    Selection of improvement measures&#13;
(d)   Implementation&#13;
(e)   Monitoring&#13;
17.   It was agreed that pilot black spot work be carried out as part of the project during&#13;
the first three years of the project period (1997-2000). For this purpose, a black spot&#13;
group will be established. The group will consist of three persons from the Road&#13;
Maintenance Section and the Road Management Section of the Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau. During the three-year period, these sections will be strengthened by two people.&#13;
18.   The study shall be carried out as an experiment with control site. Some 20-30&#13;
black spots will be identified. Out of these, some 10-15 are selected at random for&#13;
treatment. The rest will constitute the control sites. It will be tried to select half of the&#13;
black spots at grade intersections (X-crossings and Y-crossings) and half of them at road&#13;
sections. Some should be near urban areas and some in rural areas.&#13;
19.   It is reported that black spots can be identified with the existing accident data&#13;
analyses program. The data forms will be made available by the police at the prefecture&#13;
level, where they are stored. The accident reports and sketches from the accidents at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-111-                       ANNEX3&#13;
black spots will be made available to the black spot group by the police at the county&#13;
level.&#13;
20.   For the analyses of the black spots and their traffic, the group will be provided&#13;
with a photo camera, a video camera and a speed radar, and for office work it will be&#13;
provided with a computer and a printer.&#13;
21.   The group will initially be trained by a foreign consultant for one month. After&#13;
approximately six months, the consultant will come back for one month to assist and&#13;
supervise the analysis work, and after another 12 months he will come back for two&#13;
weeks to supervise the process of proposing solutions. In total there is a need for 2.5&#13;
person-months of consultancy, divided on three trips to Henan.&#13;
22.   Subsequent to the analyses, HPCD will implement the proposed improvements.&#13;
A special budget of Y 10 million will be established by HPCD for this purpose. One&#13;
million yuan will be allocated the first year, and then two, three and four million in the&#13;
following years. This special budget will also cover all specific costs related to the black&#13;
spot analyses.&#13;
23.   The black spot work is expected to be initiated by January 1997 and go on for a&#13;
three-year period. After termination of the pilot black spot work, the black spot work will&#13;
be transferred to the Maintenance Section at the prefecture level on a permanent basis.&#13;
The personnel who participated in the pilot black spot work would be responsible for the&#13;
training of the relevant personnel at the prefecture level.&#13;
Storage of Accident Files&#13;
24.   In order to carry out black spot work, it is necessary to get hold of complete data&#13;
concerning the accidents at the black spots. The identification of the black spots will&#13;
identify the place of the black spot and the number of accidents at the black spot, and it&#13;
will provide serial numbers of the accidents that have occurred.&#13;
25.   The definition of a black spot is a place where many accidents have happened&#13;
during a certain period of time. It is obvious that one has to consider a period covering a&#13;
number of years. At present, it is required to keep the accident data for at least three&#13;
years, and current practice in the Henan province is to destroy the files after three years.&#13;
It is obvious that this can seriously hamper the possibility for carrying out black spot&#13;
work. It was therefore agreed that this practice will be changed, and that accident files&#13;
will be kept at the county level for five years in the future.&#13;
Accident Analyses&#13;
26.   The knowledge about accidents and their contributing factors is extremely limited&#13;
today. The police identifies what they consider to be the "cause" of the accident.&#13;
Thereby they can determine the percentage of the accidents which is caused by for&#13;
example "reckless driving." This is, however a legal consideration, and it is seldom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112-                        ANNEX3&#13;
fruitful for initiating traffic safety actions. It is widely accepted today that an accident is&#13;
a multifactoral event, meaning that it is a combination of many factors, which in a certain&#13;
combination leads to an accident. This implies that the accident can be avoided by&#13;
influencing any of the present factors. An important step in traffic safety work is&#13;
therefore to identify factors that are overrepresented in accidents.&#13;
27.   It was agreed that the Henan Communication Scientific Research Institute would&#13;
undertake statistical work to describe the accidents according to all the contributing&#13;
factors that are available on the accident form currently in use. This could, for example,&#13;
be used to determine the number of accidents per type of vehicle. When compared with&#13;
the vehicle population, this will give an idea about the relative risk between the different&#13;
types of vehicles.&#13;
First Aid Training&#13;
28.   The first people who arrive at the scene of an accident will be other drivers and/or&#13;
the police. If there are injured people, these two categories of people (drivers and the&#13;
police) are therefore the first who are capable of helping. The problem is, however, that&#13;
none of these have any special training in first aid, and in many cases that may lead to&#13;
more harm than help. It was agreed to introduce first aid into the curriculum for driver&#13;
training of all categories of drivers, and it was agreed to introduce first aid into the&#13;
curriculum for the basic training of traffic police.&#13;
Training of the Police&#13;
29.   The police is responsible for training of children at school. Only in Zhengzhou as&#13;
many as 20 police officers are involved in this activity. None of these have, however,&#13;
received any training related to the training of children. It was agreed to offer a one-week&#13;
course/seminar to a group of police officers who are involved in this activity. The&#13;
seminar should treat items like child psychology and the child's capability to learn about,&#13;
and to cope with traffic at different ages. The seminar should be held by a Chinese expert&#13;
in training of children, and if possible with competence in traffic matters. A two-week&#13;
consultancy will be required including preparation and seminar.&#13;
Evaluation of the Traffic Safety Component&#13;
30.   The objective of the traffic safety component is, first of all, to initiate activities&#13;
that will start processes leading to improved traffic safety in a longer perspective. In&#13;
order to reach the objective, it is important that all activities are carried out and that there&#13;
is a reasonable follow-up. If this is not the case, correcting actions should be taken. It&#13;
has therefore been agreed that by the end of the fifth year, a qualified Chinese consultant&#13;
for 1 person-month shall carry out an evaluation of the highway safety component.&#13;

ANNEX 4: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDY OF&#13;
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHWAY TRAFFIC&#13;
ACCIDENTS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Henan, a land-locked province, located in China's central plain, has an area of&#13;
167,000 km2 and a population of about 90 million. Its Gross Output Value of Agriculture&#13;
and Industry has grown at about 12 percent per year since 1990. This has been&#13;
accompanied by high traffic growth, particularly around the capital Zhengzhou, with a&#13;
population of about 5.0 million. In 1993, highways accounted for 44 percent of the&#13;
passenger-kilometers, and 17 percent of the ton-kilometers carried in Henan. The road&#13;
network comprises about 47,700 km, of which 44,500 are classified (Classes I to IV).&#13;
The civilian vehicle fleet included 286,900 trucks and 165,300 passenger cars and buses.&#13;
Unfortunately, this growth in traffic was accompanied by growth in highway traffic&#13;
accidents. Over the 1990-94 period, on the average about 3,500 fatalities and 11,300&#13;
injuries per year occurred on Henan roads. The rate of 93 killed per 10,000 motor&#13;
vehicles is high and is about 40 times higher than that for Western Europe and North&#13;
American countries. But, the number killed per 100,000 population (3.9) is less than that&#13;
in those same countries.&#13;
2.    To address the highway safety problem, the Henan Provincial Communications&#13;
Department (HPCD) and the Traffic Police in the Henan Public Security Bureau&#13;
developed a highway safety program for implementation under the Second Henan&#13;
Provincial Highway Project during 1977-2000. A Leading Group for Road Safety&#13;
Coordination as well as a Traffic Secretariat to prepare the work for the Leading Group&#13;
were established in March 1996. Among many other items, the safety program calls for a&#13;
study of the factors contributing to highway traffic accidents. This Annex presents the&#13;
terms of reference for this study as well as the team to carry out the study, the&#13;
implementation schedule and the estimated budget. It should be pointed out that the&#13;
study of traffic accidents is still in the early stages of development in Henan Province as&#13;
elsewhere in China. The proposed study is to be carried out under the auspices of the&#13;
Leading Group for Traffic Safety Coordination and its Traffic Safety Secretariat (TSS).&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#13;
3.    The objectives of the study are to:&#13;
(a)   collect accident data on highways in Henan by class of road;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                       ANNEX4&#13;
(b)   investigate the factors contributing to accidents on highways including the&#13;
vehicle, the driver, the road, and the environment;&#13;
(c)    determine the relative importance of the various factors contributing to&#13;
accidents; and&#13;
(d)   make practical proposals to reduce accidents on Henan's highways&#13;
including the identification of future studies to be carried out.&#13;
C. SCOPE OF THE STUDY&#13;
The study shall include, but not necessarily be limited to the following tasks:&#13;
4.    Data Collection. This includes, but is not limited to:&#13;
(a)    Traffic Accident Data. The Traffic Police collects traffic accident data&#13;
on special forms, codes the data, stores it, analyzes it and publishes&#13;
summary results. However, little is currently being done with these data.&#13;
It is essential that the Study Team gets the accident records for a period of&#13;
3-5 years from the Traffic Police.&#13;
(b)   Road Condition Data. HPCD is responsible for intercity roads whereas&#13;
the Municipalities are responsible for roads in urban areas. Data on road&#13;
conditions; class, length, width, number of lanes, shoulders, horizontal and&#13;
vertical alignment; bridges/culverts, condition of pavement including&#13;
roughness/evenness,  speed,  traffic  volumes  (vehicles,  tractors,&#13;
motorcycles, animal-drawn carriages, bicycles, pedestrians), intersections,&#13;
traffic control devices (signals, signs, pavement markings) etc. are&#13;
available from these agencies. HPCD is developing a Road Data Bank&#13;
and a pavement Management System.&#13;
(c)   Vehicle Condition Data. These data relate to the mechanical and visual&#13;
conditions of the vehicles and are collected by the Vehicle Inspection&#13;
Stations run by the Traffic Police. The purpose of this inspection is to&#13;
ensure that vehicles are roadworthy. Henan has many of these stations&#13;
spread around the Province and has specific rules and regulations as to the&#13;
frequency of inspection and what is inspected.&#13;
(d)   Driver Data. Operators of all types of vehicles have to be licensed in&#13;
Henan Province. Drivers have to take a prescribed Driver Training&#13;
Program  and to pass examinations and road tests.  There are also&#13;
regulations on age, vision, hearing, health, etc. that have to be met. These&#13;
data are available from the Traffic Police.&#13;
5.    Surveys. It is envisioned that most of the required data for this study is already&#13;
available. However, data need to be assembled and organized to fit the software that will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118 -                       ANNEX4&#13;
be used in the analyses of the factors contributing to highway traffic accidents. Some&#13;
survey work will be required to ascertain the accuracy of the accident records available&#13;
from the Traffic Police and to complete missing entries. Limited survey may need to be&#13;
conducted on road width, friction factors, pavement evenness, alignment of the road,&#13;
traffic control devices, intersections and other locations where there are frequent&#13;
accidents (black spots). Metereological records (weather; temperature, wind, fog, snow,&#13;
rain; darkness, night, light, dusk, etc.) might also have to be consulted. Geographic&#13;
location of accidents will probably need some checking, and a system to identify&#13;
locations should be developed. Collection of data in the field should be kept to a&#13;
minimum.&#13;
6.    Software and Hardware. The study team will investigate the software and&#13;
hardware available in Henan and China to determine their suitability for analyses of&#13;
traffic accident records. It is less costly and less time consuming to use or modify&#13;
existing software than to develop a new software. Should it be found that the Chinese&#13;
software is not adequate, internationally available software would be compared and the&#13;
one most suitable for Chinese conditions should be determined. The required hardware&#13;
should be identified and arrangements for procurement of hardware and software should&#13;
be made so that they are available when needed.&#13;
7.    Data Analyses. Summaries of accident data will be developed by such factors as&#13;
class of road, road alignment, road grade, intersection type, type of pavement, traffic&#13;
volume, speed, weather, time of day time of year, condition of vehicle, overloading of&#13;
vehicles, age of driver, use of seat belts, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol,&#13;
etc. Statistical analyses would be used to find the relationships, if any, between the&#13;
number and severity of traffic accidents and the various contributing factors. These&#13;
factors could be broken into four major categories: those relating to the driver, the&#13;
vehicle, the road, and the environment. The environment refers to such factors as:&#13;
weather-related factors; time-of-day and of year factors, prevailing land uses, urban/&#13;
suburban/rural conditions, frequency of intersections and driveways, etc.&#13;
8.    Recommendations. On the basis of the results of the analyses of the factors&#13;
contributing to accidents, recommendations would be made on the most significant&#13;
factors affecting traffic accidents and the priorities to be attached to them as well as on&#13;
proposals and strategies to reduce traffic accidents. As this study is the first serious&#13;
attempt to analyze accidents in Henan Province, it is expected that it will not answer all&#13;
reasonable questions regarding traffic accidents. Accidents are complex occurrences and&#13;
generally several factors simultaneously contribute to them. Hence, one of the outputs of&#13;
the study would be the identification of future studies to be undertaken including their&#13;
relative order of priority, outline terms of reference, approximate cost, and indicative&#13;
implementation schedule. Also, the study should propose an appropriate and sustainable&#13;
institutional structure to conduct the recommended studies, ensure continuity of traffic&#13;
accident research work and to keep the research focused and pragmatic.&#13;

ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND&#13;
ACTION PLAN SUMMARY&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Environmental impact assessment (EIA) of LSE and its linking roads were carried&#13;
out by the Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Institute. The EIA reports and the&#13;
Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) were submitted to the Bank in May 1995 and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank during the preparation mission in July 1995. Based on the&#13;
comments by the Bank, the revised EIA reports, EAPs and the Environmental&#13;
Assessment Summary (EA Summary) covering both LSE and its linking roads were&#13;
submitted to the Bank in September 1995 for review. A sectoral environmental&#13;
assessment (EA) approach was applied to the RIPA component, and the Initial&#13;
Environmental Evaluation (IEE) report, the EIA reports and EAPs for the first package of&#13;
projects under the RIPA component were submitted to the Bank in September 1995 for&#13;
review. The EIA report and an EAP for the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection were&#13;
submitted to the Bank in October 1995. All of these EIA-related documents were further&#13;
reviewed by the Bank during the appraisal mission in November 1995 and the final EIA&#13;
reports, EAPs and EA Summary were submitted to the Bank by January 1996, and were&#13;
found to be satisfactory.&#13;
2.    The process of environmental review involved inputs from various units in the&#13;
province, including environmental protection bureaus, research institutions and&#13;
universities. The affected groups and NGOs along the highways, and the people subject&#13;
to resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted.&#13;
3.    The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of&#13;
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the&#13;
EIA, as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and&#13;
regulations applied to the EIA for the Second Henan Highway Project are presented&#13;
below. The major environmental standards applied in the EIA are listed in Appendix 1 of&#13;
this Annex.&#13;

(a)   The investigations for eco-environmental setting including wildlife, and&#13;
air pollution sources cover 1,000 m from both sides of the proposed roads.&#13;
Scope of the predictions for noise, atmospheric environmental impacts and&#13;
cultural relics covers areas within 200 m from both sides of the roads.&#13;
(b)   The following standards are applied as the criteria for the EIA:&#13;
(i)    Air pollution: Class 2 air quality standard (GB 3095-82);&#13;
(ii)    Noise: Class 4 standard [70 dB(A) in daytime and 55 dB(A) at&#13;
night: GB 3096-93] within 100 m from the roadsides and Class 2&#13;
noise standard [60 dB(A) in daytime and 50 dB(A) at night]&#13;
between 100 m and 200 m from the roadsides.&#13;
(c)   Considering the project features and construction cycle, the base years for&#13;
the EIA were decided to be 1997-2000 (construction period), 2000 for&#13;
initial stage prediction, 2010 for mid-term prediction and 2020 for long-&#13;
term prediction.&#13;

C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION&#13;
6.    Geology and Topography. The proposed alignment of LSE lies in loess deeply&#13;
incised loess gullies. Passing through Mount Xiaoshan, the section from Xinan to&#13;
Sanmenxia (approximately 90 km) is located in extensive hillyland with developed&#13;
gullies and rolling terrain. The section from Sanmenxia to the end point (approximately&#13;
40 km) is located in loess plateau and deeply incised gullies. There are many coal fields&#13;
including a large coal area with subsidence problems to the north of Guanyintang&#13;
township. The area that LSE traverses has many major faults, where earthquakes&#13;
occurred. The basic seismic intensity is 6 degrees to the east of Mianchi, 7 degrees from&#13;
Mianchi to Guanyintang, and 8 degrees to the west of Guanyintang.&#13;
7.    Climate and Hydrology. The project area belongs to the warm semi-arid&#13;
continental monsoon climate zone, with distinct four seasons.  The mean annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
temperatures range 12.6-13.9°C). The maximum depth of frozen ground is 20-30 cm.&#13;
The mean annual precipitation is 467-543 mm, 60-80 percent of which is concentrated&#13;
from June to September. Deflected south wind prevails in summers while deflected north&#13;
wind prevails in winters. The project area belongs to the Yellow River basin and the&#13;
rivers are rainfed seasonal ones except Jianhe, Qinglonghe and Canglonghe Rivers.&#13;
Groundwater is phreatic water lying 60-80 m under the ground except in floodland.&#13;
8.    Socioeconomic Situation.  The proposed alignment of LSE goes through&#13;
Mengjin County under Luoyang City, Sanmenxia City, Yima City, Mianchi and Shanxian&#13;
Counties under Sanmenxia City. There are rich mineral resources, mainly coal, bauxite,&#13;
iron, molybdenum, gold, lead, etc., which are easy to mine. In 1993, Luoyang and&#13;
Sanmenxia, including counties, cities and districts directly thereunder, had a total&#13;
population of 7.96 million, accounting for 8.9 percent of the population of Henan&#13;
2&#13;
Province. The population density was 300 persons/km  which is lower than that for the&#13;
province as a whole. As important industrial and mining base of the province, Luoyang&#13;
had gross output value of agriculture and industry (GOVAI) of Y 34.55 billion in 1993,&#13;
i.e., 11 percent of the provincial total. In the same year, the economic growth rate was 13&#13;
percent, which was higher than the provincial average. Sanmenxia had a GOVAI of&#13;
Y 8.83 billion, i.e., 3 percent of the provincial total. The project area is rich in tourism&#13;
resources, including famous scenic spots like Longmen Grottos, White Horse Temple,&#13;
Guandi Temple, Baiyunshan Natural Reserve, Yanshao Cultural Site. All of these are&#13;
located 5-10 km away from the proposed alignment.&#13;
9.    Land Use. Luoyang and Sanmenxia constitute 15.4 percent of the total provincial&#13;
land area, including farmland which is about 8 percent of the provincial total. Luoyang&#13;
has more than 40 rich and large mineral deposits, mainly coal, aluminum, molybdenum&#13;
and iron. Molybdenum and aluminum are proven to rank the first in the country. In&#13;
Sanmenxia, 57 deposits have been discovered, mainly coal, gold, aluminum, and lead.&#13;
The farmland in the project area produce two crops a year with winter wheat playing the&#13;
leading role. The annual grain yield is 600 kg/mu (9.0 tons per ha) on the average. As a&#13;
result of frequent natural disasters, mainly droughts, agricultural development is&#13;
considerably limited. However, forestry and fruit production have developed at a faster&#13;
pace in recent years.&#13;
10.   Ecological Setting.  The project area is located in the warm temperature&#13;
deciduous and broad-leafed forest zone. As a result of a long history of forest destruction&#13;
for reclamation, the natural vegetation has changed to a great extent. Because of varying&#13;
tectonics in hillylands, gullies, loess hills, ridges and loess plateaus, distribution of local&#13;
vegetation varies from place to place. There are more than 100 common species of&#13;
plants, including 14 species of crops, 27 species of vegetables, 19 species of green and&#13;
ornamental plants. There are no rare or endangered species within the 1,000 m from the&#13;
proposed alignment.&#13;
11.   According to zoogeographic zoning of China, the project area falls in the Mount&#13;
Xiaoshan and loess hilly and plain areas in North China zone. North China fauna of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
paratactic realm predominate, and some south and north species are also found. There are&#13;
some species of oriental realm, but the population is small. The number of species is&#13;
comparatively small, and there are few large and middle-sized forest animals. There are&#13;
relatively large populations of small-sized rodents in fields, waste slopes, shrubs, loess&#13;
gullies etc.. Also, there are various types and large numbers of insects, fowl and&#13;
livestock in the project area. No rare and endangered species were found within 1,000 m&#13;
from the proposed alignment.&#13;
12.   Cultural Relics. The project area is in an important ancient route (Yaohan&#13;
Route) connecting Guanzhong and Huabei plains, and thus a battlefield of different&#13;
periods. According to the field surveys by the Henan Provincial Archaeological Institute,&#13;
there are 18 archaeological sites along the proposed LSE alignment which would be&#13;
affected by the project. Ranks of the cultural relics preservation of these sites are city-&#13;
level protection (4 sites), county-level protection (6 sites) and unclassified (8 sites). None&#13;
of them are of national or provincial-level protection.&#13;
13.   Air Quality. There are five major industrial air pollution sources in the project&#13;
area, namely Quarry of Luoyang Cement Factory, Sanmenxia Cement Factory, Yuxi&#13;
Cement Factory, Sanmenxia Aluminum Power Plant, and Sanmenxia Pulp Mill. There&#13;
are many small township and private factories and coal mines which are contributing a&#13;
large discharge of CO and other pollutants. Atmospheric baseline monitoring (TSP, CO&#13;
and NOJ) was carried out at six sites along the proposed LSE alignment in January 1995&#13;
for five consecutive days, and supplemented at three additional sites in November 1995&#13;
due to the significant change of the alignment. According to the monitoring results, NO,&#13;
concentrations were much lower than the ambient air quality standard in both maximum&#13;
and daily average values. At all monitoring sites, maximum TSP concentrations were&#13;
below the standard. At four sites, daily average TSP concentrations were above the&#13;
standard, but they did not exceed the standard value significantly. Maximum CO&#13;
concentrations were below the standard at all monitoring sites, but daily average CO&#13;
concentrations significantly exceeded the standard at five monitoring sites. The major&#13;
reasons are that (a) there are many coal mines which contribute significant CO emissions,&#13;
(b) there are many township and private coking plants using primitive coking methods,&#13;
and (c) incomplete coal combustion was carried out by local residents for heating&#13;
purposes in winter.&#13;
14.   Noise. Baseline noise monitoring was carried out at six sites in January 1995,&#13;
supplemented at three additional sites in November 1995 due to the significant change of&#13;
the alignment. The monitoring results suggest that at all sites except Hejiazhuang and&#13;
Leijiawan, the noise levels (Leq) in both daytime and at night are below the noise&#13;
standards which are adopted as assessment criteria, and at most sites the noise level is&#13;
fairly low compared with the Class 2 standards. The noise levels at Hejiazhuang and&#13;
Leijiawan slightly exceed the standard at night time because of the Long-Hai Railway&#13;
and National Highway 310.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
15.   Water and Soil Loss. The local soil category is cinnamon soil which includes&#13;
six kinds of soil. The local soil has a pH value of 7.0-8.8 and is generally fertile.&#13;
According to the local topography, geomorphology, soil and vegetation, the project area&#13;
is divided into deeply incised gullies, loess plateau and loess rolling hills. Water and soil&#13;
loss vary to a great extent in different areas. Generally, the erosion module is 1,500 to&#13;
2,000 t/km2 in deeply incised gullies, 500 to 2,000 t/kmn in loess plateaus, 1,000 to&#13;
2,000 t/km2 in highland and hillyland areas, and 500 to 1,000 t/km  in low loess hills.&#13;
Recently, more attention has been paid by local government to water and soil&#13;
conservation. Water conservation measures practiced in the local area include reforesting&#13;
farmland and increasing vegetation coverage. Lead in soil at seven sites ranges between&#13;
15.37 and 39.98 mg/kg, which is not only lower than the national and provincial averages&#13;
but also significantly lower than the value of 300 mg/kg, which is recommended by the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture as the criterion for soil with a pH value of 6.5.&#13;
D. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THEIR MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
16.   Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding LSE and its&#13;
linking roads are summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plans&#13;
(EAPs)of LSE and its linking roads. The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts&#13;
identified in the EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases,&#13;
and what institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAPs&#13;
during the three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAPs are summarized as&#13;
Appendix 2 of this Annex..&#13;
Design Phase&#13;
17.   Alternative Alignments. Quite a few comparative alignments schemes were&#13;
considered in the project design phase. In this alignment scheme, the section from west&#13;
of Mianchi to Hongtuao of Shaanxi has a relatively unfavorable configuration and an&#13;
alternative alignment was proposed to go from Mianchi through Xiamatou,&#13;
Zhuchengcum, Suzhaicum, Beigou, Yinnhao and reach Zhangcun Road. After leaving&#13;
the railway for the coal mine at Houying, it goes west to pass by Beigetiao, Lishupo and&#13;
deflects southwest to pass through Tuling and Langwo. This alternative alignment is&#13;
relatively smooth and 4 km shorter, but as passing through extensive coal mine settlement&#13;
areas, it poses difficulties for subgrade treatment. Another consideration was given to&#13;
Guanyintang section from Mianchi to Sanmenxia. Two alternatives were proposed for&#13;
this section. One goes to the south of Guanyintang to avoid the coal mine with&#13;
subsidence problems, and the other goes to the north of Guanyintang which has caves&#13;
with subsidence problems. The south scheme was adopted with due consideration to&#13;
avoid unfavorable geological conditions, coal mines and archaeological sites as well as to&#13;
minimize land acquisition, as well as impacts of air pollution and noise on residential&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
18.   Social Disruption. In order to minimize problems of community separation and&#13;
isolation due to the project construction, adequate numbers of overpasses, passageways&#13;
and bridges were incorporated into the project design.&#13;
19.   Soil Erosion. High embankment slopes will be stabilized with grout, concrete&#13;
grids, shotcrete and grass. Deep cut slopes will be protected with grout, concrete grids,&#13;
shotcrete or sprayed grass seeds in line with the geology, ramp height and slope. Water&#13;
sumps will be provided as appropriate, to lead natural slope water to ditches or other&#13;
drainage facilities. Planting of trees and grass in the median divider and along the&#13;
roadside was included in the design where appropriate. Temporary and permanent&#13;
drainage systems were designed to minimize soil crosion and alteration of hydrological&#13;
regimes.&#13;
20.   Earthworks. Since the land undulates to a considerable extent, large quantities&#13;
of excavation and backfill works are required in many sections, which will cause&#13;
significant impacts on ground stability and ecological setting as well as dust and noise&#13;
problems during the construction stage. Particular attention was paid to balance the cuts&#13;
and fills along LSE so that spoil from excavation works are best used for embankment&#13;
works and impacts of borrow/spoil operations on farmland are minimized. Quarries and&#13;
borrow sites were selected, in such a way as to minimize the dust and other problems at&#13;
environmentally sensitive locations such as residential areas.&#13;
21.   Noise. Most of the villages within 200 m from the roadsides are small and&#13;
sparsely populated. Altogether, 16 environmentally sensitive sites were selected for&#13;
special attention. According to the traffic noise prediction during the operation phase&#13;
(2000, 2010 and 2020), the noise level at four sites will significantly exceed the&#13;
assessment criteria in 2000. In later years, the noise will increase and the noise level will&#13;
exceed the assessment criteria by more than 10 dB(A) in five sensitive sites in 2020. To&#13;
avoid such noise problems, the following measures have been identified and integrated&#13;
into the designs of LSE, considering predicted noise levels and local situations. For the&#13;
linking roads, fences on the side facing the proposed roads will be raised and double glass&#13;
windows will be furnished for the first row of houses where appropriate.&#13;
(a)   Noise barriers at the sensitive sites (1,700 m at two sites by 2000, 285 m at&#13;
one additional site by 2010);&#13;
(b)   Heightened fences besides the first row of residences facing the road (three&#13;
sites by 2000 and one additional site by 2010);&#13;
(c)   Double glass windows for the first three rows of residences (three sites by&#13;
2000 and two additional sites by 2010);&#13;
(d)   Forest belts with a width of more than 30 m (one site by 2000 and two&#13;
additional sites by 2020); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-130 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
(e)   Resettlement of houses near the roadsides (within 24 to 55 m from the&#13;
roadsides, depending on the local situation-12 sites by 2000).&#13;
22.   Air Pollution. In the initial operation stage (2000), maximum CO concentrations&#13;
at all 16 sensitive sites will be within the assessment criteria while maximum NO,&#13;
concentrations at 6 sites will exceed the assessment criteria. In the mid-operation stage&#13;
(2010), maximum CO concentrations will slightly exceed the assessment criteria at eight&#13;
sites mainly due to high background concentrations, and maximum NO, concentrations&#13;
will exceed the assessment criteria at 11 sites with the maximum 2.2 times higher than&#13;
the criteria. In the late operation stage (2020), the maximum CO concentrations at nine&#13;
sites will exceed the assessment criteria, and maximum NOX concentrations at all sites&#13;
will exceed the assessment criteria, with a maximum value 3.3 times higher than the&#13;
assessment criteria. Such conditions will happen during the peak traffic volume and&#13;
when the meteorological conditions are worst. However, such incidents do not occur&#13;
frequently. This problem will be dealt with by improving vehicle emission controls to&#13;
reduce NOX and other vehicle exhaust emissions, strengthening vehicle emissions&#13;
inspection and planting trees at sensitive sites. Construction of residences, schools,&#13;
hospitals and other sensitive buildings will not be allowed within 200 m from both sides&#13;
of LSE.&#13;
23.   Water Pollution. Adequate permanent and temporary drainage systems were&#13;
incorporated in the project design to minimize surface water pollution and disturbance to&#13;
irrigation channels and existing drainage systems. Wastewater treatment facilities as well&#13;
as boilers equipped with precipitators were included in the design of service area facilities&#13;
in order to prevent direct discharge of wastewater to public water bodies.&#13;
24.   Cultural Relics.  An archaeological field survey was carried out during&#13;
December 1994 through February 1995 by the Henan Provincial Archaeological Institute,&#13;
following the relevant rules and regulations in China to identify cultural relics to be&#13;
affected by LSE. Altogether, 18 archaeological sites were identified to be protected along&#13;
LSE. Ranks of the cultural relics preservation of these sites are city-level protection (4&#13;
sites), county-level protection (6 sites) and unclassified (8 sites). None of them are of&#13;
national or provincial-level protection. An archaeological salvage and protection plan&#13;
was developed and integrated as a part of the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.&#13;
All the salvage activities will be carried out after land acquisition and prior to project&#13;
commencement.&#13;
25.   Flooding. All bridges, culverts and roadside drainage systems were adequately&#13;
designed to meet requirements for safe discharge of floods (300 year design floods for&#13;
super-large bridges and 1 00 year floods design for other bridges and culverts).&#13;
26.   Landscape. Afforestation will be undertaken to improve landscape at median&#13;
dividers, slopes and ditches as well as beyond the right-of-way. Also, landscaping and&#13;
other aesthetic effects were considered during the design of bridges (without endangering&#13;
safety of the structures), service areas and interchanges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
Construction Phase&#13;
27.   Fugitive Dust and Other Air Pollution. Quarries, material borrow sites, waste&#13;
disposal sites and transportation routes to construction sites were identified as the major&#13;
areas that create dust and other air pollution. Road surfaces, excavation areas and&#13;
construction sites will be sprayed with water and kept moist particularly near towns,&#13;
water sources and other sensitive locations. Access roads will be upgraded, widened and&#13;
paved where necessary, and sprayed regularly to minimize fugitive dust. Stockpiles and&#13;
storage areas will be either covered or sprayed. Construction materials will be covered&#13;
during hauling to prevent undue dust or debris on roads. Asphalt and lime stone mixing&#13;
equipment will have dust collectors and will be located at least 200 m from residential&#13;
areas on the leeside of the wind directions. Construction machines will be equipped with&#13;
exhaust gas control units.&#13;
28.   Noise.  Since operations of machinery associated with excavation and road&#13;
construction may cause hearing damage in the event of prolonged exposure, hearing&#13;
protection will be provided for construction workers. Construction machinery and trucks&#13;
will be equipped with proper noise control devices and will be properly operated and&#13;
maintained. Construction activities will be suspended between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 am&#13;
near residential areas. Transportation of construction materials will be undertaken with&#13;
careful consideration to minimizing noise impacts on residents along the roadside.&#13;
Traffic management, including dissemination of traffic rules and setting up of speed&#13;
limits will be strengthened.&#13;
29.   Protection of Land Resources. Forests will not be used for material borrow&#13;
sites. Reforestation will be undertaken for any previous forests upon completion of&#13;
construction activities. Afforestation will be carried out on previous wasteland used for&#13;
borrow or spoil sites. Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites where&#13;
possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, top soil layer will be saved and&#13;
returned after construction works is completed to minimize impacts on ecosystems and&#13;
agriculture. Education of construction workers will be strengthened to protect natural&#13;
resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching will be strictly prohibited.&#13;
30.   Soil Erosion and Water Pollution. Trees and grass will be planted on side&#13;
slopes, and along the roadside, where appropriate.  Appropriate measures, either&#13;
rehabilitation or reconstruction, will be taken if the existing irrigation or drainage systems&#13;
are damaged. All necessary measures will be taken to prevent earth and stones from&#13;
silting up rivers, water channels or existing irrigation and drainage systems. Construction&#13;
camps will be located far away from Yanghe and Qinglonglian Rivers, which are used for&#13;
drinking water sources. Temporary channels or conduits will be constructed for irrigation&#13;
and drainage during the construction of permanent drainage systems. All reasonable&#13;
measures will be taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted water from construction&#13;
activities into rivers and irrigation channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132 -                      ANNEX5&#13;
31.   Construction Camps. Septic tanks will be installed at construction camp sites to&#13;
prevent direct discharge of sanitary sewage to public water bodies. Sludge in sewer&#13;
treatment pits will be disposed of regularly. Garbage will be collected in garbage cans at&#13;
fixed locations and disposed of regularly. Drinking water at construction sites will meet&#13;
China's national drinking water standards.&#13;
32.   Cultural Relics. Construction works will be stopped immediately if any cultural&#13;
relics are discovered as a result of road construction or excavation activities. The local&#13;
cultural relics authorities will be informed and a field survey of the site will be&#13;
undertaken. Excavation will not be resumed until authorized institutions identify the&#13;
importance and necessary preservation measures of the discovered cultural relics.&#13;
33.   Traffic Management. Local resources will be used to the extent possible to&#13;
avoid long distance transportation of construction materials. Adequate traffic control&#13;
measures will be implemented in consultation with the Communications Department and&#13;
Public Security Bureau to prevent or minimize traffic jarns during the construction&#13;
period. Where sections of existing roads are used for transportation of construction&#13;
materials, temporary service roads will be constructed as appropriate to alleviate&#13;
congestion of existing roads.  A construction material transportation plan will be&#13;
developed to avoid hauling activities during peak hours especially on existing roads. In&#13;
order to guarantee safety, efficient lighting equipment and safety signs will be installed&#13;
on temporary roads during the construction, and adequate traffic regulations will be&#13;
adopted and implemented for temporary roads.&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
34.   Noise and Air Pollution. Unnecessary use of horns will be strictly restricted at&#13;
night. Noise barriers or other appropriate noise protection measures will be taken at&#13;
locations where noise exceeds standards, based on the results of monitoring.&#13;
35.   Vehicle Management. Better vehicle maintenance and management will be&#13;
enhanced to keep vehicles in good conditions. Vehicle noise and emission inspection&#13;
will be strengthened and vehicles which do not meet noise and exhaust emission&#13;
standards will not be allowed to use LSE and other roads in the province. Random&#13;
vehicle emission inspections will be undertaken at the entrance of the interchanges.&#13;
Public awareness campaigns and education will be undertaken to familiarize people with&#13;
air and noise pollution regulations. In order to avoid future noise and air pollution&#13;
problems, development of residential areas and construction of sensitive buildings such&#13;
as schools and hospitals will be prohibited within 200 m from the roadside of LSE.&#13;
36.   Risk of Hazardous Material Spill. Any vehicle transporting hazardous materials&#13;
will be required to obtain permissions from the Public Security Bureau (PSB), the&#13;
Communications Department and the Fire Protection Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133 -                    ANNEX 5&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING&#13;
37.   During the construction and operation of LSE and its linking roads, environmental&#13;
monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment, identify&#13;
unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental&#13;
protection measures as appropriate.   The High-Grade Highway Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Center under the Henan Provincial High-Grade Highway Construction&#13;
Authority (to be called Henan Provincial Communications Environmental Monitoring&#13;
Center: HPCEMC) will be mainly responsible for environmental monitoring during the&#13;
construction and operation phases. However, noise, vibration and fugitive dust will be&#13;
monitored by the environmental supervisor at each construction contract section. The&#13;
enviromnental monitoring for the linking roads during both construction and operation&#13;
phases will be undertaken by local environmental monitoring stations. An annual&#13;
environmental monitoring report would be furnished to the Bank during the construction&#13;
phase and for each of the first three years following completion of construction.&#13;
38.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase will include air&#13;
quality, noise and vibration, and water quality. Air quality, noise and water quality will&#13;
be monitored during the operation phase. In addition, vehicle exhaust and noise will be&#13;
inspected during the operation phase. The detailed monitoring plan is presented below.&#13;
39.   Air Quality. Items to be monitored will include fugitive dust (by environmental&#13;
supervisors) and total suspended particulates (TSP) during the construction phase and&#13;
nitrogen oxides (NOJ), CO, TSP and hydrocarbons (HC) during the operation phase.&#13;
During the construction phase, TSP will be monitored 4 times a year for 3 consecutive&#13;
days each time and fugitive dust once a week. Monitoring sites will be construction sites,&#13;
quarries and material borrow sites, and major roads used for hauling construction&#13;
materials. According to the EAP, fugitive dust will be monitored at least 6 places around&#13;
construction sites. During the operation phase, NO,, CO, TSP and HC will be monitored&#13;
three times a year, each time for 5 consecutive days and 4 times a day at 9 monitoring&#13;
sites along LSE. NO,, CO and TSP will be monitored during the operation period at 5&#13;
monitoring sites along the linking roads.&#13;
40.   Noise and Vibration. During the construction phase, vibration (for LSE only)&#13;
and noise monitoring will be carried out by environmental supervisors in each contract&#13;
section in daytime and at night on a weekly basis at construction sites, quarries, material&#13;
borrow sites and major construction materials hauling roads. Ad hoc monitoring will also&#13;
be undertaken. During the operation phase, noise monitoring will be carried out 4 times a&#13;
year, in daytime and at night at 9 sites along LSE and 5 sites along the linking roads (as&#13;
identified in the EAPs). Ad hoc monitoring will also be undertaken.&#13;
41.   Water Quality. During the construction phase, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO),&#13;
biochemical oxygen demands (BOD), chemical oxygen demands (COD), suspended&#13;
solids (SS), oil and lead will be monitored once a week at 100 m both upstream and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
downstream of the Qinglonghe Bridge. During the operation phase, the same items will&#13;
be monitored at the same sites 3 times per year.&#13;
42.   Vehicle Exhaust and Noise Inspection. Vehicle exhaust gasses and noise (CO&#13;
and HC in gasoline-powered vehicles, and smoke density and noise in diesel-powered&#13;
vehicles) will be randomly inspected at the entrance of interchanges.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF RIPA COMPONENT&#13;
43.   The Rural Roads Improvement Program to help alleviate poverty (RIPA) under&#13;
the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project includes 76 road segments under 30&#13;
systems (a set of road segments) in 29 poor counties of Henan Province. Since the road&#13;
segments under the RIPA are large in number, and most of the RIPA projects are&#13;
upgrading of the existing roads and small in the size of construction works, it was agreed&#13;
that a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (EA) approach would be applied to the RIPA&#13;
project.&#13;
44.   The Sectoral EA approach is summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE): All the RIPA subprojects will be&#13;
classified into two categories, Category I and Category II. IEE was carried&#13;
out only for the first package of RIPA project because of lack of necessary&#13;
information for the rest of sub-projects. Therefore, classification of the&#13;
rest of sub-project needs to be done at a later stage when the subsequent&#13;
packages of RIPA project are prepared.&#13;
(i)    Category I projects are those which are not expected to have&#13;
significant environmental impacts.  This category of projects&#13;
include upgrading of existing roads without substantial widening&#13;
and land acquisition.&#13;
(ii)    Category II projects are those which may have potentially&#13;
significant environmental impacts.  This category of projects&#13;
includes new road construction, upgrading of existing roads with&#13;
substantial widening and land acquisition, and other road&#13;
upgrading projects passing through enviromnentally special areas&#13;
such as national parks, nature reserves, and important cultural&#13;
heritage sites.&#13;
(b)   Preparation/review of EIA reports and EAPs&#13;
For Category I projects, only Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) are&#13;
required to determine various environmental protection measures to be&#13;
implemented, based on the principles on environmental protection&#13;
measures. For Category II projects, both EIAs and EAPs are required. All&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
EIA reports and EAPs will be submitted to the Bank and reviewed by the&#13;
Bank together with the application of a package of subprojects.&#13;
45.   Regarding the first package of RIPA subprojects, only three road segments will be&#13;
newly constructed, while the remaining 20 road segments will be upgraded. The major&#13;
upgrading works include:&#13;
(a)   improvement/construction of culverts;&#13;
(b)   widening of roads in a small number of road segments; and&#13;
(c)   upgrading of road conditions to all-weather gravel-earth surface.&#13;
46.   Major Environmental Protection Measures for the RIPA Projects: Major&#13;
environmental protection measures to be commonly implemented for most RIPA projects&#13;
are summarized below and listed in Appendix 2.&#13;
Environmental Protection Measures during the Design Stage&#13;
(a)   Soil Erosion. Engineering and biological measures will be taken to&#13;
stabilize slope and protect soil erosion. Temporary and permanent&#13;
drainage systems will be constructed to minimize soil erosion and&#13;
alteration of hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation&#13;
channels. Trees and grass will be planted to minimize soil erosion, air&#13;
pollution and enhance good landscape along the proposed road.&#13;
(b)   Subgrade Soil Works.  Borrow areas will be identified in the land&#13;
acquisition areas where possible to minimize farmland and forest&#13;
destruction.&#13;
(c)   Afforestation. Trees will be planted alongside the sides of the road to&#13;
improve aesthetics and grass will be planted alongside slopes to protect the&#13;
embankments against erosion.&#13;
Environmental Protection Measures during the Construction Stage&#13;
(a)   Dust/Air Pollution. All reasonable steps, including watering, will be&#13;
taken to minimize dust pollution by construction works, and transportation&#13;
of construction materials, particularly in places near towns, water sources&#13;
etc. Stockpiles and storage areas will be covered or watered to prevent&#13;
dust pollution. Trucks to transport construction materials will be covered&#13;
to minimize spills. Lime mixing and tar heating sites will be located far&#13;
away from residential areas, at least 200 m of the lee side of the wind&#13;
direction.&#13;
(b)   Soil Erosion/Water Pollution. Spoil will not be stored on riverbeds,&#13;
farmland, forests and cultivated fields to protect water sources and natural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136 -                       ANNEX5&#13;
ecology, and prevent interruption of rivers and flooding. Rivers and water&#13;
sources will be cleaned up as appropriate if they are interrupted by soil and&#13;
spoil. All reasonable measurers will be taken to prevent direct discharge&#13;
of polluted water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation&#13;
channels.&#13;
(c)   Construction Camps. Adequate measures will be taken to prevent water&#13;
pollution by waste water from construction camp sites. Drinking water&#13;
will meet the China national drinking water standards. Garbage will be&#13;
collected in garbage cans on fixed places and disposed of regularly. Clean&#13;
hygienic conditions will be strictly maintained.&#13;
(d)   Noise. Where residences are located near the construction sites, noisy&#13;
construction works will be undertaken during the daytime (6:00-22:00).&#13;
Maintenance of machines and trucks will be strengthened to keep them&#13;
with low noise&#13;
(e)    Conservation of Land Resources.  Arable land, especially good&#13;
farmland, will not be selected as material borrow sites as much as&#13;
possible. Afforestation will be undertaken for the land used for temporary&#13;
use of construction.   Education of construction workers will be&#13;
strengthened to protect natural resources, wild plants and animals.&#13;
Poaching will be strictly prohibited.&#13;
(f)    Construction Safety. Management regulations will be established to&#13;
ensure safe construction activities. Warning limits will be clearly decided&#13;
and people should be evacuated prior to any blasting operations.&#13;
Temporary roads will be provided with lightening facilities and traffic&#13;
marks to prevent from possible traffic accidents.&#13;
(g)   Cultural Relics. If fossils, coins, artifacts of value or antiquity, structures&#13;
and other remains of geological or archaeological interest are found, the&#13;
local cultural authority will be immediately informed of such discovery,&#13;
and excavation shall be stopped until identification of cultural relics by the&#13;
authorized institution of preservation is completed&#13;
Environmental Protection Measures during the Operation Stage&#13;
(a)   Noise/Air Pollution. At roads adjacent to villages, use of horns will be&#13;
minimized or prohibited during night time.  Vehicle speed will be&#13;
restricted along villages. Macadam road segments close to villages will be&#13;
often watered . In dry seasons, watering will be carried out at least two&#13;
times a day. Roads will be maintained in a good conditions to minimize&#13;
traffic noise. Noise will be monitored periodically to take appropriate&#13;
measures where needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137 -                     ANNEX5&#13;
(b)   Transportation of Hazardous Materials. Trucks transporting hazardous&#13;
materials will obtain permits from the Public Security Bureau and&#13;
Transportation and Fire Fighting Departments.&#13;
(c)   Others. During and after the construction of RIPA roads, new permanent&#13;
buildings will not be allowed to be constructed within 10 m from the&#13;
roadsides. new hospitals, schools and large residential areas will not be&#13;
built within 200 m from the roadsides. Traffic regulations will be strictly&#13;
enforced and education to comply with traffic regulations will be provided&#13;
to residents in the vicinity of the roads.&#13;
47.   Environmental Monitoring for the RIPA  Projects.  The environmental&#13;
monitoring will be carried out by local environmental monitoring centers through&#13;
contracts with the county transportation bureaus.  The monitoring results will be&#13;
submitted to the higher levels of transportation and environmental bureaus for their&#13;
review. Dust, TSP, asphalt smoke, noise and river water quality will be monitored during&#13;
the construction phase and TSP, NO,, CO, noise and river water quality during the&#13;
operation phase. Water quality monitoring both in the construction and operation phases&#13;
will also be undertaken for Category II projects.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF YANGJIA-BAIJIAZHAI CONNECTION&#13;
48.   Basic Environmental Description. The project area is located in the floodland&#13;
on the south bank of the Yellow River which is less covered by vegetation. There are&#13;
some gullies along the proposed alignment, but the area is generally flat and located in&#13;
loess land. As investigated, there are two environmentally sensitive sites, namely&#13;
Nanchengzi and Yangjia. Through investigation, there are no rare or endangered species&#13;
in the project area and no cultural relics along the proposed alignment. To collect&#13;
baseline monitoring data, air quality (TSP, CO and NOJ) and noise were monitored at&#13;
two sites in October 1995. The monitoring results indicate that the project area is calm&#13;
and air quality is fairly good.&#13;
49.   Potential Environmental Impacts and their Mitigation Measures.  Major&#13;
potential impacts and their mitigation measures are almost the same as those for LSE and&#13;
its linking roads. The noise level will not be significant in the initial operation stage&#13;
(2000) but will exceed the standard from 2010. The first two rows of houses in the north&#13;
part of Nanchengzi and Yangjia will be furnished with double glass windows by 2010. In&#13;
addition, considering that the southern half of the proposed road will be constructed&#13;
during the period of 2000-2010, the northern half will handle one way traffic and driving&#13;
speeds will be limited where necessary along the sensitive areas during this period, to&#13;
avoid possible interference of construction and operation of the proposed road. Air&#13;
quality at the sensitive sites will not exceed the standard significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

staff in the future, will carry out the environmental monitoring works of&#13;
LSE both during construction and operation phases, except fugitive dust,&#13;
noise and vibration. Approximately 10 monitoring staff of HPCEMC will&#13;
work for the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.&#13;
51.   Upon completion of LSE, Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project Offices will come&#13;
under the Henan Provincial High-Grade Highway Management Authority (HPHGHMA).&#13;
The Environmental Protection Sections and their staff of Luoyang and Sanmenxia Project&#13;
Offices will remain the same under HPHGHMA. Menjin, Xinan, Yima, Mianchi and&#13;
Shanxian will set up their separate expressway management subagencies. Menjin, Xinan&#13;
and Yima subagencies will have one full-time environmental manager respectively, and&#13;
Mianchi and Shanxian subagencies will have two environmental managers respectively.&#13;
During the operation period, these environmental managers will be responsible for&#13;
regular environmental management of LSE under the guidance of the Environmental&#13;
Management Agency of HPHGHMA.&#13;
52.   For linking roads, the following institutional arrangements will be undertaken.&#13;
(a)   Each of the relevant cities and counties has established its own project&#13;
office staffed with one full-time environmental inspector. Each contractor&#13;
will provide a part-time environmental staff to assist the environmental&#13;
inspector in fulfilling his/her environmental responsibilities.&#13;
(b)   Upon completion of the project, the environmental responsibilities will be&#13;
handed over to the environmental protection sections under the local&#13;
communications bureaus. Each of the environmental protection sections&#13;
will have one to two full-time staff to work for environmental protection/&#13;
management of all the highways under its jurisdiction.&#13;
(c)   Environmental monitoring during both construction and operation phases&#13;
will be undertaken by local environmental monitoring stations through&#13;
contract with the relevant agencies. Environmental monitoring data in the&#13;
construction phase will be submitted to the relevant project offices and&#13;
local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs). During the operation&#13;
phase, such data will be submitted to the environmental protection sections&#13;
under the local communications bureaus and local EPBs.&#13;
53.   The institutional arrangements for environmental protection of RIPA projects are&#13;
presented below.&#13;
(a)   During the construction stage, Henan Provincial Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau (HPHAB) and its subsidiary bodies at city/prefecture and&#13;
county/township levels will be responsible for the environmental&#13;
management of RIPA projects. Three environmental staff are currently&#13;
assigned in HPHAB for the RIPA projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-140 -                    ANNEX5&#13;
(b)   For the first package of RIPA projects, each of the 4 communications&#13;
bureaus at city/prefecture level will have separate environmental&#13;
protection sections with 3-4 full time staff. Each of the eight county&#13;
communications bureaus will have a communications environmental&#13;
protection section with 1-2 full time staff. Each contractor will assign one&#13;
environmental management staff for the implementation of environmental&#13;
protection measures addressed in the EAP and the bid documents.&#13;
Environmental monitoring will be carried out by local environmental&#13;
monitoring stations through contract with HPHAB.&#13;
(c)   During the operation period, an environmental management network under&#13;
the leadership of the Environmental Protection Division of HPCD will be&#13;
formed to conduct environmental management of RIPA projects.&#13;
54.   For the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection, environmental management during both&#13;
construction and operation stages will be carried out by the environmental protection&#13;
section of Expressway Construction Authority of Sanmenxia with two full time staff.&#13;
The environmental protection section with one full time staff under Linbao&#13;
Communications Bureau will be directly responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
environmental protection works under the proposed highway project.  During the&#13;
construction stage, a part-time environmental manager will be assigned to assist the&#13;
environmental staff under the Linbao Communications Bureau. The environmental&#13;
monitoring during both construction and operation stages will be carried out by Linbao&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Station through contract with Linbao Communications&#13;
Bureau.&#13;
55.   The following environmental training will be undertaken to provide adequate&#13;
training for environmental staff at the Environmental Protection Agency at the&#13;
Headquarters in Zhengzhou, the Environmental Protection Sections at the Project Offices,&#13;
environmental supervisors at the contract sections and monitoring staff of HPCEMC. All&#13;
the training will be provided locally and no environmental training in other parts of China&#13;
or abroad will be undertaken under the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.&#13;
(a)   Two new environmental staff of the Environmental Management Agency&#13;
and four environmental experts of the Environmental Protection Sections&#13;
in Luoyang and Sanmenxia project offices will have training on&#13;
environmental management of transportation projects, for a month or two&#13;
in Zhengzhou.&#13;
(b)   An environmental training course for about a month will be undertaken in&#13;
Zhengzhou to provide training on environmental supervision and on noise,&#13;
vibration and dust monitoring.  Approximately five environmental&#13;
supervisors out of eight contract sections will need the training, while&#13;
others are supposed to have sufficient expertise from the previous projects.&#13;

1. Routc Selection              The alignment was selected from two alternatives with due con-  HPHSDI&#13;
sideration to minimize land acquisition, impacts of air pollu-&#13;
tion and noise on residential areas, and to avoid unfavorable&#13;
geological conditions, coal mines and archaeological sites.&#13;
2. Social Disruption            Adequate numbers of overpasses, passageways and bridges     HPHSDI&#13;
were designed to meet the requirements for crossing of local&#13;
people, animals and vehicles.&#13;
3. Soil Erosion                 Planting of trees and grass on median divider, sideslopes, and  HPHSDI&#13;
along the roadside, was included in the design where appropri-&#13;
ate. Slope protection, such as grout, concrete grids, etc., were&#13;
incorporated in the design.&#13;
Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to  HPHSDI&#13;
minimize soil erosion and alteration of hydrological regimes,&#13;
including impacts on irrigation channels.&#13;
4. Earthworks                   In view of huge quantities of earthworks, due consideration was  HPHSDI&#13;
given to properly allocate roadbed earthworks. Quarries and&#13;
borrow sites were selected, taking into account the dust and&#13;
other problems at environmentally sensitive locations such as&#13;
residential areas.&#13;
5. Water Pollution              Waste water treatment facilities as well as boilers equipped with  HPHSDI&#13;
precipitators were designed for service areas.&#13;
6. Noise                        Adequate measures such as noise barriers, brick walls and  HPHSDI&#13;
double-glass windows were identified and integrated in the&#13;
design and bid documents.&#13;
7. Flooding                     All of super-large, large, medium and small bridges and    HPHSDI&#13;
culverts were adequately sized to meet requirements for safe&#13;
discharge of design flood (300 years for super-large bridges,&#13;
100 years for other bridges).&#13;
S. Culbual Relics               Cultural relics survey was carried out and an archeological  HPICRA/&#13;
salvage plan was developed.                                HPHSDI&#13;
9. Afforestation                Afforestation plan was developed to reduce air pollution prob-   HPHSDI&#13;
lems and enhance better landscape.&#13;

1. Protection of Land Resources   Forests will not be used for material borrow sites. Reforesta-  Contrators&#13;
tion will be undertaken for any previous forests used for tempo-&#13;
rary purposes upon completion of construction activities.&#13;
Afforestation will be carried out on previous wasteland used for&#13;
borrow or spoil sites upon completion of construction activities.&#13;
Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites wherevr&#13;
possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, top soil&#13;
layer will be saved and retumed after construction work is com-&#13;
pleted, so as to minimize impacts on ecosystem and agriculture.&#13;
Education of construction workers will be strengthened to&#13;
protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching&#13;
will be strictly prohibited.&#13;
2. Soil Erosion/Water Pollution   Trees and grasses will be planted on side slope, and along the    Contradors&#13;
roadside, where appropriate. Appropriate measures, either&#13;
rehabilitation or reconstruction, will be taken, if the existing&#13;
irrigation or drainage systems are damaged.&#13;
All necessary measures will be taken to prevent earth and&#13;
stones from silting up rivers, water channels, or existing irri-&#13;
gation and drainage systems. Construction camps will be&#13;
located far away from Yanghe and Qinglonglian rivers, which&#13;
are used for drinking water sources.&#13;
Temporary channel or conduit will be constructed for irrigation&#13;
and drainage, during the construction of permanent drainage&#13;
systems.&#13;
All reasonable measurers will be taken to prevent direct dis-&#13;
charge of polluted water from construction activities into rivers&#13;
and irrigation channels.&#13;

vent dust pollution. Trucks to transport construction materials&#13;
will be covered to minimize spills.&#13;
Asphalt mixing and lime-soil mixing will be carried out cen-&#13;
trally to the extent possible. Asphalt mixing and lime-soil mix-&#13;
ing sites will be located at least 200 m from residential areas on&#13;
the lee side of the wind direction. Asphalt mixers will be&#13;
equipped with adequate dust collectors. Necessary protection&#13;
measures will be taken for asphalt plant operators to protect&#13;
their health.&#13;
5. Transportation Management    Hauling route of construction materials will be selected in a  Contractors&#13;
careful manner to minimize interference with existing commu-&#13;
nications facilities, and dust and noise.&#13;
Adequate actions to direct traffic will be taken in consultation&#13;
with communications and public security departments, to pre-&#13;
vent or minimize traffic jans during the construction period.&#13;
6. Noise                        Noisy construction works will not be undertaken during the  Contractors&#13;

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
ISSUES&#13;
1.    Context. This annex describes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts&#13;
under the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project and the framework for&#13;
implementation of resettlement established during project preparation. The annex is&#13;
divided into two main sections: (a) impacts of land acquisition and resettlement under&#13;
the project; and (b) framework for implementation of land acquisition and resettlement.&#13;
All information related to the RIPA component of the project relates only to the first&#13;
year's package under RIPA.&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts&#13;
2.    Construction of the various components of the project will require 1,060.42&#13;
hectares (ha) of permanent land acquisition and will affect about 11,567 persons. Land&#13;
acquisition will be necessary for the expressway, the linking roads, the Yangjia-&#13;
Baijiazhai Connection (YBC) and the roads under the RIPA component. Persons whose&#13;
houses or the enterprises where they are working are affected as a result of construction&#13;
will need to be resettled and/or rehabilitated. It was agreed that the project impacts would&#13;
be identified through two types of surveys. These are: (a) a census survey of affected&#13;
people and properties to determine the physical impact of the project; and (b) a baseline&#13;
socioeconomic survey of the affected persons to determine their existing income levels&#13;
and standards of living.&#13;
(a)   Census survey. The land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the&#13;
project were determined as a result of the census survey carried out by the&#13;
Henan Planning Survey and Design Institute (HPSDI). The survey was&#13;
carried out between November 1994 to May 1995. This survey was based&#13;
on the preliminary engineering designs of the expressway and the&#13;
interchanges. The survey of the RIPA component roads to be constructed&#13;
during the first year of implementation and the YBC and linking roads was&#13;
carried out in July 1995. The census surveys were carried out with the&#13;
participation of affected persons and their local representatives.  The&#13;
survey indicated that 1,060.42 ha of land would need to be acquired and&#13;
11,567 persons will be affected. Out of the 11,567 persons affected, 3,548&#13;
would need to be relocated. Most of the persons affected by land&#13;
acquisition will be rehabilitated through land redistribution. Thirty-two&#13;
persons affected by relocation of two enterprises will resume employment&#13;
in the reconstructed enterprises. Another 235.26 ha of land would need to&#13;
be leased temporarily during project construction, affecting 1,903 persons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-153 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
(b)   Socioeconomic Survey. In order to establish the baseline of incomes and&#13;
standards of living of the affected persons, a detailed socioeconomic&#13;
survey will be carried out by the Legal Institute of the Zhengzhou&#13;
University before the initiation of resettlement implementation.  The&#13;
baseline survey is expected to be completed by March 31, 1996.&#13;
Framework for Implementation of Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
3.    In order to mitigate the impacts of land acquisition and resettlement under the&#13;
project, a comprehensive framework of implementation of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities has been established. This framework consists of the following:&#13;
(a)   legal framework and resettlement policies&#13;
(b)   institutional arrangements&#13;
(c)   costs and budgets&#13;
(d)   implementation framework and schedule&#13;
(e)   participation of affected persons&#13;
(f)   redress of grievances of affected persons&#13;
(g)   monitoring of implementation&#13;
These elements of the implementation framework are discussed below.&#13;
4.    The Objective And Principles Of Resettlement. The main objective of the&#13;
resettlement program under the project is to ensure that all categories of affected persons&#13;
are able to at least restore, if not improve, their standard of living after resettlement. Both&#13;
national and provincial governments have established principles that help ensure that the&#13;
above objective of resettlement implementation is achieved. These principles aim to:&#13;
(a) minimize land acquisition and resettlement in order to reduce adverse impacts of the&#13;
project; (b) restore or improve the area and standards of housing; (c) consult the affected&#13;
persons regarding their relocation and rehabilitation choices, and rates of compensation&#13;
offered; (d) provide alternative farmland to affected persons through land redistribution;&#13;
(e) in cases where land redistribution is not possible, provide jobs in enterprises to the&#13;
affected persons; and (f) ensure resettlement is satisfactorily completed before initiation&#13;
of construction activities.&#13;
5.    Legal Framework And Resettlement Policies.  The legal framework for&#13;
implementation of land acquisition and resettlement has been established based on the&#13;
following laws/regulations:&#13;
(a)   Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China-1986&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-154 -                     ANNEX6&#13;
(b)   The implementation methods of land management in Henan Province-&#13;
1987&#13;
(c)   The notice on the revised standards/rates of compensation for attachments&#13;
on the ground taken by construction projects in Henan province-1989&#13;
(d)   The circular on compensation/subsidiary for attachments to the ground&#13;
taken by construction projects in Henan province-1 993&#13;
(e)   The Circular on Compensation for the attachments to the ground taken by&#13;
construction projects in Sanmenxia-1993&#13;
(f)   The circular on Implementation of the tentative regulations on utilization&#13;
tax on cultivated land in Henan-1 989.&#13;
The Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for the project were prepared based on the above&#13;
regulations. Implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement activities under the&#13;
project will be carried out on the basis of specific provisions of the RAP.&#13;
6.    Based on the census survey carried out by HPSDI, the following categories of&#13;
project impacts were identified. The compensation/resettlement policies for each of these&#13;
categories of impacts is as follows:&#13;
(a)   Houses And Other Structures Affected By The Project. All affected&#13;
houses and structures will be compensated on the basis of replacement&#13;
value of the affected assets. Depreciation will not be taken into account&#13;
while calculating the total compensation payable and no deduction will be&#13;
made for the value of salvageable materials. Inflation factors from the&#13;
year 1993 (when the compensation rates were fixed) until the time of&#13;
payment of compensation will be used to calculate the actual&#13;
compensation payable.&#13;
(b)   Agricultural Land Affected. Two types of compensation will be paid for&#13;
land  affected  under the  project:   (i) land  compensation; and&#13;
(ii) resettlement subsidy. Land compensation will be paid at the rate of&#13;
4-6 times (depending on the location of the land) the average annual&#13;
output value of affected land. Resettlement subsidy will be paid at the rate&#13;
of 3-10 times the average output value of affected land depending on the&#13;
per capita land holding of affected farmers. The details regarding the&#13;
multiplier to be used in specific cases are given in the RAPs.&#13;
(c)   Enterprises Affected By The Project. Affected enterprises will be&#13;
rebuilt in the vicinity on land to be provided by the local villages. The&#13;
cost of land will be paid by the project. The affected workers will&#13;
continue their employment in the reconstructed enterprises. They will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-155 -                      ANNEX6&#13;
paid an allowance equivalent to their wages for the period when&#13;
production will be disrupted.&#13;
(d)   Persons Losing Agricultural Land. Most of the affected persons losing&#13;
agricultural land will be given alternative land through land redistribution&#13;
in the affected village. The minimum average per capita land holding is&#13;
0.1 mu. If, as a result of land acquisition, the average per capita land&#13;
holding of the village falls below this level, some of the affected persons&#13;
would need to be provided nonagricultural jobs in order to restore the&#13;
average land holding of the affected village to the minimum standard of&#13;
0.1 mu. However, in the Second Henan Provincial Highway Project, there&#13;
is no need to provide enterprise jobs since the residual per capita&#13;
landholdings are substantially higher than 0.1 mu (in most cases above&#13;
0.75 mu).&#13;
(e)   Persons Affected By Temporary Acquisition Of Land. Land to be&#13;
leased temporarily, during the construction period, will be compensated&#13;
for the duration of the lease. The project will provide compensation for&#13;
the land leased, the loss of crops on the land, and the cost of restoration of&#13;
land after use. The compensation for the land leased, equivalent to its&#13;
annual production value, will be paid to the affected persons.&#13;
(f)    Affected  Infrastructure.   Affected  civic  infrastructure  will be&#13;
reconstructed at the new sites. Private infrastructure facilities will be&#13;
compensated at replacement rates. All basic facilities, such as, schools,&#13;
health centers, etc. will be provided by the project at the new sites.&#13;
(g)   Affected Access to Underpasses. Affected access to underpasses will be&#13;
provided at regular intervals in order to restore access of the affected&#13;
persons to their lands, markets and other facilities. The number, location&#13;
and design features of the underpasses in each village have been decided&#13;
after extensive consultations with the affected people.&#13;
7.    Institutional Framework. The administration office within HGHCA will be&#13;
responsible  for coordination  of land  acquisition  and  resettlement activities.&#13;
Implementation of resettlement will be carried out by the local county/township and&#13;
village govermments. HGHCA will pay the local governments the necessary funds for&#13;
this purpose.&#13;
8.    Coordination. A special resettlement coordination group (RCG), headed by the&#13;
Deputy Provincial Governor, has been established by the provincial government for&#13;
coordinating the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement under the project.&#13;
The RCG consists of representatives of all departments concerned with resettlement&#13;
implementation and also from the affected local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.    Costs and Budget. The costs associated with implementation of the RAP will be&#13;
a part of the project budget and will be included in the investment plan for the project.&#13;
The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at Y 196.2 million. This&#13;
does not include the cost of RIPA component roads following the first year of&#13;
implementation. The cost estimate for the various activities associated with land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement for the LSE component is given in Table 1.&#13;

be factored into the cost estimates at the rate of 5 percent per year for the period between&#13;
RAP preparation and implementation.&#13;
10.   Linkage Of Resettlement And Construction Schedule. The RAPs contain a&#13;
detailed schedule of implementation of all land acquisition and resettlement related&#13;
activities. All land acquisition and resettlement activities relating to the LSE, linking&#13;
roads, the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection and the first year package of RIPA will be&#13;
completed at least one month before the initiation of construction activities on the site. It&#13;
is expected that the LAR activities for the LSE will be completed in February 1997,&#13;
whereas construction activities are expected to start in March 1997. The month-wise&#13;
implementation schedule of land acquisition and resettlement activities is given in&#13;
Table 2.&#13;

11.   Participation and Consultations. The project has been designed with the&#13;
participation of representatives of the affected persons in townships and village&#13;
governments. The census of project-affected persons (PAPs) was carried out with the&#13;
involvement of affected persons and their representatives. The PAPs will also build their&#13;
houses themselves at the resettlement sites with the compensation amount provided to&#13;
them. The project agencies have constantly informed the affected people about the&#13;
project and the details of RAP implementation and will continue to do so during&#13;
implementation. The PAPs will receive a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) to&#13;
provide them with detailed information about the land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
policies under the project and their own specific resettlement entitlements. The RIB will&#13;
be distributed to the PAPs after the RAP has been approved by the Bank.&#13;
12.   Grievance Redressal. The affected persons will have ample opportunity for&#13;
redressal of their grievances regarding any aspect of land acquisition and/or resettlement&#13;
implementation. If any PAP is dissatisfied with any aspect of land acquisition and/or&#13;
resettlement, he/she can first appeal to the resettlement office/local government office at&#13;
the township/county level. If the decision of this office is not considered satisfactory by&#13;
the PAP an appeal can be lodged with the project office or the government office at the&#13;
city level. Another appeal, if necessary, can be made to the provincial coordination&#13;
group. In case the affected person is still not satisfied, he/she can also approach the&#13;
People's court.&#13;
13.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The resettlement implementation framework as&#13;
described in detail in the RAPs provides for monitoring and evaluation of RAP&#13;
implementation. Monitoring will be of two types: (a) internal; and (b) external. Internal&#13;
monitoring will be carried out by a unit especially designated for the purpose in the&#13;
administrative office of HGHCA. The main indicators to be monitored are: (i) payment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-158-                       ANNEX6&#13;
of compensation; (ii) construction of houses at the resettlement sites; (iii) reconstruction&#13;
of affected enterprises; and (iv) payment of allowances according to eligibility. HGHCA&#13;
will submit internal monitoring reports to the Bank every six months. The first&#13;
monitoring report will be submitted by September 30, 1996. Detailed formats for&#13;
quantitative internal monitoring have been annexed to the RAP.&#13;
14.   External monitoring will be carried out by the Legal Institute of Zhengzhou&#13;
University. Apart from verification of the information submitted on the basis of internal&#13;
monitoring, the following indicators will be monitored through external monitoring:&#13;
(a) the adequacy of compensation paid to PAPs for affected houses; (b) the quality of&#13;
houses constructed at resettlement sites; (c) payment of wages to affected workers during&#13;
the period when the enterprises are stopped; (d) restoration of income levels and&#13;
standards of living of the affected persons. The external monitoring agency will submit&#13;
its report every six months. The first external monitoring report will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank by December 31, 1996. A final monitoring and evaluation report will also be&#13;
prepared after project completion and submitted to the Bank by December 31, 2001.&#13;

ANNEX 9: PROPOSED MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
1.    From the start of project implementation through completion, progress will be&#13;
monitored against the project objectives. To facilitate this process and provide objective&#13;
means of evaluation of how well the project is meeting its objectives, a limited number of&#13;
indicators are developed for each objective. For each indicator, the baseline level should&#13;
be stated and the target values for various years in the future (such as mid-term year,&#13;
implementation completion review (ICR) year and full impact year) should be estimated.&#13;
2.    Table I lists the project objectives, the indicators for each objective, the baseline&#13;
level, and the target values for each indicator for the years 1999 (mid-term), 2001 (ICR&#13;
year) and 2003 (full impact year). This table also depicts the source of information for&#13;
estimating the value of each performance indicator. The values for these indicators are to&#13;
be estimated by HPCD and to be submitted to the Bank by the end of 1996. The project's&#13;
objective related to reduction of congestion on the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Highway (LSH)&#13;
will be monitored using the average daily traffic volume as well as the average vehicle&#13;
speed on the existing highway (LSH) and the proposed expressway (LSE). The objective&#13;
relating to stimulation of economic activity in the Luoyang-Sanmenxia corridor will be&#13;
monitored using the gross output value of agriculture and industry (GOVAI) for the&#13;
affected counties along the corridor. The indicators for the objectives relating to helping&#13;
alleviate poverty in the poor counties consist of GOVAI of affected counties, average&#13;
daily traffic and thc number of days the road is closed to traffic. Strengthening of&#13;
institutional capabilities will be monitored through qualitative evaluation of sharing of&#13;
new knowledge and exercising new/improved skills by staff trained under the project as&#13;
well as by improvement of performance of specific functions and activities.  The&#13;
indicators for the increase in roadway safety comprise the number of fatalities and&#13;
injuries on LSH and LSE and for the Henan highway network as a whole.&#13;
3.    The monitoring of outputs during implementation of the project will be based on&#13;
the monitoring of procurement processes, percent completed of civil works, consultants&#13;
engaged to prepare studies, number of person-months of training achieved,&#13;
disbursements, compliance with loan covenants, audit reports, etc. Table 2 presents the&#13;
key performance indicators during implementation of the various components of the&#13;
project as well as the source of information for estimation of the various indicators.&#13;
HPCD will, by the end of 1996, complete the missing information in this table and revise&#13;
the values of the indicators for the various years of the implementation period of the&#13;
project.&#13;

contract section will be assigned or nominated to carry out the supervision of the&#13;
environmental protection measures addressed in the Environmental Action Plans (EAP)&#13;
and integrated in the bid documents. The results will be included in the engineering&#13;
supervision reports and reported periodically to the environmental protection staff at the&#13;
district level. The results of environmental supervision will be annually reported to the&#13;
Bank in the annual report. The monitoring items will include:&#13;
(a)   brief description on environmental protection measures supervised/&#13;
inspected during the reporting period; and&#13;
(b)   brief description of problems regarding environmental protection measures&#13;
and their reasons and possible solutions.&#13;
5.    Environmental Monitoring:   Environmental monitoring items, methods,&#13;
frequencies, monitoring sites have been clearly decided in the EAP (Annex 5).&#13;
Environmental monitoring will be carried out by an environmental monitoring group in&#13;
the Central Supervision Laboratory except noise and dust, which will be conducted by&#13;
environmental supervisors at respective contract sections. The results will be reported to&#13;
the environmental protection staff at the district level. The results of environmental&#13;
monitoring will also be annually reported to the Bank through the annual report.&#13;
6.    Environmental monitoring items during the construction period would&#13;
include: air quality (TSP and dust); noise/vibration; and water quality (BOD/COD,&#13;
suspended solids (SS), oil).&#13;

MONITORING OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
9.    The monitoring and evaluation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) agreed&#13;
between the Bank and HPCD will be carried out both internally and extenally (Annex6).&#13;
Internal monitoring will be carried out by a unit in HPHGHCA regarding LSE and the Land&#13;
Acquisition and Resettlement Department of HPHAB regarding RIPA.  An intemal&#13;
monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank every six months, with the first one due on&#13;
September 30, 1996 and the last one on the completion of the land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities. The Legal Institute of Zhengzhou University will conduct the&#13;
external monitoring of resettlement and will submit a monitoring report every six months,&#13;
with the first one to be submitted by December 31, 1996 and the last one at the completion&#13;
of the project (December 31, 2000). A final monitoring report and evaluation report will&#13;
also be prepared after project completion and submitted to the Bank by December 31, 2001.&#13;
10.   The main indicators of land acquisition and resettlement monitoring have been&#13;
identified and are included in the RAPs. They are:&#13;
(a)   T imely payment of compensation to affected entities of various categories&#13;
according to the levels described in the RAP;&#13;
(b)   Progress of construction of new houses and quality of construction, also&#13;

            supply and installation of electrical, electronic and
            mechanical equipment for toll collection, telecommunications
            and lighting facilities, as well as construction of service
            areas and management and maintenance buildings; 2)
            construction of the Yangjia-Baijiazhai Connection (YBC) to
            link the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE) in Shaanxi
            Province with the existing Highway 310 in Henan Province; 3)
            construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of four linking
            roads that will interconnect and feed traffic to the LSE at
            interchanges; 4) improvement and new construction of rural
            roads in a program to alleviate poverty (RIPA) in poor
            counties in Henan; 5) construction supervision of the LSE,
            the linking roads and RIPA; 6) provision of equipment; 7)
            institutional strengthening and training; and 8) a highway
