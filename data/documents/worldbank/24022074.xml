It goes without saying that we all need to breathe to liveâ&#128;&#148;but for many people in the&#13;
world today, breathing can also lead to death. In fact, 3.7 million people died world-&#13;
wide in 2012 alone from the chronic or the acute eï¬&#128;ects of breathing in atmospheric&#13;
pollutants, according to the World Health Organization. Eighty-eight percent of these&#13;
deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
In 2010, ambient air pollution was the ï¬&#129;fth leading cause of premature death in the&#13;
developing world and the third highest environmental health risk. We know that the&#13;
poor suï¬&#128;er the most because they have fewer options to move to cleaner neighbor-&#13;
hoods or take protective measures.&#13;
&#13;
If left unaddressed, these problems are expected to grow worse over time, as the world&#13;
continues to urbanize at an unprecedented and challenging speed. Urban, peri-urban,&#13;
and rural pollution emissions combine in dangerous ways. Deï¬&#129;ciencies in transport,&#13;
industrial practices, workplace safety, and housing expose people to toxic emissions at&#13;
home, at work, and in-between. In many cities around the world, the lack of adequate&#13;
air quality control and enforcement puts millions of people at risk of developing debil-&#13;
itating and often fatal illnesses related to ambient air pollution.&#13;
&#13;
The economic burden of air pollution also weighs heavily on developing countries.&#13;
Premature death, illness, lost earnings, and medical costs can hurt productivity,&#13;
which is essential for economic growth. This can hamper a growing cityâ&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
provide the very opportunities that new urban residents expect, whether services or&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
These risks, in the 21st century, are not acceptableâ&#128;&#148;and the World Bank Group is&#13;
taking action.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis contained in this report is a ï¬&#129;rst step toward a more systematic, cross-&#13;
sectoral, and evidence-based approach to enhancing air quality management in World&#13;
Bank lending and technical assistance to developing countries. The report highlights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing the World Bank's Approach to Air Quality Management                              vii&#13;
&amp;#12;that improving air quality can be achieved in the face of urbanization when proactive&#13;
leaders are willing to institute the right policies and investments: a nation can have&#13;
clean air and healthy lungs in addition to the economic beneï¬&#129;ts of urbanization.&#13;
&#13;
It ï¬&#129;nds that World Bank interventions can be more successful if air quality manage-&#13;
ment is clearly prioritized rather than treated as an add-on, investments proceed on&#13;
the basis of solid analytical foundations and are appropriately cross-sectoral to address&#13;
the diverse sources of ambient air pollution in diï¬&#128;erent country contexts. Report les-&#13;
sons will help guide the collaboration of diï¬&#128;erent centers of expertise at the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#148;whether they be staï¬&#128;ed by urban, rural, health, transport, energy, or environ-&#13;
mental specialistsâ&#128;&#148;to deliver more optimal pollution management and environmental&#13;
health results.&#13;
&#13;
We also have a good idea of the tools and models that have worked in diï¬&#128;erent parts&#13;
of the world to turn the corner on decades of rising pollution and put cities on a more&#13;
livable and economically attractive footing. We now need to step up our game and&#13;
adopt a more comprehensive approach to ï¬&#129;xing air quality, so that people can breathe&#13;
more easily and enjoy longer, healthier, and more productive lives.&#13;
&#13;
At a time when megacities are emerging at great speed in places like South and East&#13;
Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, and with much of urban population growth expected to&#13;
take place in developing countries by 2050, it is imperative that we ï¬&#129;nd collaborative&#13;
solutions to enhance air quality management and lessen the health burden of pollu-&#13;
tion. Without further action, air pollution will continue to worsen and become a mas-&#13;
sive hurdle to achieving a prosperous future for the poor and bottom 40 percent of the&#13;
worldâ&#128;&#153;s population. Eï¬&#128;ective interventions, on the other hand, promise to deliver mul-&#13;
tiple wins in terms of productivity, quality of life, and even climate change. Enhanc-&#13;
ing air quality management is a no-regrets development option. It should become a&#13;
priority investment.&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
An estimated 3.7 million people died worldwide in 2012 from either&#13;
the chronic or the acute eï¬&#128;ects of breathing atmospheric pollutants,&#13;
according to the World Health Organization. (When the eï¬&#128;ects of house-&#13;
hold air pollution are added, that total rises to 7 million.) The vast majority of these&#13;
deathsâ&#128;&#148;88 percentâ&#128;&#148;occurred in the developing world. Ambient air pollution was the&#13;
ï¬&#129;fth leading cause of premature death in the developing world in 2010, and the third&#13;
highest environmental health risk (see ï¬&#129;gure ES.1). Ambient air pollution causes sub-&#13;
stantially more illness and death than the use of unimproved sanitation or unimproved&#13;
water sources.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the severity of this problem, the World Bank has had diï¬&#131;culty&#13;
in adapting its portfolio and instruments to the challenge of addressing&#13;
ambient air quality concerns. This report aims to examine the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s experi-&#13;
ence in supporting countriesâ&#128;&#153; eï¬&#128;orts to improve ambient air quality and environmental&#13;
health outcomes and to extract lessons learned and recommendations for enhancing&#13;
future World Bank support to clients. The speciï¬&#129;c objectives are to review the problem&#13;
of ambient air pollution in the developing world, including its health impacts and the&#13;
current state of air quality management; to understand what types of project activities&#13;
the World Bank has supported that address air pollution and environmental health;&#13;
to assess how successful those projects have been in improving air quality and reduc-&#13;
ing health impacts from air pollution; to draw out lessons and highlight good prac-&#13;
tices based on case examples; and to recommend ways to enhance future World Bank&#13;
eï¬&#128;orts in reducing air pollution and the associated health burden.&#13;
&#13;
The context for this work is that the World Bank has begun to establish a new&#13;
program on pollution management and environmental health. Its objectives&#13;
are to help clients reduce pollution levels and associated health risks and thereby improve&#13;
environmental health outcomes; to generate new knowledge and improve our under-&#13;
standing of pollution and its health impacts in both urban and rural areas; and to promote&#13;
increased awareness and understanding of pollution and its health impacts among policy-&#13;
makers, planners, and other relevant stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;
One of the four components of the program focuses on helping developing countries&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
In many developing countries, environmental pollution continues to pose serious risks&#13;
to human health and productivity, making it diï¬&#131;cult to achieve economic growth and&#13;
break out of poverty. Furthermore, the disease and death from environmental degra-&#13;
dation results in a signiï¬&#129;cant economic burden that is often disproportionately carried&#13;
by poor people. Eï¬&#128;ectively addressing environmental health challenges therefore can&#13;
be a crucial part of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s eï¬&#128;orts to reduce poverty and increase shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
This report speciï¬&#129;cally deals with air pollution, which according to the World Health&#13;
Organization (WHO) was the single largest environmental health risk globally in 2012&#13;
(WHO 2014a).1 Air pollution from outdoor and household sources jointly accounted&#13;
for more than 7 million deaths (3.7 million from ambient air pollution and 4.3 million&#13;
from household air pollution).2 Developing countries are the most aï¬&#128;ected by the del-&#13;
eterious health eï¬&#128;ects of air pollution, and they bear a signiï¬&#129;cant economic burden&#13;
associated with loss of life, illness, and productivity losses. With economic develop-&#13;
ment, air pollution represents a growing problem, particularly in developing countries,&#13;
with ambient air pollution mostly aï¬&#128;ecting cities and urban areas there. Nonethe-&#13;
less, countries continue to face problems with even the most basic aspects of ensuring&#13;
adequate air quality management.&#13;
&#13;
For decades the World Bank has been supporting developing countries in address-&#13;
ing issues related to pollution management and environmental health. The current&#13;
knowledge on the enormous health burden associated with air pollution underscores&#13;
the need for a comprehensive approach by the Bank to help countries reduce ambi-&#13;
ent air pollution. This report examines the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approach to and experience with&#13;
supporting countries through projects that aim to address ambient air pollution and&#13;

2&#13;
  According to the WHO, many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap,&#13;
mortality attributed to ambient and household sources cannot simply be added together; hence the total estimate of&#13;
around 7 million deaths.&#13;

PROJECTS&#13;
&#13;
OBJECTIVES OF PORTFOLIO REVIEW&#13;
This portfolio review had the following speciï¬&#129;c objectives, based on a selection of Bank&#13;
projects that were assigned the Pollution Management and Environmental Health&#13;
theme code: to identify projects that include activities with the potential to reduce air&#13;
pollution, to develop a set of typologies to group similar project activities together in&#13;
terms of their potential to reduce air pollution, and to assess potential health impacts&#13;
of the identiï¬&#129;ed projects.&#13;

UNDERLYING PRINCIPLESâ&#128;&#148;LINKAGES&#13;
BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION SOURCES,&#13;
AIR POLLUTION CONCENTRATIONS,&#13;
AND IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH&#13;
An understanding of the linkages between sources of air pollution, concentration&#13;
of pollutants, and pollution impacts on human health provides a guiding context for&#13;
undertaking the work described in this report. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 summarize these&#13;
linkages with regard to particulate matter, which is the pollutant with the most delete-&#13;
rious consequences for health, and appendix B describes the linkages in more detail.&#13;
&#13;
A number of terms (air pollution emissions, air pollution concentration, exposure, and&#13;
health impacts) and relationships (spatial population distribution and concentration-&#13;
response function) are used in describing these linkages, where terms are data points&#13;
and relationships are functions that are used to link the terms in order to ultimately&#13;
arrive at estimates of health impacts. A more detailed description of terms and rela-&#13;
tionships is provided in appendix B.&#13;

A REVIEW OF CASE EXAMPLES&#13;
&#13;
METHODOLOGY&#13;
Three cases have been selected for presentation in this report as examples of how&#13;
operational and analytical activities have addressed air quality, using upfront air pollu-&#13;
tion assessment approaches (further information about the three projects can be found&#13;
in appendix D).&#13;
&#13;
These three cases provide examples of the three main methodologies for assessing the&#13;
air pollution and health impacts of abatement actions in projects (see table 3.1):&#13;
     1. Assessment based on monitoring of air pollution: Santiago Urban Transport Projects&#13;
        (1 development policy loan, 1 technical assistance loan, and 1 GEF grant).&#13;
     2. Assessment based on a combination of monitoring and modeling: Ulaanbaatar (UB) Air&#13;
        Monitoring and Health Baseline (AMHIB) Study and the Ulaanbaatar Clean&#13;
        Air Project.&#13;
     3. Assessment based on monitoring of air pollution and assessing health impacts, including on&#13;
        poor groups: Peru Environmental Development Policy Loan program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE SANTIAGO URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECTS&#13;
These were a set of projects (supported by DPL, TAL and GEF grant) implemented in&#13;
the 2003 to 2011 period that, in addition to supporting the overall public transportation&#13;
system in Santiago, also supported air pollution control programs by helping to improve&#13;
Santiagoâ&#128;&#153;s air quality through reducing local air pollutants like SOx, CO, PM, and NOx&#13;
(particularly through the DPL and TAL projects) and by promoting the reduction of&#13;
greenhouse gases from ground transportation in Santiago through a long-term modal&#13;
shift to more-eï¬&#131;cient and less-polluting forms of transport (particularly through the&#13;
GEF project). The program involved interventions to reduce the emissions from public&#13;
buses, increase the use of bicycles, implement up-to-date emission testing, develop busi-&#13;
ness schemes for operation of the public transportation system, monitor the bus systems,&#13;
and implement overall traï¬&#131;c planning. This case is an example of how air quality moni-&#13;
toring can be used to measure the improvement in air quality that has resulted from&#13;
project implementation.&#13;

A PROPOSED APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING&#13;
THE AIR QUALITY AND HEALTH IMPACTS&#13;
OF WORLD BANK PROJECTS&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The review of the portfolio of air-pollution-relevant projects and the examination of case&#13;
examples highlighted, among other aspects, the need for a shift from a sector-driven focus&#13;
to a comprehensive approach to air quality management in World Bank projects as well&#13;
as the dearth of baseline information and data that should be included in project planning&#13;
and preparation in order to assess the impacts of projects on air pollution reduction and&#13;
health outcomes. These observations are indicative of the need for a strategic, system-&#13;
atic approach in Bank projects that address air quality management issues. This chap-&#13;
ter examines how cost-eï¬&#128;ective air quality management strategies may be applied in the&#13;
development of World Bank projects that incorporate air pollution abatement measures.&#13;
&#13;
INTEGRATED AIR QUALITY&#13;
MANAGEMENT CONCEPT&#13;
In order to shift from a sector-driven approach and ensure that a project has an opti-&#13;
mal economic and technical approach to reducing air pollution and its health impacts,&#13;
one has to start by applying an air quality management approach that is independent&#13;
of a speciï¬&#129;c sector. AQM planning based on an integrated approach can help generate&#13;
information on health costs related to high air pollution concentrations and the cost&#13;
of inaction in addressing air pollution, which can help clients make decisions about air&#13;
pollution control, including identiï¬&#129;cation and prioritization of cost-eï¬&#128;ective air pollu-&#13;
tion abatement interventions and determination of the sectors that must be targeted&#13;
in order to implement those interventions.&#13;
&#13;
The integrated air quality management concept is a structured approach to a continu-&#13;
ous cycle of planning, implementing, evaluating, and adjusting abatement strategies&#13;
and measures for continual improvements (see ï¬&#129;gure 4.1). The concept has been used&#13;

The IAQM approach involves four major steps:&#13;

                                                                         CONCEPT IN WORLD BANK&#13;

      sources, including stationary and non-stationary                   adopting and applying such an approach within the insti-&#13;

      abatement measures. When monitoring data are                       steps in the previous section will, based on experience,&#13;
      not available, modeling may be applied. Appendix                   require at least one or two years (World Bank 2011). The&#13;

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
This chapter provides some conclusions based on the ï¬&#129;ndings of the portfolio review&#13;
and the examination of the case studies, along with recommendations to enhance&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work in supporting countries in reducing air pollution and its associated&#13;
adverse health outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Air pollution is the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest environmental health issue.&#13;
    1. Ambient air pollution, notably ï¬&#129;ne particulate matter, accounted for 3.7 million&#13;
       deaths globally in 2012, and 88 percent of those deaths were in developing&#13;
       countries, according to the World Health Organization. Ambient air pollution&#13;
       imposes a signiï¬&#129;cant economic burden on a country and on individuals through&#13;
       its impacts on public health, reaching up to 3.2 percent of GDP in some devel-&#13;
       oping countries. Poor air quality resulting in illness, lost earnings, and increased&#13;
       medical costs can constrain productivity, which is essential for growth.&#13;
    2. Household air pollution resulted in another 4.3 million deaths globally in 2012.&#13;
       Smoke from solid fuels burned within households also contributes to ambi-&#13;
       ent air pollution. Together, household and ambient air pollution represent the&#13;
       single largest environmental health risk, responsible for 7 millionâ&#128;&#148;or one in&#13;
       eightâ&#128;&#148;deaths in 2012. They each individually cause more deaths than poor&#13;
       hygiene from inadequate water supply and sanitation. Air pollution is a major&#13;
       environmental health risk that is not currently being addressed in a systematic&#13;
       way by the Bank, and one that does not yet appear to be a high priority to&#13;
       either the Bank or its clients.&#13;
    3. Poor people disproportionately carry the economic burden associated with&#13;
       poor air quality and typically have the fewest resources to deal with its adverse&#13;
       health impacts. With continued economic growth and the rapid urbanization&#13;
       predicted in many developing countries, if the burden of air pollution is not&#13;
       addressed it will continue to grow, making it more diï¬&#131;cult for poor people to&#13;
       lead more productive lives and break out of poverty.&#13;
    4. Ambient air pollution tends to be driven by urbanization. Greater urbaniza-&#13;
       tion means more vehicles and more industrial ï¬&#129;rms in a smaller space, which&#13;
       means more emissions. However, the examples of Bangkok, Mexico City,&#13;
       and China show that improving air quality can be achieved in the face of&#13;

The concentration-response function is complicated by&#13;

            Clean air and healthy lungs : enhancing the
            World Bank's approach to air quality management
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report specifically deals with air
            pollution, which was reported, by the World Health
            Organization (WHO), as the single largest environmental
            health risk globally in 2012 (WHO, 2014a). Air pollution
            from outdoor and household sources jointly account for more
            than 7 million deaths (3.7 million from ambient air
            pollution and 4.3 million from household air pollution). The
            following sections of this chapter present the objectives
            of, and key aspects of the institutional context for, this
            report followed by an examination of some of the major
            drivers of deteriorating ambient air quality in developing
            countries; air pollution sources and impacts; and the status
            of air quality management in developing countries. Chapter
            two presents the results of a desk-based portfolio review of
            World Bank projects that are relevant to reduction of air
            pollution. This is followed, in chapter three, by an
            examination of case studies of World Bank projects whose
            objectives include addressing ambient air pollution,
            highlighting good practices and lessons for future work of
            the Bank in supporting clients. Chapter four presents
            possible approaches for enhancing future Bank support in
            helping clients to improve air quality and reduce the
            associated adverse health outcomes. Chapter five presents
            overall conclusions and recommendations.
