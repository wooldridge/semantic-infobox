&#13;
SECTIONA. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Impactof the Crisis'&#13;
&#13;
1.        The protracted and often violent struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the last 30&#13;
months'-a      struggle that has come to be known as the Second Palestinian Intifada-has                       brought the&#13;
Palestinian economic recovery that began in 1998 to an abrupt halt. The economy has shrunk by half,&#13;
with gross national income (GNI) losses exceeding US$5.4 billion (the equivalent of one year of wealth&#13;
creation), and lost investment opportunity standing at about US$3.2 billion. Real private gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) measuredat factor cost has declinedby almost 30 percent, the private sector's contribution&#13;
to the economy has declined from 88 percent in 2000 to 61 percent in 2002. Raw physical damage now&#13;
exceeds US$700million.&#13;
&#13;
2.        The movement of people and goods is severely restricted both internally and between the&#13;
Palestinians and Israeli areas, given the vast network of about 140 Israeli army check points and various&#13;
blockades. The number of Palestinians officially permitted to work in Israel has been halved to about&#13;
30,000, with much lower levels at times of severe crises, and about 172,000 jobs were lost inthe private&#13;
sector, 51percent of the pre-Zntifada workforce. Unemployment has grown from 10 percent of the labor&#13;
force in the third quarter of 2002, and now stands at 42 percent (53 percent if those not seeking work are&#13;
included).&#13;
&#13;
3.        The number of poor has tripled to more than 2 million, since about 60 percent of households have&#13;
lost more than half of their income. Families have been forced to liquidate their savings, accumulate debt,&#13;
and resort to family and other social networks as a way to cope with the crisis. The poor have been&#13;
getting even poorer, with average daily consumption slipping from US$1.47 to US$1.32 and food&#13;
consumption declining by 25 to 30 percent on a per capita basis. The incidence of acute malnutrition&#13;
among children has increased to 13.3 percent in Gaza (on par with Zimbabwe andjust behind Congo); in&#13;
the West Bank itnow stands at 4.3 percent, averaging 9.3 percent overall.&#13;
&#13;
4.        Most of the large West Bank municipalities have been re-occupied by Israeli military forces for&#13;
varying lengths of time since the end of March 2002, and have absorbed the bulk of the physical damage.&#13;
Municipalities and Village Councils (the main forms of local governance in WBG and key deliverers of&#13;
public services) have been pursuing various strategies to manage the fiscal deficit, such as reducing&#13;
services and salaries, delaying non-emergency maintenance, and laying off temporary staff. In addition,&#13;
the sheer physical difficulty    and frequent danger of delivering municipal services and maintaining basic&#13;
utilities has added an unwelcomenew dimension to a severe fiscal management problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The information on the impactof the crisis providedinthis sectionrelies heavily on two World Bank sources: "Fifieen&#13;
Months-Intifada, Closuresand Palestinian Economic Crisis," March2002; and "Two years of Intifada, Closuresand&#13;
PalestinianEconomic Crisis," February, 14,2003.&#13;
 BeginninginSeptember,2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.         Donor-funded emergency budget support has been crucial to the survival of the Palestinian&#13;
Authority (PA), and has offset the decline in domestic revenue and the withholding of Palestinian&#13;
revenues collected by the Government of Israel (GOI). Annual donor disbursements have doubled inthe&#13;
Intifada to just over US$l billion in 2002.                At US$300 per person per year, this represents an&#13;
unprecedented levelof international financial commitment.&#13;
&#13;
6.         Donors have also led the way in helping the PA to rethink and reconfigure its governance&#13;
framework, with a view to increasingefficiency and accountability. Recently, the PA adopted a serious&#13;
program of policy and institutional reform, which had been advocated by donors and the Palestinian&#13;
public for several years. The reformprogram is seen as essential to the evolution of a viable Palestinian&#13;
state, and it i s aimed at weeding out corruption by enforcing full public fiscal accountability, creating a&#13;
predictable and transparent legal environment and buildinga modem, merit-based civil service.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and SanitationSector&#13;
&#13;
7.         Background. Inrecent months, one of the most notable changes in the status of municipal and&#13;
village services in the West Bank and Gaza has been the deterioration of water services. Urban water&#13;
systems have suffered from inadequate maintenance and appreciable physical damage.3 Inrural areas, the&#13;
situation i s worse, since the population relies mostly on water transported by tankers that no longer meets&#13;
WHO drinkingwater standards, and whose price has risen substantially since September 2000 as a result&#13;
of increasedtransportation costs.&#13;
&#13;
8.         Based on a survey of 25 villages in the West Bank, Oxfam estimates that households now spend&#13;
as much as a third of their total family income on water, and points out the serious impact this has on&#13;
livelihoods, with farm animals dying and villagers being forced to sell their livestock at depreciated&#13;
prices. Recent field work, carried out by USAID4and DFID' over the past 12 months, paints a similar&#13;
picture of sharply increased water insecurity:&#13;
&#13;
       People are much poorer; many have hadno cash income since September 2000, making the purchase&#13;
       of water from vendors increasingly difficult. It i s also very difficult to obtain credit from vendors or&#13;
       through social connections.&#13;
       As a result of closures and restrictions of mobility, the cost of tanker transport has increased, making&#13;
       water more expensive and putting additional economic burden on households. Data gathered in the&#13;
       field suggestthat the price of water supplied by tanker has increased five-fold inmany villages inthe&#13;
       southern West Bank, from about NIS 4 (US$l.OO) to NIS 20 per cubic meter.&#13;
       Inaddition, waiting times for service are much longer, and water supply is erratic. Duringthe&#13;
       summer season, the period of very severe water restrictionhas increased from 2-3 months to about 5-&#13;
       6 months.&#13;
       Water supply provided to many municipalities and villages from Israeli sources i s increasingly&#13;
       erratic, due largely to discretionary and unpredictable Israelirationing and lock-offs.&#13;
       People in the smaller municipalities and villages are increasingly resorting to water sources not fit&#13;
       for human consumption, typically dirty or infestedcisterns used for watering livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Accordingto the InternationalManagementGroupdatabase, estimatedphysicaldamageto the water andwastewatersector is&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
9.          Sector Issuesand Strategy. In 2001, water supply levels on the West Bank were on average 90&#13;
I/c/d, quite low by international standards (less than one sixth of Israel's).6 Many areas of the West Bank,&#13;
Hebron and Jenin in particular, were woefully underserved and had consumption levels well below&#13;
average (see Annex 5).7 Inthe Hebron Governorate, for example, averagepiped supply was estimated at&#13;
55 Vc/d in 2001, and actual consumption about 40 I/c/d.8 Sixty percent of communities (mostly small&#13;
villages accounting for about 7 percent of the Governorate's 458,000 population) have no access to piped&#13;
supplies, and when the unserved urban population i s included, the share of Hebron's population with no&#13;
access piped supplies increases to 20 percent (about 97,000 persons). Figure 1 below indicates the&#13;
distribution of supplies and average per capita consumption levels, as well as the distribution of services&#13;
to communities ingovernorates. Furtherdetails are presented inAnnex 5.&#13;

10.        As part of the 1998-2000 Palestinian Development Plan,' the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA)&#13;
and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation identified the most pressing sector issues and&#13;
formulated an overall strategy to address them. These issues are still relevant in the current context, and&#13;
can be outlined as follows:&#13;
      Under-Znvestment: Historical under-investment in the sector has resulted in a lack of piped water to&#13;
      approximately a third of the Palestinian population in the West Bank, especially in rural areas.&#13;
      Sewage collection and treatment systems are also critically lacking throughout the Palestinian&#13;
     territories.&#13;
     Supply Constraints: Per capita availability of conventional water resources (surface water and&#13;
     groundwater) in the WBG i s very low, standing at only 103 m3/capita/year, compared to 375&#13;
     m3/capita/year in Israel; 170 m3/capita/year in Jordan; 1,200 m3/capita/year in Lebanon; and an&#13;
     average of 1,250 m3/capita/year for the whole MENAregion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

           in the West Bank and Gaza, Summary,MiddleEast andNorthAfrica Region, World Bank, January2001.&#13;
  The consumptionfigure i s net ofunaccountedfor water which PWA estimates at 40% on average. About 10percent of this&#13;
figure i s due to poor meteringandillegal connections. The balance(30%) is believedto be due to leakagesfrom old andbadly&#13;
maintained networks andbadhouseholdconnections. Actual consumptionis thus estimatedat 70percentof supply.&#13;
  Infrastructurewas a top priority in the 1999-2003 PalestinianDevelopmentPlan (January 1999), as well as the fostering of an&#13;
enablingenvironment for privatesector development. Water and wastewater are the top priorities. Inthe West Bank, emphasis is&#13;
given to drilling new wells to provide new water resources, followed by provision of water networks, sewerage collection&#13;
systems and treatment, andinstitutionalbuildingprograms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Very Low Consumption Levels: Per capita municipal (domestic and industrial) consumption i s less&#13;
   than 50 liters per day (after losses).&#13;
   High System Losses: Very high levels of losses in the West Bank (unaccounted for water (UFW)is&#13;
    around 40-50 percent) are the result of poor construction, substandard materials, the corrosive&#13;
   environment, inadequate maintenance, illegal connections, and inadequate metering.&#13;
    Contamination Threats: Natural water resources are under threat from contamination by chlorides&#13;
    (salinity), by nitrates (from sewage and agricultural fertilizers), and by other chemicals from irrigation&#13;
   drainage and industrial and municipal effluents.&#13;
   Poor Service: Intermittent service, highly variable pressure, and inadequate pressure zoning result in&#13;
   regular and severe stress on the system and frequent pipe bursts.&#13;
   Inadequate Tariffs: Tariffs are inadequateto recover costs, andrevenue collection efficiency is poor.&#13;
   Institutional Fragmentation:      Regional management of the water sector i s fragmented among&#13;
   municipal water departments, village councils, the West Bank Water Department (WBWD), and the&#13;
   Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WSSA). This fragmentation i s incompatible with efficient&#13;
   service delivery and the integrated management of the limited groundwater resources.&#13;
&#13;
11.     PWA has sought and obtained considerable technical and financial assistance from donors to&#13;
implement an overall strategy that addresses these issues. This strategy can be outlined as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   Bulk Supply Improvement: Drillingnew wells to alleviate the shortageof bulk water supplies, and&#13;
   upgrading existing wells that supply municipal water.&#13;
   Network Expansion: Extending water networks, particularly inunservedrural areas where water&#13;
   shortagesare particularly acute. This will be done incooperation with the relevant municipalities and&#13;
   village councils. Refugee camps will also receive special attention, incoordination with the United&#13;
   Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).&#13;
   SystemLoss Reduction: ReducingUFW, and thereby increasing the amount of water utilized, will&#13;
   alleviate over-extraction of groundwater aquifers (see below).&#13;
&#13;
B  Improving Network Management: Instituting measures to minimize UFW, including improving&#13;
   metering and billing, identifying illegal connections, improving leak detection and repair, and&#13;
   preparing network maps.&#13;
   Minimizing Contamination: Expanding the sewerage network will lessen contamination of&#13;
   groundwater from sewage and improve the environmental quality inurban areas.&#13;
   Establishing Policy Framework: Preparingand implementing an efficient and sustainable framework&#13;
   for systemdevelopment, buildingon the Water Law approved inFebruary of 2002.&#13;
   Tariff Reform: Institutinga system of tariffs, which will enable sustainable sector development while&#13;
   being affordable to households and vulnerable populations.&#13;
   Capacity Building: BuildingupPWA's technical, managerial and regulatory capacity.&#13;
   Institutional Reform: Undertakingmajor reforms that will separate policy and regulatory functions&#13;
   from service functions.&#13;
   Developing Regional Utilities: Entrustingwater production and distribution to regional water and&#13;
   wastewater utilities/companies, thereby reducingfragmentation and increasing efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.        Strategy Implementation. Recognizing the increasing threat to public health, the increased&#13;
economic burden on households, and the financial and operational constraints on municipalities and&#13;
villages; in April 2002, PWA established the Emergency Water Operations Center (EWOC) in close&#13;
consultation with and strong support from the donor and NGO communities. The purpose of the EWOC&#13;
i s to assist in respondingto the growing humanitarian crisis through the prompt restoration of basic water&#13;
and sanitation services inthe West Bank. Specifically, EWOCi s charged with:&#13;
&#13;
m    Maintaining daily communications with water supply officials inaffected areas.&#13;
     Coordinating damage assessments and definindprioritizing needs.&#13;
     Procuring and delivering required repair material, equipment, supplies and technical assistance.&#13;
     Organizing rapid responses to immediate water needs, including the procurement and delivery of&#13;
     emergency water supply commodities.&#13;
&#13;
13.       EWOChas functioned very well to date. Inthe first six months of operation, it disbursed about&#13;
$1.15 million for emergency repair work, managing to get most severely damaged systems up and&#13;
runningand delivering spare parts as well as emergency supplies (including bottled water). Donors have&#13;
recently made an additional US$4.4 million available to EWOC for continuing emergency work. The&#13;
focus i s now on restocking supplies, helping to improve local preparedness; and moving beyond mere&#13;
crisis management to relieving social and economic hardshipinthe worst affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
14.       The Emergency Investment Prowam (EIP).loThe West Bank has long suffered from shortages of&#13;
water, which have become increasingly acute as the conflict wears on. In response, PWA i s stressing the&#13;
need to implement a series of strategic investments on an emergency basis, and has prepared an&#13;
Emergency Investment Program that aims to boost supply by drilling and equipping wells and installing&#13;
pipelines to convey the additional water to areas of urgent need. The implementation of the program&#13;
would yield an additional 7.6 million cubic meters (MCM) of water annually, and it i s expected to&#13;
provide nearly 250,000 (14 percent) of the West Bank's 1.8 million inhabitants with an adequate and&#13;
reliable supply of water for the medium-term.&#13;
&#13;
15.       Given the restrictions currently in place on Palestinian access to the western and northeastern&#13;
aquifer systems," the program i s limited to the southern area of the West Bank, and the drilling of new&#13;
wells is restricted to the eastern aquifer. While responding to the crisis, the program aims at fully&#13;
utilizing available water rightsto the eastern aquifer as a way to reduce dependenceon the unreliablebulk&#13;
supplies provided from the Israeli network, and i s consistent with PWA's broad sector development&#13;
strategy." The programfocuses on the Hebron District, which has one of the highest poverty rates inthe&#13;
West Bank13 and, according to recent PWA data, i s not only among the worst-served areas, but also&#13;
suffers from frequent water supply rationing in the summer months -a situation greatly exacerbated by&#13;
the crisis.14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
loWest Bank IntegratedWater ResourcesManagementPlan, September2002 (fundedby USAID).&#13;
   PWA's strategy to alleviate water shortages in the northem areas is limited to continuing to provide support beyond the&#13;
emergencyneeds throughthe EWOC framework, trying to improve the efficiency of the distribution networksandincreasingthe&#13;
yield of existing wells through donor-supportedprogramof well rehabilitation. Major investments in supply augmentation are&#13;
pendingthe political resolutionof water rights and access to the westem andnortheastemaquifers. These andother issues inthe&#13;
north and central areas are being largely tackled through emergency assistance financed by donors long active in these areas,&#13;
particularlyNorway andGermany.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
16.        The EIPhas the following main components: (i)      completing the drilling and equippingof 4 wells&#13;
in Bani Na'im area; (ii)    equipping the existing East Herodian well #2; (iii)    installing five transmission&#13;
pipeline systems and related reservoirs to convey the additional water throughout the southern area of the&#13;
West Bank; and (iv) rehabilitating and extending water distribution networks for high priority&#13;
municipalities and villages that are seriously affected by water shortages. Donors have worked closely&#13;
with PWA and each other inhelping to support the investments urgently needed to ease the water supply&#13;
situation in the West Bank, making the preparation of EIPa model of donor coordination. USAID, AFD&#13;
and the Bank are committed to fundingthe implementation of the EIP.&#13;
&#13;
17.        The table below indicates the various investment packages and likely donor funding. Estimated&#13;
to cost about US$75 million, the program i s designed to allow different donors to fund various&#13;
freestanding packages in parallel. The packages proposed for World Bank funding under the EWP are a&#13;
key part of this wider donor-supported program.&#13;
&#13;
18.        Many donors including the Bank and USAlD have undertaken numerous technical, economic and&#13;
institutional studies of the area over the last few years. Thus, the foundations of the program are well&#13;
established and consistent with the broader sector strategy and the Bank's country strategy. USAID has&#13;
already funded the design of the five proposed transmission pipelines and the ongoing implementation of&#13;
the four wells and two booster stations at Bani Na'im. In addition, they have indicated an interest in&#13;
financing the implementation of the proposed West Hebron Villages carrier and the rehabilitation and&#13;
extension of the distribution networks along the carrier.           AFD has shown interest in funding the&#13;
transmission line from Halhoul to Dura and Yatta. These three sets of investment closely complement the&#13;
one identified and proposed for Bank financing. On the institutional side, USAID has already explored&#13;
the feasibility of establishing joint service councils in the area, and DFID has shown an interest in&#13;
supportingtheir implementationwithin the scope of a PWA's broader long-term strategy of establishing a&#13;
single utility for service provision inthe southern area of the West Bank.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
19.      Institutional Aspects and Sustainability. Given the conflict circumstances, PWA's current&#13;
focus has been on socio-economic hardship relief through emergency repair, increased water supplies,&#13;
and improved distribution networks in the areas of greatest need. In addition, where possible PWA i s&#13;
seeking to lay the groundwork requiredfor future sector, institutional and managerial reform.&#13;
&#13;
20.      With regards to institutions, the creation of a southern water utility operating on a commercial&#13;
basis i s a strategic objective for the sector that would ensure the sustainability of current investments in&#13;
the long-term. However, given the current conditions of protracted conflict, it i s highly unlikely that this&#13;
objective will be achieved. Discussions among donors and PWA have ledto a consensus that a system of&#13;
joint service councils i s the optimal institutional structure that will help ensure the sustainability of&#13;
investments, while serving as a first step towards the creation of the future southern utility.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Recent studies financed by donors, including USAID and DFID, have confirmed that&#13;
municipalities understand the issues and are willing to cooperate in forming such councils. The project&#13;
will provide support to PWA to enable it to effectively coordinate and collaborate with other donors inthe&#13;
creation of a framework for the development of joint service councils among the beneficiary&#13;
municipalities and villages. PWA will work in consultation with USAID and DFID who have indicated&#13;
their willingness to provide necessary technical assistance to help create local capacity to operate and&#13;
manageretail services to the consumers.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION B. BANKRESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
22.      In the absence of a CAS, on February 28, 2000 the Executive Directors approved the "Status&#13;
Report to the Board on the Trust Fundfor Gaza and West Bank and Strategic Outlook," which outlines&#13;
the Bank`s proposed strategy in WBG for the current period. The strategy aims at continuing to lay the&#13;
institutional foundation for statehood through knowledge-based analytical and policy work, and&#13;
operations that encourage the development of sound governance institutions at the central and sector&#13;
levels; and, inthe context of the current crisis, continue providing analytical and programmatic leadership&#13;
to the collective donor effort to cope with the emergency, while initiating multi-donor operations to&#13;
support the delivery of essential services and the maintenancekecovery of private sector activity.&#13;
&#13;
23.      The proposed project is focused on addressing specific, high priority issues in the water sector,&#13;
and supports the Bank's already widely respectedleadership inthe collective donor effort to findeffective&#13;
ways to assist with the most negative social and economic consequences of the crisis. In addition, the&#13;
technical assistance given to PWA will help support more effective system management at the local level&#13;
(joint service councils) and sustain the foundation for the deeper institutional reforms.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Rationalefor Bank Involvement. The Bank has hadconsiderable global experience indesigning&#13;
and implementing operations in response to natural disasters and emergencies arising in conflict-affected&#13;
settings. Developing countries are becoming increasingly aware of the need to put in place measures to&#13;
prevent or reduce risks arisingfrom crises. The number of Bank-supportedemergency recovery projects&#13;
has increased inthe past ten years, and the Bank has come a long way in its own understanding of how to&#13;
operationalize sustainable interventions inemergency situations. InWBG inparticular, the Bank i s often&#13;
relied upon by the PA and donors to lead such efforts, and has done so successfully. For example:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     The first three operations implemented by the Bank in WBG" were all emergency in nature and&#13;
     benefited from simplicity in design, while contributing toward the establishment of Palestinian&#13;
     implementation capacity, given its absence at the outset.&#13;
     The Bank has already demonstrated an ability to respond rapidly and effectively to the current crisis&#13;
     in WBG through its US$12 million contribution to the Emergency Response Program (ERSP),16&#13;
     launched in December 2000 - only two months after the start of the second Intifada - in which the&#13;
     Bank and five other donors provided over US$37 million to create temporary employment&#13;
     opportunities through small-scale infrastructure micro-projects.&#13;
     The Bank's ability to mobilize resources and contribute by providing a framework for other donor&#13;
     assistance i s illustrated by the Emergency Services Support Project (ESSP - TF-50473 - US$20&#13;
     million, FY02), which has mobilized over US$45 million indonor co-financing.&#13;
     The recently approved Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP - TF-50956 -&#13;
     US$20 million, FY03), prepared in close coordination with the European Commission and the&#13;
     Government of Belgium, among others, will leverage at its inception over US$37 million in parallel&#13;
     financing. Additional donor co-financing i s expected to follow once the proposed Municipal Fundi s&#13;
     established."&#13;
     The Bank`s Country Office has a comparative advantage by virtue of its highly skilled and&#13;
     experienced national and international staff, who can effectively administer and supervise emergency&#13;
     programs inthe West Bank and Gaza.&#13;
     Through its various water studies and projects in WBG over the last 8 years, the Bank has gained a&#13;
     deep knowledge and understanding of the sector and demonstrated considerable practical and&#13;
     intellectual leadership. It has also built a strong relationship with PWA and other key donors in the&#13;
     sector. Thus, PWA and donors expect the Bankto play a leading role intimes such as these.&#13;
     Finally, the Bank`s comparative advantage and global experience, has been instrumental in&#13;
     implementing innovative institutionalreforms inthe sector pioneered under the Water and Sanitation&#13;
     Services Project (WSSP - TF-26056 - US$25 million, FY97) and the Southern Area and Sanitation&#13;
     Improvement Project (SAWSIP -TF-22443 -US$21 million, FY00).18&#13;
&#13;
25.       Lessons Learned from Similar Operations.                          An important lesson learned from recent&#13;
emergency operations in WBG supported by the Bank relates to decentralization of project preparation&#13;
and implementation, which greatly facilitates implementation at a time when central systems are unable to&#13;
function effectively because of the security situation. Decentralization has worked well in all of the&#13;
Bank-supported emergency projects inWBG.&#13;

   EMRSPis amunicipalinstrument,and does not address deeper supply and distribution problems in the water sector-at      least,&#13;
not inthe short run.&#13;
'*The  key institutionalreformcomponentof SAWSIPwas restructuredrecently inresponsethe terminationof the contractwith&#13;
the internationaloperatoron grounds offorce majeure. Both actions were directly due to the current crisis. Giventhe&#13;
circumstances,it is highly unlikely that the strategic objectivesfor the creationof the southemwater utility canbecomeareality&#13;
inthe short-term. Duringthisperiodofinstability, the focus will beplacedinaddressingthe pressingneedsto supply additional&#13;
water while pursuingthe modestobjectiveof establishingjoint service councils, which would be astepping-stonefor the creation&#13;
of the future southernutility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26.      In addition, water is one of the few sectors in WBG where dialogue and reasonable working&#13;
relationships still persist among the professionals on the Palestinian and Israeli sides, and where&#13;
considerable donor involvement has also facilitated the dialogue between the Palestinian and Israeli&#13;
parties. There appears to be a higher-level consensus that issues related to the management of scarce&#13;
water resources, and the health risks attached to a breakdown in water and sanitation systems are too&#13;
important to be left to the vagaries of the current crisis. Consultative mechanisms such as the Joint Water&#13;
Committee (JWC) bringtogether Israeli and Palestinian professionals (including the military) periodically&#13;
to discuss sector issues. These mechanisms are working and have proved effective in sorting out many&#13;
problems. For example, upon consultation in a number of cases including the ongoing SAWSIP, Israeli&#13;
military authorities have given special permits to a number of contractors and consultants in order to&#13;
facilitate the movement of construction equipment and workers.&#13;
&#13;
27.      The situation favors the operation of international contractors, who are able to expedite the&#13;
process of obtaining the necessary permits and clearances. However, there is a risk that key expatriate&#13;
staff may depart quickly when serious conflicts materialize.&#13;
&#13;
28.      The above implies i s that PWA must continue to deepen the dialogue with relevant Israeli&#13;
technical, political and military authorities, keeping them fully apprised of plans and alerting them&#13;
promptly when problems arise. Existing consultative mechanisms must be utilized effectively, and&#13;
project design, management and procurement strategies must exploit, or at least take heed of the factors&#13;
that foster success in the current context. Finally, contingency plans must be developed to deal with the&#13;
various crises and blockages that may arise.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION C. DETAILED        PROJECT   DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
Objectives and Components&#13;
&#13;
29.      Project Objectives and Development Outcomes. The main objective of the proposed project is&#13;
to help alleviate the chronic shortages of safe water supplies, and reduce system losses, water costs and&#13;
health risks. These objectives are consistent with PWA's strategy, in which highest priority i s given to&#13;
developing existing sources where water can be quickly conveyed and distributed to underserved&#13;
consumers.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Project Components and Estimated Costs. The proposed project is a self-standing portion of a&#13;
broader, coordinated donor-supported program.lg It is estimated to cost US$13.4 million (IDA, US$12.50&#13;
million and the PA, US$O.9 million inthe form of payment of taxes), and will be implemented over a two&#13;
and a half year period. It will be entirely financed on a grant basis from TFGWB, and includes the&#13;
following main components: (i)rehabilitation and improvement of water supply transmission and&#13;
distribution systems; and (ii)technical assistanceand capacity building, as further detailed below.&#13;
&#13;

million).&#13;
&#13;
    Package #I.East Herodian Well Equipment and Transmission Pipeline (US$4.5million).&#13;
&#13;
    This sub-component will finance: a) the supply and installation of electromechanical works for&#13;
    the existing East Herodian water well number two (EH#2), including well pump, booster pump&#13;
    and accessories, at an estimated cost of US$2.0 million; and b) the supply and installation of&#13;
    about 7.5 km of 16-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission pipeline to convey the water&#13;
    from EH#2 to the existing main north-south carrier at an estimated cost of US$2.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
    Once operational, the well will discharge an additional 200m3/hr. EH#2 was drilled and tested in&#13;
    the second half of year 2000, just before the Intifada started. The cost of drilling was borne by&#13;
    EIB. The design and preparation of biddingdocuments for the two packages was prepared by an&#13;
    international consulting firm, and was financed by U S A D .&#13;

    This sub-component will finance the installation of about 15kmof 6 to 16-inch diameter ductile&#13;
    iron water transmission pipeline from the existing Halhoul regional water reservoir (capacity&#13;
    25,000m3, financed by USAID) to Kharas and Nuba villages.&#13;
&#13;
    The work includes construction of a l,000m3on-ground water reservoir near Kharas and the&#13;
    connection pipelines to the proposed main pipeline, which will replace an old and much smaller&#13;
    (6-inch diameter) transmission pipeline, and convey water supplied from the north-south carrier&#13;
    (mentioned in package #1 above) through the existing Halhoul reservoir to the western villages.&#13;
    Special mitigation measures, such as the use of reducers and pressure reducing valves, are&#13;
    planned in case the proposed (12-inch diameter segment) transmission pipeline needs to be&#13;
    connected to the existing 6-inch diameter pipeline near Nuba village. This would be the case if&#13;
    the complementary investment package (# 1)of USAID outlined inthe section below, i s delayed.&#13;
&#13;
    The entire additional amount of 1.7 M C Mfrom EH#2would be transferred to the western Hebron&#13;
    villages via the new pipeline, as well as a share of the 5.9 M C M proposed from the USAID&#13;
    developed Bani Na'im well field (see complementary investment package #2 below).&#13;
&#13;
    Pkg. #3, Distribution Network Rehabilitation Package (US$2.5million).&#13;
&#13;
    This sub-component will finance the rehabilitation of existing water networks in the villages of&#13;
    Kharas (about 34km of different diameter pipes) and Nuba (about 34km of different diameter&#13;
    pipes), and will be supported by complementary investment package#3 (see below).&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Technical Assistance and CapacityBuilding (US$2.0million).&#13;
&#13;
   Project Management Unit (PMU)(US$0.5million).&#13;
&#13;
   This sub-component will finance the strengthening of the existing Project Management Unit&#13;
    (PMU) within PWA to enable it to effectively supervise project execution, and collaborate with&#13;
    other donors inthe creation of a framework for the development ofjoint services council clusters,&#13;
   that will be responsible for operating and maintaining retail water distribution throughout the&#13;
   project area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       The project will finance a share of the PMU's operating costs, including office supplies, utility&#13;
       costs, rent, communication costs, local travel, office equipment and furniture, as well as rent for&#13;
       storage facilities and insurance.&#13;
&#13;
       The PMU will operate throughout the duration of the Project and will have the principal&#13;
       implementation responsibility on PWA's behalf. It i s already in place, and, during appraisal, its&#13;
       capacity and adequacy for the proposed project was reviewed and deemed acceptable. The&#13;
       recruitment of a project manager(s) and a procurement officer would further strengthen it.&#13;
&#13;
       Technical assistance: (US$1.5million).&#13;
&#13;
       This sub-component will finance: a) the costs of the consultant services necessary for technical&#13;
       support, monitoring, engineering design, and preparation of bidding documents for Dura and&#13;
       Yatta villages distribution networks; and b) the cost of services of a Construction Management&#13;
       firm.&#13;
&#13;
31.    Complementary Investments: These would be undertaken in parallel, but independently, by&#13;
USAID and AFD as part of the EIP. They include the following:&#13;
&#13;
   Complementary Investment # 1: Works-Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Supply and&#13;
   Distribution System. (US$61.5million).&#13;
&#13;
   Complementary Package # I: Westem Villages Transmission Line (US$12 million, financed bv&#13;
   USAID).&#13;
&#13;
   The supply and installation of the remaining length, about 28km of ductile iron pipes, of the&#13;
   transmission pipeline, namely from Nuba to Al-Bira in the southern part of Hebron. The work also&#13;
   includes construction of four 500m3ground water reservoirs near the Beit Ula, Deir Samit, Iskeik and&#13;
   AI-Bira villages and the connection pipelines to the maintransmission pipeline.&#13;
&#13;
   Complementaw Package # 2: Bani Na'im bulk water supply and transmission pipe1ine package:&#13;
   (US$29million, financed by USAID).&#13;
&#13;
   The supply and installation of electromechanical works for the existing Bani Na'im water well field&#13;
   including well pumps, two booster stations, the piping system within the well field up to the&#13;
   downstream booster station, and the water carriers from the downstream booster station to both the&#13;
   existing Halhoul reservoir and to Yatta reservoir. The well field, once operational, would discharge&#13;
   about 5.8 MCM of water based on a 675m3/hr discharge rate into the water system. Three wells of&#13;
   the water well field were completely drilled and the forth i s under drilling. The drilling of one of the&#13;
   wells was financed by the EIB and drilling the other three wells are financed by the USAID. An&#13;
   international consulting fm has been contracted to finalize the design, and it i s expected that&#13;
   contactingfor the implementationwould start inthe fourth quarter of 2003.&#13;
&#13;
   Complementary Package # 3: Westem Villages Network Rehabilitation (US$14 million, financed bv&#13;
   USAID)&#13;
&#13;
   The rehabilitation of existing or installation of new water distribution networks in several villages&#13;
   locatedaround the main transmission pipeline fromNuba village to AI-Bira.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Complementary Packane # 4: Halhoul-Hebron-Dura-Yatta transmission pipelines: (US$6.5 million,&#13;
    financed bv AFD).&#13;
&#13;
     The supply and installation of about 23km of 24-inch diameter ductile iron/steel water transmission&#13;
     pipeline from the existing Halhoul regional water reservoir to Dura and Yatta villages. The work also&#13;
     includes construction of a 5,000m3 on-ground water reservoir near Dura village and the connection&#13;
    pipelines to the proposed 24-inch diameter pipeline.&#13;

Major Benefits and Risks&#13;
&#13;
33.      Benefits. The main benefit of the program and the project is improved water supply to an&#13;
estimated 400,000 people in the Hebron Governorate through the program and 90,000 people in the&#13;
Western Hebron villages through the project. Improved water supply translates into various non-&#13;
monetary and monetary benefits, such as: (i)   improved health and hygiene through higher quantities and&#13;
better quality of water; and (ii)reduced expenditures for buying water from water vendors. The Western&#13;
Hebron villages households currently receive only a limited average amount of about 60 liters per capita&#13;
per day (Vc/d) from the following sources: 34 Yc/d through the network; 17 Vc/d from rainwater&#13;
harvesting and 9 Vc/d from water vendors. This already very low figure masks substantial local and&#13;
seasonal variations. The price of water charged by vendors - NIS 20 per m3(US$4.3 per m3)- i s one of&#13;
the highest inthe world, and about four times higher than the average tariff of piped water inthe Southern&#13;
West Bank the highest in the ME"region (NIS 5 per m3or US$1.18 per m3),and mainly attributed to&#13;
water scarcity and movement restrictions.&#13;
&#13;
34.      It is assumed that water use from the network will double to about 70 l/c/d, displacing water&#13;
supplied by vendors, while the amount of harvested rainwater will remain the same at 17 Wd. Based on&#13;
these data, the shadow price of the incremental amounts of water i s estimated at more than US$2 per m3&#13;
for the Western villages. Assuming the data for the Western villages are representative for the whole&#13;
Hebron Governorate, the economic rate of return of the program i s estimated at 21%. If the Bani Na'im&#13;
well field and associated transmission as well as the Halhoul-Dura pipeline are excluded, thus including&#13;
only the investments destined to the Western villages, the rate of return drops to 10%.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Risks. The project faces significant risks during implementation. In general, there i s a risk that&#13;
the volatile political and security situation could jeopardize smooth implementation, particularly if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2o SeeAnnex 3 for ProjectLogframe with key performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
closures and curfews remain in place for an indefinite period. This risk i s widely acknowledged by the&#13;
donor community and i s addressedinpart through the Task Force on Implementation. The fact that three&#13;
donors are participating ina coordinated effort will help to ensure a hearingwith Israeli Authorities when&#13;
problems arise as a result of their actions.&#13;
&#13;
36.      The following specific risks have been identifiedalong with measuresto mitigate their impact:&#13;
&#13;
    Low Well Yield. There i s a risk of the EH#2 well yielding less than the necessary200 cubic meters per&#13;
    hour (CMPH) of water of acceptable quality. Test results have confirmed that the required quantity&#13;
    and quality of water i s obtainable from the well.&#13;
    Procurement: To further minimize potential risks during the implementation phase, the contracting&#13;
    will be done separately for equipping the EH#2 well, the goods needed for the two pipelines, the&#13;
    works related to the installation of the pipelines, and the rehabilitation works for the villages of&#13;
    Kharas and Nuba. The equipping of the EH#2 well and goods will be tendered and awarded using&#13;
    International Competitive Bidding(ICB) procedures, usingthe standard biddingdocuments for supply&#13;
    and installation of equipment, as well as the standard bid evaluation report for goods and works.&#13;
    PWA will be assistedby an international consultingfirm inpreparingthese documents in accordance&#13;
    with Bank procurement guidelines. National Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures will be used for&#13;
    the installation of the pipelines and rehabilitation of the village networks. The risks of 'increased&#13;
    complexity of supervision associated with this approach are mitigated by the employment of an&#13;
    experienced, internationally recruitedconstruction manager.&#13;
    Delays infinalizing bidding documents: PWA will prepare the biddingdocuments inaccordance with&#13;
    the World Bank procurement guidelines.           The designs for the EH#2 well pumping station and&#13;
    transmission pipeline are complete, while the detailed designs for the Halhoul-Kharas-Nuba pipeline&#13;
    and reservoir package are well underway. The tender documents for the procurement of goods and&#13;
    equipment neededfor implementation have been issued for Bank' s review.&#13;
    Zsraeli Permissions:PWA has secured written confirmation from the Joint Water Committee and the&#13;
    Israeli authorities indicating their willingness to facilitate the movement of the contractors and goods&#13;
    to and from the project sites.&#13;
    Project Management: Although the PMUi s competent, it also has many other responsibilities. Thus&#13;
    further local technical expertise (project manager and procurement specialist) and, as noted above, an&#13;
    internationally recruited construction manager will be employed under the project to help oversee&#13;
    progress and manage the procurement issues that could arise.&#13;
    Donor Coordination: The proposed project is part of a wider program of relief and improvement for&#13;
    the southern West Bank, and has been developed in coordination with other donors, who are expected&#13;
    to be working inparallel. Delays in the implementation of other donor-financedcomponents i s a risk&#13;
    that i s mitigated by the project's freestanding design.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Current Bank experience indicates that projects can be implemented even under the very difficult&#13;
circumstances that exist today. Nonetheless, there i s the possibility of further serious deterioration in the&#13;
political and security conditions, to the point where extended border closures might halt delivery of&#13;
material and supplies for long periods or force the evacuation of the contractor's staff. Short of such&#13;
situation, though, the PMU has demonstrated its ability to cope with and adjust to the current conditions,&#13;
and it has reaffirmed their strong commitment to continued timely implementation. Should the worse&#13;
case scenario materialize, prior PWA consultation with Israeli authorities may minimize the overall&#13;
impact of such circumstances. In any case, local contractors should be capable of completing the work;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
therefore, foreign contractors will be required to ensure that their local subcontractors are fully involved&#13;
inand conversant withproject details.&#13;
&#13;
38.     Environmental Aspects. The proposed emergency project was prepared in accordance with&#13;
Operational Policy (OP) 8.50 and will contribute to environmental improvements by increasing water&#13;
service quality and coverage in small localities inthe southern partof the West Bank. The identified sub-&#13;
projects will not require land acquisition or resettlement; thus, the project has been deemed category B in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998).                  An Environmental&#13;
Management Plan (EMP) was prepared by PWA in close coordination with the Environmental Quality&#13;
Authority (EQA) and will be monitored through Bank supervision missions and reviewed during the&#13;
project's mid-term review. The EMP gives general guidance on environmental issues, as well as on site&#13;
assessments and designs that will be prepared for infrastructure sub-projects to be carried out under this&#13;
project. In addition, the EMP elaborates on potential environmental impacts and recommends mitigation&#13;
measures, for which the needs are likely to be limited. The costs, if any, would be borne under the&#13;
rehabilitationand improvement component of the project.&#13;
&#13;
39.     Social Aspects. The key social and economic impacts are indicated in the section on benefits&#13;
below. However, it should be noted that these impacts will be positive and considerable. In particular,&#13;
the project would reduce hardship by increasing safe and reliable supply of water. Public healthrisks will&#13;
also decrease, since there will be a reduction on the dependence on unsafe supplies of water. Reduced&#13;
water costs will help households deal with the very difficult economic conditions, particularly for those&#13;
already below the poverty line. Women, children and the disadvantaged will benefit significantly, since&#13;
they bear the main burden of water collection and household chores. Given that the proposed pipelines&#13;
will be laid or rehabilitated along existing public right-of-ways, there are no relocation issues, and no&#13;
indigenous communities will be affected.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION D. STUDIES &amp; TECHNICAL          ASSISTANCE&#13;
&#13;
40.     The project will provide support to PWA to enable it to effectively coordinate and collaborate&#13;
with other donors inthe creation of a framework for the development ofjoint service councils among the&#13;
beneficiary municipalities and villages, as a first step towards the creation of a regional utility. Recent&#13;
studies financed by donors, including USAID and DFID, have confirmed that municipalities understand&#13;
the issues and are willing to cooperate in forming such councils. PWA will work in consultation with&#13;
USAID and DFJDwho have indicated their willingness to provide necessary technical assistance to help&#13;
create local capacity to operate and manage retail services to the consumers, given their experience in&#13;
forming JSCs in the southern area of the West Bank. In addition, the project will finance technical&#13;
assistanceto the PMU, as detailedinthe Component 2 section above.&#13;
&#13;
SECTION E. INSTITUTIONAL       ARRANGEMENTS &amp; PROJECT          IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
41.     Currently the Palestinian entities whose mandates directly affect the water sector are: (i)      the&#13;
National Water Council (NWC) chaired by the President of the Palestinian Authority and composed of 13&#13;
members representing public and private sectors; (ii)   the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), and (iii)&#13;
various water utilities and municipalities covering different areas of the West Bank and Gaza. PWA has&#13;
overall regulatory responsibility for the sector and provides policy guidance and support, as well as&#13;
coordinates the work of donors active inthe sector.&#13;
&#13;
42.     Project Management Unit. Day-to-day implementation will be the responsibility of the&#13;
PWA's existing PMU. The latter was established by the PWA to facilitate effective monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation of SAWSIP.21 The PMU is located in Bethlehem city in the southern part of the West&#13;
Bank close to the project site, and will be strengthenedby recruiting a project manager(s), a procurement&#13;
officer, and a construction manager (a firm), all according to Bank guidelines for selection and&#13;
employment of consultants. The procurement officer will be responsible for procurement related issues&#13;
for both the proposed project and the SAWSIP. Preferably, the construction manager will be a qualified&#13;
international firm responsible for facilitating the coordination with Israelis for: clearance of entry of&#13;
goods and securing permits for mobility of staff and contractors' employees, in addition to managing the&#13;
construction of the investment packages.&#13;
&#13;
43.      The PMUwill be responsible for all project accounting, disbursement, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
and will ensure timely implementation of Project activities. It will also be responsible for the selection&#13;
and employment of consultants and preparation of contracts for the locab'international technical&#13;
consulting firmskonsultants, as well as procurement of works, goods and services. The PMU will be&#13;
requiredto submit quarterly progress reports for IDA review, which cover the status of physical progress&#13;
in implementing the various investment packages; updated commitment/disbursement data and variation&#13;
orders, noting deviations, if any, from the implementation plan; and highlight key issues and constraints,&#13;
mitigation measures planned and taken; and updated assessments of the quality and coverage of water&#13;
service delivery inthe benefited communities. The PMUwill also prepare a detailed mid-term report that&#13;
would serve as the basis for a Project Mid-Term Review inJanuary 2005. Finally, PMUwill prepare and&#13;
submit an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to IDA within four months of the project's closing&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
44.      Project ImplementationPlan (PIP). A draft Project Implementation Plan was prepared by&#13;
PWA anddiscussed and agreed at appraisal. Its purpose is to detail how the PalestinianAuthority intends&#13;
to carry out the Project to its completion. The PIP complements the MOP and Technical Annex; it&#13;
expands on important implementation arrangements, and is seen by PWA as a flexible implementation&#13;
tool that would be reviewed periodically and adjusted when warranted. The PIP describes PWA as the&#13;
focal point, fully accountable for Project oversight and coordination. Staffing and key staff positions for&#13;
the PMU involved in implementation are also described in the PIP, as well as the role of the other&#13;
participants in the process (PMU, construction manager and various ministries and donors), and the&#13;
coordinationmechanisms between the various actors.&#13;
&#13;
45.      There will be a Project Launch Workshop within one month of effectiveness. Part of the Bank&#13;
supervision staff i s located inthe field for close monitoring of the Project and to provide timely assistance&#13;
to the client. Supervision missions would take place according to Project requirements. The Project&#13;
midterm review i s tentatively scheduled for January 2005. The penultimate supervision mission&#13;
(February-March 2006) would be usedto launchthe preparationof the ICR with PWA.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
46.      The Project will finance civil works, goods, services, and operating costs. Procurement will be&#13;
conducted in accordance with IDA guidelines for "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,"&#13;
January 1995 (revised inJanuary and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999); as well as those&#13;
for "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997 (revised&#13;
September 1997 and January 1999, revised May 2002). The components not financed by IDA will be&#13;
procured in accordance with PA regulations or guidelines of financing institutions.                  A General&#13;
Procurement Notice (GPN) has already been issued in "United Nations Development Business" (UNDB)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21After the termination of the operator contract, the PMUplayed a more active role inthe implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prior to the publication of the first Specific Procurement Notice (SPN) and bidders who have expressed&#13;
interest will be notifieddirectly by the PMU.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Procurement Responsibilities. The PMUwill bear overall procurement responsibility duringall&#13;
phases of the project. All contracts, purchase orders and bid evaluation reports will be retainedand filed&#13;
at the PMUoffice.&#13;
&#13;
48.      Procurement Methods. The procurement arrangements described below are summarized under&#13;
Table A. Thresholds for procurement methods and prior review arrangements are summarized under&#13;
Table B.&#13;
&#13;
49.      Civil Works. Civil works are not expected to be procured under ICB procedures. Due to the&#13;
current situation of political volatility and the restrictive and difficult security measures in place, it i s&#13;
unlikely that international contractors will be interested in working inthe sub-project areas. Bidpackages&#13;
with an estimated contract value of US$2,000,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount of US$5,000,000,&#13;
will be procured using NCB procedures and documents, and advertised in at least two local newspapers.&#13;
NCB contracts will be open to eligible foreign bidders ifthey wish to participate. Bidevaluations will be&#13;
submitted on IDA's Standard BidEvaluationForms for Procurement of Goods and Works of April 1996.&#13;
&#13;
50.      Goods. To the extent possible, goods will be grouped together in lots of similar items. Bid&#13;
packages with an estimated contract value of more than US$200,000 equivalent will be procured using&#13;
ICB procedures. Packages with an estimated contract value of US$lOO,OOO or more up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$400,000 or equivalent will be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures and documents acceptable to the Bank. These contracts will require advertisement in at least&#13;
two local newspapers. NCB contracts will be open to eligible foreign bidders if they wish to participate.&#13;
Goods contracts estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO up to an aggregate amount of US$lOO,OOO will&#13;
be procured using National or International Shopping (NS/IS) procedures and will require soliciting,&#13;
receiving and evaluating competitive quotations from at least three qualified suppliers. Goods costing&#13;
less than US$5,000 with IDA prior review and clearance, and under exceptional circumstances, will be&#13;
procuredthrough direct purchase from the nearest available source.&#13;
&#13;
51.     Services. For consultants' services costing US$200,000 or more, the Quality and Cost Based&#13;
Selection (QCBS) method will be used. Inaddition, the Least Cost Based Selection (LCBS) method will&#13;
be used for the procurement of the construction manager contract. An advertisement for Expressions of&#13;
Interest will be published in the UN Development Business and the use of IDA's Standard RFT and&#13;
EvaluationReport will be required. For services costing less than US$200,000 up to an aggregateamount&#13;
of US$500,000, the selection method would be QCBS or QBS. For services provided by firms costing&#13;
less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000, the selection method will be&#13;
Consultants' Qualifications (CQ).       Single Source Selection (SS) will be used under exceptional&#13;
circumstances and would require IDA's prior review and `no objection.'&#13;
&#13;
52.     For individual consultant contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or less, the selection method will&#13;
be based on Section V of the World Bank Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers, published in January 1997 and revised in September 1997, January 1999, and&#13;
May 2002. Single Source Selection (SS) will be used under exceptionalcircumstances and would require&#13;
IDA's prior review and `no objection'.&#13;

53.      Prior Review. (Table 2-B provides information on all prior review arrangements). The first two&#13;
contract packages in each category and each procurement method (works, goods and services),&#13;
irrespective of the estimated contract value, would be subject to IDA's prior review, in accordance with&#13;
the applicable guidelines. Thereafter, all contracts for works with an estimated contract value above&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent, any contract for goods with an estimated contract value above US$lOO,OOO&#13;
equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review. Contracts with individual consultants in excess of&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent and with consulting f m s in excess of US$lOO,OOO equivalent, as well as all&#13;
single-source contracts would be subject to prior review. All other contracts would be subject to post-&#13;
review on arandombasisduring supervisionmissionsandprocurementaudits.&#13;
&#13;
Total value of contracts subjectto prior review: US$12.4 million.&#13;

54.      Overall Procurement Risk Assessment: Average.&#13;
&#13;
55.      Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: One every six months (including&#13;
special procurement supervision for post-reviewlaudits). Post review will be conducted on a sample of 10&#13;
percent of the sub-projects subject to post review.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Procurement Planning. The PMUhas prepared a draft procurement plan for the main project&#13;
activities. The plan would be revised on a quarterly basis and will be part of the project implementation&#13;
plan.&#13;
&#13;
57.      Summary of Procurement Capacity Assessment. Since it was established, PWA has been&#13;
working bilaterally with a number of donor countries and international agencies including the Bank. It&#13;
has capable and experienced staff that have carried out and performed procurement processes in&#13;
accordance with different donor rules and regulations.       PWA has previous experience with Bank&#13;
guidelines through the MIDP I,MIDP 11, Gaza Water Supply and Sanitation Project and the Southern&#13;
Area Water and Sanitation Improvement Project.         The PMU has previous experience with Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines through the ongoing Southern Area Water and Sanitation Improvement Project.&#13;
However, hiringa procurement specialist would strengthen the PMU. Inaddition, PWA will be assisted&#13;
by a management construction firminthe preparation of the biddingdocuments in accordance with Bank&#13;
procedures and guidelines, as well as duringsupervision of the construction works.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
58.      Background: The Palestinian Water Authority, through the existing Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) in West Bank for the on-going SAWSIP, will have the responsibility for the project&#13;
implementation, as well as all aspects of financial management. The PMUwas established in 1999 and&#13;
has beenresponsible for SAWSIP's overall financial management, includingaccounting, monitoring, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reporting throughout the project implementation. The financial management system (FMS) at the PMUi s&#13;
continuously reviewed duringthe Bank`s regular supervision missions to ensure continuation of adequate&#13;
financial management arrangements and the ability to generate reliable quarterly financial monitoring&#13;
reports (FMR). Throughout the implementationof SAWSIP, the PMUmaintained an adequate FMS.&#13;
&#13;
59.      The PMU i s adequately staffed with a qualified finance officer. The PMUwill prepare a full set&#13;
of FMR on quarterly basis and submit them un-audited to IDA within 45 days from the end of each&#13;
quarter. Also, the PMU will prepare annual financial statements, which will be audited by a qualified&#13;
independent auditor acceptableto IDA. The audit report shall be sent to IDA within four months of year-&#13;
end. Disbursement will be based on traditional disbursement methods. To facilitate implementation, a&#13;
SpecialAccount will be openedat commercialbank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
60.      Financial Management Assessment: The financial management assessment of the PMU,&#13;
conducted during a February 2003 supervision mission, revealed that it has in place adequate financial&#13;
management systems that meet the IDA requirements. The operational procedural manual provides&#13;
adequate level of segregation of duties and clear division of authorities and responsibilities. Also, the FM&#13;
system i s capable of producingreliable and timely project financial statements and FMR.&#13;
&#13;
61.      Accounting System: The project's primary accounting will be the responsibility of the PMU.&#13;
Separate project ledger and accounting records would be established for EWP, as the PMU's accounting&#13;
system (Bisan) is capable of maintaining multi-project accounts. The PMU accounting responsibilities&#13;
will include maintaining all accounting records, supporting documents, undertake book-keeping of all&#13;
financial transactions, prepare monthly bank reconciliation for the Special Account, quarterly FMR,&#13;
prepare annual financial statements, examine supporting documents for the purpose of payments to&#13;
contractors and third parties, prepare Withdrawal Applications for withdrawal of funds from the Grant&#13;
Account and coordinate with the Ministry of Finance for countersignature, review and monitoring&#13;
purposes. Accounting for the project will be on accrual basis in line with International Accounting&#13;
Standards and PWA accounting policies and procedures. This implies that year-end adjustments for&#13;
accounts payable and accountsreceivable will be properly made.&#13;
&#13;
62.      The PMUwill maintain supporting documentation for expenditures on activities managed under&#13;
the Project. Books of accounts will be maintained on double-entry bookkeeping principles for the&#13;
activities under the Project. Project records should be kept in auditable conditions at all times. The&#13;
project accounting records and all supporting documents shall be maintained at PWA for at least one year&#13;
after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Grant&#13;
Account was made.&#13;
&#13;
63.      Budgeting System: The budgeting system is in place and linked to accounting. The PMU will&#13;
prepare an annual budget plan and update it on quarterly basis to reflect actual implementation and latest&#13;
forecasts. Where feasible, the PMU proposals for funding will be accompanied by a proposed budget,&#13;
which would facilitate better planning and control. These plans will be periodically reviewed and updated&#13;
along with the progress of the project.&#13;
&#13;
64.      Procedures of Internal Control: The Internal Control Procedures at the PMUwere established&#13;
in 1999by qualifiedconsultants, and are acceptableto IDA. The control policies andprocedures provide&#13;
reasonable assurance of (a) a proper authorization of transactions; (b) access to and use of assets and&#13;
records; and (c) separation of custody of cash from authorization and record keeping, and separation of&#13;
authorizationfrom record keeping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65.      Flow of Funds: The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will establish a special account at a commercial&#13;
bank according to IDA's terms and conditions. The PMU will be responsible for managing the Special&#13;
Account, including preparation of withdrawal applications and sending copies to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
for review, countersignature and monitoring purposes, reconciliation of the account to IDA's records,&#13;
cooperate with IDA's supervision missions and coordinate with external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
66.      The Bank will finance 95 percent of the eligible consulting services excluding VAT (81percent if&#13;
VAT is included); 100percent of the eligible foreign expenditures for goods; and 85 percent of eligible&#13;
expenditures for works and local goods. The remainingpercentage, which accounts for VAT, will be pre-&#13;
financed by a VAT fund account established by PWA and replenished by the MOF as they collect the&#13;
VAT payments from the contractors, and no later than 60 days after the payment has been made to the&#13;
contractors. Disbursement will be based on traditional disbursement methods, using applications for&#13;
direct payment, requests for special commitments, reimbursement, and replenishments to the Special&#13;
Account accompanied by SOEs andor summary sheets with full supporting documents. The PMU/MA&#13;
will maintain all supporting documents for year-end auditing and supervision missions reviews, these&#13;
documents will be kept at PWA for at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal&#13;
year inwhich the last withdrawal from the Grant Account was made.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR): The PMU will prepare Financial Management Reports&#13;
and send them non-audited to the Bank 45 days following the end of every quarter. The Financial&#13;
Management Reports will include (a) a general progress report about Project implementation (b) the cost&#13;
by component for the quarter (c) the costs incurred by type of expenses (d) the project balance sheet and&#13;
(e) the acquisitions incurred on contracts under the established threshold. The project statement of&#13;
accounts will be put in place to facilitate the automatic generation of the reports on financial controls.&#13;
The contents and format of the reports have been prepared by the PMU and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
The FMR will be reviewed by the project team and the financial management analyst in the Country&#13;
Office, and will form the basis for the Country Office periodic review of the project's financial&#13;
management activities.&#13;
&#13;
68.     Audit: The project accounts and the annual financial statements (project balance sheet, the flow&#13;
of funds, and the statement of the Special Account) will be subjected to annual audits. The audit will be&#13;
conducted in accordance to international standards on auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to&#13;
IDA, and under terms of reference cleared by IDA. The auditor will examine all sources of the funds of&#13;
the project, as well as all incurred expenses including those related to the statements of the expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) by ascertaining their conformity with the Trust FundGrant Agreement. The auditor will express&#13;
an opinion on the project financial statements, and will supply a separated viewpoint on the eligibility of&#13;
all incurred expenses that are included in the SOEs. The audit report should be sent to IDA not later than&#13;
four months after the end of the year. The auditor will be appointed by MOF.&#13;
&#13;
69.     In addition to external auditing, SOEs will be reviewed by supervision missions and IDA's&#13;
country office to substantiate adequate supporting documents and accuracy, and to ensure consistent and&#13;
efficient applicationof the financial management system.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Risks: The project's financial management risk is considered low. This consideration is mainly&#13;
the result of the following: (a) financial management i s entrusted to an experienced, well established&#13;
PMU, (b) limited number of transactions with relatively large amounts which require intensive review&#13;
and auditing, and (c) involvement of the Ministry of Finance in reviewing and countersigning each&#13;
withdrawal application. The mainrisk would be the co-mingling of the two projects accounts handledby&#13;
the same PMU(SAWSIP and EWP), or errors in posting payments between the two projects. This risk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will be mitigatedthrough the set up of separate accounts and general ledger, and maintainingthe financial&#13;
transaction records totally separate.&#13;
&#13;
71.     In addition to the regular supervision missions, the financial management analyst at the Country&#13;
Office would review the quarterly FMR, periodically review SOE samples, conduct visits to the PMUand&#13;
ensure the sustainability and adequacy of the FMarrangements .&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
72.     Disbursements would follow traditional disbursement methods using applications for direct&#13;
payment, requests for special commitments, reimbursement and replenishments to the Special Account&#13;
accompanied by SOEs and/or summary sheets with full supporting documents.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Disbursement Arrangements. The proposed Grant of US$12.5 million equivalent will be&#13;
disbursed over a period starting August 1, 2003 and up to the closing date of June 30, 2006. Table C&#13;
below describes the allocation of the Grant proceeds accordingto each expenditure category. Retroactive&#13;
financing would be available for eligible expenditures incurred after May 31, 2003, up to a maximumof&#13;
US$0.5 million equivalent.&#13;

equivalent of $50,000 for services of individual consultants. Disbursement for all other expenditures will&#13;
be made against SOEs with supporting documentation retained at the PMUpremises and made available&#13;
for IDA'Sreview during supervision. SOEs will be subject to an annual audit and semi-annual review by&#13;
an independent auditor, as well as periodic review by the financial management analyst at the Country&#13;
Office.&#13;

75.     Special Account (SA). A SA will be opened by MOF in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA&#13;
in order to facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures under the Grant. The SA would be&#13;
operated by the PMU under terms satisfactory to IDA. IDA would, upon request, make an authorized&#13;
allocation of 10 percent of the Grant. This percentage will be reviewed once implementation has&#13;
commenced for a possible increasedepending on the speed of disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
76.     The SA replenishment applications will be documented according to IDA guidelines, including a&#13;
bank statement of the SA, and a reconciliation bank statement of the SA against IDA records.&#13;
Replenishment applications will be submitted regularly (preferably bimonthly, butnot less than monthly).&#13;

SECTION F. FINANCIALAND ECONOMIC            JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
77.     The proposed emergency Project i s being prepared under emergency recovery assistance&#13;
procedures (OP 8.50).     Limited time and availability of economic data prevent detailed analysis, a&#13;
recognized constraint in preparing such operations. However, a preliminary analysis was undertaken and&#13;
the findings indicate that if the data for the Western villages are representative for the whole Hebron&#13;
Governorate, the economic rate of return of the program i s estimated at 21 percent. If the Bani Na'im&#13;
well field and associated transmission as well as the Halhoul-Dura pipeline are excluded, thus including&#13;
only the investments destined to the Western villages, the rate of return drops to 10percent.&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Emergency Water Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Emergency
            Water Project is to help alleviate the chronic shortages of
            safe water supplies, and reduce system losses, water costs
            and health risks. The project will finance high priority
            components of an emergency investment program, as follows:
            1) Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Supplv
            Transmission and Distribution System: (a) supply and
            installation of electromechanical works for the existing
            East Herodian well #2 (EH#2); (b) installation of about 7.5
            km of 16-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission
            pipeline, from the well to the existing, main north-south
            transmission carrier; (c) installation of about 15 km of 16
            to 6-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission
            pipeline from the existing Halhoul regional water reservoir
            to the western villages of Kharas and Nuba; and, (d)
            rehabilitation of existing water distribution networks in
            the western villages of Kharas and Nuba. 2) Technical
            Assistance: (i) strengthening of the existing Project
            Management Unit (PMU) within the Palestinian Water Authority
            (PWA), to enable it to effectively supervise project
            execution, and collaborate with other donors in the creation
            of a framework for the development of joint services
            councils clusters, that will be responsible for operating,
            and maintaining retail water distribution throughout the
            project area; and, (ii) preparation of designs, and bidding
            documents for the Dura and Yatta villages' distribution
            networks, for implementation under a proposed follow-up project.
