FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family planning   programs.    They  include  several country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.      The&#13;
papers   are  the   work   of   individuals  and   the   views  and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper explores several related propositions about rural economic&#13;
life and demographic change. A central thesis is that the shrinking of the&#13;
farm labor force associated with past processes of economic development led to&#13;
lower fertility. A subsidiary thesis is that this effect may no longer be&#13;
essential to cause fertility decline; government population policies can&#13;
substitute for it. These propositions are not meant to replace other theories&#13;
about the economic-demographic transition but rather to complement and add&#13;
some more detail to them.&#13;
This paper emphasizes two features of the transition in now-industrial&#13;
countries: (1) the rising costs and falling benefits to parents of having&#13;
many children, and (2) the link of that change to productivity growth in and&#13;
structural change away from farming. Labor-saving innovations on farms&#13;
lessened the benefits of children, causing the main fertility transition.&#13;
Women left unpaid family labor on farms to work in offices, factories, and&#13;
shops; this shift depressed fertility as jobs interfered with child care.&#13;
Jobs for children were fewer in urban than in rural settings, so more children&#13;
attended school, and most parents decided to have fewer but better-educated&#13;
children. The Europeans thus escaped the Malthusian trap. The paper examines&#13;
prospects for a similar demographic transition in low and middle income&#13;
countries.&#13;
The annex describes world and regional estimates of gross and per&#13;
capita product for selected dates from 1800 to 1980 and projections to the&#13;
year 2000. The closing section of the annex summarizes some logical errors in&#13;
the estimation of per capita product growth rates since 1950. Growth rates&#13;
reported for low-income countries since 1950 probably overstate improvements&#13;
in welfare or levels of living. The results underline the speculative quality&#13;
of assessments of long-term changes in income and product.&#13;

Economic Aspects of Historical Demographic Change&#13;
Summary and conclusions&#13;
This paper examines how change in rural areas, and especially in farm&#13;
production, can generate change in economic-demographic relationships. The&#13;
most important of the changes examined is the demographic transition from high&#13;
to low fertility, a change which now lies in the past for all industrial&#13;
economies. A major issue for economic development today is when it will&#13;
occur, and under what economic circumstances, in the less developed&#13;
countries. To throw light on that issue this paper analyzes the past, both&#13;
epochs well before detailed statistical data are available, and the near past,&#13;
the period since 1950 in which numerical dimensions of change are more&#13;
reliably reported.&#13;
Given the quantitative significance of primary activities in&#13;
low-income countries, this emphasis on the correlates of demographic change in&#13;
rural areas may seem to belabor the obvious. Before the industrial age, which&#13;
began around 1800, about 95 percent of the world's population lived in rural&#13;
areas, and most gained their livelihood from hunting, gathering , and, once&#13;
the agricultural age began, from farming and animal husbandry. In 1980, 80&#13;
percent of the residents of the low-income countries still lived in rural&#13;
areas, and 70 percent of their labor force worked in agriculture. Although&#13;
the populations of rural areas are numerically dominant, they seem singularly&#13;
unlikely to generate change and are instead regarded as a passive bloc which&#13;
can be changed only in response to events in the cities.&#13;
Thus some descriptions of the development process give major emphasis&#13;
to leading industrial or transport sectors, the urban economy, and&#13;
international trade and exchange. These perspectives on development emphasize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
how sectors outside the rural economy impose new factor prices and demands&#13;
to which thie rural sector then responds in a more or less rapid fashion.&#13;
W. Arthur Lewis offered an elegant formulation of this stylized development&#13;
process in his article on economic development with unlimited supplies of&#13;
labor; the further work of Fei and Ranis on development of the labor-surplus&#13;
economy explored the elasticities of response of the rural sector to the&#13;
stimulus fr-om urban-industrial growth. This genre, of which the works cited&#13;
are but the! outstanding examples from a large literature, can be characterized&#13;
by the presumption of passivity in the rural sector itself.&#13;
The rise of farm productivity&#13;
For the now-developed countries, which transformed their economies&#13;
between 1800 and 1960, productivity rose nearly as quickly in farming as it&#13;
did in induLStrial and service sectors. Rural areas were not simply passive&#13;
agents resistant to change but instead transformed their technologies pari&#13;
passu with the overall development process. This process was accompanied by&#13;
changes in demographic variables, particularly the decline in fertility. Thus&#13;
Kuznets couLld observe, in reviewing international and intersectoral fertility&#13;
differentials, that differences between developed and less developed countries&#13;
are far gre-ater than differences between the urban and rural areas of either&#13;
grouping.&#13;
Whatever processes were transforming economic-demographic&#13;
relationships in the cities must also have been at work in the rural areas of&#13;
the transformed economies. A reasonable conclusion would thus seem to be that&#13;
economic-demographic transformation for today's low-income countries may also&#13;
require that in the future similar processes occur in the rural areas of those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
countries. A main characteristic of that transformation, it may be&#13;
hypothesized, would have to be technological change in agriculture that yields&#13;
improvements in farm labor productivity. This means, although economists&#13;
rarely emphasize it, that some workers must be made redundant by new&#13;
technology so that the product of the remaining workers will on average be&#13;
higher. (Labor redundancy could only be avoided in the unlikely event that&#13;
demand for farm products would be highly income elastic.) It is especially&#13;
useful that the new technology make child labor redundant: As demand for&#13;
child labor lessens, families can more readily send them to school and thus&#13;
hasten the process by which they can move from farm work to urban&#13;
occupations. It may also be useful if the new technology enhances the income&#13;
of women relative to men. Women would thus become relatively more useful as&#13;
producers and hence lessen their dependence on the role of motherhood. There&#13;
are few empirical analyses which identify what technologies have influenced&#13;
the relative demand for male, female, and child labor in agriculture.&#13;
The British experience&#13;
There is only one developed country, England and Wales, for which&#13;
there are long-period data that has been used to analyze the relationship&#13;
between economic and demographic change. As is characteristic of most&#13;
discussions in British economic history, the scholarly literature has not&#13;
resolved to all participants' satisfaction the nature of the causal links&#13;
between demographic variables and standards of living. On balance, however,&#13;
the literature on the period from the thirteenth through the eighteenth&#13;
centuries points to a Malthusian conclusion: that autonomous shocks to the&#13;
demographic-ecoromic balance brought on, for example, by plague in the late&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Middle Ages, led to corrections which raised wages and generated subsequent&#13;
increases in fertility until some new equilibrium was established without&#13;
achieving large increases in standards of living for the population on&#13;
average. The balance of population and food supply seems to have worked out&#13;
over hundreds of years prior to the industrial age to yield a version of the&#13;
Malthusian trap. Modern scholarship thus seems to confirm, though haltingly&#13;
and with numerous qualifications, the pertinence of the Malthusian analysis&#13;
for the period which Malthus himself reviewed, i.e., the historical experience&#13;
of England and Wales up to the time of publication of the Essay on population,&#13;
the first edition of which appeared in 1798.&#13;
But even as Malthus was writing, economic-demographic relationships&#13;
were already changing in Britain, and indeed had already begun to change in&#13;
France about a decade before his essay was published. Instead of bearing more&#13;
children to eat up the gains of improvements in farm production, French&#13;
families were beginning to delay the births of their third and fourth&#13;
children--so much so that in the nineteenth century France's population never&#13;
increased by more than 1 percent per annum. Furthermore, France offered very&#13;
few migrants to people the open spaces of the western hemisphere attracting 50&#13;
million Europeans. In Britain, which did send millions of people to North&#13;
America, changing productivity in rural areas cut the demand for labor,&#13;
especially child labor. By the 1840s there was no longer much work for&#13;
children in the shrinking rural sector, and child labor laws cut into their&#13;
value in cities as well. In the second half of the century, more British&#13;
began sending their children to school (only 8 percent of primary-age children&#13;
were in school in 1851, 75 percent by 1910), a change which also diminished&#13;
the immediate production that parents could hope to wring from their&#13;
offspring. Thus diminished demand for children labor, coupled with the limits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
on supply posed by the need to be in school, shrank the near-term benefits of&#13;
child-labor income to parents from perhaps 1815 onward.&#13;
Part of the response to this change was to bear fewer children. Just&#13;
as important for long-term development prospects was a related response: to&#13;
put children in school for more years and hence prepare them for more&#13;
productive working lives in adult life. The Malthusian trap was thus broken&#13;
in England and Wales, not because fertility immediately fell (marital&#13;
fertility remained high until the 1890s) but because it did not rise. The&#13;
gradual rise in wages could thus be transformed into gradual improvements in&#13;
per capita income which occurred especially in the second and third quarters&#13;
of the century. Among the most striking features of the economic-demographic&#13;
transition noted in retrospective reviews, is that it has so far proven to be&#13;
irreversible: Once fertility decline and improvements in standards of living&#13;
are set in place, they continue, even accelerate, until low levels of&#13;
fertility prevail throughout the now-transformed societies.&#13;
The spread of the transition&#13;
The economic-demographic transition spread from England and Wales to&#13;
the rest of northwest Europe. Francophone Europe, France itself and parts of&#13;
Belgium and Switzerland, led in the demographic transition and was among the&#13;
first areas outside England and Wales to enter the industrial age. Other&#13;
countries got started into the process of transformation only in the last&#13;
quarter--and many in the last decade--of the nineteenth century. The&#13;
Scandanavian countries best fit the now-classic formulation of the demographic&#13;
transition: The economy improves so that death rates fall; fertility adjusts&#13;
downward with a lag of several decades in which population grows rapidly; a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
new equilibrium of low birth and death rates is established along with stable&#13;
economic growth. For England and Wales the delay in fertility decline was too&#13;
long (nine or more decades), and for France fertility decline began prior to&#13;
the onset of the industrial age. Recent analyses confirm that economic-&#13;
demographic relationships during transition are not so simple as the classic&#13;
formulation suggests. For low-income countries the conclusion is a happy&#13;
one: The demographic transition is not a straitjacket into which all&#13;
countries must fit to achieve development objectives.&#13;
Of particular interest are findings about the demographic transition&#13;
that relate to relative backwardness, i.e., to the gap between the leader in&#13;
the process and the putative follower at the time the process of transition&#13;
begins. The more backward a country at the time it entered the early phase of&#13;
economic growth, the swifter was its progress in industrialization and&#13;
subsequent income growth. Similarly, a comparison of fertility transitions in&#13;
Europe showed that the later the onset of the fertility decline, the more&#13;
rapidly did the decline occur. The Japanese experience of a 50 percent&#13;
decline in martial fertility in the single decade of the 1950s provides at&#13;
once a confirmation and extension of that finding based on the European&#13;
experience. These comparisons thus suggest that low-income countries could&#13;
emerge from a Malthusian trap--if one exists for them--rather quickly. The&#13;
availability of modern methods of fertility control since the 1960s makes the&#13;
process easier today than it was for the Europeans a century ago.&#13;
The process of economic-demographic transformation does seem to have&#13;
spread, i.e., it was not reinvented independently in the several European&#13;
countries but benefited from technology transfer and diffusion processes&#13;
across national boundaries until it encompassed most of the European cultural&#13;
area extending into the Americas and Oceania. But, except for Japan, an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exception meriting detailed analysis, the transformation did not spread&#13;
readily to other culture areas before the 1960s. A principal reason seems to&#13;
be European willingness to defer marriage (and sexual gratification?) many&#13;
years beyond that of other culture groups. This feature of social relations&#13;
shows how Japan has for centuries been more like the Europeans than like&#13;
Japan's neighbors in Asia.&#13;
Was Japan different?&#13;
Japan is still the only country outside the European cultural sphere&#13;
which was poor at the beginning of this century and is now rich. In 1900&#13;
Japanese GNP per capita was a tenth that of England and Wales, a twentieth&#13;
that of the United States (see Figure 1.2 in World Development Report 1984).&#13;
Japan now ranks in the middle of the range of per capita income of the&#13;
industrial market economies. But even at the start of the period of sustained&#13;
growth for Japan one feature set it apart from the other countries of Asia:&#13;
Mean age at marriage was between 22 and 25 years, and about 40 percent of&#13;
women aged fifteen to forty-four were not married and hence not exposed to&#13;
pregnancy. As a result birth rates rarely exceeded thirty per thousand, far&#13;
lower than the 40 to 50 range prevailing in South and Southeast Asia.&#13;
Japan is the only country to have joined the industrial market&#13;
economies from outside the European culture sphere, but it is not the only&#13;
low-income country to have begun the process of improving levels of income. A&#13;
recent review identified two dozen low- and middle-income countries which&#13;
began to develop before 1945, most of those before 1914. Income rose for&#13;
periods of a decade or more in these countries without approaching rates of&#13;
change adequate to raise standards of living to the ranks of the industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economies. CNP per capita in Brazil and Mexico, for example, is only&#13;
one-fifth the level of Japan, despite the fact that income has been growing,&#13;
with some reversals, since the 1870s in both countries. A dozen middle-income&#13;
countries like Brazil and Mexico began processes of economic transformation a&#13;
half-century, to as much as a century in the past, and yet have still not&#13;
achieved high standards of living. Another dozen low-income in Africa and&#13;
Asia also passed a turning point to slow improvements in standards of living&#13;
more than at half-century ago but are still mired in poverty.&#13;
Prospects for catching up&#13;
It is troublesome to conclude that catching up to the rich countries,&#13;
or even lessening the wide gaps that now exist between rich and poor, may not&#13;
occur. In a look backward over the two centuries since the industrial age&#13;
began, the data on the rich-poor gap suggest that the European countries have&#13;
steadily expanded their advantage over the rest of the world. European&#13;
incomes were 1.5 to 3.5 times higher than the average for the rest of the&#13;
world in 1800 and were 5 to 11 times higher by 1980. The gap has not grown&#13;
wider in the post World War II era; neither has it shrunk despite impressive&#13;
gains in Asia, Latin America, and even Africa. World Bank projections&#13;
extended to the year 2000 suggest that the gap could diminish somewhat.&#13;
Those countries which have the best prospects of helping to diminish&#13;
the rich-poor gap may be those which successfully transform their rural&#13;
sectors. Income growth based only on productivity improvements in industry&#13;
and services will not be adequate to permit countries to move from low- and&#13;
middle-income status to higher income levels. Transformation of the rural&#13;
economy, specifically the spread of new technologies which raise labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
productivity in farming and free labor for work outside that sector, is the&#13;
critical change which can lead to the higher standards of living that so far&#13;
only the European countries and Japan have achieved.&#13;
The role of policy&#13;
Policy aimed at reducing fertility, in conjunction with achieving&#13;
transformation of the rural economy, may help add to the number of countries&#13;
that reach the standards of living of the industrial economies. A policy to&#13;
slow population growth, accompanied by a decline in the share of labor force&#13;
working in agriculture, has resulted in lower fertility in many countries.&#13;
Some countries, particularly China and to a lesser extent India, have managed&#13;
to achieve significant changes in demographic variables (both birth and death&#13;
rates) without much reduction in the share of labor force in agriculture.&#13;
These cases are exceptional, however; for more than a dozen countries the&#13;
percentage change in the share of labor force in agriculture is about equal to&#13;
the sum of changes in birth and death rates over periods of two to ten&#13;
decades. Effective policies and progress in development work best in&#13;
improving demographic conditions when they work together.&#13;
This proposition is nowhere better demonstrated than in the&#13;
comparison of birth-rate changes and decline in farm labor forces for major&#13;
country groupings in the period 1960 through 1982. The industrial economies&#13;
experienced the largest percentage decline in fertility (67 percent in two&#13;
decades) and the largest decline in the share of labor force working in&#13;
agriculture (31 percent). The low-income economies, excluding China, had only&#13;
a 10 percent decline in fertility and a 5 percent decline in the farm-labor-&#13;
force share. China's performance is completely exceptional: a 53 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decline in fertility with only a 7 percent decline in the farm-labor-force&#13;
share. This performance offers some indication of how large a role China's&#13;
population-limitation policy had to play to achieve such a large birth-rate&#13;
decline. Development per se, the transformation of the rural sector, offered&#13;
little help to the Chinese.&#13;
A comparison of Korea and India is instructive. Over the years 1960&#13;
through 1980 Korea managed to raise labor productivity in agriculture by 6.4&#13;
percent per annum. Over the same period farm worker productivity in India&#13;
declined by nearly one percent per annum. Rural change in Korea was helping&#13;
the process of demographic transformation by cutting labor demand; the lack of&#13;
productivity, growth in India was working against demographic transformation&#13;
adding to the burden on population policy to help slow population growth.&#13;
In the past three decades, perhaps in part because of the&#13;
availability of modern methods of family planning, economic and demographic&#13;
change have become increasingly delinked. It is possible to slow population&#13;
growth even without the transformation of rural economies that played so large&#13;
a role in the economic-demographic transitions of the past. China and India&#13;
have proved that demographic change is possible if there is political&#13;
commitment to achieve it. These, and other cases as well, also suggest the&#13;
less sanguine conclusion that demographic change itself is not necessarily a&#13;
prelude to change in economic structure and hence is no guarantee of higher&#13;
standards of- living.&#13;
The data background&#13;
To prepare this paper it was necessary to assemble economic and&#13;
demographic data from secondary sources, a task which proved to be both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lengthy and complicated. An annex summarizes information on estimates of&#13;
incomes, population, and total product for the world and major regions between&#13;
1800 and 1980 with projections to the year 2000. Two methods were used to&#13;
assemble information on product: The exchange-rate method and the purchasing-&#13;
power-parity method. The former method can be used more extensively is space&#13;
and time because required data are broadly available; the latter is&#13;
conceptually more correct and is widely believed to reflect better real&#13;
differences in welfare.&#13;
The annex also reviews critically several efforts at growth&#13;
accounting for the period 1950 through 1982. In light of certain deficiencies&#13;
in growth accounting which tend to overstate improvements in real welfare, the&#13;
annex goes on to correct growth rates and to consider the implications of the&#13;
adjusted rates for international comparisons. This exercise suggests that&#13;
growth rates of per capita product in the period 1950 through 1983 that appear&#13;
in official sources overstate growth by one-third or more for all regions, the&#13;
overstatment being greatest for the poorest regions.&#13;
A widening gap?&#13;
In a long-term perspective, the data confirm that the gap between&#13;
rich and poor countries increased steadily from the start of the industrial&#13;
age around 1800 through 1960. Official data show that the gap neither closed&#13;
nor widened between 1950 and 1980. With the adjustments proposed in the&#13;
annex, the conclusion is virtually inevitable that the gap widened further in&#13;
the past thirty years.&#13;
This reexamination of growth rates awakens renewed concern about the&#13;
implications of rapid population growth for poverty, income distribution, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the gap between rich and poor nations. There may be, for the poorest&#13;
countries, no automatic response of fertility decline to structural change&#13;
associated with income gains because income has not, and may not in the&#13;
future, rise to induce such change. More effective population polices may&#13;
thus be essential to escape a vicious circle of economic stagnation and&#13;
population increase in the poorest countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. The agricultural age and before&#13;
Scholars differ with respect to the timing of the first appearance of&#13;
homo sapiens. Some suggest that the first of humankind appeared in the&#13;
highlands of East Africa near the start of the Pleistocene age about I million&#13;
BC; a later starting date, about 400,000 years ago, seems now to enjoy broader&#13;
support. Those born in this century live in but one-ten-thousandth of the&#13;
time homo sapiens have so far tread upon the earth. Yet about 9 percent of&#13;
all humans ever born are alive today, thanks to the recency and rapidity of&#13;
the acceleration of population growth (Westing 1981, 523). Whichever date one&#13;
picks, the limited evidence available suggests that humans never exceeded ten&#13;
million in number before about 8,000 BC, when the agricultural age began&#13;
(Durand 1977). Thomas Hobbes thought such people's lives were 'solitary,&#13;
poor, nasty, brutish, and short.' But more recent assessments show that early&#13;
human communities normally did not expand up to the limit of the carrying&#13;
capacity of their ecological niche. Their high mortality did not necessarily&#13;
imply misery. Parasites and disease kept human numbers well below a level at&#13;
which starvation or famine was a major cause of death (McNeill 1976). One&#13;
modern hunter-gatherer population, the !Kung of Botswana, keep their total&#13;
fertility rate at about 5, less than a third the attainable maximum (Dumond&#13;
1975).&#13;
Some hunter-gatherers living today restrict the size of their&#13;
families by spacing births by about four years, by infanticide, and by induced&#13;
abortion. Those of the past may have done so as well. Birth spacing was&#13;
essential because mothers could not carry more than a single infant in the&#13;
ften vast treks (4000 kilometers per annum for !Kung women) required by the&#13;
search for food (Dumond 1975, 715). Variations in fertility in primitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
societies helped communities maintain an equilibrium between population and&#13;
resources (Dumond 1975, 714). Furthermore, some communities expanded the&#13;
range of foods they ate, and others split into separate groups migrating into&#13;
less congested areas thus spreading out more effectively over the landscape&#13;
(Boserup 1981).&#13;
In many ways human populations could adapt to higher population&#13;
density, to population growth and to food availability. The fragmentary&#13;
evidence at hand suggests that humankind evolved in a single setting in East&#13;
Africa and then migrated outward from that original site to other parts of the&#13;
globe, thereafter undergoing the racial differentiation observable today&#13;
(Barraclough 1984, 36-46). There is evidence of homo sapiens in Southeast&#13;
Asia in 40,001) BC; others entered Europe on routes both north and south of the&#13;
Mediterranean about 30,000 BC and arrived in the Americas about 2,000 BC&#13;
(Barraclough 1984, 46, 132). Analysts have come to refer to multiphasic&#13;
responses of human populations to cover the wide range of actions which&#13;
communities took to mitigate the problems of population growth and greater&#13;
density (Davis 1963). Migration was but one of those responses. The resort&#13;
to agriculture itself may have been part of the process of adaptation to an&#13;
increase in world population.&#13;
Two somewhat different ways of looking at the long-term trends in&#13;
world population appear in Box 4.6 of World Development Report, 1984, page&#13;
76. The upper graph shows an unmistakable population explosion beginning very&#13;
recently in historical time. The utility of that picture lies in&#13;
distinguishing the twentieth century from all past time. Yet it hides&#13;
important features of change in human experience brought out in the lower&#13;
graph. That cliagram shows the same data but over a longer time period (Cf.&#13;
Deevey 1960, EBarraclough 1984, 36, and Porter 1984).   It shows human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
population expanding up to three separate limits: (1) From the origins of&#13;
humankind until about 8000 BC world population was limited to about 10&#13;
million; (2) from that epoch until 1800, humankind's numbers did not exceed&#13;
1,000 million, and (3) the outlook for the future is that world population&#13;
will come barely to exceed 10,000 million by the middle of the twenty-first&#13;
century. The limits to growth implied by these figures are technologically&#13;
determined. It is the purpose of this paper to explore how population and&#13;
production possibilities interacted in the past and thus to learn lessons&#13;
pertinent to current population and development interactions.&#13;
Malthus believed that humankind's propensity to grow in numbers would&#13;
outstrip resources and lead to continuing human misery. The theory of the&#13;
demographic transition to be described below offers an alternative analysis&#13;
more obviously compatible with observable evidence than Malthusian pessimism.&#13;
The developed countries, at least, have enjoyed significant and sustained&#13;
improvements in levels of living. A corollary to demographic-transition&#13;
theory is that some homeostatic balance can be established between population&#13;
and resources (Cf. Lee 1983). If homeostasis exists without policy&#13;
interventions, then there may be no need for concern about high fertility and&#13;
population growth. But as the experience of the developed countries refutes&#13;
Malthusian pessimism, the experience of the low-income countries refutes&#13;
homeostatic optimism.&#13;
In Table 1 appear notional estimates of the size of world population&#13;
up to 1750 AD. These figures are little more than best guesses of competent&#13;
scholars who acknowledge that there is too little evidence before 8000 BC to&#13;
assess population numbers (Dumond 1975, Durand 1977). These figures do&#13;
however help illustrate how slowly human numbers must have grown before the&#13;
agricultural age. If population grew at a steady pace over the 292,000 years&#13;

Source:  Durand (1977) and author's estimates.    The&#13;
growth rate for the initial period assumes that popula&#13;
tion grew from an original pair in 300,000 BC. Cf.&#13;
Westing (1981) for a review of other approaches to&#13;
estimating growth.&#13;
from the first appearance of humans to 8000 BC, then the annual rate of growth&#13;
was but five thousandths of one percent. The rate of expansion for the first&#13;
5,000 years of the agricultural age was perhaps ten times faster than that of&#13;
the earlier epoch. Deevey estimated that human population multiplied about&#13;
sixteen times between 8000 and 4000 BC (Deevey 1960, 195-204). It is in part&#13;
because of that population expansion and the greater economic and social&#13;
complexity which it permitted that scholars regard the agricultural revolution&#13;
as the greatest forward step of humankind (Cipolla 1970, 1978). It was the&#13;
first time that numbers and population density grew sufficiently to permit&#13;
social stratification, accumulation of capital, division of labor and&#13;
function, specialization and trade. These complex social arrangements were in&#13;
turn critical for innovation and further progress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Around 8000 BC food production began independently in western and&#13;
eastern Asia; it began around 5000 BC in Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central&#13;
America today), and 4000 BC in the Andean highlands (Cipolla 1978, 18-27).&#13;
The similarity of timing suggests that the agricultural age might have&#13;
been induced by the changes necessary to respond to population increase.&#13;
Alternatively, population increase was a response to increased food&#13;
production. A possible cause of both changes was climatic improvements&#13;
(Braudel 1979). About 10,000 years ago, the glaciers, which for a million&#13;
years had oscillated over the face of Europe and North America, began their&#13;
most recent retreat. Deciduous forests began to invade western Europe and&#13;
helped create a habitat suitable for human occupance and the start of the&#13;
mesolithic period from 8000 to 4500 BC (McNeill 1963, 8). Agriculture, which&#13;
got its start not in Europe but in the Middle East where the earliest sites&#13;
data from about 6500 BC, could with climatic improvements extend over a much&#13;
wider geographic range. Production of wheat and barley diffused outward from&#13;
Middle Eastern sites to northern India, China, and Europe, skipping over some&#13;
areas less densely populated.&#13;
As late as 1500 AD, North America, most of South America, Africa and&#13;
Australia were still occupied almost entirely by hunters and gatherers. Rural&#13;
populations throughout the developing world still obtain a significant portion&#13;
of their consumption from hunting and gathering. A 1975 survey in Botswana&#13;
found that 96 percent of all rural households derived some of their&#13;
consumption more than 10 percent among the poor--from gathering (Watanabe and&#13;
Mueller 1984, 120-21). It was only after greater population densities in&#13;
Europe and Asia led to intercontinental migrations that the agricultural age&#13;
extended to virtually all parts of the globe (Boserup 1981, 31-62).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Settled agriculture created opportunities for a surplus above&#13;
subsistence, for greater population densities, for concentration in urban&#13;
centers, and for division of labor between agricultural and nonfarming&#13;
occupations. The first great burst of population growth, from under 10&#13;
million to around 300 million at the start of the Christian era, was thus&#13;
coincident with the agricultural age. Most of the growth of population during&#13;
the agricultural age, (8000 BC to 1800 AD) a period of nearly 10,000 years,&#13;
was concentrated in four periods: (1) Around 3000 BC, particularly in Asia&#13;
and North Africa; (2) in the first millenium BC when the ancient iron-age&#13;
civilizations of China, India, Persia, and the Mediterranean region rose to&#13;
their zenith; (3) in the years 1100-1350 in Europe and China, and (4) in the&#13;
years 1450 to 1650 everywhere except the Americas (Durand 1977, 259). Each&#13;
new phase of population expansion was associated with new production&#13;
techniques in agriculture.    The new technologies of agriculture and animal&#13;
husbandry increased carrying capacity, enlarging if not breaking the&#13;
Malthusian vicious circle of limited food supplies, population growth, and&#13;
retrenchment associated with higher death rates. The data available on&#13;
population by world region through 1975 are shown in Table 2 taken from Durand&#13;
(1977). The data in Tables 1 and 2 thus report aggregate information about&#13;
population totals, and by region, for the period of human existence before the&#13;
industrial age.&#13;
Knowledge of the early periods is quite limited, but available&#13;
evidence suggests that none of these accelerations of world population growth&#13;
resulted in higher levels of living. Population growth could not occur&#13;
without technological progress, but the progress which did occur was&#13;
insufficient to yield a sustained rise in per capita incomes. Scholars&#13;
believe that levels of living in the Nile delta were largely unchanged between&#13;
4000 BC and the early twentieth century. It was, in short, a Malthusian&#13;

growth without development in which numbers expanded without improvements for&#13;
individuals. It is perhaps revealing of a tendency for population to grow up&#13;
to, but not to exceed, a limit set by the technology of the agricultural age,&#13;
that world population in 1450 was not much greater than it had been at the&#13;
time of Christ.&#13;
The two centuries ending around 1650 witnessed substantial population&#13;
growth on a scale not previously recorded. It was a period of more rapid&#13;
population growth than any which preceded it, the first time that growth&#13;
accelerated to a rate higher than one quarter of one percent per annum.&#13;
Worldwide climatic change, a global warming tendency beginning in the fifteenth&#13;
century, provided the basis for improved yields in agriculture and a long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
period of escape from the periodic plagues, poor harvests, and near starvation&#13;
of earlier epochs (Braudel 1979, Lee in Wrigley and Schofield 1981, Lindert&#13;
1983 EEH).&#13;
In China and South Asia population grew about 60 percent over those&#13;
two centuries. Over the same period, European population doubled. Confucian,&#13;
Indian, Muslim, and European civilizations flourished in four areas of the Old&#13;
World, meeting at their margins for expanded trade and exchange. This was the&#13;
earliest lphase of European, Chinese, and Indian overseas expansion, of&#13;
intensification of agriculture in China and the height of mughal Indian&#13;
cultural and architectural achievement (McNeill 1976; Perkins 1969, 1975;&#13;
Braudel 1979, 1982, Barraclough 1984, 154). The migrations were probably the&#13;
direct result of population pressures in the heartlands of these cultures.&#13;
The cultural achievements of the sixteenth century must also have been due in&#13;
part to greater population densities, the urban growth which those densities&#13;
permitted, and the impetus to change which demographic pressures created.&#13;
The estimated percentage of world population living in urban areas&#13;
from 100 AD through the twentieth century is shown in Table 3. The rate of&#13;
urbanization reached 6 percent, an historic peak, in 1600, not to be exceeded&#13;
until 1851) (Graumann 1977). This finding tends to confirm the proposition&#13;
that comparatively little development occurred between the time of the initial&#13;
achievements of the agricultural age and the further technological&#13;
improvements associated with the industrial age. Jericho, the first walled&#13;
city for which we have any recorded was founded between 8350 and 7350 BC&#13;
(Barraclough 1984, 16).&#13;
The estimates in Table 3 are based on spotty knowledge about the&#13;
population size of a varying number of cities at past dates, supplemented with&#13;
an application of the rank-size rule which was used to estimate the population&#13;

to be equal to the inverse of each city's rank times the size of the largest&#13;
city in the system. For example, if the largest city is one million in&#13;
population, the tenth-largest is predicted to be one-tenth of that size or one&#13;
hundred thousand in population. Graumann made refinements of this rule and&#13;
used available information on the size of cities in the past to estimate the&#13;

total in all cities. These quantities, divided by the mean population&#13;
estimates developed by Durand, yield the estimated urbanization rates in&#13;
Table 3.&#13;
Many of the achievements of this period could not have occurred&#13;
without the great increase in population (Braudel 1972). The greater scale of&#13;
societies permitted greater propinquity, along with the advantages thereof,&#13;
and hence a certain kind of progress, but it did not yield better conditions&#13;
of life for most people. That achievement would await the opening of the&#13;
industrial age nearly three centuries later. The lesson of this epoch is that&#13;
population growth can occur on the basis of expanded opportunities. These&#13;
opportunities in turn set limits. The opportunities for growth, that is,&#13;
increase in numbers, do not guarantee that development--better levels of&#13;
living--will occur. Population expansion in the sixteenth century, during the&#13;
age of the Renaissance, did not lead to development, and expanded total output&#13;
did not so increase the economies of scale as to result in higher&#13;
productivity.&#13;
The Little Ice Age of the seventeenth century brought population&#13;
decline and severe economic depression until well into the eighteenth&#13;
century. For the globe as a whole the rate of urbanization and even the&#13;
absolute rnumbers living in cities declined after 1600 (Graumann 1977; Bairoch&#13;
has prepared somewhat different estimates). The expansionary phase of the&#13;
European Rtenaissance gave way to stagnation. East-West trade in the&#13;
Mediterranean grew moribund (Braudel 1972). The positive achievements of&#13;
Mughal India yielded to an era of internal conflict and no further population&#13;
growth between 1675 and 1800. The purchasing power of wage earners was nearly&#13;
the same in 1961 as it had been in 1595. 'But the low-paid worker of Akbar's&#13;
time was able to help keep the standard of nutrition much higher than now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
because of cheap meat, ghi and milk' (Raychaudhuri and Habib 1982, 465).&#13;
Chinese population declined from 1600 to 1650 and began a slow recovery which&#13;
lasted into the nineteenth century. The population of the Americas was&#13;
devastated by the incursion of new diseases, particularly smallpox, measles,&#13;
and typhus brought from the Old World. Some estimates put the population of&#13;
the Americas at 100 million at the time of the arrival of the Europeans&#13;
(McNeill 1976). That number had declined to about 16 million by 1570 and&#13;
reached its nadir of 10 million by 1650. Mexico, a city of 300,000&#13;
inhabitants when the Spaniards reached there in 1520, declined thereafter&#13;
during a century-long depression (Borah 1957, 1964). "By far the greatest&#13;
change occurred in the Americas, where the native population declines by 90&#13;
percent within a century, to be replaced by white Europeans, black Africans,&#13;
and a mixed race of mestizos" (Barraclough 1984, 154). Growth of population&#13;
did not resume until after 1750 (McNeill 1976, 176-207).&#13;
The gains of the agricultural age continued to diffuse and&#13;
consolidate in a process that even today remains incomplete. Throughout that&#13;
process innovations did not lead to improvements in the levels of living of&#13;
most persons. Life expectancy in 1600 was no longer than it had been two&#13;
thousand years earlier (Lee in Easterlin 1980, Lindert 1984). Everyone's&#13;
health was in more or less constant jeopardy from communicable disease. A&#13;
tiny percentage of persons were literate or numerate before 1600 save in&#13;
exceptional cities such as Athens and Rome. The notable achievements of the&#13;
four great Old World cultures, as well as those of Incan, Mayan, and Mexican&#13;
civilization in the Americas, were all the work of tiny elites. The&#13;
Malthusian conditions of population limited by food supply seemed to rule&#13;
everywhere (Cipolla 1969, 8, 38). The record and implications of that&#13;
interaction have been best analyzed for England and Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
New data published in the past decade has brought to light&#13;
considerabl.e detail on the long-term interactions of population growth, food&#13;
supply, and the distribution of income in England over the centuries from 1200&#13;
to 1850. B3y examining in the long run how population growth affects wages,&#13;
rents, and the standard of living, we can identify relationships that are&#13;
muddied by the complexity of many other forces at work in the contemporary&#13;
world (see Box 4.2, p. 57, in World Development Report, 1984). These issues&#13;
can only be addressed empirically when all other variables are, in effect,&#13;
held constant because of the very long time frame in which population-&#13;
development: interactions must be observed.&#13;
For the economies of preindustrial England (and Europe), population&#13;
change emerges clearly as the dominant cause of long-run changes in wages,&#13;
rents, industrial prices and income distribution (cf. Habakkuk and Postan&#13;
1965, 1-49). Considering the period from the thirteenth through the&#13;
eighteenth centuries, an econometric analysis has demonstrated that the&#13;
economy could absorb population growth at about 0.4 percent per annum with&#13;
little effect on the key variables. Deviations of population size above or&#13;
below this trend line had dramatic consequences: a 10 percent increase in&#13;
population depressed wages by 22 percent; raised rents by 19 percent; lowered&#13;
industrial prices relative to agricultural prices by 17 percent; raised the&#13;
ratio of industrial to agricultural production by 13 percent, and lowered&#13;
labor's share of national income by 14 percent (Lee in Easterlin 1980).&#13;
Population growth above a fairly slow rate (when compared to rates&#13;
currently prevailing in poor countries) favored landlords over workers and&#13;
lowered labor's share of total income. In England, and on the continent as&#13;
well, periods of rapid population growth and price increase were also periods&#13;
in which real wages sank and the relative price of foodstuffs rose. Higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
rates of population growth brought higher prices, and population growth&#13;
lowered real wage rates (Lindert 1983). Population growth had strong and&#13;
predictable effects, beneficial for some social classes and damaging for&#13;
others (Habakkuk and Postan 1965, 1-59).&#13;
The most dramatic sustained movements in the available real wage&#13;
series before 1800 were a rise from the Black Death era (c. 1350) to about&#13;
1500, a fall from 1500 to about 1610, a rise from 1610 to 1750, and a decline&#13;
from 1750 to 1800. The two periods of wage rise began during or just after&#13;
serious declines in life expectancy. The price of food relative to&#13;
manufactures more than doubled across the long period of rising population and&#13;
declining real wages from 1500 to the 1630s. That price continued to be high&#13;
and rising with population growth until the invasion of American grain allowed&#13;
cheaper food to coexist with rising population after the 1870s. The rental&#13;
price of land, in terms of days of labor, also rose as the population grew&#13;
from the early 1500s to the 1610s. Both population and the rent-wage ratio&#13;
stagnated across part of the seventeenth century (see World Development Report&#13;
1984, Box 4.2, 57).&#13;
The Malthusian idea that movements in real wage rates should bring&#13;
corresponding movements in fertility fits the long period from the start of&#13;
the Wrigley-Schofield population estimates (1541) to the time Malthus wrote&#13;
(c. 1800). Malthus, of course, formed his theories partly with the help of&#13;
crude impressions about this same early-modern English experience. As for the&#13;
notion that real wage declines should bring slower population growth, the&#13;
available evidence provides only slight support.&#13;
On the other hand, both before and after the Industrial Revolution,&#13;
income differentials widened during periods of fast population growth.&#13;
Movements of the share accruing to the top 20 percent of income-earning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
households suggest some correlation with population growth. Between 1688 and&#13;
1759, population growth was not rapid (about 0.3 percent per annum) and the&#13;
income share of the top 20 percent of households declined. Between 1759 and&#13;
1801/03, or across the start of the industrial age in England, population grew&#13;
more rapidly (nearly 0.9 percent annually) and the share of income accruing to&#13;
the top quintile of households rose from 53.8 to 63.1 percent (Lindert and&#13;
Williamson L983). Rapid population growth, that is, at a rate of 1.3 percent&#13;
per annum, and a continuing high level of inequality followed in the period&#13;
1801/03 to L867, the next available benchmark year for data on income&#13;
distribution. After 1867, the benchmark data do not show the same&#13;
correlations: from 1867 to 1880 population growth continued as rapidly as&#13;
before yet the share of income going to the richest households dropped. In&#13;
the years 1880-1913 the share of the richest rose even though the rate of&#13;
population growth slowed slightly to 1.2 percent annually. These facts taken&#13;
together thus offer only partial support to the hunch that rapid population&#13;
growth can cause income inequality to increase.&#13;
Mortality rose and fell with climatic variations; declines in&#13;
mortality lay behind each acceleration of population growth which in turn&#13;
augmented labor supply (Lee 1973). Epidemics were also important (McNeill&#13;
1976). The main factors affecting mortality variations appear to have been&#13;
neither improvements in medicine nor increases in income. A careful&#13;
econometric analysis covering data for the period 1661 to 1871 shows that hot&#13;
summers raLsed the crude death rate by one point for each extra degree&#13;
centigrade above the average, probably by letting infectious micro-organisms&#13;
flourish. Colder winters were also lethal, with 0.38 more deaths per thousand&#13;
for each depree of drop in minimum monthly temperature. In contrast,&#13;
variations Ln living standards appear to have left little or no mark on&#13;
mortality (Lindert EEH 1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Downward pressure on wages emanated from any increase in labor&#13;
supply. (Even in the United States since 1870, extra fertility has affected&#13;
the size and quality of the labor force in ways that raise income&#13;
inequalities. The fertility rate has been the primary factor affecting&#13;
long-term changes in income distribution (Lindert 1978, 258)). This&#13;
Malthusian syndrome, affecting income inequality and the extent of poverty&#13;
more than income growth per se, may be much like current experience in poor&#13;
countries. Complicating factors, such as the unprecedented growth of world&#13;
income and product, 1950-80, disguise the Malthusian trap today. The downward&#13;
pressure on real wages, in effect, lies hidden from view in current&#13;
statistics.&#13;
II. The industrial age&#13;
The technology of the agricultural age took nearly 10,000 years to&#13;
cover the globe. In less than 200 years, the technology of the industrial age&#13;
has already reached every continent. That technology has permitted humankind&#13;
to gain control over vast sources of inanimate energy (Cipolla 1970). But at&#13;
its heart the process of industrialization and economic development is&#13;
intellectual: it consists in the acquisition and application of a corpus of&#13;
knowledge concerning technique, that is, ways of doing things (Landes 1980,&#13;
111). A critical difference between this age and all previous time is that&#13;
since the early phase of modern economic growth, levels of living for groups&#13;
other than elites have improved. Moreover, governments have come to accept&#13;
responsibility for improving levels of living for all the governed. The&#13;
principles of governance, rooted in people's expectation of government, have&#13;
changed irreversibly with the advent of the industrial age.&#13;

The gap between rich and poor, 1800-1980. When the industrial age&#13;
started, Europe already produced 1.5 to 3.5 times as much on a per capita&#13;
basis as did Asia, Africa, and Latin America (see Table 4). A significant&#13;
part of this higher productivity was due to Europe's dependency rate, the&#13;
ratio of children and the elderly to working-age population, being lower than&#13;
other regions. With more workers per capita, output per capita could be&#13;
higher even if output per worker were exactly the same in all regions.&#13;

Source: Based on Tables A-1 to A-5.&#13;
At the start of the industrial age, as many as a fifth of women in&#13;
northwest Europe never married; at any given time, only half of all women aged&#13;
fifteen to fifty were married (Flinn 1982). The mean age at marriage was&#13;
above twenty-five in Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Scandinavia&#13;
throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The poor in&#13;
particular were forced to postpone marriage. In England and Sweden the&#13;
landless married later than those who owned land. Marriage occurred&#13;
particularly late in Ireland where at the time of the 1871 census half the&#13;
women aged twenty-five to twenty-nine were still unmarried, compared to 36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
percent of English women (Thomas 1973). Ireland's poverty led to late&#13;
marriage and often to spinsterhood. These cultures, unlike the Hindu and&#13;
other Asian cultures which provide for marriage at puberty or before, were&#13;
able to adjust fertility downward through marriage delay as a means to ward&#13;
off poverty.&#13;
Japanese culture was in this respect more like that of northwestern&#13;
Europe than the rest of Asia. Detailed religious records from four Japanese&#13;
villages for periods since the seventeenth century show that crude birth rates&#13;
rarely exceeded thirty per thousand. Mean age at marriage was between&#13;
twenty-two and twenty-five for women; about 40 percent of women aged fifteen&#13;
to forty-four were not married. Marriage rates fluctuated with economic&#13;
conditions: for people in their early 1920s, from as low as 14 percent to as&#13;
high as 80 percent when times were good. Couples had an average of just over&#13;
three children, and mothers tended to be between thirty-two and thirty-eight&#13;
when their last child was born--evidence of conscious control of family size,&#13;
probably by abortion and infanticide (Hanley 1983). When the modern phase of&#13;
economic growth began in Japan after 1868, the Japanese already had&#13;
demographic behavior traits much like those of the industrializing countries&#13;
of Europe, of which marriage delay was the most important. Thus even though&#13;
marital fertility did not decline substantially until after 1950, overall&#13;
fertility was much lower than that of Japan's Asian neighbors.&#13;
Beyond the advantage of a lower dependency burden, there is evidence&#13;
of some growth in product per capita in England, France, and the Low countries&#13;
before 1800 (Rostow 1978). These countries represented only a minority&#13;
fraction of the Europe+ region (including North America, USSR, Japan, and&#13;
Oceania with the plus sign), as identified in Table A-1, which itself&#13;
constituted but 26 percent of world population. Far less than 10 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
world population had embarked on the process of modern economic growth leading&#13;
to higher levels of living by 1800.&#13;
How far in the past are the origins of the now-observable large&#13;
difference in levels of living between world regions? In 1980 the Europe+&#13;
region had a level of per capita product five to twelve times higher than that&#13;
of the weighted average of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The wide range&#13;
derives from the two methods used to make international comparisons of income;&#13;
these are described briefly in the appendix. Either comparison technique&#13;
leads to the conclusion that the gap between rich and poor is large now but&#13;
was not always so large. Table 4 reveals that the gap between world regions&#13;
was much smaller in 1800, near the start of the industrial age, than it is&#13;
today. The gap between Europe+ and the rest of the world grew after 1800,&#13;
particularly in the years 1850-1900. Output per capita grew, slowly at first,&#13;
in Europe+ as industrial techniques spread from England to northwest Europe,&#13;
then to North America, central and eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and&#13;
Japan (Kuznets 1966, Rostow 1978). The slowness of the start of the&#13;
industrial age is illustrated with these period growth rates of per capita&#13;
product for Europe+: 1800-1850, 0.74 percent per annum; 1850-1900, 1.27&#13;
percent; 1900-1950, 1.35 percent, and 1950-1980, 2.8-3.8 percent, depending on&#13;
use of exchange rate or purchasing-power parity measurement techniques (see&#13;
Tables A-2 ancl A-4, panel B). Per capita product growth in the industrial&#13;
countries has been far more rapid in the period since 1950 than it ever was&#13;
before. This is true in large part because the techniques and innovations of&#13;
the industrial age were spread throughout the whole of the economies of&#13;
Europe+ only in these more recent decades. East and southeast Europe were&#13;
sufficiently backward in the 1940s to inspire the article now widely regarded&#13;
as the initial work in the field of development economics (Rosenstein-Rodan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
1943). It bears emphasis, however, that this recent period of rapid growth&#13;
for the industrial countries, 1950-80, was also a period of rapid growth for&#13;
Asia, Africa, and Latin America: The rich-poor gap was about the same in 1950&#13;
as it was in 1980. The gap is thus not attributable to events since 1950;&#13;
moreover, the gap has not grown because of growth in the industrial countries&#13;
(Cf. Berry and Bourguignon 1983; Kravis, Heston, and Summers 1982 and 1984).&#13;
The increase in the gap between 1800 and 1950 is mostly due to growth&#13;
in Europe+. There was, however, a sustained slow decline in per capita&#13;
product in East and Southeast Asia (Perkins 1969, 1975) from 1800 to 1900 and&#13;
virtual stagnation from 1900-1950. Myrdal distinguished spread and backwash&#13;
effects--those side-effects of industrial development in Euirope that either&#13;
promoted or inhibited progress elsewhere (Myrdal 1957.) It would take this&#13;
paper too far afield to discuss these effects. The decline in China in the&#13;
nineteenth century was entirely derived from agricultural production estimates&#13;
on a per capita basis and thus was probably occurring independent of any&#13;
negative effects of European development. In contrast, stagnation in Java&#13;
(Ceertz 1963); declines recorded in some Latin American countries (McGreevey&#13;
1965); and the small improvements, 1870-1910, followed by worsening conditions&#13;
in twentieth century India (Kumar 1983), have all been attributed, rightly or&#13;
wrongly, to trade between these economies and Europe (Cf. Hobsbawm 1968).&#13;
In none of the world's six major regions did gross product increase&#13;
at a rate above 3 percent per annum for any extended period before 1950 (see&#13;
Tables A-2 and A-4). Conversely, in no world region did it grow at a rate&#13;
slower than 3 percent in the 1950-80 period. No region's population grew at a&#13;
rate above 1.4 percent annually before 1950; only Europe+ grew annually in&#13;
population by less than 2 percent per annum, 1950 to 1980. Per capita product&#13;
also grew at far faster rates for all major regions after 1950 than it had&#13;
before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

If regional development follows the low-growth pattern foreseen as&#13;
one possibiLity in World Bank projections through 1995 (World Development&#13;
Report, 1984, Table 3.1, 35), then the gap between rich and poor will shrink&#13;
somewhat. This result is, however, simply the result of assuming that Europe+&#13;
CDP will grow by 2.5 percent a year, that of the developing countries, by 4.7&#13;
percent. With more rapid growth of the world economy, the gap would widen&#13;
slightly. The difficulties of effectively absorbing the growing labor force,&#13;
1980-2000, in the developing countries, could cause a further widening of the&#13;
gap between rich and poor not anticipated in the estimates presented in&#13;
Table 4. SLuch demographic economic interactions can perhaps best be&#13;
anticipated by examining those which occurred in the past transformations of&#13;
the now-developed countries.&#13;
The demographic transition. Three decades ago the theory offered to&#13;
explain the demographic and economic transition which began after 1800 might&#13;
have been stated in this simple way: Economic conditions improve. Mortality,&#13;
as a result of these better conditions, begins to fall. Fertility adjusts&#13;
downward to the new lower level of mortality to arrive at the slower, or zero,&#13;
rate of population growth that prevailed before economic conditions began to&#13;
improve. Because the gains from better economic conditions are not eaten up&#13;
by larger populations, levels of living rise continuously into the future (Cf.&#13;
United Nations 1973, 58-63).&#13;
This syllogism has not been amply supported by the facts. For&#13;
example, the industrial age began in England, but the fertility transition&#13;
first appeared in France. One review of European experience recently&#13;
completed found no correlations between mortality, fertility, and development&#13;
indicators (van de Walle and Knodel 1980). However, a close look at English&#13;
experience suggests an explanation for delay in the demographic transition.&#13;

And the early decline in French fertility can be attributed to a congeries of&#13;
factors that includes the French Revolution and changes it caused in rural&#13;
France's economy. Recent analyses also help identify changes not easily&#13;
captured by socioeconomic indicators that link fertility and mortality to&#13;
structural change of the economy, particularly changing demand and supply for&#13;
labor in agriculture.&#13;
Reconsiderations of the demographic transition point increasingly to&#13;
changing costs and benefits of children as important determinants of the&#13;
timing and swiftness of fertility decline (Caldwell 1982). When children no&#13;
longer return benefits to their parents but instead cost more than they yield&#13;
over parental lifetimes, parents voluntarily decide to have fewer children.&#13;
The changing structure of the economy, moreover, alters the advantages of many&#13;
versus few children, and educated versus uneducated children. Formal&#13;
schooling and opportunities for upward mobility into modern-sector jobs&#13;
depress fertility.&#13;
Many factors influence the benefits and costs of children to their&#13;
families. In rural areas children contribute by their work around house and&#13;
farm from their fifth year of age ownward. In contrast, urban families have&#13;
relatively little in the way of work opportunities for children. In rural&#13;
areas where literacy and schooling have not taken hold, additional family&#13;
members beyond the first two or three are easy to accommodate. Elder&#13;
siblings, particularly the girls, relieve the mother's burden of child care.&#13;
Large rural families can achieve a division of labor between children, finding&#13;
those tasks suitable for each age and sex of child, from tending small animals&#13;
and home gardens to heavy work in planting and harvesting. Even landless&#13;
households can usually find work for children in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
With the onset of literacy, urbanization and required schooling, the&#13;
role of children within the household alters drastically. They can no longer&#13;
be dependecl upon as a source of reliable labor. They cost more to the&#13;
household because their productive period is put off almost to the end of&#13;
their stay at home. Children can continue to be a source of comfort and&#13;
security in old age, even in advanced industrial societies, but the weakening&#13;
of family obligations makes it less certain that the elderly can depend on&#13;
their chilcLren for economic assistance (Cf. Shorter 1975, 269-280). Their&#13;
more immediate benefits in work contributed evaporate with required schooling&#13;
and the attenuation of family obligations.&#13;
As the nuclear family replaces extended and complex family forms, as&#13;
achieved status replaces ascriptive status due to family of birth, and as&#13;
schooling for individual contribution replaces the apprenticeship of son to&#13;
father, the benefits parents receive and hence, fertility, seem inevitably to&#13;
fall. These changes can occur to some extent without increases in income and&#13;
in level of living. Economic development as such is neither a sufficient nor&#13;
a necessary condition for the demographic transition to occur.&#13;
The British case. The industrial age began long before the&#13;
demographic transition took hold in England. The main inventions in cotton&#13;
textiles, iron manufacture, the use of steam power, and the factory system&#13;
date from the 1770s. As noted earlier, fertility was lower in England, and&#13;
throughout western Europe, at that time, than it was in Muslim, Hindu, and&#13;
Confucian cultures, because of marriage delay and high rates of spinsterhood.&#13;
Throughout Europe northwest of a line drawn between Trieste and Kiev, women&#13;
married only in their late twenties, and many did not marry at all (Hajnal in&#13;
Glass and Eversley 1965, 101-143; Flinn 1982). Nonetheless, marital fertility&#13;
was as high in Europe as it was in the other culture areas. In England and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Wales, marital fertility did not begin to decline until the 1890s (Coale and&#13;
Watkins 1985). Analysts thus date the commencement of the industrial age from&#13;
about 1780 and the demographic transition from about 1890, leaving a gap&#13;
between the two of more than a century.&#13;
Two features of the economic-demographic link need explaining:&#13;
(1) Why did fertility not rise with higher income? And (2) if a new&#13;
development-fertility link was established, why was the fertility decline so&#13;
long delayed?&#13;
Over the course of the eighteenth century, English per capita product&#13;
rose on average 0.25 percent per annum but with little notable change in the&#13;
levels of consumption of most of the population. The gains helped raise&#13;
savings and investment relative to total output. The growth rate accelerated&#13;
to over 1 percent per annum, 1800-1910 (Lindert 1983). That rate is slow by&#13;
post-1950 standards, but it was unique--the first instance of sustained growth&#13;
of per capita product. Up to about 1820, as growth slowly accelerated, farm&#13;
laborers and unskilled workers experienced no increases in wages and levels of&#13;
consumption.  It was only after that date that wages began to rise at a&#13;
sustained rate, 1820-51, of 1.6 percent per annum for farm workers, 2 percent&#13;
for blue-collar workers, and 2.9 percent for all workers.    The gains were&#13;
substantial, but they went preferentially to high-income earners (Lindert and&#13;
Williamson 1983).&#13;
From 1200 to about 1815, the period for which records exist, higher&#13;
real wages led to more marriages and higher fertility. After 1815, in&#13;
contrast to 600 years of previous experience, fertility did not rise. It did&#13;
not fall right away either, but the Malthusian vicious circle had been, if not&#13;
broken, at least made less vicious. There was a new response to improved&#13;
levels of living.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Several changes that occurred in England and Wales after 1815 shed&#13;
light on the question of why fertility did not rise with the growth of per&#13;
capita product. The process of growth was transforming the economic role of&#13;
children. In the mostly-rural England of the eighteenth century, an extra&#13;
child brought in much more earnings, mainly in cottage industry, than caring&#13;
for the child took away from the earnings of other family members. Then, any&#13;
tendency for wages to rise enhanced children's contribution to family income&#13;
and fertility did rise somewhat (Wrigley and Schofield 1981). As the&#13;
nineteenth century progressed, couples came to rely less and less on their&#13;
children's earnings. By 1850 higher wages brought little net earnings from an&#13;
extra child (Lindert 1983, 141).&#13;
What explains the delay in response of mortality and marital&#13;
fertility to economic growth? Consumption levels for the bulk of the&#13;
population did not begin to improve until after 1820, forty years after the&#13;
major inventions of the industrial age were already in use. The first-fruits&#13;
of the industrial age went preferentially to profits, thence, to savings, and&#13;
only secondarily to higher consumption. When wages did begin to rise, it was&#13;
upper and middle-income groups that captured the lion's share of the benefits&#13;
of higher aggregate productivity (Lindert and Williamson 1983, 24-25).&#13;
Investments in human capital were concentrated among a few at the top of the&#13;
income scale. In 1851 only 8 percent of primary school-age children were&#13;
enrolled in school. (Enrollment rates rose thereafter reaching 50 percent by&#13;
1880 and 75 percent by 1910.) Schooling did not get the emphasis it received,&#13;
for example, in Germany where the primary enrollment rate was 64 percent in&#13;
1871 and rose steadily thereafter (Tan and Haines 1983, 78).&#13;
For the nineteenth century as a whole agricultural productivity per&#13;
worker grew more slowly in the United Kingdom than in all but two (Russia and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Spain) of eleven countries included in one study (see Table 5). Slow growth&#13;
and unequal distribution of the benefits of development help explain delays in&#13;
England's demographic transition. England paid the penalty of being first by&#13;
moving more slowly, and with greater delay in initiation of the demographic&#13;
transition than did the follower countries in northern and eastern Europe.&#13;
This conclusion can be compared with Gerschenkron's finding about the effect&#13;
of relative backwardness on the pace and timing of economic change among the&#13;
European countries: "The development of a backward country may, by the very&#13;
virtue of its backwardness, tend to differ fundamentally from that of an&#13;
advanced country" (Gerschenkron 1962, 7). The pace of industrialization, once&#13;
it began, was faster the more backward the country relative to those which had&#13;
already advanced. England, being first, was one of the slowest.&#13;

Francophone Europe. In England, but to a greater extent in areas of&#13;
French language and culture, some nineteenth-century families realized the&#13;
advantages of having fewer but better-educated children. French demographers,&#13;
starting with Dumont in the nineteenth century, attribute the early decline in&#13;
marital fertility there to 'social capillarity,' or upward social mobility of&#13;
one's children associated with their schooling and entry into the liberal&#13;
professions (Aries 1980, 647, United Nations 1973, 90-91). Once some families&#13;
began limiting their family size, their neighbors came, over the decades, to&#13;
emulate them in the new patterns of fertility and family life. Purely&#13;
economic conditions, such as the structural shift out of agriculture, or the&#13;
level of per capita product, seem less important in the spread of the small-&#13;
family norm than were factors such as language and cultural empathy that aided&#13;
private communication. These factors may have been important because the&#13;
methods to achieve birth control had to be communicated privately and thus did&#13;
not easily cross over language and cultural barriers (Cf. Freedman 1979).&#13;
Fertility began to fall in France at about the time of the French&#13;
Revolution when mortality was still high. Parish records show that families&#13;
in some villages were small enough to indicate that parents were deliberately&#13;
controlling fertility. Most women continued to have their first two babies&#13;
within the expected interval of two to three years. Soon after the French&#13;
Revolution in 1789, however, the intervals between the second and third, but&#13;
especially between the third and the fourth, lengthened substantially (Weir&#13;
1982). The departments of central France were thus among the first to record&#13;
substantial and unreversed declines in marital fertility. One result was the&#13;
far lower birth rates, little higher than death rates, shown for France from&#13;
the mid-n,ineteenth century onward in Figure 4.1, p. 59, of the World&#13;
Development Report, 1984. The decline was not restricted only to the educated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
since in seventy-nine departments for which data are available, only one in&#13;
four persons marrying was able even to sign the parish register in the period&#13;
1786-90 (Cipolla 1968). Just what factors may be responsible for the spread&#13;
of this new way of behaving has long been a subject of study. The French&#13;
Revolution could have promoted upward social mobility; it brought new&#13;
aspirations to the fore, including emphasis on the education of children; it&#13;
reduced allegiance to religious norms and legitimized individual choice. On a&#13;
more practical level, the Napoleonic Code changed inheritance customs by&#13;
ending the practice of primogeniture (all land to the eldest son) thus forcing&#13;
rural families to reduce fertility to assure that landholdings could pass&#13;
intact to the next generation. Whatever the specific reasons adduced to&#13;
explain the decline in French fertility, a remarkable feature of it was its&#13;
spread beyond the educated and urban to permeate French rural life. As&#13;
England's industrial revolution was unique, so France's family and fertility&#13;
behavior was unique and perhaps of equal importance in the economic&#13;
demographic transition.&#13;
A map of Europe developed by the European fertility project, at&#13;
Princeton University's Office of Population Research, shows when marital&#13;
fertility first began to decline in each of more than 600 provinces (see Box&#13;
4.3 in World Development Report, 1984, p. 62). France led with fertility&#13;
declining in most departments before 1830. The rest of France, French-&#13;
speaking Belgium, the French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, Catalonia, and&#13;
some provinces of Hungary followed in the next few decades. Before 1880&#13;
fertility had fallen in only a few other provinces in Germany, Denmark,&#13;
Latvia, Serbia, the Swedish island of Gotlands, and St. Petersburg in Russia.&#13;
The main transition. These early provinces were exceptional in&#13;
Europe. Most provinces did not start the fertility transition until after&#13;
1880. All but a few had begun the transition before 1930. About 60 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
of the provinces began their fertility declines in the interval between 1890&#13;
and 1920. Late declines occurred in Ireland and in the southern and eastern&#13;
periphery of Europe, in Russia, Rumania, Albania, southern Italy, Spain, and&#13;
Portugal.&#13;
Several observations suggested in an essay by Paul Demeny about&#13;
European fertility decline illuminate the transition process:&#13;
o    Fertility and nuptiality differentials lend themselves to plausible&#13;
interpretation as being influenced by such socioeconomic factors as the costs&#13;
and benefits of children, opportunities for quality/quantity tradeoffs .n&#13;
investing in human capital, and opportunities for social mobility;&#13;
o    The onset of fertility decline has occurred under widely varying&#13;
demographic and socioeconomic conditions: no simple set of necessary&#13;
preconditions has been established;&#13;
o    The timing of the onset of fertility decline shows strong evidence of&#13;
diffusion processes through geographic proximity and along linguistic and&#13;
cultural continuities;&#13;
o    T,he later the onset of the fertility decline the more rapid was the&#13;
decline;&#13;
o    Once decline begins it has proven to be irreversible and tends to&#13;
gather speed before decelerating toward low levels;&#13;
o    Below replacement levels of fertility have been achieved without&#13;
recourse to modern methods of birth control (Demeny in Coale and Watkins&#13;
1985).&#13;
A few countries, particularly those in Scandinavia, neatly fit the&#13;
demographic transition theory. For Francophone Europe the fertility decline&#13;
was too early; for England, Germany, and Austria it was too late relative to&#13;
economic development and mortality change. Other factors intervened: These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
included religion, secularism, and social norms; structural characteristics of&#13;
the economy that affected the distribution of the benefits of development; and&#13;
a host of community characteristics still only partially understood&#13;
(Lesthaeghe 1983).&#13;
In the three decades between 1890 and 1920 the other European&#13;
countries were catching up with England in terms of industrial production per&#13;
capita. Between 1860 and 1913, UK industrial production per capita rose by 80&#13;
percent whereas that of Europe as a whole rose by 165 percent. The pace of&#13;
change was particularly rapid in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United&#13;
States.&#13;
The growing productivity of agriculture and the resultant shift of&#13;
population from rural to urban activities was particularly important. Many&#13;
women began to transcend the status of unpaid family worker and went into&#13;
shops and factories. Middle-class families realized that success for their&#13;
children lay in education and professional activities outside agriculture.&#13;
The timing and swiftness of fertility declines varied with the extent to which&#13;
women stopped working at home and children stopped working at all. Where&#13;
these changes occurred but slowly, as in England before 1870, the fertility&#13;
decline was retarded. Even as the agricultural age was drawn to a close by&#13;
the rise of industry, change in life on farms, particularly the lives of women&#13;
and children, proved to be a critical determinant of the timing and pace of&#13;
the demographic transition.&#13;
A comparison of Sweden and Japan. The economic-demographic changes&#13;
which occurred throughout the developed countries in the nineteenth and early&#13;
twentieth centuries may be illustrated by the cases of Sweden and Japan,&#13;
recently examined in some depth (Caldwell 1982, Hanley 1983, Mosk 1983, and&#13;
Schultz 1984).   Sweden passed through the demographic transition between 1890&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
and 1920; marital fertility fell quickly in Japan in the 1950s. Despite many&#13;
obvious difEerences these two countries shared one characteristic critical to&#13;
change: Thie dissolution of a patriarchal system. In both countries the male&#13;
parent largely controlled his wife's and children's behavior through bequests,&#13;
dowries, and his ability to arrange marriages and jobs. The patriarch could&#13;
extract benefits from his children for himself and to maintain the family&#13;
system (Mosk 1983). That ability depended on the absence of alternatives to&#13;
farm-family work. As opportunities grew, patriarchal power dissolved and&#13;
fathers couLd no longer benefit from high fertility.&#13;
The story, in stylized form, unfolded as follows: The patriarchal&#13;
system was undermined by the expansion of education, which offered job&#13;
certification independent of the patriarch, and by the growth of labor&#13;
markets, which offered alternatives to the children and diminished the&#13;
patriarch's control. Schooling, and jobs gotten independently, changed the&#13;
relative bargaining positions of patriarch, wife, sons, and daughters.&#13;
Innovations in farm techniques led to greater per worker productivity in&#13;
agriculture and diminished the need for farm family labor. Overall, the new&#13;
alternatives for children, and the reduced demand for their services by&#13;
parents, reduced the economic advantages of children. Fertility decline was a&#13;
predictable response to these changed conditions.&#13;
Both Japan and Sweden employed 70 percent or more of their labor&#13;
force in agriculture in the 1880s, at the onset of the early phase of modern&#13;
economic growth. They were thus predominantly rural and had the separateness&#13;
of markets characteristic of distance and limited communications. Output per&#13;
worker in both Swedish and Japanese agriculture grew over two percent per&#13;
annum between 1870 and 1970, helping to dislodge farm workers from their&#13;
occupations and inducing outmigration from rural areas. Swedes left for the&#13;

6 shows that in Sweden, marital fertility fell about 2.5 percent per annum&#13;
from 1900 to 1930, the main era of the fertility transition in that country.&#13;
Marital fertility fell later and much faster in Japan--by 5.5 percent per&#13;
annum between 1950 and 1960 (Mosk 1983, 65, 69, 84). The Japanese fertility&#13;
decline occurred in the same decade with the most rapid rise in worker&#13;
productivity in Japanese agriculture. Productivity growth in agriculture was&#13;
particularly important in the early phase of modern economic growth when most&#13;
families still lived and worked in rural areas.&#13;
The pace of change, associated with the early phase of modern&#13;
economic growth in follower countries like Japan and Sweden, set the stage for&#13;
rapid social change which in turn caused the fertility transition:&#13;
o    Change in farm productivity, production techniques, and demand for&#13;
agricultural products initiated and influenced the timing and pace of, the&#13;
initial phases of fertility decline;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

o    A breakdown of rural patriarchal control occurred as sons and&#13;
daughters no longer looked to parents to decide who will be their spouse and&#13;
what will be their job;&#13;
o    Occupational opportunities outside agriculture came to depend less on&#13;
learning traditional techniques than on learning skills for new occupations in&#13;
secondary an(i tertiary sectors;&#13;
o    Ascriptive task assignment (son of owner becomes manager, son of&#13;
fieldworker becomes fieldworker) gave way to achievement of job placement by&#13;
means of creclentials and accomplishments, particularly in formal schooling;&#13;
o    Child obligations to parents, either in late adolescence or parental&#13;
old age, lessened because of the attenuation of social relations arising from&#13;
greater physical and social distance;&#13;
o    Rising status of women, the high costs of children, and job&#13;
alternatives dependent on formal schooling began to take on greater importance&#13;
at higher income levels--in Sweden after 1910, in Japan after 1950. Note,&#13;
however, that even after reaching low levels in the 1960s, fertility fell even&#13;
further in Sweden in the 1970s;&#13;
o    Parental needs also may have declined as better health compensated&#13;
for greater longevity among parents and systems of social security replaced&#13;
family assistance.&#13;
These demographic-economic changes occur slowly, or not at all, if rural life&#13;
does not chan,ge. Agriculture continues to employ two-thirds or more of all&#13;
male workers, a larger share of women, and a still larger share of total&#13;
population lives in rural areas of low-income countries. Without change in&#13;
farming and animal husbandry, change emanating from urban areas will but&#13;
slowly change the countryside and its fertility habits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. Agriculture in the industrial age&#13;
A critical feature of the industrial age was that agricultural&#13;
productivity expanded virtually as fast as manufacturing productivity in the&#13;
early phase of modern growth. For four countries (Great Britain, Norway, the&#13;
United States, and Canada) the trend of per worker product in agriculture was&#13;
identical to countrywide per-worker product. In the Netherlands, Denmark, and&#13;
Australia, productivity in the agricultural sector increased at a rate&#13;
somewhat faster than economywide productivity. In France, Sweden, Italy,&#13;
USSR, and Japan, agricultural productivity grew at two-thirds or more the&#13;
speed of economywide productivity (Kuznets 1966, 113-127).&#13;
Such a growth rate is essential, even if the income-elasticity of&#13;
demand for agricultural products is low, because per-worker product grew so&#13;
fast in the nonagricultural sectors. Without rapid agricultural productivity&#13;
growth, that sector would have constituted a drag on growth because it would&#13;
have required more resource inputs than it in fact absorbed. As the growth&#13;
process evolved, substantial resources were freed from agriculture to shift to&#13;
manufacturing and service sectors.&#13;
For all the countries mentioned above, the fertility rates of rural&#13;
areas were higher than urban rates. In the 1830s and 1840s in the United&#13;
States, for example, rural fertility rates were about 70 percent higher than&#13;
urban rates, and death rates in rural areas were somewhat lower than in urban&#13;
areas. Without migration, the observed fertility differentials would have&#13;
yielded growth rates for rural populations as much as triple those for urban&#13;
populations. Despite these differences in vegetative growth rates, the share&#13;
of the labor force in agriculture declined in the twelve cases of growth&#13;
observed. That decline was made possible by a massive migration out of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
agriculture. That migration disrupted family relations and prompted much&#13;
lower fertility.&#13;
About 50 million persons left Europe in the early phase of the&#13;
industrial age and migrated to open territories in the Americas and Oceania.&#13;
They came first, and in greatest numbers, from England and Wales, the first&#13;
country to industrialize; then successively from the rest of northwestern&#13;
Europe, and later still from southern and eastern Europe. The migrations were&#13;
concentrated in the century from about 1815 to 1914. The numbers migrating&#13;
equaled about one-sixth of the European population of 1900 (Cf. Swamy 1985 for&#13;
summary data and references). An equal number, but a far smaller percentage,&#13;
left mainland China and India to open up tropical regions of the world to&#13;
plantation agriculture (Lewis 1978). Most Asian immigrants left as indentured&#13;
servants to bujild the commerical infrastructure of open territories in&#13;
Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Their numbers were insufficient to&#13;
have the impact on demographic history in the countries of origin which the&#13;
European migrations had. Immigration was a safety valve for rural Europe&#13;
providing a productive alternative to parcelization and increased density. In&#13;
Asia migration could have played a similar role, but it was too small relative&#13;
to the sending population to have much effect on density, land use, or&#13;
wages. Enslaved Africans were moved in greatest numbers to the Americas&#13;
between 1780 atnd 1820. If about 8 million were forced to migrate in the&#13;
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and if Africa's population was 100&#13;
million in 180C0, then that 8 percent of the African population moved may have&#13;
been more nearly similar in demographic impact to that of Asia than of Europe&#13;
(Curtin 1969, 268). But slave movements to America brought manioc and maize&#13;
in return from the Americas so that, Curtin writes, "Population growth&#13;
resulting from new food crops exceeded population losses through the slave&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
trade... [T]he net demographic effect of the three Atlantic migrations was&#13;
population growth, not decline" (Curtin 1969, 270,271).&#13;
How differently population change proceeded in industrializing and&#13;
less developed regions shows up in urbanization rates. For currently more&#13;
developed regions, the urban percentage in total population rose from 17&#13;
percent in 1875 to 70 percent in 1975. Over the same century-long period in&#13;
the currently less developed regions, it rose from 5 percent to 27 percent&#13;
with most of the rise concentrated in the period since 1950 (Graumann 1977,&#13;
32). The low-income countries became somewhat more urbanized as a result of&#13;
growing participation in international trade, the fall in transport costs, and&#13;
the economies of concentration in port and capital cities. By this measure of&#13;
structural change, however, the pace of improvement was far faster in&#13;
developed than in less developed countries.&#13;
International migrations during the early phase of the industrial age&#13;
left administrative records of their quantitative dimensions. By statistical&#13;
analysis one can estimate the much larger net movements from rural to urban&#13;
areas within the industrializing countries (Cf. Eldridge and Thomas 1964, for&#13;
use of census survival techniques). These movements totaled at least 50&#13;
million between 1875 and 1900; 105 million, 1900-25, 120 million, 1925-50, and&#13;
180 million, 1950-75 (calculated on the basis of Graumann 1977, 32, Table&#13;
10). Since the start of the twentieth century, these internal population&#13;
movements have constituted 25 percent or more of rural population at the start&#13;
of each quarter-century period.&#13;
Migration was highly selective with respect to age and, in many&#13;
cases, to sex. Most migrants were aged fifteen to thirty-four, and male. The&#13;
movement of young men out of agriculture probably disrupted anticipated&#13;
benefits their fathers expected to derive from sons who no longer remained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
near home. The two migrations--out of the industrializing countries to&#13;
open territc,ries, and out of rural areas of those countries to their&#13;
cities--changed the supply of labor in agriculture and in doing so changed&#13;
the expected costs and benefits of having children. Changes in both migration&#13;
and fertility behavior were caused by the rise in labor productivity of&#13;
agriculture in the early phase of modern economic growth. This rise in&#13;
productivity was perhaps more important than the more obvious improvements in&#13;
worker productivity in manufacturing industry.&#13;
Manufacturing industry in England was the most visible fe3ture of&#13;
growth, but agricultural productivity was already high and growing. At the&#13;
start of the nineteenth century, only a third of English laborers were still&#13;
working in agriculture. In 1850 England was still the only country with 50&#13;
percent or less of its work force in primary production (Bairoch in Cipolla&#13;
1973, 468). The transition away from farming, begun in a few places early in&#13;
the nineteenth century, was slow to spread because the pace of growth was&#13;
slow. Late-comers to the process in northern and eastern Europe began to&#13;
catch up with the leaders, both in economic development and in fertility&#13;
decline, by moving through the economic-demographic transition far faster than&#13;
had England and France.&#13;
The transformation of rural life was the most important factor in&#13;
bringing about changes in the costs and benefits of children. On the European&#13;
continent one in three rural dwellers was caught up in the early phase of&#13;
change to a cottage-industrial system in the nineteenth century (Shorter 1975,&#13;
258). Most British textile entrepreneurs came of modest origins and often of&#13;
farming stock (Mantoux 1961, 183, 370). The disruptions to rural life caused&#13;
by increased productivity was the mechanism which changed farmer prospects by&#13;
making rural life no longer attractive economically for many. Growth of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
productivity released factors of production throwing unproductive farmers, and&#13;
farmers' children, out of work. As those children moved on to other&#13;
occupations outside the rural sector, the benefits parents could derive from&#13;
children decreased. The flow of benefits from child to parent probably&#13;
reversed in many families. That reversal may have been more powerful than&#13;
increasing school attendance, improved health conditions, or higher child&#13;
survival rates in speeding the transition to lower fertility (Cf. Caldwell&#13;
1982). The following examples illustrate how the mechanism could have worked.&#13;
There are two ways in which an oversupply of labor may occur on a&#13;
family farm. The first way to consider is that mortality falls leaving the&#13;
household with more sons and daughters surviving to work the land. As their&#13;
numbers multiply over the decades the necessary divisions of the land to give&#13;
each a property share will increase. This process is obviously slow; it could&#13;
hardly induce efforts to restrict labor supply via the rapid declines in&#13;
fertility observed during demographic transition. Empirically, mortality and&#13;
fertility are only loosely related. A review of the timing of mortality and&#13;
fertility change in eight countries over long periods up to the present&#13;
(England and Wales since 1730, USA since 1790, Russia since 1861, Japan since&#13;
1873, India since 1881, Mexico since 1895, Egypt since 1906, and Taiwan,&#13;
province of China, since 1920) shows only a very loose relationship between&#13;
the two vital rates (Lindert in Easterlin 1980, 7-12).&#13;
A second, and more important, source of labor redundancy is&#13;
innovation leading to greater labor productivity. For example, the horse-&#13;
drawn plough replaced oxen in eighteenth-century England for a savings of more&#13;
than 50 percent in labor time (Bairoch in Cipolla 1973, 465). That innovation&#13;
and many others were adopted in a matter of a few decades (for other examples&#13;
see Birdsall 1984). The savings in labor required a process of resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
reallocation. Workers left farming and animal husbandry for two reasons: (1)&#13;
Demand grew and drew farmworkers into manufacturing and services; (2) Farm&#13;
innovations cut job opportunities on the farms for children who might&#13;
otherwise have worked for their farm-owner parents. In the British case,&#13;
income increases attributable to factor movements (between countryside and&#13;
city, and between farm and nonfarm occupations) were less than 10 percent of&#13;
total income growth (Lindert and Williamson 1983). Britain was first to enter&#13;
the industrial age, but it was slowest in economic transformation and&#13;
productivity growth. The push of labor redundancy in agriculture exceeded the&#13;
pull of labor demand in nonfarm work. Thus significant numbers had to migrate&#13;
from the British Isles for better opportunities in open territories in the&#13;
Americas and Oceania.&#13;
Agricultural productivity grew even faster in many of the follower&#13;
countries of continental Europe than it had in England and Wales. The&#13;
fertility transition was not retarded and resultant rates of per capita&#13;
product growth were significantly higher than those achieved by the English&#13;
(Kuznets 1966, 64-65). Gerschenkron has shown that the more backward a&#13;
country at the time it entered the early phase of economic growth, the swifter&#13;
was its progress. This advantage of backwardness may help explain why the&#13;
fertility transitions in Germany, Scandinavia, and Southeastern Europe&#13;
proceeded so much more quickly than in the English case (Gerschenkron 1962,&#13;
5-32).&#13;
The change in the way many people made their living was rapid and&#13;
dramatic. People experiencing such change involving migration away from&#13;
traditional rural settings had strong motives to limit family size. Thus&#13;
fertility fell quickly (in a matter of decades, that is) once the motivation&#13;
for family limitation was in place. In the United States in 1910 as many as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
70 percent of all married couples were controlling their fertility after three&#13;
live births (Sanderson and David 1983). For countries which had entered the&#13;
industrial age, the period from 1870 to 1913 was one of unprecedented growth&#13;
of per capita product, of structural change out of agriculture and into new&#13;
urban-based activities, and declines in both fertility and mortality (Lewis&#13;
1978, 14-20; Craumann 1977).&#13;
IV. Recent experience of economic-demographic transition&#13;
Economic-demographic changes that could have led to lower fertility&#13;
have occurred in many countries outside Europe+. Some low and middle-income&#13;
countries got an early start in economic development but have had their&#13;
demographic transitions thwarted. A recent review by Reynolds dates the&#13;
turning point to increases in per capita income before 1930 for 24 developing&#13;
countries with 1980 population of five million or more (Reynolds 1983, 958).&#13;
Many of these countries, despite the passage of sixty yers or more since&#13;
development began, still hve very low incomes, as indicated in Table 7.     The&#13;
twelve with lowest incomes, now ranging from $190 to $900, experienced only a&#13;
10 percent decline in fertility, 1960-81. The twelve with higher incomes,&#13;
ranging from $950 to $4,140, brought down fertility by 25 percent over the&#13;
same period. Later starters, with incomes now ranging from $260 to $1,370,&#13;
began to grow only recently (between 1947 and 1965), and had an average&#13;
fertility decline of only 15 percent, 1960-81.&#13;
China stands out in Table 7 as completely exceptional. Despite a low&#13;
income level, fertility declined more than in any country group. Neither low&#13;
income nor the late start in development inhibited China's demographic&#13;
transition. As one result China's population will grow, 1980-2000, at a rate&#13;

development listed in Table 7.&#13;
Development started long ago for a dozen middle-income countries&#13;
which recently experienced fairly rapid fertility decline. These dozen&#13;
countries, with 400 million population in 1982, have many of the structural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
characteristics that suggest they will follow the path of demographic&#13;
transition already tread by the Europe+ populations.    Brazil, for example, the&#13;
largest country in the group, began to experience in the 1970s an absolute&#13;
decline in the number of farm workers, thus signaling presumed changes in the&#13;
benefits of children that induce families to limit births.&#13;
A dozen low-income countries, which started to develop long ago, but&#13;
did not achieve the structural changes that cause fertility to decline, have&#13;
had their development aspirations thwarted, in part at least, by rapid&#13;
population growth. Seven late starters have so far achieved only a modest&#13;
decline in fertility. The Chinese case shows that political commitment can&#13;
substitute for the lack of prior development previously thought necessary to&#13;
permit fertility decline. India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, and the&#13;
Philippines have also achieved large reductions in fertility at low levels of&#13;
income.&#13;
The role of policy. The diversity of experience among these&#13;
thirty-three less developed countries is broadly consistent with the diversity&#13;
already noted among the developed countries. Moreover, two new variables&#13;
affected fertility change in the period since 1950. Governments in developing&#13;
countries have pursued explicit fertility-reduction goals and urged their&#13;
citizens to reduce family size. India began to do so in the 1950s; China,&#13;
with more vigor, and more success, in the 1970s. A second variable was the&#13;
increasing availability and quality of contraceptive methods and services.&#13;
The uneven administration of population policy, and the uneven extension of&#13;
modern contraceptive technologies to potential users are both factors&#13;
explaining (as economic development alone cannot) some of the diversity in&#13;
economic and demographic performance.&#13;
Figure 1 illustrates the tradeoff or substitution which can occur&#13;
between development and population policy as two of the main factors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
influencing fertility. Before 1950 there were no explicit national policies&#13;
to limit fertility; now many developing countries have such policies.&#13;
Figure 1 derives from a statistical analysis linking development,&#13;
population policy, and observed fertility behavior. The share of labor force&#13;
in agriculture is measured on the horizontal access. On the vertical access&#13;
is measured population policy and program as described in the World&#13;
Development Report, 1984 (155-61,200-201). The polygons in the diagram are&#13;
drawn to encompass countries with the indicated fertility ranges. Beginning&#13;
in the upper left-hand corner of the figure, the five countries with TFR=2-2.9&#13;
are in the uppermost polygon. (If data were available on the policy ranking&#13;
of industrial and centrally-planned economies, many of these countries would&#13;
probably appear in a TFR=1-l.9 polygon overlapping and somewhat to the left of&#13;
the uppermost one there now.) Each of the polygons numbered 3 through 8&#13;
includes within its area the countries, respectively, with fertility levels&#13;
TFR=3-3.9 through TFR=8-8.9. The numbers of countries which fall in each&#13;
fertility class is shown at the bottom of the figure; the total number of&#13;
countries for which data are available is 80. The several polygons overlap&#13;
very considerably, a situation consistent with the observation that many&#13;
factors not captured by the two variables of policy and level of development,&#13;
affect current fertility. Even though there is a reasonably high and&#13;
significant correlation in this set of data between fertility and share of&#13;
labor in agriculture (r = +0.7), as well as between fertility and population&#13;
policy (r = +0.xx), the correlation between share of labor in agriculture and&#13;
population policy is low (r = 0.xx). Because these two factors are both&#13;
conceptuaLly and statistically independent, they can substitute for each other&#13;
to yield a range of fertility outcomes.&#13;
Each of the polygons 2 through 7 lies below and to the right of its&#13;
numerical predecessor, despite the substantial overlap already discussed.&#13;

Fertility is lower as both policy becomes more adequate and the share of&#13;
workers on farms declines. But individual countries are not on some single&#13;
track from high to low fertility. The diversity shown in this figure supports&#13;
the conclusion that there is some general tendency linking these three&#13;
variables, but at the same time the figure makes clear that the relationship&#13;
is not simple. The spatial ordering of the polygons 2 through 7 does provide&#13;
limited support for the assertion that development and policy can substitute&#13;
for each other: The polygons are in the correct order from upper left-hand&#13;
corner to lower right.&#13;
Polygon 8 is by this criteria too high as it lies above 7 rather than&#13;
below it. The four countries in that set are Afghanistan, Kenya, Rwanda, and&#13;
Zimbabwe. The last-named country in particular is anomalous in having reached&#13;
a fairly low share of labor in agriculture (60 percent) and a policy level of&#13;
32.6 yet still having among the highest levels of fertility. The reason for&#13;
the anomaly may reside in an unusual degree of segmentation of society and&#13;
inequality.&#13;
Polygons 2, 3, 4, and 7 have the right shape: Each is somewhat&#13;
elongated into a southwest to northeast shape which would be consistent with&#13;
the hypothesis that development and policy substitute for each other. That&#13;
permits two countries to attain the same fertility level with different mixes&#13;
of development and policy. Cuba reaches TFR=2 with a policy score of only&#13;
62.8 and 23 percent of its labor force in agriculture. China reached TFR=2.3&#13;
with 69 percent of its labor force still in agriculture by reason of its&#13;
stringent policies, measured at 101.1 on the policy scale. Polygon 5 is&#13;
distored into a large pyramid by the inclusion of Kuwait in the lower&#13;
left-hand corner. Even without inclusion of Kuwait for reasons of its easily&#13;
explicable lack of a farm labor force, the countries at this fertility level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
do not have a relationship to each other than can be explained by the&#13;
hypothesis of substitution. Burma, the Central African Republic, and Kuwait&#13;
are at the bottom of the polygon, El Salvador at the top. Countries at this&#13;
level of fertility may be in unresolved transition from a state of natural&#13;
fertility to a state of fertility control (El Salvador and Kuwait); in others,&#13;
fertility may be depressed because of disease-related subfecundity (Central&#13;
African Republic) thus bringing a group of countries together for reasons&#13;
unrelated to development and policy as laid out in Figure 1.&#13;
Despite the several anomalies noted above, there is an overall&#13;
confirmation of the posited relationship between fertility, the share of labor&#13;
in agriculture (essentially a development indicator), and the measure of&#13;
effectiveness of population policy. This relationship is statistically&#13;
significant as shown in the following equation (in logs) in which fertility is&#13;
made a function of the share of labor in agriculture and of the country score&#13;
on population policy:&#13;
LogTFR = 1.15 + 0.25 log AGSHARE - 0.14 log POLICY&#13;
(0.04)              (0.03)&#13;
n = 78&#13;
r squared = 0.58&#13;
The two variables explain 58 percent of the variance in fertility. (Note that&#13;
Kuwait, El Salvador, Bangladesh, and Kampuchea were left out of the countries&#13;
included for the regression because of anomalies discussed previously in the&#13;
text. Kuwait's share of labor force in agriculture is not reflective of the&#13;
level of developmentof the economy because of unusual dependence on the export&#13;
sector. Bangladesh and El Salvador are dramatically out of line in terms of&#13;
policy score, perhaps because their levels of policy development are&#13;
inaccurately reported. Kampuchea has a zero policy score; it is not possible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
to use the log of zero.) The standard errors (in parentheses) are acceptably&#13;
low. This statistical analysis complements and fortifies the more qualitative&#13;
discussion of the fertility-level polygons which precedes it.&#13;
The principal new finding is that countries cannot usefully be&#13;
viewed as being on a single path along which all must move at a slower or&#13;
faster pace depending on development prospects and policy commitment.&#13;
Instead, each country is in its unique position with unique constraints and&#13;
opportunities to combine the transformation of its economy with a population&#13;
policy to yield some fertility outcome. There can be a lot of development&#13;
with very little fertility change. Strong policy commitment may still leave&#13;
fertility high--Bangladesh at the top of polygon 6 is the most disturbing&#13;
example. Yet overall the three variables are significantly related to each&#13;
other in this kind of cross-section analysis. It seems to imply that movement&#13;
from each country's unique current point in the three-dimensional space of&#13;
fertility, development, and policy requires moving from the lower right-hand&#13;
corner of Figure 1 (or its three-dimensional analogue) to the upper left-hand&#13;
corner--either more development, or more policy, or some of both. But because&#13;
the polygons are large and overlapping, this figure implies that change among&#13;
the three variables over time need not move smoothly. Thus El Salvador, which&#13;
forms the peak of polygon 5 is within the space of polygons 3 and 4: the&#13;
level of policy effort and of development might then be enough to yield a&#13;
rapid decline of fertility to a lower level. What the catalyst might be to&#13;
cause such a change lies outside the purview of this analysis which in its&#13;
generality can only point out such cases for further reflection and study.&#13;
The analysis of Figure 1 depended on a cross-section of data for the&#13;
early 1980s. It thus doe-s not address changes over time in particular country&#13;
settings. The data in Table 8 and Figure 2 offer the possibility of analyzing&#13;
changes over time in a few selected countries for which information is&#13;

available on vital rates and economic transformation. (For longer periods,&#13;
policy disappears as a pertinent variable inasmuch as it is a very recent&#13;
phenomenon.) Table 8 compares, for selected countries, vital-rate&#13;
improvements with the shift of labor force out of agriculture. The two&#13;
largest low-income countries, China and India, have achieved substantial&#13;
movement along the demographic transition (reductions in both mortality and&#13;
fertility) without significant transformations of their economies.&#13;

For some but not all countries which have moved forward on a path of&#13;
demographic transition, a fundamental shift was simultaneously occurring away&#13;
from traditional agriculture to nonagricultural activities. This shift is&#13;
most readily measured by the decline in the share of labor force working in&#13;
agriculture (Kuznets 1966). The demographic transition is usually conceived&#13;
of as separate declines in death rates and birth rates. However, all societies&#13;
value improvements in both indicators. The sum of changes in birth and death&#13;
rates is an indicator of socially-valued demographic change.&#13;
Figure 2 adopts the unusual practice of relating total demographic&#13;
change (the sum of declines in both birth and death rates) to the economic&#13;
transformation of economies. The proposition giving rise to the figure is&#13;
that the two changes could proceed at similar rates. In some countries change&#13;
in the demographic rates has been similar to the change from agricultural to&#13;
nonagricultural activities. For fourteen of the sixteen countries,&#13;
demographic and economic change proceeded in tandem during the transition.&#13;
Examples include the United States between 1870 and 1920, England and Wales&#13;
between 1800 and 1900, Sweden between 1870 and 1930, and a number of countries&#13;
(Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico among others) in the years since&#13;
1960. Several countries, of which Bangladesh, Kenya, and Pakistan are&#13;
examples, have made relatively little progress on either the demographic or&#13;
economic transitions, as indicated by their positions in the lower left-hand&#13;
corner of the figure.&#13;
A few low-income countries, China most strikingly, India and&#13;
Sri Lanka somewhat less so, have achieved substantial movement along the&#13;
demographic transition (reductions in both mortality and fertility) without&#13;
significant transformations of their economies. This is shown in the figure&#13;
by the positioning of those countries in the upper left-hand corner of the&#13;
figure where demographic change is large but economic transformation is&#13;
slight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The sum of changes in vital rates for China from 1950 to 1980 is 41&#13;
and for India is 47 between 1915 and 1980. The decline in the share of labor&#13;
force in agricultural is 6 and 11 points, respectively for the two&#13;
countries. One explanation for this result is that successful policy&#13;
initiatives aimed at improving the standards of living of poor groups yielded&#13;
greater life expectancy and lower fertility, even without the structural&#13;
transformations brought on with economic development. Policy thus substituted&#13;
for development.&#13;
For most other countries in the figure the index number for economic&#13;
transformatiorn equals or exceeds that of population change. The Japanese&#13;
experience stands out as one in which economic transformation was much greater&#13;
than demographic change, in part because of a long history of late marriage&#13;
and because the transition to lower mortality and fertility occurred farther&#13;
back in Japan's past, as indicated earlier in this paper (Cf. Hanley 1983).&#13;
China and India, when compared to other countries, have achieved far greater&#13;
advances demographically, particularly through declines in death rates, than&#13;
they have economically. If the fourteen countries, other than China and&#13;
India, included in Figure 2 are considered together, the coefficient of&#13;
correlation between their demographic and economic changes is r = + 0.44.&#13;
But when China and India are added to the regression, there is no significant&#13;
relationship remaining between the two variables (r = + 0.02, n = 16).&#13;
These findings suggest that population policy can substitute for&#13;
economic transformation to achieve lower fertility. Political commitment, as&#13;
well as structural change in the economy, offers an escape from the Malthusian&#13;
trap. For the low-income countries, fertility is still so high (CBR = 30 or&#13;
more) that rapid population growth inhibits the rate at which the share of&#13;
labor in agriculture can decline. For most of these countries an effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

population policy may be essential well before any economic transformation can&#13;
occur.&#13;
Korea and India compared. For middle-income economies, South Korea&#13;
is an example of balanced economic-demographic development. There, per worker&#13;
productivity in agriculture, 1960-80, grew by 240 percent, that is, at the&#13;
cumulative annual rate of 6.35 percent. During the twenty-year period the&#13;
share of labor force in agriculture declined from 66 percent to 34 percent&#13;
while the share of agriculture in total product declined from 37 percent to 17&#13;
percent (see Table 9). There was a massive transformation of the economy&#13;
accomplished in those two decades. Transformations of agricultural methods&#13;
were critical to changes in the demand for children. Without those changes&#13;
the prospect that farm households would have decided to have fewer children&#13;
seems uncertain at best.&#13;

The calculations in Table 9 for Korea contrast sharply with those for&#13;
India. They indicate a decline in per worker productivity in Indian&#13;
agriculture during the same period of notable growth for Korea. The absence&#13;
of structural change would appear to be responsible. There has been a&#13;
significant worsening of the land-labor ratio in Indian agriculture.&#13;
Improvements in output per hectare have been bought with more labor-intensive&#13;
cultivation techniques. This difference suggests pessimism about prospects&#13;
for fertility change in India and other countries unable to achieve&#13;
improvements in farm-labor productivity.&#13;
Continuing transformation in Europe+. Despite the early lead in the&#13;
economic-demographic transition among the countries of Europe+, even in recent&#13;
decades, they have continued to experience a more rapid transformation of&#13;
their economies, and a more rapid change of fertility behavior, than have the&#13;
less developed countries. Table 10 demonstrates this difference by showing,&#13;
for the period 1960-82, the percentage change in birth rates and the&#13;

percentage decline in the share of labor force in agriculture for groups of&#13;
countries by income class. For the low-income economies, excluding China,&#13;
birth rates declined by 10 percent in the indicated period, and the share of&#13;
labor force in agriculture decline by 5 percent. Among the industrial&#13;
countries birth rates declined by 67 percent from what were already&#13;
comparatively low levels in 1960, and the share of labor force in agriculture&#13;
declined by 31 percent. Thus the rate of transformation has been far faster&#13;
in the developed than in the less developed countries.&#13;

ANNEX&#13;
Esitimates of income, population, and total product, 1800-2000&#13;
Early in the process of preparing the World Development Report, 1984,&#13;
the team assigned to prepare the report decided to take a long view of&#13;
population change and economic development. One part of that exercise was to&#13;
prepare estimates of the world distribution of population and total product&#13;
from some date near the start of the industrial revolution, the presumed point&#13;
at which income in the now-developed countries began to rise to levels well&#13;
above that of the low-income countries. Income, product, and population data&#13;
are available in reasonably-complete form only for dates since 1950. For all&#13;
earlier periods scholars rely on educated guesses about all the principal&#13;
variables in such a relationship. Systematic estimations drawing on detailed&#13;
accounts of national product have only been made for a few countries, most of&#13;
them among the more developed. Most of these are summarized in various papers&#13;
published by Simon Kuznets (1966, 1979) and, for more recent work, surveys by&#13;
Maddison (1983) and Bairoch in Bairoch and Levy-Leboyer (1981). The world&#13;
estimates of product, population and per capita product contained in Figure&#13;
1.3 in World Development Report, 1984 are the results of the inquiry into&#13;
current practice concerning such estimates. This annex explains how the&#13;
estimates were derived from the existing literature.&#13;
Population, 1800-2000&#13;
Population data are drawn almost entirely, for the period before&#13;
1950, from Durand (see Table 2 of the main text). The source table in&#13;
Durand's article includes population ranges for 12 geographical regions of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
world for 1750, 1900, and 1975. In all cases we calculated the means of the&#13;
ranges and used those as point estimates for the yenirs in question. The&#13;
implicit growth rates between the point estimates f(or 1750 and 1900 were used&#13;
to interpolate estimates for the years 1800 and 18')0 used Table A-1.   Such&#13;
interpolations could Lead to several kinds of error. A review of data which&#13;
this approach yielded, along with a comparison to some other sources,&#13;
including the regional details presented by Durarid, and also McEvedy (1978),&#13;
Maddison (1983 35), and Kumar (1983), did not suggest a basis for any&#13;
substantial change.&#13;
Data for 1950 were taken from Morawet:z (1977, 90-93) which is based&#13;
on World Bank data files.   Several countries wiere not included in the Morawetz&#13;
tables, especially China, which was taken from Maddison (1983, 35).&#13;
Data for 1980 were taken from the 1'983 World Bank Atlas for all&#13;
countries.  Geographic regions vary in minor detail from those used in the&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Countries included in each region for the purposes of this&#13;
report are as follows:&#13;
1.  Europe+ areas of overseas European expansion:   All European&#13;
countries (excluding Turkey), USSR, incltiding Asian parts of USSR; United&#13;
States and Canada; Australia and New Zealand, and Japan.&#13;
2.  South Asia:  India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka,&#13;
and Bhutan.&#13;
3.  East and Southeast Asia:   China, Korea, Philippines, Indonesia,&#13;
Laos, Malaysia, Burma, Thailand, Sinj;apore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Kampuchea.&#13;
4.  Western Asia:   Turkey ind Afghanistan, as well as other Middle&#13;
Eastern countries.&#13;
5.  Africa:  All :ountries of Africa from Egypt on the northeast to&#13;
Morocco on the northwest and South Africa on the southern tip of the&#13;
continent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
6.  Latin America:   All iareas from Mexico south.&#13;
There may remain some discrepancies in the data resulting from shifting&#13;
identifications of areas.   Japan is separated from the rest of East Asia for&#13;
reasons discussed in the text, especially Chapter III.&#13;
Projections of popul4tion to the year 2000 assumed the following&#13;
cumulative annual growth rates:    Europe+, 0.6 percent; South Asia, Western&#13;
Asia, and Africa, 2.5 percent; East and Southeast Asia, 1.2 percent, and Latin&#13;
America, 2.3 percent.   These rates of population growth are broadly consistent&#13;
with World Bank projections for Andividual countries, which make explicit&#13;
assumptions; about paths of mortality and fertility decline explained in World&#13;
Development Report, 1984.&#13;
Per capita income and product, 1800-2000, two methods&#13;
The many problems with estimation of per capita products and their&#13;
comparisons across time and space by nieans of exchange rate or purchasing-&#13;
power-parity conversions to a numerairtt currency have been discussed at length&#13;
(Kravis, Summers and Heston 1982; KraviLs 1984; Marris 1984; Maddison 1983,&#13;
Kravis 198], Kumar 1983, Perkins 1969, 1975, World Bank China Study 1983,&#13;
McCreevey 1965, 1980).   There is no point in repeating here all the potential&#13;
errors, discrepancies, and potential misuriderstandings that might arise from&#13;
such an exercise. A fair generalization it3 that a 'traditional' method based&#13;
on observable exchange rates between currencies is somewhat easier to do, and&#13;
commands readier understanding among most economists, whereas the purchasing-&#13;
power-parity approach is methodologically supterior but is associated with&#13;
numerous data problems and some disagreements.    Both methods are shown here,&#13;
but the exchange-rate method was used for the figure whiich appeared in World&#13;
Development Report, 1984 because more data on more couritries are available for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
that method.  Table A-2 shows estimated and projected per capita product for&#13;
world regions, 1800-2000, based, in principle, on exchang,e-rate based&#13;
calculations of respective products in dollars of 1980 purchasing power.&#13;
The exchange-rate method&#13;
Estimates of per capita product which appear in Table A-2 were made&#13;
on a region-by-region basis.   Existing data on each region wei-e examined for&#13;
consistency and likely accuracy, beginning with the years since 1950.     For the&#13;
years 1950 and 1980 available data are reasonably firnm for all world regions&#13;
although the guesswork multiplies substantially for non-Europe+ regions over&#13;
the rather careful estimates that exist for that area (see note 1).&#13;
The numbers used for 1950 and 1980 were derived eclectically from&#13;
existing data in the World Bank Atlas, the World Development Report Series,&#13;
the World Bank China study, and other official sources.    The 1980 numbers were&#13;
critically important for estimating the 1950 numbers.    For several l-egions we&#13;
used the long-term growth rates of per capita product, 1950-77, from Morawetz&#13;
(1977, 77-80) to extrapolate the 1980 levels backward to 1950.    The resulting&#13;
numbers were checked against each other to see whether the relative Le vels&#13;
seemed about right. The estimate for western Asia in 1950 was lowered&#13;
somewhat as a result of that cross check.&#13;
For periods before 1950 similar backward extrapolations were made but&#13;
using fairly detailed existing estimates as extrapolators for some regions:&#13;
(1) Europe+, Western Asia, and Africa: Bairoch in Bairoch and&#13;
Levy-Leboyer (1981, 12, Maddison (1983));&#13;
(2) Latin Ameri-ca: McGreevey (1965, 98);&#13;
(3) East Asia: Perkins (1969, 1975);&#13;
(4) South Asia, Heston in Kumar (1983, 376-462, esp., 415).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
A partial estimate (ei ther a major component of total product or a total-product&#13;
estimate for one or mc,re countries of a region) going back into the past was&#13;
spliced tco the 1950 and 1980 estimates to yield a credible growth rate for per&#13;
capita product in thEa period before 1950.   The results of these calculations&#13;
appear in Table A-2, panel A.   For several regions even this basis for&#13;
projectioni petered out before the backward projection reached all the way to&#13;
1800.  Some of the details are discussed in following paragraphs.&#13;
Ihe estirriate for East and Southeast Asia, of which China is the&#13;
principal component, begins with the World Bank China study which includes a&#13;
systematic analy.sis of Chinese income levels and growth from 1949 to 1980&#13;
(World Bank 1983 , vol. 1D 39-45, 71-95, and 263-314).   That study places China&#13;
above India but below some other low-income countries and all middle-income&#13;
countries in comparing 1979 levels of real income per capita.    It also prints&#13;
a table on pag;e 43 showing Chinese 1952 income per capita as about 18 percent&#13;
below India's. in 1950.&#13;
The per capita product estimates for 1950 and 1980 thus formed the&#13;
basis for tIle Chinese (and hence all East and Southeast Asian) per capita&#13;
product est.imates for those years.   Those per-capita product levels were&#13;
projected backward into the nineteenth century on two data series from&#13;
Perkins. Trae nearer-term series includes estimates of per capita GDP in 1957&#13;
prices fc)r 1914-18, 1933, 1952, and 1957 (Perkins 1975, 122).   That series was&#13;
spliced to 'estimated 1950 per capita product (stated in 1980 dollars reflated&#13;
by the US GCP deflator) to give estimates for 1914-18 in 1980 dollars.     In an&#13;
earlier publication Perkins (1969, 27) includes an index of farm yields for&#13;
the V,eriod ..821 through 1911.  We assumed per capita product copied movements&#13;
of t hat inciex and spliced the 1901-11 index number of 78 to the estimate of&#13;
per capita product for 1914-18 now stated in 1980 dollars.    That index made&#13;
pc)ssible the estimates for 1850 and 1900 per capita product for China (with&#13;

that for East and Southeast Asia assumed to be the same as that for China).&#13;
The index was falling from the 1820s onward; however, we assumed that the&#13;
implied 1800 per capita product was the same as the implied 1821-30 per capita&#13;
product. This approach may lead to an understatement of the decline and hence&#13;
to an understatement of Chinese per capita product in 1800.&#13;
Bairoch, for example, published an estimate of $210 for Chinese GNP&#13;
per capita in 1800 stated in 1960 prices (Bairoch and Levy-Leboyer 1981,&#13;
12-14). That would be equivalent to $547 when stated in 1980 prices.&#13;
Compared to Bairoch's estimates for other world regions in 1800, it places&#13;
Chinese per capita product above the rest of Asia, including Japan, Africa,&#13;
and eastern Europe but below western Europe and North America. These&#13;
estimates do not seem credible when compared to other sources (Cf. Maddison&#13;
1983). The estimates in Table A-2 for East and Southeast Asian per capita&#13;
product before 1950 may be the best that can be done while using the&#13;
exchange-rate method of comparison.&#13;
For South Asia a recent paper by Heston brings together available&#13;
estimates of per capita product for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in&#13;
the period up to Independence. These were spliced to official estimates for&#13;
the post-1950 period cited previously to yield a full series. A useful&#13;
feature of Heston's paper is that it compares earlier efforts to estimate&#13;
Indian per capita levels of living, as measured by agricultural output, by&#13;
real wages, and by such other indicators as postal system coverage, life&#13;
expectancy and similar socioeconomic indicators which are available from the&#13;
middle of the nineteenth century onward. Heston extends past work by making a&#13;
careful evaluation of agricultural product since 1869. That analysis forms&#13;
the basis for the major component of total product and in turn makes possible&#13;
the eventual comparison which Heston makes between Indian per capita product&#13;
in 1869 and 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
The Heston analysis suggests that on the basis of exchange rates&#13;
Indian per capita income was 2.1 percent of US per capita income in 1970; in&#13;
1869, Indian per capita income was 9.1 percent of US per capita income as&#13;
measured on the basis of exchange rates.&#13;
Using data assembled by Lindert (1984), these figures may be&#13;
expressed in US dollars of 1980 to yield the following estimates of per capita&#13;
income of South Asia: For 1869, $160 and 1970, $230. Lindert's data, based&#13;
in part on Kravis, Heston and Summers (1982), is expressed in 1975 dollars&#13;
which were converted to 1980 by multiplying them by 1.65, as provided by the&#13;
GNP deflator as reported in Table A-6. The latter estimate is broadly&#13;
consistent with official sources as summarized, for example, in Morawetz&#13;
(1977) or the World Development Report, 1984. Moreover, the long-term growth&#13;
rate of per capita income from 1869 to 1970 implied by these numbers is 0.35&#13;
percent per annum, a rate which is consistent with other figures cited by&#13;
Heston.&#13;
These estimates were used to interpolate the estimate for 1900 and to&#13;
extrapolate backward to 1800 and 1850. It was assumed that per capita income&#13;
was the same in 1800, 1850, and 1869. These assumptions are not inconsistent&#13;
with the limited available information summarized by Heston.&#13;
For Western Asia data for the period since 1950 are constructed in a&#13;
manner similar to that of other regions. Estimates for the period before 1950&#13;
are adopted from Bairoch although necessary details of construction are absent&#13;
(in Bairoch and Levy-Leboyer 1981). The Bairoch estimates were adjusted to be&#13;
expressed to 1980 dollars. Three points justify the inclusion of these&#13;
relatively weak estimates in this analysis: (1) The population of Western&#13;
Asia was rielatively small- (less than five percent of the world total&#13;
throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries); (2) it was possible to&#13;
make the estimates broadly consistent with those of other world regions, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
(3) the possible errors involved should have little impact on world totals and&#13;
shares.&#13;
For Latin America, data for the period since 1950 are based on above-&#13;
cited official sources adjusted to 1980 dollars. Estimates for the period&#13;
before 1950 are based on estimates for a few of the larger countries such as&#13;
Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Cuba. Details of sources and&#13;
methods appear in McGreevey (1965). These figures were complemented by a few&#13;
more recent analyses summarized in Maddison (1983). Generally, estimates&#13;
extend only back to the mid-nineteenth century and are speculative.&#13;
For Africa official sources were used for the period since 1950&#13;
although the estimates involve considerable guesswork because so much of&#13;
economic activity is still outside the formal, measured economy. For periods&#13;
before 1950 Maddison shows some estimates for Egypt and Ghana. The estimates&#13;
adopted to construct Table A-2 are also broadly consistent with those of&#13;
Bairoch cited previously. As with the estimates for Latin America and for&#13;
South and West Asia, it is assumed that per capita income in 1800 and 1850&#13;
were the same; that is, that no growth or decline in per capita income&#13;
occurred during that period. There is virtually no quantitative evidence&#13;
which can be adduced either to confirm or deny such an assumption (Cf. Hopkins&#13;
1973). It is, however, consistent with the assumptions of most other analysts&#13;
as summarized, for example, by Reynolds (1983).&#13;
The crude techniques described above thus yield the estimates of per&#13;
capita product which appear in Table A-2. When these estimates are multiplied&#13;
by estimated regional population from Table A-1, they result in the estimates&#13;
of regional and total world gross product presented in Table A-3. These&#13;
estimates, along with those in Table A-1, thus provide the basis for the data&#13;
which appear in Figure 1.3 of the World Development Report, 1984.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Projections to the year 2000 were based on data which appear in&#13;
Chapter 3 of World Development Report, 1984 which project growth rates from&#13;
1985 to 1995 for different groups of countries. These projections were&#13;
e'xtended to the year 2000 at the same growth rates to yield the estimates of&#13;
per capita product by region. The per capita estimates were then multiplied&#13;
by estimated population to give the resultant estimates of total regional and&#13;
world product for 2000.&#13;
The purchasing-power parity or ICP method&#13;
Analysts recognize, and have attempted to adjust for the fact, that&#13;
international exchange rates used as a means of converting local production&#13;
values into any other country's currency may distort those values. The source&#13;
of the distortion is generally seen to reside with components of national&#13;
product that are not traded, particularly services such as education and&#13;
health (Marris 1984). Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1982), who managed the&#13;
International Comparison Project (ICP), demonstrated that the degree of&#13;
distortion is greater the larger is the difference in level of income between&#13;
countries being compared. The effect of ICP adjustments is always to reduce&#13;
estimated disparities in per capita product between countries when those&#13;
estimates are compared with ones based on exchange rates alone. The extent of&#13;
the disparity reduction is directly proportional to the degree of the initial&#13;
exchange-rate-weighted disparity. Thus ICP adjustments make the difference&#13;
between the United States and India appear much smaller than it appears when&#13;
exchange rates are used to value Indian, in comparison to United States,&#13;
product. The adjustments also shrink the gap between the United States and,&#13;
for example, Italy, but the amount and percentage of shrinkage in the&#13;
difference are much less than is the case with India when compared to the&#13;
United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Such adjustments would obviously be important in evaluating past&#13;
product comparisons. Maddison has written on what the implications might be&#13;
for assessing relative income levels between Europe, India, and China at the&#13;
start of Europe's industrial revolution (1983, 27-41). He shows that such&#13;
adjustments come near to supporting the contention of Bairoch in Bairoch and&#13;
Levy-Leboyer (1981, 3-17) that Third World countries enjoyed incomes on a par&#13;
with those of Western Europe in 1750, i.e., on the eve of the industrial&#13;
revolution. Most analysts (Maddison refers especially to Kuznets and Landes)&#13;
have assumed, or believed they have shown, that per capita product in Europe&#13;
was, by the mid-eighteenth century, already far above that of any other of the&#13;
world regions. Bairoch has indicated in private communications that two data&#13;
comparisons, for literacy levels and for urbanization, which he has made&#13;
recently, tend to indicate that European levels of living at the start of the&#13;
Industrial Revolution were in fact above those of other world regions. Thus&#13;
the revisions of his estimates of levels of living to be published in the&#13;
future could prove to be broadly consistent with the views of most other&#13;
economic historians who have worked on this topic.&#13;
The manner in which the ICP approach may be shown to affect relative&#13;
income levels is illustrated in Kravis (1981, 73) which shows 1975 real GDP&#13;
per capita for China and nine other countries. Per capita product for the US&#13;
was $7,176, and that calculated for other countries was as follows: India,&#13;
$474; Pakistan, $631; Thailand, $761; China, $883; Philippines, $947; Korea,&#13;
$1,177; Malaysia, $1,306; UK, $4,463, and Japan, $4,751 (calculated on the&#13;
basis of percentages of the US level given in the original). Assuming that&#13;
China maintained the same relative position in comparison to US per capita&#13;
product in 1980 as Kravis imputes to China in 1975, then Chinese per capita&#13;
product would have been, using the ICP method, $1,629.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-- 64 -&#13;
The World Bank Atlas lists Chinese per capita product in 1980 as&#13;
$270, less than a fifth of the level that the ICP method would suggest. The&#13;
adjustments called for by the ICP method are more than marginal; to make them&#13;
for some regions and not all would be quite unsatisfactory. To project them&#13;
backward into the past is warranted only because of the availability of the&#13;
special analysis carried out for India by Heston. With the purchasing-power-&#13;
parity estimates he made, for both 1869 and 1970, it is possible to link the&#13;
Indian relative level of per capita product at those two dates to other world&#13;
regions at low levels of per capita income and to adjust their levels in&#13;
proportion to the adjustment for India.&#13;
It Ls thus possible to reconstruct past per capita products for world&#13;
regions by assuming relationships between the levels of per capita product of&#13;
the United States, India, and other countries. These are presumed to be in&#13;
ratios similar to those developed by Kravis, Heston, and Summers for world&#13;
regions in chapter eight of their 1982 publication. These methods of&#13;
adjustment lead to the estimates presented in Table A-4. As with the&#13;
exchange-rate method described above, we started with estimates for recent&#13;
years, 1950 and 1980. In this case, however, we used as fully as possible the&#13;
estimates developed by Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1982, 323-346). These&#13;
estimates tend to shrink income differences between the poorest and richest&#13;
countries as discussed previously. Details of sources and methods are&#13;
presented in the footnotes to Table A-4.&#13;
Hesiton calculated the ratio of Indian per capita income to United&#13;
States income by both the ICP method and the exchange-rate method for the&#13;
benchmark years of 1869 and 1970. For 1869 his calculations revealed that&#13;
Indian income was between 20.7 percent and 29.4 percent of US 1869 per capita&#13;
income if measured on the basis of purchasing power parities (Kumar 1983,&#13;
415). The following table shows estimated Indian income levels in 1975&#13;

The figures which emerge for 1970 are consistent with data in the Kravis,&#13;
Heston and Summers (1982, 335) calculations. Their Table 8.4 shows GDP/P as&#13;
$463 in 1975 dollars, and GDY/P as $454 in the same currency thus bracketing&#13;
the figure in the table above for 1970 ICP Indian per capita income. This&#13;
finding lends confidence to this exercise despite the natural reservations&#13;
which attend the many assumptions used to produce Table A-4.&#13;
Following the same procedure as was used with Tables A-1 through A-3,&#13;
the estimates of per capita product in Table A-4 were multiplied by the&#13;
population figures in Table A-1 to yield the gross product estimates in Table&#13;
A-5. These figures are all presented in 1975 dollars whereas the figures in&#13;
Tables A-2 and A-3 are presented in 1980 dollars. The reason for this&#13;
difference was to make the figures comparable, to the degree possible, with&#13;
the Kravis, Heston, and Summers estimates. The 1975-80 inflation factor is&#13;
1.65; however, this simple conversion between the two dates may lead to&#13;
significant distortions.&#13;
All projections to the year 2000 were made with growth rates of total&#13;
product by region as projected for the period 1985-95 in World Development&#13;
Report, 1984, and extended the additional five years to the year 2000.&#13;

Implications&#13;
With existing estimates it has proved possible to prepare two sets of&#13;
point estimates over the period 1800-2000 of gross world product. The&#13;
scientific basis for many of the estimates is weak, particularly for any&#13;
periods before 1950. Nonetheless, these data may prove helpful to other&#13;
analysts in their effort to organize individual research efforts that can in&#13;
turn improve on these imperfect figures.&#13;
These data tend to support the view that the European countries were&#13;
already ahead of other world regions in level of living in 1800, near the&#13;
start of the industrial age. Even with the ICP adjustments per capita income&#13;
in the European countries was on average 25 percent higher than it was in East&#13;
and Southeast Asia, the next highest region in terms of per capita product.&#13;
The advantage of Europe+ over other regions was of course much greater than&#13;
that by 1980.&#13;
The data show a century-long secular decline of per capita product in&#13;
East and Southeast Asia from 1800 to 1900 and perhaps even extending to&#13;
1950. The decline is small when measured by exchange-rate methods, larger&#13;
when measured by ICP methods. This aggregate change for a region which&#13;
includes a third of the world's population masks steep decline in some parts&#13;
of that region accompanied by rapid growth in others. This process has been&#13;
less studied than, for example, the growth associated with overseas European&#13;
expansion over the same period, or the internal development of the United&#13;
States and other now-large economies. Because economic decline has received&#13;
relatively little attention by economic historians, this important phenomenon&#13;
needs to be the subject of future study, particularly with respect to the&#13;
long-term efifects of population expansion on this path of decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
When it proves possible to redefine income in the United Nations&#13;
System of National Accounts to include own-household production and&#13;
consumption, the relative incomes of poor and rich regions will be&#13;
substantially affected. It may perhaps be necessary to address that kind of&#13;
issue before further progress will be made in comparisons of levels of living&#13;
across space and time.&#13;
Growth accounting, 1950-82&#13;
Growth rates in low-income countries were very rapid in the 1950-1980&#13;
period when compared to any earlier periods (see Tables A-2 and A-4, panel B).&#13;
The standard sources (Morawetz 1977, World Development Report, 1984) show the&#13;
growth rates of per capita product in developing countries to be near the&#13;
rates for industrial countries and above those of the United States.&#13;
If growth rates are satisfactory, then standards of living are&#13;
improving and the gap between rich and poor may not be widening. If growth is&#13;
satisfactory, and population growth rates are also high, then population&#13;
growth per se may not be a problem. Attitudes about population growth thus&#13;
may hinge decisively on perspectives concerning the adequacy of growth. This&#13;
issue is discussed in Box 5.1 of World Development Report, 1984.&#13;
For the Europe+ countries, for which current and past growth rates&#13;
are fairly well measured, the period 1945-73 is the epoch of highest growth&#13;
ever recorded for nations as a whole, with long period growth rates double any&#13;
previously recorded. Growth rates are substantially higher than those&#13;
achieved in the early phase of modern economic growth for the northwestern&#13;
European countries, that is, from about 1870 to 1913 (Cf. Lewis 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
The high rates achieved by developing countries may be the result of&#13;
being pulled along by the exceptional growth of the developed countries.&#13;
Growth rates, the standard view. The best sources for data on&#13;
economic growth rates in the postwar period are Morawetz (1977), World&#13;
Development Report, 1984, and Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1982). In&#13;
addition, some special reports from the World Bank on sub-saharan Africa&#13;
(1981, 1984) and on China (1983) offer more detailed analytical bases for&#13;
estimates of growth rates. Table A-7 shows, for major world regions, the per&#13;
capita cumulative growth rates published in these sources for the periods&#13;
1950-77, 1950-75, and 1960-81.&#13;
These data provide the standard picture and show that growth rates in&#13;
the developing countries as a group have been satisfactory because they match&#13;
those of the industrial countries. The Kravis data cover the longest period,&#13;
1950-77, ancl show LDC growth among the middle-income countries exceeding that&#13;
of the developed countries--3.5 percent per annum versus 3.1 percent per&#13;
annum. The earlier work by Morawetz using the same data base, but with less&#13;
sophisticated derivations of comparable income deflators, found essentially&#13;
similar results in comparisons between the developed and all developing&#13;
countries. The data in World Development Report, 1984 show an array of rates&#13;
of change from declines for eight low-income economies particularly for&#13;
African countries, higher rates for the lower middle-income economies (3.2(&#13;
percent per annum), higher still for the upper-middle income economies (4.1&#13;
percent per annum), and the highest rates for the high-income oil exporters&#13;
(5.6 percent per annum). The numbers reported in World Development Report,&#13;
1984 refer to the period 1960-82, thus including the epoch of slower growth&#13;
after 1973 and excluding-the 1950s. China again appears exceptional: its&#13;
growth rate, 1960-82, is far higher than other low-income economies and even&#13;
higher than that of the developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Do these data accurately reflect improvements (or declines) in&#13;
standards of living? Corrections to these averages, suggested a decade ago by&#13;
Kuznets (1973), show that these overages tend to overstate improvements among&#13;
poor countries and understate them among industrial countries.     In addition,&#13;
corrections for sub-Saharan Africa and China need to be made on the basis of&#13;
more accurate economic reporting recently available. For sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
per capita product declined by 3 to 4 percent in each of the years 1981, 1982,&#13;
and 1983 and is probably declining similarly in 1984 (World Bank report on&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa 1984, 14). That decline wipes out the modest gains&#13;
achieved in the 1970s. The growth rate for 1960 to the end of 1983 was about&#13;
one percent per annum for the 23 year period. The World Development Report,&#13;
1984 for China is too high: The World Bank's recent report on China (1983)&#13;
puts the growth rate at 2.7 or 3.5 percent per annum, 1957-79, depending on&#13;
use of domestic or international price levels. The lower rate is probably&#13;
more correct. Such a difference pulls down the overall growth rate for&#13;
low-income economies by a large margin because of the weight of the Chinese in&#13;
the aggregate.&#13;
Correcting growth rates. The growth rates registered in Table A-7&#13;
probably overstate the real growth in available product and consumption,&#13;
particularly in the low-income countries. Besides the corrections already&#13;
suggested above, Kuznets's review (1973) sets out some additional reasons.&#13;
Averaged rates of growth for groups of countries are a poor indicator of real&#13;
welfare changes when the presumed benefits of growth are not equally shared&#13;
across all countries and socioeconomic groups which are averaged together.&#13;
Further, there has been a significant tendency for population to move from&#13;
subsistence agriculture to monetized urban work so that what appears to be&#13;
growth is merely the inclusion in national accounts of productive work that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
was formerly not measured. Finally, because of the substantial differences in&#13;
the cost of living between urban and rural areas, the rising component of&#13;
urban act.vities in the total does not represent additions to real welfare but&#13;
merely a higher price paid for a given level of welfare. The quantitative&#13;
implications of these effects are described by Kuznets and in summary form in&#13;
note 2 be]ow.&#13;
B3ased on the suggested adjustments from Kuznets, and the fresh data&#13;
available on African and Chinese growth from recent World Bank analyses, one&#13;
can compare in Table A-8 the illustrative growth rates of per capita product&#13;
as given in standard sources and those which, after adjustment, represent a&#13;
fair appraisal of rates of improvement in real welfare.&#13;
The adjusted data show a growth rate for the industrial countries&#13;
more than double that of Latin America, four times that of non-Chinese Asia,&#13;
eight times that of sub-Saharan Africa, and well above even that of China.&#13;
The downward adjustment of growth rates is the greater, the lower is the&#13;
region's Level of development. Thus South Asia, one of the poorest regions,&#13;
has its growth rate cut to 1 percent per annum; that of sub-Saharan Africa is&#13;
cut by nearly 80 percent but to a level even below that of South Asia. The&#13;
growth ratce for Latin America is cut the least although the reduction is above&#13;
one-third, to a level far below that usually associated with that region.&#13;
Even with the adjustments, growth is still positive for all regions. It is,&#13;
however, slow, slow enough for the low and middle-income countries to have&#13;
been falling further behind the developed countries for the past quarter&#13;
century.&#13;
The Kuznets analysis and data refer to the early postwar period of&#13;
the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s. For China and India growth rates in the 1970s&#13;
were somewhat above the experience of the 1960s. For other low-income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
countries, especially for sub-Saharan Africa, growth was slower in the 1970s&#13;
(3.6 percent per annum for total GDP) than it had been in the 1960s (4.7&#13;
percent per annum). The adjustments which Kuznets suggested for the earlier&#13;
period would be as necessary for the 1970s as they had been for the earlier&#13;
period. Services continued to grow faster than other sectors. Urbanization&#13;
continued unabated except that the upper-middle income countries had a&#13;
slightly slower rate of growth of urban population in the 1970s than in the&#13;
1960s (3.8 vs. 4.2 percent per annum).&#13;
Overall, the data in Table A-8 suggest reducing recorded growth rates&#13;
of per capita product by three-fifths for East and South Asia, by one-third&#13;
for Latin America, by four-fifths for sub-Saharan Africa, and by one-half for&#13;
China. The adjustments made for Africa and China do not provide for constant&#13;
population weights or for intersectoral shifts to the service sector and urban&#13;
living costs, both of which would cut estimated growth rates still further.&#13;
Implications of adjusted growth rates. Some recent writings may&#13;
offer too rosy a view of development accomplishments in the postwar period.&#13;
Table 4 in the text shows little change in income disparities between Europe+&#13;
and other regions between 1950 and 1980. With adjustments proposed here, the&#13;
picture would appear quite different. Berry and Bourguignon conclude that&#13;
when income distribution is measured by changes in per capita CDP that there&#13;
has been no unqualified increase in inequality. Yet because of the greater&#13;
inequality of consumption in the years since 1960, "The 1977 distribution [of&#13;
per capita consumption] is unambiguously more unequal than that of 1950. The&#13;
main source of this difference with the GNP distribution trend lies in&#13;
differences across countries in the behaviour of the consumption to GNP ratio"&#13;
(Berry and Bourguignon 1983, 339). By their consumption measure the absolute&#13;
number of poor people rose from 1.3 billion to 1.7 billion, 1950 to 1977.     But&#13;

on the measure of GNP per capita, the number of poor declined over the same&#13;
period (from 1.2 to 1.0 billion). The consumption share decline is itself a&#13;
matter of concern since it signals a concentration of income in the hands of&#13;
upper-income households.&#13;
Morawetz correctly observes the wide disparities in rates of growth&#13;
during the 1950-75 period and remarks on the contrast with all previous&#13;
periods. Growth even of 1.6 percent per annum in per capita product or&#13;
consumption equals the average long-term performance of 14 developed countries&#13;
in the period since modern economic growth began (Kuznets 1966, 64,65).     Every&#13;
world region in the Morawetz calculations exceeded that average rate. That&#13;
observation led him to conclude that despite evidence of stagnation in some&#13;
regions (Africa and South Asia), the development process was well under way.&#13;
With the Kuznets corrections suggested above, the growth rate for all&#13;
regions except China and Latin America falls below the long-term averages for&#13;
the developed countries -- as weLl as far below the accomplishments of the&#13;
developed countries in the exceptional growth period since 1950.&#13;
Conclusions. This note reexamined growth rates of per capita product&#13;
in the postwar period. The following conclusions emerge:&#13;
o    Growth rates for developing countries in the period 1950-83 have been&#13;
overstated by one-third or more for all regions, the overstatement being&#13;
greatest for the poorest regions;&#13;
o    The gap between rich and poor certainly widened from 1800 to 1950 and&#13;
may have continued to widen between 1950 and 1980.&#13;
The standard data show that development has proceeded slowly but&#13;
satisfactorily for the poor countries in the past quarter century; these data&#13;
are conceptually flawed. They are based on overestimation of the contribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
of nonagricultural sectors protected by government policy, as well as a&#13;
distorted method of adding up growth experiences of components of the&#13;
population. The rapidity with which the gains in income in Africa have been&#13;
reversed in recent years reflects the fragility of development achievements of&#13;
the 1960s and 1970s. The hope that growth in the low-income countries will&#13;
follow automatically a reacceleration in growth in the industrial countries&#13;
may be illusory.&#13;
This reexamination of growth rates awakens renewed concern about the&#13;
implications of rapid population growth. There may be, for the poorest&#13;
countries, no automatic response of fertility decline to structural change&#13;
associated with income gains because income has not, and may not in the&#13;
future, rise to induce such change. More effective population policies may&#13;
thus be essential to escape a vicious circle of economic stagnation and&#13;
population increase.&#13;

Notes&#13;
Note 1. The comparison of 1950 and 1980 products in one currency still leaves&#13;
two methods for dealing with products produced in the other country and&#13;
normally sold or exchanged in an alternative currency. One method is to&#13;
convert the European GDP of 1950 into 1950 dollars then to convert those 1950&#13;
dollars into 1980 dollars by use of the US reflator described above. (The&#13;
values for such a reflator are provided in Table A-6. An alternative method&#13;
is to convert the 1950 products in their own currencies (francs, pounds or&#13;
marcs) by means of a reflator for each of those currencies so that their 1950&#13;
values are stated in 1980 francs, pounds, or marcs. These several values are&#13;
then converted to 1980 dollars by prevailing exchange rates. Obviously, the&#13;
two conversion methods could yield quite different results, depending on the&#13;
movement of prices and productivity within countries. If products are traded&#13;
internationally, the differences would not be so great. But for home&#13;
production and for services, these two methods could yield substantial&#13;
differences. Some of these issues are discussed in Kravis, Heston and Summers&#13;
(1982, 323-346).&#13;
One source of difficulty may be illustrated by comparing two ways of&#13;
reducing European and US product for two dates, 1950 and 1980, to a common&#13;
standard, US$ of 1980 purchasing power. Both methods require a reflator that&#13;
turns 1950 dollars into 1980 dollars. That requires that products stated in&#13;
1950 dollars be multiplied by that factor which would exactly allow one to buy&#13;
the same products in 1980 in 1980 dollars. Microcomputers, of course, did not&#13;
even exist in 1950, and the price of such items as television sets, electric&#13;
generators and men's suits have moved in such divergent ways as to confound&#13;
the careful analyst. Most such analyses remain essentially illustrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
rather than definitive statements about true and measurable differences in&#13;
levels of living. The persistent deficiency of such estimates as measures of&#13;
real welfare, or of changes in real welfare, is illustrated well in a paper by&#13;
Kuznets (1979) on problems in comparing regional trends in growth from the&#13;
1950s through the 1970s.&#13;
Note 2. Kuznets starts by observing the per capita product growth rates for&#13;
industrial countries and developing countries from the mid 1950s to mid&#13;
1960s. He then reweights these growth rates by applying constant population&#13;
weights to all countries. This correction give less weight to relatively&#13;
richer countries with faster growing populations which are given improperly&#13;
large weights in the current mode of aggregation between countries. The&#13;
results of this exercise appear in the comparisons in the following table:&#13;
Reweighted for&#13;
Area                 Standard     Constant Population&#13;
Industrial countries           3.4 %            4.07&#13;
Developing countries*          2.2              1.80&#13;
* Includes only countries of E and SE Asia and Latin America;&#13;
excludes Africa and Middle East because of poor data and China&#13;
for lack of data.&#13;
The reweighted data (Kuznets 1973, Table 5, 326) include constant population&#13;
weights that give proper emphasis to countries experiencing fast growth from&#13;
low income levels (particularly Japan in the industrial countries). This&#13;
approach tends to lower aggregated growth rates for developing countries&#13;
because the standard approach overemphasizes the growth of Latin America which&#13;
grew faster in total product, population and per capita product than did South&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
and Southeast Asia. Since income gains in Latin America do not become&#13;
available to people in Asia, the constant-population aggregation technique is&#13;
a fairer reflection of real welfare implications of observed income change.&#13;
Kuznets then undertakes a second adjustment of the data to take account of&#13;
the bias of growth caused by overstatement of the value of output of service&#13;
sectors. These calculations depend critically on the assumption that a share&#13;
of total product in services beyond about 40 percent is probably not yielding&#13;
a value of- real output and welfare equivalent to that included in the national&#13;
accounts data. The service sector is presumably absorbing excess labor. The&#13;
adjustments are described in detail in Kuznets (1973). The impact on per&#13;
capita growth rates is summarized in the following table for the period of the&#13;
mid-1950s to the mid-1960s:&#13;
Unadjusted    Sector Adjusted*&#13;
East and South East Asia        1.9 - 2.0           1.04&#13;
Latin America                   1.8 - 2.4           1.61&#13;
* As adjusted in Kuznets (1973, Table 8, line 7); excludes China.&#13;
Kuznets shows by example (no good data were available) that if growth&#13;
was concentrated in upper-income groups during this period, the adjusted&#13;
growth of average per capita product could be as little as one-quarter of the&#13;
recorded per capita growth rate. Such would be the result of a 2 percent per&#13;
annum growth of total product in which all income growth is concentrated among&#13;
the upper 10 percent of income earners who together get 40 percent of total&#13;
income. This pattern of distribution is less extreme than that which prevails&#13;
in Brazil, Panama, and Mexico (see World Development Report, 1984, 273). His&#13;
approach, as this example illustrates, is more reflective of real welfare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
changes associated with income growth than is a simple aggregation of income&#13;
earners regardless of initial income class.&#13;
During the 1950s and 1960s output of services grew faster than other&#13;
sectors even though the service sector was already large by comparison to the&#13;
size of the service sector in the European countries (Kuznets 1973, 337,&#13;
footnote 7). A special adjustment for Latin America, reflected in the sector&#13;
adjustment column in the table above, takes account of the shift of population&#13;
from low-cost rural areas to high-cost urban ones. The urban share in&#13;
population rose, 1950-60, from 25 to 33 percent of total population. Failure&#13;
to adjust for the different costs of living of the altered proportion of the&#13;
urban in total population overstates improvements in real welfare.&#13;

            Economic aspects of historical demographic change
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper explores several related
            propositions about rural economic life and demographic
            change. A central thesis is that the shrinking of the farm
            labor force associated with past processes of economic
            development led to lower fertility. A subsidiary thesis is
            that this effect may no longer be essential to cause
            fertility decline; government population policies can
            substitute for it. This paper emphasizes two features of the
            transition in now-industrial countries: (1) the rising costs
            and falling benefits to parents of having many children, and
            (2) the link of that change to productivity growth in and
            structural change away from farming. Labor-saving
            innovations on farms lessened the benefits of children,
            causing the main fertility transition. Women left unpaid
            family labor on farms to work in offices, factories, and
            shops; this shift depressed fertility as jobs interfered
            with child care. Jobs for children were fewer in urban than
            rural settings, so more children attended school, and most
            parents decided to have fewer but better-educated children.
            The annex describes world and regional estimates of gross
            and per capita product for selected dates from 1800 to 1980
            and projections the the year 2000.
