ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper examines the structure and evolution of the Indian&#13;
financial system over the past three decades. The study concentrates on&#13;
the "organized" segment of the system which includes commercial, develop-&#13;
ment and cooperative banks, the stock market, and various non-banking&#13;
financial institutions including insurance corporations and mutual funds.&#13;
The paper also highlights several policy issues in the sector in an&#13;
attempt to spearhead discussions and further analytical work.&#13;
The paper first describes the institutional structure of the&#13;
financial system and then analyzes its evolution and financial interrela-&#13;
tions using a flow of funds framework and other relevant tools of finan-&#13;
cial planning. The paper then identifies and analyzes some issues related&#13;
to credit planning, including credit allocation policies and selected&#13;
instruments of monetary and credit policy such as interest rates. The&#13;
analysis of these policies is particularly relevant since credit planning&#13;
is a important element in India's financial system. The paper provides a&#13;
broad description and analysis of these policies and indicates areas in&#13;
which further work may be necessary.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.      The purpose of this study is to provide a descriptive and analytical&#13;
view of the structure of the Indian financial system with a macroeconomic&#13;
perspective. The study also highlights the major policy issues in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.      The study first describes the institutional structure of the&#13;
financial system and then analyzes its evolution and financial&#13;
interrelations using a flow of funds framework and other relevant tools of&#13;
financial planning. This allows the examination of three aspects of the&#13;
process by which saving is channelled to investors through the financial&#13;
system: first the amount of savings and investment that go on in the&#13;
economy, then the question of who saves and who invests, and finally, the&#13;
flow of funds through financial institutions and markets as money passes on&#13;
its way from savers to investors.&#13;
3.      The study then identifies and analyzes issues related to credit&#13;
planning, including credit allocation policies and selected instruments of&#13;
monetary and credit policy. The analysis of these policies is particularly&#13;
relevant since credit planning is an important element in India's Financial&#13;
System.  The purpose of credit planning is twofold:   first, to ensure a&#13;
planned credit expansion for the economy as a whole, and second to make sure&#13;
that credit flows to desired regions and sectors for increasing production,&#13;
fulfilling output targets and meeting other national social and economic&#13;
objectives. Official Government policy with regards to banking is that its&#13;
operations should be related to development priorities indicated in the&#13;
national plans as well as to returns on capital. In view of this, the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India, which coordinates credit planning in the country,&#13;
makes an extensive use of interest rate and credit allocation policies to&#13;
provide credit at preferential rates for priority activities, sectors and&#13;
regions. The study provides a broad description and analysis of these&#13;
policies and indicates areas in which further work may be necessary. The&#13;
following tools of credit planning are analyzed: credit authorization&#13;
scheme, Tandon Committee's inventory and working capital norms, Chore&#13;
Committee's Report on the Cash Credit System, reserve requirements,&#13;
differential interest rate scheme and overall interest rate and credit&#13;
allocation policies.&#13;
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Institutional Structure of the Financial System&#13;
4.      Financial intermediation in India is conducted by a wide range and&#13;
large number of financial institutions. The Reserve Bank of India is the&#13;
apex institution of the financial system and the commercial banks have a&#13;
predominant role since they hold 40% of financial assets. Other important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial institutions are the development finance institutions at the&#13;
all-India, regional and State level; the insurance corporations; mutual fund&#13;
institutions such as the Unit Trust of India; and the Post Office Savings&#13;
Bank.&#13;
5.      The structure and evolution of the Indian financial system since&#13;
the late 1960s have been closely related to an increasing degree of public&#13;
ownership and control of financial institutions. Practically all the&#13;
important financial institutions are now under public control, and about 85%&#13;
of total financial assets flow through public sector financial institutions.&#13;
In addition, the Government regulates and controls capital issues and the&#13;
functioning of the stock market. This extensive control of the financial&#13;
system is aimed at ensuring the flow of finance in desired directions and in&#13;
particular to priority areas of development such as agriculture, small&#13;
industries and backward areas; and at assisting in the accomplishment of&#13;
Plan goals.&#13;
Weaknesses of Financial Institutions&#13;
6.      The review of the institutional structure of the Indian financial&#13;
system identified the following major weaknesses: (a) proliferation of&#13;
financial institutions, (b) low direct mobilization of savings by&#13;
development finance institutions; (c) low profitability of the commercial&#13;
banking system, and (d) high level of overdues particularly in agricultural&#13;
finance institutions.&#13;
7.      A major weakness of the financial system which should be addressed&#13;
is the proliferation of financial institutions, some of which overlap in&#13;
their functions and objectives. This proliferation occurs both in&#13;
industrial finance and agricultural finance. There is a need to review the&#13;
role of these institutions, particularly those which are not functioning&#13;
satisfactorily. A review of functions and objectives may suggest some&#13;
restructurings and/or mergers which could strengthen the remaining&#13;
institutions. A careful assessment of financial viability before&#13;
establishing new institutions or branches of existing institutions would&#13;
also strengthen the system.&#13;
8.      Another area which needs closer attention is the scope for larger&#13;
direct mobilization of savings by development institutions. Most of these&#13;
institutions do not mobilize any deposits directly from the public, and the&#13;
bonds and debentures floated by them are only taken up by banks and other&#13;
financial institutions because of reserve requirements. Consequently, they&#13;
depend very heavily on the Government, the RBI and the banks for their&#13;
funds. This sluggish direct resource mobilization is due to the combined&#13;
effect of regulations and lack of appropriate returns to investors.&#13;
9.      The low profitability of the commercial banking system is another&#13;
major concern. Low profitability results from a combination of factors:&#13;
(a) loan overdues; (b) overstaffing and low efficiency due to outdated&#13;
procedures and banking technology; (c) high degree of risk absorption and&#13;
administration costs associated with priority sector lending; and (d) very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
low capitalization ratios 1/ (1% as compared to 5%-6% for US banks). Due to&#13;
the predominance of banking in the Indian financial system, efforts should&#13;
be directed at improving its financial health.&#13;
10.     High overdues are a problem which affect many Indian financial&#13;
institutions. It is a widespread problem in agricultural finance but also&#13;
occurs in industrial credit. Overdues accounted for 44% of total loans&#13;
outstanding of Primary Agriculture Credit Societies in June 1981 and for 22%&#13;
of credit outstanding to regional banks as of December 1982. In the case of&#13;
industrial finance institutions, overdues accounted for 19% of SFCs'&#13;
outstanding assistance and are also high in SIDCs'. These levels are very&#13;
high by western standards and seriously affect the ability of some of the&#13;
institutions to sustain their lending operations. Fund shortages have to be&#13;
met by direct assistance and borrowing from State and Central Governments.&#13;
During the past two years, several SFCs have been implementing various&#13;
measures to improve the recovery position, with encouraging results since&#13;
overdues fell from 27% in March 1981 to 19% in March 1983. Similar efforts&#13;
should be undertaken by other institutions, particularly agricultural credit&#13;
cooperatives and Regional Rural Banks.&#13;
Evolution of the Financial System&#13;
11.     Data on the evolution of the financial system since 1950 document&#13;
the increased "financialization" of the Indian economy and indicate that an&#13;
increased role of the public sector on the financial system has not retarded&#13;
its development. This is shown by the ratio of assets of financial&#13;
institutions to GDP which has increased gradually from 38% in 1950 to 73% in&#13;
1975, then quickly to 103% by 1980. Behind this extensive financial&#13;
deepening has been the increase in the assets of the commercial banks.&#13;
Other key factors in the growth of the financial system are the emergence of&#13;
new financial intermediaries such as development banks and the Unit Trust of&#13;
India, and the expansion of the cooperative movement and of provident funds.&#13;
12.     Although the growing public sector involvement has not retarded the&#13;
development of the financial system it may have reduced its efficiency by:&#13;
(a) reducing the flexibility of the institutions, particularly of commercial&#13;
banks, to undertake discretionary lending, (b) increasing administrative&#13;
requirements for processing requests for financial assistance, (c) reducing&#13;
the scope of the system to allocate resources based on economic and&#13;
financial considerations rather than on political or social grounds, and&#13;
(d) reducing the operational autonomy of top management in the larger&#13;
institutions. Future rapid growth of the system at rates comparable to&#13;
those achieved in the recent past concurrent with needed improvements in the&#13;
finances of the institutions is likely to require a relaxation of Government&#13;
control over certain aspects of the functioning of the system such as the&#13;
ability of the institutions to engage in discretionary lending and to&#13;
determine interest rates.&#13;
1/ Proportion of total bank assets to total credit allocation. It&#13;
approximates the inverse of the gearing ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Development and Flow of Funds&#13;
13.     The analysis of the various measures of financial development also&#13;
shows an increase in the importance of financial institutions in the economy&#13;
and of financial flows relative to economic activity. This indicates that&#13;
the financial system is playing an increasingly active role in the transfer&#13;
of funds from the surplus to the deficit sectors in the economy. The main&#13;
surplus sectors are Households and Rest of the World (ROW), while the major&#13;
deficit sectors are the Government and Private Corporate Business. The&#13;
financial deficit of the Government increased from 1.8% of GDP in 1951-56&#13;
to 4.4% in 1961-66 and 6.7% in 1977-81. Similarly, the deficit of the&#13;
Private Corporate Sector also increased from 0.8% of GDP in 1951-56 to 1.6%&#13;
in 1961-66 and 1.7% in 1977-81. These two deficit sectors complement their&#13;
funding requirements by direct borrowing from Households and ROW, and&#13;
indirectly through financial intermediation. The Household sector, which&#13;
recorded very high financial surpluses in the 1970s, was the major financier&#13;
and lent to the deficit sectors and the financial system in the form of&#13;
currency and deposits, contractual savings, small savings and trade debt.&#13;
Savings and The Financial System&#13;
14.     Particularly since the mid-seventies, India has experienced very&#13;
high savings rates relative to its low per capita income. The acceleration&#13;
and maintenance of the saving rate at relatively high levels, has been&#13;
closely linked with income growth--the elasticity of gross domestic savings&#13;
with respect to real income exceeds 2.0. The increase in the proportion of&#13;
net disposable income to net domestic product partly explains the rising&#13;
saving rate, but other factors have contributed as well: (a) the&#13;
significant financial deepening of the Indian economy since independence,&#13;
(b) the increasing share of the secondary and tertiary sectors in the NDP&#13;
which have higher marginal propensities to save; and in the 1970s, (c) the&#13;
strong growth in production (especially in agriculture), and (d) the&#13;
improved saving performance of the public sector.&#13;
15.     Higher saving rates in the Indian economy since the mid-seventies&#13;
have been accompanied by higher levels of financial savings. Household&#13;
savings in the form of (a) financial assets and (b) physical assets have&#13;
increased, with financial savings now accounting for a significant 7.2% of&#13;
NDP, compared to 0.7% in 1950/51. Among various financial instruments, net&#13;
deposits have shown the largest increase as a percentage of financial&#13;
savings of the household sector (see Table 2.8). The bulk of the increase&#13;
in deposits, and in financial savings, during the 1970s was directed to&#13;
commercial banks which increased their role in the financial system.&#13;
Private Capital Market&#13;
16.     The data on financial savings also underscore the declining&#13;
importance of shares and debentures to total financial assets of the&#13;
household sector during the 1970s. The small growth in capital market&#13;
instruments resulted from the combination of demand and supply factors. On&#13;
the demand side, investors were not encouraged by the market yields which&#13;
discounted for risk were less favorable than returns on other financial&#13;
instruments. On the supply side, companies were reluctant to approach the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
capital markets due to high costs, and cumbersome procedures and&#13;
regulations. Resource mobilization through the capital market has improved&#13;
substantially in the early 1980s in response to measures which have enhanced&#13;
industrial competitiveness and performance, liberalized debt-equity norms&#13;
and increased interest rate ceilings for debentures which have made them&#13;
more interesting to investors. Private corporate capital issues grew from&#13;
Rs 1.1 billion in 1978/79 to Rs 7.4 billion in 1982/83. Nevertheless, the&#13;
capital market still accounts for a small proportion of total financial&#13;
assets. Further work on capital markets is required to provide an insight&#13;
into likely constraints to future growth and to recommend policy changes to&#13;
improve their functioning in order to meet the financial requirements of&#13;
industry more effectively.&#13;
Credit Allocation&#13;
17.     The Government intervenes extensively in the credit allocation&#13;
process both by directing commercial banks to lend to priority sectors and&#13;
by establishing specialized institutions such as development banks to make&#13;
priority loans. While the intervention has succeeded in diverting credit&#13;
into desired channels, its impact in terms of economic growth and efficiency&#13;
in the use of resources is not very clear. Further work in this area is&#13;
required. Although there may be a role for policies which encourage credit&#13;
allocation to previously neglected economic activities, this should not be&#13;
done at the expense of other equally or more productive activities. A&#13;
balance has to be maintained between the different sectors, particularly&#13;
during times of tight credit. Another important change in credit allocation&#13;
by commercial banks since nationalization has been the increase in the share&#13;
of credit to the public sector in relation to total credit. Credit&#13;
outstanding to the public sector increased from 13.4% in December 1972 to&#13;
29.5% in June 1977. This highlights the increasing role of the banking&#13;
system in financing public sector expenditures during the 1970s. Since 1979&#13;
there has been a reversal of this trend and in June 1981 the share of the&#13;
credit outstanding to the public sector stood at 24%. This development is&#13;
welcome because it releases bank funds for financing private sector&#13;
investment and consumption.&#13;
Reserve Requirements&#13;
18.     The public sector uses a large proportion of banking system&#13;
resources because, in addition to lending, the banks also invest about 36%&#13;
of total deposits in Government and Government approved securities. This&#13;
investment is in line with reserve requirement regulations which require&#13;
banks to hold 36% of their liabilities in India in Government and&#13;
Government-approved securities. This reserve requirement, also known as the&#13;
statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), which stood at 25% of bank liabilities when&#13;
introduced in 1962 has been raised several times to its present level of 36%&#13;
and has now become the major channel for directing bank resources to the&#13;
Government.  Scheduled banks are also required to hold 8.5% of bank deposits&#13;
as balance with the Reserve Bank under cash reserve ratio (CRR)&#13;
requirements. These high levels of reserve requirements coupled with&#13;
priority sector lending targets significantly reduce the flexibility of the&#13;
banking system to engage in discretionary lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Credit Authorization Scheme&#13;
19.     Related to credit deployment is the Credit Authorization Scheme&#13;
(CAS) introduced by the RBI in 1965 as an additional measure of credit&#13;
regulation. The CAS went through major modifications in 1975, 1979, and&#13;
1983 following recommendations of various Committees. The main objectives&#13;
of the scheme are to enforce financial discipline on the larger borrowers&#13;
and ensure that they do not preempt scarce bank resources. Under this&#13;
scheme, commercial and cooperative banks are required to obtain&#13;
authorization from the RBI prior to extending credit beyond certain limits&#13;
to large borrowers.l/ The CAS mostly affects working capital requirements&#13;
although it also affects term lending. In 1975 and 1979, the CAS was&#13;
modified following the recommendations of the Tandon (1974) and Chore (1979)&#13;
Committees. The most important recommendations set limits on borrowers for&#13;
holding inventories and receivables which restrict their ability to borrow&#13;
from the banking system. These limits, and the CAS in general, have been&#13;
criticized on various grounds: (a) they do not give the banks the&#13;
flexibility required to operate in a constantly changing economic&#13;
environment; (b) they are too restrictive since they try to enforce two&#13;
types of control: limit inventory holding by firms and restrict the&#13;
proportion of bank finance in total hence working capital; and (c) they&#13;
classify industry into only 15 groups, hence they do not make allowance for&#13;
relevant individual characteristics, including variances in financial&#13;
strength, market circumstances, management strengths; and the different&#13;
subsector characteristics.&#13;
20.     In 1983 the CAS was reviewed by the Marathe Committee which made&#13;
various recommendations to streamline the authorization process. The&#13;
Committee recommended that banks should be allowed greater discretion to&#13;
deploy credit under CAS, in certain specific conditions, even without RBI's&#13;
prior clearance. The larger discretionary powers are meant to speed up the&#13;
release of funds to borrowers. The RBI has endorsed the recommendations of&#13;
the Committee and is moving toward their implementation. A more meaningful&#13;
liberalization of CAS may not be feasible unless the cash credit system&#13;
widely used in India is substantially modified (for details refer to&#13;
paragraph 4.18). A major reason for the establishment of CAS, and for the&#13;
tightening in its implementation in 1974 and 1979 was to enhance credit&#13;
control and planning by the RBI on a cash credit system in which this kind&#13;
of control would otherwise be very difficult. Nonetheless, the fact that&#13;
it has been subject to so many revisions in recent years clearly indicate&#13;
that there is some dissatisfaction with the effects of CAS on the ability of&#13;
Banks to provide timely credit and to be held fully responsible for the&#13;
allocation of credit. Perhaps other general instruments of credit planning&#13;
1/ The scheme has been modified several times in the past to account for&#13;
changing economic environment. For more details refer to the section on&#13;
the CAS (paragraphs 4.8 to 4.21). As of June 30, 1983, credit limits&#13;
under the CAS stood at Rs 170.5 billion and affected 897 parties of&#13;
which 188 were of the public sector and accounted for 60.9% of the total&#13;
credit limits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
could be modified to replace CAS and achieve its objectives without the&#13;
associated costs.&#13;
Interest Rate Policy&#13;
21.     The level and structure of interest rates in India are fixed by the&#13;
Government through the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank. The&#13;
interest rate policy focuses on the following sometimes conflicting&#13;
objectives: (a) mobilization of financial savings by offering attractive&#13;
returns; (b) support of activity on particular sectors through lending at&#13;
preferential interest rates; (c) financing the Government's considerable&#13;
borrowing requirements as cheaply as possible; and (d) providing a general&#13;
framework for macroeconomic stability. As a result, the structure of&#13;
interest rates is too complex and could be simplified in order to raise the&#13;
efficiency of financial intermediation. Some aspects of interest rate&#13;
policy such as preferential lending rates for particular sectors and&#13;
preferential borrowing rates to the Government have the potential for&#13;
misallocating resources. In the past changes in interest rates have been&#13;
made on a piecemeal basis and in many cases have caused undesired&#13;
distortions by providing too high or too low returns to certain types of&#13;
financial assets. The fact that in addition to a complex interest rate&#13;
policy, India also has a very detailed credit allocation policy also&#13;
indicates that there is scope to simplify the interest rate structure&#13;
without significantly altering the direction of credit. The simplification&#13;
of the interest rate structure would bring about several benefits to the&#13;
financial system, including lower administrative costs, improved allocation&#13;
of resources, and possibly an overall reduction in interest rates.&#13;
22.     Temporary upsurges in inflation have caused real interest rates to&#13;
turn negative sporadically, particularly for deposits, but negative real&#13;
interest rates have not been a significant cause for concern because the&#13;
phenomenon is temporary and also because the rates turned only slightly&#13;
negative (excluding 1973-75). The Government has chosen to tackle the&#13;
problem of negative real interest rates by controlling upsurges in inflation&#13;
rather than by increasing nominal rates. Therefore, adjustments in the&#13;
overall level of interest rates have been fairly infrequent over recent&#13;
years, though there have been a number of changes in interest rates for&#13;
particular categories of lending. The current policy is sensible since&#13;
India's inflation is known to fluctuate sharply because it is very sensitive&#13;
to agricultural performance which in turn is sensitive to fluctuations in&#13;
rainfall.&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE INDIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM&#13;
1.1     The Indian financial system is characterized by its two major&#13;
segments: an "organized" sector, which includes commercial, development and&#13;
cooperative banks, the stock market, and various non-banking financial&#13;
institutions including insurance corporations and mutual funds; and a&#13;
"traditional" sector also known as the informal credit market which provides&#13;
financing mainly for small enterprises, farms and consumption. The two&#13;
markets are segregated according to categories of customers, rates of&#13;
interest and credit conditions, miscellaneous business practices, and to a&#13;
certain extent, different geographical areas. Systematic information on the&#13;
size of the informal credit market is not available. For instance, accord-&#13;
ing to Timberg,l/ the informal credit market accounts for up to 30% of all&#13;
capital in Indian urban markets while Goldsmith 2/ attributes a much smaller&#13;
share to its financial operations.   This paper will focus only on the&#13;
organized financial system.&#13;
1.2     Financial intermediation in India's "organized" sector is conducted&#13;
by a wide range and large number of financial institutions which operate&#13;
largely in the major cities.   Since the 1960s, however, there has been a&#13;
drive toward decentralization which has been quite successful at mobilizing&#13;
savings, particularly by commercial and cooperative banks in smaller popula-&#13;
tion centers. The Reserve Bank of India as the main regulator of credit is&#13;
the apex institution in the financial system. Other important financial&#13;
institutions are the commercial banks which hold about 40% of the total&#13;
assets of the financial system. Outside of the commercial banks, the finan-&#13;
cial system includes institutions which predominantly mobilize resources,&#13;
such as the Cooperative Banks, the Life Insurance Corporation, the General&#13;
Insurance Corporation, and the Unit Trust of India and institutions which&#13;
predominantly provide financing such as industrial, agricultural and housing&#13;
development bodies at the all-India regional, and State levels. Other&#13;
important institutions for resource mobilization are the Post Office Savings&#13;
Bank and Provident Funds which use almost all of their funds to finance&#13;
government activities. In addition, there are several investment, hire-&#13;
purchase and leasing companies which have played only a very limited role in&#13;
the system due to the small development of the capital markets in India.&#13;
Chart 1 shows the structure of the organized financial system in India. The&#13;
following is a description of the major institutions in the system.&#13;

A. RESERVE BANK OF INDIA (RBI)&#13;
1.3     The RBI is the central bank of the Indian financial system.    It was&#13;
established in 1935 and from 1949 became a Government-owned institution&#13;
under the Reserve Bank Act of 1948, which empowers the Central Government to&#13;
issue directions to the Bank, after consultation with the Governor of the&#13;
Bank. The RBI formulates and implements monetary and credit policy, func-&#13;
tions as banker's bank and Central bank; manages the liquidity reserves of&#13;
the credit institutions and supervises their operations. It also plays an&#13;
important role in the maintenance of the exchange value of the rupee,&#13;
exercises control over payments and receipts for international trade&#13;
transactions, and regulates other transactions in foreign exchange. In&#13;
addition to these traditional functions of a Central Bank, it undertakes&#13;
several special functions aimed at developing the financial system such as:&#13;
integrating the informal credit market into the organized financial sectors,&#13;
encouraging innovation in cooperative banks and extension of the commercial&#13;
banking system in the rural areas, and influencing the allocation of long-&#13;
term investment credit. It also has a creative role in developing the&#13;
system. For instance, it started the Agricultural and Rural Development&#13;
Corporation (ARDC), the Unit Trust (UTI), the Industrial Development Bank of&#13;
India (IDBI), and developed the Agricultural Cooperative Credit System.&#13;
B. COMMERCIAL BANKING&#13;
1.4     Next to the RBI, commercial banks are the most important institu-&#13;
tions in the system. Commercial banking has changed substantially over the&#13;
past 30 years due to increasing nationalization and tighter government&#13;
control over bank operations. In 1955 the Imperial Bank, the largest bank&#13;
in India, was nationalized and merged with the government-owned banks of&#13;
some of the princely States to become the State Bank of India (SBI). Other&#13;
important changes which occurred in the mid-sixties were the implementation&#13;
of the Credit Authorization Scheme which subjected banks to obtain RBI&#13;
approval on extension of new credit in excess of Rs 1 million to large&#13;
companies, and the enactment of the Scheme of Social Control in 1968 which&#13;
set up guidelines for banks to allocate credit to priority sectors. In July&#13;
1969, the 14 largest privately-owned commercial banks were nationalized,&#13;
bringing under direct government control about 80% of the commercial bank&#13;
assets. In April 1980, six additional commercial banks were nationalized.&#13;
The nationalization and tighter government control over the major banks was&#13;
aimed at reducing the Banks' concentration of economic power and their&#13;
influence on industrial and business monopolies, and at increasing the flow&#13;
of credit to small businesses and industries. It was intended that these&#13;
measures would achieve a wider spread of bank credit, prevent its misuse,&#13;
direct a large flow of credit to priority sectors and make banks more effec-&#13;
tive instruments of economic progress. In short, the significant changes in&#13;
banking were aimed at increasing the role of banks as catalytic agents of&#13;
development.&#13;
1.5     The changes in the banking structure have succeeded in: (a) widening&#13;
the geographical coverage and spreading banking into rural areas;&#13;
(b) increasing mobilization of deposits; and (c) reallocating bank credit&#13;
in favor of people with limited means and in favor of sectors and activities&#13;
previously neglected. In addition, however, these have resulted in an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
increasing degree of public ownership and control of financial institutions&#13;
and consequently has reduced the operational autonomy of their managements.&#13;
The major government policies aimed at controlling the scope and operations&#13;
of the commercial banking system is reviewed in Chapters 3 and 4.&#13;
1.6     Commercial banking in India is largely of the branch banking type.&#13;
It consists of scheduled and non-scheduled banks, the former accounting for&#13;
an overwhelmingly large proportion of total commercial bank assets&#13;
(99.9%).1/ In June 1982 there were 201 scheduled banks and four non-&#13;
scheduled banks. The status of scheduled banks confers to them several&#13;
advantages such as: (a) eligibility for refinance facilities from RBI; and&#13;
(b) possibility of being granted a license to handle foreign exchange&#13;
business. Out of the 201 scheduled commercial banks, 121 were regional&#13;
rural banks, 28 were public sector banks and 52 were private (including 18&#13;
foreign banks). Regional rural banks (RRBs) have been set up starting from&#13;
1976 under the Regional Rural Bank Act. They are established for the provi-&#13;
sion of credit to the weaker sections of the rural population, particularly&#13;
to small and marginal farmers, agricultural workers, artisans, etc. RRBs&#13;
are authorized to provide short, medium and long-term credit. If they are&#13;
sponsored by any commercial bank, RRBs can be set up in any State or Union&#13;
territory with an authorized capital of Rs 10 million and issued capital of&#13;
Rs 2.5 million, of which 50% is subscribed by the Central Government, 15% by&#13;
the concerned State government and the balance left to the sponsor bank. In&#13;
addition, the sponsoring bank aids the RRB by recruiting and training&#13;
personnel and providing managerial and financial assistance. To ensure&#13;
their viability, the Reserve Bank of India has granted concessions to the&#13;
RRBs. For instance, they have direct access to RBI for refinancing assis-&#13;
tance at 3% below the Bank rate, they are allowed to maintain a lower level&#13;
of statutory liquidity than the commercial banks and to pay 1/2 per cent&#13;
more interest on all deposits than commercial banks (except deposits of&#13;
three years and above).&#13;
1.7     There is both support and criticism of Regional Rural Banks.   The&#13;
rationale behind establishing RRBs is that there are rural areas where&#13;
commercial banks would not like to have their branches because of the high&#13;
operating cost. However, public sector banks have indicated that many State&#13;
Governments are not very supportive of setting new RRBs because they fear&#13;
that they will compete with the cooperative credit institutions. The&#13;
Committee on Functioning of Public Sector Banks indicated that this fear is&#13;
unfounded and that there is ample scope for coexistence of cooperative and&#13;
commercial banks in rural areas.2/ Although some of the RRBs have become&#13;
viable, others have not and will find this very difficult due to lack of&#13;
1/ A scheduled bank is registered in the Bank schedule of the RBI after&#13;
fulfilling the following conditions: it must (a) have paid-up capital&#13;
and reserves of at least Rs 500,000; (b) be a limited company in the&#13;
sense of the Indian Companies Act or founded by special charter or by&#13;
law; and (c) abide by RBI and central government regulations.&#13;

potential in the area or excessive competition from other banks,&#13;
particularly cooperatives.&#13;
1.8     The main problems of RRBs are the high level of overdues and their&#13;
low profitability. At the end of 1982, the overdues of all RRBs amounted to&#13;
Rs 1.3 billion or about 22.2 per cent of their total loans outstanding. The&#13;
position is likely to deteriorate in the near future unless the RRBs take&#13;
special measures to reduce the overdues such as: (a) upgrading loan&#13;
appraisal methods; (b) undertaking detailed analysis of their arrears port-&#13;
folios to identify deliberate defaulters from those with serious problems,&#13;
and to isolate the cause of the problems; (c) strengthening collection&#13;
procedures and loan supervision, and (d) drawing up a phased program for&#13;
reduction of arrears to be closely monitored. Profitability is also a major&#13;
concern; 39 per cent of the 107 established RRBs incurred losses in 1981.&#13;
Several RRBs have accumulated losses which exceed the total amount of their&#13;
paid-up-capital. Low profitability is due to various reasons: (a) high&#13;
overdues, (b) low spreads between average lending rate and cost of borrowing&#13;
(this occurs because RRBs' lending is confined to the weaker sections and at&#13;
low interest rates), (c) inadequate staff resources, and (d) rapid branch&#13;
expansion without careful assessment of viability or adequacy of infrastruc-&#13;
ture facilities.&#13;
1.9     The important feature to note in Table 1.1 is the overwhelming&#13;
importance of public sector banks on the total assets, deposits and credits&#13;
of the commercial banking system. Commercial bank assets totalled Rs 582.2&#13;
billion as of December 1980. 90.5% of the assets belong to public sector&#13;
banks with the State Bank of India and its seven associates jointly holding&#13;
31.3% of the total. Private sector banks account for 8.8% of total assets&#13;
and regional rural banks for the remaining 0.7%. The distribution of&#13;
deposits and credits between the various types of banks also follow a&#13;
similar pattern: the share of public sector banks is about 91%, that of&#13;
private sector banks about 8%, regional rural banks account for 0.9% and&#13;
non-scheduled banks for 0.1%.&#13;

1.10    The vast increase in the number of banks and the spread of branches&#13;
into rural areas during the past 15 years, while welcome, have placed severe&#13;
strains in the organizational, financial and administrative capacity of the&#13;
banks. Analysis of financial data of scheduled commercial banks shows that&#13;
the profitability of commercial banks has declined overtime. For example,&#13;
the ratio of profits before tax to total earnings was 21% in 1956, 23% in&#13;
1961, 11% in 1969, averaged 10% in 1975-78 and 9% in 1979-80. Profit before&#13;
taxes as a percentage of deposits also declined from 1.1% in the early&#13;
1960's to 0.9% in the late 1970s.1/ Bank profitability has deteriorated due&#13;
to the combination of the following factors: (a) higher administrative cost&#13;
related to lending to priority sectors and opening of branches in rural and&#13;

priority sectors, particularly to agriculture; (c) interest rate subsidies&#13;
for various activities such as agricultural credit, small industry,&#13;
differential rate of interest scheme, and other borrowers at concessional&#13;
terms; (d) increasing amount of bank funds locked up in "sick industries";&#13;
(e) higher cost of funds caused by upward trend in interest rates on&#13;
deposits and higher proportion of term deposits on total bank deposits;&#13;
(f) increases in reserve requirements which result in significant amounts of&#13;
resources deployed in low-yielding assets; and (g) outdated systems and&#13;
procedures which do not optimize the use of manpower.&#13;

1.11    Indian scheduled banks also appear to be somewhat overstaffed.    In&#13;
1979 they had 520,000 employees, or about 18 per branch; in 1982 the average&#13;
increased to 20. Consequently salaries and administrative expenses&#13;
accounted for 22 percent of the total expenses of nationalized banks, while&#13;
it accounted for only 18% for foreign banks operating in India.&#13;
C. POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK (POSB)&#13;
1.12    The Post Office Savings Bank, is run by the Post and Telegraph&#13;
Department on behalf of the Ministry of Finance with the National Savings&#13;
Organization being responsible for promotional work and publicity. The&#13;
Postal saving system operates through the network of post offices which&#13;
allows it to reach remote corners of the country catering to the savings of&#13;
the lower income population that do not want to venture to commercial banks&#13;
which they may see as too sophisticated. The Post Office Bank gets a large&#13;
proportion of its deposits from rural areas: 38% of the deposits and 30% of&#13;
its resources come from villages. The average size of the post office&#13;
savings account is about Rs 560 while that for an average bank account is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
about Rs 940. The POSB accounts for about 17% of total aggregate deposits&#13;
while banks account for 83%.&#13;
1.13    The POSB collects funds through various savings schemes such as:&#13;
(a) savings bank accounts carrying an interest of 5.5% per annum;&#13;
(b) recurring and cumulative time deposit schemes; (c) time deposits with 1,&#13;
2, 3 and 5 year maturities; (d) Public Provident Funds with 15 years&#13;
maturity, offering a tax-free interest of 8.5% per annum. Annual deposits&#13;
vary from Rs 100 to Rs 30,000; (e) National Saving Certificates (NSC) issued&#13;
at intervals; and (f) Social Security Certificates, introduced in 1982, with&#13;
10-year maturity, paying three times the investment at maturity (rate of&#13;
interest 11.6% per annum) and providing social security benefits.&#13;

1.14    These POSB schemes offer higher returns than those of scheduled&#13;
banks and provide a variety of alternative investment possibilities coupled&#13;
with tax saving features,l/ thereby attracting higher income groups as well&#13;
as small savers. A major drawback of the Postal Office Saving system is its&#13;
inefficiency, related to outdated systems and procedures. This explains why&#13;
POSB does not account for a larger share of the deposits market even though&#13;
it offers yields with tax benefits and safety comparable to, or better than,&#13;
any bank.&#13;
1/ Tax concessions vary depending on the savings scheme selected. Some&#13;
investments provide full shelter from income tax on interest receipts or&#13;
from wealth-tax, while others offer more limited tax concessions.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONAL FINANCE FOR INDUSTRY&#13;
1.15    Since independence in 1947, several institutions have been estab-&#13;
lished by the Government to provide long-term credit. Thus, India has a&#13;
large number of term financing institutions, which were set up to promote&#13;
and provide long-term finance to viable investment projects in industry and&#13;
agriculture. Some of these institutions operate on a national basis (all-&#13;
India institutions) while others operate within regions or States.&#13;
1.16    The all-India institutions, under the direction of the Central&#13;
Government, specialize in lending to medium and large industries, with some&#13;
also providing refinance and indirect assistance to other financial institu-&#13;
tions and smaller industrial units. The regional and state institutions&#13;
controlled by State Governments concentrate on small and medium industrial&#13;
units. These financial institutions obtain their resources partly from the&#13;
Government and partly as loans or refinancing from the capital market. The&#13;
assistance provided by these institutions is quantitatively important in the&#13;
financing of corporate investment. All these development finance institu-&#13;
tions not only provide term loans but also provide equity capital and are,&#13;
therefore, shareholders in many enterprises. This enhances the role of the&#13;
institutions in providing support to industrial units in the areas of&#13;
management and finance.&#13;
1.17    The principal all-India industrial finance institutions are the&#13;
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the Industrial Credit and&#13;
Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), Industrial Finance Corporation of&#13;
India (IFCI), Life Insurance Corporation of India, and Unit Trust of India&#13;
(UTI). At the regional or State level, the most important institutions are&#13;
the State Financial Corporations (SFCs), which finance small and medium&#13;
scale industries and the State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs)&#13;
which mainly promote and help finance larger industries having direct State&#13;
shareholding. Other institutions at the State level, which also provide&#13;
financial assistance, are State Small Industries Corporations (SSICs) which&#13;
allocate and distribute raw materials to small industries and provide some&#13;
hire-purchase finance, and State Small Industries Development Corporations&#13;
(SSIDCs) whose main activities are to establish and manage industrial&#13;
estates. Table 1.4 shows the major financial institutions providing funds&#13;
to industry.&#13;
1.18    An important feature of the system for industrial finance in India&#13;
is the participation of major investment institutions in consortium financ-&#13;
ing with other all-India financial institutions. The Unit Trust of India&#13;
(UTI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), and General Insurance&#13;
Corporation (GIC), work closely with other all-India financial institutions&#13;
to meet the financial requirements of the industrial sector. In order to&#13;
facilitate the application process for financial assistance, the modalities&#13;
of the consortium finance have been streamlined. The institutions have&#13;
introduced common application forms, the "lead" institution concept and the&#13;
Project Financing Participation Scheme. Proposals for project assistance&#13;
are now submitted in a common application form to one of the institutions&#13;
which forwards copies to the other institutions. The "lead institution"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
appraises the project in association with the other participating institu-&#13;
tions and sanctions assistance after the sharing of assistance is decided in&#13;
inter-institutional meetings.&#13;
1.19    The following sections discuss the functioning of the major institu-&#13;
tions providing finance for industry, looking at: (a) the structure of&#13;
their capital and ownership, (b) their rationale and major activities, and&#13;
(c) their outstanding features.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
All-India Financial Institutions&#13;
1.20    Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) - IDBI has been respon-&#13;
sible for coordinating term finance institutions for industry since 1964.&#13;
The IDBI was established in response to the perceived need for an apex&#13;
institution which would coordinate the operations of the industrial finance&#13;
institutions which, although quite large in number and diversity, did not&#13;
adequately meet the requirements of medium and long-term finance nor of&#13;
rendering promotional services to the industry. Founded as a subsidiary of&#13;
the RBI, it holds an interest of 50% in the Industrial Finance Corporation&#13;
of India (IFCI). It is the largest development bank in India and formal&#13;
coordinator of other term-financing institutions. It provides financing to&#13;
SFCs and SIDCs through refinance and bills discounting facilities and equity&#13;
participation and refinances commercial banks. It also finances industry&#13;
directly and provides technical and administrative assistance through estab-&#13;
lishment of and support to Technical Consultancy Organizations (TCOs).&#13;
1.21    During the last five years there has been a marked shift in the&#13;
composition of assistance in favor of small and medium enterprises under&#13;
IDBI's indirect schemes (refinance of industrial loans and rediscounting of&#13;
bills for sale of indigenous machinery on defined basis). Direct assistance&#13;
which formed 37% of total assistance in 1978/79 gradually declined to 27% in&#13;
1982/83. This shift was allowed by improved conditions in the capital&#13;
markets and greater participation by GIC and UTI in consortium financing.&#13;
In 1982/83 assistance sanctioned by IDBI was distributed as follows: direct&#13;
project finance (22%), underwriting and direct subscriptions (1.6%),&#13;
refinance of industrial loans (49%), rediscounting of bills (21%), soft&#13;
loans (1.7%), subscription to shares and loan of financial institutions&#13;
(2.6%), and others (2.1%).&#13;
1.22    In 1982/83, IDBI's total fund requirements for disbursement of&#13;
assistance, repayment of borrowings, and interest and dividend payments&#13;
amounted to RS 18.8 billion. Internal generation of funds met 47.1% of the&#13;
requirement, and the balance was covered by market borrowings (27.8%),&#13;
borrowings from RBI (16.5%), increased COI share capital (1.6%), and others&#13;
(7%).&#13;
1.23    The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)&#13;
was founded in 1955 and is owned and financed mainly by the private sector.&#13;
Participation in its capital are from commercial banks, insurance companies,&#13;
local limited companies, private persons, and various foreign insurance and&#13;
limited companies. It promotes private enterprises in three ways; firstly,&#13;
it offers medium- and long-term loans, share and debenture underwriting,&#13;
equity participation, loan guarantees and provision of managerial and tech-&#13;
nical assistance to enterprises; secondly, it lends heavily to non-&#13;
traditional sub-sectors such as chemicals and petrochemicals, electrical&#13;
equipment and electronics and mechanical engineering, and thirdly, it&#13;
provides the most important institutional source of foreign exchange financ-&#13;
ing for private industry, accounting for over three-fourths of foreign&#13;
exchange financing by all of the institutions. There are no firm limits on&#13;
the size of an enterprise ICICI is prepared to assist, nor is there a maxi-&#13;
mum or minimum limit on the investment it will make. In addition, to&#13;
industrial finance, ICICI also lends for rural development projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
1.24    ICICI has the strongest financial position of all the institutions&#13;
providing industrial finance. In 1982/83 internal generation of funds met&#13;
44.2% of requirements, the balance being provided by market borrowings&#13;
(53.6%) and borrowings from GOI/RBI/IDBI (2.2%). Overdues as a percentage&#13;
of aggregate outstanding assistance were 2.6Z, the lowest of all the&#13;
institutions in the consortium (compared with 4.8% for IDBI, 4.3% for IFCI&#13;
and 19.1% for SFCs).&#13;
1.25    Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), was founded in 1948,&#13;
with its ownership held jointly by public and private sector institutions.&#13;
Participating in its capital are the IDBI (50%), scheduled banks,&#13;
cooperatives, other banks, insurance companies, investment trusts, etc. It&#13;
lends and invests only in limited private and public sector companies or&#13;
cooperatives engaged in manufacturing, shipping, mining, hotels and power.&#13;
IFCI's assistance is available for setting up new industrial projects and&#13;
also for the expansion, diversification or modernization of existing ones.&#13;
Assistance may take the form of long-term loans, underwriting and subscrib-&#13;
ing to equity, preference and debentures issues, and guarantees. In&#13;
1982/83, IFCI financed 46% of its fund requirements from internal&#13;
generation, 11% from GOI/IDBI lending and 43% from other market borrowing.&#13;
1.26    The Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India (IRCI) was&#13;
founded in 1971 originally to provide financial and technical assistance for&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation of sick industrial enterprises in West&#13;
Bengal; however, in recent years, it has expanded its operations beyond West&#13;
Bengal. IDBI holds 50% of its capital, the balance being provided by IFC,&#13;
ICICI, the State Bank, the nationalized banks and the Life Insurance&#13;
Corporation of India.&#13;
1.27    IRCI was the only organization dealing mainly with "sick" industrial&#13;
units, but did not have the power to bring about structural changes either&#13;
in the management or finances of the assisted units. In 1982/83 internal&#13;
generation of funds contributed to 12.6% of IRCI's fund requirements, bond&#13;
issued raised 12.5%, and the balance was met by borrowings, subsidies, and&#13;
incentives from Government. In July 1984, a new bank was formed, the&#13;
Industrial Reconstruction and Development Bank of India (IRDBI), which will&#13;
take over the operations of IRCI. IRDBI will be an independent organization&#13;
like IDBI and will have power to revive, liquidate, sell and order mergers&#13;
of industrial units assisted by it. In order to avoid the financial&#13;
problems of IRCI (low internal generation of funds and very high level of&#13;
overdues), IRDBI will embrace a wider spectrum of industries.&#13;
1.28    Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM BANK) was established in 1982 to&#13;
strengthen the institutional framework for encouraging the export of non-&#13;
traditional products. It finances, facilitates, and promotes foreign trade&#13;
of India and coordinates the work of institutions engaged in financing&#13;
exports and imports. EXIM BANK started its operations with an authorized&#13;
capital of Rs 2 billion, which can be increased to Rs 5 billion. As on&#13;
December 31, 1983, its resources comprised paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion,&#13;
long-term loans of Rs 450 million from GOI and Rs 1,250 million from the&#13;
RBI, and Rs 1,522.76 million due to IDBI on transfer of export loans. In&#13;
1983, the Bank also raised Rs 530 million in the domestic bond market and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
two Euro-dollar loans aggregating US$50 million. During 1983 the Bank's&#13;
commitments aggregated Rs 3,138 million.&#13;
Investment Companies Providing Industrial Finance&#13;
1.29    The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was founded in 1956 by&#13;
the nationalization and merger of about 250 independent life insurance&#13;
societies. Its main purpose is to carry on life insurance business, but has&#13;
gradually developed into a specialized all-India financial institution. It&#13;
plays an important role in the capital market of the country and is one of&#13;
the two largest and most successful institutional investors in India. By&#13;
law, it must invest 25% of its funds in Government securities and a further&#13;
25% in "approved" securities. It also invests in infrastructural&#13;
facilities, housing and industry. LIC is the most important institution&#13;
underwriting equity and debenture issues for the industrial sector.&#13;
1.30    Apart from underwriting and purchasing corporate securities, LIC&#13;
finances private industry through subscriptions to the shares and bonds of&#13;
industrial financial institutions and also provides finance to corporate&#13;
enterprises in the form of direct loans. A notable feature of LIC's long-&#13;
term assistance to industry has been its rising share of loan assistance&#13;
as against underwriting and direct subscription. In 1981/82, 76.5% of LIC's&#13;
total assistance to industry was in the form of loans, while the remaining&#13;
23.5 was in subscriptions. However, although LIC direct financing to&#13;
industry has grown considerably, loans sanctioned by LIC constitute only&#13;
about 1% of total private corporate capital formation.&#13;
1.31    The General Insurance Corporation (GIC) was formed when the manage-&#13;
ment of general insurance businesses in India was taken over by the&#13;
Government in 1971 and subsequently nationalized in 1973. According to&#13;
Government guidelines, 70% of annual additions to investible funds have to&#13;
be invested in "socially-oriented" sectors. Such investments include&#13;
Central and State Government securities, bonds and debentures of public&#13;
sector undertakings and also loans on soft terms to State Governments and&#13;
other agencies engaged in housing and urban development. Total investments&#13;
of the GIC stood at Rs 12.8 billion in 1982. About one-half was invested in&#13;
Government and other approved securities, one-third in shares and&#13;
debentures, term loans and deposits with companies, and the balance in loans&#13;
to banks on participation certificates and bills rediscounting schemes.&#13;
1.32    Unit Trust of India (UTI), was founded in 1964 and in 1976 became&#13;
an associate institution of IDBI. It is the largest mutual fund in India.&#13;
Initial ownership was split as follows: RBI 50%, LIC 15%, State Bank of&#13;
India 15%, and other banks and financial institutions 20%. Beyond the&#13;
initial capital, UTI raises funds by the sale of small denominations&#13;
(units). The yield from these units, which is market-based, is tax free up&#13;
to Rs 5000. UTI encourages savings by middle and low-income groups, and&#13;
channels these funds to industrial development. It thus enables small&#13;
savers to invest in industry without exposing their savings to undue risk.&#13;
The UTI is a major underwriter of public shares and debenture issues, and&#13;
has emerged as an important institutional holder of corporate securities in&#13;
the industrial securities market vis-a-vis the other financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
The establishment of the UTI has enlarged the market for industrial&#13;
securities.&#13;
1.33    UTI's investible funds reached Rs 8.7 billion at the end of 1982/83,&#13;
of which 81.3% were placed in the industrial corporate sector. In 1982/83,&#13;
UTI provided Rs 1.3 billion in direct assistance to the corporate sector,&#13;
55% in the form of privately placed debentures and the balance in the form&#13;
of underwriting, direct subscriptions, firm allotments and rights issues.&#13;
State Level Industrial Finance Corporations&#13;
1.34    State Financial Corporations (SFCs), have been established in&#13;
capital cities of 18 federal states; most of them as a result of the State&#13;
Financial Corporation Act of 1951. Their shareholders are the respective&#13;
federal State governments, the IDBI, credit cooperatives, insurance&#13;
companies, investment trusts and private shareholders. Private ownership&#13;
cannot exceed 25% of SFCs total capital. SFCs obtain additional capital by&#13;
taking deposits from the public, borrowing from State governments and the&#13;
RBI, and refinancing loans with IDBI. External resources accounted for 66%&#13;
of total funds required in 1982/83, 63% of which was provided by IDBI&#13;
through refinancing and 26% were borrowed from GOI and RBI. The assistance&#13;
of SFCs to industrial units is mainly through: (a) offering loans for&#13;
acquisition of fixed assets; (b) guaranteeing for loans received by&#13;
industrial undertakings from scheduled banks or State Cooperative Banks;&#13;
(c) guaranteeing deferred payments dues from any industrial concern in&#13;
connection with purchase of capital goods; and (d) underwriting the issues&#13;
of stocks, shares, bonds or debentures of industrial units.&#13;
1.35    A disquieting feature of SFCs' operations has been the growing level&#13;
of overdues. Total overdues, which were Rs 0. 92 billion in March 1977 and&#13;
Rs 1.75 billion in March 1979, have increased to Rs 2.25 billion in March&#13;
1981, and Rs 2.67 billion in March 1982. By comparison disbursement of&#13;
assistance in 1981/82 was Rs 3.15 billion. Overdues therefore constitute&#13;
19% of total loans outstanding. The recovery performance varies widely&#13;
among the SFCs. During the past two years, several SFCs have been&#13;
implementing measures to improve the recovery position, with encouraging&#13;
results. As a result, the share of overdues to total loans outstanding&#13;
declined from 27% in March 1981 to 23% in March 1982 and 19% in March 1983.&#13;
1.36    The persistence of major problems in most SFCs calls for remedial&#13;
action. The following are some areas of SFCs' operations which should be&#13;
addressed: (a) high turnover of staff at management levels: (b) inability&#13;
to attract and retain experienced professional staff; (c) inadequate manage-&#13;
ment information systems; (d) major deficiencies in appraisal procedures;&#13;
(e) weak supervision and collection procedures, and (f) high growth in&#13;
operations not supported by adequate organizational structures to appraise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
and supervise operations and provide appropriate technical assistance to&#13;
borrowers .l/&#13;
1.37    The Industrial Development Corporations, which exist both at the&#13;
federal level (NIDC) and at the State level (SIDC) are not exclusively&#13;
financial institutions. Their original aim was to promote those industries&#13;
necessary to fill gaps in the industrial infrastructure. To achieve this,&#13;
the institutions were provided with financial resources and technical and&#13;
commercial know-how. Unfortunately, the NIDC has not lived up to expecta-&#13;
tions and has remained as an agency of the Ministry of Industrial&#13;
Development, merely undertaking investigations of publicly-owned industrial&#13;
projects. The SIDCs, on the contrary, have recorded sustained growth in&#13;
their operations. The main activities carried out by SIDCs are: (a)&#13;
granting financial assistance to medium-scale industrial units in the form&#13;
of loans, guarantees and underwriting or directly subscribing to shares and&#13;
debentures; (b) promoting industrial development through preparing techno-&#13;
economic surveys and feasibility studies, identifying projects, and select-&#13;
ing and training entrepeneurs; (c) administering various State Government&#13;
incentive schemes; (d) developing industrial areas, constructing sheds and&#13;
providing infrastructural facilities; and (e) promoting joint sector&#13;
projects in association with private promoters. Because of this record,&#13;
IDBI has extended refinance assistance to SIDCs since 1976, and at present&#13;
25 SDICs are eligible for refinance assistance. External sources accounted&#13;
for 65% of total fund requirements in 1982/83 and IDBI provided 49% of&#13;
external funds mobilized. The aggregate sanctions of SIDCs recorded an&#13;
almost three-fold increase from Rs 0.98 billion in 1978/79 to Rs 2.97&#13;
billion in 1982/83.&#13;
1.38    As in the case of SFCs, the arrears position and poor recovery&#13;
performance are major concerns. Total outstanding arrears at the end of&#13;
1982/83 was Rs 648 million, 34% higher than the year before.    There were&#13;
wide variations in the recovery rates of SIDCs, with Gujarat achieving 71%&#13;
while Assam only achieved 6.2%. Ten SIDCs had recovery rates which ranged&#13;
between 40% and 50%.&#13;
1.39    The National Small Industries Corporation Limited (NSIC), a&#13;
government-funded institution, established in 1955, promotes the development&#13;
of small industrial units.2/ It only extends financial assistance through&#13;
its hire-purchase operations. It provides services such as: (a) securing&#13;
contracts from the Central Government Stores Purchasing agencies;&#13;
(b) exporting products of small industries; (c) training industrial workers&#13;
and supervisors in its Prototype Development and Training Centers;&#13;
(d) constructing and managing industrial estates; (e) supplying imported&#13;

and indigenous machinery and equipment on easy installments under its hire-&#13;
purchase scheme; (f) distributing scarce raw materials and other components&#13;
at comparatively less expensive rates than suppliers' credits; and&#13;
(g) refinancing various schemes of the State Small Industries Development&#13;
Corporations (SSIDCs). Besides its headquarters in Delhi, it has regional&#13;
offices in Bombay, Madras and Calcutta and sub-offices in other major&#13;
cities. The NSIC is wholly owned by the Union Government. It supplements&#13;
its financial resources through borrowings and grants from the GOI, and by&#13;
foreign credits and loans from banking institutions. Although NSIC does&#13;
make a significant contribution to the promotion of small industry, its role&#13;
as financier is rather small because of inadequate financing and low&#13;
replicability of its hire-purchase operations due to inadequate project&#13;
appraisal and low recovery of principal and interest.&#13;
1.40    The development finance institutions occupy an important place in&#13;
industrial planning and promotion. The seven all-India institutions 1/&#13;
together account for about three-fourths of the assistance sanctioned by all&#13;
term financial institutions, including SFCs and SIDCs. The State level&#13;
institutions (SFCs and SIDCs) also occupy an important role in industrial&#13;
promotion but are much weaker institutions in terms of human, financial and&#13;
administrative resources. In order to strengthen these institutions, state&#13;
Governments should study the possibility of restructuring them to reduce&#13;
duplication of activities and to improve their administration and finances.&#13;
E. AGRICULTURAL FINANCING INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.41    A thorough review of agricultural finance will not be attempted here&#13;
due to the diversity of institutions and complexity of the system. Thus,&#13;
only a brief description of the system and of its major institutions will be&#13;
made to indicate the linkages with the rest of the financial system. Chart&#13;
2 shows the complexity of the existing institutional set up for rural&#13;
finance. In addition, this section will analyze major issues in agricul-&#13;
tural finance.&#13;
1.42    India has followed the "multi-agency" approach in providing rural&#13;
finance. Under this approach, cooperative, commercial, regional banks and&#13;
other field level institutions provide rural finance and are supported by&#13;
Central and State Governments and national level institutions such as the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural&#13;
Development, the National Cooperative Development Corporation and the&#13;
Industrial Development Bank of India. The field level institutions which&#13;
provide credit to individual borrowers are: (a) primary agricultural&#13;
cooperative credit societies providing both short-term and medium-term&#13;
credit to their members; (b) primary cooperative land development banks or&#13;
branches of State cooperative land development banks providing long-term&#13;
credit to their members; (c) branches of commercial banks, and (d) branches&#13;
of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). Of the total agricultural credit outstand-&#13;
ing at the end of June 1980, cooperatives accounted for 59.4%, commercial&#13;
banks for 38.8% and RRBs for 1.8%.&#13;

National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD)&#13;
1.43    NABARD is the apex institution in the field of credit for agricul-&#13;
ture and other rural economic activities such as small-scale industries,&#13;
cottage and village industries, handicrafts and other crafts. It was set up&#13;
in 1982 to coordinate agricultural credit and provide loans and refinance&#13;
assistance to the financial institutions operating in the sector. It has&#13;
taken over the entire undertaking of the former Agricultural Refinance and&#13;
Development Corporation (ARDC) as well as the Reserve Bank's functions in&#13;
the sphere of coordination and refinancing of rural credit. NABARD will&#13;
provide the same refinance facilities which were available from ARDC to&#13;
commercial banks, RRBs, State Land Development Banks (SLDBs) and State&#13;
Cooperative Banks (SCBs). In addition, the refinance assistance previously&#13;
given by the Reserve Bank will be provided to RRBs and SCBs. Thus, it is&#13;
empowered to provide short, medium, and long-term assistance.&#13;
1.44    In addition to its role as refinancing agency in the sector, it&#13;
also: (a) provides institution building facilities; (b) coordinates the&#13;
rural financing activities of all the institutions involved; (c) monitors&#13;
and evaluates agricultural development projects it has refinanced and&#13;
(d) invests in share capital or securities of institutions concerned with&#13;
agriculture and rural development.&#13;
The National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC)&#13;
1.45    NCDC was established in 1962 to promote and finance projects and&#13;
programs carried out by agricultural and agro-industrial Cooperative&#13;
Societies. NCDC is authorized to advance loans, provide grants and&#13;
subsidies, and participate in the share capital of cooperative enterprises&#13;
with inter-State activities. NCDC has promoted projects involving grain&#13;
storage, sugar factories, oil extraction, ginneries, spinning mills, dis-&#13;
tribution of fertilizer, etc., marketing of agricultural produce and trade&#13;
of consumer goods in rural areas. Its role is not limited to that of an&#13;
investment financing institution, but includes technical and managerial&#13;
support to the subproject investors during the course of subproject&#13;
implementation and in the operational phase. NCDC has, over the years,&#13;
acquired considerable experience in the implementation of agro-processing&#13;
projects on the technical as well as managerial level.&#13;
1.46    In contrast to NABARD's sole responsibility at the national level&#13;
for refinancing agricultural credit to cooperative and commercial banks,&#13;
NCDC specializes in project lending. NCDC lends through some of the same&#13;
financial intermediaries which NABARD refinances (SCBs and SLDBs), but its&#13;
loans are used for investments by Cooperative Societies and not individual&#13;
farmers, and the number of subloans is much smaller than NABARD's. NCDC's&#13;
funds consist of grants and loans from GOI, retained earnings, and borrow-&#13;
ings from the market. Unlike NABARD, it is not entitled to refinance its&#13;
loans through the Reserve Bank.&#13;
Cooperative Credit System&#13;
1.47    The cooperative credit system provides short, medium and long-term&#13;
financing. The cooperative credit structure for short- and medium-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
credit is a three-tier federal structure with a State Cooperative Bank (SCB)&#13;
at the apex level in each State, the Central Cooperative Bank (CCB) at the&#13;
district level in each State and the Primary Cooperative Societies (PCS) and&#13;
Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) at the base. State Land&#13;
Development Banks (SLDBs) are the apex cooperative institutions engaged in&#13;
long-term lending for agriculture. Together with commercial banks they are&#13;
the only sources of formal long-term credit to individual farmers. SLDBs&#13;
function through branches or affiliated Primary Land Development Banks&#13;
(PLDBs) providing development loans for periods up to 15 years, mostly&#13;
refinanced by NABARD.&#13;
1.48    The financial performance of the various types of cooperatives&#13;
varies significantly. While SCBs ad SLDBs are generally profitable and have&#13;
low overdues, the Primary Cooperatives and Credit Societies show weak&#13;
finances and large overdues. Furthermore, while the State and Central&#13;
cooperative banks have been able to mobilize deposits to contribute a large&#13;
proportion of their working funds, the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies&#13;
have failed in promoting and mobilizing savings from their members.&#13;
Deposits in SCBs make up for about 60% of their working capital and own&#13;
funds finance 12%. The CCB's own funds constitute 16% of working capital&#13;
and deposits make up about 50%. In contrast, the PACS depend on borrowings&#13;
from other financing agencies to fund about 74% of their working capital.&#13;
The PACS are plagued with financial difficulties of which the most important&#13;
is the high percentage of overdues to loans outstanding, which stood at&#13;
about 44% as of June 1981. Table 1.5 provides some major indicators of the&#13;
performance of the cooperative movement in India.&#13;
Issues in Agricultural Finance&#13;
1.49    The main issues in agricultural finance are (a) poor loan recovery&#13;
and high overdues; (b) high cost of agricultural credit; and (c) prolifera-&#13;
tion of institutions. These problems will only be solved by undertaking a&#13;
rehabilitation program which includes (a) restructuring of institutions;&#13;
(b) upgrading and strengthening field level staff; (c) improving managerial&#13;
and supervising capacity; and (d) reducing political interference in loan&#13;
recovery efforts.&#13;
1.50    During the 1970s, the volume of short, medium, and long-term&#13;
institutional credit disbursed to farmers grew substantially, practically&#13;
tripling in nominal terms and increasing annually by 4.5% in real terms.&#13;
However, the ability of the rural credit administration to handle this&#13;
expansion, while maintaining adequate quality control, has grown much more&#13;
slowly. Overstrained managerial capacity, inadequate and poorly trained&#13;
field level staff and lack of effective procedures for supervision, monitor-&#13;
ing and evaluation of credit disbursements have resulted in extremely poor&#13;
loan recovery and high overdues. Political interference by state govern-&#13;
ments in loan recovery efforts have exacerbated this problem. Overdues have&#13;
been particularly high for long-term credit, hovering around 50% for the&#13;
last several years. Both commercial and cooperative banks are affected, but&#13;
the latter have suffered more acutely since their loan portfolios have been&#13;
concentrated on agricultural lending, particularly for private wells. Many&#13;
cooperatives have been forced to restrict lending and sizeable state govern-&#13;
ment subsidies are needed to keep them solvent. The impact of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
constraints is evident in the virtual stagnation in the growth of real&#13;
credit since the start of the Sixth Plan. The need to begin what will be&#13;
a slow process of rehabilitation is urgent. It is essential that steps be&#13;
taken to upgrade and strengthen field level staff while improving coordina-&#13;
tion between credit institutions and other agencies related to credit&#13;
operations.&#13;
1.51    According to the 1981 Report of the Committee to Review Arrange-&#13;
ments for Institutional Credit for Agriculture and Rural Development&#13;
(CRAFICARD), the principal reasons for overdues are: (a) failure to tie up&#13;
lending with productive investments; (b) neglect of/or absence of efforts&#13;
for marketing arrangements and linkage of credit recovery with sale of&#13;
produce; (c) defective loan policies, including untimely loan disbursements,&#13;
underfinancing/over-financing and unrealistic scheduling of loan repayment;&#13;
(d) misapplication of loans; (e) ineffective supervision; (f) apathy and&#13;
indifference of management to take coercive measures for recovery; and&#13;
(g) lack of responsibility and sense of discipline of borrowers.l/ A&#13;
primary cause, however, of persistently high levels of overdues has been the&#13;
rapid expansion of lending in response to pressures to achieve mandated&#13;
credit distribution targets.&#13;

1.52    Another issue in agricultural finance is the current inadequate&#13;
spread between the costs of agricultural lending and the revenues from these&#13;
operations. Financial intermediaries face very high administrative costs&#13;
while lending to a multitude of small beneficiaries which are not covered by&#13;
appropriate rate spreads. Agricultural lenders have to rely on Government&#13;
subsidies or cross-subsidize their agricultural credit operations from other&#13;
profitable activities. Since interest rates are regulated by the&#13;
Government, this problem will only be resolved by a thorough revision of the&#13;
structure of interest rates, particularly of those rates which affect&#13;
agricultural lending.&#13;
1.53    Another weakness of the agricultural credit system which has to be&#13;
addressed is the proliferation of institutions, many of which are finan-&#13;
cially not viable, and which overlap in their functions and objectives. A&#13;
restructuring of the agricultural cooperative credit system would be&#13;
beneficial. In addition further establishment of new institutions should&#13;
only be authorized after careful consideration of financial viability.&#13;
F. FINANCE COMPANIES&#13;
1.54    The private sector as well as the Government raise funds on the&#13;
stock market. As in other countries, India's financial system also has&#13;
non-banking financial intermediaries which compete with banks in the mobi-&#13;
lization of deposits and in credit allocation. So far these companies have&#13;
not played an important role in influencing the direction of savings and&#13;
investment or in mobilizing financial flows. The major types of financial&#13;
companies are: hire-purchase finance companies, leasing companies, invest-&#13;
ment companies, housing finance companies, loan companies or finance&#13;
corporations, and mutual benefit financial companies. They are mainly&#13;
engaged in financing industry by advancing loans, in financing hire-purchase&#13;
operations, providing leasing facilities, trading in shares and securities&#13;
and investing in securities in general. Some also function as merchant&#13;
bankers (for example the brokerage system is very well developed for company&#13;
deposits, and this has been a unique feature of the Indian markets since&#13;
1860). As in the case of non-financial companies, financial companies are&#13;
only allowed to accept deposits from the public with short-term maturities&#13;
(up to 3 years), thus they do not operate in the long-term financial market.&#13;
1.55    There are also some investment companies and unit trusts which&#13;
mobilize savings and invest them in industrial securities with the objective&#13;
of providing a good return to savers while reducing risks through&#13;
diversification. Of these companies only Unit Trust of India has a large&#13;
role in the Indian financial system. Recently, since 1983 several private&#13;
unit trusts or mutual funds have been set up in India. Their success will&#13;
depend on management capabilities, sources of finances, cost of finance and&#13;
deployment possibilities. The Government is currently contemplating the&#13;
relaxation of legislation concerning mutual funds aimed at accelerating the&#13;
pace of growth of the capital market, increasing competition, and providing&#13;
a wider choice to investors. Mutual funds would not only mobilize larger&#13;
resources for development but would also provide the basis for increased&#13;
activity in secondary security markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
C. STOCK AND SECURITIES MARKET&#13;
1.56    The stock market in India is regulated under the Securities Contract&#13;
(Regulation) Act of 1956. At present there are twelve Stock Exchanges&#13;
recognized by the Government which offer an organized market for shares and&#13;
debentures of joint stock companies and for gilt-edged securities. The&#13;
Bombay Stock Exchange is the leading stock market in India with the largest&#13;
number and paid-up value of listed stocks. The stock market is composed of&#13;
the new issue market, which is a primary market for raising new capital and&#13;
the stock exchange which forms the secondary market for stocks and other&#13;
securities.&#13;
1.57    The private sector as well as the Government raise funds on the&#13;
stock market. A very interesting and hardly known fact about the Indian&#13;
stock market is the overwhelming importance of Government securities in its&#13;
volume of operations as compared to industrial securities. During 1971-72&#13;
to 1977-78, new funds mobilized through the issue of government and semi-&#13;
government securities accounted for 93% to 97% of total new funds mobilized,&#13;
the balance was for funds for the private corporate sector.l/ This propor-&#13;
tion has been reduced somewhat in recent years due to increased activity in&#13;
the private capital market since 1980. This compares with the U.K. where&#13;
the government securities market is also larger than the industrial&#13;
securities market (private capital market).&#13;
1. Government Securities Market&#13;
1.58    As indicated above, the Government Securities market is the largest&#13;
segment of the India capital market. Government securities are issued by&#13;
the Central Government, State Government, and semi-Government authorities&#13;
which include local government authorities, autonomous institutions like&#13;
port trusts, state electricity boards, public sector enterprises, and other&#13;
government agencies, such as the All-India and regional financial&#13;
institutions. Central and State Government securities outstanding stood at&#13;
Rs 219.6 billion at end-March 1982, with the Central Government accounting&#13;
for 84.6%. The annual net market borrowings by the Government have&#13;
increased significantly over the last decade, increasing from Rs 2.3 billion&#13;
in 1970/71 to Rs 28.0 billion in 1980/81 (equivalent to 32% of household&#13;
financial savings). These large Government borrowings from the market (as&#13;
opposed to from the banking system) allowed India to finance a large propor-&#13;
tion of its Government deficit without increasing inflationary pressures.&#13;
1.59    Ownership of Government securities is concentrated in institutional&#13;
investors which hold about 95% of total Government securities outstanding.&#13;
In March 1982 the RBI held 23% of outstanding securities, scheduled banks&#13;
44%, LIC 11% and Provident Funds 15%. The secondary market for Government&#13;
securities operating in the stock market is very narrow since institutional&#13;
holders tend to keep the issues until maturity. Commercial banks, the&#13;
largest holders, can buy as many securities as they want, but cannot sell&#13;

securities beyond a limit due to Statutory Liquidity Reserve (SLR) require-&#13;
ments which will be analyzed later in Chapter 4. RBI's holdings allow it to&#13;
act as the regulator of market prices and that explains the price stability&#13;
which characterizes Indian Government securities.&#13;
1.60    Interest rates on Government securities are not aligned with other&#13;
rates in the financial market. Rates are lower than on bank deposits,&#13;
privately issued securities or company deposits. The main reasons for large&#13;
holdings of Government securities despite low rates are: the compulsion of&#13;
certain institutional investors to buy these securities (SLR requirements)&#13;
and their liquidity and safety. Individuals and other non-institutional&#13;
investors, such as trusts and joint-stock companies have maintained very&#13;
small holdings. Ownership by individuals.is estimated at only 1% of total&#13;
Government securities outstanding.&#13;
2. Private Capital Market&#13;
1.61    In India the private capital market does not constitute a major&#13;
instrument to mobilize savings and channel them into investment. This is&#13;
because the stock market as well as the new issue market attract an insig-&#13;
nificant proportion of household savings. Recently, the Government has&#13;
introduced fiscal and financial measures aimed at encouraging the flow of&#13;
funds into investment in shares. Resource mobilization through the capital&#13;
market has improved substantially during the past few years in response to&#13;
these policies which have affected both the demand and supply side of the&#13;
market. The corporate sector was encouraged to step up its efforts to raise&#13;
additional resources from the capital markets by certain measures such as&#13;
liberalization of industrial policy and allowing industrial firms to raise&#13;
their debt-equity ratio up to 2:1. In addition, measures such as increasing&#13;
the rate of interest of convertible and non-convertible debentures and&#13;
recent improvement in industrial performance and corporate finances&#13;
increased the interest of savers. Another measure which has increased the&#13;
savers' interest in non-convertible debentures is the authorization to&#13;
companies issuing such debentures to have a buy-back arrangement.l/ The&#13;
further simplification of procedures relating to investment by non-residents&#13;
of Indian nationality/origin and repatriation of sale proceeds of such&#13;
investments also had a positive influence in the capital market.&#13;
1.62    Table 1.6 shows the significant increase in capital market activity&#13;
which has occurred since 1980. Despite this overall increase in capital&#13;
market activity, the mobilization of resources by the private corporate&#13;
sector from this market is small when compared to household financial&#13;
savings or to the capital needs of the sector. The "Rangarajan Report"2/&#13;
1/ Under this scheme, companies can buy back non-convertible debentures&#13;
at par from any debenture holder whose holding does not exceed Rs 40,000&#13;
and who has held the debentures for a period of at least one year. This&#13;
was one of the recommendations made by the Working Group on Secondary&#13;
market for Debentures with a view to providing liquidity to investment&#13;
in non-convertible debentures short of creating an authentic secondary&#13;
market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
estimates that in 1980/81, only 6.8Z of financial savings of the household&#13;
sector were directly mobilized by the corporate sector either as securities&#13;
or company deposits. It can therefore be assumed that there exists a size-&#13;
able growth potential in the Indian capital market which will be tapped only&#13;
by (a) improving the attractiveness of the instruments to the savers,&#13;
(b) reducing the costs of intermediation and of floating of new issues,&#13;
(c) strengthening the infrastructure of the capital market, encouraging the&#13;
development of a secondary market, and (d) improving productivity and finan-&#13;
cial performance of the corporate sector itself. The Study Group lists&#13;
various measures aimed at achieving this objective which, if implemented,&#13;
would go a long way in widening the base of the capital market.&#13;

1.63    In the same vein, the Mehta/Honavar study 1/ also made several&#13;
recommendations on policy and organizational changes which would increase&#13;
the attractiveness of the capital markets to both savers and corporations.&#13;
The main recommendations are: (a) simplify procedures for transfer of shares&#13;
and reduce time spent between purchase and actual transfer of stock,&#13;
(b) develop a secondary market for debentures, (c) authorize buy back&#13;
arrangements of certain percentage of the debentures issue (since&#13;
implemented), (d) allow banks to invest a portion of their statutory&#13;
liquidity reserves on securities issued by private companies and not only in&#13;
approved Government securities.&#13;
1.64    What is not very clear is whether further increases in the capital&#13;
market will result in a diversion of funds from the banking system to capi-&#13;
tal market instruments or whether the effect will be to increase financial&#13;

savings relative to saving through physical asset formation. The design and&#13;
implementation of policy changes would be very much related to this&#13;
question. The ideal policy should allow a shift from tangible to financial&#13;
assets since this would facilitate a more efficient allocation of savings&#13;
between competing uses by subjecting them to the discipline of the money and&#13;
capital market. Funds could then be channeled into the most productive&#13;
uses. Policy changes should further aim at increasing the returns to&#13;
financial assets relative to physical assets and at reducing their invest-&#13;
ment risk. In addition, policies which affect returns on financial assets&#13;
should allow the growth of all different types of financial assets.&#13;
1.65    However, currently investors prefer deposits or are forced to invest&#13;
in approved securities rather than in typical capital market instruments.&#13;
Several measures could be taken to accelerate the development of the capital&#13;
market such as those mentioned above plus: (a) changing tax policies which&#13;
now make it more attractive for firms to borrow than issue equity;&#13;
(b) reducing the cost of capital issues which is estimated at about 7% of&#13;
the total issue; 1/ (c) amending legislation of Provident Funds to allow a&#13;
proportion of them to flow into corporate securities; (d) reviewing tax&#13;
exemption policies to provide appropriate incentives among different types&#13;
of financial assets.&#13;
1.66    Following this line of argument, the recent Rangarajan Study Group&#13;
Report highlighted the existing bias against equities as compared to low&#13;
risk assets like bank deposits and UTI units which enjoy a deduction under&#13;
Section 80L of the Income Tax Act. It also indicated that the bias against&#13;
equities could be neutralized by exempting dividend income from taxation on&#13;
a similar basis as that enjoyed by interest on deposits and income from UTI&#13;
units.2/&#13;
1/ The cost of raising capital on the market in some cases has reached&#13;
20% or more of the issue amount. The items responsible for the high&#13;
issue costs are expenses on advertising, conferences, printing and&#13;
supply of issue stationary, conveyance and foreign tours. Other costs&#13;
are subject to statutory ceilings such as underwriting commission (3%)&#13;
and brokerage fees (1.25%). Strong competition among merchant bankers&#13;
have reduced management fees to about 0.5% of the issue amount.&#13;
2/ The 1983/84 Budget removed the bias towards bank deposits by cancell-&#13;
ing the exemption for income tax purposes.&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
MACROECONOMIC DIMENSIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM&#13;
A. EVOLUTION OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM: ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS INDICATORS&#13;
2.1     This section presents information on the size, growth and composi-&#13;
tion of assets of financial institutions for the period 1950 through 1980.&#13;
The eleven most important types of financial institutions--RBI, commercial&#13;
banks, cooperative banks, post office savings system, development banks,&#13;
ARDC (NABARD), Unit Trust of India, Provident Funds, life insurance&#13;
companies, finance companies and other insurance companies--are differen-&#13;
tiated in Table 2.1.&#13;
2.2     There are various indicators which can be used to describe the&#13;
evolution of the financial system. Here we will first look at the growth&#13;
and composition of assets of the financial system itself, and then we will&#13;
analyze the evolution of the financial assets in the economy and will com-&#13;
pare with similar data for other countries.&#13;
2.3     The assets of financial institutions (deflated by the CDP deflator)&#13;
grew by 7.22% per annum in the 30-year period between 1950 and 1980, as&#13;
compared to the growth of CDP of only 3.7%. Growth was not uniform&#13;
throughout the period, fluctuating between 4.5% per annum in 1960-65 and&#13;
10.7% in 1975-80. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a strong cor-&#13;
relation between the growth of assets of financial institutions and that of&#13;
GDP. Another interesting fact that emerges from the figures is that in the&#13;
period since 1968, characterized by tighter government control of the finan-&#13;
cial system, particularly of commercial banks, the system grew by 8.5% per&#13;
annum, faster than the long-term growth rate of 7.2%. This occurred&#13;
primarily because of expansion of the banking system into rural areas and&#13;
increase in branches. The data show the increased "financialization" of the&#13;
Indian economy and suggest that an increased role of the public sector on&#13;
the financial system does not necessarily retard its development. These&#13;
trends are depicted in Chart 2.1.&#13;

2.4     The ratio of assets of financial institutions to GDP has increased&#13;
gradually from 38X in 1950 to 73X in 1975, then quickly to 103% by 1980,&#13;
marking an extensive financial deepening of the economy. The driving force&#13;
behind this increase has been the significant increase in the assets of the&#13;
commercial banks since the late 1960s as a consequence of: (a) the policy&#13;
of social control and nationalization of the major commercial banks which&#13;
widened the scope of the commercial banks to increase their exposure in&#13;
rural areas and in other previously unbanked regions; and (b) the sig-&#13;
nificant increase in foreign private remittances during the second half of&#13;
the 1970s (please refer to footnote on page 58). The introduction of the&#13;
Lead Bank scheme 1/ and the development of regional rural banks have also&#13;
1/ The Lead Bank scheme was introduced in 1969 with the dual objectives&#13;
of mobilizing deposits on a massive scale and of stepping up lending to&#13;
weak sectors of the economy. Under the scheme individual scheduled&#13;
banks are entrusted with the responsibility of locating growth centers,&#13;
assessing deposit potential and identifying credit gaps in specific&#13;
regions; and in concert with other banks and credit agencies operating&#13;
in those regions to evolve a coordinated program of credit deployment&#13;
for each district.&#13;

been major forces in the rapid increase of deposits in commercial banks.&#13;
There has been a reversal of the 1950-1965 trend of relative decline in the&#13;
importance of commercial banks in the financial system and as a consequence&#13;
the share of commercial banking in the total assets of the financial system&#13;
increased from 29.9% in 1965 to 44.2% in 1980. The emergence of new finan-&#13;
cial intermediaries such as development banks, a large number of cooperative&#13;
banks, the Unit Trust of India, and others, has also been a key factor in&#13;
the growth of the financial system.&#13;

2.5     Other development in the financial system which may account for part&#13;
of the increase in the share of financial assets to GDP is the "layering&#13;
effect" which occurs when the transfer of funds from the saver to the&#13;
ultimate borrower is not direct but takes place through one or several&#13;
financial intermediaries which relend the money, thus creating a duplication&#13;
of financial claims. The pyramidal structure of the Indian financial system&#13;
makes it suitable for financial layering. The three-tier structure of&#13;
government administration at the Center, State and local levels and&#13;
similarly that of cooperative institutions are suitable illustrations in&#13;
this context. In India's agriculture sector, the active primary agricul-&#13;
tural credit societies (PACSs) borrow funds from central cooperative banks&#13;
(CCBs) which themselves borrow part of their funds from State cooperative&#13;
banks (SCBs). In turn, the SCBs raise funds from refinancing facilities of&#13;
the NABARD which is financed by the Reserve Bank and the Indian Government.&#13;
The "layering effect" is the result of the percolation of finance from the&#13;
apex to lower level and inflates the total magnitude of flows.&#13;
2.6     This effect can be measured by the layering ratio, which is defined&#13;
as the proportion of inter-institutional issues among financial institutions&#13;
to the issues to non-financial sectors. There are not recent estimates of&#13;
this ratio for India. The most recent data available placed the layering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
ratio at 0.28 in 1970/71 indicating the increasing importance of intra-&#13;
financial claims.l/ Netting out layering would slow down the growth of the&#13;
financial system but in the absence of more detailed information on intra-&#13;
financial flows it is not possible to specify the extent of the reduction.&#13;
2.7     This rapid growth of the financial system, both in real terms and as&#13;
a proportion of GDP, also witnesses to its success in providing financial&#13;
assets sufficiently attractive to compete with holdings of physical capital,&#13;
such as precious metals and real estate, as stores of wealth. Despite this&#13;
significant financial deepening, there is still substantial scope for&#13;
improvement since financial savings still account for only about 30% of&#13;
total savings in the economy.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT RATIOS&#13;
2.8     The data presented earlier showed the significant "financialization"&#13;
of the Indian economy which occurred since 1950/51. The financial develop-&#13;
ment of a country can also be measured by the following ratios: (a) the&#13;
Finance Ratio, which indicates the relationship between financial develop-&#13;
ment and economic development and is measured by the ratio of total finan-&#13;
cial claims to national income; (b) the Financial Interrelations Ratio which&#13;
establishes the relationship between the financial system and the funding of&#13;
investment and is measured by the ratio of total financial claims to net&#13;
physical capital formation; (c) the New Issue Ratio is an indicator of the&#13;
extent to which the non-financial sector directly finances investment as&#13;
measured by the ratio of primary issues (those claims created by non-&#13;
financial sectors) to net physical capital formation; and (d) the&#13;
Intermediation Ratio which indicates the proportion of financial transac-&#13;
tions in the economy which take place through financial institutions. It is&#13;
usually measured as the proportion of claims issued by financial institu-&#13;
tions to the issues of non-financial sectors. Here it is measured as the&#13;
ratio of issues of financial institutions to total financial issues to&#13;
clarify its meaning. Trends in these ratios are shown in Table 2.3.&#13;

2.9     The Finance Ratio increased from 4.9Z in 1951-56 to 14.1% in 1961-66&#13;
and 26.9% in 1977-81, clearly indicating the increasing role and importance&#13;
of the financial superstructure in the Indian economy since independence.l/&#13;
In 1977-81, financial claims in the economy amounted to over one-fourth of&#13;
national income, compared to just about one-twentieth during the First Plan&#13;
period. The evolution of this ratio supports earlier figures presented on&#13;
the growth of the assets of the financial system and of the increasing role&#13;
of financial assets in household savings.&#13;
2.10    The evolution of the Financial Interrelations ratio (FIR) also&#13;
points out the increasing role of the financial system in channeling funds&#13;
in the economy. The FIR shows an upward trend almost throughout the whole&#13;
period between 1951/52 and 1980/81. The FIR has been above unity since&#13;
1969-74 indicating that the growth in financial claims issued was higher&#13;
than the growth in investment. The performance of this ratio reflects the&#13;
increasing role of the financial system in mobilizing surplus funds avail-&#13;
able in the economy and allocating them among the needy sectors. In short,&#13;
it is an indicator of the larger role played by financial institutions in&#13;
mobilizing funds for economic development.&#13;
2.11    The New Issues ratio, indicative of the extent to which the non-&#13;
financial sectors directly financed investment, also shows a rising trend&#13;
over the years. The ratio jumped from 0.46 in 1951-56 to 0.87 in 1977-81.&#13;
Other important financial ratio is the Intermediation ratio which indicates&#13;
the relative importance of the claims issued by financial and non-financial&#13;
institutions. This ratio, also defined as secondary issues to total issues,&#13;
1/ The finance ratio relates to financial flows and national income while&#13;
the ratio of assets of financial institutions toGDP shown in Table 2.3&#13;
is measured based in stock figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
showed that the proportion of claims issued by financial institutions to&#13;
total claims increased from 0.27 in 1951-56 to 0.44 in 1969-74, indicating&#13;
an increase in the importance of indirect financing in the Indian economy.&#13;
The shift to higher levels of indirect financing and thus to a higher degree&#13;
of intermediation through financial institutions is typical of the develop-&#13;
ing phase of less developed countries. The slight decline in the inter-&#13;
mediation ratio since 1974 reflects a higher utilization of direct financing&#13;
by non-financial sectors in the last few years, particularly by the&#13;
Government which has stepped up the issuing of securities to tap household&#13;
sector savings directly.&#13;
2.12    In summary, the evolution of the financial ratios follow trends&#13;
which are to be expected in developing countries: an increase in the impor-&#13;
tance of financial institutions in the economy and of financial flows in&#13;
relation to economic activity, thus reflecting the fact that the financial&#13;
system has increasingly facilitated the transfer of funds from the surplus&#13;
to the deficit sectors. This transfer is effected either by direct claims&#13;
issued by non-financial deficit sectors or indirectly through financial&#13;
intermediaries, both of which have grown considerably in India. The expan-&#13;
sion of financial assets can be attributed to the expanding role of the&#13;
public sector investment and the active role of the financial institutions&#13;
in widening and deepening the financial system in terms of the range of&#13;
financial instruments and magnitude of funds traded.&#13;
C. FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
2.13    Table 2.4 presents data on the evolution of the financial balances&#13;
of major sectors in the Indian economy presented as a percentage of GDP.&#13;
Households and Rest of the World (ROW) are the main surplus sectors financ-&#13;
ing the Government and Private Corporate Business (PCB) which are the main&#13;
deficit sectors. These two deficit sectors complement their investment&#13;
requirements by direct borrowing from Households and ROW and indirectly&#13;
through financial intermediation.&#13;
2.14    In the period 1970/71 to 1980/81, the Household sector was the only&#13;
surplus sector in the domestic economy since ROW, traditionally a surplus&#13;
sector, recorded deficits. In several years during this period, capital&#13;
account transactions on balance of payments effected between resident units&#13;
and non-resident units, including the international organizations, were&#13;
unfavorable. The financial deficit of the Government increased from 1.8% of&#13;
GDP in 1951-56 to 4.4Z in 1961-66 and 6.7% in 1977-81. Similarly, the&#13;
deficit of the Private Corporate Sector also increased from 0.8% of GDP in&#13;
1951-56 to 1.6% in 1961-66 and 1.7% in 1977-81. These deficits were mostly&#13;
financed by the Household Sector which recorded very high levels of finan-&#13;
cial surplus in the 1970s (4.8% in 1970-77 and 7.4% in 1977-81), and lent to&#13;
banking, other financial institutions, Government and Private Corporate&#13;
Business sectors in the form of currency and deposits, contractual savings&#13;
(insurance and provident funds), small savings and trade debt.&#13;

2.15    Table 2.5 shows the flow of funds by major type of instrument for&#13;
selected sectors and periods. The structure of sources of funds for the two&#13;
largest deficit sectors (Government and Private Corporate Business) is&#13;
shown, as well as that of uses of funds of the Household Sector. Throughout&#13;
the years, a large proportion of sources of funds for the Government was&#13;
provided by Treasury Bills, other securities and loans and advances. The&#13;
mix, however, fluctuated between periods, with some periods in which borrow-&#13;
ings from financial institutions were considerable and others in which&#13;
financing by issuing Treasury Bills and other securities was predominant.&#13;
Small savings and Provident Funds have also been a steady, although not very&#13;
large, source of funding for the Government. In the case of the Private&#13;
Corporate Sector, borrowings from financial institutions constitute the&#13;
single most important source of finance which fluctuated between 84.5% in&#13;
1966-70 and 49.5% in 1970-74. The data also shows the decline in paid-up&#13;
capital as a source of funds and that of debentures (although it improved&#13;
somewhat in 1977-81 and has continued to improve since then). During the&#13;
1970s, trade credit was also an important source of fund for the private&#13;
corporate sector. An interesting development in the early 1980s has been&#13;
the increase in the proportion of corporate securities in the total sources&#13;
of funds for private corporate business. In 1981-83 corporate securities&#13;
accounted for 8.4% of funds for private business, significantly higher than&#13;
levels experienced in the 1970s.&#13;

2.16    The Household sector deploys its loanable funds by holding the&#13;
primary issues of non-financial sectors or the secondary issues of financial&#13;
institutions. The bulk of the Households' financial surpluses are kept with&#13;
banks and other financial institutions and such placements have steadily&#13;
grown both relatively and in absolute terms. Important shares of the&#13;
surpluses are also maintained as cash (presumably mostly for transaction&#13;
purposes) and provident funds. Lower shares are invested in Government&#13;

ments have probably occurred in 1981-83 due to higher yields and lower&#13;
inflation rates. Direct financing from Households to Government and Private&#13;
Corporate Sector accounts for only about 11% and 13% respectively of their&#13;
total sources of funds, the balance being provided by ROW and the financial&#13;
system through loans and advances or investment in securities. This is&#13;
consistent with a larger role of the financial sector in the mobilization of&#13;
funds in the Indian economy which has been indicated in earlier paragraphs.&#13;
D. ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE MOBILIZATION OF SAVINGS&#13;
2.17    Savings Trends.   Since the mid-seventies, the Indian economy has&#13;
experienced very high saving rates relative to its low per capita income.&#13;
India's saving rates are high in comparison to other low-income countries&#13;
and are more comparable with those of middle income countries. There has&#13;
been an almost continual increase in the saving rate, which averaged 15.6%&#13;
in 1965-70, 20.5% in 1970-80, and 22.6% in 1980-83. The acceleration and&#13;
maintenance of the savings rate at relatively high levels has been closely&#13;
linked with income growth--the elasticity of gross domestic savings with&#13;
respect to real income exceeds 2.0. The increase in the proportion of net&#13;
disposable income to net domestic product partly explains the rising saving&#13;
rate, but other factors have contributed as well, including the significant&#13;
financial deepening of the Indian economy since Independence, and in the&#13;
second half of the 1970s, the strong growth in production (especially in&#13;
agriculture) and the significant increase in workers' remittances. The&#13;
increasing share of the secondary and tertiary sectors in the Indian NDP,&#13;
which have higher marginal propensities to save, was also an important&#13;
factor.&#13;
2.18    The Household sector, which comprises, not only individuals, but&#13;
also all non-Governmental and non-corporate enterprises such as sole&#13;
proprietorships, partnerships, and such non-profit organizations as&#13;
charitable and educational institutions and trusts account for over three-&#13;
fourths of the net savings in the economy. The share of household savings&#13;
on net savings has not declined while India's savings rate has increased,&#13;
indicating that this high savings scenario is primarily related to higher&#13;
household savings. About 80% of the increase in the savings rate in the&#13;
period between 1970/71 and 1978/79 has been due to higher household savings.&#13;
Savings of the household sector accounted for 13.9% of net domestic product&#13;
(NDP) in 1980/81, up from 5.2% in 1950/51, 6.3% in 1960/61 and 9.3% in&#13;
1970/71.  Savings in the form of both financial and physical assets have&#13;
increased, however the increase has been more marked in the case of finan-&#13;
cial savings which now account for 7.2% of NDP, compared to 0.7% in 1950/51.&#13;
Therefore, higher saving rates in the Indian economy since the mid-seventies&#13;
have been accompanied by higher levels of financial savings.&#13;

2.19    The major causal force in the increase in net financial savings of&#13;
the household sector has been the increased role of financial institutions&#13;
in the Indian economy. This process started in the early 1950s, but&#13;
accelerated after 1968 with the nationalization of most of the banking&#13;
system followed by the introduction of the Lead Bank scheme and regional&#13;
rural banks. This brought about a tremendous expansion in banking services&#13;
by opening branches in previously unbanked rural and urban areas. Other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
factors spurring the growth in financial savings, particularly during the&#13;
1970s, were: (a) the significant increase in foreign remittances; (b) the&#13;
increased real return to savings due to the combined effect of higher inter-&#13;
est rates and general price stability that characterized the period 1975-79;&#13;
(c) the growing monetization and commercialization of the economy; and&#13;
(d) the increase in household income due to economic development.&#13;
2.20    The household sector's saving pattern is better understood by a&#13;
financial instrument-wise analysis of the flow of its savings. This disag-&#13;
gregation facilitates the task of explaining the reasons behind the increase&#13;
in financial savings. The evolution of the structure of financial savings&#13;
by main instruments is depicted in Table 2.8.&#13;

2.21    One part of household savings is held in the form of currency to&#13;
satisfy households' demand for liquidity due to transactional, speculative&#13;
and precautionary motives. However, the single largest form of financial&#13;
assets held by the household sector since the early seventies is saving in&#13;
the form of deposits, of which more than three-fourths are deposits with&#13;
commercial banks (as will be documented later). Other significant forms of&#13;
savings are accretions to Life Insurance funds and provident funds, although&#13;
they now constitute a smaller proportion of household savings in comparison&#13;
to earlier years. The claims on government are another form of household&#13;
saving and their major components are accruals under small savings, special&#13;
bearer bonds, compulsory deposit schemes and direct investment in Government&#13;
securities. The remaining savings of the household sector are in the form&#13;
of investments in shares and debentures, in units of the Unit Trust of India&#13;
and trade credit extended by the household sector to the corporate sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
2.22    There has been a significant change in the composition of financial&#13;
savings since the 1950s. The financial instrument which has shown the&#13;
largest increase in its share as a component of financial savings of the&#13;
household sector has been net deposits, which include deposits in commercial&#13;
banks, other financial institutions and in non-financial institutions&#13;
(including company deposits). The factors behind the increase in net&#13;
deposits are: (a) the deepening of the financial system due to the intro-&#13;
duction of the Lead Bank scheme and Regional Rural Banks which opened&#13;
branches in areas of the country which were previously unbanked, thereby&#13;
expanding the financial infrastructure; (b) the significant increase in&#13;
foreign remittances, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total&#13;
financial savings, which occurred particularly since the mid-seventies;l/&#13;
and (c) the increase in interest rates to arrest severe competition from&#13;
alternative saving instruments. In the absence of details on the uses of&#13;
foreign remittances, it is not possible to determine precisely the extent to&#13;
which incoming remittances are converted into financial savings or are put&#13;
to alternative uses. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to assume, as the Raj&#13;
Committee Report on Savings did,2/ that at least initially, foreign remit-&#13;
tances would get reflected almost entirely in an increase in household&#13;
financial savings, particularly in the form of currency and bank deposits.&#13;
Net deposits constitute the largest type of financial asset held by the&#13;
household sector. Table 2.10 disaggregates total deposits by major&#13;
components: commercial bank deposits, cooperative bank deposits and company&#13;
deposits.&#13;
2.23    The share of deposits on commercial banks to total deposits out-&#13;
standing has remained at about 83%-84% throughout the 1970s, indicating that&#13;
the bulk of the increase in financial savings which occurred during the&#13;
period has been directed to commercial banks. Deposits in cooperative&#13;
banks, also part of the public sector institutional machinery, make up for&#13;
7.8% of total deposits, down from 9% in 1970/71. The decline in deposits&#13;
in cooperative banks has been offset by an increase in the share of company&#13;
deposits.3/ Although only small amounts flow to the private corporate&#13;
sector in the form of direct company deposits, they increased by a healthy&#13;
31% in 1979/80 and 21% in 1980/81, faster than bank deposits. These company&#13;
deposits flow to both financial and non-financial companies. The proportion&#13;
of deposits flowing to non-financial companies (mainly large industrial&#13;
firms) fluctuated between 4.8% and 5.9% in the seventies. It is interesting&#13;
1/ Foreign remittances increased from Rs 1.4 billion in 1973/74 to Rs&#13;
21.3 billion in 1980/81. In the same period, foreign remittances as a&#13;
proportion of gross financial savings and Bank deposits increased from&#13;
3.9% to 18.2% and from 9.4% to 39.6%, respectively.&#13;

2.24    The importance of claims on Government in financial savings also&#13;
has increased since the mid-seventies. This came about because the&#13;
Government had to borrow additional resources from the public and had to tap&#13;
a larger proportion of household savings in order to finance higher invest-&#13;
ment expenditures and Government deficits. These moves explain the increase&#13;
in the share of gross claims on Government in the total financial assets of&#13;
the household sector to 4.9% in 1975-80 and 3.7% in 1980/81.&#13;
2.25    The Government effected this increase in a series of measures.&#13;
First, the increase in the households "claims on Government" was due to the&#13;
introduction of securities offering higher returns, such as a new six-year&#13;
national savings certificate (1981), and a more aggressive effort in col-&#13;
lecting "small savings" by the Postal Savings Bank, which was allowed to&#13;
increase the interest rate on five-year Post Office time deposits from 10.5%&#13;
to 11.5% in March 1983. Second, to encourage the absorption in the finan-&#13;
cial system of illegal funds circulating in parallel channels, ten-year&#13;
Special Bearer Bonds (SBBs) with an annual interest rate of 2% were offered&#13;
in 1981. Total subscriptions to SBBs amounted to Rs 9.6 billion; the amount&#13;
purchased by the household sector was equivalent to about 6%-7% of new gross&#13;
financial savings. Third, the Government also introduced National Savings&#13;
Certificates (NSCs) in 1981/82 with the attractive terms of 12% interest and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
six years maturity. The share of NSCs rose from 2% of household financial&#13;
savings in 1980/81 to 4.6% in 1981/82. Fourth, in 1982/83 the Government&#13;
introduced two long-term bonds, Capital Investment Bonds and Social Security&#13;
Certificates; but the public response to these instruments has not been as&#13;
strong as for NSCs. Despite this recent increase in net claims on the&#13;
Government, it is quite clear that the Government has been unable to secure&#13;
a major share of the increase in financial savings directly. Financial&#13;
mediation through banks, other financial institutions, Life Insurance Funds&#13;
and Provident Funds played an important role in the transfer of household&#13;
financial savings into public sector spending.&#13;
2.26    The data on Table 2.8 also indicate a decline in the importance of&#13;
shares and debentures to total financial assets of the household sector&#13;
during the 1970s as compared with the 1950s and 1960s. The issuing of&#13;
shares and debentures as a source of corporate funding declined as a conse-&#13;
quence of a larger reliance on company deposits and on funds from financial&#13;
institutions to finance operations. The revival of company deposits is&#13;
explained by the large spread between bank borrowing and lending rates which&#13;
allow companies with good financial records to take deposits directly from&#13;
the public by paying higher returns than banks and still reduce their cost&#13;
of funds. The recent difficulty of obtaining sufficient funds directly from&#13;
the financial institutions in a timely manner, due to reduced availability&#13;
and cumbersome procedures, is also behind this larger use of company&#13;
deposits.&#13;
2.27    As was already stated in Section G of Chapter I, capital market&#13;
activity has increased since 1980, encouraged by recent Government policy&#13;
measures, such as allowing industrial firms to raise their debt-equity ratio&#13;
to 2:1, increases in the rate of interest of convertible and non-convertible&#13;
debentures, authorization to include buy-back clauses on issues of non-&#13;
convertible debentures, and new measures to attract investments by non-&#13;
resident Indians (Table 1.6). Despite this increase in capital market&#13;
activity, its contribution to private corporate sector resources is small&#13;
when compared with household financial savings or the sector's needs. The&#13;
sizable growth potential in the Indian capital market will only be tapped&#13;
by: (a) improving the attractiveness of the instruments, (b) reducing the&#13;
cost of intermediation and of floating of new issues, (c) strengthening the&#13;
infrastructure of the capital market, (d) encouraging the development of a&#13;
secondary market, and perhaps most important (e) improving the productivity&#13;
and financial performance of the corporate sector itself. As in the case of&#13;
the public sector, the private corporate sector has also relied very heavily&#13;
on financial mediation to make use of larger household financial savings&#13;
available.&#13;
2.28    Households have been very conservative in choosing financial assets.&#13;
They have preferred the financial instruments issued by the Government&#13;
(national saving certificates, post office savings schemes, other small&#13;
savings deposits, and to a lesser degree, securities), banking and other&#13;
financial institutions to shares, debentures and company deposit schemes of&#13;
the private corporate sector. The reason for this is that the public is&#13;
very averse to risks. The ineffectiveness of the stock exchanges in&#13;
providing an active market for a large number of corporate securities and&#13;
the overall poor performance of industry contribute to this lack of interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
in investment in industrial securities. Furthermore, it appears that the&#13;
household sector prefers to hold its savings in the form of financial assets&#13;
which: (a) are relatively liquid; (b) have low transaction costs; (c) are&#13;
simple to understand; and (d) earn a return comparable to that on private&#13;
lending, which involves high transaction costs and is not very liquid.&#13;
2.29    A large proportion of savings has gone to bank deposits because they&#13;
offer returns that are higher than those of Government and industrial&#13;
securities. Industrial securities do not offer yields high enough to&#13;
compensate for the risks involved in comparison to Government securities or&#13;
bank deposits. Another reason for the small development of the stock&#13;
markets relates to the low number of issues that are available to the&#13;
investors, since only a small number of cmpanies list their stocks in the&#13;
markets. The private corporate sector has to improve its profitability in&#13;
order to offer higher returns and sufficient capital appreciations and&#13;
encourage investors to hold its financial instruments. At present only a&#13;
small number of well-known profitable companies are successful in placing&#13;
their securities in the market. The securities market mobilizes only a&#13;
small part of the household sector's financial savings, the major part being&#13;
mobilized by the banking system, social security institutions and pension&#13;
funds.&#13;

E. INTER-COUNTRY COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM DEPTH&#13;
2.30    An estimate of financial assets outstanding is also provided by the&#13;
sum of broad money and total securities outstanding (public and private&#13;
sector issues). This measure of financial system development is a better&#13;
gauge for inter-country comparisons because it is based on aggregate&#13;
monetary statistics which tend to be more accurate and uniform. On the&#13;
contrary, the aggregation of financial assets as done in Table 2.1 is more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
cumbersome. Since country data and definitions are not entirely consistent,&#13;
the figures presented in Table 2.11 are only illustrative of relative&#13;
degrees of financial system depth.&#13;
2.31    The data show that India's financial development compares favorably&#13;
with those of other developing countries, including some upper middle income&#13;
developing countries. The following are some of the factors which may&#13;
account for India's "deeper" financial system: (a) an inflation rate lower&#13;
than that of other developing countries which have eased the task of&#13;
providing adequate returns thus discouraging asset holders to shift from&#13;
financial assets into physical assets; (b) a large proportion of Government&#13;
finance which flows through the financial system (the Government utilizes&#13;
provident funds, small savings and about one-third of commercial bank&#13;
deposits almost directly to finance its expenditures and in addition it&#13;
borrows from the financial system and issues securities); (c) a financial&#13;
system which allows only a very small number of activities to foreign banks&#13;
thereby increasing financial intermediation through domestic financial&#13;
institutions; and (d) large forced savings programs, such as provident&#13;
funds.&#13;

2.32    Another interesting area for international comparison is the&#13;
development of the securities market. Table 2.12 shows data on the share&#13;
of the securities markets in GNP for selected countries including India.&#13;
The data indicate that India's capital markets are very underdeveloped when&#13;
compared to those in other lower and lower middle income developing&#13;
countries. The comparison with upper middle income developing countries is&#13;
even less favorable. This proves that there is a tremendous potential in&#13;
India to develop and widen the capital markets. This will probably require&#13;
some major changes in regulation (paragraphs 1.62 and 1.63). Increased&#13;
capital market activity is important because it would increase competition&#13;
in the financial system and bring additional resources for corporate&#13;
investment.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
CREDIT ALLOCATION&#13;
A. COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE&#13;
3.1     Table 3.1 presents a comprehensive picture of credit outstanding by&#13;
major type of financial institution and economic sector as of 1982. At the&#13;
aggregate level, commercial banks account for the largest share of total&#13;
credit outstanding (47.9%), followed by cooperative credit societies (14.2%)&#13;
and Life Insurance Corporation (6.6%). With regards to the sectoral alloca-&#13;
tions of credit, 37.0% of all credit outstanding was given to industry&#13;
(excluding power), 20.8% to agriculture and 12.3% to trade activities.&#13;
3.2     The data also indicates the relative importance of the various&#13;
financial institutions in individual borrower sectors. For instance, in the&#13;
case of industry, credit from commercial banks account for 63.0% of total&#13;
credit outstanding, while the share of the three all-India development banks&#13;
(IDBI, IFCI, ICICI) amounted only to about 12% and that of SFCs and SIDCs to&#13;
about 7.2%. These institutions (ICICI, IDBI, IFCI, SFCs, SIDCs), together&#13;
with LIC and UTI still provide the bulk of term financing for industry since&#13;
only about 14% of commercial bank credit to industry is provided as term&#13;
loans.l/&#13;
3.3     In the case of agriculture, commercial banks are also the most&#13;
important institutions providing credit. Commercial banks account for 35.5%&#13;
of credit outstanding to agriculture as compared to 21.4% and 14.4% provided&#13;
by cooperative credit societies and land development banks, respectively.&#13;
NABARD accounted for 15.5%.&#13;
3.4     Unfortunately, comparable data is not available for previous years&#13;
and therefore it is not possible to analyze trends in the overall lending&#13;
operations of the system. This can however be done for scheduled commercial&#13;
banks which account for the largest share of total credit outstanding&#13;
(50.2%) and which lend to almost all economic sectors.&#13;
B. DEPLOYMENT OF CREDIT BY SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS&#13;
3.5     The pattern of bank credit changed substantially over the last&#13;
fifteen years as a consequence of: (a) the nationalization of major commer-&#13;
cial banks in 1969; (b) larger borrowing by the public sector; (c) larger&#13;
proportion of food procurement being financed by commercial banks; and (d)&#13;
efforts to increase lending to priority sectors and under-privileged and&#13;
1/ Term financing to industry by commercial banks is probably larger&#13;
since the 14% figure does not include rollovers.&#13;

neglected sectors. Table 3.2 contains data on the composition of credit&#13;
deployment by sector for selected years between 1968 and 1983. The data&#13;
reveal an almost steady increase in the share of priority sector lending.l/&#13;
Priority sector lending on aggregate accounted for 35.7% of gross bank&#13;
credit as of March 1983, compared to 14.0% in June 1969. Banks were ini-&#13;
tially asked to ensure that the total lending to priority sectors should&#13;
reach a level of not less than one-third of total outstanding credit by&#13;
March 1979. More recently, the Government has set a target that by 1985,&#13;
40% of bank credit should be channelized to priority sectors. Based on past&#13;
trends, it appears that the target will be met. In addition to the overall&#13;
target of lending to priority sectors, a sub-target has been made for lend-&#13;
ing to agriculture which should be extended at least 40% of the advances to&#13;
priority sector. This would mean that the agricultural sector would receive&#13;
at least 16% of total advances by 1985. Another important target is that&#13;
the ratio of credits to deposits of rural and semi-urban branches of banks&#13;
should be not less than 60%.&#13;
3.6     Of the total amount of credit extended to the priority sectors,&#13;
outstanding as of March 1983, agriculture and small-scale industries&#13;
received 42.9% and 36.4% respectively, the balance being allocated to the&#13;
other priority sectors such as, road and water transport operations, retail&#13;
trade and small business, professional and self-employed persons, and&#13;
education. The rise in the share of priority sector lending over the years&#13;
brought about a reduction in the relative shares of wholesale trade (other&#13;
than for food procurement) and of medium and large industries. This gradual&#13;
process of shift in sectoral distribution of credit represents the success&#13;
of Government policies directed at structural changes in the composition of&#13;
bank credit to make it available to sectors previously not able to borrow&#13;
from the commercial banking system.&#13;
1/ At present, priority sectors broadly include: (a) agriculture;&#13;
(b) small scale industry; (c) industrial estates; (d) road and water&#13;
transport operators; (e) retail trade and small businesses;&#13;
(f) professionals and self-employed persons; (g) education; and&#13;

3.7     An important question is whether the expansion of priority sector&#13;
lending significantly distorts the allocation of credit, reducing its&#13;
availability to more productive activities, particularly for medium and&#13;
large industry in the private sector. Table 3.3 shows trends in the ratios&#13;
of bank credit to industry to gross domestic capital formation of manufac-&#13;
turing and of bank borrowings of medium and large public limited companies&#13;
to their inventories for selected years between 1960/61 and 1978/79.&#13;
Although such data do not allow one to conclude whether or not bank funds&#13;
were sufficient, they do allow one to compare the situations before and&#13;
after the expansion of priority sector lending. With regard to bank credit&#13;
to industry, the data do not show any significant difference in the propor-&#13;
tion of gross domestic capital formation financed by the banking system&#13;
before and after the expansion of priority sector lending, thereby suggest-&#13;
ing that industry does not seem to have been significantly affected by the&#13;
introduction of the new policy. This is partially due to the fact that&#13;
small-scale industry is considered priority. Nevertheless, the data for&#13;
medium and large public limited companies also indicate that, excluding the&#13;
period 1967/68-1969/70, there is no major difference in the proportion of&#13;
bank borrowings to inventories before and after the expansion. The increase&#13;
in the proportion of Bank borrowing going to finance inventories of large&#13;
borrowers such as that in 1967-70 was one of the reasons to tighten the&#13;
requirements of the credit authorization scheme (CAS).&#13;

3.8     Although further work on this area is required, the partial data&#13;
available suggest that the expansion of credit to priority sectors while&#13;
reducing the proportion of bank credit provided to medium and large industry&#13;
relative to total credit, has not significantly reduced the amount of real&#13;
credit available to the sub-sector from the banking sector. For instance,&#13;
Bank credit outstanding to medium and large industry grew by 5% p.a. in real&#13;
terms between March 1968 and June 1982 while the real GDP of registered&#13;
manufacturing increased by 4.2% p.a. during the 1970s. The substantial&#13;
increase in bank deposits during the 1970s made this possible by permitting&#13;
banks to continue servicing the needs of non-priority borrowers while&#13;
increasing their lending to priority sectors.l/ Nonetheless, during periods&#13;
1/ In 1980/81, bank deposits amounted to 31.6% of India's net domestic&#13;
product as compared with 15.5% in 1970/71 and 20.2% in 1975/76.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
of tight credit or slow deposit growth, credit to medium and large industry&#13;
can be significantly affected as credit to all borrowers is not distributed&#13;
proportionally. When faced with periods of tight credit, industry has&#13;
sought alternative sources of finance such as suppliers' credit, direct&#13;
deposit from the public and borrowing from the capital markets.&#13;
Nonetheless, these alternative sources of funds are limited and are&#13;
generally only available to the most successful companies. Since 1980&#13;
Indian private industry has been permitted to tap capital markets more&#13;
aggressively due to changes in Government policies which were described&#13;
earlier in the paper. However, the capital markets in India remain small&#13;
and further measures will be required in order to reduce rigidities which&#13;
hamper their development.&#13;
3.9     Data on trade credit to medium and large industry provided by small&#13;
industry also show increases during periods of tight credit. Therefore,&#13;
although Bank credit to medium and large industry may be restricted, these&#13;
industries are able to partially finance their needs by slowing payments to&#13;
ancillaries and other small-scale suppliers, a development which is itself&#13;
disruptive, thereby neutralizing the intended reduction in credit. Industry&#13;
has also supplemented its financing needs by accepting deposits from&#13;
households (also known as company deposits) and by borrowing from institu-&#13;
tional sources (IDBI, ICICI, SFCs, LIC, etc.) in a larger scale.&#13;
3.10    Table 3.4 presents data on the distribution of bank credit to&#13;
industry according to ownership. The data show that excluding 1981 when&#13;
large amounts of bank credit were channelled into the oil sector to finance&#13;
imports and exploration, the share of the public sector in total credit to&#13;
industry remained stable at about 10% since 1973. This finding contradicts&#13;
the general view of an apparent preference by the banks and RBI to finance&#13;
public sector industry at the expense of the private sector. Nonetheless,&#13;
the expansion of credit to the oil sector in 1981 was mostly accommodated&#13;
through a reduction of credit to private industry for working capital. More&#13;
recent data would be required to determine whether 1981 marks a departure&#13;
from the steady trend of the 1970s or if it just reflects a one-time change&#13;
in the trend resulting from efforts to adjust the Indian economy to the&#13;
second oil shock of 1979 as rapidly as possible.&#13;
3.11    Another emerging trend shown in Table 3.4 is the gradual reduction&#13;
in the share of industrial credit to private sector companies. This prob-&#13;
ably results from an increase in priority sector lending to small scale&#13;
industry, which is mostly reflected as credit to partnerships, proprietary&#13;
concerns, joint families and individuals.&#13;

C. DEPLOYMENT OF CREDIT BY TYPE OF OWNERSHIP&#13;
3.12    Another important change in credit deployment by commercial banks&#13;
since the nationalization of 1969 is the increase in the share of credit to&#13;
the public sector in relation to total credit. Credit outstanding to the&#13;
public sector increased from 13.4% in December 1972 to 29.5% in June 1977,&#13;
declining thereafter to 24% in June 1981 as shown in Table 3.5.1/ Credit to&#13;
the cooperative sector maintained its small relative importance (about 2% of&#13;
total credit), while the private sector, particularly companies, experienced&#13;
a significant reduction in its share. This highlights the increasing role&#13;
of the financial system, particularly the banking sector, in financing&#13;
public sector expenditures. In addition to providing credit to the&#13;
Government, the banking system invests a large proportion of funds (about&#13;
36% of total deposits) in Government and Government approved securities,&#13;
therefore a large proportion of commercial bank resources are channelled&#13;
into the public sector.&#13;
3.13     The data presented in Table 3.5 also show that the bulk of the&#13;
increase in public sector borrowing came from Central and State Government&#13;
undertakings, while the decline in the share of the private sector mostly&#13;
affected companies which experienced a reduction in their share of total&#13;
credit outstanding from 52.5% in 1972 to 36.0% in 1981. This reduction in&#13;
the share of private sector companies in total bank credit outstanding is a&#13;
consequence of: (a) meeting priority sector lending targets and&#13;
(b) enlarging the role of the banking system in financing expenditures of&#13;
public sector enterprises. The table also shows that the share of the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
public sector in total credit outstanding peaked at 29.5% in 1977 and has&#13;
declined thereafter, indicating a reversal of the trend observed in the&#13;
early 1970s. This development is welcome because it releases bank funds for&#13;
financing private sector investment and consumption.&#13;

D. TERM-STRUCTURE OF BANK CREDIT&#13;
3.14    Another important development in the Indian banking system during&#13;
the 1970s was the increase in the proportion of term lending to total credit&#13;
outstanding. In December 1980, 22.2% of total credit outstanding was term&#13;
lending as compared to 11.9% in December 1972. Data shown in Table 3.6&#13;
indicates that this trend is related to the expansion of priority sector&#13;
lending, a large proportion of which was made as term lending, even in 1972.&#13;
The data show that industry and trade, the two major non-priority sectors,&#13;
have the lowest percentages of term lending, 13.9% and 4.5%, respectively,&#13;
as compared to 63.4% for agriculture, 85% for transport operators and 54.8%&#13;
for personal loans. While the proportion of term lending by commercial&#13;
banks has increased considerably, this should not be regarded as an increase&#13;
in term transformation by the system because there has been a parallel&#13;
change in the structure of deposits. Time deposits as a proportion of total&#13;
deposits in commercial banks increased from 54.6% in 1969 to 81.3% in 1984.&#13;

E. CONCLUDING NOTES ON CREDIT DEPLOYMENT&#13;
3.15    The Indian Government intervenes extensively in the allocative&#13;
process both by directing the commercial banks to lend to priority sectors&#13;
and by establishing specialized institutions such as development banks to&#13;
make priority loans. It believes that without its intervention, some sec-&#13;
tors would receive less credit than indicated by social priorities, while&#13;
other sectors with lower priority would receive too much. While the inter-&#13;
vention has succeeded in diverting credit into desired channels, its impact&#13;
in terms of economic growth and efficiency in the use of resources is not&#13;
clear. There is a need for further studies to assess the impact of these&#13;
policies on economic efficiency and to determine its costs and benefits.&#13;
Such studies could also respond to the following questions with regards to&#13;
the efficiency of credit deployment: Do the banks lend enough in aggregate?&#13;
Do they allocate their credit appropriately between different sectors in the&#13;
economy? Do they lend enough to particular borrowers? Do the benefits of&#13;
credit allocation regulations exceed their costs in terms of refusal or&#13;
delays in granting credit for productive activities?&#13;
3.16    The comparison of credit shares allocated to specific sectors with&#13;
respect to their contributions to gross national product shows that the&#13;
shares of credit to priority sectors are, by and large, below their con-&#13;
tributions to production. For instance, agriculture contributes nearly 40%&#13;
of the gross national product through its share on total bank credit is only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
about 12%. However, this is a crude yardstick for assessing the efficiency&#13;
of credit allocation, and should not be used by itself to support the expan-&#13;
sion of priority sector lending. The important questions are whether the&#13;
funds given to priority sectors are being used productively or not, and&#13;
whether there are alternative non-priority activities with higher produc-&#13;
tivity that are not being financed.&#13;
3.17    The inclusion of any item in priority sector has two advantages,&#13;
(a) priority in allocation of credit; and (b) concessions in terms and&#13;
conditions (including interest rates). These advantages sometimes conflict&#13;
with the objectives of monetary policy.l/ Since priority sectors, food&#13;
procurement, exports, and some public sector activities are usually exempted&#13;
from higher lending rates and during periods of overall credit restraint&#13;
they do not seem to be affected by credit squeezes, the burden of adjustment&#13;
falls on other segments of the private sector such as medium and large&#13;
industry. In order to conduct effective monetary control while providing&#13;
adequate credit to all sectors during periods of credit restraint, measures&#13;
should be taken to spread the burden of adjustment as evenly as possible.&#13;
3.18    The analysis of credit deployment has shown a trend toward increased&#13;
bank exposure to priority sectors of the economy and at longer maturities.&#13;
This should be monitored very closely to avoid an escalation in the propor-&#13;
tion of overdue loans. For instance, there are reports on the low and&#13;
gradually deteriorating ratio of recovery to total credit with respect to&#13;
direct agricultural advances which may be indicative of unsound lending&#13;
policies and/or procedures. Similar ratios should be estimated for all&#13;
types of lending to allow the implementation of timely corrective measures&#13;
if required. An overall deterioration in the ratios would indicate that RBI&#13;
targets for priority sector lending may be too ambitious and may be forcing&#13;
banks to relax their loan appraisal methods in order to achieve the targets.&#13;
This would also mean that a large amount of resources are being locked up in&#13;
bad loans.&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
SELECTED INSTRUMENTS OF MONETARY AND CREDIT POLICY&#13;
4.1     India has a very complex system of credit and monetary policies&#13;
designed to channel credit to priority sectors, groups and/or regions,&#13;
sometimes at subsidized rates of interest, and to regulate the overall&#13;
volume of credit and money in the economy. Monetary policy is broadly&#13;
guided to achieve price stability through the regulation of money supply&#13;
and bank credit. As in most developing countries, two sets of control&#13;
instruments are used in India: general credit controls and selective credit&#13;
controls. The general credit control techniques are open market operations,&#13;
Bank rate and variable reserve requirements. The following types of selec-&#13;
tive credit policies are implemented in India: (a) differential rediscount&#13;
rates; (b) guidelines on credit floors or minimum proportion of total credit&#13;
or total deposits which must be lent to specific priority borrowers&#13;
(analyzed in the previous chapter); (c) credit ceilings on non-priority&#13;
lending or on the aggregate volume of loans (such as the Credit&#13;
Authorization Scheme); (d) extraction of a large proportion of funds of&#13;
non-specialized depository institutions (such as commercial banks) through&#13;
reserve requirements, to be channeled to the Government or to&#13;
Government-owned specialized financial institutions; and (e) extensive&#13;
intervention in the determination of borrowing and lending interest rates.&#13;
These policies are complemented by fiscal policy instruments such as tax&#13;
exemptions and deductions.&#13;
4.2     In addition, the RBI has a policy of selective credit control to&#13;
regulate the flow of bank credit for purchase of specific commodities. The&#13;
commodities covered are: (i) foodgrains; (ii) selected major oilseeds and&#13;
products; (iii) raw cotton and Kapas; (iv) sugar/gur/Khandsari; and&#13;
(v) cotton textiles. The objective is to prevent speculative holding of&#13;
essential commodities. The main instruments of selective credit control&#13;
are (a) minimum margin for lending against the value of specified&#13;
securities; (b) ceiling on the level of credit; and (c) minimum rate of&#13;
interest on advances. Since the control has to be exercised to prevent the&#13;
financing of speculative activities in the selected commodities without, at&#13;
the same time, affecting normal operations of production, the regulation is&#13;
not uniform for all borrowers.&#13;
4.3     This paper will not attempt to review each of these instruments of&#13;
monetary policy but will look at those selected policy instruments which&#13;
have considerable effect on the mobilization of savings and the allocation&#13;
of credit.l/ Since the previous chapter dealt extensively with priority&#13;
sector lending targets, the analysis here will focus on reserve&#13;

requirements, the workings of the Credit Authorization Scheme and the struc-&#13;
ture of interest rates.&#13;
A. RESERVE REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.4     Scheduled banks are required to hold minimum balances with the&#13;
Reserve Bank as a proportion of their liabilities in India. Before 1962,&#13;
banks were required to hold as liquid assets no less than 20% of total&#13;
liabilities, inclusive of balances to be held on account of cash reserve&#13;
requirement (CRR). In 1962, through an amendment of the Banking Regulation&#13;
Act, this requirement was raised to 25%, exclusive of required cash&#13;
balances, which at that time were at a level of 3%. Thus the reserve&#13;
requirements were divided into two: (a) the cash reserve ratio which is&#13;
a minimum cash balance which the banks have to hold with the RBI; and&#13;
(b) the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) which is an asset requirement to&#13;
be held by each bank against its liabilities. The liquid assets eligible&#13;
for meeting this requirement are the following: gold, cash, unencumbered&#13;
approved securitiesl/ and balances with the RBI and with other banks. The&#13;
CRR is an instrument of credit control in the strict sense of the term since&#13;
it affects the availability of reserves with the banking system and affects&#13;
the total volume of credit.2/ The SLR is more a means of allocating funds&#13;
between the public and the private sector than an instrument of credit&#13;
control.&#13;
4.5     According to the RBI, the rationale for the introduction of the SLR&#13;
was exclusively of monetary nature: the desire to eliminate the possibility&#13;
of banks offsetting the effect of increases in reserve requirements (in the&#13;
CRR) through liquidation of holdings of Government securities. It appears&#13;
that the initial intention of the SLR was to enhance the ability of the RBI&#13;
to control overall liquidity. The statutory liquidity ratio has been&#13;
increased in successive stages from its initial level of 25% to its present&#13;
level of 36%.3/ These further increases in the ratio have been based on two&#13;
additional considerations: (a) an attempt to reduce banks' discretionary&#13;
power to provide credit to the private sector; and (b) the use of the SLR as&#13;
1/ "Approved" securities are those debt obligations issued and guaranteed&#13;
by the Union or State Government or issues of specified agencies,&#13;
including institutions like IDBI and ICICI, bearing government&#13;
guarantee.&#13;
2/ The CRR is currently 8.5% of bank deposits. In addition, the RBI has&#13;
instructed commercial banks to impound 10% of the growth in deposits&#13;
from November 12, 1983 which is expected to block Rs 2.5-3 billion of&#13;
bank funds every six months as incremental cash reserve ratio.&#13;
According to RBI, this measure was taken to wipe out continued excess&#13;
liquidity in the system with a view of ensuring a better match between&#13;
sources and uses of funds. Adequate credit monitoring should prevent&#13;
any undesirable reduction in the flow of credit for productive purposes.&#13;
3/ The RBI raised the SLR from 35% to 35.5% effective July 28, 1984 and&#13;
36% effective September 1, 1984.&#13;

an instrument for supporting the Government's market borrowing program and&#13;
increasing resources for Plan purposes at a cost substantially lower than&#13;
the rate charged by banks on advances to borrowers. The SLR has increased&#13;
parallel to the expansion of public sector borrowing requirements. It&#13;
currently stands at 36% but since December 1979 the RBI is empowered to&#13;
raise the SLR up to 40% if so required. The SLR affects credit creation by&#13;
reducing the amount available for lending but does not have a deflationary&#13;
impact on the money supply (unlike the cash reserve ratio).&#13;

4.6     Table 4.1 shows that in the early 1950s bank holdings of Government&#13;
and other approved securities were in excess of reserve requirements. Banks&#13;
invested well over one-third of aggregate deposits in Government&#13;
securities,l/ a situation that changed in the early 1960s due to the com-&#13;
bined effect of better business opportunities for increased lending and a&#13;
relative decline in the yield of Government securities as compared to&#13;
returns on bank loans. The data for the 1950s contradict the general view&#13;
that commercial banks hold Government securities merely because they are&#13;
directed to do so by the RBI. Only in recent years does the ratio appears&#13;
to be just about the prescribed level, having stayed higher in earlier&#13;
years. During the slack season in business demand for advances, Government&#13;
securities provide the banks with an alternative asset to hold. The recent&#13;
tendency for holdings of Government securities to hover around the&#13;
prescribed SLR level suggests that the SLR limits are quite high; and that&#13;
banks do not find it very profitable to invest a larger proportion of their&#13;
resources in those assets. The increase in the differential between bank&#13;
lending rates and yields on Government securities is probably the major&#13;

Government approved investments, such as subscribing in long-term&#13;
capital issues of term-finance institutions, etc.&#13;

cause of this latter development (Table 4.2). Nonetheless, the scheduled&#13;
commercial banks are the major holders of Government securities, holding&#13;
about 45% and 55% of outstanding interest bearing loans of the Central and&#13;
State Government, respectively (March 1980 data).&#13;

4.7     The SLR reallocates funds to the public sector at lower cost than&#13;
the market rate of bank loans in a non-inflationary manner. Compared to&#13;
taxation, another non-inflationary source of funding for government&#13;
expenditures, it is easier to administer and politically less controversial.&#13;
It does have, however, several drawbacks. One negative aspect is that&#13;
beyond a certain limit, it reduces the effectiveness and flexibility of the&#13;
monetary authority in controlling credit expansion. This occurs because a&#13;
high SLR coupled with the need to meet credit requirements of the private&#13;
sector limit RBI's ability to use alternative instruments of credit control.&#13;
Another negative aspect of the SLR is that by creating a captive market for&#13;
Government securities yielding lower returns than alternative securities&#13;
from the private sector, it hinders the development of a truly competitive&#13;
security market. Furthermore, it fails to give correct price signals to the&#13;
Government on the real cost of credit and probably reduces the interest&#13;
banks can pay on deposits. Finally, since return to borrowers are lower&#13;
than market rates it is a hidden tax. The existence of SLR and a "captive"&#13;
market guarantees funding to the public sector but does not provide adequate&#13;
signals on the real cost of funds which should be used to discount the&#13;
various public expenditure alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. CREDIT AUTHORIZATION SCHEME&#13;
4.8     The Credit Authorization Scheme (CAS) was introduced by the RBI in&#13;
November 1965 as one of the measures to align bank credit in accordance with&#13;
Plan priorities. It subjects large individual credit proposals to the&#13;
scrutiny of the RBI to ensure that they conform to the requirements of its&#13;
credit policy. Under the scheme, scheduled banks are required to obtain&#13;
authorization from the RBI before releasing any fresh credit limit above a&#13;
certain amount (initially Rs 10 million, presently Rs 40 million)l/ to&#13;
certain single parties, or any limit that would take the total credit limits&#13;
enjoyed by such parties (from the banking system as a whole) to such amount.&#13;
In 1970, the focus was widened to cover credit appraisal by the scheduled&#13;
commercial banks to impose financial discipline on the large borrowers. The&#13;
RBI introduced a comprehensive set of norms for credit appraisal with the&#13;
purpose of assisting banks in the proper assessment of credit requirements.&#13;
This reduced the flexibility banks had in appraising and justifying addi-&#13;
tional credit limits. In May 1971, the Scheme was further extended to&#13;
include term credit. Provision of term credit to any single party beyond&#13;
Rs 2.5 million (currently Rs 5 million) from the banking system as a whole&#13;
requires previous RBI authorization.2/ In 1973, advances to public sector&#13;
undertakings, including State Electricity Boards and also advances against&#13;
the guarantees of Central and State Governments were brought under the&#13;
system.&#13;
4.9     As Table 4.3 shows, the CAS predominantly affects working capital&#13;
requirements though it also affects term lending and sale of machinery on&#13;
deferred payment basis. As of June 30, 1982, credit limits under the CAS&#13;
stood at Rs 159.1 billion and affected 1251 parties of which 204 were of&#13;
the public sector and accounted for 52.6Z of the total credit limits. The&#13;
sharp reduction in the number of parties affected in 1976 was due to an&#13;
increase in the cut-off point for the CAS from Rs 10 million to Rs 20&#13;
million. The increase, in July 1982 of the cut-off point to Rs 30 million&#13;
for private sector enterprises reduced the number of parties subject to CAS&#13;
as of June 30, 1983 to 897. The recent increase in the cut-off point to&#13;
Rs 40 million for all enterprises should reduce the number of parties&#13;
affected even further.&#13;
4.10    In 1975 and 1979, the CAS was further modified following the recom-&#13;
mendations of the Tandon (1974) and Chore (1979) Committees 3/ which were&#13;
set up to provide guidelines to banks on the provision of credit par-&#13;
ticularly to large borrowers. Among the more important recommendations were&#13;
1/ On October 20, 1983 the cut-off point under the CAS was raised from&#13;
Rs 30 million to Rs 40 million.&#13;
2/ Term credit is defined as loans repayable over a period of more than&#13;
three years.&#13;

4.11    The Tandon Committee proposed the following three approaches to&#13;
working capital financing by banks and also recommended that to avoid&#13;
hardships on borrowers, a start should be made with method (i) and a move to&#13;
higher stages should be made thereafter.&#13;
(i) banks should determine the working capital gap (i.e., total&#13;
current assets less current liabilities other than bank borrowings) and&#13;
finance 75% of this gap. The balance would be covered by long-term funds&#13;
(owned funds plus term loans). This method of lending would bring under&#13;
some control, those cases involving adverse current ratios, and raise the&#13;
ratios to better than 1:1;&#13;
(ii) the borrower should provide a minimum of 25% of total current&#13;
assets from long-term funds (i.e., owned funds plus term borrowings). After&#13;
allowing for a level of credit for purchases and other liabilities, banks&#13;
would provide the balance. The total amount of current liabilities, includ-&#13;
ing bank finance, would not exceed 75% of current assets. This mode of&#13;
lending would give a minimum current ratio of 1.33:1; and&#13;
(iii) the third method would be the same as (ii) above but would&#13;
exclude core current assets from total current assets on the theory that&#13;
core current assets should be financed from long-term funds. This method&#13;
would further strengthen the current ratio, to reach a level of 1.8:1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
4.12    The main recommendation of Chore Committee is that banks should&#13;
adopt method (ii) of lending and this has been made applicable to borrowers&#13;
having working capital limits of Rs 5 million and above from the banking&#13;
system. Thus, all medium and large units should maintain a minimum current&#13;
ratio of 1.33:1. Borrowers not able to comply with this requirement&#13;
immediately are to be given "working capital term loans" (WCTL) carved out&#13;
of the existing working capital limits, repayable within five years. WCTL&#13;
will carry a rate of interest, at least as high as the rate for cash credit&#13;
and banks may, at their discretion, charge a higher rate of interest not&#13;
exceeding the ceiling rate to encourage early liquidation of WCTL. Further,&#13;
penal rates of interest can be charged in the event of any default in the&#13;
repayment of WCTL.&#13;
4.13    Thus the Chore Committee proposals seek to impose the discipline of&#13;
the current ratio of 1.33:1 rather rigorously on all medium and large units.&#13;
No distinction has been made between infant units and others. The liquidity&#13;
constraints that new units and others with ongoing projects may face, have,&#13;
however, been recognized and banks have been authorized to make suitable&#13;
relaxation depending on the merits of the case, in consultation with term-&#13;
lending institutions. Exporting units also are subject to this discipline,&#13;
though discretionary powers have been given to banks to relax in suitable&#13;
cases. Only sick units have been exempted from the norm. By and large, all&#13;
large and medium units having credit limits of Rs 5.0 million and more from&#13;
the banking system have to abide by the norm.&#13;
4.14    Despite the fact that the Tandon/Chore norms do provide some&#13;
flexibility, they have been criticized on various grounds: (a) the&#13;
guidelines are not flexible enough to hold good throughout the year and in&#13;
a constantly changing economic environment (the composition of size of&#13;
inventories varies throughout the year and between years subject to fluctua-&#13;
tions in economic activity); (b) the classification of industry into 15&#13;
groups does not make allowance for relevant individual characteristics such&#13;
as variances in financial strength, market circumstances and management&#13;
strength; (c) the recommendations are also too restrictive since they try to&#13;
enforce two separate types of control: restrictions on inventory holding by&#13;
industry and trade and by type of inventory, and limits on the extent of&#13;
bank finance in total working capital.&#13;
4.15    In practice credit authorization can take up to six months from the&#13;
date the request is made to a commercial bank until the RBI approval,&#13;
thereby causing delays in credit allocation which may arrive too late to&#13;
correct for situations which call for deviations from norms and limits. On&#13;
average, authorizations take from one to three months. Situations such as&#13;
bunched receipt of raw materials, strikes, lockouts and other interruptions&#13;
in production, transport delays, power shortages and accumulation of&#13;
finished goods due to lack of shipping space for exports, are common in&#13;
India. Industry should not be penalized for those developments. One&#13;
response to this kind of criticism has been that firms tend to exaggerate&#13;
their credit requirements to protect themselves from such unforeseen events&#13;
and in anticipation of perceived credit restrictions. This argument,&#13;
however, undercuts the whole rationale for the credit authorization scheme&#13;
and of credit allocation schemes in general.&#13;

4.16    The CAS has recently been reviewed by the Marathe Committee whose&#13;
major recommendations were reviewed and approved by the RBI Board in October&#13;
1983. As a result, the Reserve Bank has increased the banks' discretion to&#13;
deploy credit under CAS, even without RBI's prior clearance. The RBI listed&#13;
specific situations in which this could be done. Borrowers have to meet&#13;
five conditions, including a minimum current ratio of 1.33:1, in order to be&#13;
eligible for preferential treatment. For instance, the banks could give&#13;
clearance in cases where the estimates and projections regarding production,&#13;
sales, chargeable current assets, other current assets, current liabilities&#13;
(other than bank borrowings) and net working capital conform to past trends&#13;
and norms. The RBI also indicated that the banks are permitted to use their&#13;
discretion only where the projected current ratio is not below 1.33:1&#13;
(except under exempted categories) and any fall in it from a higher level in&#13;
the past to the projected level is on account of permissible activitiesl/&#13;
indicated by the RBI and not due to any diversion of funds outside the&#13;
company. Banks are also allowed to release funds without RBI permission to&#13;
those borrowers who have been submitting quarterly operating statements&#13;
regularly for the past six months within the stipulated time, and undertake&#13;
to do so in the future. Banks can now release up to 75% of the new limits&#13;
requested in the case of export oriented manufacturing assets and up to 50%&#13;
to other borrowers. These discretionary powers should speed up release of&#13;
funds to some borrowers but the proposals will go through the normal process&#13;
of RBI scrutiny. If, as a result of the scrutiny, the credit limit sanc-&#13;
tioned is found to be excessive, the RBI can direct banks to take corrective&#13;
actions. This relaxation is welcome because it will reduce undue interrup-&#13;
tions to productive activity.&#13;
4.17    One reason for the existence of the CAS is to enhance credit control&#13;
and planning by the RBI. Indian banking largely operates on the cash credit&#13;
system under which banks have no control over the level of advances and no&#13;
notice is required for drawing up to limits that may remain unutilized for&#13;
long periods. As such, banks are not able to plan their credit operations.&#13;
The Tandon and Dehejia Committees 2/ suggested that the credit limits should&#13;
be bifurcated into a loan and cash credit. The loan would comprise the&#13;
minimum level of borrowing which the borrower expects to use throughout the&#13;
year, known as "core current assets" while the cash credit part would meet&#13;
the fluctuating requirements. The RBI initially accepted the need for a&#13;
change in the credit system, but then reversed its position when the Chore&#13;
Committee in 1979 recommended against shifting from cash credit to loan or&#13;
bill financing thus reducing even further the likelihood of a change in the&#13;
system.&#13;
4.18    Unless the importance of cash credit system is reduced, it is very&#13;
unlikely that the RBI will further liberalize or eliminate the CAS. The CAS&#13;
1/ Permissible activities are: expansion of existing capacity,&#13;
diversification, fuller utilization of capacity and rise in working&#13;
capital requirements because of abnormal price increases.&#13;

allows the RBI to have a tighter control on monetary developments. Before&#13;
the implementation of the Tandon norms, the total credit limits sanctioned&#13;
by the banking system exceeded total deposits (before deducting reserve&#13;
requirements). The Tandon Committee also found that in June 1974 the actual&#13;
utilization of credit limits was only 57% thus in effect 43% of the credit&#13;
limits sanctioned remained unutilized. As a result of changes to CAS this&#13;
situation has changed in recent years.&#13;

4.19    The RBI should review the CAS taking into consideration the intended&#13;
purposes of the scheme and the extent to which it is required to pursue&#13;
those objectives. The allocative aspect of the CAS may have been necessary&#13;
in 1965 when the scheme was initially implemented, but with the present very&#13;
specific priority sector lending targets, it seems to be redundant. With&#13;
respect to the credit control aspect, it seems that a reduction in this role&#13;
will only be possible through a shift from cash credit to loan credits.&#13;
Nevertheless, even now the existence of the CAS is based on the assumption&#13;
that businesses use credit lavishly or for unproductive purposes. Since&#13;
credit is not a grant but a loan with very high financial costs (interest&#13;
rates as high as 18%) and since efficient management of firms calls for&#13;
maintaining working capital requirements (and borrowings) at the operation-&#13;
ally minimum level, the rationale beyond the assumption does not appear to&#13;
be very convincing.&#13;
4.20    Two additional aspects of the CAS require further scrutiny:    (a) the&#13;
rationale for subjecting public sector enterprises to CAS control; and&#13;
(b) the scope for reducing the role of the RBI, which currently acts as the&#13;
head office of commercial banks for CAS purposes, to that of overseer.&#13;
Banks would still be required to follow certain norms, at least initially,&#13;
and the RBI would monitor the implementation through random checkups without&#13;
having to approve all requests for credit extension under the scheme.&#13;

C. INTEREST RATE POLICY&#13;
1. Introduction&#13;
4.21    The level and structure of interest rates in India is administra-&#13;
tively fixed by the Government. Bank interest rates are not determined by&#13;
competitive market forces, but are largely resultant of policy decisions.&#13;
Interest ceilings are also imposed in the least controlled end of the finan-&#13;
cial market which comprises company shares, debentures and deposits.&#13;
4.22    Interest rates can perform three basic functions when allowed to&#13;
find their equilibrium market levels through the interaction of the forces&#13;
of supply and demand: (a) contribute to mobilize an adequate level of&#13;
savings by acting as the price which influences the choice between present&#13;
and future consumption; (b) act as efficient rationing devices for the&#13;
allocation of scarce resources between alternative investments; and (c)&#13;
provide a social discount rate for saving and investment decisions. Since&#13;
most interest rates in India are administratively fixed by the Government&#13;
these basic functions are not fully performed. On the contrary, interest&#13;
rate policy has been designed to achieve the following objectives: (a)&#13;
support activities of particular sectors through lending at preferential&#13;
rates; (b) finance the Government's considerable borrowing requirements as&#13;
cheaply as possible; (c) provide framework for macroeconomic stability; and&#13;
(d) encourage the mobilization of financial savings. Thus, interest rates&#13;
do not necessarily act as rationing devices for the allocation of scarce&#13;
resources between alternative investments. This role is being performed by&#13;
the Government through other mechanisms such as priority sector lending and&#13;
overall credit policy which are generally less efficient for this purpose.&#13;
Furthermore, the pursuit of an interest rate policy which attempts to sup-&#13;
port these four sometimes conflicting objectives has the potential for&#13;
misallocation of resources by promoting activities in preferred sectors&#13;
(including some public investments) which may not otherwise be economically&#13;
viable.&#13;
4.23    Interest rates are affected by Government policy both directly and&#13;
indirectly. As a major borrower, the Government regulates the rate of&#13;
interest on its securities, small savings schemes, etc., and, as an impor-&#13;
tant lender, determines the rates of interest on the loans and advances it&#13;
gives directly and indirectly for a wide array of activities, institutions&#13;
and individuals, both in the public and private sectors. The Government&#13;
uses various policy instruments to control and regulate the structure of&#13;
interest rates. The RBI regulates the rediscount rate (Bank rate) and&#13;
interest rates on bank deposits and bank credit, the Controller of Capital&#13;
Issues fixes interest rates on debentures and preference shares, the&#13;
Government and RBI dictate interest on Government securities, and finally&#13;
the Government (Ministry of Finance) fixes on-lending rates for loan and&#13;
advances for Government-related activities performed by State Governments,&#13;
Ports, Development Banks and other public sector institutions. In addition,&#13;
the Government sets the wide range of rates applicable to the various tiers&#13;
of cooperative societies and development institutions. Some of these rates&#13;
also vary from State to State being subject to State legislation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Structure of Interest Rates&#13;
4.24    The structure of interest rates in India is very complex since most&#13;
rates in the organized market are to some degree subjected to Government&#13;
control. Rates are differentiated on a large variety of criteria such as:&#13;
the size of loans, maturity, source of funds, activity or purpose of the&#13;
loan, group or sector to which the borrower belongs, or region where the&#13;
money is allocated. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 show the evolution, in nominal&#13;
terms, of the structure of major types of interest rates in India. The&#13;
tables are by no means comprehensive.&#13;
4.25    An analysis of the data highlight the following features of India's&#13;
interest rate behavior. First, there is a trend toward increasing nominal&#13;
interest rates. This upward adjustment in nominal rates probably reflects&#13;
the scarcity of capital and higher inflation rates. Real rates, on the&#13;
contrary, have shown wide fluctuations with negative deposit rates during 8&#13;
of the past 13 years and positive lending rates almost throughout the period&#13;
since 1970/71 (excluding 1973-1975).l/ Second, short-term rates on deposits&#13;
are lower than those on longer-term deposits. This follows the expected&#13;
pattern: higher interest has to be offered to savers to encourage them to&#13;
lend at longer maturities. Third, loan rates of interest are generally&#13;
higher than rates on deposits. Therefore, the inversion of deposit and loan&#13;
rates which occurs in many LDCs is not a widespread phenomenon in India,&#13;
although it occurs in some instances where financial institutions accept&#13;
deposits with higher interest rates than their lowest loan rates of similar&#13;
maturities. This reduces the institution's profitability by reducing the&#13;
spread between average deposit rates and average lending rates.&#13;
4.26    Fourth, term lending rates are lower than those for short-term&#13;
loans. This runs counter to what would be expected in a freely operating&#13;
market: higher rates on longer maturities. Rates on term lending are kept&#13;
low with a view of promoting long-term investment. Some authors indicate&#13;
that this reversal in the rates tends to reduce funds available for long-&#13;
term investment by financial institutions which find short-term lending more&#13;
profitable. This phenomenon is not apparent in India because of the exist-&#13;
ence of specialized financial institutions and credit allocation policies&#13;
which direct funds for specific purposes and maturities. Institutions such&#13;
as IDBI, ICICI, NABARD, etc. which have to lend a considerable proportion of&#13;
their portfolio at long maturities are able to do so because they are&#13;
allowed to float securities in the "captive market" created by the SLR to&#13;
which commercial banks are subjected. In addition, cooperative societies&#13;
are permitted to pay higher rates to depositors and lend at lower rates&#13;
compared to commercial banks, operating on a smaller spread supported by&#13;
Government subsidies and/or concessional finance from the Reserve Bank.&#13;

4.27    Fifth, deposit and lending rates are subjected to either floors or&#13;
ceilings (sometimes to both) which account for the complexity of the&#13;
structure. There is a significant spread between ceilings and minimum&#13;
interest rates and between interest rates for preferred and non-preferred&#13;
activities. Finally, Government securities yield less than private&#13;
securities due not only to their lower risk, but also to the existence of a&#13;
captive market for Government securities which constraints upward movement&#13;
of interest rates on Government approved securities.&#13;
3. Commercial Bank Rates&#13;
4.28    Since the early 1950s, commercial bank rates moved progressively&#13;
from being market rates to being administered rates. In 1964 the RBI moved&#13;
to set the deposit rates offered by banks directly and imposed a ceiling&#13;
rate on general advances. Prior to that, there was no control over the&#13;
general level of lending rates although minimum lending rates were&#13;
prescribed on loans secured by sensitive commodities. In January 1970, the&#13;
ceiling on general advances was withdrawn. In the period from January 1970&#13;
to June 1973 there was no explicit control over the rate on general&#13;
advances, although a minimum lending rate continued to be specified against&#13;
commodities subject to selective credit controls. In June 1973, the RBI&#13;
imposed a minimum lending rate on general advances. The minimum lending&#13;
rate on general advances has remained in effect. Established initially at&#13;
10%, it was raised since to 13.5%. In March 1976 the RBI re-imposed the&#13;
ceiling on advances to discourage usury practices by certain banks.&#13;
Currently, therefore, for general lending purposes, banks are operating&#13;
within the confines of a minimum lending rate of 13.5% and a ceiling rate of&#13;
18%. Lower rates are available under the Differential Rate of Interest&#13;
Scheme which directs banks to lend at least 1% of their loan portfolio at 4%&#13;
rates of interest to small businessmen, small farmers, selected tribes and&#13;
scheduled castes, and for activities in backward regions. Intermediate&#13;
rates between 4% and 13.5% (generally clustered around 10-12%) are also&#13;
available for some types of exports, food procurement, and deferred&#13;
payments.&#13;
4.29    India has a very complex interest rate structure which needs to be&#13;
rationalized in order to raise the efficiency of financial intermediation.&#13;
The Government's rationale for this complex structure is the need to promote&#13;
certain priority sectors. However, a comparison of average rates of inter-&#13;
est on loans to different sectors shows that while there is a difference&#13;
between average on-lending rates to different sectors, the spread is very&#13;
small. For instance, in June 1978 the average lending rate for agriculture&#13;
and allied activities was 12.5% as compared to 13.9% for retail activities&#13;
and 12.9% for total credit outstanding. In addition, up to 1978 the average&#13;
cost of credit to priority sectors was quite close to the average cost to&#13;
non-priority sectors. This has been changed in recent years with a widening&#13;
spread between average onlending rates to different sectors. In 1981 the&#13;
average lending rate to priority sectors was 13.6% as compared to 15.8% for&#13;
non-priority sectors and 14.9% for total credit.&#13;
4.30    While the data are incomplete and more recent data show a wider&#13;
spread between lending rates to different sectors, it still is not clear&#13;
that such a complex interest rate structure is required to promote specific&#13;
activities. The analysis of data on credit outstanding by interest rate and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-&#13;
sector also indicates that preferential interest rates are available to&#13;
selected borrowers in all sectors, regardless of their activities or purpose&#13;
of the loan. Therefore, the complex interest rate structure appears to&#13;
favor certain borrowers who are able to obtain low rates, but does not&#13;
necessarily contribute to the promotion of priority sectors as a whole.&#13;
Since India also has a very detailed credit allocation policy in addition to&#13;
a complex set of interest rates, the interest rate structure could be&#13;
simplified without significantly altering the direction of credit. While it&#13;
is important to promote the development of previously neglected sectors, it&#13;
is also important to recognize the costs and limitations of such efforts.&#13;
4.31    A rationalization of interest rate structure would bring about&#13;
several benefits: (a) it would reduce administrative cost to banks&#13;
associated with the complex interest rate structure; (b) it could lead to an&#13;
overall reduction in interest rates since the new structure should aim at&#13;
reducing the spread between ceiling and minimum interest rates with some&#13;
categories being charged higher rates and others experiencing a reduction;&#13;
and (c) it would reduce the potential negative effects of interest subsidies&#13;
and extensive cross-subsidization, such as: reduction in the aggregate&#13;
supply of credit and inappropriate technology choice because of biases in&#13;
factor prices in favor of capital and against labor.&#13;

rate range in 1980. While the average lending rate was 13.6%, the interest&#13;
rate range varied from 4% to 19.5%, indicating a significant spread in&#13;
lending rates. A rationalization of the structure should aim at reducing&#13;
the spread without reducing the profitability of banks. This can be&#13;
accomplished by a reduction in ceiling rates together with an increase in&#13;
concessional rates, particularly those under the DRI Scheme and others to&#13;
preferred customers.&#13;

4.33    Any attempt to rationalize interest rates should take into con-&#13;
sideration the need to maintain a reasonable spread between average lending&#13;
rates of financial institutions and average cost of funds. Commercial banks&#13;
pay an average 7.5% to depositors and get an average 13.5% on lending&#13;
thereby operating on a 6% spread. This spread is high when compared to that&#13;
in other countries (a typical spread is 3%) but is necessary to cover bank-&#13;
ing costs including the cost of maintaining a large proportion of its port-&#13;
folio in low-yield assets. Discounting the effect of the SLR and CRR, the&#13;
spread between average lending rates and financial cost of funds is reduced&#13;
to 2.5%-3%.1/ This spread is just enough to cover administrative costs and&#13;
allow a small return on assets.&#13;
1/ Calculated based on: zero return on 3% maintained as CRR, 8% return&#13;
on additional 4% maintained as CRR, 6.25% average return on 35% kept as&#13;
SLR and 13.5% average return on lending (58% of total deposits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
4.34    In addition to revising the structure of interest rates, the&#13;
Government could also contemplate the possibility of gradually delegating&#13;
the responsibility of setting interest rates to the commercial banks on the&#13;
basis of cost of funds and expected benefits and risks. The large number of&#13;
banks in India should allow the formation of a truly competitive market.&#13;
4. Differential Rate of Interest Scheme (DRI)&#13;
4.35    This scheme was introduced by public sector banks in 1972.    Under&#13;
this scheme, loans are provided to low-income beneficiaries, for starting&#13;
any income-generating viable project at a concessional interest rate of four&#13;
percent per annum. Progress under this scheme has been impressive and banks&#13;
are already meeting the target of 1% of total advances. As of June 1981,&#13;
the number of DRI accounts stood at 2.7 million and the amount of loans&#13;
outstanding on these accounts was Rs 2.25 billion, for an average loan&#13;
amount of Rs 844. The performance in terms of loan utilization and&#13;
repayment, however, has not been very successful. The National Institute&#13;
of Bank Management has recently completed a study of the DRI schemel/ which&#13;
indicates the need for remedial actions. Some measures suggested are:&#13;
(a) raise the income limits for eligibility; (b) raise the interest rate&#13;
from the current 4% to 7% or 8% to encourage banks to have a more active&#13;
role in loan preparation; supervision and follow up; (c) increase the amount&#13;
of the loans to at least Rs 2000 so that it can be used for income-&#13;
generating activity; and (d) provide indirect financing, i.e., through&#13;
cooperatives, development corporations, etc. (this would facilitate credit&#13;
administration, supervision and recovery).&#13;
5. Nominal vs Real Interest Rates&#13;
4.36    Considerable disagreement exist in the economic literature over the&#13;
influence exerted by interest rates on the volume of savings and investment.&#13;
Nevertheless, the available empirical evidence tend to suggest that there is&#13;
a positive relationship between savings and interest rates, especially when&#13;
rates become positive in real terms after having been maintained at substan-&#13;
tially negative real levels by administrative action.2/ The role of inter-&#13;
est rates in the mobilization of savings may be completely offset if nominal&#13;
interest rates do not increase proportionately to inflation. However,&#13;
determining the true "real" rate of interest is a problematic exercise since&#13;
it should be based on expected inflation and not on short-run changes of any&#13;
particular price index. A "second best" solution to the problem is to&#13;
estimate real interest rates by using as an adjustment factor the weighted&#13;
average of current and past annual averages of an inflation index such as&#13;

1/  Expected inflation is calculated from a distributed lag on current and past inflation rates (WPI, annual increase).&#13;
The weights are: 0.333 for t; 0.267 for t-l; 0.200 for t-2; 0.133 for t-e and 0.067 for t-4. Weights were arbitrarily&#13;
selected based on ratio 5:4:3:2:1.&#13;

the Wholesale Price Index.1/ Table 4.9 shows nominal and real interest rate&#13;
for selected financial assets in the last few years. The pattern that&#13;
emerges is comparable for both short and long-term instruments. Changes in&#13;
nominal rates (administered by the RBI) are less frequent and volatile than&#13;
the adjustment factor which fluctuated between 16.9% in 1974/75 and 3.4% in&#13;
1978/79.&#13;
4.37    While lending rates have generally been positive in real terms,_&#13;
deposit rates have fluctuated more widely. Real deposit rates ranged from&#13;
2.5% in 1978/79 to minus 8.7% in 1974/75. Government securities have t[adi-&#13;
tionally yielded very low returns with negative real yields almost&#13;
throughout the 1970s -- with the exclusion of 1978/79, a year of very p1w&#13;
inflation. India t--oes not have serious interest rate problems although it&#13;
should adjust yields on Government securities to close the existing gap with&#13;
returns on other financial assets. Despite this the overall level of inter-&#13;
est rates in India does appear to encourage mobilization of savings and&#13;
resources.&#13;
4.38    While India has generally maintained positive real interest rates,&#13;
temporary upsurges in inflation have caused real interest rates to turn&#13;
negative sporadically. Negative real interest rates are not a significant&#13;
cause for concern in India because the phenomenon is temporary (recent&#13;
upsurges in inflation were promptly brought under control) and also because&#13;
the rates turned only slightly negative excluding the period 1973-1975. A&#13;
policy of constant adjustment of interest rates to reflect short-term&#13;
changes in inflation and allow for continuous positive real rates could have&#13;
potential disruptive effects on economic activity. This could happen&#13;
because price fluctuations in India very much reflect the vagaries of nature&#13;
and its effects on agricultural performance, therefore a policy of&#13;
continuous adjustment in interest rates would lead to undesirably sharp&#13;
fluctuations in nominal rates. The current policy of frequent but small&#13;
revisions of interest rates is a more sensible approach.   This policy has&#13;
allowed the expansion and deepening of the Indian financial system despite&#13;
some inflationary spurts. Nevertheless, as indicated earlier, some aspects&#13;
of interest rate policy in India have the potential for misallocating&#13;
resources and should be corrected.&#13;
1/ The weighting is arbitrarily assigned at the ratio 5:4:3:2:1, current&#13;
to previous four years, respectively.&#13;

            decades. The study concentrates on the "organized"
            segment of the system which includes commercial, development
            and cooperative banks, the stock market, and various
            non-banking financial institutions including insurance
            corporations and mutual funds. The paper also highlights
            several policy issues in the sector in an attempt to
            spearhead discussions and further analytical work. The paper
            first describes the institutional structure of the financial
            system and then analyzes its evolution and financial
            interrelations using a flow of funds framework and other
            relevant tools of financial planning. The paper then
            identifies and analyzes some issues related to credit
            planning, including credit allocation policies and selected
            instruments of monetary and credit policy such as interest
            rates. The analysis of these policies is particularly
            relevant since credit planning is an important element in
            India's financial system. The paper provides a broad
            description and analysis of these policies and indicates
            areas in which further work may be necessary.
