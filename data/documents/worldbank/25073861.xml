&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Well, frankly speaking, I don't know where to start, see, because it's quite a&#13;
long period of associations with the World Bank. Maybe if I take a relatively short&#13;
period at the beginning of the present administration . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: You know, letâ&#128;&#153;s put this way: the--since independence when Sukarno was&#13;
president, which lasted until â&#128;&#152;65, then the present president took over somewhere in '66.&#13;
So maybe if we take about the beginning period of the present administration . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would be fine.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: . . because I think really the real meaningful association with the World Bank&#13;
started only from that time on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: '68, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Yeah. Well, you know, at the end of September of '65 we have a coup here.&#13;
The communist party attempted a coup that failed, and then in March â&#128;&#152;66 Suharto at that&#13;
time virtually took over the government. At that time formally speaking Sukarno was the&#13;
president, but on the 11th of March in 1966 he gave virtual power of attorney to Suharto&#13;
to administer the country, to see to it that there is peace, no more fighting and so on. So&#13;
de facto Suharto took over the government from the then president Sukarno in March&#13;
1966.&#13;
&#13;
I think in 1966 when the first serious negotiations or serious exchanges of mind took&#13;
place between Indonesia with the World Bank and the [International Monetary] Fund,&#13;
the economy at the time was in very bad shape, so what was very much in our mind is&#13;
how to check inflation and later on how to start to rehabilitate the economy and so on&#13;
because we were not thinking at all about any development program at the time; the&#13;
worry is how to check inflation because at that time inflation run high annually on&#13;
something like 660 percent of [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
Virtually that was, I think, the first serious attempt to have a working economic&#13;
relationship with so-called Western countries because before that Indonesia was closely&#13;
cooperating with socialist countries but not that much really with the so-called Western&#13;
countries. So in the beginning months, first negotiations were started with teams from&#13;
the Fund, teams from the World Bank, and some embassies here in Jakarta. I think I&#13;
would not exaggerate that we had the good fortune of having three good representatives&#13;
of three very influential parties. The one from the Fund is Kemal Siber; maybe you have&#13;
seen him.&#13;

                                 November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, we have.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: He is in Jakarta right now. He was representing the Fund. The one who was&#13;
representing the Bank at the time was Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell. And from the American&#13;
embassy we had the good fortune to have Stokes Tolbert, who later on joined the Bank&#13;
also. I think he is still with the Bank, Stokes Tolbert.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Heâ&#128;&#153;s retired now, but he was with them for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: So we had the good fortune of having these three people, very keen economic&#13;
analysts, I would say, very realistic view on things, and I think they enjoyed quite a&#13;
confidence from the leadership of their institutions to say things, to do things with us, and&#13;
in so doing make things really easier. Really in a decision with these three that the first&#13;
shapes of economic rehabilitation program was drafted, and with these three the first&#13;
attempts to renegotiate our debt obligations with our creditor countries, and really with&#13;
this three people the first steps toward the present IGGI [Inter-Governmental Group for&#13;
Indonesia], which is the inter-governmental group of aid to Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
I must say, in the beginning probably the Bank has not a very decisive role here. It was&#13;
really the Fund because our problems were really short-term, much of it are inflation,&#13;
much of it are balance of payments problems, so it was really with the Fund with whom&#13;
we are having financial negotiations. And only in 19â&#128;&#148;if Iâ&#128;&#153;m not mistakenâ&#128;&#148;in â&#128;&#152;68 that&#13;
the Bank really became more interested, and I think the first aid of the World Bank have&#13;
started somewhere in '71, if I'm not mistaken. And when problems of Indonesia have&#13;
shifted from short-term into the medium- and longer-term problems of development and&#13;
balance of payments problems become less and less urgent, then the World Bank reallyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;re dominant up â&#128;&#152;til now.&#13;
&#13;
I canâ&#128;&#153;t say thatâ&#128;&#153;s much [inaudible] I don't know what . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, that's very helpful, and it helps to fill out--we've had a picture that&#13;
certainly squares with that, so that you confirm some of what we've heard.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know how much you want to go right straight through, but one episode that we're&#13;
curious about comes up later when you were the governor, and it has to do with&#13;
Pertamina. We donâ&#128;&#153;tâ&#128;&#148;in a way the Bank was not associated, as far as we know, with the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Pertamina crisis,â&#128;&#157; so-called. But on the other hand we're kind of puzzled about that&#13;
because thereâ&#128;&#153;s this very strong and apparently effective macro policy dialogue going on&#13;
between the Bank and the Widjojo [Nitisastro] group right along with lots and lots of&#13;
exchange discussion of demand management, broadly speaking--finance, monetary. And&#13;
it would seem almost that the Bank should have been, once the oil shock came and one&#13;
knew that these greatly enhanced revenues were coming home and then could imagine&#13;
that that would increase one's creditworthiness to do a lot of borrowing, you'd think that&#13;
the Bank would have been more attentive to what was going on. Is that unreasonable?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I would picture things rather differently because really in the beginning of the&#13;
'70s--'71,'72--that is still within the first five-year plan period, and we stated that our first&#13;
five-year plan is really a rehabilitation program, that it's not much of a real development&#13;
program in terms of making large-scale investments and so on. We are interested, of&#13;
course, in rehabilitating irrigation, roads, and what not, but those are really in terms of&#13;
rehabilitation, not much new investments.&#13;
&#13;
When the first oil shock came and there were signs of sharply increasing foreign&#13;
exchange revenue for the country, the debate was really how to prioritize the utilization&#13;
of the extra gain. As I remember, of course, with the Fund we still have our standby&#13;
arrangements. With both institutions, really, the debate was about priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the so-called technocrats, Widjojo and group and so on, probably including myself,&#13;
from the beginning, of course, we know that we have to be careful about the utilization of&#13;
the extra gain, proper priorities and so on. But on the other hand, because this gain is in&#13;
an oil field, then you can imagine that Pertamina feels that they have a lot of say on how&#13;
to utilize the money when it comes really in terms of what the president will decide.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there has always been a feeling like that, that with the Bank things are slow, you&#13;
see. Decisions are quite slow. Preparations of projects has a long time. Maybe the&#13;
implementation is not that easy. Feelings like that, of course, was also present here in the&#13;
country. So when revenue started to come in, big gains, of course Pertamina and some of&#13;
the other people: â&#128;&#156;Why do we have to really rely on the World Bank? We have our own&#13;
money. Why don't we get things done sooner, quicker?â&#128;&#157; And by developing such a line,&#13;
priority in terms of true economic priority maybe takes a sideline, is on the sidelines. The&#13;
point is: â&#128;&#156;Think this is a good project? Of course letâ&#128;&#153;s do it. Itâ&#128;&#153;s good? Letâ&#128;&#153;s do it.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And you can imagine that in the beginning, my guess is that the president, being a&#13;
practical man and whom like everybody else would like, would prefer to see things get&#13;
done sooner and quicker, he was very impressed, of course, with the Pertamina rules until&#13;
people came to see how Pertamina implemented: not much learning, not much&#13;
prioritizing, until they more or less commit themselves to expenditures beyond what they&#13;
actually earned and start borrowing and so and the over-borrowing muck. There is not&#13;
much of system in doing and so on. There is not much, but--until they really get caught&#13;
in the kind of a situation where there was a real danger of not being able to honor interest&#13;
which are due, payments are due. They cannot roll over short-term debts, and that was&#13;
the time when the Pertamina crisis started. And I think we finally managed to convince&#13;
the president that we could not go on like that.&#13;
&#13;
Probably also indirectly being helped by a new posture of the World Bank. People&#13;
started to think, â&#128;&#156;Well, Indonesia is getting that much money, so no more I-D-A&#13;
[International Development Association] fund. Why always I-D-A fund? So now&#13;
Indonesia should be resorted into the normal funding of the World Bank,â&#128;&#157; and so on and&#13;
so on. And also, â&#128;&#156;Indonesia should learn, starting getting private capital, the private&#13;
capital market.â&#128;&#157; Talks like that have started during the period (that being also the&#13;
thinking on the part of the World Bank), but on the other hand seeing things how worked&#13;
&#13;
                                   Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                             November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
out as was done by Pertamina, they virtually mismanaged the whole thing. If that were to&#13;
continue, we would never have been able to really come into the market, to borrow in the&#13;
capital market at normal or reasonable rates.&#13;
&#13;
And the problem is also that has a kind of an effect because when we started to talk, I&#13;
mentioned to the president, he said, â&#128;&#156;Look, I think we have some revenue. It's a good&#13;
base. Of course there is assistance from the World Bank, Fund assistance, but there is&#13;
also an opportunity now to look into possibilities of raising money in the capital market,&#13;
private capital market, but we have to organize things.â&#128;&#157; And we were able to point out&#13;
how wrongly Pertamina did things. So we managed to [inaudible] Pertamina and so.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was all in â&#128;&#153;74?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: That was in '75, the so-called Pertamina crisis started in April, March or April&#13;
in '75.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did the Bank get interested, worry about the problems that same year or did&#13;
they stay on the sidelines?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: You see, discussions about unhappiness about how things were done by&#13;
Pertamina started as early as the start of the oil boom. We saw dangers in the way things&#13;
are done. We saw dangers in the way Pertamina committing itself and so on.&#13;
Talks like that has gone on for a while. The so-called Pertamina crisis is still here,&#13;
combination of . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were talking with the World Bank aboutâ&#128;&#148;and perhaps the Fund also&#13;
about . .&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Oh, I think during those period teams are coming on and off I don't know how&#13;
many times a year: World Bank team, Fund team, ADB [Asian Development Bank]&#13;
team. These kinds of things are [both speaking at once] all the time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So the World Bank was expressing worry?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I think that's fair to say; itâ&#128;&#153;s fair to say. The World Bank, the Fund, of course,&#13;
and also some of our creditor countries has mentioned, â&#128;&#156;Look, you cannot go on like&#13;
that.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is it fair to say that Pertamina had a separate and strong line to the president as&#13;
did the technocrat group, and then so for a time your concern wasn't able to register?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Well, there was something like a--people used to call it something like&#13;
competition, you see, between the Pertamina approach and the technocrats' approach.&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In these contacts with the Bank, were they always just conversations? Did this&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
sort of thing get written . . .&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Oh, I'm sure that there are notes, papers. Iâ&#128;&#153;m . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To the government or internal [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Well, let's put this way: sometimes at that time things are done not quite&#13;
officially. You don't write officially, for instance, to the minister of finance, but you give&#13;
a paper to Ali Wardhana. Now, how would you judge this: in his capacity as minister or&#13;
in a personal capacity? The point is that discussions did take place.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, Professor Widjojo told us about the phenomenon of â&#128;&#156;nonpapers.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Yeah. Sometimes Japanese use also another term: â&#128;&#156;talking papers.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#156;Talking papers.â&#128;&#157; We use that in the U.S. government, too, sometimes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The earlier episode of the late â&#128;&#152;60s in the resolution of the debt, did the Bank&#13;
have any role there or not really?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: When we go to meetings, there are always present the representatives of the&#13;
Fund and the World Bank. Normally we do discuss things with the Bank, the Fund,&#13;
thinking about what should be our proposal, what should be our thinking. Things like&#13;
that took place continuously since '66 onwards.&#13;
&#13;
The first meeting of rescheduling debts was in Japan before it was moved to Paris.&#13;
&#13;
When the IGGI was about to be formed, there was also a problem: who should chair it?&#13;
Certainly there was a good case of those who wants the Bank to chair it because, as I&#13;
remember also in the debt meeting problem, where I think it was the case of Ghana or&#13;
some African country because the World Bank was chairing certainly in the aid consortia&#13;
group what they were doing. So in our case also when we discussed who should chair&#13;
this aid meeting, there were wide proposals that the World Bank should chair it. But&#13;
finally, after much discussions and considerations and so on, the choice was Holland had&#13;
been asked to chair.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Why did the government resist the World Bank chairing it at that point?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Not the Indonesian government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Not the Indonesian government. There were those who think that this is an aid&#13;
group. In particular at that time contributions came particularly from governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                              November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right. There was no World Bank input much of that . .&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: World Bank input was very limited, maybe none in the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When did it start, IGGI?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: â&#128;&#152;68.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: â&#128;&#153;67.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: No, it was February â&#128;&#153;68â&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#153;67, yes, you are right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the Bank wasn't here at all at that point, actually. [Robert S.] McNamara&#13;
didn't make his visit until June of â&#128;&#152;68, and so they would meet you in these international&#13;
fora, but I can see then that . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Officially the government of Indonesia might not have yet even become a&#13;
member of the World Bank by that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They had resigned.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I don't quite remember when we rejoined the Fund and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah. Kemal Siber told us that he came here as the representative before you&#13;
had rejoined.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Yeah, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He was sent by Tun Thin.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: He came here really to feel, to have preliminary discussion why, what does the&#13;
Indonesian government think now, would the Indonesian government soon rejoin the&#13;
Fund and the Bank, preliminary discussions. So when he first came here certainly we&#13;
were not members of the Fund again.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Trade. Yeah, I think that--no, no, no, I think that's a good idea.&#13;
&#13;
We're interested in sort of following the role of the Bank vis-a-vis development strategy,&#13;
and one impression we have is that in terms of a expansionist as against a more&#13;
financially conservative strategy, the Fund, the Bank, and you were all together on quite a&#13;
conservative track. This is what the president wanted and this was reaction to your&#13;
inflationary experience earlier. In terms of the well-known thing among development&#13;
economists, import-substitution and export-oriented strategy, I presume that Indonesia&#13;
would be called a case of import substitution mainly for some time. The Bank was not all&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that focused on export promotion either, I think, in the early â&#128;&#152;70s, but at any rate at some&#13;
point the Bank did shift, and how that affected Indonesia would be interesting. When did&#13;
you change?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I think you are right. In the early â&#128;&#152;70s and even toward the latter part of the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;70s, so-called industrialization initiative is really import substitution. Now, the World&#13;
Bank, as I remember, its concentration was here on infrastructure. The point is how to&#13;
improve the infrastructure of the nation--roads, irrigation, ports and so on, electricity and&#13;
what not--not quite really about industrialization as such. So in that context I do not&#13;
remember a real pronounced policy on the part of the World Bank, how we will issue&#13;
industrialized country. So we did go on our own way. Of course, in the beginning&#13;
import substitution, and only later on toward the end of the â&#128;&#152;70s, when people came to&#13;
see that our industries have become very inefficient or remained inefficient because of&#13;
the too high taxments on, only toward the end of the â&#128;&#152;70s, I think the World Bank really&#13;
come up with this, â&#128;&#156;Now, look at the mistakes of some other countries. I think Indonesia&#13;
should be more outward-looking, faster in its industrialization,â&#128;&#157; and that started in â&#128;&#152;78,&#13;
â&#128;&#152;79, I think, â&#128;&#152;78.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And you were also receptive to that change?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Oh, quite certainly. As in the government itself, you see, even starting&#13;
probably in â&#128;&#152;77 there were those on the side of so-called departments of industry,&#13;
departments of agriculture, who tended more toward the so-called import substitution:&#13;
â&#128;&#156;We have to rely on a relatively big domestic marketâ&#128;&#157; and so on and so on. The more&#13;
monetary people like central bank, finance, and BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan&#13;
Pembangunan Nasional, National Development Planning Board] , they are more critical&#13;
about that. So even in the government itself opinions are not always unanimous, you&#13;
see?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true of many governments! Well, this is a case&#13;
where in this government finance and the planning ministry were together on these&#13;
things. Often that's not the case. Finance is conservative, and finance and the planners&#13;
are pushing physical expansion. But that was not the case.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Planning, because Widjojo was there, was . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And he was in charge of--he was the coordinating minister for that.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Then after this, in the early â&#128;&#152;80s, I guess, there was an unofficial Bank paper&#13;
on industrial restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Yeah, then I think starting early â&#128;&#152;80s, the official reports of the World Bank&#13;
really started to stress on the need of export, on outward-looking and so on, so really&#13;
early â&#128;&#152;80s things are starting.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I believe that were some differences between or maybe within the GOI&#13;
[Government of Indonesia] especially on credit policies. Is that true or not?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Not quite. What is predominant during those periods is the role of the so-&#13;
called technocrats, and the technocrats really are in the ministries of finance, central&#13;
bank, and BAPPENAS. So these are people who are not very keen about large-scale&#13;
credit expansion and so on. These are the more or less--a group with a more restrained&#13;
view on things. Those are the technocrats, and they are all in the ministry of finance,&#13;
central bank, and BAPPENAS.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You had this change of concern in Washington more or less parallel to your&#13;
change. Something similar happened in respect to financial issues [inaudible] monetary&#13;
policy. Do you remember how that worked in terms of the time off? Was there anything&#13;
like the equivalent [inaudible] for industry? What kinds of messages did you receive&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Those are the times when I was--I have always been with the central bank until&#13;
â&#128;&#152;83, so I quite remember how we felt and how we see things. When there is a change in&#13;
government in â&#128;&#153;65, in the late â&#128;&#152;60s or even the early â&#128;&#152;70s, there is really not much of a&#13;
banking industry in this country. Prior to â&#128;&#152;65 many experimentations have been done&#13;
about how we should organize our banking needs. Inflation was rampant. There is really&#13;
not much of a banking, bank areas, were there. So what we really wanted to achieve&#13;
during these years is to stabilize things and support individual banks so that they are free&#13;
of failures and help them getting themselves reorganized and start to really â&#128;&#156;put house in&#13;
order,â&#128;&#157; I would say. At that time it was unthinkable of having a liberal policy like now,&#13;
of using conventional monetary instruments or financial instruments, because things were&#13;
not understandable here. The liberalization of the banking industry which we were able&#13;
to do since â&#128;&#152;83 and more so since two or three years ago, that could take place because at&#13;
the time banks were all more or less ready. They are, have sufficient staffs, training&#13;
programs that have been done in the â&#128;&#152;70s, inflation was not there anymore so people they&#13;
start thinking in terms of real banking business, [inaudible] of credit--which was not&#13;
quite the case in the â&#128;&#152;50s or early â&#128;&#152;60s because of the interest.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In the â&#128;&#152;70s did the Bank [inaudible] accepting credit, national policy, or just&#13;
saying trade policy?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I would say so. You see . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Fund?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: The Fund, of course, was always preoccupied about domestic assets should not&#13;
increase too much, thereâ&#128;&#153;s the limit of domestic assets and so on, although our last&#13;
arrangement with the Fund was in â&#128;&#152;72, I think. Since then we don't have standby&#13;
arrangement anymore with the Fund although we plan ourselves with prior assistance&#13;
from the Fund, the Bank, how we should plan our monetary expansions, but we will have&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
no standby arrangement anymore with Fund. So in those days preventing of recurrence&#13;
of inflation has always been very strong, and that more or less sets the line on how&#13;
monetary policy should be conducted.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How independent is the central bank of the ministry of finance? Or is that sort&#13;
of redundant, the wrong question, because you are subject to the guidance of the&#13;
coordinating minister?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I became governor in â&#128;&#152;73. I think the minister of finance at the time was Ali&#13;
Wardhana. The coordinating minister was Widjojo. I think we have complete&#13;
confidence in what each of us are going to do. So we don't need to go very much in the&#13;
way of coordinating! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So you can coordinate without checking, huh?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you know each other before . .&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: We, of course, are graduates of the same school . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Berkeley.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: The faculty of economics here in Jakarta. Whereas Ali Wardhana and Widjojo&#13;
went on to Berkeley, I did not. I joined the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Widjojo and I are schoolmates, even from high school days, you see.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Really? My goodness. It's a small--it's a club!&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: That was, I think, a good fortune because we really came from the same&#13;
school. We more or less had the same ideas. We were playmates. So we know each&#13;
other. We trust each other. I think that makes things very much easier and no doubt&#13;
quite thrifty during those years.&#13;
&#13;
The president was really a man with a very open mind about economic policies. He&#13;
almost accept anything that were recommended by this group. That was, I think, really&#13;
the key factor in making things a success.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's really fascinating, and one still wonders now why did that happen that&#13;
way. Maybe because all you were recommending was right and he's a smart man!&#13;
[Laughter] He must--did he have some inclinations along the same lines himself, of sort&#13;
of financial conservatism?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I think it's really a matter of personal trust.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Personal trust.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: He really has great confidence in some of his assistants, Widjojo in particular,&#13;
that I really can mention. The president has such a great confidence in him that--and&#13;
Widjojo is a very careful man. He is not a man who will rush to a conclusion. He thinks&#13;
and rethinks, and so whatever recommendation comes from him, the president is sure that&#13;
it has been thought of very carefully. I think that was a big part.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did the president ever have much direct contact with the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: No, not--with the bank--the central or the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: With the World Bank, McNamara, vice-presidents . . .&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Of course, each time McNamara comes here or a senior member of the Bank&#13;
comes here, almost always they are making calls to the president, and they listen to&#13;
whatever he has to say.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What I was wondering is whether the president was influenced by the trust that&#13;
the Bank placed in Widjojo and yourselves.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: I think it was a definite understanding, what we made. The World Bank nor&#13;
the Fund would very rarely make their case directly to the president.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I meant, did he see that they trusted you? Did that influence him, or did that not&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: You mean that . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The president trusted you. Was that reinforced by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s trust in you?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Oh, no doubt. I think.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That helped to increase the president's trust?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Of course, once in a while things will take a different turn, you see. The&#13;
president may become critical about certain thinkings of the Fund or the Bank, but&#13;
everything--that's okay. We, of course, did our share in convincing the president that&#13;
this, this, this are quite good. And most of the times he will agree.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you recollect an example where this might not have been the case?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You mean when there was some conflict?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Well, in the beginning, right after the first oil boom when everybody was very&#13;
optimistic about going our own way, the World Bank and the Fund of course always&#13;
&#13;
                                 Rachmat Saleh&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
trying, you know: â&#128;&#156;Be careful not to overextend yourselves. Get your priorities right.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Well, sometimes the president, I'm sure, may have felt, â&#128;&#156;Why so tentative? Why not&#13;
more push?â&#128;&#157; Itâ&#128;&#153;s quite understandable, you see.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You've had some very rapid increase--well, your increase in non-oil exports&#13;
has picked up, I guess, roughly since oil prices declined in the early â&#128;&#152;80s. You were sort&#13;
of forced then to look more to other kinds of things. The rates of growth that I hear about&#13;
in the last two or three or four years have really been quite rapid. Is this a kind of&#13;
expansion that you see being extended, or is it a question of starting out from a very low&#13;
base and making a jump up, but it's going to be harder?&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: Well, of course, we started from quite a low base.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SALEH: But on a year-on-year basis we are still expanding since â&#128;&#152;86, I think, quite&#13;
well, you see. The future probably . .&#13;

            history program by John Lewis, Richard Webb, Devesh Kapur.
            This transcript concerns serious negotiations between

            Fund, to check inflation and later on how to start to
            rehabilitate the economy; the Bank’s concentration on
            infrastructure to improve the infrastructure of the nation -
            roads, irrigation, ports and so on, electricity.
