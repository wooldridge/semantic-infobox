ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the World Bank and the Donor, it being understood that any plural references in the annexes to&#13;
Donors, Administration Agreements, Contributions and pro rata shares shall be read as singular references to&#13;
the Donor, its Administration Agreement, its Contributions thereunder and the remaining uncommitted&#13;
balance of the Trust Fund, respectively.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The World Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the World Bank under its Articles of Agreement or&#13;
any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the World Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the World Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of&#13;
the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors&#13;
acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the World Bank under the anti-terrorist&#13;
financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country&#13;
that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the World Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the World Bank. The World Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the World Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the&#13;
World Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a&#13;
result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the World Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for&#13;
providing any additional financing.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the World Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the World Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The World Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the World Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;
trust funds administered by the World Bank. The World Bank shall credit all income from such investment&#13;
to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a one-time deduction from the funds in the&#13;
Trust Fund, an amount equal to and not greater than thirty-five thousand United States Dollars (US$35,000)&#13;
as a set-up fee for the Trust Fund upon receipt of funds in the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    The World Bank shall additionally deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions.  If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the World Bank reserves the&#13;
right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated&#13;
by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;
applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing&#13;
Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The World Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure&#13;
website.&#13;

comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the World Bank's external auditors&#13;
concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the World&#13;
Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the World Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the World&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the World Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The World Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the World Bank&#13;

Bank with respect to such audit, shall be bome by the requesting Donor.&#13;

limits of the World Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs&#13;
incurred by the World Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation&#13;
will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement: Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the World Bank&#13;
by December 31, 2017 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The World Bank shall only disburse funds deposited&#13;
in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such&#13;
date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the World Bank shall return any&#13;
remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its&#13;
respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as&#13;
Holding Currency amounts.&#13;

Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the World Bank shall&#13;
return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor&#13;
in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the&#13;
Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional terms that may be agreed between the World Bank and each&#13;
such Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The World Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust&#13;
Fund in accordance with the World Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such&#13;
related information.&#13;
