services in Chile using open innovation methodologies         were structured in a sequential order to allow each&#13;
that were first designed and implemented by the World         one to build upon the results and the community of&#13;
Bank in 2012-13 in Colombia (that is, in Barranquilla,        partners developed by the previous component. The&#13;
Cali, and Manizales). Although these methodologies            first component began with a small group of local and&#13;

&amp;#12;                         BOX 1: OPEN INNOVATION AND THE SMART CITY APPROACH&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Open innovation is a methodology to design and implement solutions or services collaboratively by integrating all stakeholders&#13;
   in a city (including public institutions, companies, academia, entrepreneurs, and citizens) in the service design process and&#13;
   its implementation. The result of these methodologies is a more targeted service solution (since the beneficiaries participate&#13;
   in the design process) and more active participations from citizens and other city stakeholders in service delivery and&#13;
   implementation (for example, citizens may become active service providers as opposed as passive receivers of city services).&#13;
   Introducing and implementing open innovation for city services combined with technology solutions is part of the bottom-up,&#13;
   smart city approach (as opposed to a top-down approach where technology solutions and service design and planning are&#13;
   imposed by the city government with little or no involvement of citizens).&#13;

the city government to expand open innovation to                       workshop was conducted in Santiago de Chile where the&#13;
&#13;
other sectors beyond transport. The second component                   results were presented and the scalability of the model&#13;
introduced city stakeholders, such as the private sector,              was discussed with MTT officials as well as with the&#13;
&#13;
universities, and civil society. The third component                   representatives of the regional government of Santiago&#13;

rapid prototypes to solve specific challenges faced in        with more than 20 public officials representing local&#13;
their work. Ultimately, the component served to identify      and municipal services with authority on transport&#13;
supporters among local and municipal officials who were       matters and other services that impact transport&#13;
willing to embrace the open innovation methodology            directly or indirectly (see Table 2). These interviews&#13;
that: i) would support the implementation of the activity     were not intended to diagnose issues with the transport&#13;
as active collaborators in the rest of components and         sector. Rather, the focus was to identify the challenges&#13;
interactions with the city stakeholders (for example,         that public officials face in their day-to-day work and&#13;
universities, entrepreneurs, private sector, civil society,   which would form the basis for the second phase. The&#13;
and so on); ii) would champion the introduction of these      challenges identified were both concrete issues that&#13;
methodologies in local and municipal services beyond the      could be addressed rapidly with existing technology&#13;
immediate project; and iii) would serve as role models for    solutions as well as more abstract ones that would&#13;
other local and municipal officials in Chile beyond Gran      require a more structured process to develop potential&#13;
ConcepciÃ³n and the transport sector.                          solutions. The challenges adopted in this component&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The following example shows the power for behavioral change of the identification of real challenges and&#13;
                   provision of rapid solutions that can be tested by the challenge providers.&#13;
&#13;
  The public officials of the traffic control center of Gran ConcepciÃ³n faced the constant challenge of having&#13;
  to react to traffic incidents and flows of traffic in the city with limited information for their decision-making.&#13;
  The city has a network of sensors and CCTVs. However, it is insufficient to cover the Gran ConcepciÃ³n&#13;
  area. CCTVs were particularly limited for an urban area of the size and population of Gran ConcepciÃ³n and&#13;
  did not cover much of the traffic infrastructure. Sensors were even more limited. As a result, the public&#13;
  officials from the traffic control center could not realize oft traffic congestions or incidences through their&#13;
  monitoring systems. Instead, and as reported by these officials, citizens suffering the traffic incidence&#13;
  would call the local radio broadcaster news service (Radio BioBio) to complain, which would, in turn, call&#13;
  the local politician responsible for traffic management in the area and demand responsibilities through&#13;
  live broadcasting. Understandably, this caused tension through the command chain, with an urgent call&#13;
  for fixing the incidence. This was reported to be a very stressful situation by the traffic control officials,&#13;
  who had to physically displace to where the incidence was happening to understand how to respond&#13;
                                        while pressed for urgent solutions.&#13;
&#13;
  The concept of technology solution developed to address this challenge was a Citizen Reporting App&#13;
  (mobile application) whereby citizens could report directly traffic incidences through their phones with&#13;
  automatic geolocation. This reporting would feed the traffic control centerâ&#128;&#153;s dashboard in real time. This&#13;
  concept was co-developed by the traffic officials and the Bank and MTT team. In order to demonstrate&#13;
  how this app would work and what kind of information the dashboard would show in practice, the team&#13;
  developed a rapid prototyping using an Android phone and open software for geolocation and reporting.&#13;
  The prototype was then demonstrated in real-time to these officials, which could use it and see how&#13;
  it would work in practice to address their problem. After this demonstration, the public officials that&#13;
  participated in this workshop from the traffic control team became champions of the activity throughout&#13;
               the process and beyond (through the Ministry of Transport strategy â&#128;&#147; see above).&#13;

The objective of this component was to build consensus             stakeholders were interviewed (see Table 4) to identify&#13;
among government and city stakeholders and develop                 the current use of technology solutions to support local&#13;
a common vision to introduce open innovation                       and municipal transportation services as well as available&#13;
methodologies in municipal governments. The                        databases currently in use to support these services. As&#13;
component was developed in March 2014 through two                  a result, an inventory was created of databases and data&#13;
parallel activities: i) a diagnosis of the use of technology in    sets available for potential use by developers in creating&#13;
local and municipal transport services; and ii) a foresight        technology solutions to support transport local and&#13;
exercise to develop a common vision and roadmap                    municipal services. This information was applied to the&#13;

       DESPIERTA: HOW AN OPEN INNOVATION PROCESS CAN SOLVE PUBLIC&#13;
             SERVICES CHALLENGES WITH UNEXPECTED INGENUITY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Despierta is one of the two concepts of technology solutions that won the MueveTT competition. It&#13;
  was developed by a team of students from the local universities with the aim of improving the travel&#13;
                           experience in Gran ConcepciÃ³n public transportation.&#13;
&#13;
  In Gran ConcepciÃ³n, the main mean of public transportation is the micro-bus, a fleet small busses that&#13;
  follow routes around the conurbation. This micro-buses are managed by private companies, which have a&#13;
  concession for a specific routes. Although the micro-buses follow a route, there are no formal stops, and&#13;
  the bus can be hail in any point through its route. To request the bus to stop, passengers request verbally&#13;
                                       the driver to stop where needed.&#13;
&#13;
  The initial concept of Despierta, as conceived by the team at the ideation part of the competition, was&#13;
  a mobile app whereby the user could set the geolocation of the destination through a user-friendly map&#13;
  interface (e.g., google maps) for the mobile phone to alert the user via an alarm 200 meters before arriving&#13;
  destination. The thought behind it related to the personal experience of the teamâ&#128;&#153;s members using Gran&#13;
  ConcepciÃ³n micro-buses. As a university town, students are one of the main users of the micro-buses&#13;
  in the conurbation. When going to classes in the morning, it is often the case that students get slept on&#13;
  route, missing their stop and needing to wait for the micro-bus to finish the route and come back to arrive&#13;
                          to the missed destination. The app aimed to solve this issue.&#13;
&#13;
  The Bank team, together with the local and municipal government officials serving as mentors in the&#13;
  competition, worked closely with the competition teams to help them in developing their concepts and&#13;
  maximize social impact to support the public goals behind the competition challenges (see Box 2). This&#13;
  support has the form of suggestions and ideas within the ideation and brainstorming process of the&#13;
  competition teams. Within this process, the Bank team suggested to the Despierta team to consider&#13;
  the disabled blind population as a target for this mobile app concept. The team responded positively,&#13;
  and expanded their initial concept for the mobile app to include specific features for the disabled blind&#13;
  population. The final concept of the app that was presented to the final and that won the competition was&#13;
  designed for the disabled blind population. The mobile app would allow a blind person to ask the phone&#13;
  via verbal instructions to alert her when the micro-bus is arriving to hail it, and then program the phone to&#13;
  alert via a sound alarm of the proximity (200 meters) of the destination to request the micro-bus to stop.&#13;
&#13;
  With this design, Despierta become an ingenious solution to address a public service gap in the public&#13;
  transportation infrastructure in Gran ConcepciÃ³n, which could not be access by the disabled blind&#13;
  population. Instead of the traditional solutions applied to make the public infrastructure applied to&#13;
  disabled blind population (e.g., braille signaling, physical signaling in pavement and bus stops, etc.) a&#13;
  team of students-entrepreneurs provided a quick solution that can be scaled up rapidly through the&#13;
  whole public transportation infrastructure of the conurbation with no cost to the local and municipal&#13;
  government. Furthermore, as a startup, this solution would also create entrepreneurship and be a source&#13;
                                                of employment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  Although there is no common definition of an innovation hub, this concept can be applied to define the evolution of&#13;
  collaboration spaces into community managers that coordinate or integrate many of the other functions of collaboration&#13;
  spaces such as coworking spaces, maker spaces, fablabs, accelerators, living labs, and urban labs (see source below for&#13;
  description of these spaces). Innovation hubsâ&#128;&#153; main function is to coordinate all actors of the ecosystem and help manage the&#13;
  community of tech-innovators and entrepreneurs to grow sustainably. Many of these innovation hubs enjoy the participation&#13;
  of the most relevant actors of the technology innovation ecosystem, including entrepreneurs, universities, private sector,&#13;
  collaboration spaces, accelerators, incubators, other providers of seed capital, community managers, and government â&#128;&#148;&#13;
  particularly city government. Some of these innovation hubs have collaboration spaces in their facilities, such as co-working&#13;
  and maker spaces, while others coordinate their functions with those spaces. Typically, these hubs will phase out their&#13;
  other functions when there are enough offerings for the community provided by third parties. Examples vary from Ruta N,&#13;
  Medellin (which is part of the city government), to NUMA in Paris (which is a grass-root hub built with the community of local&#13;
  entrepreneurs), with Forum Virium, Helsinki, as a middle point (a PPP model owned 50 percent by the city and 50 percent&#13;
  by the ecosystemâ&#128;&#153;s stakeholders). Citilab, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Waag Society, Amsterdam, and Urban Lab, Barcelona, are&#13;
  other examples of innovation hubs. The World Bank designed and implemented the innovation hub model in the Lebanon:&#13;
  Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project (MIEP). This is the model applied to this activity. (For more details of such model see the&#13;
  Project Document).&#13;

This provided inputs for their guidance and facilitation             hubs from the international examples supporting&#13;
during the workshop.                                                 the workshop addressed each of these topics. The&#13;
                                                                     participants were randomly assigned to four groups&#13;

  MTT approved the Smart City Strategy embracing the smart city bottom-up approach implemented in&#13;
        Smart City Gran ConcepciÃ³n and calling for its implementing this model at national level.&#13;
&#13;
  Following the strategy, the Smart City Unit has been implementing open innovation competitions in six&#13;
  regions (Temuco, Puerto Montt, ConcepciÃ³n, Antofagasta, Coquimbo and Valparaiso) under the MueveTT&#13;
          brand and open innovation methodology developed under Smart City Gran ConcepciÃ³n.&#13;
&#13;
  CORFO developed the Regional Strategic Smart City program with the Metropolitan Region of Santiago&#13;
  de Chile to implement the bottom-up smart city model to Santiago de Chile. This program follows the&#13;
  MoU MTT-Regional Metropolitan Government to support the development of the bottom-up smart city&#13;
        model in Santiago that was signed in the Results Workshop of Smart City Gran ConcepciÃ³n.&#13;
&#13;
  The Regional Metropolitan Government of Santiago created the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness&#13;
  together with the MTT to develop open innovation methodologies with the universities of Santiago to&#13;
                develop regional technological platforms and support the Smart City model.&#13;
&#13;
  CONYCIT developed an initiative to link university research and private sector companies to develop&#13;
  technology solutions to support the smart city model following open innovation and collaboration models&#13;
                             in part inspired by Smart City ConcepciÃ³n activity.&#13;
&#13;
  Chileâ&#128;&#153;s GovLab, in collaboration with the Smart City Unit of MTT, is working on three government&#13;
  challenges in the area of transport (out of a total of 10 government challenges) following open innovation&#13;
   and co-creation methodologies. These challenges are related to Smart City Gran ConcepciÃ³n activity.&#13;
&#13;
  As a results of the skills and knowledge gained through the Smart City Gran ConcepciÃ³n activity (see&#13;
  below) the Smart City Unit of MTT work program include: i) catalyzing PPPs and government funds to&#13;
  develop open innovation processes for public goals, and ii) catalyze the entrepreneurship ecosystem&#13;
  through universities, promoting the development of open innovation competition and supporting their&#13;
                                             implementation.&#13;

    There is no municipality of ConcepciÃ³n or Santiago de Chile. These â&#128;&#156;citiesâ&#128;&#157; (also called â&#128;&#156;conurbationsâ&#128;&#157;) are formed by an&#13;
amalgamation of municipalities (that is, over 10 in ConcepciÃ³n and over 30 in Santiago de Chile). The Regional Government (which is&#13;
considered part of the central government) has overarching authority and the role of coordinator among municipalities.&#13;

            Smart City Gran Concepción is a World
            Bank Technical Assistance activity to support more efficient
            municipal and local public services in Chile that leverage
            technology (information and communications technology, ICT)
            and social entrepreneurship (that is, a bottom-up smart city
            model). It was conducted in Gran Concepción, the second
            largest urban area in Chile, between November 2013 and
            October 2014. Smart City Gran Concepcion followed four
            components: 1) a codesign workshop on technology solutions
            for local and municipal challenges in the transport sector,
            2) diagnosis, vision and a roadmap to support open
            innovation and technology solutions for local and municipal
            services, 3) a competition for cocreation of technology
            solutions for transport challenges and 4) a cocreation
            workshop for a strategic plan for the development of a local
            innovation hub. The activity had a threefold impact: 1) it
            achieved its objectives in Gran Concepción and proved the
            methodology to be effective; 2) it catalyzed the adoption of
            the bottom-up smart city model following this new
            methodology throughout Chile; and 3) it expanded the
            implementation and mainstreaming of the methodologies
            developed and tested through this activity in other Bank projects.
