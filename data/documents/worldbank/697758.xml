MESSAGE FROM THE&#13;
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
I am pleased to report continued improvement in MIGA's operating results and profit-&#13;
ability in fiscal 1995. To a considerable degree, MIGA owes its excellent results to Lewis T.&#13;
Preston, who was MIGA's President until his death in May.&#13;
Compared to many other development institutions, MICA is still a small organization.&#13;
However, our small size - and that of some of the investments we assist - should not be equated&#13;
with insignificance. We have found that even small investments can have a significant devel-&#13;
opmental impact and that equity investments, in particular, often have large multiplier effects.&#13;
Demand for all of MICA's&#13;
services is surging. To respond&#13;
effectively, management will&#13;
need to redouble its efforts.&#13;
MICA's new President, James D.&#13;
Wolfensohn, has already evi-&#13;
denced a keen interest in our ca-&#13;
pabilities and an appreciation of&#13;
the important role MICA can&#13;
play in the Bank Group's efforts&#13;
to promote the growth of the&#13;
private sector in our member&#13;
cotintries. In the coming years,&#13;
we look forward to addressing&#13;
the challenges of capacity&#13;
growth.&#13;

LETTER TO THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNORS&#13;
June 30, 1995&#13;
On behalf of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the bylaws of the Multilateral Invest-&#13;
ment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), James D. Wolfensohn, President of MIGA and Chairman of its&#13;
Board of Directors, submits this report and auditedfinancial statements for thefiscal year ending June 30,&#13;
1995, to the Council of Governors.&#13;
The Board is pleased to report that MIGA has had an excellent year during which its insurance&#13;
and investment promotion services grew impressively. MIGA has successfully pursued the objectives set&#13;
out in the Convention, thus supplementing the activities of the other members of the World Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
The Board of Directors would like to express its appreciation for the outstanding leadership that&#13;
the late Lewis T. Preston provided to MIGA from September 1, 1991, until his untmely death. During&#13;
that period, the number of member countries nearly doubled and the volume of insurance business&#13;
trebled. Mr. Preston's guidance and experience will be missed.&#13;

national economies (some far removed from      developing countries were actually negative in&#13;

These volatile capital flows underscored the   mnore so for 1994. Most new lending by banks&#13;

attract suchI investment. Yet, some countries  create internationally competitive facilities. As&#13;
have approached external investors warily,     international corporations pursue their long-&#13;
while others have pursued them avidly. Some    term strategies under these circumstanices, such&#13;

Statement of Agency Purpose&#13;
The Multilateral Investmenit Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group. The Agency is designed to help developinrz cotintries atrract&#13;
productive foreign investmenit by both private investors and commercially operated public sector&#13;
companies. Its facilities inchicle gularantees or insuranice against nonicommercial risks and a&#13;
program ot consultative anSd advisory services to promote improvements in member cou1ntries&#13;
environments tor foreign investmeit.&#13;
Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity *-ith International AccOuLntilng&#13;
Standards. In the absence of sLIcIstandalrds, then, subject to relevant legal requiremenits, the policy&#13;
adlopted is that considered most appropriate to the circuLIMstaces of MIGA having regard to the&#13;
accountingpriinciples usedi in the United States and the practices of other international insurance&#13;
entities. The following suLImmary of policies azdopted by MIGA is provided t o assist readers in the&#13;
interpretation of these financial statemeits. The accouinting policies followed are consistent in all&#13;
material respects with generally accepted accouLntin)g principles in the United States.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's firiancial statements are expressed in rerms of lnited States dollars solely for the ptirrose&#13;
ot summarizzing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations lfor the convenience of&#13;
its mem1bers and other interested parties.&#13;
MI1GA is an international organization that may condluct its operations in the currencies of Al its&#13;
members. MIGA's resources are derived fromil its capital and retained earnings in its members'&#13;
currencies. MIGA strives tto minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency environment. A,&#13;
sucIh MIGA attempts to match its contingent oblioationIs in any (one curreicy with assets in the&#13;
same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis ro march&#13;
the currencies uLndertyinlg its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The purpose of&#13;
these conversions will be to miinimi-ze currency exposure that may ocCul througLh operatiois.&#13;
Otherwise, MIGA will n1ot convert one currency into another except ttor ssmall amounts required&#13;
to meet certaill operational needs-&#13;
Assets anId liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
sUbscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedUres described below. Income and expenses&#13;
are generall1 translatedI at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.&#13;
Translation adjUistments are charged Or credited to retained earnings.&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
UnJer the MIGA Convention, all payments from0  members subscribing to the capital stock of&#13;
MIGA shall be settledl on the basis of the average Value of the SDR in terms ofUtliited States dollars&#13;
for the periodJaMnary 1, 1981 tojune 30, 1985. such valLie leilg equal to $1.0827 for one SR. The&#13;
Convenition further states that ten percenit of the members' shares he paid in cash, in frcely&#13;
46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
convertible cUrrencies, except that developing member couIntries may pay up to a quarter of the&#13;
ten percent In their own cirrencies. In adidition, another ten percent of the members' shares shall&#13;
be paid in the torm  of nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing promilissory notes. The notes are&#13;
denominated in freely convertible cuirrencies andl are d&lt;ue on demand to meet the Agencv's&#13;
obligations. The policies relating to translationL of currenicies as describeL above also apply to thIe&#13;
cash and the promissory n otes paid in.&#13;
Investments&#13;
Management has both the abilitv and Intent to hold all investments to maturity. AccordingIl,&#13;
MICGA's investmeit holdings are carried at cost or amortl:ed cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenitie from premiulm pamenllts for direct Insurance and reinISUrance contracts assumed and&#13;
ceded is recognized on a pro-rata hasis over the contract Period. Rexenrie from commitment fees,&#13;
whichi are fee.s paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee capacity for future&#13;
uise, is recog,niz-ed on a pro-rata hasis ox-er the commiit menit period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for losses ilnerent in gu(1arnitee operations based upon claim&#13;
sLibmissions, consideration of loss experienices by insurers engalged in similar underwritings, and&#13;
other factorS includidig changes in the composition andl v olum-1e of the Insuiraince and outstandin.g&#13;
guIarantees anl wvorldwide economic and political conditions. This reserve is available to absorb&#13;
losses related to Insurance amounts outstainidilng, which are oft-balance sheet commaitments. The&#13;
reserve is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased for claims settlements.&#13;
The periodic provision for claims IS uSually based on management's evaluation of potential claim&#13;
payimients (net of expected recoveries) thait may resuilt from  (i) risks that are inherenit, Lut&#13;
ULilldeltifiable at the time of Writing; (il) tinisualIV large concentrations ot exposure in indiVidual&#13;
risks, COU1ntries or guiarantee contracts; and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MICA's expected&#13;
recoverv r ates onl its total portfolio. However, given the lack of histor1ical claims exiperience in&#13;
MICA, there Is no actuarial or historic;l basis uploll XwhIch to determine the Agency's expected&#13;
claims experience. Accordingly, management, with the approval of the Board, relies on a&#13;
1premium-based methodology for establis,hing the reserxve for claims.&#13;
Recognizing the fact that duringg the early ye ars of the Agency'ยฐ operatirions when its cash rcserves&#13;
are small in relationl to its obligations asuLimed ULinder its inrLIanIce activities and When there is&#13;
limited history for estimationi of losses, it is iinderstoi d, in accordance with the provisions of the&#13;
Convention, that thc prom01issory note portion of the subscr ibed capital wNoulld be utiliZedi to pay&#13;
any% claims In excess of the cash reserve. In tlhis context, member capital remains sLuject to direct&#13;
risk. Considering the absence of historical claims experience, this risk; is difficu[lt to assess.&#13;
However, it should be noted that Under an extreme hvpothetical claims scenario, this risk could&#13;
he considerable.&#13;
Acquisition Costs&#13;
Costs of acquiring investiment inISUrance bIusineess are expensed in the ye;ir incurred, as such&#13;
arIOLIntS are ivot iiateriil.&#13;

Note D: Guarantee Program and Contingent Liabilities&#13;
Giucmirtee Prorpam. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss causeld by noncommercial&#13;
risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors oln qualified investments in developing member&#13;
coLintries. MIGCA insures Investments for up to 20 years against four different categories of risk:&#13;
currelncV tralsifer, expropriation, war and ci\il disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency&#13;
transter protects the inv\estortfrom inconvertibility of local currency returns and proceeds froim the&#13;
liquidition of the investment project Into toreign exchange for tranisfer outside the host country.&#13;
Expropriation protects the investor against partial or total loss Of the insured investment as a result&#13;
of acts by the host government which mav redIuce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights&#13;
to the iusured investienit. War and civil disturbance protects the investor against losses from&#13;
damaoe to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivatedl&#13;
acts of war or civil disturibance in the host country&gt; Breaich of contract protects the investor against&#13;
the impossibility to obtain or to enforce an arbitral or ju.ldicial decision recogni:ing the breach of&#13;
an obligation by the host government. Investors may insure projects for any comibination of the four&#13;
ty pes of coverage. MICGA g uarantees, othier than those issueId as r einsuraince, cannot be terminated&#13;
u1nilaterally by the guarantee holdter within the tirst three \ears from the date of Issuance. Premiiium&#13;
rates applicable to issuedL contracts are fixed for five years- Payments against all claims under a&#13;
guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issuel Utnder the guarantee.&#13;
On Fehruary 8, 1994, the Council of Governors approved a resolution increasing the maximLium&#13;
aglgregate amoun.t of conitingent liabilities that mav be assumlieed by the Agencv from 150 percent&#13;
to 350 percent (risk-to-asset ratio) of the sum of the Agenacy's ulnimpaired subscribed carpital and&#13;
Its reserves plus sucICh p rtion of the insurance cededl by the Agencx' through contracts of&#13;
reinsiranice as the Board of Directors may determine. Such increase w as to be accomplished in two&#13;
stages: ( i) an increase to 250 percent shall he effective immediaitely (accordlinglV, at J]une 30, 1995,&#13;
the maximumi level Of guarantees outstanding couldd not exceedl 52,702, 160,000) and (ii) an&#13;
increase to 350 percent ik to be considerel by the Boar olt Directtors once the sum o f the Agency s&#13;
actual level of contingent liabilities anld commitmenIts plus those aproposed contracts which the&#13;
Agency may assuLIme will go forward based on the operations approved by, or concurred with, thr&#13;
Board of Director-s has reached 240 percent of the suLIM of the Agency's utnimpaired subscribed&#13;
capital and Its reserves plus sucIh Portion of the insurance ceded by the AC'encv as the Board ot&#13;
Director-s may determine.&#13;
Subsequient to jtine 30, 1995, the Audidt Comllllmittee of the Board of Directors coIncUrred with&#13;
Maniagemilenit'S diecISisIo tO reqtiest the Board of Dinectors' concurrence to increase the risk-to-asset&#13;
ratio froim 2 50 percenit to 350 percent. Tlils increase IS expectedl to be conCurred by the Board of&#13;
Directors early in fiscal year 1 996.&#13;
Contingent Licbilin'. The miaximuiI amoiunt of contingent liability of N'IIGA undier gualantees&#13;
insuedL andi outstalnlding at Junle 30, 1995 totaled $1,622,892,000 ($1,048,335,000 - 1994). The&#13;
MaxiMiLm amount of contingent liability is \ICGA's miaxinum  expostire to insurance claims,&#13;
which incltudes "standby" coverage for wvhich MICA is comm11l1itted hilt n()t currently at risk. At&#13;
June 30, 1995, MIGA's estima1te of its "aCtual CXpOSUIe to insuainCe ClilmS eXClusivie ot standby&#13;
coverage is $1,150,156,000. At June 30, 1995, approximately 86.4 percent of the contingent&#13;

Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
Claim Activity. As of Jute 30, 1995, there have been no claims lodged with the Agency. However,&#13;
the Agency has been informed of two dispLites betweeni investors and host governments related to&#13;
insured projects even though no claims have been filed. These disputes are in preliminary stages&#13;
and the Agency believes that these disputes will not have material adverse effects on the Agency's&#13;
financial position.&#13;
Note E: Other Matters&#13;
Service and Suipport Fee. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)&#13;
charges the Agency an annual Service and Support Fee, which for the fiscal year ended June 30,&#13;
1995, amounted to $700,000 ($685,000 - 1994).&#13;
StaffRetirement Plan. The IBRD has adefinedb enefit retirement plan (Plan) covering substantially&#13;
all of the staff of the Agency, the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Under&#13;
the Plan, benefits are based on years of service and average compensation, with the staff&#13;
contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable remunerationi, and the Agency, the IBRD and IFC&#13;
contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan benefits. The total&#13;
contribution is based upon the aggregate finding method. All contributions to the Plan and all&#13;
other assets and income held for the purposes of the Plan are held by the IBRD separately from the&#13;
other assets and income of the Agency, the IBRD and IFC and can be used only for the benefit of&#13;
the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries until all liabilities to them have been paid or&#13;
provided for. The total expense allocated to the Agency for the fiscal year endedjune 30, 1995 was&#13;
$907,000 ($790,000 - 1994).&#13;
Other Post Emnployment Beniefits. The IBRD also provides certain life insurance and medical benefits&#13;
to substantially all retired staff of the Agency, the IBRD and IFC and their spouses through&#13;
contributions to a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP). Commencing in 1990, the Agency, the&#13;
IBRD and IFC began accruing and funding, on an actuarially determined basis, the expected&#13;
future costofproviding such benefits fotrfuture retirees. All contributions to the RSBP and all other&#13;
assets and income held for purposes of the RSBP are helcl separately from the other assets and&#13;
incoime of the Agency, the IBRD and IFC and can be used only for the benefit of the participants&#13;
in the RSBP and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. The&#13;
total expense allocated to the Agency for the fiscal year encded June 30, 1995 was $208,000&#13;
($186,000- 1994).&#13;
Contribution to Special Progran. This represents grants to the Foreign Investment Advisory Service&#13;
(FIAS), which was established to assist developing countries to improve their policies, programs&#13;
and institutions that relate to foreign direct investment. FIAS was establisheld by IFC in 1986, and&#13;
became a jointly managed program of IFC and MIGA in November 1988. Effective July 1, 1994,&#13;
the Agency withdrew from the FIAS joint venture in accordance with the recommendation&#13;
approved by MIGA's Board of Directors on February 25, 1994.&#13;
Note F: Estimated Fair Values&#13;
The estimated fair values of the Agency's cash and nonnegotiable. noninterest-bearinig demand&#13;
obligations are assumecd to approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value of the&#13;
Agency's investments shown in Note B is based on market quotations due to their short term&#13;
nature. The estimated fair values are onily indicative of individual financial instruments' values anid&#13;
should not be considered an indication of the fair v alue of the Agency.&#13;

President and Board of Governors&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 40 through 51 of this Report&#13;
present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial&#13;
position of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) at June 30, 1995 and&#13;
1994, and the results of its operations and its caslh flows for the years then ended in&#13;
conformity with International Accounting Standards and with generally accepted ac-&#13;
countinig principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility&#13;
of management of MIGA; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial&#13;
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accor-&#13;
dance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Standards on&#13;
Auditing, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assur-&#13;
ance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit&#13;
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in&#13;
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates&#13;
maade by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We&#13;
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;
Note D discusses MIGA's guarantee program and recent and proposed increases in the&#13;
maximum aggregate amount of resultant contingent liabilities that may be assumed by&#13;
MIGA. As more fully discussed in Note A under Reserve for Claims, given the lack of&#13;
historical claims experience, MIGA relies on a premium-based methodology for establish-&#13;
ing the reserve for claims and, in accordance with the MIGA Convention, the promissory&#13;
demand note portion of the subscribed capital would be utilized to pay any claims in&#13;
excess of the cash reserve (defined as reserve for claims plus retained earnings). In this&#13;
context, the absence of historical and actuarial claims experienice subjects member capital&#13;
to direct risk which, under an extrem e adverse claims scenario, could be considerable.&#13;
