ANNEX A&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF IFC ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES UNDER THE IFC&#13;
DONORS' TRUST FUND (TF071867)&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to, and form an integral part of, all agreements entered into between IFC,&#13;
the Bank and entities that provide contributions (collectively, the "Donors") (the aggregate of all&#13;
contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by IFC for the IFC Donors' Trust&#13;
Fund (TFO71867).&#13;
IFC Activities will cover tax simplification, business regulations and indicator based reform&#13;
advisory.&#13;
The activities described below will contribute to the following expected results:&#13;
Ultimate outcome: Increased competitiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean region.&#13;
Intermediate outcomes:&#13;
*  Improved regulatory and administrative frameworks and processes for doing business in selected&#13;
participating countries;&#13;
*  Increased efficiency and transparency in business entry procedures and licensing regimes in&#13;
selected participating countries;&#13;
*  Enhanced efficiency and inclusiveness of tax regimes in participating countries.&#13;
I      Tax Simplification&#13;
The Tax Simplification Program is divided into 2 phases: During the first 2 years the program will focus&#13;
on supporting the implementation of reform in business taxation with 3 key pillars:&#13;
*  Undertake key diagnostics of tax compliance burdens and administrative efficiencies to inform a&#13;
tax simplification program;&#13;
*  Simplify key tax administration processes for businesses;&#13;
*  Simplify tax regimes for MSMEs with the aim to reduce their compliance costs to encourage&#13;
voluntary compliance and deter rent-seeking by the tax administration.&#13;
During this first phase, this program component will focus on the following core activities, geared to&#13;
conduct benchmarking exercises to both assess and develop baselines for key indicators of reform&#13;
outcomes and provide inputs into the design of a business tax simplification design:&#13;
a) Conduct compliance cost surveys to determine the time and financial costs of compliance (and&#13;
non-compliance) with tax procedures;&#13;
b) Carry out process mapping studies to complement the compliance cost survey to determine where&#13;
the bottlenecks in the tax processes lie;&#13;
c) Analyze compliance cost survey and process mapping studies to identify key issues and areas of&#13;
focus for reform of taxpayer facing processes;&#13;
d) Make recommendations for reform of tax processes and administration to reduce compliance cost&#13;
for taxpayers and save time/cost of administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
e) Design special, simplified tax regime for small and micro businesses. Determine needed changes&#13;
in tax laws, procedures, rules, forms and systems. Redraft tax laws, as required, to support the&#13;
new regime;&#13;
f) Develop communications strategy including promotion and information campaigns for MSMEs;&#13;
g) Strengthen E-governance: Support the implementation of e-filing, e-payment, and e-services&#13;
programs of the tax administration pertaining to business taxpayers;&#13;
h) Design "one-stop" tax service centers for small business.&#13;
Program Activities in the second phase of the program, at the end of the first two years, will focus on&#13;
rationalizing region-wide tax incentives and avoiding harmful tax competition. Planned activities:&#13;
a) Review of current incentives regime in each country, both per laws as well as per practice;&#13;
b) Estimations of foregone tax revenues, where needed;&#13;
c) Conduct investor motivation surveys to understand key drivers of investment and role of tax&#13;
incentives in attracting investment;&#13;
d) Carry out cost-benefit analyses in the countries to assess the effectiveness of tax incentives&#13;
e) Design a set of policy guidelines on tax incentives;&#13;
f) Organize several regional workshops and conferences on the issue of tax incentives to share best&#13;
practices;&#13;
g) Attempt to agree on a common regional policy and framework on tax incentives.&#13;
During :oth phases of the tax simplification program, the IFC team will closely coordinate and involve&#13;
the W rld Bank team (in particular the LAC Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network&#13;
team) ir the delivery of the work to ensure full consistency and coordination with the World Bank&#13;
engage::nents in the tax area in the LAC region.&#13;
II     Business Regulation&#13;
The BuSiness Regulation Program is divided into 2 components: Business Entry and Construction Permits&#13;
and Gr,.en Building Regulations.&#13;
Business Entry:&#13;
a) Consolidation and strengthening Regional Network of Public Registrars for Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean (ASORLAC for its acronym in Spanish): Created on April 2010 under the&#13;
initiative of the IFC with the support of Colombia's Chamber of Commerce of Bogota, the&#13;
Regional Network of Public Registrars for Latin America and the Caribbean will promote the&#13;
exchange of good practices in the reform to start a business. To consolidate the network, IFC will&#13;
hire a team of professionals to enhance the dynamism of this network as well as to promote and&#13;
manage all activities..&#13;
b) Coordination of knowledge sharing meetings: Activities of knowledge sharing at the regional&#13;
level are essential to provide to senior officials in charge of the public registrars a space to&#13;
interact, share experiences and solidify partnerships. The program plans to have one annual&#13;
meeting to present the progress accomplished by ASORLAC as well as to highlight the plans for&#13;
future activities. The program expects to coordinating 3 annual events in the next 3 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 10 -&#13;
c) Harmonization of Business Entry Reforms for regional regulatory convergence: Once&#13;
ASORLAC has a team to organize knowledge sharing activities, it is envisioned that this staff&#13;
would manage the following tasks:&#13;
i)  Identification of potential regulatory synchronicities to detect opportunities for knowledge&#13;
exchange&#13;
ii)  Coordination of consultancies to promote concrete and specific reforms:&#13;
iii) Promote working virtual tables around key topics for reform: ASORLAC team will promote&#13;
the exchange of good practices around key topics for reform including: one stop shops, the&#13;
role of notaries, legal reforms, and inspections. The exchange of information could be&#13;
accomplished virtually or as part of the consultancies.&#13;
Construction Permits and Green Building Regulations&#13;
Activities for the Construction Permits and Green Building Regulations include:&#13;
a) Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing activities: The knowledge sharing activities that will be&#13;
planned around this component will be accomplished through the creation of specific working&#13;
tables around particular reforms that have had a positive impact in a country. These activities&#13;
could include specific workshops on key subject areas such as construction permit, ICTs, and&#13;
inspection of constructions. In addition, the regional peer-to-peer knowledge sharing could be&#13;
accomplished through the exchange of consultants identified by IFC.&#13;
b) Mapping for Green Building Regulations: Leveraging on the vast amounts of information&#13;
WBG local offices have collected on the regulatory framework of construction permits, WBG&#13;
Activities will expand on this knowledge and conduct mapping studies on the GBC execution&#13;
potential in chosen countries. These mapping studies will provide with the background and&#13;
framework to identify the opportunities to implement the GBC in these countries.&#13;
III    Indicator Based Reform Advisory (IBRA) Activities&#13;
The Indicator Based Reform Advisory component is composed of two main groups of Activities:&#13;
Activities at the national level in each participating country, and Activities at the regional and sub-&#13;
regional levels aimed for the LAC region as a whole.&#13;
a)  Activities at the national level:&#13;
The IBRA technical assistance will be organized as follows:&#13;
i. Prepare a reform memorandum.&#13;
The reform memorandum for each country will outline country performance on the Doing Business&#13;
report and possibly other relevant indicators (e.g. Women, Business and the Law, enterprise surveys)&#13;
and recommended actions for reform in specific areas of investment climate reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 11 -&#13;
ii. Discuss recommended actions in the memorandum of reform with the government.&#13;
(a  Identify key areas where impact of reforms could be substantial and where government&#13;
intervention is most likely to succeed in the short- to medium-term;&#13;
(b) Discuss proposed reforms in these areas and the feasibility of their implementation;&#13;
(c Identify any need for further technical assistance.&#13;
The results of the discussions are summarized in "Action Plans," which are shared with the&#13;
gc vernments shortly after the mission. Follow-up missions are organized as needed to provide more&#13;
in-depth support and monitor ongoing progress.&#13;
iii.  Provide technical assistance to governments.&#13;
Following identification of priorities, a WBG team will design a technical assistance program. Key&#13;
de iverables include:&#13;
a) Detailed process mappings and recommendations for improvement;&#13;
b) Legislative reviews to suggest amendments to business laws that will bring these laws into&#13;
line with international best practices;&#13;
c) Advice on institutional design and needed technology investments.&#13;
b)   Activitivies at the regional and sub-regional level:&#13;
At the regional and sub-regional levels, IBRA technical assistance will support a peer-to-peer&#13;
learning network to encourage reform momentum and collaboration across the LAC region. These&#13;
activities will include:&#13;
a) A series of regional and sub-regional learning events with attendance of countries seeking to&#13;
reform and those that are active reformers consistently pursuing improvements to the investment&#13;
climate.&#13;
The events will be conducted in two phaseS2. The first year of the peer-to-peer network will focus&#13;
on regulatory areas covered by Doing Business report indicators. At the end of the first 24 months&#13;
of the program, the program will emphasize training on topics that go beyond Doing Business&#13;
report indicators to include other key competitiveness issues in LAC that have been identified,&#13;
and may be included in the remaining period of the program.&#13;
bi Webinars every six months that will continue dialogue amongst the countries between the&#13;
events. This will allow the team to also follow up on progress and reform efforts.&#13;
c) "Peer assist" activities that can take several forms:&#13;
a. Staff from reforming governments to travel to other countries in the region to see how a&#13;
similar reform was completed.&#13;
b. Country experts travel to the reforming countries to advise directly on ongoing reforms.&#13;
2 The rati ,nale for the phased approach is to distribute limited capacity and resources in the participating governments over a sustainable&#13;
period of time, and to heed lessons of experience which suggest that simpler project design increases the chances to successful&#13;
implemen:ation.&#13;

ANNEX B&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES UNDER THE WB MULTI-DONOR&#13;
TRUST FUND (TFO71884)&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to, and form an integral part of, all agreements entered into between IFC,&#13;
the Bank and entities that provide contributions (collectively, the "Donors") (the aggregate of all&#13;
contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the Bank for the WB Multi-&#13;
Donor Trust Fund (TFO71884).&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF BANK ACTIVITIES&#13;
The ac:ivities described below will contribute to the following Expected Results:&#13;
Ultima te outcome: Increased competitiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean region&#13;
Intermcdiate outcomes:&#13;
*  Improved regulatory and administrative frameworks and processes for doing business in selected&#13;
participating countries&#13;
*  Increased efficiency and transparency in business entry procedures and licensing regimes in&#13;
selected participating countries&#13;
*  Enhanced efficiency and inclusiveness of tax regimes in participating countries&#13;
The Bank Activities will cover competition policy and indicator based reform activities&#13;
I.    Competition Policy Activities&#13;
Activities that will be carried out in each jurisdiction are grouped in three components: Feasibility of&#13;
removil of key competition constraints; Implementation of reform plans; and Dissemination of results&#13;
and ex: hange of international and regional best practices among countries.&#13;
1. Fcasibility of removal of key competition constraints: Assessing competition issues economy-&#13;
widc and in focus sectors and reviewing the competition policy framework&#13;
a) Roll-out of a Rapid Assessment Tool to identify competition issues economy-wide and in&#13;
focus sectors: Application of competition checklists that identify barriers to competition and&#13;
entry bottlenecks at the economy-wide level and in relevant sectors for doing business and coping&#13;
with household needs.&#13;
b) Identification of relevant competition constraints to improve the business environment:&#13;
Weakness of the economy-wide competition framework as well as sectoral policies that affect&#13;
market competition will be identified, giving special attention to provisions that are not aligned to&#13;
international practices. .&#13;
c) Design and Implementation of an Action Plan to remove competition constraints in the&#13;
country: The plan will consider key counterparts, strategic definition of steps to ensure broad&#13;
support, key milestones, participation of ad hoc consultants with international expertise on&#13;
relevant topics, and mission planning. Action plan will be discussed with relevant stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-14-&#13;
2. Implementation of reform plans: Providing technical assistance to government officials and key&#13;
stakeholders on key competition policy reforms&#13;
a) Provision of technical assistance to improve the competition policy framework: Technical&#13;
assistance includes recommendations on the amendment, elimination or issuance of regulations,&#13;
laws, secondary legislation, guidelines, etc. National legislation and practices will be compared to&#13;
international best practices and relevant international best practices will be tailored to the national&#13;
context. Carrying out of legal analyses will seek to support the creation, by the relevant&#13;
country(ies), of standard regulations that can be relevant for other countries in the region,&#13;
especially for neighboring countries that are part of the same regional community.&#13;
b) Follow-up to support the implementation of reform plans: The team will maintain a fluent&#13;
communication channel with the institutions responsible for implementing the respective reform&#13;
plan, in order to provide timely support thereto. Policy memos will be prepared.&#13;
3. Dissemination of results: Delivering workshops on competition policy and private sector&#13;
development, and peer-to-peer learning events on competition policy&#13;
a) Carrying out of workshops aimed at explaining the impact of attained reforms: Workshops&#13;
will focus on explaining the importance of competition policy to improve the business&#13;
environment, the regional effects of the reforms, and the positive effects on specific markets. The&#13;
final objective of this component is also to mainstream competition as a principle within&#13;
government policies.&#13;
b) Organization of a peer-to-peer learning event to disseminate lessons learnt: Countries in&#13;
similar context (and belonging to the same regional body) will be invited to the event, as well as&#13;
other countries with more advanced competition policy frameworks in order to ensure a&#13;
productive exchange of information for all participants.&#13;
II.   Indicator Based Reform Advisory (IBRA) Activities&#13;
The Indicator Based Reform Advisory component is composed of two main groups of activities:&#13;
Activities at the national level in each participating country; and Activities at the regional and sub-&#13;
regional levels aimed for the LAC region as a whole.&#13;
a)     Activities at the national level:&#13;
The IBRA technical assistance will be organized as follows:&#13;
i. Prepare a reform memorandum.&#13;
The reform memorandum for each country will outline country performance on the Doing Business&#13;
report and possibly other relevant indicators (e.g. Women, Business and the Law, enterprise surveys)&#13;
and recommended actions for reform in specific areas of investment climate reforms.&#13;
ii. Discuss recommended actions in the memorandum of reform with the government.&#13;
(a) Identify key areas where impact of reforms could be substantial and where government&#13;
intervention is most likely to succeed in the short- to medium-term;&#13;
(b) Discuss proposed reforms in these areas and the feasibility of their implementation;&#13;
(c) Identify any need for further technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 15 -&#13;
Th.- results of the discussions are summarized in "Action Plans," which are shared with the&#13;
gcriernments shortly after the mission. Follow-up missions are organized as needed to provide more&#13;
in.-depth support and monitor ongoing progress.&#13;
iii.        Provide technical assistance to governments.&#13;
Following identification of priorities, a WBG team will design a technical assistance program. Key&#13;
deliverables include:&#13;
a) Detailed process mappings and recommendations for improvement.&#13;
b) Suggest amendments to business laws that will bring these laws into line with international&#13;
best practices.&#13;
c) Advice on institutional design and needed technology investments.&#13;
b)      Activitivies at the regional and sub-regional levels:&#13;
At the regional and sub-regional levels, IBRA technical assistance will support a peer-to-peer&#13;
learning network to encourage reform momentum and collaboration across the LAC region. These&#13;
act.vities will include:&#13;
a) A series of regional and sub-regional learning events with attendance of countries seeking to&#13;
reform and those that are active reformers consistently pursuing improvements to the&#13;
investment climate.&#13;
The events will be conducted in two phases3. The first year of the peer-to-peer network will focus&#13;
on regulatory areas covered by Doing Business report indicators. At the end of the first 24 months&#13;
of the program, the program will emphasize training on topics that go beyond Doing Business&#13;
report indicators to include other key competitiveness issues in LAC that have been identified,&#13;
and may be included in the remaining period of the program.&#13;
b) Webinars every six months that will continue dialogue amongst the countries between the&#13;
events. This will allow the team to also follow up on progress and reform efforts.&#13;
c)    "Peer assist" activities that can take several forms:&#13;
a.   Staff of reforming governments to travel to other countries in the region to see how a&#13;
similar reform was completed.&#13;
b.   Country experts travel to the reforming countries to advise directly on ongoing reforms.&#13;
This pecr-to-peer technical assistance will complement the WBG's direct technical assistance to provide&#13;
regionat examples of success and work towards harmonizing regulation at the regional and sub-regional&#13;
levels.&#13;
B. CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;
The Contributions may be used to finance (a) associated overheads; (b) consultant fees (individuals and&#13;
firms); (c) contractual services; (d) field assignment benefits; (e) media, workshop, conference and&#13;
meetingr, costs; (f) staff costs (with and without indirect cost); (g) temporary support staff costs; and (h)&#13;
travel expenses.&#13;
3 The rati: nale for the phased approach is to distribute limited capacity and resources in the participating governments over a sustainable&#13;
period of time, and to heed lessons of experience which suggest that simpler project design increases the chances to successful&#13;
implemer :ation.&#13;
