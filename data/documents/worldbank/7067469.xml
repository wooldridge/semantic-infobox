The March 2005 Paris Declaration recognized that aid vol-         emphasizing substantive agricultural reform, participation by&#13;
umes and aid effectiveness must be raised to achieve the          all countries, and increased aid for trade. On agriculture,&#13;

clear agenda for the harmonization and alignment of donor&#13;
assistance and for managing for results that is being imple-&#13;
mented in 5 countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania,&#13;
Uganda, and Vietnam). Good progress is being made in 10 ad-&#13;
ditional countries, and elements of the agenda are being im-&#13;
plemented, though less systematically, in 40 more.&#13;
   During fiscal 2006, the Bank participated in international&#13;
efforts to establish a plan for monitoring implementation of&#13;
the Paris Declaration's 56 detailed commitments. An effort&#13;
to establish a baseline for the agreed-on indicators was&#13;
launched in May 2006, the first-ever opportunity for a simulta-&#13;
neous study and coordination of aid in a large number of&#13;
countries. Impediments to broader progress remain, however,&#13;
even in countries where governments and donors are working&#13;
on the agenda. These impediments include inadequate data,&#13;
inappropriate staff incentives (in donor agencies and govern-&#13;
ments), institutional rigidities, poor communication, and in-&#13;
sufficient institutional leadership in some donor agencies.&#13;

Increasing Support for Infrastructure In fiscal 2006 there&#13;
were 125 new projects approved with an infrastructure com-&#13;
ponent; these totaled more than $8 billion. This increase of&#13;
approximately 10 percent over the previous fiscal year is in&#13;
line with the Bank's Infrastructure Action Plan, developed in&#13;
2003 to respond more robustly to client requests involving&#13;
both infrastructure investment needs and broader develop-&#13;
ment objectives as outlined in the MDGs. Most of the com-&#13;
mitments were in the transportation sector (40 percent) and&#13;
the energy and mining sector (38 percent), followed by the&#13;
water, sanitation, and flood protection sector (21 percent).&#13;
Project quality has remained consistently high since the&#13;
plan's inception, and the proportion of projects at risk con-&#13;
tinues to be lower than the Bank average.&#13;
   In addition, the Bank delivered 139 analytic and advisory&#13;
products related to infrastructure, one of which was a major&#13;
study of lessons learned, Infrastructure at the Crossroads:&#13;
Lessons from 20 Years of World Bank Experience. At the G-8's&#13;
Gleneagles Summit, the Bank was asked to assume global&#13;
leadership in two infrastructure-related areas: ensuring suc-&#13;
cessful coordination of the sizable increase in aid provided in&#13;
support of the infrastructure agenda in Africa; and creating a&#13;
new framework for mobilizing investment in clean energy and&#13;
development. (See "Responding to Climate Change" on page&#13;

FOSTERING PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
The Bank's approach to participation empowers community&#13;
groups in South Asia to make development decisions, direct&#13;
resources, and have a role in projects. The emphasis is on&#13;
equity and the inclusion of poorer regions, communities, and&#13;
households in development projects. For instance, in India&#13;
and Pakistan, the Bank supports livelihood programs that&#13;
provide microfinance and self-employment opportunities to&#13;
millions of poor women. In Afghanistan, the Bank approved a&#13;
$40 million additional financing grant for the National&#13;

 BOX 2.3          REVIVING THE NORTHERN ARAL SEA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     By early 2005, the surface of the Northern Aral Sea had           An $85.8 million project for the improvement of waterworks&#13;
     shrunk to half its original size as a result of overirrigation    along the Syr Darya River and for construction of the 13-&#13;
     and ecological mismanagement. A dike completed in                 kilometer-long Kok-Aral dike between the Northern and&#13;
     August helped to partly refill the sea, lifting the hopes of      Southern Aral Seas was implemented jointly by the govern-&#13;
     the region's people. The Aral Sea is shared by Kazakhstan         ment of Kazakhstan and the Bank, with the Bank providing a&#13;
     and Uzbekistan, but its basin also encompasses                    loan of $65 million. The Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral&#13;
     Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and                 Sea Project built and restored waterworks along the river to&#13;
     Turkmenistan. Shrinkage began in the 1960s, when                  revive opportunities for fishing, farming, and hydroelectric&#13;
     massive diversions of water for cotton cultivation drained        power generation. Already, fish stocks are growing and&#13;

     the volume of the Aral Sea had declined by 75 percent,            Sea and surrounding lakes. In addition to spurring an&#13;
     devastating the surrounding environment and ruining the           ecological revival, the project helps reduce tensions between&#13;
     traditional fishing economy of the bordering villages. By         upstream countries using water for hydropower generation&#13;
     the late 1990s, the Aral Sea had been split into three            during the winter and downstream countries drawing on&#13;
     parts, two in the south and one in the north.                     water for irrigation during the summer.&#13;

the ways poverty hampers achievement of high and sustained&#13;

poverty reduction and high growth reinforce each other.&#13;
&#13;
BUILDING THE CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT&#13;
The Bank is helping governments throughout the region&#13;
improve the investment climate. For example, a $300 million&#13;
loan to Mexico is helping small businesses participate in the&#13;
formal market and improve competitiveness. A $250 million&#13;
loan to Colombia is facilitating the creation and operation of&#13;
businesses and improving access to finance. Perhaps most&#13;
important, the Bank is helping governments address their&#13;
development priorities through a series of development loans.&#13;
These loans are intended to boost growth, reduce poverty,&#13;
improve social indicators, reinforce macroeconomic stability,&#13;
and increase the efficiency of the public sector. For example,&#13;
El Salvador and Guatemala have received loans of $100&#13;
million, each under this program.&#13;

IBRDResources&#13;
IBRD obtains most of its funds by selling bonds in interna-&#13;
tional capital markets. In fiscal 2006, it raised $10 billion at&#13;
medium- to long-term maturities, lower than the $13 billion&#13;
raised in fiscal 2005. Debt securities, with a wide range of&#13;
maturities and structures, were issued in 11 currencies.&#13;
   IBRD is able to borrow high volumes for long maturities on&#13;
very favorable terms. IBRD's financial strength is based on its&#13;
prudent financial policies and practices, which help it main-&#13;

   As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize&#13;
profit but to earn enough income to ensure its financial&#13;

Harmonizing and aligning donor assistance occurs at the&#13;
country level through, for example, participation in joint&#13;
analytic work, collaborative preparation of country and sector&#13;
strategies, and development of common arrangements to&#13;
finance projects and programs. The Bank made further&#13;
progress with other donors on this agenda by signing a&#13;
Financial Management Framework Agreement with the&#13;
United Nations in March 2006. This agreement represents a&#13;
significant milestone in the Bank's ongoing program of finan-&#13;
cial management harmonization, which had, until now,&#13;
focused on bilateral and multilateral development agencies.&#13;
This new agreement allows the Bank to rely on the UN's&#13;
financial management regulations within a framework that&#13;
continues to provide the Bank with reasonable assurance that&#13;
its funds will be used for the intended purposes.&#13;

            This World Bank Annual Report for FY2006
            notes that the past year saw both progress and continued
            challenges in the global fight against poverty and
            inequality. The Report discusses the following topical
            highlights:  Debt relief for the poorest countries;
            targeting development in Africa; addressing governance and
            anticorruption issues globally; improving partnerships with
            the international community; quick responses to potential
            avian flu outbreaks; and disaster relief. There were 112
            IBRD projects totaling $14.1 billion. The top three sectors
            for lending were Law and Justice and Public Administration;
            Transportation; and Energy and Mining. As for IDA
            concessional lending, 167 projects totaled $9.5 billion. The
            top three Sectors were Law and Justice and Public
            Administration; Transportation; and Health and Other Social
            Services. Non-lending Activities comprises 307 technical
            assistance activities; and 601 economic and sector work
            products. There were 16 major evaluations by the Independent
            Evaluation Group reviewing the Bank's performance on a
            range of activities including country assistance, debt
            relief, development effectiveness, middle-income countries,
            post-disaster assistance, and trade. More than 150
            publications were issued, including Global Development
            Finance 2006, Global Monitoring Report 2006, World
            Development Indicators 2006, and World Development Report
            2006: Equity and Development. While country-led poverty
            reduction and national development strategies continued to
            be important mechanisms for defining country priorities and
            aid strategies, several additional issues moved to the
            forefront of the Bank's activities during fiscal 2006.
            These diverse issues included improving governance and
            accountability, implementing a new Multilateral Debt Relief
            Initiative, expanding initiatives undertaken within the 2005
            Africa Action Plan, developing a framework for middle-income
            countries, supporting agriculture in the poorest countries,
            cooperating with other international organizations to combat
            avian flu, searching for new approaches to deal with climate
            change, and strengthening partnerships to put in place a
            monitoring plan for the March 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid
            Effectiveness. The Bank also responded to emergencies,
            including the October 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan
            and the May 2006 earthquake in Indonesia.
