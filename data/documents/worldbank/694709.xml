Borrower:               Government of Georgia&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Georgia Municipal Development Program Coordination Unit and&#13;
Municipal Development Fund&#13;
Beneficiaries:          Municipalities&#13;
IDA Credit Amount:      SDR 15.1 million (US$20.9 million equivalent)&#13;
Credit Terms:           35 years maturity, including a 10 year grace period, on standard IDA&#13;
terms&#13;
Commitment Fee:         0.5 percent on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;

Financing Plan          See Section III&#13;
Project Objectives:     The proposed project supports the initial stage of the decentralization&#13;
process aimed at shifting responsibility and accountability in terms of&#13;
delivery and maintenance of urban services to municipalities. The&#13;
project's primary objectives are:&#13;
(a) assisting the decentralization process at the central and&#13;
local government level;&#13;
(b) promoting an improvement of financial and&#13;
administrative management as well as municipal&#13;
investment program;&#13;
(c) supporting urgent local investments;&#13;
(d) generating employment opportunities&#13;
Project Description:    The proposed project would consist of the following two&#13;
components:&#13;
(a) Institutional Development of central and local&#13;
governments through: (i) implementation of a municipal&#13;
development program articulated around a Municipal&#13;
Development Agreement, a binding agreement between&#13;
the central and local government; (ii) support activities,&#13;
including T.A., training, and studies aimed at&#13;
strengthening the central government's capacity to&#13;
implement effectively the planned decentralization&#13;
program; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
(b) Phvsical Investments, through the Municipal&#13;
Development Fund, encompassing the financing of&#13;
construction rehabilitation and maintenance of public&#13;
infrastructure (primary and secondary), facilities, and&#13;
services under the responsibility of local government,&#13;
including roads, drainage, lighting, water supply,&#13;
sanitation, and social, administrative, as well as cultural&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Project Benefits:          The project will support the decentralization process and promote a&#13;
more active role for municipalities. Specifically, it will:&#13;
(a) stimulate the capacity of local government to efficiently&#13;
program, finance, manage and maintain facilities and&#13;
services;&#13;
(b) facilitate improved municipal financial performance and&#13;
contribute to national development objectives by&#13;
reducing the public sector deficit; and&#13;
(c) have a favorable impact - economically and socially - on&#13;
the urban population through: (i) reduced costs and better&#13;
access to municipal services; and (ii) employment&#13;
generation.&#13;
Project Risks:            The program major risks are:&#13;
(a) inability of the Government to enact the required legal&#13;
and fiscal reforms or effectively manage the&#13;
decentralization program;&#13;
(b) unfavorable macro-economic conditions during program&#13;
execution; and&#13;
(c) failure of municipalities to implement the municipal&#13;
development programs or to reimburse their share of the&#13;
credit.&#13;
These risks are acceptable due to:&#13;
(a) the strong ownership demonstrated by the Government in&#13;
the proposed program and municipalities' participation&#13;
on a voluntary and competitive basis;&#13;
(b) the close built-in monitoring of public investment&#13;
programs; and&#13;
(c) the allocation of resources based on performance.&#13;
Public Participation:      Project preparation involved a wide range of stakeholders through&#13;
participatory workshops which sought feedback on proposed project&#13;
activities. The project will also promote strong community&#13;
participation in the local decision-making process.&#13;
Environmental Aspects:    The project has been rated as environmental screening category B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
Poverty Target:         Improved urban infrastructure and services will most benefit to the poor.&#13;
Considering the type of investments, the impact on the labor market,&#13;
particularly on unskilled labor force, is expected to be very positive.&#13;
Rate of Return:         When applicable superior to 12%&#13;
Estimated Project&#13;
Completion date         The project completion date is October 31, 2001&#13;

GEORGIA&#13;
MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION PROGRAM&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I.  SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    THE COUNTRY AND ITS RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT&#13;
HISTORICAL SETTING&#13;
1.1    A Painful Transition. Georgia was the first of the non-Baltic states to declare&#13;
independence from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) on April 9, 1991. Before 1991, Georgia had&#13;
a relatively prosperous economy, specializing in exports of agricultural products (almost&#13;
exclusively to the other Soviet republics), in the extraction of metals, and in the assembly of a&#13;
wide range of industrial products. Income per capita was just below 3,000 rubles (or about&#13;
US$1,600), placing Georgia in midway among the 15 former Soviet republics.&#13;
1.2   In the years directly following its independence, Georgia suffered one of the sharpest&#13;
economic declines of all the FSU states. Officially estimated GDP in 1994 was less than 15&#13;
percent of its 1989 level. Electricity consumption - often considered as a better proxy for real&#13;
GDP in transition economies - is estimated to have fallen by 55 percent in the same period. The&#13;
decline in government revenues as a percentage of GDP (the tax ratio), a consequence of the&#13;
erosion in the government's authority and ability to mobilize revenues, was even more striking.&#13;
From 30% in 1991, the tax ratio fell to 11% in 1992, and collapsed to 3.7 % in 1995. Huge&#13;
financial imbalances led to hyperinflation (at rates of up to 70% per month until the second half&#13;
of 1994) and a sharp depreciation in the value of domestic currency. In December 1993, the&#13;
Georgian coupon was worth less than I% of its value in January of the same year.&#13;
1.3    A Remarkable Turnaround. Acting against this background, the government focused&#13;
on economic management in early 1994 and arrested the contraction in trade and economic&#13;
activity. Although extensive data on the current level of economic activity is unavailable, there&#13;
are indications that Georgia's economic situation has improved significantly in recent months.&#13;
With the successful introduction of the country's new currency (the Lari, introduced on&#13;
September 25, 1995), major steps toward macroeconomics stabilization were taken and a sharp&#13;
reduction of the fiscal deficit, from 26.2% of GDP in 1993 to 4.5% in 1995, was achieved.&#13;
While the economic situation remains precarious, stabilization measures have already brought&#13;
considerable results: the monthly inflation rate fell from an average of 60 percent in the first&#13;
three quarters of 1994 to an average of 2% between October 1994 and April 1995; the inflation&#13;
rate for 1996 was 13.9%. Gross official reserves have been rebuilt and most of the bilateral debt&#13;
has been rescheduled. Moreover, substantial structural reforms (subsidies reduction, price&#13;
liberalization, civil service restructuring, fiscal administration improvement, etc.) have begun.&#13;
After four years of continuous decline, growth resumed with total GDP growing by 2.4% in 1995&#13;
and 10.5% in 1996 - a turnaround unique among transition economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4    Ethnic and Political Divisions. With a multi-           Box 1: Country Ethnic Profile&#13;
ethnic population of 5.4 million, the country has recently&#13;
experienced considerable political and civil strife mainly   Stretching across the Greater&#13;
,   .   ,   , .              ~~~~~~~Caucasus from the border with&#13;
due to secessionist tendencies of several ethnic groups.     Caecasua to the blcSea Gia&#13;

These tendencies have been particularly intense where        is located at the crossroads of&#13;
ethnic minorities are geo-graphically concentrated such as   Western and Eastern civilization. Its&#13;
in Ossetia and Abkhazia where these groups enjoyed a high    position as such is reflected in the&#13;
degree of autonomy in Soviet times (a similar case is that   country's history, art, cultural&#13;
of the south-western region of Adjaria which, while          sensitivity, and its ethnic diversity.&#13;
peaceful, has established several governmental institutions     In the aggregate, non ethnic&#13;
of its own). Civil conflicts, first in South Ossetia then in  Georgians comprise 29.9% of the&#13;
country's total population of 5.4&#13;
Abkhazia, resulted in more than 300,000 Internally           million. The largest ethnic groups&#13;
Displaced People (IDP), with Tbilisi alone receiving about    include: Armenians (8.1%); Russians&#13;
100,000 refugees. Since 1992, peacekeeping forces have       (6.3%); Azeris (5.7%); Ossetians&#13;
maintained stability in South Ossetia and, after more than   (3%); Greeks (1.9%); Abkhaz&#13;
two years of separatist war in Abkhazia, a cease-fire has    (I.8%); and Ukrainians (1%).&#13;
been in effect since 1994, although Georgia has not yet&#13;
regained control of the region. Civil conflicts in other countries in the Caucasus region&#13;
(Chechnya, Nagorno-Karabakh) have also indirectly added to the disruption of Georgia's&#13;
economy. However, a recent pact with South Ossetia and an apparent settlement, albeit tenuous,&#13;
in Abkhazia have contributed to greater political stability, allowing the Government to adopt a&#13;
new Constitution and implement a democratization process, make progress toward restoring law&#13;
and order, and focus attention on rebuilding the economy.&#13;
1.5    Social Crisis. The downturn in the state-controlled economy and runaway inflation until&#13;
mid-1994 have inflicted painful social costs on the population. Shrinking resources have&#13;
complicated the Government's efforts to maintain law and order and to preserve an adequate&#13;
social safety net for the poor. By 1995, GDP per capita had shrunk to US$4 10, the second&#13;
lowest level among the FSU countries, placing the majority of the Georgian population under the&#13;
official poverty line. Expenditures on health and education declined from 12 percent of GDP in&#13;
1991 to 2 percent in 1994 (although expenditures in the health sector appear to be rising again) -&#13;
a decline of over 90 percent in real terms. Life expectancy. for both men and women, has&#13;
declined in recent years, while the age-adjusted mortality rate has risen by 18 percent. Net&#13;
school enrollment has likewise fallen by 11 percent in the last three years.&#13;
1.6    There are, however, positive indications that Georgia's strong traditional family&#13;
structure has cushioned the impact of declining social services. While economic figures suggest&#13;
extreme hardship, casual observation suggests an upturn in the overall activity. The informal&#13;
sector is growing and in contrast to reports from other FSU countries, rural incomes have held up&#13;
fairly well. The area of cultivated land in 1995 significantly exceeded that of previous years and&#13;
in key cities, the traffic, the number of shops open for business, and the availability of goods in&#13;
markets indicate rapidly improving trends.&#13;
1.7    Municipal Infrastructure. With an economy under severe stress and an erosion in&#13;
public confidence, physical infrastructure and municipal services have been neglected and are&#13;
deteriorating rapidly. While trying to cope with the current situation, the municipal sector still&#13;
operates largely under the organizational and policy structure of earlier days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.8   In approximate terms, more than half (55%) of Georgia's population lives in urban&#13;
settlements. Tbilisi, the capital and largest city in the country, has a population of 1.5 million&#13;
and makes up 27 percent of the total population of Georgia and 51 percent of its urban&#13;
population. The remaining six largest urban settlements include: Kutaisi (240,000), Rustavi&#13;
(156,000), Batumi (137,000), Zugdidi (129,000), Poti (75,000) and Gori (60,000). Together with&#13;
Tbilisi, their population makes up approximately 75% of the urban population of Georgia.&#13;
While the armed conflicts of recent years have caused major changes in the geographical&#13;
distribution of the population, no reliable information on migration trends is yet available.&#13;
However, there have been two conflicting trends. It is thought that declining income levels led&#13;
to an exodus of city dwellers to rural areas. This trend was probably outweighed, however, by&#13;
the influx of the 300,000 refugees to the principal cities.&#13;
B.  INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.9    Present Conditions. Today, the main concern with respect to local government in&#13;
Georgia involves its inherent institutional weakness. The social turmoil, political instability and&#13;
economic crisis of the past six years have caused the central government to postpone sub-&#13;
national administrative reform and proceed - at least temporarily - with rule by decree. At&#13;
present, nearly all local government officials are appointed by the center; as a result, local&#13;
government autonomy does not exist in principle. Substantial freedom of action for these&#13;
centrally appointed local officials has existed in practice, however, because of the weakness of&#13;
the central government and its inability to maintain tight control over the various localities&#13;
1.10   The symptoms of weakness common to local government institutions in most of the FSU&#13;
are particularly acute in Georgia, because of the mutually reinforcing effects of recent economic&#13;
recession, war and general breakdown of civil order. Among the most significant of these&#13;
problems are: (a) little accountability to residents because there are no mechanisms allowing&#13;
citizens to monitor the actions of local govemment, nor is there any formal procedure to voice&#13;
civic discontent or call for the removal of poorly performing officials. Ultimately, those who&#13;
pay for municipal services, either through taxation or direct fees, have no representation in&#13;
municipal rule; (b) local officials are not bound by systematic internal regulations, but rather&#13;
only by guidelines set out by the centrally appointed official; and (c) inefficiencies in the&#13;
management of the municipality's administrative functions with overstaffing and unclear&#13;
allocation of responsibility among local officials. As a result, decision-making and&#13;
implementation are largely left to the individual initiative of municipal staff.&#13;
1.11   Departing Structure. Until recently, the structure and function of local government in&#13;
Georgia was based on provisions specified in a number of Presidential (formerly known as the&#13;
Head of State) decrees which were intended to carry the country through a transitional phase&#13;
eventually leading to local elections (tentatively scheduled for Autumn 1997 or early 1998).&#13;
From 1992 until the end of 1995, institutional adjustments in the local government sector were&#13;
aimed almost exclusively at the improvement of resource allocation and did not affect the basic&#13;
structure inherited from the Soviet period.&#13;
1.12   Among the various decrees produced by the Head of State's Office since 1993, the&#13;
Provisional Statement "About Local Management Bodies in Georgia" (Decree No. 362,&#13;
September 16, 1995) had the single biggest implication for local government in Georgia. This&#13;
decree consolidates previously uncoordinated temporary legislation into a comprehensive format&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
defining the structure, activity and competence of local management bodies. The decision was&#13;
introduced "in order to further improve the state management system, to create the basis for self-&#13;
control provided by the Georgian Constitution, to strengthen the economic basis of state&#13;
management local agencies and to carry out progressive radical economic reforms" (Article 1).&#13;
It will remain in force until the election of the local self-government bodies, whose officials will&#13;
replace today's centrally appointed figures.&#13;
1.13   Complementary regulations were   Box 2: Three Levels of local government.&#13;
adopted for specific cities or regions;&#13;
particularly, in those which have been    Lower level: includes management of settlements,&#13;

1.14   Ongoing Reform. On the wave of gradual economic recovery, since the end of 1995 the&#13;
Government and the Parliament have operated toward fulfilling their specific constitutional&#13;
obligation to implement local self- government reform. Article 4.2 of the Constitution, in fact,&#13;
reads as follows: "Georgian citizens shall arrange local affairs through self-government, without&#13;
the violation of national sovereignty. The rule of establishment of local self-government bodies,&#13;
their powers and relationship with state bodies will be determined by organic law". Through the&#13;
concerted efforts of the Government's Regional Policy and Management Service (RPMS) and&#13;
the Parliament, Georgia has made considerable progress toward the establishment of the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework. Presently, the proposed new Law on Local Self-Government and&#13;
Administration (recently approved by Parliament and now ready to be countersigned by the&#13;
President) and the State Program for Municipal Development (SPMD), to be discussed and&#13;
approved by the Cabinet before the end of July, 1997, prepare the ground for a more modem,&#13;
democratic and efficient system of sub-national territorial administration. In addition to the&#13;
importance of each document within the framework of the country's administrative and financial&#13;
decentralization, the consistency and potential synergy between the both approaches denotes a&#13;
high level of cooperation between Government and the Parliament, thus warranting cautious&#13;
optimism with regard to the pace and effectiveness of future reform. The Government's reform&#13;
plan was summarized in the recent Municipal Sector Policy Letter (Annex 1). The Government&#13;
program confirms that local elections are to take place by June 1998 at the latest.&#13;
1.15   To implement the municipal development program, the President has signed a Decree&#13;
No 105 "Regarding the Approval of the Regional Policy and Management Service of the&#13;
President of Georgia". (February 14, 1997). This new regulation establishes the RPMS as the&#13;
central coordination unit at the government level in charge of ensuring political oversight of the&#13;
decentralization process. The Head of the unit, located at the State Chancellery, reports directly&#13;
to the President and the State Minister, and is supported by the following departments:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
- Relations With Eastern Regions Of Georgia&#13;
- Relations With Western Regions Of Georgia&#13;
- Control/ Inspection&#13;
- Regional Socio-Economic Policy&#13;
- Human Resources Management.&#13;
1.16   Among its key objectives and ttsks, the unit will work out state policy in the sphere of&#13;
local government, create the political and legal basis for transition to self-government&#13;
institutions, and help define key directions of municipal and regional development, all while&#13;
operating in full consultation and cooperation with the Parliament.&#13;
C. MUNICIPAL FINANCE&#13;
1.17   Georgia's 1995 tax ratio (est. at 3.7) was among the lowest in the world. The&#13;
implications of this low tax ratio are substantial for municipalities, because just under half (47%)&#13;
of all central government revenues in 1995 were passed on to municipalities. Despite this,&#13;
however, revenues - in relative terms - of the principal Georgian cities have improved&#13;
considerably over the last two to three years. The growth in revenues for the City of Tbilisi from&#13;
1993 to 1995 illustrates municipal revenue growth accounting for more than a quarter (27%) of&#13;
the total and more than half (51 %) of the urban population respectively. The recent changes in&#13;
the composition of revenues as well as their volume have been dramatic. Total revenues,&#13;
including loans and subsidy receipts, increased more than 7 times from 1993 to 1995. Declining&#13;
reliance on borrowing and central government subsidies over the period meant that tax revenue&#13;
and other receipts increased almost twelve fold, however. In fact, the increase in Tbilisi's&#13;
revenues was particularly marked from 1994 to 1995. While total revenues increased more than&#13;
sevenfold over the whole period, they merely doubled between 1993 and 1994. The&#13;
interpretation of these spectacular rates of growth should be moderated by the realization that&#13;
they do not reflect an economic boom so much as recovery from a prior period of almost total&#13;
economic breakdown.&#13;
Major Sources of Municipal Revenues&#13;
1.18   Taxes. Georgia's current tax system was authorized in the Law on the Basics of the Tax&#13;
System in Georgia (December 21, 1993), in which the importance of local government autonomy&#13;
was clearly established, with the assertion of the right to levy local taxes. Principal taxes are&#13;
allocated to one level of government or the other, or are sometimes shared, with the base and&#13;
rates being determined by the central government. Among national taxes, the Value Added Tax&#13;
(VAT), customs duties and land taxes are shared between central and local governments in&#13;
differing proportions. Proceeds from the enterprise profits tax are allocated entirely to local&#13;
governments, while excise duties are retained by the central government. In 1995, 47.3% of&#13;
total "national" tax revenues was transferred to local budgets.&#13;
1.19   Intergovernmental Tax-Sharing Arrangements. The sharing arrangements for these&#13;
"national" taxes are based on the derivation principle: revenues are returned to the areas in which&#13;
they were collected. The geographic allocation of these revenues has shifted several times with&#13;
changing economic conditions. Initially, for instance, the VAT sharing arrangements gave cities&#13;
with a substantial industrial base (e.g., Rustavi) a 10% share of VAT revenues as opposed to the&#13;
30% share received by other localities. This was an attempt at equalization by offsetting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
higher yield of the VAT in the cities with a richer tax base. As more cities ran into budgetary&#13;
difficulties, the number of those receiving 30% of VAT revenues was increased. In 1995, the&#13;
central government planned to redistribute 2.2 million Lari from local budgets of better-off&#13;
communities, but only 0.3 million Lari were actually made available for transfer.&#13;
1.20   Local Taxes. In the Tax Law of December 21, 1993, mayors were given the right to&#13;
raise "local" levies and fees such as trading licenses, parking fees and specific sales taxes such as&#13;
taxes on vehicle sales. The list of potential local taxes authorized (i.e, presumptive taxes, local&#13;
sales and excise taxes, local tariffs, land and asset taxes, etc.) is quite extensive and does not&#13;
appear to be confined to the usual variety of minor fees or taxes which have been allocated to&#13;
local governments in many CIS and Eastern European countries. Although each tax must be&#13;
approved by the President's office, many of the taxes currently levied by individual&#13;
municipalities have substantial revenue potential. Furthermore, a most important general&#13;
provision of this law allows mayors to impose "special purpose levies.... for the improvement of&#13;
municipal territories, police, and other purposes". Extensive and, for the most part, constructive&#13;
use has been made of this provision by the principal cities.&#13;
Municipal Expenditures&#13;
1.21   Although the available expenditure classifications are vague and do not provide clear&#13;
linkages to specific service categories, the 1995 level of local expenditures in Georgian&#13;
municipalities appear to vary dramatically from a high of US$28 per capita per year in Poti, to a&#13;
low of US$8 in Batumi. Tbilisi is at a mid-range with US$15. Based on data received from the&#13;
principal cities for 1995, the major expenditures are: maintenance of communal services&#13;
(lighting, drainage, roads, cleaning, etc.), education, health, and subsidies for urban transport and&#13;
housing. Currently, the level of expenditures in the social sectors is significant and probably&#13;
equivalent to the funding provided from the central budget for similar services.&#13;
1.22   Cost recovery for urban services was not one of the goals of the former command&#13;
economy in Georgia. Utility charges to consumers were extremely low - about 2-3% of costs in&#13;
Tbilisi, for instance. Prices did not serve the same regulating function as in market economies&#13;
and domestic consumers of local public utility services were subsidized both directly and&#13;
indirectly; directly by municipal subsidies and indirectly by cross-subsidies paid for by price&#13;
discrimination against industrial and commercial users. Prospects for cost recovery in&#13;
infrastructure services, together with all municipal revenues, seem to have increased with the&#13;
turnaround of the Georgian economy in 1995,&#13;
Municipal Investment Financing&#13;
1.23   Current investments at the municipal level are negligible and borrowing capacity is&#13;
limited. Local governments do have collateral for loans, not only in the form of property that&#13;
they own, but implicitly through future streams of utility charges or transfers from the central&#13;
government. However, the weak state of the financial system in Georgia restricts borrowing by&#13;
even the most creditworthy local governments. There is no mechanism to lend to local&#13;
governments for investments in infrastructure and the central government does not fulfill the role&#13;
of intermediary between domestic/international funding sources and local governments. This&#13;
complete lack of municipal investment financing sources contributes to justifying the present&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
D.    BANK EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.24 Bank strategy and projects. The principal lessons learned from over a decade of Bank&#13;
experience in lending for municipal development, worldwide, include the importance of: (a)&#13;
strong and consistent central government support for the principles of financially sound&#13;
municipal development; (b) intensive project supervision; (c) project design that is simple and&#13;
that, at the sub-project level, reflects the needs and desires of municipalities participating in the&#13;
project; (d) reasonable eligibility criteria for participation; (e) need for central government&#13;
assistance in the identification and preparation of municipal sub-projects; and (f) simple and&#13;
efficient procedures for sub-project review and approval. Those lessons have been taken into&#13;
account in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
1.25   Bank experience in Georgia. IDA's credit experience dates only from FY94. However,&#13;
strong future potential of the local government sector in Georgia has been confirmed at every&#13;
stage of the Bank's assistance effort so far. The Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(the IDA Board of Directors approved the US$18 million credit on November 9, 1994) which&#13;
was identified and prepared rapidly in response to the country's immediate needs in the&#13;
aftermath of the civil war, is nearing the end of a successful implementation. The project has&#13;
provided the indispensable country-knowledge for the preparation of the following ongoing&#13;
activities: (i) a Social Investment Fund Project, due for appraisal in May-June, 1997; (ii) a&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which was recently identified and is mainly intended to&#13;
target sector-specific needs in Tbilisi and at the Gardabani Waste Water Treatment Plant; (iii) an&#13;
IDF-financed Cultural Heritage Initiative, whose implementation is beginning under strong&#13;
Government support, following a highly participatory identification process for six pilot sites;&#13;
and (iv) the Legal Framework and Municipal Database IDF Grant approved recently.&#13;
1.26   In addition to the municipal sector activities, the following operations were approved by&#13;
the Board: an Institutional Building Credit of US$ 10.1 million equivalent was approved on July&#13;
5, 1994; a Rehabilitation Credit of US$75 million equivalent was approved on March 30, 1995; a&#13;
Transportation Credit of US$12 million equivalent was approved on January 6, 1996; a&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit of US$60 million equivalent and an associated TA. Credit of&#13;
US$4.8 million equivalent were approved on April 18, 1996; and a Health Credit of US$14&#13;
million equivalent was approved on April 25, 1996, and an Agriculture Project (US$15 million).&#13;
Although the portfolio is increasing rapidly, limited implementation experience was gained in&#13;
these various sectors.&#13;
1.27   The overall implementation performance of the first operations is considered highly&#13;
satisfactory by both the Government and the Bank. However, experiences from these activities&#13;
have shown that four key factors can help facilitate project implementation: (i) simplicity of&#13;
project design; (ii) active Government participation in project preparation; (iii) support in project&#13;
management for agencies inexperienced in implementing Bank projects; and, (iv) intensive&#13;
supervision efforts by the Bank. These lessons have been taken into consideration in the design&#13;
of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
E.    RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy Objectives Supported by the Program&#13;
1.28   The proposed IDA assistance program is consistent with the limited Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS), as discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the&#13;
Rehabilitation Credit on March 30, 1995. A full CAS is currently under preparation and Board&#13;
review is scheduled in September, 1997. The proposed project is consistent with the priority&#13;
objectives of the CAS by: (a) improving the mobilization of local resources; (b) developing&#13;
institutional capacity for better expenditure management at the central and local levels; (c)&#13;
improving the management of public assets, critical for private sector development - particularly&#13;
through improved maintenance; and (d) reducing poverty.&#13;
Relevance of the Municipal Sector&#13;
1.29   The quality of municipal infrastructure and service provision helps determine a country's&#13;
success or failure in diversifying production, expanding trade, reducing poverty and improving&#13;
environmental conditions. Georgia's future economic recovery and its overall development into&#13;
a market-oriented economy will largely depend on its ability to establish dynamic local&#13;
administrations. As the country gradually emerges from years of political, social and economic&#13;
turmoil, the many legitimate demands of enterprises and households - long left on hold - should&#13;
be expected to gradually influence the government's agenda. As a consequence, Georgia is&#13;
already facing a well-known fiscal dilemma: How to generate sufficient public investment&#13;
without incurring excessive public debt? Centralized control of aggregate public debt alone is&#13;
not conducive to an optimal level of public investment. On the other hand, the partial transfer of&#13;
responsibility for infrastructure investments/maintenance and provision of communal services to&#13;
local governments can help optimize resource allocation while under fiscal constraints.&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
1.30   Local governments, whose overall revenues more than doubled between 1994 and 1995,&#13;
contributed significantly to the above improvements and will be expected to contribute more in&#13;
the future, as greater authority for managing many public services is planned to be devolved to&#13;
them. From the consolidation of civil and democratic life in towns and villages to the provision&#13;
of basic communal services (i.e., water supply, public transport, etc.), municipalities are bound&#13;
to assume a leading role. In response to the growing importance of local governments in the&#13;
economic and political life of the country, the Government has undertaken a broad sector reform&#13;
effort aimed at attaining greater decentralization as defined by the principle of subsidiary (i.e.,&#13;
any administrative or economic responsibility should be delegated to the lowest level of&#13;
government capable of discharging it effectively).&#13;
1.31   Through its Municipal Development Program, the Government has decided to&#13;
implement a comprehensive decentralization strategy consistent with Georgia's long-term&#13;
economic and administrative needs. As stated in its Municipal Sector Policy Letter signed in&#13;
May 1997, this would "...be achieved through: (i) legal and regulatory framework which would&#13;
clearly define the state and municipal property; (ii) promoting the fiscal and economic&#13;
independence of local government... ,(iii) improved service delivery for local population ... ;(iv)&#13;
improved utilization of local resources for the development of local social infrastructure; (v)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
establishment of the Municipal Development Fund ..; and (vi) development of information&#13;
systems..." (Annex 1). The culmination of this reform effort will be reached with Georgia's first&#13;
local elections, scheduled before June 1998. The local government elections will constitute&#13;
another major milestone in the country's overall democratization process.&#13;
Specific Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices&#13;
1.32   The proposed MDDP responds to an overall strategic framework defined by: (a) the&#13;
Government's decentralization policy; (b) the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy; and (c)&#13;
recent sector work. Consistent with its development objectives, the program will target the&#13;
following issues/themes:&#13;
(a) Strengthening/management capacity-building of the local government sector.&#13;
Like most other countries of the FSU, Georgia faces considerable problems related&#13;
to the institutional weakness of public administration, both central and local. While&#13;
slight improvements in the quality of municipal management have become visible in&#13;
recent months (for example in Kutaisi, the country's second largest municipality),&#13;
the present ability of local governments to effectively address the needs of the&#13;
population in terms of basic services and administrative functions gives rise to&#13;
concern.&#13;
(b)  Promoting greater transparency and accountability in local governance.&#13;
Constituencies should come to consider municipal policy as an inextricable&#13;
component of the local community's needs and ambitions. By establishing strict&#13;
standards of public information and consultation as a prerequisite for access to the&#13;
MDF, the MDDP could significantly contribute to attaining greater transparency and&#13;
accountability in municipal governance.&#13;
(c) Creating a conducive environment for local revenue mobilization. The project&#13;
could lay the groundwork for the country's envisaged general fiscal reform. By&#13;
helping to bridge the gap between municipal revenues and expenditures through&#13;
strict eligibility criteria for credit under the municipal contract, the MDDP could&#13;
prepare the ground for Georgia's successful fiscal reform, which the Government&#13;
and the Parliament recognize as a prerequisite for longer term economic&#13;
stabilization.&#13;
(d)  Improvement of the level and quality of municipal service provision through better&#13;
maintenance and infrastructure. The important objective of improved service&#13;
delivery could be achieved through: (i) focused and explicit performance evaluation&#13;
criteria; (ii) introduction of competitive principles among service providers, be they&#13;
municipally owned or private; and, (iii) phasing out of subsidies and gradual but&#13;
decisive enforcement of cost-recovery in all municipal services.&#13;
1.33   The proposed MDDP attempts to best integrate the particular emphasis that the&#13;
Government is placing on the effective restructuring of the municipal system. While it is the&#13;
first step of an iterative process, this assistance program focuses on the priorities identified as&#13;
essential to improve the efficiency of local governments. The program will evolve over the&#13;
medium and long term, incorporating the progress made and learning from the difficulties&#13;
encountered, all within the broader context of the Country Assistance Strategy.&#13;
&#13;

II.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. PROJECT GENESIS&#13;
2.1    The Bank undertook a review of the Georgian Municipal Sector and prepared an&#13;
informal note in 1996. The discussion of the findings with the government authorities and&#13;
municipal officials provided an excellent forum to share views about the role of local&#13;
governments and the importance of an adequate municipal strategy during the transition period&#13;
to a market-based economy. Following these discussions, the Minister of Finance and more&#13;
recently the Economic Advisor to the President requested IDA assistance to prepare-a project to&#13;
support the ongoing decentralization process and foster the development of strong local&#13;
governments. Project preparation was carried out jointly with the Aid Coordination Unit and the&#13;
RPMS. Other government agencies, such as the State Ministry, the State Chancellery, several&#13;
Regional Governors, and Municipalities were consulted and played a key role in the final design&#13;
of the program.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.2    This project would support the initial&#13;
stage of Georgia's decentralization process,       Box 3: Coniraclual Methodology.&#13;
which aims at gradually shifting responsibility       IDA resources allocation will be demand-&#13;
and accountability to municipalities for the      driven (i.e., based on the principle of volunteerism).&#13;
Selected municipalities participate only if they wish&#13;
delivery and maintenance of urban services, by    to do so, and if they are willing to undertake a&#13;
helping to improve their organizational,          municipal adjustment process.&#13;
management and financial base. The program's          This approach, the bottom-up, self selecting,&#13;
objectives are: (i) assisting the decentralization  process (versus top-down, planning and selection&#13;
process at the central and local government       decisions made by the central government) is&#13;
level; (ii) promoting an improvement of           expected to introduce an element of competition&#13;
among local govemments for funds and will allow&#13;
financial and administrative management as well   MDF to include in the project only those local&#13;
as municipal investment program; (iii)            governments which are committed and capable of&#13;
supporting urgent local investments; (iv); and    making necessary policy changes.&#13;
generating employment opportunities.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.3    Consistent with the Georgia State Regional and Municipal Development Program, the&#13;
proposed investment assistance program will not only focus on physical targets, but integrate&#13;
policy issues related to municipal management. The MDDP addresses the major bottlenecks&#13;
directly and be a catalyst for adjustment in the sector. It was agreed during Negotiations that the&#13;
SPMD, once finalized, would be transmitted to the Bank [see para. 6. la].&#13;
2.4    The project would include two main components, as follows:&#13;
Component I: Institutional Development (US$ 5.7 million of which IDA credit US$4.6 million)&#13;
The project will finance the institutional development of central, regional, and local governments&#13;
through municipal and national institution-building activities. Annex 2 provides a detailed&#13;
description of this component. Within the Institutional Development component, two sub-&#13;
components will respectively focus on the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
(a) Institutional development, at the municipal level. This sub-component will primarily&#13;
support the implementation of a municipal development program articulated around a&#13;
Municipal Development Agreement (MDA), a binding agreement between the central&#13;
government and municipalities. It includes: (i) general municipal management&#13;
improvement encompassing the preparation of MDAs for participating municipalities in&#13;
the project; (ii) organization and management improvement, including improvement of&#13;
services to the public, development of simplified administrative procedures; (iii)&#13;
strengthening municipal planning and programming procedures; (iv) human resource&#13;
planning, including the development of a career and incentives structure within&#13;
municipalities, the definition of training needs; and (v) physical investment project&#13;
implementation management.&#13;
(b) Institutional development, at the national level, would focus on strengthening the central&#13;
government's capacity to implement effectively the planned decentralization program.&#13;
Various activities aimed at providing an enabling environment for municipal&#13;
development programs: (i) national information systems of municipalities necessary to&#13;
manage the restructuring of municipal service delivery; (ii) analysis of policy&#13;
alternatives; (iii) evaluation of the impact of regional and sector investments on&#13;
municipal finance; and, (iv) project coordinating unit. The project will, during four&#13;
years, finance a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) with approximately 12 staff, within&#13;
the State Chancellery, to implement, coordinate, and oversee the project components and&#13;
their specific programs. This sub-component will also support the initial investment and&#13;
operating costs of the Municipal Development Fund (MDF).&#13;
Component II: Physical Investments (US$20.4 million of which IDA credit US$16.3 million)&#13;
The project will finance municipal investments listed in the Priority Investments Plan (PIP)&#13;
within the framework of the Municipal Development Agreement. The investments include, but&#13;
are not limited to, construction rehabilitation and maintenance of public infrastructure (primary&#13;
and secondary) facilities, and services under the responsibility of local government, particularly:&#13;
(a) roads, drainage, lighting, etc.;&#13;
(b) water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management;&#13;
(c) revenue generating facilities (markets, bus stations, etc.);&#13;
(d) social facilities( health center, schools, etc.);&#13;
(e) administrative/cultural facilities (rehabilitation of historic properties).&#13;
The eligibility criteria for investment projects were confirmed during Negotiations [see para.&#13;
6.1 b].&#13;
Selection of Participating Municipalities&#13;
2.5    The main objective of the selection process was to select municipalities that are&#13;
representative and have a high probability of successfully generating and implementing useful&#13;
development schemes that could be replicable and transferable to other municipalities. To&#13;
achieve the project objectives, the following selection criteria were applied:&#13;
(a)  demonstrated willingness to reform;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(b) basic financial and administrative capacity to implement the development program;&#13;
(c) geographical distribution (at least one municipality per region).&#13;
2.6    Based on the criteria above, 23 municipalities were selected to benefit from the proposed&#13;
MDDP and classified in a sample of priority candidates (11 municipalities) and a sample of&#13;
"reserve" candidates (12 municipalities). Out of the priority list, three municipalities have yet to&#13;
be identified for the pilot phase and immediate access to the project. Annex 3 provides the list of&#13;
all participating municipalities. This list would be updated periodically and revised during the&#13;
Mid-Term Review. At this initial stage, the urban population targeted under the project is&#13;
estimated at 2,3 million (approximately 75% of the total urban population).&#13;
2.7   In line with the objective - shared between the GoG and the Bank - of ensuring a&#13;
transparent and fair selection process and in order to comply with the Government's stated&#13;
purpose of ensuring a homogenous geographic distribution of the project's benefits, the&#13;
following selection mechanism was adopted: (i) in the course of a workshop organized ad hoc,&#13;
the 10 special representatives of the President in the Regions (Governors) were asked to submit -&#13;
to the RPMS and the Bank - a shortlist of two priority candidates among the municipalities under&#13;
their respective jurisdiction (one primary candidate and one "reserve" for each region, plus&#13;
Tbilisi, for a total of 23). The representatives (mayors or deputy mayors) of these municipalities&#13;
were invited by the RPMS for a follow-up workshop during which the local representatives have&#13;
been fully briefed on the proposed MDDP's objectives and design and on the competitive,&#13;
performance-based principles that will apply to the project's implementation. All 23 potential&#13;
beneficiary municipalities are marked on the attached map.&#13;
(A) Institutional Development Component&#13;
2.8    Annex 3 provides a comprehensive presentation of the project concept and design. The&#13;
project's main features can summarized as follows:&#13;
(a) Each participating municipality will submit a request to the Program Coordination Unit&#13;
stating its willingness to undergo a Municipal Audit. The MA will be executed by local&#13;
auditing firms selected from the list of auditors licensed by the Parliamentary Auditing&#13;
and Accounting Committee. The audit will be carry out according to the Operational&#13;
Manual and will achieve the following: (a) review of the financial situation of the&#13;
municipalities, (b) identify potential sources of revenue, and (c) highlight gaps in terms&#13;
of maintenance, services, and infrastructure. The main outcome of the MA is a fair&#13;
assessment of the overall management performance and an evaluation of the municipal&#13;
present investment capacity. A list of potential auditing firms and the terms of reference&#13;
for municipal audits were agreed upon during Negotiations [see para. 6.1 c]. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, the PCU will need to have completed the municipal audit in&#13;
at least three municipalities [see para. 6.4d]. This would allow the PCU to rapidly carry&#13;
out the next steps toward the completion of the three municipalities' respective&#13;
Municipal Development Agreements, in accordance with the norms and procedures&#13;
stated in the Operational Manual.&#13;
(b) On the basis of the auditors' recommendations, the municipality will determine its&#13;
Financial and Administrative Rehabilitation Plan (FARP), and identifying the&#13;
administrative, financial and technical actions to undertake its local adjustment efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
To implement the FARP, the local officials are eligible for support (T.A. and minimum&#13;
computer equipment) from PCU.&#13;
(c) Considering the present financial capacity and expected result of the management&#13;
strategy laid out in the FARP, the local government will propose their Priority&#13;
Investment Plan (PIP). The PIP chief purpose is to present the community's medium-&#13;
term physical development priorities and place specific targeted investments in the&#13;
broader framework of the municipal financial capacity. The FARP and the PIP formats&#13;
were confirmed during Negotiations [see para. 6. Id].&#13;
(d) Finally, the PCU and the municipality officials prepare the Municipal Development&#13;
Agreement which provides a contractual framework for the municipal authorities'&#13;
commitment to reform (as outlined in the FARP and PIP) and the commitment of the&#13;
central government to provide financial support during the implementation of the&#13;
municipal program. This short-term agreement between the local administration and&#13;
central authorities will enable sustainable municipal development through investment&#13;
financing. All participating municipalities are eligible for, but not guaranteed to obtain,&#13;
a Municipal Development Agreement as long as they follow the steps established in the&#13;
Operational Manual. The content and format of the Municipal Development&#13;
Agreement were agreed upon during Negotiations [see para. 6. le].&#13;
Strengthening the central government's implementation capacity&#13;
2.9    Complementary activities are targeted at the central government level as a vehicle to&#13;
support some key functions (i.e., State Chancellery RPMS, Ministry of Finance - Local Budgets).&#13;
The main purpose is to create a conducive environment to implement effectively the planned&#13;
decentralization program and to respond in the most pragmatic way to some specific assistance&#13;
needs of the participating agencies. The support activities program at the central governrment&#13;
level, particularly: T.A., training, and studies was confirmed during Negotiations [see para.&#13;
6.IfI.&#13;
(a) Technical Assistance: The areas of expertise that will be provided through Technical&#13;
Assistance, building up institutional knowledge and capacities, will cover the areas: (i)&#13;
project implementation; (ii) information systems; (iii) municipal finance; (iv) human&#13;
resource management; (v) legal development; (vi) training.&#13;
(b) Training: The PCU will provide, at the request of the municipality or the central&#13;
government entities, administrative and technical training for both municipalities and&#13;
Government agencies. Training of municipal staff, including the development of&#13;
courses and seminars, is included in the respective activities of the MDA. The PCU&#13;
would be responsible for identifying the best management and operational practices,&#13;
both within Georgia and internationally, and for facilitating the dissemination of these&#13;
practices to municipalities and other appropriate organizations.&#13;
(c) Studies: As a complement to the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant dealing&#13;
with the legal framework (Municipal Code) and the preliminary design of the municipal&#13;
accounting system, the MDDP will finance three studies: (i) intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
relationship - property tax (YI of project implementation); (ii) housing strategy and role&#13;
of local governments (Y2); and (iii) urban land development (Y3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.10   Some initial office equipment (computers, UPS, printers, modems, and packages of basic&#13;
software) would be provided to the eligible municipalities and the central government agencies&#13;
participating in the project. This minimal package will enable them to use the computerized and&#13;
standardized management tools and ease comparison between municipalities. It is also aimed at&#13;
facilitating the flow of information through improved communication. Additional equipment&#13;
(trucks, cars, pumps, etc.) could be identified as priority investment in the MDA and proposed to&#13;
the MDF for funding.. These requests would therefore have to go through the investment&#13;
selection/appraisal process. Considering the proposed criteria, purchasing of new equipment&#13;
will appear as a low priority.&#13;
(B) Physical Investments&#13;
2.11   Based on the findings of the municipal audit, each municipality will be able to identify a&#13;
sustainable priority investment plan. The type of investment must be compatible with the&#13;
financial capacity of the municipality, and thus be consistent with the FARP. In order to&#13;
simplify project implementation, a catalog of municipal investment projects will be prepared&#13;
during the pilot phase financed under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). This catalogue would&#13;
be a menu of possible sub-projects including some sample drawings and unit costs. This menu&#13;
will facilitate informed decisions on priority investment matching municipal financing capacity.&#13;
In order to compensate the weak municipal implementation capacity and optimize the local&#13;
project execution experience gained under previous Bank projects, the physical investment&#13;
component would be implemented through contract management arrangements. The&#13;
development of an institutional framework for increasing local government's access to credit and&#13;
technical assistance is considered to be a long term process, the organizational structure evolving&#13;
with time, as more experience is gained.&#13;
The Municipal Development Fund (MDF)&#13;
2.12   MDF finain,Z mechanism. As a revolving        Box 4: Financing Scheme&#13;
fund the MDF is expected to function primarily as a&#13;
mechanism for distributing funds. Administrative     The Municipal Development Fund (MDF)&#13;
procedures and lending terms and conditions are      will supplement municipalities' own&#13;
defined in a detailed Operational Manual (Annex 11   contribution (at least 20%) and a matching&#13;
provides a synopsis of the manual). The MDF will     grant mechanism (40%), by lending to the&#13;
municipality 40% of the total cost of any&#13;
provide funding at diversified interest rates to eligible   given investment. The proposed approach&#13;
municipalities for social and municipal infrastructure    should enable selected municipalities to&#13;
investments throughout Georgia (15% for investments   carry out essential and urgent investments in&#13;
in public goods and 20% for revenue-generating       an efficient and sustainable manner.&#13;
investments) . Specific proposals would be developed&#13;
and submitted by the municipalities following the completion of the municipal audit, the&#13;
preparation of the PIP and the signing of the Municipal Development Agreement with the central&#13;
government. MDF will evaluate the investment proposals on the basis of criteria defined in the&#13;
The interest rate for investments in public goods was computed as follows: 12% (average estimated&#13;
inflation rate for the next two years) + 1.75% (service fee for the MDF) + 1.25% (service charge for&#13;
IDA); 20% for revenue-generating investments: this rate is equivalent to approximately half (50%) of&#13;
the current commercial interest rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Operational Manual. Access to the fund will be granted - on a competitive basis - to&#13;
municipalities whose investment proposals meet strict eligibility criteria (defined in consultation&#13;
with the Government). Past performance on earlier investments will be the chief criterion for&#13;
awarding future credit to a municipality. Following mid-term review, the financing conditions&#13;
may be modified. The overall financing mechanisms, including interest rates and credit&#13;
conditions for municipalities, were confirmed during Negotiations [see para. 6.1 g].&#13;
2.13   Organization and-functions ofMDF. The Municipal Development Fund (MDF) was&#13;
established through a Presidential Decree as an independent legal entity. The Head of the MDF&#13;
will be accountable to an eight-member Coordination Commission drawn from throughout the&#13;
government and the national community (Annex 3 - attachment C). The MDF Unit would carry&#13;
out the financial and economic analysis of the municipal proposals and prepare the appraisal&#13;
document for the MDF Board and maintain the sub-loan account. Based on Bank's experience&#13;
with municipal development funds, the proposed arrangements offer the best guarantees against&#13;
political interference in the financial and economic decision making process. Appropriate T.A.&#13;
will be provide to the MDF under the institutional development component. Close cooperation&#13;
between the PCU and the MDF will be required at all stages of the project and is confirmed by&#13;
the existence of a single Operational Manual. The role, composition, and modus operandum of&#13;
the MDF Coordination Commission, responsible for the MDF's financial decisions, with terms&#13;
of reference satisfactory to IDA, was confirmed during Negotiations [see para. 6.1h].&#13;
Long-term prospects for the MDF&#13;
2.14   The current state of municipal infrastructure and local government management capacity&#13;
in Georgia calls for a rapid mobilization of resources toward investment at the local level. The&#13;
capacity of the country's budding private banking sector, however, is currently very low. Banks&#13;
are not able to respond to the pressing demands of the sector, both in view of the magnitude of&#13;
existing problems and the scarce interest of the private sector in municipal investments. As an&#13;
independent legal entity created for the purposes of implementing investments in the municipal&#13;
sector, the MDF provides an imperfect but rapid and viable solution to the current lack of&#13;
financial resources and mechanisms for infrastructure investments. The proposed funding&#13;
mechanism for individual investments under the project could possibly evolve, over time, into a&#13;
formula closer to conventional infrastructure finance. In line with this long-term development&#13;
orientation and considering that the project will be subjected to local tax regulations, the GoG&#13;
decided that tax payments made by the MDF will be compensated from the national budget. As a&#13;
result, the fiscal impact on the MDF would be neutral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.1     Project Costs. Total project costs including contingencies are estimated at US$26.1 million&#13;
equivalent (excluding contributions sought from donors) of which US$20.9 million equivalent would&#13;
be provided by IDA and US$5.2 million by the MoF and municipalities as local counterpart funding.&#13;
A summary of the cost estimates by component is provided in Tables 3.1 below. Cost estimates by&#13;
expenditure category are presented in Annex 4.&#13;
3.2     The IDA credit will be distributed between the two components of the program: (a)&#13;
institutional development; and (b) physical investments. The institutional development component&#13;
integrates the operating cost of the PCU responsible for implementation of the institutional&#13;
development component, and the MDF, responsible for management and execution of the investment&#13;
component. The physical investment component includes procurement, contract management and&#13;
supervision of civil works and goods. The MDDP will benefit from counterpart contributions of&#13;
approximately 20% of the project's costs from two sources of financing: (i) the central government&#13;
budget in the amount of US$1.1 million equivalent or 4.2% of total project costs (excluding&#13;
contributions sought from donors) will contribute to funding of the institutional development&#13;
component; and (ii) contributions from the participating municipalities in the amount of US$4.1&#13;
million equivalent or 15.7% of total project costs (excluding contributions sought from donors) will&#13;
come in form of the dedicated budget allocations for the investment component.&#13;

3.3     Project cost estimates are based on January 1997 prices. Due to the evolving nature of the&#13;
Georgian economy, all estimated costs are based on the US dollar. Physical contingencies of 9%&#13;
have been applied to base costs (excluding donor funded expenditures). Price contingencies used the&#13;
following estimated average inflation rates to adjust costs during project implementation: 12% for&#13;
1997, 10% for 1998, 6.2% for 1999, and 6% for 2000 and 2001. The estimated total foreign cost is&#13;
US$6.1 million or 33% of total baseline costs. Local cost is estimated at US$12.8 million equivalent&#13;
(excluding contingencies and local contribution) or 70% of total baseline costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
B. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
3.4     Project Financing. The proposed credit of US$20.9 million equivalent would finance about&#13;
80% of the estimated total project cost (excluding contribution sought from donors) including 100 %&#13;
of foreign and 74% of local costs. The Government counterpart financing is US$5.2 million or 20%&#13;
of total project cost (excluding contributions sought from donors). The financing plan is presented in&#13;
Table 3.2. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Borrower would provide evidence to the Bank&#13;
that project accounts for counterpart funding have been opened in a commercial bank acceptable to&#13;
IDA and an initial deposit of US$250,000 (US$200,000 in the Local Contribution Account A for the&#13;
MDF, and US$50,000 in the Local Contribution Account B for the PCU, respectively) has been&#13;
deposited [see para. 6.4c]. The total amount represents approximately 6 months worth of counterpart&#13;
contributions (including tax).&#13;

3.5     The project differentiates between support activities, physical investments, and operating&#13;
costs. Support activities include T.A. and training. Investment costs are civil works and goods.&#13;
Incremental operating costs include costs for project implementation amounting to US$2.1 million&#13;
equivalent or 8% of total project cost (excluding contribution sought from donors). The sustainability&#13;
of the program would be ensured through cost recovery mechanisms described in Chapter V.&#13;
Cofinancing&#13;
3.6     Bilateral donors have been approached by the Government to provide grant financing.&#13;
During Negotiations, the GoG indicated that step will be taken to mobilize additional resources. An&#13;
amount of approximately US$2 million or 7. 1% of total project costs is expected in the medium term.&#13;
In case these funds would be forthcoming, the Government will request IDA to revised the initial&#13;
credit allocation. Technical assistance and training programs would be primarily financed through&#13;
counted upon grant resources while IDA funds would be reallocated to increase the amount of the&#13;
Physical Investment component.&#13;
Financing Plan for Investment&#13;
3.7     The financing plan of municipal investments, through the Municipal Development Fund, is&#13;
based on five principles:&#13;
(a) a coherent program of investment based on a preliminary municipal audit and&#13;
identification of priority needs;&#13;
(b) a realistic matching mechanism of the municipal investment program with the managerial&#13;
and financial capacity of the municipalities;&#13;
(c) a significant financial participation by the municipalities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
(d)  an inclusion in the program of a growing number of municipalities attracted by the&#13;
financing opportunities and the free support/enabling activities; and&#13;
(e)  a global approach to investment financing instead of an operation by operation approach.&#13;
3.8     The investment financing plan consist of a mix of the three classical sources of financing:&#13;
credit, self financing, and grant. The financing arrangements are follows:&#13;
(a)  Type of resources. Financing of the municipal sub-projects includes 40% grants, 40%&#13;
loan, and 20% municipal self-financing.&#13;
(b)  Financing Terms. The maximum amount of the municipal loan would be US$300,000&#13;
equivalent. The maturity of the loan would be limited to a maximum of 10 years and the&#13;
grace period to a maximum of one year.&#13;
(c)  Financing Conditions. Financing conditions may vary according to the category of&#13;
investments and will be financed on the following terms: (i) social investments on&#13;
preferential terms (15 per cent), and (b) revenue generating investments on commercial&#13;
terms (20 per cent). The central government is responsible for repayment of the IDA&#13;
credit which will be partially on-lent, through MDF, to municipalities.&#13;
3.9     The investment volume for each municipality will be a function of its present financial&#13;
capacity and its commitment to additional efforts towards budgetary adjustment, i.e., the volume of&#13;
investments will be linked with the capacity of beneficiaries to contribute to the self-financing&#13;
portion. The financing made available by the MDF out of its own resources or through MDF acting&#13;
as a financial intermediary for other co-financiers will be made available under the same terms and&#13;
conditions.&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
3.10     In order to start project implementation, the Bank approved recently a US$400,000 PPF to&#13;
be disbursed over the next four months. This advance will help establish the executing agencies&#13;
(PCU and MDF) as well as initiated the first institutional development activities (primarily the&#13;
municipal audits).&#13;
Flow of funds&#13;
3.11     In addition to the PCU and MDF interest bearing Local Contribution Accounts (see para.&#13;
3.4), both agencies will open, in coordination with the MoF, two special accounts in commercial&#13;
banks acceptable to the Bank (Special Account "A" for the Municipal Development Fund and Special&#13;
Account "B" for the Project Coordination Unit). Regarding the MDF, each participating municipality&#13;
will contribute to the funding of the local investments on a matching grant basis of 20% of the sub-&#13;
project costs. Eligible municipalities will credit the Local Contribution Account with their specific&#13;
municipal contribution prior to the start of the work. Each deposit from a municipality to its account&#13;
will be recorded in the detailed bank statements of the MDF Local Contribution Account. Also, the&#13;
transfer of funds from municipality to the Local Contribution Account will be recorded in accounting&#13;
books of each municipality. Allocations of the counterpart funds by the MoF will be deposited twice&#13;
a year into the Local Contribution Account B to be used by the PCU.&#13;
&#13;

IV.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.1     The institutions directly involved in implementing the project will be: (a) the Department of&#13;
Local Government - State Chancellery which will take responsibility of the political aspects of the&#13;
decentralization process; (b) the Municipal Development Fund, which will manage the financing of&#13;
municipal investments within the framework of Municipal development Agreement; and (c) the&#13;
Contract Management Consultants, which are independent contractors assisting the MDF and the&#13;
municipalities in the procurement of civil works, equipment and technical assistance.&#13;
4.2     The implementation arrangements are designed to make best possible use of existing&#13;
institutional capacity, provide for focused project implementation, and be transitional in nature with&#13;
respect to the functions to be fulfilled by local governments. Implementation arrangements also reflect&#13;
the project's aim to strengthen management capacity of local government and private sector operators.&#13;
The institutional arrangements are further described in Annex 8.&#13;
Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
4.3     In additional to the municipality, the project will be implemented through three main entities:&#13;
PCU, MDF, and Contract Management Consultants (CMC). Annex 3 details further the project's&#13;
institutional arrangements. Their respective responsibilities are summarized below:&#13;
(a)  PCU - RPMS (President's Regional Policy and Managagement Service). Project&#13;
Coordination Unit will be responsible for the implementation of the MDDP's institutional&#13;
development component. This entity will be established by a Presidential Decree approving&#13;
PCU's Charter and appointing its Executive Director. The Charter defines the&#13;
responsibilities, objectives and structure of the Unit as well as the role of the PCU in the&#13;
implementation and coordination of the activities under the MDDP Project. The PCU will&#13;
function, as a separate entity, under the supervision of the Head of the RPMS and will be&#13;
accountable to the President of Georgia and the State Investment Council. The PCU&#13;
Executive Director, former Deputy Governor of the Kakheti Region, was selected after&#13;
consultation with the Bank. The main functions the PCU will be to: (a) support and oversee&#13;
all program implementation, including quality assurance; (b) coordinate and manage the&#13;
various institution and capacity building activities; (c) secure funding for project technical&#13;
assistance; (d) produce consolidated management reports to the Bank for the project; and (e)&#13;
ensure that Bank guidelines and procedures are followed. In fulfilling its role as the&#13;
implementation unit, PCU team will assign, as a minimum, and at all times, the following&#13;
staff to undertake project implementation activities: (a) Executive Director, as project&#13;
manager; (b) development director as assistant project manager; (c) financial director; (d)&#13;
accountant; (e) legal experts; (g) training organizers; (g) MIS specialist; and (h) support staff.&#13;
The PCU Executive Director will be assisted by properly qualified and experienced&#13;
consultants hired on a fixed term basis. As a condition for Negotiations, the Borrower&#13;
transmitted to the Bank the draft Decree establishing the Project Coordination Unit and its&#13;
charter [see para. 6.2]. As a condition of Board Presentations, the Borrower transmitted to&#13;
the Bank the signed copy of Decree establishing the Project Coordination Unit, its charter,&#13;
and the decision appointing the PCU Executive Director [see para. 6.3].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
(b)  MDF. The MDF is established by a Presidential Decree approving its Charter and&#13;
appointing its Executive Director. As an autonomous legal entity, acting under the&#13;
supervision of the Coordination Commission, the Municipal Development Fund will be&#13;
responsible of reviewing proposals prepared by the municipalities for financing in&#13;
accordance with agreed MDA, criteria, and procedures. The MDF will work in close&#13;
cooperation with the MoF in order to coordinate municipal and regional finance policies, tax&#13;
and levies management procedures, and intergovemmental fiscal transfers. The MDF will&#13;
hire independent Contract Management Consultants to assist in the procurement of civil&#13;
works, equipment and spare parts, and consultant services for the sub-projects. To carry out&#13;
its function of financial institution, the MDF team will assign, as a minimum, and at all&#13;
times, the staff with expertise in financial and banking technic, economic analysis and civil&#13;
engineering. The MDF Executive Director, former Bank financed projects Director, was&#13;
selected after consultation with the Bank. The costs of these staff will be paid out of the&#13;
project and will be covered through an administrative mark-up on loan funds to be charged&#13;
by the MDF. As a condition of Negotiations, the Borrower transmitted to the Bank the draft&#13;
Decree establishing the Municipal Development Fund and its charter [see para. 6.2]. As a&#13;
condition of Board Presentation, the Borrower would transmitted to the Bank the signed copy&#13;
of Decree establishing the Municipal Development Fund, its charter, and the decision&#13;
appointing the MDF Executive Director [see para. 6.3].&#13;
(c)  CMCs. In view of the lack of familiarity of Georgian municipalities with the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines, which may cause them difficulties in handling Bank-financed&#13;
procurement, the use of CMCs is considered central to the success of the MDDP, especially&#13;
in the procurement of civil works which are likely to be of supply and installation nature.&#13;
The role of the Contract Management Consultants (CMCs) is critical to the successful&#13;
implementation of the physical component. The Selection of CMCs will be made by an&#13;
Evaluation Committee chaired by the Executive Director of the MDF and including&#13;
representatives from the concerned Municipalities, the MDF itself and the PCU. The CMCs&#13;
will be generally responsible for: (i) consulting with the relevant Technical Departments of&#13;
the municipality and with the MDF to assess the preparedness of the specific investment&#13;
project; (ii) on behalf of the MDF, providing assistance to the municipality in packaging the&#13;
bidding documents; and (iii) provide procurement training to the municipality. Once a sub-&#13;
project is approved by the MDF Coordination Commission, a CMC will initiate the&#13;
procurement process. During the project implementation phase, his main function will be the&#13;
monitoring and control of the day-to-day contract implementation process in coordination&#13;
with the municipalities. One of the main criteria for the selection of the CMCs will be their&#13;
experience in Bank-financed projects and their working knowledge of the Bank's&#13;
Procurement guidelines for goods and consultants. Contract management arrangements for&#13;
implementation of investment activities were confirmed during Negotiationsjsee para. 6.1 k].&#13;
Project Implementation Plan and Operating Procedures&#13;
4.4     The Borrower's Project Implementation Plan includes arrangements for the timely provision&#13;
of all necessary inputs, adequate staffing of PCU and MDF, key activities, an estimated time-table of&#13;
implementation of adequate financial management procedures, specification of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system, performance indicators and implementation of other operational procedures required&#13;
for effective project execution. Arrangements for project implementation, including an implementation&#13;
plan, procurement and disbursement arrangements, and reporting requirements were confirmed during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Negotiations [see para. 6.1 1]. According to agreements reached during negotiations, the Borrower is&#13;
finalizing detailed guidelines and operating procedures in the Operational Manual (OM) for the PCU,&#13;
MDF, and other organizations (i.e., Contract Management Consultants) involved in implementing&#13;
project components. As a condition for Credit Effectiveness, the Operational Manual shall have been&#13;
adopted - for the MDF - by the Coordination Commission and -for the PCU - by the RPMS. Ensuring&#13;
that the PCU and theMDF will follow these procedures throughout project implementation will be a&#13;
covenant to the Credit Agreement [see para. 6.4a].&#13;
B.    MONITORING, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.5     Project monitoring will be the responsibility of PCU and MDF, contracting out most of these&#13;
functions, as appropriate. Separate studies to monitor issues related to poverty impact assessment,&#13;
project related private sector development, etc. may also be commissioned by PCU. PCU and MDF&#13;
will furnish the Bank with reports on a regular basis including: (i) quarterly progress and project&#13;
financial management reports; (ii) interim unaudited statements of project accounts kept by PCU; and&#13;
(iii) additional information that the Bank may request from time to time. MDF and PCU's financial&#13;
statements will also be provided annually.&#13;
4.6     Performance monitoring will be undertaken by the Bank. To ensure close monitoring of the&#13;
achievements of project objectives during implementation, a set of key performance indicators were&#13;
developed, respectively, for (i) the MDDP's overall Development Objectives and (ii) the PCU and the&#13;
MDF (see Annex 9). These performance indicators will be examined during supervision missions and&#13;
through periodic reports by the Borrower. Performance indicators to monitor project success were&#13;
confirmed at negotiations [see para. 6.1m].&#13;
4.7     In addition, the Government and the Bank will have annual reviews to exchange views on the&#13;
status of project implementation, particularly regarding: (a) performance of the PCU implementation&#13;
unit and project implementation procedures agreed with the Bank; and (b) adjustments in the project&#13;
that may be required to improve implementation of its objectives, including allocation of financing&#13;
between project components. To facilitate project initiation, a project launch mission will take place&#13;
soon after credit effectiveness. Consultant performance will be evaluated based on quality and&#13;
timeliness in the completion of tasks, and transfer of relevant skills to local communities. By July 3 1,&#13;
1999, the MDF and PCU will undertake a comprehensive mid-term review, and refine project design&#13;
together with the Bank, as appropriate. A thorough project evaluation will be undertaken at that stage&#13;
to determine if project design, implementation arrangements, or terms and conditions should be revised&#13;
in order to better meet the needs. Overall, the scope of the mid-term review will include: (i) a&#13;
comprehensive assessment of the MDDP's progress as measured against the agreed development&#13;
objectives and key performance indicators; (ii) the financing and cofinancing arrangements; and (iii)&#13;
the desirability of expanding the Project's geographic scope to Abkhazia and South Ossetia if the&#13;
political-strategic situation at that time permits it, based on the assessment of both the Borrower and the&#13;
Bank. Final project evaluation will be undertaken after project completion. Confirmation of mid-term&#13;
review and sequencing of the reviews was agreed upon at negotiations [see paras 6.1 n].&#13;
4.8     As this is the second Bank-supported investment credit in the municipal sector and&#13;
considering the limited local experience, the project is expected to require a significant supervision&#13;
effort. Therefore, it is planned that about 26 staff weeks would be required for supervision for the first&#13;
year, and about 18 staff weeks in each of the following three years. A detailed supervision plan is&#13;
included as Annex 8. The supervision schedule was confirmed at negotiations [see para. 6.1o].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
C.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
4.9     Procurement activities under the project will fall under one of the following areas: (i) works;&#13;
(ii) goods; (iii) consultants needed for institutional and other capacity building programs and for&#13;
implementing the project activities.&#13;
a. Procurement Responsibilities&#13;
4.10     Procurement procedures utilized in Georgia are mostly based on the arrangements which&#13;
prevailed under central planning in the former Soviet Union, and are not appropriate under IDA-&#13;
financed projects. However, Georgia has acquired limited experience with procurement practices over&#13;
the last three years. Although the country lacks an effective legal and institutional framework for&#13;
public procurement, the current practices and regulations applied in the public and private sectors as&#13;
well as plans to introduce public procurement legislation are under consideration. The present&#13;
shortcomings will be remedied through: (i) the employment of an experienced procurement specialist;&#13;
(ii) a detailed Operational Manual for procurement processes; (iii) use of independent Contract&#13;
Management Consultants for procurement of sub-project; and (iv) the mandatory use of the Bank's&#13;
(and the Region's) Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). Detailed TORs for the CMC will be included&#13;
in the Operational Manual.&#13;
b. Role of Contract Management Consultants&#13;
4.11     CMCs will be responsible for contract administration on behalf of the MDF and the&#13;
concerned municipalities. For each specific subproject, responsibilities of the CMC will, inter alia,&#13;
include: (a) training of municipal staff and developing monitoring procedures for the municipalities'&#13;
use in managing procurement and disbursement; (b) detailing the procurement plan (types of goods,&#13;
quantities, estimates, delivery requirements, procurement schedule); (c) preparing technical&#13;
specifications of materials and equipment required; (d) preparing specific bid documents based on the&#13;
Bank's standard documents, including notifications of bidding opportunities; (e) preparing terms of&#13;
reference and finalizing documents for hiring consultants according to models prepared by the Bank;&#13;
(f) participating in the evaluation of bids and proposals received together with the municipality, the&#13;
MDF and the PCU and in the preparation of evaluation reports; (g) advising on contracts with&#13;
successful bidders and selected consultants; (h) contract administration on behalf of the MDF and the&#13;
concerned Municipality; and (i) providing, upon request, on-the-job training to staff from the&#13;
purchasing units of beneficiaries in order to gradually develop its capabilities in handling international&#13;
procurement.&#13;
c. Methods of Procurement&#13;
4.12     The MDDP's operation in terms of procurement will be split among two broad categories:&#13;
(i) a credit line for approximately US$16 million to participating municipalities for financing of&#13;
municipal sub-projects; and (ii) funding for the institutional development component (US$5.6 million)&#13;
which will be allocated for various consultant services and minor equipment needs for the PCU and&#13;
MDF's implementation units. While it is not possible to list the procurement packages under municipal&#13;
sub-projects component, the following procurement methods and thresholds will govern. A detailed&#13;
Operational Manual is being prepared, which will incorporate detailed procurement procedures agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
between agreed between IDA and the borrower and incorporated in the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement. The Manual would be subject to prior Bank review. A summary of the procurement&#13;
arrangements is provided in Tables 4.1 below.&#13;

lb The Municipal sub-projects are estimated to cost between $300,000 and US$ 1.0 million. The procurement for&#13;
these sub-projects will be governed under Bank Guidelines, January 1995. Most of the sub-projects represent&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of civil works. There may also be some Supply and Installation of equipment. The&#13;
precise procurement method to be used will depend upon the contract value: all works contracts above US$0.5&#13;
million will be through ICB and contracts below that threshold will be through NCB.&#13;

L. Good&#13;
(i) Contracts for the supply of goods and equipment (computer equipment, including UPS&#13;
equipment, and software, vehicles, office furniture, cabinets, security equipment, etc.)&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$ 200,000 shall be awarded on the basis of international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.&#13;
(ii) Contracts estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000 shall be awarded on the basis of&#13;
International Shopping (IS) on the basis of quotations from a minimum of 3 suppliers from&#13;
at least 2 different countries, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Contracts for the procurement of items or groups of items to cost less than US$ 50,000 may&#13;
be awarded on the basis of National Shopping (NS), depending on the availability of such&#13;
items in Georgia. In this case, a minimum of 3 quotations should be obtained.&#13;
(iii) Direct contracting, irrespective of the contract amount, may be used, with the Bank's prior&#13;
approval, under the following circumstances: (a) the required equipment or spare parts will&#13;
have to be compatible with existing equipment. For such purchases to be justified, the&#13;
original equipment should be suitable and the advantages of having another make of&#13;
equipment should have been considered and found unsuitable; and (b) the equipment is of&#13;
proprietary nature and obtainable only from one source.&#13;
4.13     Domestic Preferences. In the evaluation of bids for equipment purchased under ICB bids&#13;
offering Georgian manufactured goods would be granted a margin of preference of fifteen (15) percent&#13;
or the amount of duties and other related import charges which a non-exempt importer would have to&#13;
pay for the importation of the goods offered in Georgia, whichever is lower, as specified in Appendix 2&#13;
of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.&#13;
11. Civil works&#13;
4.14     Civil works contracts are expected to be small (average value estimated at US$300,000&#13;
equivalent), with no contract exceeding US$ 1,000,000 equivalent. The precise nature of the works is&#13;
not known at this stage; however, it is anticipated that most of the contracts would relate to&#13;
rehabilitation and construction, and there may also be a few supply and installation of equipment&#13;
contracts. Procurement of works will be governed under following thresholds:&#13;
(i) IXC: Civil works estimated to cost US$500,000 and more shall be procured on the basis of&#13;
ICB procedures and by using Bank's standard bidding documents and evaluation report&#13;
formats. Bidders for supply and installation contracts will be prequalified in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of Paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 of the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
(ii) NCB: Works with an estimated value of US$500,000 and less will be procured on the basis&#13;
of National Competitive Bidding. Contractors for works estimated to cost UIS$300,000 and&#13;
more shall be prequalified in accordance with Paragraph 2.9 and 2.10 of the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
One of the main criteria for prequalification would be the actual experience of contractors in&#13;
works of similar nature and volume, financial capacity, and the technical competence. The&#13;
works under NCB shall be advertised in national newspapers. Foreign contractors shall be&#13;
permitted to participate in the bidding. The borrower shall use the Bank's SBDs for smaller&#13;
works and the standard evaluation report formats of 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
III TA and Consulting Services&#13;
4.15     Consulting services would be required under the project's Institution Development&#13;
Component as well as for the investment feasibility studies (municipal sub-projects). These services&#13;
extend to project implementation support (US$1.66 million) and technical feasibility studies (US$ 1.28&#13;
million). Annex 6 presents a description of consulting services required. Most of the consulting&#13;
assignments will be contracted on the basis of QCBS criteria. However, some of the assignments under&#13;
the institutional development component and the selection of Contract Management Consultants for&#13;
procurement of works and goods for Municipal sub-projects, shall be procured on Quality-based&#13;
selection. Other methods to be used in the consultant selection will include: (i) Least-cost for simple&#13;
assignments estimated to cost US$200,000 or less; and (ii) Individual Consultants for services or tasks&#13;
that are of a short duration and where employment of consulting firms may not be necessary or&#13;
economical. Training required for PCU , MDF, and other stakeholders involved in implementing the&#13;
project will be procured from firms with expertise in the respective technical field and will follow the&#13;
Bank's Consultant Guidelines, 1997. The borrower will use the Bank's standard LOI and the contract&#13;
formats in processing consultant selections.&#13;

4.16          The net operating costs (US$ 1.7 million) proposed to be financed out of the IDA&#13;
Credit represent staff salaries, recurring costs, rents, and supplies for the PCU and the MDF units. The&#13;
selection of staff, their salaries, and benefits, at the two Units will be in accordance with procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The reimbursement of these costs will be on the basis of annual budgets for each&#13;
implementing unit to be approved by the IDA. Any supplies should be procured in accordance with NS&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Procurement Review&#13;
4.17     The first three contracts, and for contracts above US$200,000, for goods and works awarded&#13;
ICB, IS, NS and NCB procurements would be subject to prior Bank review. Any consulting contract in&#13;
excess of US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 10,000 for individuals would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review procedures. These limits are expected to result in prior review of about 70 percent of total Bank&#13;
financed procurement. Also, regardless of the value, terms of reference for all technical assistance and&#13;
consultants' contracts would be reviewed in advance by the Bank. This relatively extensive review of&#13;
procurement packages is considered necessary because of the inexperience of the beneficiaries in Bank&#13;
procurement procedures. Other procurement (about 20%) would be subject to the Bank's post review&#13;
during supervision of the project in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
Procurement Plan and Monitoring&#13;
4.18     Procurement plans for major procurement packages are presented in Annex 6. Procurement&#13;
data will be collected and recorded by PCU and MDF. The Project Launch Workshop, including&#13;
training in procurement, would be scheduled as close as is feasible to credit effectiveness, tentatively&#13;
December 1997. Procurement training of PCU and MDF staff, preparation of final bidding documents&#13;
and procurement plan would be undertaken with the assistance of a procurement expert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
4.19     Notifications. For works above US$1 million procured under ICB, a "General Procurement&#13;
Notice" containing information about bidding opportunities for procurement will be published in&#13;
"Development Business". NCB procedures will be advertised in local newspapers following the&#13;
directives of the Operational Manual.&#13;
4.20     Project Implementation Unit (US$1.5 million). The operating costs of PCU and MDF will&#13;
be financed at 100% by the credit. The individuals will be selected according to the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
D.    DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.21     All disbursements would be against standard documentation as described in the Bank's&#13;
Disbursement Handbook. No standard disbursement profile exists for projects in Georgia or in the&#13;
region. Disbursements will be administered by PCU and MDF, receiving funds from Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MoF). The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed as presented in Table 4.2 below.&#13;

bl Incremental costs include MDF and PCU's operating costs.&#13;
4.22     Disbursements are expected to be completed in four years, based on a conservative estimate&#13;
of time required to complete the micro-project activities covered by the project. The estimated closing&#13;
date is June 30, 2001. The proceeds of the Credit are expected to be disbursed in accordance with the&#13;
schedule summarized in Table 4.3 below.&#13;

4.23     Statements of Expenditure. Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs) for contracts for goods below US$200,000. Also, for consulting firms for&#13;
contracts below US$100,000, and for individual consultants for contracts under US$50,000,&#13;
disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), and for incremental&#13;
operating costs, regardless of the amount. The documentation to support these expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
would be retained by PCU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year&#13;
in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review by&#13;
the Bank and auditors upon request. Full documentation would be required for withdrawals for&#13;
contracts above the SOE threshold levels. PCU will ensure that all supporting documentation is&#13;
adequately maintained and available for review at the request of the Bank.&#13;
4.24     Special Account. The MDDP will open two special accounts, the Special Account "A" for&#13;
the Municipal Development Fund and the Special Account "B" for the Program Coordination Unit, in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.25     The maximum authorized allocation of the SA "A" managed by the MDF would be&#13;
US$800,000. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the SA would be limited to&#13;
US$500,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the credit have reached the level of&#13;
SDRI .08 million (equivalent to US$1,5 million), the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$800,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
4.26     The maximum authorized allocation of the SA "B" managed by the PCU would be&#13;
US$500,000. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the SA would be limited to&#13;
US$300,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the credit have reached the level of&#13;
SDR722,000 (equivalent to US$1 million) the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized&#13;
allocation of US$500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
4.27     Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when&#13;
one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements&#13;
for replenishments would follow the standard Bank procedures as described in the Disbursement&#13;
Handbook. Monthly bank statements of the SAs, reconciled by the Borrower, would accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
E.    ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
4.28     Financial Management. The Borrower and PCU, in its capacity as the PIU, and the MDF&#13;
will be responsible for maintaining an adequate financial management systems. Financial management&#13;
systems will include accounting, financial reporting and auditing systems. MDF and PCU, on behalf of&#13;
the Borrower, will ensure that accurate and timely information regarding project resources and&#13;
expenditures can be provided to the Bank.&#13;
4.29     Accounting. Accounting information submitted to the Bank by PCU and MDF will comply&#13;
with international accounting standards acceptable to the Bank. Acrual accounting, used by PCU and&#13;
MDF for their own financial management purposes, will be used for project accounting. Project&#13;
accounts will be maintained by PCU and MDF separately from any other existing accounts. Both units,&#13;
MDF and PCU, having the responsibility for orderly and efficient recording and safeguarding of the&#13;
project assets and resources will: (a) ensure accountability for project funds; (b) maintain records of the&#13;
sources of funds, and the relevant accounts, broken down into the various types of expenditure for the&#13;
project; (c) maintain internal controls to ensure that financial records are reliable, complete and&#13;
provided on a timely basis; (d) report on the use of funds; (e) facilitate verification of these reports by&#13;
independent auditors; and (f) provide information, as required, to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.30     Financial Reporting. The Bank discussed, during project appraisal, the requirements for&#13;
financial management systems, including accounting, project progress reporting, and auditing.&#13;
Reporting templates prepared by PCU and MDF were reviewed and have been integrated in the&#13;
Procedures Manual. Based on the agreed format, it was agreed that during project implementation,&#13;
PCU and MDF will submit a quarterly Project Financial Management Report to the bank. The Report&#13;
will include: (a) Project Progress Report showing comparisons of actual physical and financial progress&#13;
vs. forecasts, and updated six month project forecast; (b) Project Financial Statement including source&#13;
and application of funds; expenditure by category statement; and special account reconciliation&#13;
statement; and (c) Procurement Management Report showing procurement status and contract&#13;
commitments. PCU's Project Implementation Plan will describe further the project financial&#13;
management systems and the Project Financial Management Report. During Negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower provided evidence that a an operational reporting and accounting system for the project&#13;
implementation offices was established [see para. 6.1 p]. Evidence that the management and&#13;
information systems, acceptable to IDA, are operational and integrated in the management and&#13;
accounting systems will be a condition of credit effectiveness [see para. 6.4b].&#13;
4.31     Auditing. PCU and MDF will be responsible, on behalf of the Borrower, for providing to the&#13;
Bank, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year (including the fiscal year of the final Bank&#13;
disbursement) the financial, managerial, and technical audits of the Project that are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. PCU and MDF audit arrangements, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, were&#13;
confirmed during Negotiations [see para. 6. Iq].&#13;
4.32     Financial Audit:. PCU and MDF will have the required Financial Staternents for each year&#13;
audited in accordance with standards that are acceptable to the Bank. An audit of such financial&#13;
statements will include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems&#13;
to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and ensure safeguarding of project-financed&#13;
assets; (b) a determination whether PCU has maintained adequate documentation of all relevant&#13;
transactions; and verification that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing under&#13;
the project, and identification of any ineligible expenditures. The use of a special account (SA) and&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs) will be addressed separately in the auditor's opinion. PCU and&#13;
MDF will ensure that records and accounts of the project will be audited by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, according to standards on auditing that are acceptable to the Bank. The auditor&#13;
will be appointed in sufficient time to carry out its responsibilities, including: (a) a review of the&#13;
financial management systems at the beginning of project implementation; and (b) periodical reviews&#13;
of the project financial management systems thereafter. The Bank-required audits will not cover&#13;
possible donor-funded activities, even if supervised by the Bank.&#13;
4.33     Technical and Procurement Review. The procurement and technical review of MDF&#13;
activities will be carried out of a sample number of municipal projects in differing regions at differing&#13;
stages of the municipal project cycle. The auditor would ensure that the sample also covers municipal&#13;
projects that have used different implementation modes. The auditor should visit sites of selected&#13;
municipal projects and discuss with all participants involved in municipal project selection,&#13;
identification and implementation to ensure a correci basis for his opinion. In conducting their&#13;
review, the experts should pay special attention to the following:&#13;
(a)  All funds have been used in accordance with conditions of the relevant Municipal&#13;
Development Agreement and consequent contracts and according to regulations described in&#13;
the Operational Manual, with due attention to economy and efficiency and only for the&#13;
purposes for which the financing was provided. Relevant agreements refer to all relevant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Municipal Development Agreements signed by the PCU and the MDF with their&#13;
implementing partners, contractors, suppliers or consultants for the provision of works,&#13;
goods or services required for municipal project implementation;&#13;
(b)  Goods, works, and services have been financed by the Implementing Agencies in&#13;
accordance with (i) the above relevant Municipal Development Agreement and (ii)&#13;
acceptable payment procedures;&#13;
(c)  All necessary supporting documents, records and accounts have been kept in respect of all&#13;
municipal project expenditures by the Implementing Agencies; clear linkages should exist&#13;
between the books of account and reports presented by the Municipality to the Fund; and&#13;
(e)  All procurement methods have been conducted in a transparent and fair manner giving all&#13;
potential participants at the local and international level a chance to participate in&#13;
procurement-related activities in accordance with procurement procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA and agreed within the Municipal Development Agreement.&#13;
4.34   The Appointment of the financial and technical auditors, acceptable to IDA, is scheduled&#13;
within the first quarter of project implementation.&#13;

V.    PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    The project, the second IDA's intervention in the municipal sector in Georgia, will&#13;
contribute to the improvement of quality of municipal services and basic infrastructure, a&#13;
strategy set up as a priority in the Bank's CAS and in the Georgia's State Municipal&#13;
Development Program. The MDDP design integrates the Bank-wide lessons from previous&#13;
experience in the municipal sector. More specifically, the main benefits of the project will&#13;
include: (a) support for the decentralization process and promotion of a more active role for&#13;
municipalities, (b) facilitation of improved municipal financial performance and contribution to&#13;
national instituti-onal development objectives through a reduction of the public sector deficit; and&#13;
(c) impact on the urban population - economically and socially - through: (i) reduced costs-and&#13;
better access to municipal services, and (ii) employment generation.&#13;
Component I: Institutional Development&#13;
The main benefit of this component will be more efficient and effective municipal&#13;
management at the national and local level achieved through stimulating the capacity of central&#13;
and local governments to rationally program, finance, manage and maintain facilities and&#13;
delivery of services. In particular, the component will support and encourage local governments&#13;
to assume their municipal responsibilities.&#13;
-  Fiscal impact through better policy: This component will provide the central and local&#13;
governments with the tools needed to: (i) formulate more effective policies; (ii) optimize&#13;
resources allocation; and (iii) improve the efficiency of fiscal expenditures comprising a&#13;
substantial percentage of GDP.&#13;
* Fiscal impact though better municipal management: At the national and local level, the&#13;
component will contribute to national institutional development objectives through a&#13;
reduction of the public sector deficit.&#13;
(a)  At the national level, the benefits will consist of (i) study and analysis of municipal&#13;
policy alternatives; (ii) intergovernmental fiscal relationship; and (iii) evaluation&#13;
of the impact of regional and sector investments on municipal finance.&#13;
(b)  At the municipal level, the benefits will include:(i) municipal management&#13;
improvements reflected in MDAs for participating municipalities; (ii) municipal&#13;
organization improvements including improvement of services to the public,&#13;
development of simplified administrative procedures; (iii) strengthening municipal&#13;
planning and programming procedures.&#13;
* Cost recovyr. Not applicable for this component.&#13;
*  Poty impact. This component will provide the Government with the capacity to&#13;
prevent of further breakdown of vital municipal services. Prevention of further&#13;
degradation of the municipal services, in turn, will yield the following benefits:&#13;
* Maintaining and, in some cases, increasing accessibility and safety of municipal&#13;
services;&#13;
* Introducing elements to increase efficiency of municipal services;&#13;
* Reduction of exposure to diseases, transmittable through water;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
* Provision of the necessary environment for maintaining health care services;&#13;
* Ensuring continuity of educational process through the winter; and&#13;
* Ensuring continuity of educational process through the winter.&#13;
*  Non-project scenario: In the absence of a project, the following could be anticipated:&#13;
and (a) further deterioration of key municipal infrastructure and services; (b) further&#13;
weakening public expenditure management and budget planning procedures at both&#13;
central and local level; (c) less skilled municipal managerial and line staff n the central&#13;
and local level; and (d) loss of credibility of local authorities.&#13;
* Alternatives considered: During project design, the Regional Policy and Management&#13;
Service (RPMS) of the Government undertook a review of its work organization with the&#13;
assistance of the Bank, and assessed a range of options for improving the efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness of the municipal sector at the central and local levels. Options rejected&#13;
included the creation of new Departments in the State Chancellery and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (too expensive and functionally inappropriate)&#13;
*  Beneficiaries: The project will benefit approximately 75% of the urban population,&#13;
particularly in secondary cities which currently endure inadequate levels of services with&#13;
serious environmental risks. Targeting smaller cities and towns will be achieved through&#13;
a ceiling of the project resources accessible to the capital-city. Tbilisi share of the IDA&#13;
credit would be limited to 30%, representing its proportion of urban population.&#13;
*  Monitorina and evaluation: A monitoring plan was prepared during appraisal and agreed&#13;
during negotiations. The Operational Manual includes general indicators for the PCU&#13;
and MDF long-term development objectives and measurement parameters.&#13;
Component II: Physical Investments:&#13;
The project will finance municipal investments listed in the Priority Investments Plan&#13;
(PIP) within the framework of the Municipal Development Agreement. The investments&#13;
include, but are not limited to, construction rehabilitation and maintenance of public&#13;
infrastructure (primary and secondary) facilities, and services under the responsibility of local&#13;
government. New constructions will be limited.&#13;
* Economic analysis: The economic analysis of sub-projects to be financed under the&#13;
municipal development agreements will be an important element of project justification.&#13;
Due to the nature of MDDP and the flexibility built into the system, a traditional&#13;
economic analysis is not feasible. A pragmatic approach will be adopted which consists&#13;
of developing an adequate cost effectiveness methodology based on a sample of some of&#13;
the most traditional municipal sub-projects. A detailed economic analysis will be carried&#13;
out for each investment as an eligibility condition to the MDF and will ensure that the&#13;
best solution in terms of cost and efficiency is selected under the project. The economic&#13;
evaluation will provide the following indications:&#13;
(a) present status of the existing assets (roads, facilities, etc.):&#13;
- inventory of the same type of assets as those projected:&#13;
- population served (indicator of service frequency);&#13;
- management of the existing assets;&#13;
- justification of the priority given with regard to the municipal budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
(b) Demand estimate:&#13;
- complementary expenditures required (land, networks, roads, etc.);&#13;
- standards or objectives to be met (defined by local or national authorities);&#13;
- identification of the inadequacies to be corrected;&#13;
- alternatives considered;&#13;
- justification of the best alternative selected (cost/efficiency ratio);&#13;
- improvement of the level of need satisfaction.&#13;
(c) Cost estimate:&#13;
- size of the investment&#13;
- estimate of investment expenses on the basis of the average cost per beneficiary;&#13;
- selection of the most cost effective solution.&#13;
* Cost recoveY: The IDA credit will set up an institutional framework which overtime&#13;
will contribute to establishing a full cost recovery of the municipal services. The&#13;
Physical Investment Component will be the first step toward implementation of cost-&#13;
recovery scheme. The MDF will supplement municipalities' own contribution of at&#13;
least 20% and a matching grant mechanism 40%, by lending to the municipality 40% of&#13;
the total cost of any given investment. This financing mechanism will provide funding&#13;
at diversified interest rates to municipalities; 15% for investments in public goods and&#13;
20% for revenue-generating investments. The 15 % interest rate for investments in&#13;
public goods was computed as follows: 12% (average estimated inflation rate for the&#13;
next two years) plus 1.75% (service fee for the MDF) plus 1.25% (service charge for&#13;
IDA). The 20% interest rate for revenue-generating investments is equivalent to&#13;
approximately half (50%) of the current commercial interest rate. The on-lent amounts&#13;
will be repayable over a period not to exceed 10 years following a grace period not to&#13;
exceed a year. The proposed approach should enable selected municipalities to carry&#13;
out municipal investments in an efficient and sustainable manner.&#13;
-  Non-proJect scenario: In the absence of the project, the loss of valuable assets would&#13;
further decrease the level and quality of municipal services would be anticipated.&#13;
e Alternatives considered: During the project preparation, the complete financial&#13;
organization and tendering process for the Physical Investment Component were&#13;
developed. Options included (a) designing a program without a MDF and relying,&#13;
instead, on commercial banks; (b) maintaining the MDF, but increasing the share of the&#13;
repayable (loan) component to municipalities; and (c) creating a second independent&#13;
agency in charge of the program management. The first option was rejected due to the&#13;
weakness of the financial sector and the limited creditworthiness of the municipalities.&#13;
As an intermediate step, the MDF is the only financial mechanism which can urgently&#13;
channel investment funds to the municipalities in an efficient and flexible manner&#13;
without distorting the financial sector. Considering the limited financial capacity of&#13;
local governments, the second option is not viable in the present context. However, it&#13;
was felt that a fraction of the investment cost should be financed through credits at&#13;
subsidized interest rates for pedagogical reasons. The third option was rejected because&#13;
an independent agency would not allow to build the necessary capacity for local&#13;
government coordination within the government. Considering the high political stakes&#13;
of any decentralization strategy, this function is better exercised within a central&#13;
government structure. These alternatives would be reconsidered during the mid-term&#13;
review and before designing the next phase (2002 -2006) of the municipal development&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
* Poverty impact - unemployment aspects: Through the investment program financed&#13;
under the project, the impact on the labor market is expected to be very positive,&#13;
particularly in the construction and public work sector, one of the hardest hit during the&#13;
economic transition period. Considering the type of investments, it is expected that the&#13;
low and unskilled labor force will benefit the most from the project. Quantifying&#13;
expected benefits to the most vulnerable groups is problematic due to lack of appropriate&#13;
data and complexity of concepts. The Bank's Georgia Poverty Assessment, to be&#13;
completed in 1997, will facilitate a future evaluation of the project's impact.&#13;
Environmental Impact:. The program includes physical investments identified through a&#13;
programming process. This category B project will facilitate sustainable improvements&#13;
in the living and working environment of Georgia's urban areas. Due to the nature of the&#13;
program, the physical components will not be determined before project effectiveness.&#13;
However, in order to ensure the physical components do not adversely affect the urban&#13;
environment, an environmental impact assessment checklist will be included in the&#13;
Operational Manual. The checklist has the dual advantage of: (a) screening sub-projects&#13;
in a more operational manner than possible with an environmental assessment; and (b)&#13;
enhancing the pedagogical value of raising local government awareness of their projects'&#13;
environmental impact. The standard check list will be used for investments projects&#13;
(Annex 10) and will result in a series of recommendations to be incorporated into the&#13;
design of the investment sub-projects. The fulfillment of these recommendations will be&#13;
supervised by the Contract Management Consultant which reports to the PCU.&#13;
*  Monitoring and evaluation: By July 31, 1999, a comprehensive mid-term evaluation will&#13;
be conducted to refine project design and review replicability of the sub-project&#13;
experience. Also alternative project designs (as listed above) would be reconsidered&#13;
during the mid-term review and before designing the next phase (2002 -2006) of the&#13;
municipal development program. A monitoring plan was prepared during appraisal and&#13;
agreed during negotiations (see Annex 9). The Operational Manual includes a detailed&#13;
plan that outlines key performance indicators and measurement parameters, for the MDF&#13;
physical performance.&#13;
B.    SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
5.2    A long tradition of close family ties and    Box 5: Social Indicators&#13;

refugees who have overloaded existing health and social support services. In the midst of a&#13;
social and economic breakdown that was considered more extreme than any other former Soviet&#13;
republic, living standards in all socioeconomic classes have dropped precipitously since the&#13;
early 1990s.&#13;
5.3    Nonetheless, given its history of maintaining a strong national identity, resilience and&#13;
recovery from hardship, and self-reliant, entrepreneurial behavior, the Georgian society has&#13;
already shown its great potential to overcome the past socio-political crisis and forge a path&#13;
toward sustainable economic development. As IDA second intervention, stemming the further&#13;
deterioration of key municipal infrastructure and services is an important element in alleviating&#13;
poverty and ensuring a minimal social safety net. Indeed, it is the more vulnerable groups, such&#13;
as the sick, the poor, and refugees of war who suffer disproportionately when basic services&#13;
breakdown and the environment degrades. Building on the recent economic recovery and&#13;
political stability, the proposed project will support the government effort to decentralize the&#13;
decision making process and increase community participation in public choice. Additionally,&#13;
rehabilitation of essential municipal infrastructure and services will strengthen the credibility of&#13;
the local authorities, help rebuilt the nation, and consolidate the country's unity&#13;
C.    PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.4    There are short/medium term risks, and long-term strategic risks associated with the&#13;
project, mainly deriving from technical/organizational, institutional, and financial aspects of the&#13;
project and related to overall project acceptance.&#13;
5.5    Technical/organizational risks in the short and medium-term relate to PCU's&#13;
implementation capacity, and the capacity of the municipalities to perform project tasks&#13;
according to targets (see Table 5.1 below). Capacity risks exist in particular with respect to&#13;
reducing the public deficit, mainly through increased revenue collection, and improving the&#13;
municipal management capacity. In order to mitigate these risks , the project design integrates&#13;
specific activities targeting the municipal finance arrangements. The project also incorporates&#13;
the experience gained under previous Bank projects, particularly the MIRP, using the contract&#13;
management arrangements . Additionally, continuous performance monitoring will play an&#13;
important part in mitigating capacity risks.&#13;

5.6    Another identified risks is the possibility that some municipalities may prove ineffective&#13;
or reluctant in following the project objectives. To safeguard against this risk, the municipalities&#13;
were ranked in two categories: priority and reserve lists. This will put competition among&#13;
eligible municipalities. Should there be some initially selected municipalities, not interested or&#13;
capable of fully participating in the project, the large demand for municipal infrastructure and&#13;
the flexibility built into the design of the procedure for allocating funds would permrit shifting&#13;
loan funds to the municipalities with more capacity and/or interest by replacing non-performing&#13;
priority municipalities (by the municipalities from the reserve list).&#13;
5.7    Long-term strategic risks related to technical and procedural aspects of project&#13;
implementation arise from political commitment towards decentralization and municipal&#13;
governance (see Table 5.2 below). While the Government demonstrated a strong ownership of&#13;
institutional reform program, including organization of municipal elections before June 1998,&#13;
initial decisions will have to be confirmed during implementation. At the Mid-Term review, the&#13;
progress made will be assessed and appropriate corrective measures will be proposed, if&#13;
necessary. The second risk concerns the possibility of deterioration in human capital considering&#13;
the very low level of municipal staff salaries. This risk will be addressed through human&#13;
resources restructuring and, if feasible, implementation of appropriate wages in participating&#13;
municipalities.&#13;

To minimize these risks (Rated: Medium Risks), the proposed program will be phased&#13;
and appropriate adjustment will be made based on real progress. Allocation of resources based&#13;
on performance, regular review of the development policy agreement and close monitoring of&#13;
Municipal Development Agreements would make these risks acceptable.&#13;

STATE CHANCELLERY OF GEORGIA&#13;
Mr. Basil Kavalski&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Region&#13;
Country Department IV&#13;
Assistant Director&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
MUNICIPAL SECTOR POLICY LETTER&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.    The symptoms of weakness common to local government institutions in most of the FSU are&#13;
particularly acute in Georgia, because of the mutually reinforcing effects of recent economic recession,&#13;
infrastructure decay, war and the general breakdown of civil order. The most significant problems&#13;
specific to local governments include: (a) a little accountability to residents because of a lack of&#13;
mechanisms allowing constituents to monitor the actions of local officials; (b) a lack of systematic&#13;
internal regulations (most local government units operate on the basis of central government directives;&#13;
(c) inefficiencies in the management of local government functions, caused mainly by an unclear&#13;
allocation of responsibilities among local officials and between units, as well as overstaffing.&#13;
2.     The Government recognizes that any successful strategy aimed at revitalizing the economy and&#13;
social texture of Georgia cannot exclude the establishment of a representative and modem local&#13;
government sector. This principle is explicitly upheld in the Constitution, which states (article 2.4):&#13;
"Georgian Citizens shall arrange local affairs through self-government, without the violation of national&#13;
sovereignty. The rule of establishment of local self-government bodies, their powers and relationships&#13;
with state bodies will be determined by organic law.&#13;
Main Objectives of Institutional Reform&#13;
3.    In view of the above, the Government of Georgia has decided to implement a comprehensive&#13;
decentralization strategy consistent with Georgia's long-term economic and administrative needs. The&#13;
strategy is based on the Municipal Development Program approved by the Government of Georgia and&#13;
its main objectives are described below:&#13;
Solving the issues of local importance through self-governance, based on self-organization of the&#13;
local society. This objective could be achieved through: (i) creation of the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework in conducive for the establishment and development of local self-governance, in accordance&#13;
with the Constitution of Georgia;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 3&#13;
(ii) definition of the nature and scope of the rights and responsibilities assigned to local government&#13;
bodies; (iii) promotion of greater transparency and accountability in local governance; and (iv) clear&#13;
definition of the institutional and economic relationships between the local govemment bodies and the&#13;
central government.&#13;
Development of local social-economic infrastructure, improvement of social services and social&#13;
protection. This could be achieved through: (i) legal and regulatory framework which would clearly&#13;
define the state and municipal property; (ii) promoting the fiscal and economic independence of the local&#13;
government bodies and creating in conducive environment for the local revenue mobilization; (iii)&#13;
improved service delivery for the population, by introducing competition among service providers,&#13;
assessment criteria and better targeted municipal service investments; (iv) improved utilization of local&#13;
resources for the development of local social infrastructure; (iv) establishment of the Municipal&#13;
Development Fund which within the framework of the Municipal Contract will finance the development&#13;
of local social-economic infrastructure; and (v) development of information systems at the local&#13;
government bodies and their integration into the state information system database.&#13;
Progress to Date on Institutional Reform&#13;
4.     The Government and the Parliament of Georgia have already undertaken important steps toward&#13;
a comprehensive reform of the structure and functions of subnational governance in the country. For the&#13;
municipal sector development the most important one was the Presidential Decree No. 362 of September&#13;
16, 1995, which approved a temporary regulation "on Local State Administration Body". The above&#13;
charter laid the foundation for the transition from centralized system to self-governance. The first result&#13;
of this process was the recent preparation of the draft law "On Local Self-govemance and&#13;
Administration", which currently is being discussed at the respective parliamentary committee.&#13;
S.     The draft law above will be discussed in the Parliament in May-June, 1997 and its adoption will&#13;
be the first step towards the introduction of a comprehensive legal framework for local governance. The&#13;
next step implies the preparation of municipal and local elections, definition of the self-governance&#13;
status, preparation of the Laws on Municipal Property, before the end of 1997.&#13;
6.     Since the jurisdiction of Georgia is not completely restored, implementation of the State-&#13;
Territorial Arrangement reform is pending. Nevertheless the Government has already an established&#13;
strategy for this reform, which is aimed at the definition of the roles and functions of the regional&#13;
(highest) level of local administration and differentiation of the competence spheres among different&#13;
governance levels, based on the principles outlined in the Constitution.&#13;
The reform period (2 years) for the implementation of self-govemance and state-territorial arrangement&#13;
is considered by the Government as a transition period. Within this period the main elements of the&#13;
democratic local administration should be implemented.&#13;
Implementation Strategy&#13;
7. In consideration of the above, the Government of Georgia will use the proposed Municipal&#13;
Decentralization and Development Program (MDDP) to support the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 3&#13;
initial phase of the municipal sector reforms. The Government commits itself to the following&#13;
actions/programs:&#13;
a) To adopt the State Municipal Development Program not later than July 1997;&#13;
(b) To preserve the momentum of the current legal reform. This will include, among other actions, the&#13;
following: (i) presentation of the envisaged new laws to Parliament (including any revision to the budget&#13;
law implemented to account for new local government legislation) based on a realistic timetable; (ii)&#13;
transmission to the Bank of all newly approved legislation on local governance; (iii) to held the local&#13;
administration elections ASAP and not later than June 1998;&#13;
(c) To introduce - in a progressive and timely manner - the institutional and regulatory&#13;
framework required for the implementation of new legislation on local government.&#13;
(d) To adopt, in consultation with the Bank, a viable and transparent mechanisms for the transfer of&#13;
central budgetary resources to municipalities targeted for investments under the Municipal Development&#13;
Fund (MDF) component of the proposed MDDP. This will also entail the introduction of clear&#13;
procedures for the establishment of Municipal Contracts between the central government and potential&#13;
beneficiary municipalities outlining the overall objectives of the latter over a period of years.&#13;
(e) To provide - through such legal, institutional and financial measures as may become appropriate over&#13;
time - the explicit overarching objectives of the proposed MDDP, namely: (i) assisting in institutional&#13;
capacity - building toward the implementation of the decentralization process at the central and local&#13;
government level; (ii) promoting the improvement of financial and administrative management as well as&#13;
municipal investment; (iii) supporting urgent local investments; (iv) generating employment&#13;
opportunities; and, (v) creating an environment conducive to private sector involvement in the municipal&#13;
sector.&#13;
The Government of Georgia looks forward to this important development strategy, whose impact - in&#13;
terms of improved governance and more reliable service delivery - will be felt by a large segment of&#13;
Georgia's population.&#13;

INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.    The MDDP would consist of two components: the institutional development&#13;
conponent and the investment component, The institutional development component would&#13;
focus on two priorities: improving municipal management and sthreghtening the central&#13;
government's capacity to implement effectively the planned decentralization program.&#13;
2. The project would consist of the following subcomponents:&#13;
A.    MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUBCOMPONENT&#13;
(US$1.4 million of which IDA Credit US$1.3).&#13;
This component would include the following activities for the municipalities::&#13;
(1)    General Municipal Management Improvement (US$0.5 million), including:&#13;
a. Preparation of Contract Development Agreements (MC) for all 15 municipalities&#13;
participating in the project. This will include: muncipal audits, financial and&#13;
administrative development plan as well as priority investment plan.&#13;
b. Organization and management improvement, including improvement of servies to the&#13;
public, development of simplified administrative procedures, and the implementation&#13;
of methods to increase participation by the poublic in municipal affairs;&#13;
c. Strengthening municipal planning and programming procedures, including the budget&#13;
process.&#13;
d. Human resource planning, including the development of a career and incentives&#13;
structure within municipalities, the definition of training needs, and the strengthening&#13;
of personnel departments..&#13;
e. Physical investment project implementation management, including the design of an&#13;
investment project management system at the municipal level and technical assistance&#13;
to help municipalities maintain and operate the infrastructure under their control.&#13;
f. Sector-specific planning, for example, regarding social programs, the administration of&#13;
subsidies, community services (eg., street lighting, garbage collection, park&#13;
maintenance), health services, and environmental protection. This activity would&#13;
include the development of strategies to enable municipalities to assume more&#13;
effectively responsibilities in sectors that have been or will be transferred to them.&#13;
g. Pre-investment studies, including feasibility studies for investment projects that&#13;
transcend a single municipal jurisdiction, or that would produce particularly good&#13;
results in terms of cost recovery, or that define other innovative investments that&#13;
would help municipalities improve their overall performance.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 4&#13;
(2)    Financial Mangement Strengthening (US$0.6 million), including:&#13;
a. Improvedfinancial planning, including the introduction of new financial planning&#13;
techniques and assistance to help municipalities link capital and multt-annual budgets&#13;
with their development plans.&#13;
b. Improvedfinancial record-keeping, including the introduction of municipal chart of&#13;
account to improve financial control and management accountability.&#13;
c. Design and implementation of simplified land register system, consolidating current&#13;
information about ownership of land, to permit efficient collection of the real estate tax&#13;
and also for land-use planning.&#13;
d. Improved revenue collection, expense control, and cost recovery strategies, including&#13;
the implementation of new procedures to enable timely and complete collection of&#13;
revenue, and the identification of potential sources and methods of cost recovery in the&#13;
selected municipalities.&#13;
(3)   Municipal Management Information Systems (US$0.3 million), including:&#13;
a. Management-oriented information systems. These systems would integrate&#13;
information from the various sectors of a municipality (eg., financial record-keeping&#13;
and land-register), and would progressively become the basis for a cohesive reporting&#13;
system-&#13;
b. Sector-specffic information systems. The project would support the specification,&#13;
acquisition and implementation of information systems needed to address the&#13;
management needs of specific municipal sectors.&#13;
B   NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
(US$4.3 million of which IDA Credit US$3.3).&#13;
(1)    National Information Systems of Municipalities (US$0.2 million), including:&#13;
a. National information system. This subcomponent would involve the design and pilot&#13;
implementation of a nationwide information system on Georgian municipalities, which&#13;
would enable the comparative evaluation of municipalities. The feasibility of creating&#13;
consolidated municipal accounts (a complete and consistent set of accounts for the&#13;
municipal, regional and national levels of government) would be evaluated. General&#13;
guidelines for the development and acquisition of information systems at the&#13;
municipal level would also be provided through this activity to ensure effective and&#13;
efficient information exchange.&#13;
b. Municipal management performance indicators. They will be incorporated into a pilot&#13;
municipal rating system. These performance indicators would be used to rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 4&#13;
municipalities by such criteria as overall efficiency, fiscal discipline, cost recovery,&#13;
debt-carrying capacity, etc.&#13;
c. Evaluation and monitoring system. This activity includes the defimtion and&#13;
implementation of a methodology for evaluating the impact of the project in terms of&#13;
its objectives as well as providing a continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the&#13;
project execution process.&#13;
(2)   Analysis of Policy Alternatives (US$0.3 million), including:&#13;
a. Analysis of municipal policy alternatives. Three activities are planned under this sub-&#13;
component: (i) improving the intergovemmental fiscal relationship, (ii) reforming the&#13;
social housing strategy, (iii) analysing the urban land development policy. The primary&#13;
goal is to improve the incentives in the national/municipal system for more efficient&#13;
management at the municipal level. These activities would analyze exisiting criteria&#13;
for all national/municipal cooperation and seek to identify changes improving&#13;
effectiveness at the municipal level. The feasibility of, and appropriate timing for, the&#13;
introduction of changes would also be assessed.&#13;
b. Analysis of administration policy alternatives. The objective is to improve the&#13;
performance of municipal employees and internal municipal organizational units.&#13;
Recommendations would be developed on choices for possible changes, and on the&#13;
appropriate process for theirimplementation. This activity would be done in&#13;
conjunction or close coordination with the corresponding municipal activity (see&#13;
above).&#13;
c. Multi-yearfinancialplanning. This activity would examine national and&#13;
internationalexperiences in multi-year financial planning to produce a simple manual&#13;
for use at the municipal level. This activity would be done in conjunction or close&#13;
coordination with the corresponding municipal activity (see above).&#13;
(3)    Evaluation Of The Impact Of Regional And Sector Investments On Municipal Finance&#13;
(US$0.1 million), including the analysis of:&#13;
a. Impact of municipal investments in the areas of health, education, housing, and&#13;
infrastructure on other current expenditures.&#13;
b. Needforfurther coordination of these investments within the public sector to prevent&#13;
negative effects on local development.&#13;
(4)   Project Coordinating Unit (US$2.4 million), including&#13;
Management and operational strengthening. Technical assistance would be required by&#13;
the PCU related to its responsibilities for strengthening municipal management and&#13;
increasing the performance in resource mobilization. Review of Municipal Development&#13;
Ageements implementation will alos be part of PCU's responsibility.&#13;

PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE&#13;
The status of local government sector reform&#13;
1.    Since 1995, Georgia has made considerable progress on the path toward local&#13;
government sector reform and the devolution of greater administrative and financial&#13;
responsibilities to subnational territorial entities. While the legal framework for a modem and&#13;
deconcentrated system of local governance is not yet fully in place, recent legislation and&#13;
executive action have laid the foundations for a paced but comprehensive reform policy in the&#13;
sector. The Law of Georgia on Local Self-Government and Administration - which is a modern&#13;
and far-reaching piece of legislation - is about to be introduced and, on the executive side, the&#13;
State Program for Municipal Development (SPMD) presents a preliminary but exhaustive&#13;
strategy for central government assistance (economic, institutional and other) to the local&#13;
government sector, designed by the President's Regional Policy and Management Service&#13;
(RPMS) in full cooperation - and mutual reinforcement - with the Parliament.&#13;
The State Program for Municipal Development&#13;
2.     The SPDM is a relatively comprehensive document outlining the program for local&#13;
government sector reform in Georgia. It was drafted in recognition of the present conditions&#13;
faced by the country with respect to: (i) government organization and structure; (ii) scarce local&#13;
administrative capacity; (iii) wide-spread mistrust of authority; (iv) infrastructure decay and (v)&#13;
concerns related to internal stability. In all these areas Georgia is faced with a compelling&#13;
challenge, which will require the pooling of national and local resources toward long-term&#13;
comprehensive solutions. The SPMD lays out the main procedural steps in the overall proposed&#13;
reform plan in local governance, as follows: (i) preparation of laws and other acts in cooperation&#13;
with Parliament, as well as Presidential decrees; (ii) methodological assistance to local&#13;
government bodies involved in the reform program; (iii) adoption of initial local programs of&#13;
municipal development; (iv) introduction of staff training for local self-government bodies; (v)&#13;
coordination among different state entities involved in the SPMD; (vi) establishment of a local&#13;
information system; and (vi) support to the activity of non-governmental organizations. Toward&#13;
the achievement of the above objectives, the SPMD proposes the establishment of Regional&#13;
Programs for Municipal Development, funded by the central government based on the principle&#13;
of national participation in the rehabilitation of local infrastructure and overall development of&#13;
subnational territorial entities.&#13;
Synergies between the State's reform program and the proposed MDDP&#13;
3.     The MDDP was appraised at a time (May, 1997) when both the Parliament and the&#13;
RPMS were at a crucial juncture in the local government sector reform program. The Law on&#13;
Local Self-Government and Administration was about to be voted on by a plenary session of the&#13;
Legislative, and the SPMD was due for presentation to the Cabinet by the Head of the RPMS. In&#13;
the Municipal Sector Policy Letter (see Attachment 1), which summarizes the Government's&#13;
future reform strategy, the MDDP occupies a central role. The document states that "the&#13;
Government of Georgia will use the proposed Municipal Development and Decentralization&#13;
Program (MDDP) to support the implementation of the initial phase of its municipal sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MDDP                                   46                                 Annex 3&#13;

reforms". In light of this, both the institutional development and the physical investment&#13;
components of the project could have very high returns in terms of capacity building at the&#13;
central and local levels.&#13;
The MDDP Cycle&#13;
4.    The proposed project design (Attachments A-C) attempts to capture and maximize these&#13;
potential - and desired - synergies between the MDDP and the Government's reform program.&#13;
(a)  Supported directly by the State Investment Committee (the highest decision-making&#13;
body in the country with regard to matters of foreign investment and assistance), the&#13;
project will benefit from the immediate and simultaneous involvement of both&#13;
central and local government institutions.&#13;
(see Attachment A).&#13;
(b)  Attachment B describes the process whereby local (municipal) development&#13;
objectives and the central government's overarching policy measures would come&#13;
together within the framework of the MDDP: based on the results of a successful&#13;
comprehensive municipal audit, which will generate afinancial/administrative&#13;
rehabilitation and apriority investment plan, a given beneficiary municipality and&#13;
the central government (through the PCU) would sign a Municipal Development&#13;
Agreement (MDA), a binding covenant which - in addition to describing the&#13;
municipality's priorities - would also contain the central government's proposed&#13;
assistance plan to the municipality, be it through the MDDP itself or through other&#13;
central resources and programs.&#13;
(c)  Once signed, the MDA would then be implemented as follows: (i) corrective&#13;
institutional measures under the financial/administrative rehabilitation plan would be&#13;
carried out jointly by the municipality and the PCU, and (ii) priority physical&#13;
investment(s) would be realized - at least partially - through the MDF, with a US$&#13;
500,000 ceiling for each investment project (see Attachment C). Any investment&#13;
benefiting from MDF funding, which would be always contingent upon the&#13;
unanimous approval by the Fund's seven-member Board, would then be managed by&#13;
Contract Management Consultants identified and hired by the MDF itself.&#13;
5.    The potential impact on local government reform that could derive from the entire&#13;
designcould be sumarized as follows:&#13;
(a)  the PCU will ensure the overall consistency between project objectives and&#13;
Government policy priorities. From an operational point of view, the PCU will&#13;
provide the required technical assistance to the participating municipalities and&#13;
central government agencies during the initial stage of the decentrtalization, and&#13;
(b)  the MDF will focus on investment financing through a transparent process. It will&#13;
provide the Government with the opportunity to test the effectiveness of a modern&#13;
mechanism to generate and support investment at the local level.&#13;
&#13;

6.    In addition to objective criteria and procedural transparency, the Government's desire to&#13;
ensure a homogenous geographic distribution of the Project's benefits was assigned high priority&#13;
during the selection of municipalities.&#13;

PROCUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
A.    Procurement Arrangements&#13;
1.    The procurement activities under this Project fall under two broad categories: (i) a line&#13;
of credit for $16.1 million to Georgian Municipalities through the MDF; and (ii) the Institutional&#13;
component for $4.8 million covering the various studies and consulting services, and small item&#13;
of equipment for PCU and MDF use.&#13;
2.    The municipal investments component (line of credit) would be implemented by the&#13;
MDF which has been created under a Charter by the GoG to channel funds to municipalities for&#13;
rehabilitating municipal infrastructure, including health and education facilities, roads, etc. The&#13;
procurement under this component would mainly relate to rehabilitation of small works, supply&#13;
and installation of equipment, and other small equipment and some spare parts. After extensive&#13;
discussions, it has been agreed that the procurement of goods, works, and services for this&#13;
component will be contracted by the MDF to independent contract management consultants&#13;
whose selection will be on competitive basis; the final selection of a CMC will however be&#13;
decided by an evaluation committee consisting of the PCU, MDF, and the concerned&#13;
Municipality representative. The CMCs will act as procurement consultants and will handle all&#13;
the phases of entire procurement process which will include advertisement, preparation of&#13;
bidding documents, assistance to MDF in bid evaluation, and contract administration. The&#13;
contracts with the contractors and suppliers will however be signed by the municipality officials&#13;
and countersigned by MDF executive director.&#13;
3.    To ensure compliance with Bank's Procurement Guidelines and procedures, including&#13;
standard bidding documentation, it has been agreed to provide procurement related TA to MDF&#13;
where bulk of the procurement will take place. The procurement specialist will be selected on&#13;
competitive basis and the main selection criteria will be the actual experience in Bank-financed&#13;
procurement. A foreign procurement expert will provide guidance to MDF and PCU on&#13;
procurement issues during the initial phase of project implementation, assist in the procurement&#13;
of equipment and consultant services for the PCU and MDF; and will help monitor the&#13;
performance of various CMCs contracted by the MDF for municipal investment project&#13;
procurement.&#13;
4.    The Institutional component consist of various studies, consulting services, and&#13;
procurement of information systems, including hardware and some office equipment. The PCU&#13;
and the MDF will each be responsible for their respective procurement activities. However, they&#13;
will be assisted by the MDF Procurement specialist in the tendering procedures and evaluation&#13;
process.&#13;
5.    The procedures to be followed by the municipality and MDF for procurement of goods,&#13;
civil works and consultant services, including the selection of contract management consultants,&#13;
for the municipal investments, and by the PCU for the institutional components, have been&#13;
incorporated into an Operational Manual which will serve as the operating guidelines to all the&#13;
entities involved in the Credit-financed procurement.&#13;
6.    These procedures are based on Bank Procurement and Consultant Guidelines and require&#13;
the use of Bank's standard bidding documents, evaluation reports, and contract formats for&#13;
goods, works, and consultant services. The Operational Manual is an essential tool for project&#13;
transparent and efficient implementation.&#13;

BANK EXPERIENCE IN MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.    The proposed project will benefit from the many lessons learned over more than a decade of&#13;
Bank experience in municipal development, worldwide. From the earliest Bank-financed municipal&#13;
development projects, the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) found that a strong&#13;
commitment from the central government to the principles of financially sound municipal&#13;
development, and to ongoing reforms, is essential for project success. Supervision, intensive during&#13;
project start-up, and consistent throughout project implementation was also found to increase the&#13;
likelihood of success.&#13;
2.     From the Brazil: Parana Market Towns Project (Ln 2343-BR), OED identified several key&#13;
factors contributing to project success, including:&#13;
(a) Local government support for the project's local level operations&#13;
(b)  Small subprojects of relatively simple design, for which municipalities themselves,&#13;
through community participation, had expressed a desire.&#13;
(c)  A competent, motivated team in charge of project management at the local level.&#13;
(d) Risk management by simultaneous initiation of subprojects in a number of towns, thus&#13;
reducing the average risks of delayed project execution as well as providing additional&#13;
political support.&#13;
3.     The ongoing Brazil Municipal Development Project in Parana and Rio Grande do Sul States&#13;
(Ln 3100-BR and Ln 3129-BR, respectively) have shown that eligibility criteria (such as the&#13;
preparation of detailed financial and institutional development plan ) for participation in municipal&#13;
development program should be clear and not excessively rigid. Clear and flexible eligibility&#13;
criteria foster increased participation and, at the same time, prevent delays in projects start-up and&#13;
disbursements&#13;
4.    In addition to the lessons learned from completed Bank projects in municipal development,&#13;
several Bank reviews provide lessons from both completed and ongoing projects germane to the&#13;
proposed project An Infrastructure and Urban Development Department (INURD) review of Bank&#13;
lending for municipal finance operations emphasizes that the primary objective of municipal&#13;
finance should not be simply the increased extraction of tax revenues for municipal use. Instead,&#13;
municipal finance operations must be designed as part of a broader effort to increase the&#13;
accountability of the public sector, through decentralization of control to the local level, and&#13;
through the creation of means and incentives that both allow and encourage local governments to&#13;
respond to local priorities. Thus, successful municipal finance reform must start, not with increasing&#13;
municipal revenues, but with improving the effectiveness and efficiency of municipal service&#13;
delivery.&#13;
5.    In conjunction with this objective, a Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional study (&#13;
Decentralization and Reform of the State - EMENA, The World Bank, September 1992) identified&#13;
direct user charges and betterment taxes as the preferred sources of municipal services, as these&#13;
confront final beneficiaries directly with the costs of municipal services, as well as promoting&#13;
accountability in resource allocation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 2&#13;
6. The INURD and EMENA reviews recommend that:&#13;
(a) The primary interlocutors for municipal finance reformn operations be at the national level,&#13;
as the impact and sustainability of any local level reform depend on the incentives&#13;
provided by the national government to the municipal governments;&#13;
(b) Technical assistance for municipal finance projects be explicitly action-oriented. In the&#13;
past, technical assistance often served as a substitute for reform; policy confrontations&#13;
were avoided by defining the policy context of projects solely in terms of abstract studies;&#13;
and&#13;
(c) a strong central agency in charge of the decentralization process has been key to the&#13;
success of past reforms.&#13;
7.     The Bank experience shows that in the context of municipal finance reform, the Bank&#13;
strives to foster accountability and transparency, to encourage the clear identification of&#13;
responsibilities at each level of government, and to confront consumers with the real costs of the&#13;
services they enjoy. All such actions usually have clear short-term political costs and only longer-&#13;
term, intangible benefits. Because of the resulting political difficulties inherent in&#13;
municipal finance reform, the Bank must:&#13;
(a) Plan for long term, multiple project investments and sustained policy dialogue with the&#13;
central government;&#13;
(b) Concentrate its resources on countries where institutional development and&#13;
decentralization are already underway; and&#13;
(c) Devote more staff resources to municipal development operations than it has in the past.&#13;
8.     Finally, a review of Bank experience in the provision of technical assistance makes the&#13;
following recommendations:&#13;
(a) Support upstream institutional development work in selected municipalities or regions;&#13;
(b) Assess the absorptive capacity of entities involved in institutional development to&#13;
minimize the risk of over-ambitious project design;&#13;
(c) Promote multiple approaches to, and instruments for, the support of complex institutional&#13;
development reforms; and&#13;
(d) Undertake periodic institutional assessments to examine the functions, strengths, and&#13;
weaknesses of, and linkages among, relevant institutions, as well as their legal and&#13;
regulatory framework as well as their performance incentives.&#13;
The design of the MDDP project is trying to integrate all relevant lessons learned by the Bank in the&#13;
municipal sector over the last ten year.&#13;

B.    Role of the World Bank During Supervision&#13;
2.    The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters&#13;
and the Resident Mission in Georgia.&#13;
3.    Recognizing that the proposed Project would be only the second Bank Project in the&#13;
municipal sector in Georgia involving construction of civil works and installation of mechanical&#13;
and electrical equipment, and the first in most of the secondary cities, it is anticipated that it&#13;
would require significant supervision. The supervision would concentrate on the first two years&#13;
when considerable input would be required for the engineering design and the procurement. In&#13;
addition, supervision by technical specialists would be required for the respective project&#13;
components, as described in the following sections. Savings would be realized by utilizing staff&#13;
from the Bank resident mission for project supervision. During the first year of implementation,&#13;
a project launch workshop would be organized to provide basic training for the staff of the&#13;
implementing agencies in procurement, disbursement, accounting and auditing.&#13;
4.    It is anticipated that about 26 staff-weeks of effort for the first year and an average of&#13;
about 18 staff-weeks thereafter would be required for supervision. Following the start-up&#13;
mission and the project launch workshop, supervision requirements in the first two years would&#13;
include two supervision missions per year to coincide with the production of the progress reports&#13;
by the respective implementing agencies. In later years, one supervision mission would be&#13;
conducted each year. The final supervision mission would be to prepare the Project Completion&#13;
Report.&#13;
5.    A mid-term review would be conducted to evaluate project progress in general (in terms&#13;
of procurement, disbursements, status of construction works and other implementation aspects)&#13;
and to assess the status of agreed policy and institutional reforms.&#13;
&#13;

6.     The supervision plan below supplements the regular review requirements for&#13;
procurement actions, advisory services, and general administration. It is important to note that&#13;
this is the Bank's second investment project in the municipal sector, thus there exists some&#13;
limited local implementation experience. However, supervision will include technical assistance&#13;
experts from the Bank.&#13;

ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
Methodology&#13;
As identified in the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) currently under preparation,&#13;
the major environmental problems in Georgia revolve around two major developments: (i) the&#13;
degradation of natural resources; and (ii) the degradation of the urban environment. An underlying&#13;
problem/cause of Georgia's environmental troubles is the economic transition, which limits the&#13;
funding available and continues to exert mounting pressure on scarce natural resources resulting from&#13;
the inability of the urban areas to meet the physical and social needs. As a result, the cities face the&#13;
most serious urban environmental problems and require the most urgent attention. In addition, the low&#13;
quality of public services, principally in infrastructure maintenance, housing, and sanitation, constitute&#13;
the major areas of urban environmental concern in Georgia. No resettlement will be considered.&#13;
The impact of these environmental problems on health has not been recently assessed, but it is&#13;
clear that inadequate sanitation facilities contribute significantly to the prevalence of infectious&#13;
diseases. Poor provision of infrastructure is particularly hindering economic activities. These factors&#13;
particularly affect the urban poor and threaten to undermine the very foundations of the productive and&#13;
service economies of the country.&#13;
In order to maximize the impact of the whole project on the urban environment, the project&#13;
proposes a simplfied methodology for assessing the environmental impact of the subprojects financed&#13;
by the MDF. The standardized environmental impact assessment for every subproject will be included&#13;
in the Manual of Procedures. This methodology will be used by the beneficiaries in the process of&#13;
identifying subprojects to be financed through the project. The proposed methodology should help the&#13;
beneficiaries in assessing the positive impact and reducing or eliminating the negative impact of each&#13;
subproject on the urban environment.&#13;
The MDF's projects in the areas of sanitation and cleaning of urban drainage, urban renewal,&#13;
road maintenance, garbage collection, school and clinic rehabilitation will lead to significant&#13;
improvements in the urban environment. Particular attention has been given to the need for a fruitful&#13;
cooperation between the MDF and the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
The annual technical audits will also include an environmental component. In addition, for&#13;
the mid-term review, the PCU will commission an assessment of the environmental impact of the&#13;
subprojects carried out during the first half of the project. This review will examine all major&#13;
environmental issues to determine their impact and make recommendations on how to mitigate any&#13;
adverse impacts in the future.&#13;

2.3   PCU's (Project Coordination Unit), Role, Functions and Responsibilities&#13;
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU), will be responsible for the implementation of MDDP's&#13;
institutional development component. PCU is to be established through a draft charter attached to the&#13;
Presidential Decree. The PCU will work with MDF to accomplish the project's development objectives. The&#13;
Operational Manual will elaborate the role, responsibilities, and structure of the Unit in accordance with the&#13;
guidelines provided in the PCU Charter. The PCU will function under the supervision of the Head of RPMS&#13;
and will be accountable to the President of Georgia and the Investment Council.&#13;
2.4    CMC's (Contract Management Consultant), Role, Functions and Responsibilities&#13;
The procurement of goods, works and consultant services, needed for the investment component of&#13;
the project will be contracted out by the MDF and PCU to the independent Contract Management Consultants&#13;
(CMC). Once a sub-project is approved by the MDF Board, it will be handed over to CMC. The CMC would&#13;
be selected through a competitive process on the basis of their experience with the Bank financed projects.&#13;
With the assistance of appropriate experts, CMC will be responsible for contract administration on behalf of&#13;
the MDF and the concerned municipalities. The work scope will include: (i) training of municipal, MDF, and&#13;
PCU staff and developing monitoring procedures for the municipalities to be used in managing procurement&#13;
and disbursement; (ii) detailing of procurement plan for the sub-projects; (iii) preparing technical&#13;
specifications of material and equipment required; (iv) preparing specific bid documents based on the Bank&#13;
SBDs; (v) preparing TORs for hiring consultant services, etc. The detailed terms of reference for CMC would&#13;
be provided in the Operational Manual.&#13;
2.5    Municipalities and Sub-Projects Selection Methodology&#13;
The selection of municipalities and sub-projects under the physical investment component&#13;
under MDDP, will be articulated around a Municipal Development Agreement, a binding&#13;
agreement between the central government and municipalities. To initiate, a Municipality will do&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)  submit a request to the Department of Local Government's Project Coordination Unit,&#13;
expressing their interest in Project Approach;&#13;
(b)  complete an audit to determine the financial capacity of the municipality, and&#13;
identifying the administrative, financial and technical action-plan selected for the&#13;
Local Adjustment Plan; and&#13;
(c)  propose a Priority Investment Plan, with the selection of the municipal top-priorities&#13;
and its impact on the local budget.&#13;
To achieve the objectives of the project, for screening the noted below selection criteria was applied:&#13;
(ai)   demonstrated willingness to perform;&#13;
(b)    basic financial and administrative capacity; and&#13;
(c)    above average management capabilities;&#13;
The 10 regional representatives proposed a total of 23 municipalities to RPMS and the Bank for initial&#13;
consideration. Based on the criteria above 11 municipalities were selected to be benefited from the project.&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 4&#13;
The subsequent actions on the part of the selected municipalities, MDF, PCU and CMC would&#13;
include: (i) the municipal audit will be executed by local consultants; (ii) preparation of the financial and&#13;
administrative rehabilitation plan by the respective municipalities; (iii) preparation of priority investment plan&#13;
of the municipalities.&#13;
Thereafter, MDF will carry out: (a) review of the financial situation of the municipalities, (b)&#13;
highlight where the gaps are in terms of maintenance, services, and infrastructure, and (c) justify the&#13;
investments selected under the priority investment plan; and (d) the preparation of municipal contracts for 11&#13;
qualified municipalities. If any of the first 11 selected municipalities fails to qualify, would be replaced by&#13;
any of the 12 reserve municipalities. The standard Forms for: Municipal Audit; Financial and Rehabilitation&#13;
Plan; Priority Investment Project; Municipal Development Agreement; and Sub-Projects Screening&#13;
Methodology are provided in the Operational Manual for guidance.&#13;
2.6    Procurement Guidelines and Procedures&#13;
Procurement Guidelines and Procedures, provide necessary guidelines on the Bank's standard&#13;
procurement procedures as applied to the specific requirements of MDDP. Broadly, it contains the&#13;
procurement arrangements, for the two categories:&#13;

            Georgia - Municipal Development &amp;
            Decentralization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Municipal
            Development and Decentralization Project are to: (1) assist
            the decentralization process at the central and local
            government level; (2) promote an improvement of financial
            and administrative management as well as municipal
            investment program; (3) support urgent local investments;
            and (4) generate employment opportunities. The first of the
            two main components, Institutional Development, has two
            subcomponents: (1) helping to implement a municipal
            development program centered on binding agreements (MDAs)
            between the central government and participating
            municipalities to improve organization and management,
            including public services delivery, strengthen municipal
            planning and programming procedures, human resource
            planning, and physical investment project implementation
            management, and (2) strengthening the central
            government's capacity to implement effectively the
            planned decentralization program by developing national
            information systems, analyzing policy alternatives,
            evaluating the impact of regional and sector investments on
            municipal finance, establishing a project coordinating unit,
            and supporting the initial investment and operating costs of
            the Municipal Development Fund (MDF). The second component,
            Physical Investments, will finance municipal investments
            listed in the Priority Investment Plan (PIP). Investments
            include construction rehabilitation and maintenance of
            public infrastructure (primary and secondary facilities)
            and services operated by local government, such as roads,
            drainage, lighting, etc.; water supply, sanitation, and
            solid waste management; revenue generating facilities;
            health and school facilities; and rehabilitation of historic properties.
