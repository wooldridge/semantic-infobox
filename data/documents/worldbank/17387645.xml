       This Report was prepared by a team led by David Turnham and comprising Chandra Hardy, Dale&#13;
     Hill, William Jones, Homi Kharas, Gary Kutcher, Per Ljung, Christopher Redfern, Harry Walters, and&#13;
     Arshad Zaman. The Economic Analysis and Projections Department prepared much of the data on&#13;
     which Part I is based, and supplied information and assistance for the whole Report. The team also&#13;
     worked closely with members of the Economics and Research staff and of the Agriculture and Rural&#13;
     Development Department, particularly Jean Baneth, Hans Binswanger, Graham Donaldson, Jack Duloy,&#13;
     Peter Miovic, and Donald Pickering. The authors would like to thank these and many other contributors,&#13;
     reviewers, and production and support staff. The work was carried out under the general direction&#13;
     of Bevan Waide.&#13;
       For the discussion of agricultural development, the team would like to acknowledge the considerable&#13;
     help and assistance provided by the staff of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the&#13;
     International Labour Organisation (ILO). FAQ kindly provided material from their data collection which&#13;
     is used extensively in the text. Neither these organizations nor members of their staffs are responsible&#13;
     for views expressed in the Report.&#13;
       The judgments expressed are those of the World Bank staff and do not necessarily reflect the views&#13;
     of the Board of Directors or the governments they represent.&#13;

Note: Country groups are the same as in Table 2.2. The above table may be interpreted as follows. Losses in national income arise from&#13;
   unfavorable movements in import prices compared with export prices. When these price movements are measured relative to the&#13;
   GDP price index, they can be translated into increases in the price indexes of investment or consumption goods relative to the GDP&#13;
   price index. The distribution of the total shock between these components is influenced by government policies. This information is&#13;
   shown for the major country groups in the upper part of the table: their sum equals external shocks to which adjustment was necessary.&#13;
   Countries responded to these shocks by (1) reducing absorption which was distributed over consumption and investment; (2) borrowing&#13;
   from abroad and, where necessary, (3) slower growth. The relative reliance on these modes of adjustment appears in the lower part&#13;
   of the table.&#13;
   Thus, in the semi-industrial Southeast Asia group, for example, the average annual terms of trade loss in 1975-78 relative to 1970-72&#13;
   was 1.8 percent of average 1970-72 GDP. These fell more on consumption goods (1.4 percent) than on investment goods (0.4 percent).&#13;
   The losses were more than fully accommodated by reduced real domestic expenditure relative to GDP: the net domestic resources&#13;
   thus conserved (3.4 percent of 1970-72 CDI') were attributable to large reductions in the real consumption share (7.9 percent) offsetting&#13;
   a rise in the real investment share (4.5 percent). Real external capital flows accounted for an additional 0.4 percent of 1970-72 GDP.&#13;
   Together these modes of adjustment were sufficient to permit growth. For a more detailed discussion of the methodology, see Hardy&#13;
   and Kharas.&#13;

   real domestic growth and real exchange rate movements.&#13;

World Development Report has been published annually by The World Bank since 1978.&#13;
 Part I of World Development Report 1982 reviews development prospects in the international economy&#13;
and supplements the extensive discussion of adjustment issues in the 1981 Report. It finds that,&#13;
although international prospects have worsened over the past year, during the remainder of the&#13;
decade the middle-income countries should be able to continue narrowing the income gap between&#13;
themselves and the industrial countries. The prospects for many of the low-income countries,&#13;
however, remain a matter of grave concern.&#13;
   Part 11 of the 1982 Report concentrates on agriculture, which remains the chief source of income&#13;
for close to two-thirds of the population in developing countries and for the vast majority of the&#13;
world's poor. Informing the discussion is the experience gained by The World Bank in helping to&#13;
finance some 800 agicultural and rural developmnt projects in more than 70 countresexperience&#13;
supported by its broad, intensive programs of economic, scientific, and social research.&#13;
   Numerous tables and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the main body of the Report;&#13;
case studies are interspersed to provide analyses directly related to the substance of the text. The&#13;
final portion of the Report comprises "World Development Indicators," 25 two-page tables containing&#13;
economic and social profiles of more than 120 countries.&#13;

            This fifth World Development Report is
            published at a time when the world economy is beset by
            severe problems. The report reviews development prospects in
            the international economy and supplements the extensive
            discussion of adjustment issues. It finds that, although
            international prospects have worsened over the past year,
            during the remainder of the decade the middle-income
            countries should be able to continue narrowing the income
            gap between themselves and the industrial countries. The
            prospects for many of the low-income countries, however,
            remain a matter of grave concern. The report concentrates on
            agriculture, which remains the chief source of income for
            close to two-thirds of the population in developing
            countries and for the vast majority of the world's
            poor. Informing the discussion is the experience gained by
            the World Bank in helping to finance some 800 agricultural
            and rural development projects in more than 70 countries -
            experience supported by its broad, intensive programs of
            economic, scientific, and social research. Numerous tables
            and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the main body of
            the report; case studies are interspersed to provide
            analyses directly related to the substance of the text. The
            final portion of the report comprises world development
            indicators, 25 two-page tables containing economic and
            social profiles of more than 120 countries.
