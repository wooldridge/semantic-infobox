RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATUTORY COMMITTEE&#13;
TO:    The President, International Development Association&#13;
Recommendation of the nominee selected by Republic of Niger as a member of the Committee&#13;
under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement on the proposed Credit (Public&#13;
Investment Reforms Support Development Policy Financing) to the Republic of Niger&#13;
The undersigned member of the Committee constituted under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles&#13;
of Agreement of the International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits this&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association grant to the Republic&#13;
of Niger a credit in an amount equivalent to EUR 71,400,000. This operation has three development&#13;
objectives: (i) to improve the quality, reliability and accountability of the country's PFM and PIM systems;&#13;
(ii) to establish the policy and regulatory framework necessary for a well-functioning public irrigation sector,&#13;
including a model for the multipurpose operation of the Kandadji Dam; and (iii) to facilitate the reform of the&#13;
electricity sector.&#13;
1.     The member of the Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such credit,&#13;
and of the purpose(s) to which the proceeds of the credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The member of the Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the&#13;
proceeds of such credit are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article&#13;
I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Republic of Niger and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of Niger.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the member of the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from&#13;
the Association, and hereby recommends said Program for such assistance.&#13;
