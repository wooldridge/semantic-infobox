Public Toilets in Urban India&#13;
&#13;
Doing Business Differently&#13;
&#13;
Delhi has witnessed a new initiative that involves private entrepreneurs via Build, Operate, and&#13;
Transfer contracts. This field note looks at both the achievements and challenges in the use of these&#13;
contracts for public toilets. It presents some significant lessons for meeting the sanitation needs of the&#13;
city as a whole.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In Delhi, the idea of private sector development of public toilets via Build,&#13;
Operate, and Transfer contracts first emerged in 1998. It offered two benefits:&#13;
private financing of public infrastructure and an incentive for maintenance.&#13;

Box 1: Management Models for Public Toilet Facilities in India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communal toilet facilities fall into two broad categories: community toilets, which are provided to meet the basic needs of&#13;
poor residential areas; and public toilets, which serve mobile populations in public places such as shopping centers, as well&#13;
as bus and train stations. This field note is concerned with the latter. The three most common management models for&#13;
public toilets are shown below, though there are numerous variations on these themes.&#13;
&#13;
Public sector management                 Toilet blocks owned and maintained by municipal agencies. Usually, no charge is&#13;
                                         levied on users. These are becoming rarer as cleanliness and maintenance are&#13;
                                         generally poor, there being no real obligation or incentive for caretakers to maintain&#13;
                                         a good service.&#13;
&#13;
Private leasing                          Toilet blocks built using municipal funds but operated by NGOs, private contractors&#13;
                                         or individuals who are responsible for routine maintenance and charge user fees.&#13;
                                         The municipality may provide water and power supplies free of charge, and/or&#13;
                                         retain responsibility for structural repairs. The nongovernmental organization Sulabh&#13;
                                         International operates a huge number of pay-and-use toilets on this basis, many of&#13;
                                         them in public places but some serving poor residential areas.&#13;
&#13;
Private sector development               Toilet blocks funded, constructed, operated, and maintained by the private sector,&#13;
                                         usually on land provided by the municipality. User fees apply. Under Build, Operate,&#13;
                                         and Transfer contracts, ownership of the premises transfers to the municipality when&#13;
                                         the lease period expires, typically after five or seven years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Following the successful pilot, in 2002 the New Delhi Municipal Corporation&#13;
issued an open tender for additional 40 sites. The toilets soon proved to be&#13;
profitable but it was advertising, not service delivery, that generated the profits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    the operator to landscape the site,&#13;
                                                                                    making it more attractive both to&#13;
                                                                                    users and advertisers.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    Toilet blocks built under this and&#13;
                                                                                    subsequent contracts had separate&#13;
                                                                                    facilities for men and women (four to&#13;
                                                                                    six compartments for each) plus two&#13;
                                                                                    or three urinals and one or two&#13;

                                                                                    and it was initially possible to find places&#13;
                                                                                    with both a high demand for toilets&#13;
                                                                                    and strong advertising potential. The&#13;
                                                                                    contract period for this first batch was&#13;

Increase the Lease Period&#13;
&#13;
With lease periods fixed at just five or&#13;
seven years, operators have been&#13;
under great pressure to recover their&#13;
investment quickly. Longer lease&#13;
periods would enable them to make&#13;
longer term cost recovery plans with&#13;
proper attention to maintenance of the&#13;
premises. This said, operators may feel&#13;
less pressure to deliver a high quality&#13;
service when they have the reassurance&#13;
of a long contract period--unless of&#13;
course they face the risk of penalties&#13;
for poor performance.&#13;

            Public toilets in urban India : doing
            business differently
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            India faces a daunting urban sanitation
            challenge. Over one-fourth of urban households lack a
            private toilet and there is an evident lack of hygienic
            facilities in public places. Communal facilities may be
            essential not simply as a convenience to travelers and
            shoppers, but as the only possible means of providing access
            to sanitation in crowded slums that are characterized by
            small plots and little open space. Historically,
            municipalities were the main providers of public toilets,
            but these facilities suffered from poor maintenance and
            cleanliness and were largely avoided by the public. Today,
            pay-and-use public toilets have become well established
            across India, most of them funded by municipalities and a
            large proportion operated by nongovernmental organizations
            (NGOs) or small contractors. These are often better
            maintained than standard municipal toilets and are
            consequently more popular with the public. While NGO- and
            Community-Based Organization (CBO)-run toilet complexes are
            now quite common, much less has been done to develop the
            role of the private sector in financing, developing, and
            managing public toilet complexes. Recently, however, the
            city of Delhi has witnessed a new initiative that involves
            private entrepreneurs via Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT)
            contracts. Some 60 public toilet blocks have been developed,
            and a novel feature of the contracts is that the operators
            are allowed to use the external walls of the premises as
            advertising space. This enables them to generate substantial
            revenues. The results of this innovation have been mixed,
            but some contractors have provided an excellent service.
            This field note looks at both the achievements and
            challenges in the use of BOT contracts for public toilets in
            Delhi, and draws out some important lessons for meeting the
            sanitation needs of the city as a whole.
