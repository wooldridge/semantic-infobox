by the World Bank to support poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and&#13;
sustainable access to water and sanitation services.&#13;

Delivering poor-inclusive urban sanitation requires improved service delivery, rather than a focus on infrastructure. This is the&#13;
core finding of a global review by WSP on challenges, trends, and approaches at the global, national and city levels to achieve&#13;
viable poor-inclusive urban sanitation at scale. This paper highlights key observations and lessons from the original study&#13;
report: â&#128;&#156;Delivering Sanitation to the Urban Poor: A Scoping Studyâ&#128;? (2012; unpublished).&#13;
&#13;
This summary was prepared by senior urban water and sanitation specialists Isabel Blackett, Peter Hawkins, and Chris&#13;
Heymans. The authors wish to thank: Jeremy Colin, who prepared the bulk of the research for the scoping study on which this&#13;

and risk adversity may militate against trying new options.&#13;
However, on-site sanitation also has clear limitations. As&#13;
population densities grow and domestic water consump-&#13;
tion increases, managing ever larger volumes of wastewater&#13;
becomes more difficult, and lack of space limits the use of pit&#13;
latrines, particularly those that must be relocated when the&#13;
pit fills. Finding more affordable and poor-inclusive options&#13;
for making the best use of existing and future investments in&#13;
sewerage is a priority, especially for high-density areas.&#13;
&#13;
The evolution of condominial sewerage in Brazil and some&#13;
other parts of Latin America has been documented exten-&#13;
sively, but has not been taken up more widely in other parts&#13;
of the world. This appears to be due to a lack of enabling&#13;
conditions such as technical capacity, financing mecha-&#13;
nisms, and the limited regulatory environment in much of&#13;
Africa and Asia. Another type of low-cost technology, settled&#13;
sewerage, has been installed in Dakar and is currently being&#13;
developed in Lusaka, and may offer a viable alternative for&#13;
users wishing to upgrade to water-seal systems, which often&#13;
end up discharging into street drains or sewers.&#13;
&#13;
These types of systems, and the decentralized wastewater&#13;
collection and treatment systems (DEWATS) championed&#13;
by the German NGO Borda, were conceived as commu-&#13;
nity managed. Experience and recent studies have shown,&#13;
however, that sewerage becomes more sustainable and&#13;
cost-effective when the local public sector or utility accepts&#13;
                                                                               Despite the presence of a basic, though hygienic, communal&#13;
co-management responsibility for monitoring facilities, en-                    toilets located a few meters away, users often value privacy&#13;
suring repairs and maintenance, as well as ongoing techni-                     and convenience over downstream consequences. This la-&#13;

Much has been learned and documented in recent years&#13;
about effective approaches to communal toilet facilities in&#13;
low-income residential areas, some of which show prom-&#13;
ising results. Challenges nevertheless remain, particularly                    Action project in Mukuru, Nairobi, that has been working&#13;
with operation, maintenance, and financial viability. Other                    with the community and schools to ensure access to at least&#13;
open questions include whether community toilets can, on                       one hygienic, usable toilet per four households, with on-&#13;
their own, fully address the sanitation needs of slums and                     site handwashing facilities (Peal and Evans 2011). If space&#13;

can be secured, especially for women and girls.                                able, shared toilets reserved for the use of small, self-selected&#13;

     The central recommendation arising from this review is                 businesses, but may also be provided by a utility&#13;
     that any effective response to the urban sanitation challenge          company.&#13;
     should view it primarily in terms of improving service deliv-        â&#128;¢ Public services include fecal sludge treatment, op-&#13;
     ery. The evidence presented here shows that investments in             eration and maintenance of sewerage and drainage&#13;
     urban sanitation infrastructure can be more effective if they          systems, and solid waste management. They are&#13;
     are planned and managed as part of a service delivery chain,           delivered downstream of users, producing mainly&#13;
     supported by enabling policies. This view of sanitation as a           public goods, and as such it may not be possible to&#13;
     service, rather than as infrastructure means that:                     finance them entirely by direct user fees. They are&#13;
                                                                            usually delivered by local authorities or utility com-&#13;

          that will ensure the safe capture, storage, transport, and        user fees, levies, or local taxes, but rarely can the full&#13;
          treatment of excreta in a managed and coordinated                 capital costs be directly recovered from users.&#13;
          wayâ&#128;&#148;not just investments in hardware.                           â&#128;¢ Infrastructure development may require recourse to&#13;
        â&#128;¢ The focus should be on outcomes rather than inputs,               higher-level (national, state, regional or provincial)&#13;

          se is the objective of the service delivery chain.&#13;

     The analysis makes a case for services being poor-inclusive,      To be effective, these services require an enabling environ-&#13;
     but also citywide, because in the crowded urban environ-          ment that provides policy guidance, rules, and incentives&#13;

     Although this overview of urban sanitation has shown that            Massive investments in infrastructure to address urban&#13;
     the current situation is far from ideal, and that widespread         sanitation in developing countries have often resulted in&#13;
     improvements will not occur at the present rate of prog-             patchy and unreliable coverage, mostly for richer users, and&#13;
     ress, it also identifies initiatives that have potential for wider   frequently leaving poorer communities to fend for them-&#13;

     proved sanitation to the developing worldâ&#128;&#153;s burgeoning cit-          lic health, economic, social, and environmental benefits to&#13;
     ies, and some key technical issues remain to be resolved, but        urban dwellers, it must reach all communities, as poor ex-&#13;
     much can be achieved by applying what is already known               creta management in one area results in contamination that&#13;

            Poor-inclusive urban sanitation : an overview
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most of the world's population now
            lives in urban areas, and in developing regions the
            proportion living in cities and towns has risen from 35
            percent in 1990 to 45 percent in 2010, from 1.4 billion to
            2.5 billion people (Jacobsen et al. 2012). A 2008 World Bank
            analysis estimated that a third of people living on less
            than US$2 per day reside in urban areas, and United Nation
            or UN-habitat estimates that just under 40 percent of urban
            dwellers live in slums, a number that is growing by more
            than 20 million per year (Baker 2008). These disparities
            highlight a pressing need to address the urban sanitation
            challenge comprehensively, with emphasis on including slum
            dwellers and poor communities that have typically been
            neglected. Without concerted intervention, the prospects of
            cholera, diarrhea, and worm infections will increase,
            jeopardizing education, productivity, and the quality of
            life for all urban dwellers. Although this overview of urban
            sanitation has shown that the current situation is far from
            ideal, and that widespread improvements will not occur at
            the present rate of progress, it also identifies initiatives
            that have potential for wider replication. There is no
            'silver bullet' that will deliver improved
            sanitation to the developing world's burgeoning cities,
            and some key technical issues remain to be resolved, but
            much can be achieved by applying what is already known and
            proven in practice.
