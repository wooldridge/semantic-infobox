THE PREVALENCE OF CALORIE DEFICIENT&#13;
DIETS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
This paper reports further research on the measurement&#13;
of the extent of malnutrition in developing countries. Like in&#13;
the earlier publication, Malnutrition and Poverty, Magnitude and&#13;
Remedies by S. Reutlinger and M. Selowsky, World Bank Occasional&#13;
Paper No. 23, the authors utilized readily available per capita&#13;
calorie consumption and income distribution data to deduce per-&#13;
sonal calorie distributions for selected countries. The major&#13;
new feature of the estimates is that inter-personal variations&#13;
of calorie intakes and requirements within each income group are&#13;
taken into account in a probabilistic way to predict the number&#13;
of people with calorie deficient diets.&#13;
The paper, particularly the projections, have provided&#13;
useful background for the Bank's Policy Paper on Nutrition, Basic&#13;
Needs and Growth and for the Bank's World Development Report III.&#13;

THE PREVALENCE OF CALORIE DEFICIENT&#13;
DIETS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
I. Introduction and Summary&#13;
Nutritional well-being has become a major concern in recent years,&#13;
particularly in the context of general food and basic needs policies.&#13;
Obviously, the design of policies and monitoring their effectiveness in&#13;
terms of nutrition subsumes that it is possible to quantify nutritional well&#13;
being of the population. Several attempts at quantification of the nutri-&#13;
tional status of the population in developing countries have been made in&#13;
recent years, but further improvements in the methodology of measurement as&#13;
well as the essential data for deriving appropriate estimates are needed.&#13;
Following up on earlier work by one of the authors (Reutlinger&#13;
and Selowsky, 1976), one objective in this paper is to derive estimates of&#13;
the extent of malnutrition as measured by the prevalence of calorie deficient&#13;
diets on the basis of readily available data for a large number of countries.&#13;
In the process, we introduce a number of changes in the methodology of&#13;
measurement. The new method seems to us conceptually more correct and, as&#13;
importantly, yields estimates which are more robust to slight or even large&#13;
errors in the data and parameters.&#13;
A second objective is to analyze the likely changes in the&#13;
prevalence of calorie deficient diets in selected countries under a variety&#13;
of development policy scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In summary, our conclusions are as follows:&#13;
(a) Any estimate of the prevalence of calorie deficient diets&#13;
presupposes judgments about what constitutes a calorie adequate&#13;
diet.   Notwithstanding our understanding that any judgment of&#13;
the kind is to a degree subjective, we have based our calculations&#13;
on the calorie requirement levels recommended by the FAO/WHO expert&#13;
committee. Two basic objections have been voiced in recent years&#13;
to those recommendations: that people adjust to lower levels of&#13;
intakes and that people whose income is adequate to increase their&#13;
calorie intakes to the FAO recommended levels choose not to do so.&#13;
Both these objections seem to us misplaced. They say nothing&#13;
about the cost and the desirability of the adjustment process.&#13;
The revealed behavior implicit in household's decisions merely&#13;
shows us that people have many unmet needs and preferences. It&#13;
tells us no more about the adequacy of the diets of the decision&#13;
makers and their children than the persistent use of cigarettes&#13;
by millions of smokers tells us that     smoking is a healthy&#13;
pursuit.&#13;
(b) At present, 65% of the population in the 40 countries reviewed,or&#13;
approximately 700 million people consume less than the&#13;
amount of calories recommended by FAO; 50% or approximately&#13;
500 million people consume less than 90% of the recommended level&#13;
of requirements. The implied calorie gap is about 15% of current&#13;
calorie availability in the countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(c) Estimates of the prevalence of calorie deficient diets do not&#13;
change appreciably when variability among individuals in both&#13;
calorie intakes and requirements is taken into account. Varying&#13;
the calorie income elasticity, holding income distribution and&#13;
average calorie availability constant, has only a modest effect&#13;
on the estimates of calorie deficient diets.&#13;
(d) Given historic rates of income growth, constant income distribu-&#13;
tion and a 1 percent annual rise of food, we project a substantial&#13;
reduction in the share of the undernourished population, but a&#13;
slight increase of the number of people with calorie deficient&#13;
diets in 1990. Annual growth rates of calorie availability under&#13;
these conditions range from 2.7 to 4.3 %.&#13;
(e) A more optimistic assumption of higher income growth and no price&#13;
changes will reduce the number of people with calorie deficient&#13;
diets to 80% of the number in 1973 with supply growing between&#13;
3.2 and 4.8% annually.&#13;
(f) For a few countries, however, historical income growth rates are&#13;
projected to bring about a marked decline of calorie deficient&#13;
diets within the period under consideration. When average calorie&#13;
availability exceeds average calorie requirements by about 20%,&#13;
the share of the calorie deficient population tends to drop to&#13;
very low levels.&#13;
(g) Our prognosis suggests that the normal course of development,&#13;
even with a vigorous expansion in food production, is not likely&#13;
to solve the nutrition problem. In addition, special attention&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
will be required to measures which improve the income distribution&#13;
or at least avoid the income distribution from becoming more&#13;
unequal and to interventions in food markets designed to provide&#13;
for the nutritional needs of the target population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. The Prevalence of Calorie Deficient Diets&#13;
by Alternative Methods of Measurement&#13;
Several recent studies have attempted to assess the seriousness&#13;
of malnutrition by measuring the extent to which diets of large population&#13;
1/&#13;
groupings are deficient in calories.    The main advantages of using these&#13;
calorie deficiency indicators are that on a national scale food consumption&#13;
data are easier to come by than nutritional health data and that calorie&#13;
deficiency data immediately suggest kinds and magnitudes of interventions&#13;
which are needed to overcome such deficiancies.&#13;
While it would be useful to be able to measure the prevalence and&#13;
extent of calorie deficient diets, it must be noted that it is by no means&#13;
clear that it is possible to do this in an unambiguous way. In this respect,&#13;
the identification of the nutrition problem is not much different than the&#13;
identification of, say, the education or housing problem. It is, of course,&#13;
possible to define a minimum calorie energy level fDr the growth and survival&#13;
of human beings, whereas it is virtually impossible to define a&#13;
minimum level of education or housing in the same way. But, any determination&#13;
of desired levels of calorie intakes involve judgments about private and&#13;
social welfare objectives, not much different than those underlying recommenda-&#13;
tions for education and housing.&#13;
1/ Except for isolated cases, calorie sufficient diets have been observed&#13;
generally to supply also adequate levels of essential nutrients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Historically, any assessment of the prevalence of calorie deficient&#13;
diets, the food problem par excellence, relies in one way or another on&#13;
nutrition experts' consensuses about what constitutes an adequate level of&#13;
calorie intake of the average population. The present assessment is no&#13;
exception. But this should not be taken as an endorsement of the particular&#13;
energy requirement levels adopted, nor that it is indeed possible to calculate&#13;
even conceptually any unique requirement level without reference to clearly&#13;
stated private and social welfare objectives. At best, nutrition experts can&#13;
make objective determinations of energy intakes required by an average person&#13;
of a given age and sex to maintain his body weight and to sustain a particular&#13;
expenditure of energy for his daily activities, and in the case of children,&#13;
energy required for growth. In order to recommend adequate calorie intake&#13;
levels, nutrition experts have to make subjective judgments about what consti-&#13;
tutes an adequate body weight, activity level and in the case of children,&#13;
adequate growth. Recommendations of nutrition expert committees convened&#13;
under the auspices of FAO and WHO must similarly be regarded as reflecting&#13;
subjective judgments. With all those reservations clearly in mind, we&#13;
nevertheless believe that the FAO/WHO recommended calorie requirement&#13;
figures ought to be used for approximating orders of magnitudes of the&#13;
calorie deficiency in large populations, while further clarification of the&#13;
requirements concept is elsewhere pursued.&#13;
Ideally, a determination of the prevalence of calorie deficient&#13;
diets should be made on the basis of data describing individuals' calorie&#13;
intakes and requirements. In reality such data are not available nor are&#13;
they ever likely to become available any time soon for sizeable populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
At present, the only data available in most instances are country average&#13;
calorie intakes and country average calorie requirements. A very crude way&#13;
of measuring the prevalence of calorie deficient diets, therefore, is to&#13;
construct an index, CR, which shows the extent to which the per capita&#13;
calorie content of national food consumption meets per capita calorie&#13;
requirements. Without knowledge about the distribution of calories consumed&#13;
in the population, such estimates tell us very little abut the prevalence of&#13;
calorie deficient diets, and even ranking of countries is only meaningful if&#13;
we could assume that the distribution of calories is the same for all countries.&#13;
Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976) refined the measurement of the&#13;
prevalence and magnitude of calorie deficient diets by estimating the personal&#13;
distribution of calorie consumption on the basis of total calories consumed by&#13;
the population, income distribution data and extraneous information about the&#13;
relationship between income and food consumption. Specifically, they estimated&#13;
per capita calorie intake by each income group (C.) with the equations:&#13;
(1)                        Ci      a + binX&#13;
(2)                         b  =ER&#13;
(3)                         a  =   C-bXWnnXi&#13;
where  X   is the per capita income of the   i    income group,   c  is the&#13;
income elasticity at the country's level of per capita caloric requirements,&#13;
R is the country's average level of calorie requirements, C is the country's&#13;
per capita calorie intake and  Wi   is the share of the population in the&#13;
i    income group.  The average calorie deficit in the   i    income group,&#13;
Di, is defined as  R - Ci, when    R &gt; Ci.   With this method it is possible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to construct an index, CDP, which measures the share of the population whose&#13;
average calorie intake is below average requirements and another index, CD,&#13;
which reflects both the prevalence and the magnitude of calorie deficiency&#13;
in the population.&#13;
One possible criticism of the above method is that the calorie&#13;
requirement level is assumed to be constant for all income groups. In&#13;
particular, McCarthy, et al. (1978) presume that requirements are positively&#13;
correlated with income and show that a plausible positive correlation implies&#13;
a slightly lower estimate of the prevalence of calorie deficient diets.&#13;
Per capita calorie requirements of low income groups may be less&#13;
than average because: (a) their body weights are usually lower as a con-&#13;
sequence of undernutrition during childhood and therefore they require less&#13;
for maintenance, (b) they have less opportunity for physical activity&#13;
(insufficient demand for their labor), and (c) they have a higher ratio of&#13;
children to adults. In turn, it is suggested that calorie requirements of&#13;
low income groups may be higher than average, because (a) they engage in&#13;
occupations which require more physical exertion,(b) their household chores&#13;
are more labor intensive,(c) they incur more pregnancies and do more breast&#13;
feeding,(d) the ratio of young and middle aged to old adults is higher, (e)&#13;
they are subjected to more infectious diseases and parasites which impair&#13;
calorie absorption, and (f) their productivity is depressed by insufficient&#13;
energy due to undernutrition.&#13;
In view of the multitude and complexity of factors involved in&#13;
determintng the relationship between income and calorie requirements, we do&#13;
not attempt to deal with this question here. But, since any estimates of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
the prevalence of-calorie deficiency at present and in the future are likely&#13;
to be made on the basis of calorie intake levels for different Income groups,&#13;
it is obviously an important question which should be addressed jointly by&#13;
nutrition experts and anyone desirous of using calorie requirements data&#13;
in the context of the kinds of calculations attempted in this paper.&#13;
Another shortcoming of the above indices is that no account has been&#13;
taken of variations in intakes and requirements among individuals in each&#13;
subgroup.   To the extent that,for a variety of reasons, individuals in each&#13;
subgroups of the population have different intakes and requirements (and&#13;
there is ample evidence that this is indeed the case), and to the extent that&#13;
deviations from average intakes and requirements are not perfectly correlated,&#13;
some individuals in a group which on average is calorie deficient would have&#13;
calorie sufficient diets and, similarly, some individuals in a group which on&#13;
average is calorie sufficient would have calorie deficient diets.(Srinivasan,1979)&#13;
The new indices of calorie deficiency, (CD)* and (CDP)* presented&#13;
in this paper, take account of variations in calorie intakes and requirements&#13;
among individuals. Specifically, it has been assumed that the distribution&#13;
of calorie intakes and requirements within each income group are distributed&#13;
normally with means  Ci  and  R and standard deviations    aci  and  0R&#13;
Hence, for each individual in the   ith  income group, the calorie deficit is&#13;
also distributed normally, with mean  Di = R - Ci   and standard deviation&#13;
(1)             a    =     2   +  aR -   2p aCi R&#13;
Di  /      Ci   R         C     &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
where p is the coefficient of correlation between calorie intakes and&#13;
requirements. Distributions for three income groups are illustrated in&#13;
Figure 1. The shaded area represents the probability of consuming less&#13;
calories than required by an individual in the ith income group. It can be&#13;
seen that even if   R - Ci  is an unbiased estimate of   Di, the probability&#13;
that D   0  is sensitive to aDi.    Table 1 summarizes the formulae used for&#13;
calculating CR, CDP, CD, (CDP)* and (CD)*. Estimates of the various indices&#13;
of calorie deficiency for 41 countries are presented in Table 2.&#13;

W For precise definition of variables, see Table 1.&#13;
(CDP)  is the proporticn of the total population belonging tc Income groups which on&#13;
average have a calcrie deficit.&#13;
(CDP)* is the proportion of the total population having calorie deficits based on a&#13;
.p.obabilistic appraisal of individual's intakes in relation tc requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
data in Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976). The income elasticity (at the level&#13;
1/&#13;
of the country's requirements) was assumed to be 0.3 for all countries- For&#13;
estimating the new indices (CD)* and (CDP)* we assumed that the standard&#13;
deviation of calorie intakes is 15% of the mean intake of each income group&#13;
and the standard deviation of requirements is 15% of the country's mean&#13;
requirement level. In order to assess the maximum error from ignoring inter-&#13;
individual variations in calorie intakes and requirements, the (CDP)* and&#13;
(CD)* estimates reported in Table 2 are based cn the assumption that the&#13;
correlation between intakes and requirements is zero. In reality, it is more&#13;
plausible to assume that there is a fairly high correlation between intakes&#13;
and requirements within the same incore group. Therefore, and also because&#13;
the estimates are not seen to be sensitive to the correlation, all (CDP)*&#13;
and (CD)* estimates reported in the remainder of the paper were calculated&#13;
with the assumption that the correlation coefficient of intakes and requirements&#13;
is 0.7.&#13;
The major noteworthy observation   about the data reported in Table&#13;
2 is that the estimated share of the combined population of all the countries&#13;
having calorie deficient diets is not very sensitive to whether or not&#13;
variability in calorie intakes and requirements are taken into account. On&#13;
average, estimates of (CDP)* are slightly lower than of CDP. The expected&#13;
calorie deficit is, however, higher when variations in calorie intakes and&#13;
requirements among individuals are taken into account. This is as expected,&#13;
1/ Analyses of household survey data in several countries have yielded calorie&#13;
income elasticities as high as 0.55 (Knudsen and Scandizzo, 1979). In&#13;
general, however, elasticities higher than 0.3 yield implausibly low and&#13;
high levels of calorie intakes at low and high levels of income, when&#13;
equations (1) through (3) are used to allocate the total known available&#13;
calorie supply ir. most countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
because the total deficit in each group which is on average in deficit remains&#13;
the same by both methods, while CD does not and (CD)* does identify a deficit&#13;
for the groups which on average consume in excess of calorie requirements.&#13;
Next, we may ask how sensitive are national estimates of calorie&#13;
requirements. In recalculating the indices presented in Table 3, the base&#13;
case is calculated on the assumption that the correlation coefficient between&#13;
calorie intakes and requirements is 0.7, the calorie income elasticity is&#13;
0.3 at the level of eagh country's requirements and the level of requirements&#13;
is the one used by FAO. For the case of low income elasticity, we assumed&#13;
that the elasticity is 0.15. For the case of low requirements case we have&#13;
reduced the FAO requirements by 10%.&#13;
Estimates of the prevalence of calorie deficient diets turm out to&#13;
be generally not very sensitive to the calorie income elasticity, whereas, as&#13;
expected, such estimates are sensitive to the assumed level of requirements.&#13;
The expected calorie deficit is more sensitive to both the calorie income&#13;
elasticity and the level of calorie requirements. For those countries in which&#13;
the overall country'S average calorie consumption is below average requirements&#13;
(CR &lt; 1), the lower elasticity of 0.15 increases CDP* as consumption is more&#13;
equally shared, though CD* is reduced.&#13;
1/ The Spearman Ranking Coefficient is 0.95 for CDP with (CDP)* and 0.83&#13;
for CD with (CD)*.&#13;
2/ Similarly, the estimates would be also sensitive to biased estimates of&#13;
country per capita calorie consumption. Clearly, if, for instance, as&#13;
some believe, food availability is underreported, the extent of under-&#13;
nutrition would be significantly less than what is implied by the reported&#13;
national food statistics. On the other hand, if, as others believe, food&#13;
ccnsumption is much less than food availability, as reported, due to&#13;
greater losses and spoilage in the marketing channels, and at the home,&#13;
the prevalence of calorie deficient diets may be higher than the reported&#13;
estimates.&#13;

Another way of judging the robustness of the estimated index for&#13;
the purpose of inter-country comparisons is to observe the degree to which&#13;
different assumptions made in the derivation of the index lead to changes&#13;
in the ranking of countries or to changes in relative orders of magnitudes.&#13;
In this regard, the correlation in coefficients reported in Table 4 clearly&#13;
indicate that the indices are quite robust.&#13;

Our assessment of orders of magnitude of the prevalence and extent&#13;
of calorie deficiency on a national and global scale must be interpreted and&#13;
used very cautiously. The methods used to obtain estimates of the share of&#13;
the population which is undernourished has been seen to be fairly robust&#13;
with respect to calorie-income elasticities and interpersonal variations in&#13;
calorie intakes and requirements. The estimates are, as expected, more&#13;
sensitive to the total calorie availability (or consumption) in each country&#13;
and the level of calorie requirements presumed to be critical for particular&#13;
populations or sub-groups in the population. It has not been our purpose to&#13;
second-guess the quality of reported national food statistics and expert&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
committees' recommendations of calorie requirements and, therefore, a large&#13;
element of uncertainty about the estimated extent of undernutrition remains&#13;
inevitable.  However, we can say that,subject to verification of these data,&#13;
the proportion of the population in the developing countries which is under-&#13;
nourished is high (on the order of 40 to 60% in the mid-60s). The expected&#13;
calorie deficit (CD) provides usually a more sensitive estimate of the&#13;
calorie deficiency problem.   This index reflects not only the number of people&#13;
involved but also the severity of their deficit. Estimates of this index&#13;
clearly show that the total calorie deficit of the deficient diets is&#13;
generally small relative to total calories available and consumed in the&#13;
countries, somewhere in the order of 5 to 15%.&#13;
For the purpose of evaluating the impact of different income&#13;
policies and for projections, the estimates derived on the basis of the&#13;
method used in this study become more sensitive to income elasticities and&#13;
income distributions. Therefore, while detailed studies of food demand are&#13;
not needed for the purpose of assessing the extent of calorie deficient&#13;
diets at a certain point in time, such studies, even if costly, might be&#13;
fully justified for the purpose of projections and evaluation of the cost&#13;
effectiveness of food and income policies. An analysis of food consumption&#13;
survey data from several countries in a similar context to the one used in&#13;
this paper is reported by 0. Knudsen and P. Scandizzo (1978),&#13;
Similarly, the estimates of the number of undernourished should&#13;
not be taken to mean that all are equally undernourished and that there should&#13;
be no priority target groups within this population, particularly if the&#13;
capacity or willingness to do something about the problem is limited. We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 _&#13;
have seen that setting the requirement target lower by only 10% reduces&#13;
substantially the size of the population defined as undernourished and reduces&#13;
even more significantly the overall magnitude of the food deficit. As is well&#13;
known, past efforts at reaching a consensus about what constitutes a correct&#13;
threshold level of calorie requirements for different populations have not been&#13;
very successful. Perhaps it would be easier to reach agreement about the&#13;
marginal value of an additional calorie at different levels of calorie intake.&#13;
If the marginal value decreases sharply, it would certainly suggest that limited&#13;
resources should be applied to the most undernourished first (provided that the&#13;
cost of intervention is not much different).&#13;
Finally, and this should be obvious, it must be noted that estimates&#13;
of the kind we have presented in this paper pertain to population averages.&#13;
They have no predictive value for any sub-group in the population. Some groups&#13;
may be exposed to more or less than average morbidity, or may require or be&#13;
predisposed to more or less than average physical exertion. Also some&#13;
population groups may have a larger than average proportion of children in&#13;
their midst. If the distribution of food within households is not in propor-&#13;
tion to requirements, and particularly if, as there is some evidence, children&#13;
suffer relatively more deprivation, households would need to have higher&#13;
calorie intakes to assure adequate intakes for their children.&#13;

III. Current Prevalence of Calorie Deficient Diets and Projected Change&#13;
in the Normal Course of Development&#13;
In this section we speculate about orders of magnitude of the&#13;
size of the population with calorie deficient diets in the mid-70s and in&#13;
1990. The projections have been carried out for the same selected countries&#13;
for which we had income distribution data in the mid-60s. Throughout, we&#13;
make the assumption that the income distributions remain unchanged. This&#13;
assumption--that incomes of malnourished households will grow as fast as&#13;
average incomes--will lead to an optimistic estimate of the decrease in&#13;
those malnourished. The estimated size of the population with calorie deficits&#13;
in 1972-74 was derived by allocating the known per capita consumption in each&#13;
country among all income groups in accordance with the consumption functions&#13;
and the probabilistic analysis described in the previous section. The 1990&#13;
estimates are based on assumed growth rates in per capita income and changes&#13;
in food prices. These projections, therefore, implicitly assume that total&#13;
food availability in 1990 will be commensurate with population growth and the&#13;
growth in projected per capita demand assumed under the different scenarios.&#13;
Specifically, when food prices are constant, calorie consumption&#13;
of each income group in each country in a future year, CiT , was projected&#13;
as follows:&#13;
T&#13;
(4)                      CiT     Cio + bin (l+g)&#13;
where  T  represents the interval between the initial year and the year for&#13;
which consumption is projected and g is the annual growth rate of per&#13;
capita income. Cio is consumption in the initial year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
When food prices change, the corresponding projection equation&#13;
used was:&#13;
(5)           CiT     Co + b[Qn (l+g)    + Si Qn(l+d)]&#13;
where Si is the budget share allotted to food and d is the annual growth&#13;
rate in the price of a calorie. This projection equation implies a net&#13;
substitution effect of food with non-food expenditures of zero. Clearly,&#13;
the food trice effect is underestimated, particularly for the middle-income&#13;
groups. This assumption again makes the estimates of the decrease in those&#13;
malnourished possibly overly optimistic.&#13;
Estimates of the shares of the population with calorie deficits in&#13;
1972-74 and in 1990 under different assumptions about growth of income and&#13;
food supply and calorie requirement standards in 36 countries are shown in&#13;
1/&#13;
Appendix Tables 1 and 2. A summary by regions is provided in Table 5 below.&#13;
The striking observation about these estimates is that,while the share of&#13;
the calorie deficit population is likely to decline under any explored&#13;
scenario, the number of people having calorie deficient diets is likely to&#13;
change very little in the course of normal development. In fact, under&#13;
the most likely scenario, the historical rate of income growth and a 1 percent&#13;
annual rise in the price of food, there would be a slight but steady increase&#13;
ih the number of people with calorie deficient diets.&#13;
1/ The budget share alloted to food by each income group, Si, was estimated&#13;
with the following equation:&#13;
S1   .82(1 + .037Xi) *35&#13;
where Xi is annual per capita income of the corresponding income group.&#13;
The parameters were derived by fitting the equation to national and&#13;
intra-national data as reported in SARUM 76(1977).&#13;

Our conclusions are straightforward. The prevalence of calorie&#13;
deficient diets is not likely to diminish soon in terms of the number of&#13;
afflicted people in the developing countries. The share of the calorie&#13;
deficient population is likely to decline. Even this modest achievement, if&#13;
it can be called that, can be only sustained if income distributions do not&#13;
become more unequal in the process of development and if annual growth rates&#13;
of the supply of calories will exceed annual population growth rates by&#13;
approximately 1 percent. A more aggressive approach to solving the problem&#13;

of calorie deficient diets will undoubtedly require specific interventions in&#13;
the form of either consumer price subsidies or subsidies to food production,&#13;
or both. Finally, it should be noted that this prognosis is quite independent&#13;
of the precise definition of what constitutes a calorie adequate diet.&#13;
Obviously, the overall magnitude of the problem and hence also the appropriate&#13;
policy interventions are quite sensitive to what is believed to be the&#13;
particular average calorie requirement level of particular populations. More-&#13;
over, for a few individual countries, our general conclusions do not hold.&#13;
These are the couatries which have had and will continue to have high rates of&#13;
growth in per capita income. In these countries the prevalence of calorie&#13;
deficient diets is going to decline markedly and even disappear in the normal&#13;
course of development within a reasonably short time, provided of course,&#13;
that growth of income among the lower income groups is not any less than the&#13;
national average.&#13;

ANNEX&#13;
Additional Comment on Calorie Requirements and&#13;
the Correlation between Requirement and Intake&#13;
Professor George Beaton of the Department of Nutrition and Food&#13;
Science of the University of Toronto, drew our attention,in a private commu-&#13;
nication,to several important aspects of the evaluation of calorie deficient&#13;
diets which for various reasons we have not fully explored in the text, but&#13;
which we believe deserve further discussion.&#13;
Dr. Beaton notes that the notion of a calorie deficit as defined&#13;
in the text must be interpreted cautiously. He suggests that in a sense:&#13;
"all existing populations (except those in a stage of temporary acute famine&#13;
or other food shortage) are adapted to their food supply. If we say they&#13;
are in deficit, we mean that their adaption to a lower than recommended level&#13;
of intake occurs at an unacceptable social and health cost whether you&#13;
measure these costs as high morbidity and mortality, low socio-economic&#13;
standards, low economic growth rate or other parameters." Dr. Beaton goes&#13;
on to say that the main ways how "deficit" populations adapt is by adjusting&#13;
(a) the growth rate of children and adult size, and (b) physical activity,&#13;
including both occupational (including work in the house/family units) and&#13;
non-occupational activity." The recommended requirements take account of&#13;
adaptation as reflected in adult size, but they presume that the potential&#13;
growth rate of children and the level of physical activity would be the same&#13;
in all population strata, if food were not a constraint. The implication is&#13;
that a hypothetical individual, who now subsists on say, 2000 kcal per day&#13;
would change his lifestyle to one that required 2500 kcal per day.&#13;
As Dr. Beaton points out correctly, one should be careful not to jump to&#13;
the conclusion that this would indeed occur, simply as a consequence of increased&#13;
availability of food. He states correctly:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
"'In situations commonly encountered in developing countries,&#13;
does the availability and intake of food (energy) limit&#13;
economic productivity or does opportunity for/incentive for&#13;
occupational physical activity limit the need for and con-&#13;
sumption of food?' I do not know the answer to this question.&#13;
I would guess that there is a bit of both in most communities&#13;
and the one or the other might dominate in some communities."&#13;
In conclusion, universal access to food in amounts equal to the&#13;
FAO/WHO recommendations is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient&#13;
condition for a healthy and active population. Increased opportunities&#13;
and incentives for more physical activity may be also necessary.&#13;
(b) Correlation between Calorie Intakes and Requirements&#13;
The calculations of the prevalence and calorie deficient diets&#13;
reported in the text are based on certain assumptions about the correlation&#13;
between individuals' consumption and requirements. Specifically we assumed&#13;
a correlation coefficient of 0.7 for all population strata. However,&#13;
Dr. Beaton suggests that "when there is no constraint on consumption (i.e.,&#13;
the higher income strata), intake and requirements for the individual will&#13;
generally match very closely. That is, at the range of satiation of&#13;
energy needs, the correlation between intake and requirement is very close&#13;
to 1 (assuming that we are talking about "usual intake" and "usual"&#13;
requirement" to overcome the issue of intra individual variation)."&#13;
Dr. Beaton goes on to say that he does not feel "that one should&#13;
expect the correlation to remain high as the mean intake of a group falls&#13;
below the mean requirements of a group" although he does not think "that&#13;
we have data that establish the magnitude of this correlation."&#13;
In this context, it might be interesting to note the order of&#13;
bias introduced by assuming that the correlation is. constant for all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
population strata, as we have done in the calculations presented in the&#13;
text   when, alternatively, the "true" correlation coefficient is 1 for the&#13;
population strata whose intakes are adequate. On average for all countries,&#13;
the effect of the alternative assumption would be to reduce the share of the&#13;
estimated population consuming less than 90% of requirement by about 18% in&#13;
1973 (i.e., the average share would have been .33 instead of .40). The&#13;
possible bias varies a great deal among countries and periods. For instance,&#13;
the share of the population with calorie deficits in India is reduced from&#13;
.53 to .51 in 1973 and from .39 to .23 in 1990 (with low income growth and&#13;
constant food prices) when we assume that the correlation coefficient is 1&#13;
for the higher consumption strata rather than 0.7. Similarly, the estimates&#13;
of the shares in Sri Lanka are reduced from .44 to .28 in 1973 and from .28&#13;
to .24 in 1990.&#13;
In reality, the change in the correlation coefficient is likely to&#13;
be less abrupt among different population strata. However, our sensitivity&#13;
analysis suggests that a more precise evaluation of the correlation between&#13;
calorie intakes and requirements could significantly improve the reliability&#13;
of estimates of the prevalence of calorie deficient diets.&#13;

            This paper reports further research on
            the measurement of the extent of malnutrition in developing
            countries. Like in the earlier publication,
            "Malnutrition and Poverty, Magnitude and Remedies"
            by S. Reutlinger and M. Selowsky, World Bank Occasional
            Paper No. 23, the authors utilized readily available per
            capita calorie consumption and income distribution data to
            deduce personal calorie distributions for selected
            countries. The major new feature of the estimates is that
            inter-personal variations of calorie intakes and
            requirements within each income group are taken into account
            in a probabilistic way to predict the number of people with
            calorie deficient diets.
