                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  1.    Total Sanitation Campaign: Reform Initiative in Rural Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
  The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) marks a major policy shift from a subsidy based&#13;
  supply driven approach to an incentive based demand responsive approach to sanitation&#13;
  in the country. The focus now is on total sanitation at the community level as against&#13;
  some individual sanitary latrines at the household level. The idea is to have fully sanitised&#13;
  villages free from open defecation, dry latrines and manual scavenging, and safe disposal&#13;
  o1~ solid waste and waste water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The strategy is to make the programme community led, people centered and demand&#13;
  re!sponsive with increased emphasis on awareness creation and demand generation for&#13;
  sanitary facilities at the household and community level. Another major area of thrust is&#13;
  clean village environment. The TSC is demand responsive and community-led in the&#13;
  s19nse that local communities have to be mobilised to undertake the responsibility for&#13;
  planning, implementation and operation and maintenance of assets. This people-centered&#13;
  approach of the TSC is aimed not only at creating community ownership of the assets&#13;
  created, but also at promoting behaviour change in people in order to ensure health and&#13;
  hygiene benefits on a sustainable basis.&#13;
&#13;
  TSC envisages closer inter-linkages with Panchayat Raj Institutions in consonance with&#13;
  the spirit of 73rd Amendment to the Constitution and, as far as possible, its implementation&#13;
  is to be integrated with that of the recently launched country-wide community-based rural&#13;
  water supply program known as Swajaldhara.&#13;
&#13;
  The Total Sanitation Campaign thus in brief embodies a shift from a high subsidy to a low&#13;
  subsidy regime, greater community involvement, choice of technology according to&#13;
  customer preferences, emphasis on software activities for capacity building,&#13;
  institutionalization of participative processes and development of back-up services.&#13;
&#13;
  1.1   Reform Agenda of TSC&#13;
&#13;
  The key elements of the reform agenda of TSC are :&#13;
&#13;
        ~     community-based approaches and processes,&#13;
        ~     creation or an enabling environment,&#13;

1.2   Campaign Objectives, Components and Structure&#13;
&#13;
 1.2. 1 Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The main objectives of the TSC, as stated in the RGNDWM guidelines are to:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Bring about an improvement in the general quality oflife in the rural areas.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Accelerate sanitation coverage in rural areas.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Generate felt demand for sanitation facilities through awareness creation and&#13;
            health education.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Cover schools/Anganwadis in rural areas with sanitation facilities andpromote&#13;
            hygiene education and sanitary habits among students.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Encourage cost effective and appropriate technologies in Sanitation.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Eliminate open defecation to minimize risk of contamination of drinking water&#13;
            sources and food&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Conved dry latrines to pour flush latrines, and eliminate manual scavenging&#13;
            practice, wherever in existence in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
 1.2.2 Campaign Components&#13;
&#13;
      a)     Start-up Activities&#13;
      b)     IEC Activities&#13;
      c)     Rural Sanitation Marts and Production Centers&#13;
      d)     Construction of Individual Household Latrines {IHHLs)&#13;
      e)     Construction of Community Sanitary Complexes&#13;
      f)     School Sanitation and Hygiene Education&#13;
      g)     Administrative charges&#13;
&#13;
 1. 2. 3 Campaign Or..qanizational Structure&#13;
&#13;
Planning and implementation of the Total Sanitation Campaign at the District level would&#13;
be carried out by the Zilla Panchayat. In case where Zilla Panchayat is not in existence, a&#13;
District Water and Sanitation Mission would be constituted to implement the project.&#13;
However, both the TSC and Swajaldhara should be implemented by the same agency and&#13;
the line departments have to play a catalytic role in the process.&#13;
&#13;
The TSC would be implemented by the Panchayati Raj Institutions at all levels. They&#13;
would facilitate social mobilization, help maintain the clean environment by way of safe&#13;
disposal of wastes, act as the custodian of the assets such as the Community Sanitary&#13;
Complexes (CSCs), environmental components, drainage etc. constructed under the TSC&#13;
and can also open and operate the Production Centres/Rural Sanitary Marts. However, at&#13;
the village level, representative Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs) would&#13;
be formed, which would be responsible for day-to-day informed decisions regarding the&#13;
planning and implementation of the project.&#13;

                                                                           '!'Â®till Slll!l!f~JIIJÂ®ilSIIItill!l&#13;

&#13;
 NGOs have to be actively involved in IEC (software) activities as well as in hardware&#13;
 activities. They can also open and operate Production Centres and Rural Sanitary Marts&#13;
 and may be engaged to conduct base line surveys and PRAs specifically to determine key&#13;
 behaviours and perceptions regarding sanitation, hygiene, water use, O&amp;M, etc.&#13;
&#13;
 States would have more of an advisory role and ensure co-ordinating, monitoring and&#13;
 evaluation of progress and achievements of TSC. States can take up IEC and HRD&#13;
 activities for the whole state and engage required specialist consultants for which funds&#13;
 may be provided to the states by GOI on a 75:25 sharing pattern. These funds would be&#13;
 outside the TSC funds.&#13;
&#13;
 Proposals received from the districts, through the state channel, will be examined by the&#13;
 NSSC, which will be chaired by the Secretary, Drinking Water Supply Department. The&#13;
 Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission will also have the mandate of arranging for&#13;
 periodic reviews of the states' performance with regard to TSC and evaluating and&#13;
 reviisiting TSC policies and guidelines accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
  1. 3   Current Reporting and Momloring Practices&#13;
&#13;
 Thn GOI has already put in place a reasonably supportive monitoring and evaluation&#13;
 system comprising the following:&#13;
&#13;
         );-   Household Survey Questionnaire and Base-line Survey&#13;
         );-   Project District Sanitation Data Base&#13;
         );-   Monthly and cumulative annual progress reports - both physical and financial&#13;
               to be submitted by each participating state to GOI.&#13;
         );-   Regular field inspections by state and district officials&#13;
         );-   Periodic Reviews by SWSM and RGNDWM&#13;
         );-   Web-based online progress tracking system&#13;
&#13;
 Th1e existing M &amp; E system being followed by GOI basically captures physical and&#13;
 financial progress of the project. In view of the process driven nature of the reform&#13;
 initiative of TSC, there is a felt need to develop an M &amp; E design which could assess&#13;
 qualitative aspects such as generation of demand and creation of an enabling&#13;
 environment. These qualitative dimensions of the programme are expected to result in&#13;
 community's enhanced demand for household and community latrines, promotion of&#13;
 different types of technology for sanitation facilities suited to local needs and conditions,&#13;
 and their sustained maintenance and usage.&#13;
&#13;
 The TSC M&amp;E module design, while building on the existing system already in use at&#13;
 RGNDWM, adds considerable value to the monitoring and evaluation exercise by making&#13;
 it an interactive exercise in continuous learning and action. The TSC module is to be&#13;
 plugged into the M&amp;E system designed for the Swajaldhara program. The integrated&#13;
 delivery of these two programmes in some states will provide a suitable platform for the&#13;
 launching of this plug-in module.&#13;

  1. 5   Overall Framework of Proposed M &amp; E system of TSC&#13;
&#13;
  The TSC module takes into account both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the&#13;
  programme. The quantitative window consists of a set of indicators which contains&#13;
  process-based indicators as well as the performance-based physical and financial&#13;
  progress indicators in the already existing M&amp;E system being followed by the TSC.&#13;
&#13;
  The qualitative window consists of a system of periodic reviews (PR) and a community&#13;
  monitoring and evaluation (CM&amp;E) system. The periodic reviews are proposed to be&#13;
  conducted by RGNDWM and SWSMs at the state and district levels respectively. These&#13;
  reviews are to be carried out by a team of multidisciplinary professionals. The CM&amp;E is to&#13;
  be undertaken by the users themselves primarily for their own purposes at the community&#13;
  level, but it would also inform the project management through the mechanism of inland&#13;
  letters. The performance at various levels in these two sub-components would be given&#13;
  some numeric value, so as to be reflected in the PIC system.&#13;
&#13;
  The Performance Index Card (PIC), which will be generated by the computerized MIS&#13;
  system to be operationalized at all levels, is the integrating mechanism of the system. The&#13;
  PIC is designed to integrate and rate the quantitative and qualitative performance of all&#13;
  stakeholders and functionaries at various levels in a holistic and comprehensive manner.&#13;
  A set of benchmarks derived from both the quantitative and qualitative indicators, and the&#13;

1.6    Implications of a Plug-in Module with Swajaldhara&#13;
&#13;
The integrated delivery of drinking water and sanitation services is fundamental to the&#13;
functionality, usage and sustainability of assets created. Hence, it is important to have a&#13;
single, integrated M&amp;E system to be used by different implementing and facilitating&#13;
agencies/bodies at the various project levels. It is in view of this that the TSC module is&#13;
designed as a plug-in module to Swajaldhara M&amp;E system.&#13;
&#13;
Though to begin with, there would be states and districts where Swajaldhara and TSC&#13;
would be implemented independently of each other. But at the same time, as per the&#13;
current policy intent, both the programmes would have to be managed in an integrated&#13;
manner over a period of time in all the states and districts. The TSC module is designed to&#13;
cater to both these requirements. Moreover, the structure and management costs of&#13;
administering this module would also be not much, as it is assumed that the infrastructure,&#13;
hardware, personnel and other resources would be jointly shared by both Swajaldhara&#13;
and TSC programmes.&#13;

  2.        Quantitative Window&#13;
&#13;
 The quantitative aspects of the campaign i.e. physical and financial progress will be&#13;
 captured through a set of objectively verifiable indicators that include process (P), physical&#13;
 pro~Jress (PP) and financial progress (FP) indicators. The information to be fed into the&#13;
 computer based MIS, would be determined by these indicators only. This information&#13;
 would be obtained through progress formats, which would be filled up by&#13;
 facillitating/implementing agencies in the field. All data entry will be done at the district&#13;
 level and the district programme management team will be responsible for analysis and&#13;
 generation of reports.&#13;
&#13;
  2.1       Key Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Swajaldhara was designed as a modular system to accommodate multiple&#13;
             thematic plug-ins which were envisaged as:&#13;
                o Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC)&#13;
                o Hygiene and Health&#13;
                o Water Quality Monitoring&#13;
                o Water Conservation Measures&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢    TSC represents the first thematic module of the overall Swajaldhara M&amp;E System&#13;
             and has to be similar in its structure and design to the main system.&#13;
&#13;
 2.2        Deviations from Swajaldhara M&amp;E Design&#13;
&#13;
 Certain deviations have been necessitated due to inherent differences in the program&#13;
 structures of both TSC and Swajaldhara programs.&#13;
&#13;
             i.     No baseline data is available either at village or at habitation level, for the&#13;
                    country as a whole. However, provision would be made for entering the&#13;
                    baseline data at the district level,' as and when available.&#13;
             ii.    In Swajaldhara the schemes are designed and formulated at the habitation&#13;
                                                                              /&#13;
&#13;
                    level, whereas in TSC the entire village (covering all habitations of the&#13;
                    village) is the unit for scheme formulation and design.&#13;
             iii.   There are two sources of funds at the district level - one from the State and&#13;
                    the other directly from Gal.&#13;
             iv.    In Swajaldhara the expenses incurred during the month were being&#13;
                    captured under the categories of hardware, software and administrative&#13;
                    expenses, while in TSC, expenses against each of the items are being&#13;
                    captured and subsequently reflected in various reports.&#13;
             v.     Suitable indicators at the village level have been devised so that the&#13;
                    eligibility of an individual/village/scheme for Nirmal Gram Puraskar can be&#13;
                    determined.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        vi.     Data capture during the O&amp;M phase has been limited to information on&#13;
                assets only and does not capture expenses.&#13;
2.3   Scoring Pattern&#13;
There are a total of 27 MIS indicators distributed over three levels of the project- village,&#13;
district and state, on the basis of whichÂ· data would be collected. The maximum score of&#13;
quantitative indicators at the village level is 500. At the district level, the maximum score&#13;
against quantitative performance would be 500 out of which 50 marks would be based on&#13;
district specific indicators, 50 marks as bonus for Nirmal Gram Puraskar and remaining&#13;
400 marks based on quantitative performance at the village level. At the state level, the&#13;
maximum score against quantitative performance would be 500 out of which 100 marks&#13;
would be based on state specific indicators and the remaining 400 marks would be based&#13;
on quantitative performance at the village and district levels including bonus for Nirmal&#13;
Gram Puraskar.&#13;
&#13;
The quantitative scores obtained will then be combined with the qualitative scores which&#13;
will be tabulated together to inform the Performance Index Card system by which each&#13;
project village, district and state can be rated.&#13;
2.4   Supporting technology option&#13;
As the M &amp; E system proposed for TSC is to be used in an integrated manner along with&#13;
the Swajaldhara module, it would be utilizing the existing infrastructure. The computerised&#13;
MIS of the system is web-based, in which both the application and the databases would&#13;
be physically hosted on a server within RGNDWM. The entire data would be maintained&#13;
within the centralized databases but the access to data by the respective states would be&#13;
controlled.&#13;
2.5   Systems Requirements and Specifications (SRS)&#13;
&#13;
Based on the ove~rall project design, a Systems Requirements and Specifications (SRS)&#13;
document would be prepared. The core project database relates to other external&#13;
datasets and users (through input and output formats). It would comprise of the following.&#13;
&#13;
2 5 1 Database Structure&#13;
&#13;
Data for the Computerized MIS can be classified as 'External Data' (available as Census&#13;
and Habitation survey), 'Internal Data' (data related to system used, and support data for&#13;
user lists), and 'Project Data' (data collected at Scheme, District, State and National&#13;
levels). This data will then be processed to deliver the desired reports. The database&#13;
design is characterized by two types of tables, namely (1) Master Table (one time entry)&#13;
which would maintain the external and internal data, and (2) Transaction Table (providing&#13;
for regular updates) to maintain all the project data set.&#13;

It may be noted here that the computerised MIS will automatically generate the RGNDWM&#13;
monthly progress report partly, Performance Index Cards, including Benchmark details,&#13;
and community feedback reports. In addition, the user would also have the freedom to&#13;
query the database directly for any specific information s/he may require during the course&#13;
of project management.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Qualitative Window&#13;
&#13;
The qualitative window has two components of state and district periodic review and the&#13;
community monitoring system.&#13;
&#13;
3.1      Periodic Review&#13;
&#13;
Periodic reviews of the states and districts would be commissioned by RGNDWM and&#13;
SWSM respectively, with the prime objective of assessing the quality of processes and&#13;
outcomes. It is expected that a team of multidisciplinary professionals having a sound&#13;
understanding of sanitation and hygiene issues would be fielded for undertaking these&#13;
periodic reviews. In states and districts where the Swajaldhara and TSC projects are&#13;
being managed jointly at state and district levels, the review teams would look at both&#13;
programmes simultaneously. Therefore, the management structure and the costs involved&#13;
for conducting the Periodic Reviews, will not be duplicated and the exercise would be cost&#13;
effective. However, where the TSC is being managed independently of Swajaldhara, the&#13;
costs will have to be booked under the administrative component of the project.&#13;
&#13;
For review of districts within a state, it would be the responsibility of the concerned SWSM&#13;
to form a multi-disciplinary team of professionals engaged in planning and management of&#13;
Swajaldhara districts as members of the review team. The SWSM would ensure that all&#13;
the project districts are reviewed at least once in a year. Similarly, review of participating&#13;
states would be carried out by RGNDWM at least once in a year in every participating&#13;
state. This again has to be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of professionals,&#13;
selected carefully for their outstanding experience and insight in the sector. The periodic&#13;
review team will also suggest a set of actions, which require immediate attention at the&#13;
project end. The scores achieved in the periodic review of districts by SWSM would be&#13;
entered in the respective District PICs. Similarly, scores achieved in periodic reviews&#13;
commissioned by RGNDWM for States would be entered in the respective State PICs.&#13;
&#13;
3. 1. 1 Outcomes to be reviewed&#13;
&#13;
Periodic review would be undertaken in the two broad categories, namely programme&#13;
qualitative assessment and moving towards Nirmal Gram Puraskar. These would entail&#13;
the following:&#13;

&#13;
 31.2 Review Activities and Methods for Periodic Review Teams at State, District and&#13;
      VIllage Levels&#13;
&#13;
 In order to determine the scores to be earned for each of the above contributing factors in&#13;
 each category, the Periodic Review teams conducting both the State and the District PRs&#13;
 will have to undertake various review activities like perusal of relevant documents,&#13;
 transect walks, observation, focused group discussions and individual interviews,&#13;
 community mapping exercises, visits to relevant institutions, checking data entries and so&#13;
 on.&#13;
&#13;
 3. 1. 3 Linkage with Performance Index Card and Benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
 The scores achieved in the state reviews organized by RGNDWM would be entered in the&#13;
 State PIC. Similarly, the scores achieved in the district reviews organized by SWSM would&#13;
 be entered in the district PIC.&#13;
&#13;
 As evident from the above description, the programme qualitative assessment is being&#13;
 carried out in the four benchmark categories. This is being done to capture the qualitative&#13;
 aspects of the related indicators, the quantitative information about which is already being&#13;
 obtained through the computerised MIS. The numerical value of each benchmark&#13;
 category would be worked out on the basis of actual percentage being achieved against&#13;
 ~~ach benchmark, as per the data available in the computerised MIS. The scores obtained&#13;
 loy states on the benchmark categories will be compared with the determined benchmark&#13;
 values. The final benchmark value will be ascertained by taking average percentage of&#13;
 values scored in respect of benchmark categories through computer based MIS and&#13;
 periodic review.&#13;
&#13;
 3.2   Community Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (C-M&amp;E) System&#13;
&#13;
 The purpose of C-M&amp;E is to institutionalise the process of concurrent learning and action&#13;
 regarding TSC project planning and management at the community level. A participatory&#13;
 community monitoring system would empower the user communities by upgrading their&#13;
 organisational and management skills. This would also generate a wealth of data, which&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Knowledge Links&#13;

                                                                        'l'otal SYiiiJW!!!II:liii!SIIitill!l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
besides being used by the community for their own purposes, would also inform project&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
The C-M&amp;E tools are essentially designed to promote interactive and experiential&#13;
learning. They can also be used both by the literate and illiterate segments of the&#13;
community equally effectively irrespective of their gender and class characteristics.&#13;
However, the community capacity building and initial hand holding by the support agency&#13;
and their community facilitators are of critical importance in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
The community monitoring activities shall be undertaken during all the phases (planning,&#13;
implementation, O&amp;M) to ensure community control over all the key project processes and&#13;
decisions. This would promote transparency in VWSC functioning and ensure greater user&#13;
participation in scheme planning and management.&#13;
&#13;
Community monitoring would involve collection of both qualitative and quantitative data&#13;
and information. Special methods that stimulate group awareness, assessment and action&#13;
would be utilized by communities for monitoring of activities and processes in the project.&#13;
&#13;
The key steps that would be required for institutionalising community-monitoring system&#13;
are:&#13;
&#13;
1.    Formation of a Community Monitoring Group and training them to undertake&#13;
      monitoring activities through use of tools for information collection.&#13;
&#13;
2.    Identification of key issues and concerns amongst communities through a process of&#13;
      consultation with VWSC and users.&#13;
&#13;
3.    Identification of indicators and dedication of the community monitoring group to a&#13;
      small set of monitoring activities.&#13;
&#13;
A community monitoring group of 6-8 persons compnsmg representatives of VWSC,&#13;
village maintenance worker (VMW), Anganwadi worker, an elderly lady, a school going girl&#13;
child and representatives of disadvantaged sections etc. would be constituted for the&#13;
purpose. This group would monitor issues of their concern and submit their assessment&#13;
report to VWSC for action.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢   Inland letters&#13;
&#13;
Communities would be sending information to DWSC/ZP through printed inland letters on&#13;
a bimonthly basis in planning and implementation phase and on a monthly basis in the&#13;
operation and maintenance phase. The inland letter would have mainly objective&#13;
questions with yes/ no answers and would also have writing space for answers to few&#13;
subjective questions. This would include information directly related to the issues of&#13;
concern to the community and which DWSC/ZP would like to utilize for monitoring the&#13;
performance in completed schemes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Th~e information coming on key issues would be assigned marks and would be fed into the&#13;
  computer for analysis and use .The information sent will be analyzed and directly used for&#13;
  pre~paring the PIC at the scheme level. DWSC/ZP would also analyze and send&#13;
  feedback/suggestions to communities based on the information received through inland&#13;
  letter system, in case there is a need for it.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Feedback report&#13;
&#13;
  In order to foster transparency, and to provide the community with full access to the&#13;
  computerised MIS, some paper-based feedback reports in local language would be&#13;
  forwarded on a regular basis to the communities. They would thus exactly know what is&#13;
  recorded in the database about their scheme and may revert back to DWSC/ZP in case&#13;
  th1~y find any discrepancy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  4.       Integration Mechanism&#13;
&#13;
  4.1      Performance Index Card (PIC)&#13;
&#13;
  The Performance Index Card (PIC) is the integrating mechanism of the system. The PIC&#13;
  would integrate the various components of the M&amp;E system and act as the key&#13;
  mechanism for evaluating and comparing the performance across project schemes,&#13;
  across districts and across states.&#13;
&#13;
  Tine computerised MIS would generate three sets of PICs, one each for Village, District&#13;
  and State levels. Whereas the PICs would function as an instrument of self-assessment to&#13;
  b~~ used by the project village, districts and states for their own learning and improvement&#13;
  on a continuous basis, the use of state PIC by the GOI might include streamlining the&#13;
  release of funds to states by linking it to project performance.&#13;
&#13;
  The quantitative component of District PIC would have 80% village performance and 20%&#13;
  District performance. This latter 20% comprises of 10% marks based on the District MIS&#13;
  indicators and the remaining 10% in the form of a bonus for qualifying for the Nirmal Gram&#13;
  Puraskar. The qualitative component of the District PIC would comprise 20% of&#13;
  performance against C-M&amp;E and 80% on performance against periodic review. The&#13;
  quantitative component of State PIC would comprise of 80% based on district and village&#13;
  performance and 20% on State performance. The qualitative aspect would comprise of&#13;
  4% of performance against C-M&amp;E and 16% against district periodic review and 80% of&#13;
  performance in the State periodic review.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢       The structure of the PIC&#13;
&#13;
  The structure of the PIC would be identical for State and District and slightly adapted for&#13;
  schemes. The State and District PIC would have two components: MIS-based quantitative&#13;
  information and field-based qualitative information collected through periodic reviews.&#13;
  Qualitative information would basically be made available through periodic reviews&#13;
  commissioned by RGNDWM for State and by SWSM for Districts, and the corresponding&#13;
  score would be taken and entered in State and District PICs as appropriate. Scheme PIC&#13;

The PIC would capture performance related to water supply, which is referred to as core&#13;
performance and also potentially to other related dimensions such as sanitation, hygiene&#13;
and health, water resources management and water quality monitoring.&#13;

  4.3    System of benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
  The system of benchmarking would also be used for making comparisons across states&#13;
  and districts as per a set of pre-defined benchmarks. Benchmarks basically comprise of a&#13;
  set of indicators carrying numerical reference values against which the actual project&#13;
  measures would be compared to. System of benchmarks is being employed under the&#13;
  IM&amp;E system as a tool in an overall strategy aimed at the effective implementation of best&#13;
  practice&#13;
&#13;
  Benchmarking is the process of identifying, sharing, and using best practices to improve&#13;
  processes .For simplicity benchmarking covers exercises comparing data (usually key&#13;
  performance indicators) or tracking performance over time. Whilst these provide&#13;
  comparative measures, they do not in themselves result in the identification or exchange&#13;
  of best practice. Benchmarking examines processes, compares the activities and seeks to&#13;
  identify best practices that can be implemented, so effecting performance improvement.&#13;

 Benchmarks use ratios and percentages to give results -an overall picture that reflects&#13;
 attainment against the desired level/target. Benchmarks under .Swajaldhara will comprise&#13;
 mainly of numerical reference values so that it can be objectively measured.&#13;
&#13;
 Benchmarking will promote:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢     The exchange of best practice in pursuit of general objectives.&#13;
       â&#128;¢     Stakeholders to make informed decisions about initiating actions for&#13;
             improvement.&#13;
       â&#128;¢     Setting performance targets for ensuring sustainability of investments and&#13;
             benefits.&#13;
       â&#128;¢     Information to identify areas where there is an apparent performance gap.&#13;

       â&#128;¢     Usage, Maintenance and Sustainability of Sanitation Assets (UMS).&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring of benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
Benchmarks would be monitored directly through the information flow against indicators&#13;
being proposed for monitoring of activities. However the monitoring of benchmarks would&#13;
also heavily thrive on the periodic review component and community monitoring system&#13;
being proposed under the monitoring and evaluation system after exit from a village.&#13;
&#13;
The information being fed in the computer, based on indicators, would generate status of&#13;
attainment of benchmarks and a report for each state on actual attainment against desired&#13;
level can be generated.&#13;

&#13;
5.1    Strategy for Management of Proposed M &amp; E of Total Sanitation Campaign&#13;
&#13;
Currently, in many states water supply and sanitation are being managed independently&#13;
by separate organizations. However, it is envisaged that States would implement water&#13;
supply and sanitation in an integrated manner and existing SWSM, DWSMs and VWSCs&#13;
at the state, district and village levels would be responsible for both water supply and&#13;
sanitation and all their various dimensions. The proposed M&amp;E system of TSC would rely&#13;
heavily on the proposed institutional arrangement i.e. DWSM and SWSM for managing&#13;
the reform projects.&#13;
&#13;
In line with the above scenario in which water supply and sanitation are being jointly&#13;
managed by the same implementing/facilitating agencies/organizations at all levels, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                            Knowledge Links&#13;
                                                                                      Private Limited&#13;

  anticipated that there would be substantial savings in the management costs of the M&amp;E&#13;
  system. The following costs should be common and shared by both projects:&#13;
&#13;
        ~     Hardware and software costs at the state and districUsub-divisional levels&#13;
        ~     Costs of conducting the State and District Periodic Reviews as they can be&#13;
              jointly conducted. Only if there are villages in which only TSC or only&#13;
              Swajaldhara are being implemented in isolation, costs would have to be&#13;
              booked separately under the respective programmes by concerned&#13;
              departmenUagency.&#13;
        ~     Training of trainers on MIS, periodic review and community monitoring can&#13;
              also be done jointly as the components and methods to be followed are very&#13;
              similar in nature.&#13;
        ~     The costs to be incurred on additional staff members also will be common as&#13;
              these staff members will be handling the M&amp;E workload of both Swajaldhara&#13;
              and TSC.&#13;
&#13;
  5.2   Suggested Management Structure&#13;
&#13;
  The proposed M &amp; E system comprises of three main components, namely a&#13;
  computerized MIS system which is quantitative in nature, a qualitative component which&#13;
  consists of a periodic review process and a community monitoring system. It is a bottom-&#13;
  up system, which has specified formats, and reports in which data has to be either&#13;
  recorded manually or fed into a computerized system.&#13;
&#13;
  5.2.1 Village Level&#13;
&#13;
  At the village level, the VWSC itself will be trained and made responsible to fill the&#13;
  necessary data in the formats prescribed by the proposed M &amp; E design during the&#13;
  !?Ianning and Implementation Phases. These formats will then be handed over to the&#13;
  concerned DWSC/ Core Group functionary at district level who is responsible for&#13;
  "facilitation and project management of that particular TSC village. During the O&amp;M Phase,&#13;
  the VWSC will collect the relevant data using different methods and tools and fill it in the&#13;
  Inland Letter Format and send it by post bi-monthly to the DWSC. The training of VWSC&#13;
  and other responsible community members in M &amp; E methods and procedures may be&#13;
  conducted by a suitable NGO or training institution appointed for the purpose. Initially, the&#13;
  trainers will also have to be trained in these methods by persons who are proficient in the&#13;
  administration of the proposed M&amp;E module for TSC.&#13;
&#13;
  5.2.2 District level&#13;
&#13;
 According to the TSC guidelines the district is envisaged to be        the focal point for the&#13;
 overall management of projects. Zilla Parishad/Panchayat (ZP)           would be the agency&#13;
 responsible for overall project planning and management at the         district level. In cases&#13;
 where there is no ZP, a DWSC will have to be specially constituted     for the purpose.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A core group of multi-disciplinary professionals would need to be set up at the district&#13;
level. It is proposed that the members of this core group at the district level carry the&#13;
required experience and skills in Communication, Human Resource Development,&#13;
Monitoring and School Sanitation &amp; Hygiene Education etc.&#13;
&#13;
The management structure suggested presupposes the presence of a full-time project&#13;
manager at the district level. Ideally it would be desirable to have a district project&#13;
manager for the purpose. However, in case of member secretary, DWSC being the overall&#13;
in-charge, which is generally an ex-officio position, it is recommended that suitable full&#13;
time project management assistance is made available for day-to-day management of&#13;
project activities. The same would be applicable where Zilla Parishad/Panchayat is&#13;
managing the project at the district level.&#13;
&#13;
The district project manager would need to be assisted by a core group of multi-&#13;
disciplinary professionals as indicated above. One of the team members must be a&#13;
monitoring and evaluation specialist, who is designated as the M&amp;E coordinator and is&#13;
entrusted with the responsibility of day-to-day management of the designed M&amp;E system.&#13;
Other professionals in the core group should be given the responsibility of field&#13;
coordinators. Each field coordinator would be allocated a number of villages/schemes and&#13;
would be responsible for supervising the work being done on the ground in the project&#13;
villages.&#13;
&#13;
For the purposes of data entry, the M&amp;E coordinator would be assisted by one or two data&#13;
entry operators as per requirement. However, the actual number of data entry operators&#13;
and field coordinators in the district team would vary as per the number of villages actually&#13;
undertaken under TSC in a particular district.&#13;
&#13;
The field coordinators (core group members) shall ensure timely collection of data from&#13;
the VWSC as per the input formats designed and periodicity of collection agreed for the&#13;
purpose and make it available to the M&amp;E;: coordinator at the district level for its entry into&#13;
the computerized system by data entry operators. It would be the responsibility of the&#13;
M&amp;E coordinator to make sure that all data entered in the system is cross-checked by at&#13;
least one more person to avoid any errors of omission and commission.&#13;
&#13;
5.23 State level&#13;
&#13;
Within the TSC framework, the State Government should set up an appropriate&#13;
institutional arrangement to monitor the projects and facilitate the districts in implementing&#13;
TSC. However, in states where water supply &amp; sanitation are handled by two different&#13;
departments, separate institutional set up may also be made subject to the condition that&#13;
officials handling water supply should be actively associated with this.&#13;
&#13;
In view of the above, the states have been given a role in operationalising the designed&#13;
M&amp;E system both in terms of coordinating various functions related to the management of&#13;
the computerised MIS at the state and district levels on the one hand and organising&#13;
periodic review exercise in the TSC districts on a regular basis on the other.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 The purpose of the periodic review exercise would be to identify areas of weakness in&#13;
 implementation and suggest measures for mid-course corrections and desired&#13;
 improvements. A full time M&amp;E coordinator would be required to carry out all the&#13;
 ne~cessary management functions in this regard at the state level. The M&amp;E coordinator at&#13;
 th1:! state level would report to the member secretary SWSM.&#13;
&#13;
  5.2.4 National level&#13;
&#13;
 As per the proposed M&amp;E system, RGNDWM at the Government of India level has the&#13;
 most crucial role in terms of an efficient and effective functioning of the system being&#13;
 de~signed. Some of the key functions of the system include web management related to&#13;
 IT-based MIS and parts of benchmarking, Performance Index Card (PIC) and the periodic&#13;
 review component of the system to be managed at the national level. Hence, a full time&#13;
 dedicated monitoring and evaluation coordinator has to be identified and placed at the&#13;
 RGNDWM level for managing the system.&#13;
&#13;
 The actual management of the web-based M&amp;E MIS has to be done centrally at the&#13;
 RGNDWM level on a day-to-day basis. A panel of professionals would be prepared at the&#13;
 national level for the periodic review proposed to be carried out in each TSC state once in&#13;
 a year by RGNDWM. The professionals have to be selected on the basis of their&#13;
 experience and expertise in the sector. A list of professionals is reportedly already drawn&#13;
 at RGNDWM.&#13;
&#13;
 Operationalisation of this suggested management structure is dependent on appropriate&#13;
 and adequate capacity building, particularly training and technical assistance, to be&#13;
 carried out for desired skill up-gradation of the personnel involved at various levels.&#13;

       1           Introduction&#13;
&#13;
 1.1    Context&#13;
&#13;
 Sanitation is an essential precondition of improvement in the quality of life of people. Lack&#13;
 of awareness regarding critical linkages between sanitation, hygiene and health lie at the&#13;
 root of unsafe sanitary practices such as open defecation resulting in avoidable morbidity&#13;
 andl mortality, especially of children in India, on a large scale every year.&#13;
&#13;
 For many years, sanitation programmes have concentrated mainly on promoting the&#13;
 construction of sanitary latrines at the individual household level, but with very little impact&#13;
 on the quality of life of people. This is primarily because some sanitary latrines at the&#13;
 individual household level amidst the vast majority still defecating in the open brings no&#13;
 substantial difference in the prevailing state of affairs, as all the community members&#13;
 remain exposed to the killing fecal-oral route of disease transmission resulting in&#13;
 enormous amount of loss of human life and productivity. Hence, a community resolve to&#13;
 put an end to open defecation and create a fully sanitized village (no less than 100%) is of&#13;
 paramount importance.&#13;
&#13;
 The concept of sanitation is now not limited merely to the disposal of human excreta, but&#13;
 has widened to include fundamental changes in the hygiene and health seeking behaviour&#13;
 of people. This is about breaking the transmission route of fecal-oral transmission of&#13;
 diseases. In order to make this happen in an effective manner, one needs to have an&#13;
 approach of total sanitation that not only involves construction of individual and&#13;
 community sanitary latrines, but also the facilities for safe solid waste management and&#13;
 waste water disposal, drainage etc. But above all else, the most critical factor in sanitation&#13;
 is one of human behaviour, which is determined by a number of socio-economic and&#13;
 cultural factors that need to be effectively addressed in order to achieve the goal of total&#13;
 sanitation. A number of empirical studies have indicated that, the factors of self-respect,&#13;
 self-motivation, convenience and privacy have been of greater significance, as against the&#13;
 subsidy for household sanitary latrines.&#13;
&#13;
 In terms of strategy to address the issue of sanitation, the conventional one of providing&#13;
 subsidies to individual households for constructing sanitary latrines has not really worked&#13;
 in any significant sense. It is now being increasingly realized that sanitation is essentially&#13;
 a community issue and effective results can be achieved only with the help of active&#13;
 community involvement. There is also a need to send this message across to all the&#13;
 potential users of sanitation services, particularly the poor, that having sanitary latrines is&#13;
 easy and affordable. All one needs is to have the conviction and commitment to do so.&#13;
 This can be done by developing and presenting a range of region-specific technology&#13;
 options (from almost no-cost to low-cost to medium-cost to high-cost) to the people to&#13;
 choose from and to innovate, if required.&#13;

Chapter 1 - Introduction&#13;
&amp;#12;1.2 Total Sanitation Campaign â&#128;¢ A Historical Perspective&#13;
&#13;
The Goverment of India launched the Central Rural Sanitation Programme (CRSP) in&#13;
1986, to give an impetus to sanitation efforts of the State Rural Sanitation Programmes&#13;
(SRSPs) being implemented by the State Governments. In order to enhance sanitation&#13;
coverage even further, in 1993, the Government of India revised the guidelines of CRSP,&#13;
providing higher budgetary allocations, thereby giving a boost to this sector. As a result of&#13;
the heightened efforts taken during the 9th Plan Period, the coverage of total households&#13;
amongst the States varied between 16-20%, which still left a lot of room for improvement&#13;
(As per the Census 2001, rural sanitation coverage in india was 22%). In view of the&#13;
widening connotation of sanitation, and in consonance with the spirit of the reform&#13;
approach in the drinking water supply sector, based on the strategy outlined in Ninth Plan,&#13;
the CRSP was restructured into a "demand-driven" and people-centered programme to be&#13;
implemented in a campaign project mode and christened as the Total Sanitation&#13;
Campaign (TSC).&#13;
&#13;
This programme is being implemented in project mode in around 400 identified districts.&#13;
The revised approach in the programme emphasizes more on Information, Education and&#13;
Communication (IEC) activities to increase awareness with a focus on community-led and&#13;
people-centred initiatives. It implies the institutionalization of a "community action&#13;
planning" model in which the users actively assess, analyze and plan solutions to their&#13;
own problems, leading to action and self-monitoring. It equally addresses the needs,&#13;
preferences and behaviour of children, women and men and, while guarding against the&#13;
danger of placing the burden of improved sanitation on women, it clearly fosters a gender-&#13;
sensitive approach. There is a special focus on school sanitation and a central theme is&#13;
the continuous promotion of hygiene and sanitation. The people-centered approach of the&#13;
TSC is aimed not only at promoting health and preventing disease, but intends to foster a&#13;
sense of ownership of sanitation assets created within the community, which is paramount&#13;
for sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
Reform Principles of the TSC&#13;
&#13;
TSC makes major departures from the existing supply-driven approach through enabling&#13;
the communities to demand sanitary facilities and make informed choices regarding&#13;
formation of user committees, site selection, technology options, material procurement,&#13;
construction supervision, sustained usage, operation and maintenance of the assets&#13;
created. Some of the main reform principles made part of TSC are as below:&#13;
&#13;
      ~     community-based approaches andprocesses,&#13;
      ~     creation ofan enabling environment&#13;
      ~     promotion of usage of sanitary facilities&#13;
      ~     sustainability of assets created through ongoing operation and maintenance&#13;
      ~     change in personal, domestic and environmental health and hygiene&#13;
            behaviour/practices&#13;

Chapter 1 - Introduction&#13;
&amp;#12;  1.3 Campaign Objectives&#13;
&#13;
 The main thrust of the Total Sanitation campaign is shift from a high subsidy to a low&#13;
 subsidy regime, greater household involvement, choice of technology according to&#13;
 customer preferences, stress on software activities for capacity building,&#13;
 institutionalization of participative processes and development of back-up services. The&#13;
 main objectives of the TSC, as stated in the RGNDWM guidelines are to:&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Bring about an improvement in the general quality oflife in the rural areas.&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Accelerate sanitation coverage in rural areas.&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Generate felt demand for samlation fact!ities through awareness creation and&#13;
             health education.&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Cover schools/Anganwadis in rural areas with samlation factltlies and promote&#13;
             hygiene education and sanitary habits among students.&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Encourage cost effective and appropriate technologies in Sanitation.&#13;
        â&#128;¢    Eliminate open defecation to minimize risk of contamination of drinking water&#13;
             sources and food&#13;
       â&#128;¢     Convert dry latrines to pour flush latrines, and eliminate manual scavenging&#13;
             practice, wherever in existence in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
 1.4 Campaign Components&#13;
&#13;
 Towards achievement of the above-mentioned objectives, the various components and&#13;
 activities of TSC include the following:&#13;
&#13;
 a)    Start-up Activities (&lt;5% of outlay subject to a ceiling of Rs. 20 lakh per district),&#13;
       which include conducting a baseline survey, preparation of project implementation&#13;
       plan, initial orientation and training of key project managers at the district level,&#13;
       publicity etc. It is expected that proposals will be developed based on the results of&#13;
       the survey. (100% Gol)&#13;
&#13;
 b)    IEC Activities (&gt;15% of outlay) for creating a demand for the toilets at the&#13;
       household, school, Anganwadi, Balwadi and community level. This will include wall&#13;
       paintings, hoardings, and audio-video clippings on Doordarshan, AIR etc. (80% Gol&#13;
       and 20% State)&#13;
&#13;
 c)    Rural Sanitation Marts and Production Centers (&gt;,5% of outlay subject to a&#13;

1.5 Campaign Organization Structure and Role of Different Organizations/&#13;
    Institutions&#13;
&#13;
The Zila Parishad (ZP) is the main implementing Agency at District level assisted by the&#13;
District Water and Sanitation Committee (DWSC) and the District Water and Sanitation&#13;
Mission (DWSM) which are multi-sectoral bodies composed of different officials/&#13;
individuals closely linked with the ongoing sanitation efforts. The district proposals are&#13;
scrutinized by the State Government and sent to GOI for approval by the National&#13;
Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC). The role of different organizations and&#13;
institutions - both governmental and non-governmental - at community, district, state and&#13;
national levels is briefly outlined below:&#13;
&#13;
1.5.1 Community-based Organizations and PRis: At the village level, representative&#13;
user committees i.e. Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs) shall be formed,&#13;
which would be responsible for day-to-day informed decisions regarding the planning and&#13;
implementation of the project. The PRis have a mandated role in TSC, because, as per&#13;
the 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, of the Constitution, sanitation is included in the 11th&#13;
Schedule. They have a clear role to play in the mobilization of the community in order that&#13;
they are informed and aware enough to demand for sanitation facilities, whether they are&#13;
individual or community items. Their other responsibilities include the proper and safe&#13;
disposal of liquid and solid waste thereby maintaining a clean environment, which actually&#13;
acts as a 'barrier to disease', custody and maintenance of community items like&#13;
community sanitary complexes and drainage and augmentation of resources towards the&#13;
construction of school sanitation facilities. If the community expresses the need for a&#13;
Rural Sanitary Mart (RSM) or a Production Centre (PC), the Gram Panchayat can also&#13;
construct, operate and maintain these assets.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1.5.2 CBOs: Community based organizations like self-help groups, Mahila Mandals,&#13;
 Yuvak Mandals, PTAs, MTAs etc., if so empowered and capable, may also take on some&#13;
 of these above responsibilities. These initiatives form an integral part of rendering this&#13;
 project into a community-led and people-centred one, leading to increased demand,&#13;
 change in behaviour and practices in the community, resulting in usage and sustainability&#13;
 of the assets created.&#13;
&#13;
 1.5.3 NGOs: The role of NGOs envisaged is mainly for creating change in the knowledge,&#13;
 attitude and practices of the community members. For this to happen, NGOs are&#13;
 supposed to undertake information sharing and awareness creation coupled with intense,&#13;
 preferably 'hands-on' capacity-building efforts. They may however, also participate in TSC&#13;
 activities by establishing RSMs and PCs, depending on the community's need and their&#13;
 capacity to take on such tasks.&#13;
&#13;
 1.5.4 Zila Panchayat, DWSC, DWSM: At the District level, the Zila Panchayat will have a&#13;
 cardinal role as the Implementing Agency. After it has managed the IEC campaign and&#13;
 facilitated the creation of an enabling environment at all levels, it will be responsible for&#13;
 scrutinizing village proposals and consolidating these into a comprehensive district&#13;
 proposal for submission to the central and State Governments. Subsequent to the&#13;
 sanction of proposals, it will facilitate the day-to-day implementation of the project,&#13;
 institutionalize and functionalize the monitoring and evaluation system and will also be the&#13;
 recruiting body for NGOs and any other consultants/organizations whenever required by&#13;
 the project. The District Water and Sanitation Mission and Committee will both be&#13;
 complementary arms of the ZP and they will ensure that there is co-ordination and&#13;
 synergy between all the concerned line departments towards the integrated delivery of&#13;
 water supply and sanitation in the district, resulting in reduction in water-borne diseases,&#13;
 thereby guaranteeing a better quality of life for the communities involved.&#13;
&#13;
 '1.5.5 State Water and Sanitation Mission (SWSM): The State will have more of an&#13;
 advisory role and ensure co-ordinating, monitoring and evaluation of progress and&#13;
 achievements of TSC. The SWSM will also scrutinize all district proposals submitted by&#13;
 the districts, make timely budgetary allocation to the districts subsequent to sanction,&#13;
 eonduct periodic reviews of district level personnel and achievements, evaluate the&#13;
 district's performance as a whole and be responsible for the state-wide performance&#13;
 under this project.&#13;
&#13;
 1.5.6 National Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC), Dept. of Drinking Water&#13;
        Supply, Ministry of Rural Development, GOI: Proposals received from the&#13;
        districts, through the StaJe channel, will be examined by the NSSC, which will be&#13;
        chaired by the Secretary, Department of Drinking Water Supply, Ministry of Rural&#13;
        Development. The Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission will also have the&#13;
        mandate of arranging for periodic reviews of the States' performance with regard&#13;
        to TSC and evaluating and revisiting TSC policies and guidelines accordingly.&#13;

1.6 Conceptual Approach to the M&amp;E of Rural Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
1.6.1 Current Reporting and Monitoring Practices&#13;
&#13;
The GOI has already put in place a reasonably supportive progress monitoring system&#13;
comprising the following:&#13;
&#13;
      ~     Monthly and cumulative annual progress reports - both physical and financial&#13;
            (Annexure) to be submitted by each participating state to GOI.&#13;
      ~     Project Implementation Plan (PIP) to define the MIS process and type of&#13;
            indicators.&#13;
      ~     Template for Periodic review.&#13;
      ~     Household Survey Questionnaire.&#13;
      ~     Project District Sanitation Data Base.&#13;
&#13;
A provision for regular field inspections by state and district officials has been made to&#13;
supervise the following:&#13;
      â&#128;¢    Construction work has been done as per norms,&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Community involvement in the construction,&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Latrines are not polluting the water sources,&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Proper selection of beneficiaries,&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Proper use of the constructed facilities,&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Display of TSC information in the Gram Panchayat.&#13;
Another M&amp;E tool of the existing system is the system of periodic evaluation studies to&#13;
be conducted by the states/UTs. A list of categories have also been drawn up for&#13;
reporting on TSC Projects under the four heads, namely, enabling environment, project&#13;
implementation, use and impact oflatrines and specific comments.&#13;

&#13;
 Besides this, GOI may organize implementation review (Periodic Review System) twice&#13;
 a year for a group of TSC projects in a state through a multi-agency team. In the districts&#13;
 and villages visited, these teams are tasked to assess the following aspects:&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Methodology of project implementation and implementation status and quality,&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Start-up Activities -the Baseline Survey and preparation of the PIP,&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Institutional Arrangements,&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Role of NGOs and PRis,&#13;
        â&#128;¢     IEC Plan, activities and impact in terms of awareness of the project and&#13;
              willingness to participate and share the cost,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Capacity Building Plan, Activities and Implementation,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Appropriateness, soundness and cost of technology options in Sanitation and&#13;
              community participation in its selection,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Hygiene Education,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Community Participation in Construction quality and 0 &amp; M arrangements for&#13;
              both individual and community sanitary facilities,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Financial Management,&#13;
       â&#128;¢      State Level Operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 There is also a web-based online progress tracking system instituted by GOI. But it&#13;
 does not capture the qualitative and the process-based reform aspects of TSC.&#13;
&#13;
 The existing M &amp; E system has been thoroughly reviewed and most of the elements have&#13;
 been incorporated into the proposed M &amp; E module for TSC. It has been ensured that&#13;
 many of the existing tools would feed into the proposed M &amp; E system with suitable&#13;
 amendments, so that there is a comprehensive coverage of all the components and&#13;
 processes involved. There will also be an integration of all M&amp;E procedures in order to&#13;
 have a holistic evaluation of the entire project.&#13;
&#13;
 1.6.2 Log-frame of the proposed M&amp;E Design of TSC&#13;
&#13;
 Though the existing M &amp; E system being followed by GOI is fairly thorough in capturing&#13;
 physical and financial progress indicators of the project, it misses out on the qualitative&#13;
 dimensions of TSC programme planning and implementation on the ground. In view of the&#13;
 TSC being a process-based reform initiative, there is a felt need to develop an M &amp; E&#13;
 design which incorporates qualitative aspects like generation of demand and creation of&#13;
 an enabling environment resulting in the community's enhanced demand for household&#13;
 and community latrines, promotion of different types of technology for sanitation facilities&#13;
 suited to local needs and conditions, and their sustained maintenance and usage.&#13;
 Moreover, the current M &amp; E system does not take into account the views and perceptions&#13;
 of the community, nor the efficacy of the processes followed by them. Such an omission&#13;
&#13;

can only prove detrimental to the spirit of the reform process inherent in this project.&#13;
Therefore, the proposed M &amp; E system, is only a reorganization of the elements of the&#13;
existing TSC monitoring system, while incorporating certain aspects, which make this&#13;
programme different from it's predecessors.&#13;
&#13;
The M&amp;E system designed for the Swajaldhara program has the provision of plugging in&#13;
thematic modules into the system as per requirement. The sanitation module (Total&#13;
Sanitation Campaign) is the first in the series, which is being developed currently and is&#13;
proposed to be plugged in into the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system already developed and&#13;
commissioned in the RGNDWM and in two states of UP and TN. The integrated dellivery&#13;
of these two programmes in some states will provide a suitable platform for the launching&#13;
of this plug-in module.&#13;
&#13;
Developing appropriate indicators is the key to effectiveness of an M&amp;E system. The&#13;
indicators have been developed on the basis of a logical framework, which is based on&#13;
the overall reform goal of the TSC programme and its underlying assumptions, as&#13;
articulated on the basis of main objectives of the TSC. The logical framework takes into&#13;
account the objectives, strategy and various components of the program as spelt out in&#13;
the TSC guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
The strategy as spelt out in the TSC guidelines is to make the programme "community&#13;
led" and "people centred" and the approach is "demand driven" with increased stress on&#13;
awareness creation and demand generation from the people for sanitary facilities in&#13;
houses, schools and for cleaner environment.&#13;
&#13;
The underlying principles of TSC have been worked out on the basis of the objectives of&#13;
the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). The critical functions flow from the reform principles&#13;
inherent in the programme framework. These critical functions related to each of the&#13;
principles form the basis of developing objectively verifiable indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The predominant principle underlying the entire TSC program design is one of creation of&#13;
sanitation facilities in response to the felt demand for the same. The chosen strategy to&#13;
realize this principle into practice is to create awareness through appropriate IEC&#13;
activities with a focus on hygiene and health education. In view of the above, the&#13;
logical framework is presented in the following two tables. Table 1.1 presents the&#13;
objectives of the program as contained in the TSC guidelines and the under~ying&#13;
assumptions of the objectives as worked out on that basis. Table 1.2 presents the goal&#13;
and purpose of the TSC program, spells out the principles, critical functions in terms of&#13;
various program components. However, a column titled "phase" has been included to&#13;
articulate the principles and functions in terms of phase (though the program design is in&#13;
terms of components and not in terms of phases) as well, so as to ensure its compatibility&#13;
with the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system design. On the basis of these principles, critical&#13;
functions and the components involved, the indicators, their type i.e. measuring process,&#13;
physical progress or financial progress, means of their verification in the proposed M &amp; E&#13;

                                                  and expenditure priorities.&#13;
 Eliminate open defecation to minimize risk       Elimination of open defecation would&#13;
 of contamination of drinking water sources       eliminate the dispersal of fecal material and&#13;
 and food                                         related micro-organisms and thus result in&#13;
                                                  minimising the risk of contamination of&#13;

 Convert dry latrines to pour flush latrines,     Practice of dry latrines and manual&#13;
 and   eliminate     manual      scavenging,      scavenging is unsanitary and carries a high&#13;
 wherever in existence in rural areas             risk of dispersal of faeces, particularly&#13;
                                                  during transit and at disposal points.&#13;
                                                  Besides, manual scavenging is not only&#13;
                                                  degrading for people engaged in carrying it&#13;
                                                  out but also highly risky for their health as&#13;
                                                  well. Therefore, this practice leads to health&#13;
                                                  hazards and needs to be stopped, wherever&#13;
                                                  in existence. Converting dry latrines into&#13;
                                                  pour flush latrines would automatically lead&#13;
                                                  to elimination of manual scavenging.&#13;
&#13;
 One of the major considerations in developing the indicators has been to ensure their&#13;
 compatibility with the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system mainly in terms of the data base design,&#13;
 as the TSC module would have to be plugged in into the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system&#13;
 already designed and commissioned in UP and Tamil Nadu to begin with.&#13;
&#13;
 The number of indicators have been deliberately kept limited to ensure collection of only&#13;
 that information, which is easy to get and reliable and is more likely to be used by the&#13;
 intended users. The limited number of indicators would also help avoid unnecessary&#13;

 1.6.3 Key Elements and Assumptions of M&amp;E Design&#13;
&#13;
 The proposed M &amp; E design will be driven by and encompass the following elements and&#13;
 assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     The states and districts implementing TSC would have the willingness to adopt the&#13;
       system as an instrument of strategic learning and action especially to use it to make&#13;
       mid-course corrections whenever necessary. The emergence of recorded benefits&#13;
       early on would also help reinforce ownership, and early warning of emerging&#13;
       problems would allow for timely action to be taken before costs rise.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     The states and districts would have the technological and infrastructural capability to&#13;
       run a web-based M &amp; E system. Initially, the module would be launched in states&#13;
       and districts where the Swajaldhara M &amp; E module is being used already, as they&#13;
       would be having the necessary hardware and software to run the module.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     The M&amp;E system could also be effectively used to capture the best practices in the&#13;
       sector in terms of the community based processes and their functioning in realizing&#13;
       the goal of total sanitation at the village level.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     In line with the current policy intent of integrating the delivery of water and sanitation&#13;
       services, the TSC M&amp;E system has been conceived in the context of existing&#13;
       Swajaldhara M&amp;E system of which it would form an integral part as one of its plug-in&#13;
       modules Hence, to avoid repetition and overlap, indicators related to the constitution&#13;
       and training of VWSC, integrated service delivery etc. have not been included in this&#13;

 â&#128;¢     "Nirmal Gram Puraskar" (NGP), announced by the Government of India under TSC,&#13;
       is basically an incentive scheme, aimed at promoting fully sanitized&#13;
       GPs/Biocks/Districts. The four conditions to be met by GPs/Biocks/Districts in order&#13;
       to be eligible for NGP are (a) 100%sanitation coverage of individual households (b)&#13;
       100% school sanitation coverage (c) free from open defecation, dry latrines and&#13;
       manual scavenging (d) clean environment maintenance. The proposed M&amp;E design&#13;
       incorporates monitoring of this reward system in both the qualitative and quantitative&#13;

1.6.4 Implications and Challenges&#13;
&#13;
The implications of the use of the TSC M&amp;E module are envisaged to be far-reaching and&#13;
wide. As a plug-in module of the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system, it would inherently work&#13;
towards integrated monitoring of reform oriented community based water and sanitation&#13;
projects. This would help understand the processes involved in the integrated planning&#13;
and management of water and sanitation services at the community level, which could in&#13;
turn inform macro policy perspectives and micro operational strategies for sector wide&#13;
reform initiatives in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Another practical implication of the system is in terms of cost effectiveness. The&#13;
institutional arrangements for project planning and management of Swajaldhara and TSC&#13;
could be kept the same to ensure a more integrated and effective delivery of services,&#13;
which would also be cost effective. Moreover, the periodic review exercises could be&#13;
undertaken simultaneously to optimize on learning, which would also automatically save&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
The greatest challenge of the M&amp;E system (both Swajaldhara and TSC) is to create an&#13;
institutional culture and climate of adopting monitoring and evaluation as a critical&#13;
programme activity in learning and action, aimed at realizing the reform goals both in&#13;
water and sanitation. As a result, the system design is flexible and open and allows for a&#13;
broad based two way communication between project managers and user communities,&#13;
instead of having a closed, one way, linear communication channel.&#13;
&#13;
Ownership of a system and the data it generates are major factors that affect the efficacy&#13;
of an M&amp;E system and in this aspect, all project partners and functionaries at community,&#13;
district and state level need to feel that they have an essential role to play in the collection&#13;
and analysis of information. There has to be an inbuilt incentive to do better. The&#13;
proposed M&amp;E design addresses this through the mechanism of Performance Index Card&#13;
(PIC), which allots scores to different indicators and integrates the whole system in a&#13;
manner that generates an overall rating for each village, district and state. This PIC score&#13;
forms the basis on which they will be graded and even if they do not make it to the top of&#13;
the heap, they will constantly try to improve their own score. This will give them the&#13;
necessary stimulus to adhere to the M&amp;E system and develop a sense of ownership of&#13;
the same.&#13;
&#13;
1.6.5 Overall frame'f"!ork of Proposed M&amp;E system of TSC&#13;
&#13;
In view of the above considerations, the proposed M &amp; E system for TSC takes into&#13;
account both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of the programme with the help&#13;
of two windows of the same name. The quantitative window is based on objectively&#13;
verifiable indicators, which relate to process and physical and financial progress. These&#13;
indicators also take into account the current information requirements of the programme&#13;
managers at the national, state and district levels in the form of Monthly Progress&#13;
Reports, which would be generated by the related web-based computerized MIS system.&#13;

                                                                          Tlltl!l Sllilllr!lll l::ll!1SIIItiil!l&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 The qualitative window has two systems of periodic review and community monitoring. A&#13;
 system of periodic reviews (PR) proposed at the state, district and comml,lnity levels by a&#13;
 team composed of multidisciplinary professionals, officers and experts in the field will be&#13;
 an essential part of the qualitative component of the proposed M&amp;E system. The&#13;
 concurrent M&amp;E system of the TSC already follows a periodic review system and the&#13;
 proposed system has taken into account the indicators developed for the same. The&#13;
 indicators developed under the periodic review have been derived from the guiding&#13;
 priinciples and objectives of the programme and have been assigned scores so that they&#13;
 ane quantified, in order to be reflected in the PIC system.&#13;
&#13;
 Another distinct component in the form of Community Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (C-M&amp;E)&#13;
 system has been proposed to capture the qualitative aspects. The community will be&#13;
 providedwith tools and techniques and trained in their use so that they can monitor critical&#13;
 issues of importance on their own even after the project implementation is over. The&#13;
 CIVI&amp;E will also inform the project management through a system of inland letters on&#13;
 critical issues. A mechanism of providing regular feedback to the community is there in&#13;
 the system in the form of sending feedback letters to the community.&#13;
&#13;
 The two features of the system namely performance index card (PIC) and benchmarking&#13;
 feed on both the quantitative and qualitative windows of the system. The computerized&#13;
 MIS would also generate Performance Index Cards at village, district and state levels,&#13;
 which would help compare performance across all these levels. This would also work as a&#13;
 mechanism for self-assessment by project villages, districts and states. The system of&#13;
 benchmarking, which is a feature both of the quantitative and qualitative windows, would&#13;
 help compare performance across project states on the basis of some benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
 The details of the PIC system and benchmarks are available in the chapter on "Integration&#13;
 Mechanism".&#13;

1.7 Issues related to plugging in (TSC module in Swajaldhara M&amp;E)&#13;
&#13;
There are states/ districts where TSC is being implemented independent of Swajaldhara&#13;
and is being facilitated by a different line department from the one looking after drinking&#13;
water supply. In these locations, this module will have to be administered in an&#13;
independent manner and the PIC also will reflect only the performance of the Sanitation&#13;
component.&#13;
&#13;
The integrated delivery of drinking water and sanitation is fundamental to the functionality,&#13;
usage and sustainability of assets created and the concomitant change in health and&#13;
hygiene behaviour and practices of the people using them. As such, it will not be prudent&#13;
to have separate delivery of both, by different implementing and facili~ating&#13;
agencies/bodies at the various project levels. In the Swajaldhara M &amp; E module, there are&#13;
certain indicators, especially in the qualitative part, which pertain to the vibrancy and&#13;
efficacy of these agencies/bodies in the implementation and facilitation of TSC activities&#13;
and integrated delivery, to which there are scores assigned and these scores are inpluded&#13;
in the overall PIC score. Since the score obtained in the sanitation module is ultimately&#13;

                                                                                                  Private Limited&#13;
                                                                             'l'lltlli SllllllWI!II l::iilil&amp;llltill!l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 being plugged into the overall score-card for water and sanitation, it was felt that there&#13;
 was no point in duplicating their measurement in this system also. However, this will mean&#13;
 that if there is no integrated delivery, then these factors will not be evaluated at all. This&#13;
 will not be totally reflective of the project's performance. Nevertheless, at present, there is&#13;
 no move to include these indicators for the areas where there is no integrated delivery,&#13;
 simply because the best scenario is integrated delivery and a PIC which does not&#13;
 measure these integrated service delivery indicators will show a poorer overall score. This&#13;
 will impress upon the concerned authorities the urgency of integrating the delivery of&#13;
 services if they are really serious about the sustainability of the project.&#13;
&#13;
 Secondly, the structure and management costs of administering this module are also not&#13;
 separately catered for, as it is assumed that the infrastructure, hardware, personnel and&#13;
 other resources used for/by it, will be the same as those being employed for the&#13;
 administration of the Swajaldhara M &amp; E system. Therefore, while the indicators of this&#13;
 Sanitation module are different, in keeping with it's principles, objectives, guidelines and&#13;
 components, it will be to a very large extent, based on the Swajaldhara pattern of M &amp; E,&#13;
 because both the projects have the underlying fundamental principles of being reform&#13;
 initiatives which are 'people-centered' and 'community-led'.&#13;

              of cost-effective and appropriate technological options to the community and&#13;
              demonstrating their affordability to them, will be crucial to their wholehearted&#13;
              adoption of this programme.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Establishment of RSMs/PCs is expected to increase availability of material,&#13;
              services and guidance needed for construction of sanitary assets. This would&#13;
              result in increasing sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     The success of a programme is measured by it's ability to cover all sections of&#13;
              society, especially the disadvantaged groups like women, children, SC/ST, BPL,&#13;
              disabled, senior citizens etc. Privacy and accessibility for certain groups like the&#13;
              girls, women and the old are necessary if usage is to be promoted and the&#13;
              facilities are to be rendered sustainable. The project guidelines clearly state that&#13;
              separate sanitation facilities should be provided for boys and girls in schools.&#13;
              There have to be well coordinated and planned efforts at all levels in order to&#13;
              make the use of sanitation facilities in schools a universal and regular practice.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     In order to ensure sustainable health and hygiene benefits, it is essential that the&#13;
              targeted sanitary latrines (both individual and community) are not only completed&#13;
              but are also used on a daily basis.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     In a project in which further installments are to be released only when a certain&#13;
              amount of the previous installment has been expended, the percentage of&#13;
              expenditure has to be monitored regularly, in order to know when the project&#13;
              qualifies for the next installment. Appropriate and planned expenditure of funds&#13;
              received will be reflected in the timely achievement of project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Integration of water and sanitation is essential to the sustainability of the project&#13;
              and for the impact of health and hygiene to be really felt. Sanitary facilities which&#13;
              do not have water easily available will not be used regularly.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Regular repair and maintenance of both individual and community sanitation&#13;
              facilities is necessary for their continued usage and sustainability. Local&#13;
              technicians would be preferred for this as they would be easily accessible.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Coverage of the target households and population as planned is crucial for the&#13;
              enhancement of sanitation coverage as stated in the project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;¢     Selection of capable and suitable Government and non-government bodies for&#13;
              carrying selected project tasks will ensure the stakeholders are mobilized and&#13;
              informed in a manner that will equip them to plan, implement and operate their&#13;
              project in a collective manner.&#13;

&#13;
        â&#128;¢     One of the major incentives at all levels in the TSC project is the Nirmal Gram&#13;
              Puraskar (NGP) which is awarded on the fulfillment of certain rather stringent&#13;
              conditions one of which is the declaration of the project area 'open defecation&#13;
              free'. Keeping the village environment clean is one of the eligibility conditions of&#13;
              the NGP. The only way to achieve this is to see that the village drains and lanes&#13;
              are clean, there is no stagnant pool of water around water points and proper&#13;
              disposal of garbage and cow-dung is done.&#13;
&#13;
 2.3 Key assumptions&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢      Swajaldhara was designed as a modular system so that it can accommodate&#13;
              multiple thematic plug-ins subsequently. It is understood that these plug-ins would&#13;
              be based on the same overall structure proposed for Swajaldhara but would vary&#13;
              in terms of indicators and related basic data. Based upon the core Swajaldhara&#13;
              module, the other thematic modules envisaged are:&#13;
             o   Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC)&#13;
&#13;
             o   Hygiene and Health&#13;
&#13;
             o   Water Quality Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
             o   Water Conservation Measures&#13;
       â&#128;¢      TSC represents the first thematic module of the overall M&amp;E system and builds&#13;
              upon the foundation provided by the Swajaldhara M&amp;E system design. In view of&#13;
              this approach, the overall structure of TSC is the same as Swajaldhara. This&#13;
              means that not only are the components of TSC the same as Swajaldhara, but&#13;
              that the flow of data and organization of information in the computer based MIS&#13;
              also follows a similar pattern as the Swajaldhara core module.&#13;
&#13;
 2.4 Deviations from Swajaldhara MIS&#13;
&#13;
 Although the basic design remains the same as Swajaldhara, certain deviations have been&#13;
 necessitated due to inherent differences in the program structures of both the programs.&#13;
       i.    No baseline data is available either at village or at habitation level, for the country&#13;
             as a whole. However, since the TSC M&amp;E module design is based upon the&#13;
             Swajaldhara M&amp;E design, provision would be made for entering the baseline data&#13;
             at the district level, as and when available. This would be done based upon the&#13;
             format given in Format HAB-16 of Annex 1-C.&#13;

        ii.    In Swajaldhara the schemes are generally designed and formulated at the&#13;
               habitation level, whereas in TSC the entire villa~e (covering all habitations of the&#13;
               village) is the unit for scheme formulation and design.&#13;
&#13;
        iii.   There are two sources of funds at the district level - one from the State and the&#13;
               other directly from Go I.&#13;
&#13;
        iv.    In Swajaldhara the expenses incurred during the month were being captured&#13;
               under the categories of hardware, software and administrative expenses, while in&#13;
               TSC, expenses against each of the items i.e. IHHLs, CSCs, SSLs/ AWLs - BWLs,&#13;
               Start-up, IEC and Administration, are being captured and subsequently reflected&#13;
               in various reports. This is as per the requirements reflected in the guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
        v.     One of the key components of TSC is its emphasis towards 'Nirmal Gram&#13;
               Puraskar' as a motivator for better implementation. Keeping this in view suitable&#13;
               indicators at the village level have been devised so that the eligibility of an&#13;
               individual village/scheme for Nirmal Gram Puraskar can be determined. At the&#13;
               district level, information is captured through input formats regarding qualification&#13;
               of villages (GPs), blocks, individuals, and NGOs as well as qualification of the&#13;
               entire district for Nirmal Gram Puraskar.&#13;
&#13;
        vi.    Since there is no formal mechanism for collection of community funds during the&#13;
               O&amp;M phase, data capture during this phase has been limited to information on&#13;
               assets only.&#13;
 2.5 Scoring Pattern&#13;
&#13;
 There are a total of 27 MIS indicators distributed over three levels of the project - Village,&#13;
 District and State (See Annexure 1.8), on the basis of which data will be collected. In the MIS&#13;
 indicator tables it has been indicated as to how the data would be represented i.e. Yes (Y)/&#13;
 No (N), date or percentage(%). The type of indicator is mentioned i.e. process (Pr), physical&#13;
 progress (PP) and financial progress (FP). The means of verification is reflected in the type of&#13;
 input format given against each indicator in the table and the periodicity of collection can be&#13;
 inferred from the type of Input Form to be used to record the information. The phase during&#13;
 which the information should be gathered i.e. Pre-planning (PP), Planning (P),&#13;
 Implementation (I) or Operation &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) is referred to. In the last column the&#13;
 maximum marks that may be scored with regard to each field /indicator is shown.&#13;
&#13;
 The maximum score of the village level indicators is 250 for process (Pr) indicators, 125 for&#13;
 financial progress (FP) indicators and 125 for physical progress (PP) indicators, making it a&#13;
 total of 500 for quantitative indicators at this level. The phase-wise break-up of marks is such&#13;
 that the scores for all the process indicators pertaining to the Pre-Planning, Planning and&#13;
 Implementation Phases total up to 150 and the scores for the O&amp;M Phase indicators total up&#13;

&#13;
 to 100. At the district and state levels, the maximum quantitative score is 500 each. The&#13;
 quantitative scores obtained will then be combined with the qualitative scores which will then&#13;
 be tabulated together to inform the Performance Index Card system by which each project&#13;
 village, district and state can be rated. The combined score-sheet can be viewed in table in&#13;
 the Chapter 4- "Integration Mechanism".&#13;
&#13;
 2.6 Supporting technology option&#13;
&#13;
 The~  M &amp; E system proposed for TSC is to be used in an integrated manner along with the&#13;
 Swajaldhara module as a plugged-in component of the same. Hence, it will be utilizing the&#13;
 existing infrastructure for which the supporting technology is web-based. This makes&#13;
 information accessible anywhere at anytime by every body, but this mode of M &amp; E is heavily&#13;
 dependent on the communication infrastructure status, which may have to be upgraded for&#13;
 the purpose in some cases. The web based system would ensure that information is captured&#13;
 in nearly real-time and is made available to users I stakeholders (depending on their user&#13;
 access rights) at all levels. Such a system would also allow RGNDWM to instantly access&#13;
 and analyze up-to-date information from all the states.&#13;
&#13;
 In this web-based approach both the application and the databases will be physically hosted&#13;
 on a server within RGNDWM. The entire data will be maintained within the centralized&#13;
 databases, but the access to data will be controlled using a filling mechanism, which will&#13;
 ensure that individual states will not only have complete control over the data but will also be&#13;
 protected from possible misuse or inadvertent disruption due to problems caused by other&#13;
 states. Thus states will retain ownership and full control over their data segment.&#13;
                              I&#13;
 2.Ei.1 Systems Requirem~hts and Specifications (SRS)&#13;
&#13;
 Based on the overall project design, a revised Systems Requirements and Specifications&#13;
 (SIRS) document was prepared. The SRS document was prepared keeping in view the&#13;
 computerised-MIS definition and expectations. It clearly defines each essential component&#13;
 required for design and development of the computerised-MIS. The SRS is like a blue print of&#13;
 the software solution being developed and gives the future managers the possibility to&#13;
 understand how the computerised MIS is conceived and developed. The SRS is being made&#13;
 available as a separate document, complementary to this one, and forms an integral part of&#13;
 the M&amp;E system design documentation package.&#13;
&#13;
 The core project database relates to other external datasets and users {through input and&#13;
 output formats). It would comprise of the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢      Database Structure&#13;
 Data for the Computerized MIS can be classified as 'External Data' (available as Census and&#13;
 Habitation survey), 'Internal Data' (data related to system used, and support data for user&#13;

  lists), and 'Project Data' (data collected at Scheme, District, State and National levels). This&#13;
  data will then be processed to deliver the desired reports. The database design is&#13;
  characterized by two types of tables, namely:&#13;
        1.     Master Table (one time entry), and&#13;
        2.     Transaction Table (providing for regular updates) to capture and maintain all the&#13;
               data.&#13;

&#13;
 Direct data entry in the computerized M &amp; E System will be done through data entry forms&#13;
 provided by the system. These can broadly be classified as:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     1.        Input forms for Internal Data, and&#13;
     2.        Input forms for Project Data set.&#13;

&#13;
 (Note: External data as collected through Census and Habitation Survey datasets can be&#13;
 uploaded directly into master table, if available, without any manual data entry)&#13;
&#13;
 Data classified, as Internal data will be manually entered through data entry screens. This&#13;
 consists of data related to system users (like user details, passwords etc.) and support data&#13;
 for user lists (e.g. Levels, Phases, Groups, Themes, Indicators) that facilitate data entry for&#13;
 the Project Data Set. Data collected at Scheme, Districts, State and National level is through&#13;
 hard copy (paper) forms identified for each of these levels at defined frequencies (one-time or&#13;
 monthly). This can be entered into the computerized MIS using data entry screens that will be&#13;
 provided by the MIS.&#13;

 It may be noted here that the computerised MIS will automatically generate the RGNDWM&#13;

 In addition to using the above-standardised formats, the user would also have the freedom to&#13;
 query the database directly for any specific information s/he may require during the course of&#13;

      3         Qualitative Window&#13;
&#13;
  The qualitative aspects of TSC will be monitored and evaluated mainly through the periodic&#13;
  reviews to be commissioned by SWSM and DWSMs and Community Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
  (CM&amp;E) system.&#13;
&#13;
  Qualitative aspects would have 250 quality points, which will be based on the periodic review&#13;
  and community monitoring systems. However, the Village PIC will be based on 500 marks&#13;
  from quantitative window and 250 marks from community monitoring. The marks obtained&#13;
  both on periodic review and community monitoring would be instrumental in determining the&#13;
  PIC of the District and the State, along with the quantitative score.&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Periodic Review&#13;
&#13;
  Periodic reviews will be commissioned with the prime objective of assessing the quality of&#13;
  processes and outcomes. It is expected that a team of multidisciplinary professionals having&#13;
  a sound understanding of sanitation and hygiene behaviour would be fielded for undertaking&#13;
  these periodic reviews. The RGNDWM would commission the state reviews of TSC and the&#13;
  SWSM would carry out the review of TSC Districts.&#13;
&#13;
  In States and Districts where Swajaldhara and TSC projects are being managed jointly at&#13;
  State and District levels by the SWSMs and DWSMs respectively. Ideally the same team&#13;
  should be carrying out both kinds of reviews simultaneously. It is envisaged that there will be&#13;
  integrated delivery of water and sanitation by the SWSM and the overall supervision of the&#13;
  project will have to be conducted at the state level along with the SWSM. Hence, the M&amp;E&#13;
  module has catered to this and built in a Periodic Review of State functions also into the&#13;
  design. Therefore, the management structure and the costs involved for conducting the&#13;
  Periodic Reviews, will not be duplicated and the exercise will prove economical.&#13;
&#13;
  However, where the TSC is being managed independently of Swajaldhara, the costs will&#13;
  have to be booked under the Administrative component of the project, which amounts to&#13;
  below 5% of the total outlay, out of which 80% will be borne by the Gol and 20% by the&#13;
  concerned State Govt. The amount available in each district will be different depending on&#13;
  the total amount sanctioned for the d.istrict. Other guidelines, procedures and conditions for&#13;
  the reviews will remain the same as\ those followed by the Swajaldhara M&amp;E design as&#13;
  outlined below.&#13;
&#13;
  Periodic reviews will be undertaken on an annual basis based on an agreed set of issues and&#13;
  indicators and would feed their findings to Districts and State, as the case may be. The&#13;

periodic review team will also suggest a set of actions, which require immediate attention at&#13;
the project end.&#13;
&#13;
The Review commissioned by SWSM will be undertaken in three to five select villages of the&#13;
district on an agreed set of issues and forn)ats. However, the review team will have the liberty&#13;
to expand the scope depending on the local situation and in consultation with the VWSCs.&#13;
The review team will share the findings and submit action report for action in the village and&#13;
at the DWSM level.&#13;
&#13;
The Periodic Review commissioned by RGNDWM will be undertaken in 3 sample villages of&#13;
two sample districts, along with review of district functions and plan. The review report will be&#13;
shared with the Chairman SWSM and actions agreed will be indicated in the review report.&#13;
Follow up action on the agreed actions would also qualify for marks in the subsequent&#13;
reviews.&#13;
&#13;
Qualitative aspect would have 250 quality points, which will be based on the periodic review&#13;
and community monitoring system. The marks obtained in the Periodic Review&#13;
commissioned by RGNDWM will be utilized for determining the PIC of the State and the&#13;
marks obtained in the Periodic Review commissioned by SWSM will be utilized for&#13;
determining the PIC of the District.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.1 !Periodic Review Procedure&#13;
&#13;
Stepsâ&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
Before undertaking any review mission, the review teams, both at RGNDWM and State&#13;
levels, would be provided with the latest set of available documentation concerning the state,&#13;
district and schemes to be visited, i.e.:&#13;
&#13;
         the last Periodic Review reports of the state/district(s),&#13;
&#13;
         the latest Monthly Progress report of the district(s),&#13;
&#13;
         the latest Scheme profiles and Inland Letters of the scheme(s).&#13;
&#13;
The periodic review of project districts would be carried out by multi-disciplinary teams&#13;
formE!d by SWSM and would have the following steps:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Interaction with key project managers and functionaries at the district level,&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Selection of villages to be visited through a purposive random sampling method,&#13;

     â&#128;¢   Wrap-up discussion at the district level,&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Preparation of a review report and its submission to SWSM with copy to ZP/DWSC.&#13;
&#13;
 The interaction with key project managers and functionaries at the district level would begin&#13;
 with setting the agenda for the proposed field investigations at the village level including the&#13;
 selection of villages to be visited. However, the main focus of the interactions has to be on&#13;
 getting to know the qualitative dimensions of the programme implementation, particularly the&#13;
 aspects of efforts at generating demand and creating an enabling environment, promotion of&#13;
 appropriate and cost-effective technology and an alternative delivery mechanism,&#13;
 functionality, access and privacy of sanitation facilities and the usage, maintenance and&#13;
 sustainability of sanitation assets created.&#13;
&#13;
 The field assessment at the village level would aim at mapping out the quality of progress&#13;
 made in achieving the realization of project objectives both in terms of the processes involved&#13;
 and outcomes achieved. The focus would be on assessing the effectiveness of the efforts&#13;
 made to generate demand in terms of the community's response to the IEC and motivational&#13;
 activities conducted, facilitating the informed community choice of technological options and&#13;
 the functionality and usage patterns of both individual and community sanitation facilities and&#13;
 the 0 &amp; M arrangements made for them.&#13;
&#13;
 The review team shall visit at least one village in each of the three phases, i.e. planning,&#13;
 implementation and O&amp;M. In case of new TSC Project districts, where project villages have&#13;
 yet to be undertaken, the review exercise would be limited to the district review only. In case&#13;
 of districts, where the villages are in the planning or implementation phases only, all the&#13;
 villages to be selected for the field-based review would obviously be taken from these phases&#13;
 only.&#13;
&#13;
 The field assessments would be followed up by a wrap-up discussion at the district level,&#13;
 leading to the preparation of an action plan agreed to be put into action before the next&#13;
 review. In case of a felt need, an interaction with stakeholders at the state level would also be&#13;
 held to discuss and sort out required policy and other issues.&#13;
&#13;
 Similarly, the periodic review of states would be carried out by multi-disciplinary teams&#13;
 formed by RGNDWM and would have the following steps:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Interaction with key functionaries at the SWSM,&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Selection of districts to be reviewed through a purposive random sampling method,&#13;

          SWSM.&#13;
&#13;
  Revi1ew type and Periodicity&#13;
&#13;
 The periodic reviews shall be of two types, review of project districts by SWSM and project&#13;
 states by RGNDWM. Both the reviews would be carried out by multi-disciplinary teams&#13;
 formed at respective levels for the purpose.&#13;
&#13;
 For review of districts within a state, it would be the responsibility of the concerned SWSM to&#13;
 form a multi-disciplinary team of experts from within the resources available in the state. One&#13;
 way of doing this could be to have selected members of a core group, i.e. a multi-disciplinary&#13;
 team of professionals engaged in planning and management of TSC Project in a district, as&#13;
 members of the review team in districts other than their own. This would indeed indirectly&#13;
 promote cross-learning between districts and foster a spirit of competition. The SWSM would&#13;
 ensure that all the project districts are reviewed at least once in a year.&#13;
&#13;
 Similarly, review of participating states would be carried out by RGNDWM at least once in a&#13;
 year in every participating state. The purpose of this review would be to assess the overall&#13;
 reform orientation of the state as per the reform principles inherent in TSC Project Guidelines.&#13;
 This again has to be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of professionals, selected&#13;
 care!fully for their outstanding experience and insight in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
 The aggregated scores achieved in the periodic review of districts by SWSM would be&#13;
 entered in the District PIC. Similarly, scores achieved in periodic reviews commissioned by&#13;
 RGNDWM for States would be entered in the respective State PIC.&#13;
&#13;
 Duration&#13;
&#13;
 The review exercise in case of state reviews would be of 8 days duration including 1 day at&#13;
 the state level, 1 day each at two districts (one old TSC district and one new TSC district), 2&#13;
 days each at the village level in both the districts and 1 day for wrap-up discussion at the&#13;
 district/state levels as per requirement. The district level review is proposed to be of duration&#13;
 of 5 days excluding the travel time. The first day would be for interaction with project&#13;
 functionaries and stakeholders at the district level. The following three days would be&#13;
 declicated to field assessments and related debriefing. The fifth day would be spent in&#13;
 interactions at the district and state levels as per the review requirements.&#13;

 Composition of Review Team&#13;
&#13;
 The periodic review team formed for reviewing states' performance would comprise of a&#13;
 minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 members chosen by RGNDWM from among the panel of&#13;
 professionals prepared for the purpose. However, the team members to be inducted in the&#13;
 team locally would be besides the team constituted for the purpose by RGNDWM. It would be&#13;
 desirable that the local review teams for different project districts are decided well in advance&#13;
 and confirmation of the concerned team members are also obtained. The specialists in the&#13;
 review team shall include:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Social scientist with experience in community driven rural water and sanitation&#13;
         management,&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Sanitation engineer with experience in community driven rural water and sanitation&#13;
         management,&#13;
     (One of the above two professionals, could also act as Team Leader)&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Environmental sanitation specialist also well versed with solid waste management&#13;
         issues.&#13;
&#13;
 Besides, following three members from the district to be evaluated would also be included in&#13;
 the review team:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   One social scientist from core group,&#13;
     â&#128;¢   One sanitation engineer from core group,&#13;
     â&#128;¢   One environmental sanitation specialist from core group.&#13;
&#13;
 The basic intent of including them in the review team is to ensure transparency in the review&#13;
 process and promote involvement and ownership of the stakeholders in the review exercise&#13;
 at the local level. However, these members would not have the right of assigning scores on&#13;
 review so as to keep the review process free from biases.&#13;
&#13;
 Similarly, two or three VWSC/community members should also be chosen on the spot in&#13;
 consultation with the community at the time of conducting a review at the village level.&#13;
&#13;
 The periodic review team formed by SWSM would comprise primarily of the members of the&#13;
 core group, i.e. a multi-disciplinary team of professionals engaged in planning and&#13;
 management of TSC Project at the district level. However, the team could also have&#13;
 members drawn from other agencies such as support organizations engaged in TSC Project&#13;
 implementation. Two or three VWSC/community members should also be chosen and&#13;
 inducted in the team on the spot in consultation with the community at the time of conducting&#13;
 a review at the village level.&#13;

 Estimated Cost&#13;
&#13;
 The unit costs of district and state periodic reviews have been worked out and are presented&#13;
 in Annexure V. However, it is assumed that the RGNDWM, SWSMs and DWSMs will send&#13;
 Periodic Review Missions for the Swajaldhara and TSC Projects jointly, so these costs are&#13;
 only attached for reference.&#13;
&#13;
 3.1.:! Outcomes to be reviewed: Programme qualitative assessment&#13;
&#13;
 Periodic review of a state by RGNDWM would involve review at state level, at district level in&#13;
 randomly selected TSC (old) and TSC (new) districts (at least one each) and village levels (at&#13;
 least one each in planning, implementation and O&amp;M phases). Similarly, periodic review of a&#13;
 district by SWSM would involve review at district level and village levels (at least one each in&#13;
 planning, implementation and O&amp;M phases).&#13;
&#13;
The outcomes to be reviewed at various levels and related contributing factors have been&#13;
listed in the table below. The multi-disciplinary teams constituted by RGNDWM and SWSM&#13;
for the purpose of periodic review exercise would keep these in view during the course of&#13;
reviE~W as per the requirements of the level of review.&#13;
&#13;

 â&#128;¢     Linkage with Benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
As evident from the above description, the programme qualitative assessment is being&#13;
carried out in the four benchmark categories. This is being done to capture the qualitative&#13;
aspects of the related indicators, the quantitative information about which is already being&#13;
obtained through the computerised MIS.&#13;
&#13;
The numerical value of each benchmark category would be worked out on the basis of actual&#13;
percentage being achieved against each benchmark, as per the data available in the&#13;
computerised MIS.&#13;
&#13;
The qualitative aspects of benchmarks would be assessed through state periodic review&#13;
commissioned by RGNDWM. Benchmarks have been determined under four major&#13;
categories. Each benchmark category would be assigned an actual value to assess the&#13;
performance of state against benchmarks. The benchmark categories comprise of issues,&#13;
which are directly related to the qualitative aspects of benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The scores obtained by states on the benchmark categories will be compared with the&#13;
determined benchmark values. The final benchmark value will be ascertained by taking&#13;
average percentage of values scored in respect of benchmark categories through computer&#13;
based MIS and periodic review. The section relating to benchmarks can be viewed in&#13;

3.2    Community Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (C-M&amp;E) System&#13;
&#13;
3.2.1 Purpose&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of C-M&amp;E is to institutionalise the process of concurrent learning and action&#13;
regarding TSC project planning and management at the community level. A participatory&#13;
community monitoring system would empower the user communities by upgrading their&#13;
organisational and management skills. This would also generate a wealth of data, which&#13;
besides being used by the community for their own purposes would also inform project&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
The C-M&amp;E tools are essentially designed to promote interactive and experiential learning.&#13;
They can also be used both by the literate and illiterate segments of the community equally&#13;
effectively irrespective of their gender and class characteristics. However, the community&#13;
capacity building and initial hand holding by the support agency and their community&#13;
facilitators are of critical importance in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
By employing these tools as a plan drawn by the community, they can see where they have&#13;
succeeded and where they have fallen short and then take appropriate measures to remedy&#13;
the situation. It is also the best way for communities to gauge their status vis-a-vis their&#13;

 project objectives and the targets, which they themselves have set in the Community Action&#13;
 Plan. Through this process communities themselves generate and use knowledge to solve&#13;
 their own problems, which is fundamental to the sustainability of the sanitation facilities&#13;
 installed and the resulting changes in health and hygiene behaviours and practices. It adds&#13;
 owne!rship to findings and commitment to action.&#13;
&#13;
 3.2.2 Establishing the C-M&amp;E System&#13;
&#13;
 i)    Community Monitoring Issues and Methodology: The process of identification of key&#13;
       issues and indicators amongst communities, which they will then monitor on their own,&#13;
       would be a crucial one. This will have to be done through a process of consultation with&#13;
       VWSC and users. However, for the purposes of this M&amp;E design, a set of key issues&#13;
       have already been arrived at and may be viewed in table 3.8. These may be&#13;
       subsequently modified by each concerned community to suit their particular conditions,&#13;
       as long as the main elements of the benefits/ sustainability of a sanitation project are&#13;
       retained.&#13;
&#13;
       For the purposes of convenience, regarding the time-line dimension of the project, the&#13;
       issues and indicators to be monitored by the community, are being categorized&#13;
       according to the Planning, Implementation and O&amp;M phases. In the planning phase,&#13;
       they will focus on whether the community members are motivated enough to construct&#13;
       sanitary facilities, their informed choice of sanitation technology and sites for the&#13;
       facilities and the quality of the capacity-building and other facilitative activities of the&#13;
       selected NGO. The issues that require monitoring in the Implementation Phase mainly&#13;
       center around construction activities, their proper supervision by the community and the&#13;
       resulting quality. In the O&amp;M Phase, the community will be concerned about the&#13;
       functionality and maintenance of both the individual and community sanitation assets&#13;
       created in their village, as these would be the factors behind the sustainability of the&#13;
       assets created.&#13;
&#13;
       Community Monitoring Group: In order to make the C-M&amp;E work as intended, it&#13;
       would be imperative to have a representative and dedicated group to undertake all the&#13;
       related activities on a regular basis. Hence, it is proposed to have a Community&#13;
       Monitoring Group (CMG) constituted of the selected members of the community, who&#13;
       would be working on behalf of the community members in a participatory and&#13;
       transparent manner. The CMG would be required to function under the overall guidance&#13;
       and supervision of the VWSC. However, the members of the CMG would have to be&#13;
       representative of the users and would not consist only of VWSC members.&#13;
&#13;
       The main role of the CMG in the TSC framework would be one of bringing community&#13;
       cohesiveness on issues related to sanitation in the village. This would be done by&#13;
       bringing different groups and actors on a common platform, whl_yh could include Gram&#13;

      Panchayat (GP), Parent Teacher Association (PTA), households etc. It would also be&#13;
      useful to involve community based organisations such as Mahila Mandals, Yuvak&#13;
      Mandals, Self-Help Groups or any other local bodies in community monitoring activities.&#13;
&#13;
      The CMG would endeavour to bring individual I institutional initiatives under an overall&#13;
      decision-making process of a collective nature, and thereby individual I institutional&#13;
      actions into a consistent community action plan including environmental sanitation,&#13;
      community sanitary complexes, school sanitary latrines, Anganwadi latrines, Balwadi&#13;
      latrines and individual household latrines.&#13;
&#13;
      The CMG, which should not comprise of more than 6 members, must also necessarily&#13;
      have members from the socially vulnerable groups like senior citizens, women, children&#13;
      and from the BPL and the SCIST households, so that there is an equitable&#13;
      representation of these segments in the group and their concerns are also voiced by&#13;
      their own representatives. This group would undertake community-monitoring exercises&#13;
      through use of tools and aids being developed for the purpose and they will be trained&#13;
      on conducting monitoring activities and use of tools for gathering information. After&#13;
      conducting each exercise, they would submit their assessment report to the VWSC for&#13;
      action and follow up.&#13;
&#13;
ii)   Community Monitoring Indicators: Here again, the exercise of identifying the CM&amp;E&#13;
      indicators will be the task of the VWSC and the community members, as they are the&#13;
      best judge of what they would like to measure for the sustainability of their own&#13;
      sanitation project. These indicators are to be arrived at, keeping in view the issues&#13;
      which need monitoring at the community level. They will have to be simple, easy to&#13;
      measure and should not involve too much paper work and time, or the system will not&#13;
      be adhered to. A suggestive list of indicators is given in the table below:&#13;

 iii)   Capacity Building for community monitoring: The CMG members will be new to the&#13;
        task of Community Monitoring and they would need to be trained in the use of various&#13;
        tools and methods developed for the purpose. Corrective actions will have to be taken&#13;
        in a timely fashion in order for them to continue to realize the benefits of the project. As&#13;
        the members would vary in terms of their respective backgrounds including age,&#13;
        educational level and capacity, the training will have to be designed and conducted&#13;
        keeping these differences in mind. The facilitating agencies and NGOs at the district&#13;
        and community level will also have to be trained to undertake this task of building the&#13;
        capacities of the CMGs.&#13;
&#13;
 iv)    Information Flow and Feedback to the Community: The information flow between&#13;
        the community and the project management is designed to be two-way. The&#13;
        mechanism to activate this arrangement is there in the form of pre-printed inland letters&#13;
        to be sent by the community to the project management in each phase and feedback&#13;
        reports to be sent to the community by the project management. The details are&#13;
        outlined below in point no. 3.2.4.&#13;

 3.2.4 linkage with project Management&#13;
&#13;
 Communities would send their findings /response on these issues through a pre-printed&#13;
 inland letter. These inland letters will have mainly YES/NO type objective questions.&#13;
 HoWiever, some space would also be provided in the inland letter to write in brief on any issue&#13;
 of concern regarding sanitation. It will be the onus of the DWSM-Core Group to scrutinize and&#13;
 analyse the responses and provide feedback. A standard feedback form is also suggested&#13;
 which may be employed by the Core Group for sending their feedback to the community&#13;
 concerned. The Inland letter Formats and the Feedback Report Formats can be viewed&#13;
 in Annexures Ill A &amp; B.&#13;
&#13;
 3.2.!i linkage with Computerised MIS&#13;
&#13;
 The linkages of the community monitoring system with the computerised MIS are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     In planning, implementation and O&amp;M phases, marks against some information&#13;
       received through inland letters, particularly related to user satisfaction, would be&#13;
       entered into the computerized system and shall form a part of the scheme level PIC.&#13;
       During the O&amp;M phase, the information on the indicators would be available through&#13;
       inland letter system only.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     A part of the information (received through inland letters from community) would not be&#13;
       entered in computerized MIS so as to avoid unnecessary data overload on the system.&#13;
       The information, not to be entered in the computerized MIS, is meant for use directly by&#13;
       field coordinators and other district level programme managers for identifying gaps and&#13;
       taking suitable timely action for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     Feedback reports - to increase transparency and provide the community with some&#13;
       access to the computerized MIS&#13;

&#13;
4.1   Performance Index Card&#13;
&#13;
4.1.1 Purpose&#13;
&#13;
The Performance Index Card (PIC) mechanism has been built in into the system with the&#13;
purpose of assessing performance of villages, districts and states, as also to make a&#13;
comparative evaluation of their performance across all these levels. It is expected that it&#13;
would result in healthy competition and exchange of best practices and knowledge on key&#13;
performance issues.&#13;
&#13;
The PIC would take into account both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of&#13;
performance. While the quantitative performance would be assessed on the basis of marks&#13;
obtained against fulfillment of each indicator, qualitative performance would be considered&#13;
based on periodic review scores and performance against community monitoring system.&#13;
The computerised MIS would generate three sets of PIC for village/scheme, district and state&#13;
respectively. The State PIC and District PIC would be based on performance against key&#13;
process and progress indicators and marks obtained in periodic review and community&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. Village/ Scheme level PIC would be based on scores obtained&#13;
against key indicators and community monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
4.1.2 Key features&#13;
&#13;
The quantitative component of District PIC would have 80% village performance and 20%&#13;
district performance. This latter 20% comprises of 10% marks based on the District MIS&#13;
indicators and the remaining 10% in the form of a bonus for qualifying for the Nirmal Gram&#13;
Puraskar. The qualitative component of the District PIC would comprise 20% of performance&#13;
against C-M&amp;E and 80% on performance against periodic review. The quantitative&#13;
component of State PIC would comprise of 80% based on district and village performance&#13;
and 20% on state performance. The qualitative aspect would comprise of 4% of performance&#13;
against C-M&amp;E and 16% against district periodic review and 80% of performance in the state&#13;
periodic review.&#13;

TSC is based on some fundamental principles, which in the course of their operationalization&#13;
invariably involve certain critical functions. These critical functions are to be followed across&#13;
all the project districts. A set of indicators has been evolved to monitor the process and&#13;
progress of these functions. These are proposed to be termed as 'sanitation performance&#13;
indicators'.&#13;
&#13;
The scores obtained in the PIGs by the TSC project states, districts and villages will in turn be&#13;
plugned into the Swajaldhara M &amp; E module PIC, which is designed to reflect the&#13;
performance of other initiatives like sanitation, hygiene and health, water resources&#13;
management and water quality monitoring, once all these concomitant M &amp; E modules are&#13;
developed.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Qualitative component: Evaluation system&#13;
&#13;
Field-based Periodic Review&#13;
&#13;
Periodic review would essentially be an exercise in evaluation, learning and action. The&#13;
primary purpose of periodic review is to make a qualitative assessment of the process and&#13;
outcomes of TSC projects.&#13;
&#13;
The detailed methodology of carrying out periodic review exercise including steps involved,&#13;
duration, periodicity, outcomes to be reviewed and associated contributing factors, methods&#13;
and tools, review and reporting formats etc., has been developed by the consultants.&#13;
&#13;
The periodic review of states and districts would be carried out by RGNDWM and SWSM&#13;
respectively by forming multi-disciplinary teams drawn from a panel of experts drawn at their&#13;
level. These would be carried out once a year. The basic purpose of this exercise would be to&#13;
identify areas of weaknesses and plan and undertake required corrective measures, as also&#13;
to work out areas of required policy and capacity building support to project districts as per&#13;
their specific requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Community M&amp;E&#13;
&#13;
In case of village/scheme PIC, the qualitative component would comprise of information&#13;
received through community monitoring and evaluation in the form of inland letters, in place&#13;
of periodic reviews.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Scoring mechanism&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned in the tables above, in the TSC module, the PIC of each state, district and&#13;
village would have a maximum total of 750 marks, out of which 500 will be based on the&#13;
quantitative computerized MIS indicators and 250 marks are allocated to the qualitative&#13;
aspects of periodic review (at the state and district levels) and the community monitoring&#13;

 available in Annexure 1-D.&#13;
&#13;
 4.1.3 Scores of computerized MIS&#13;
&#13;
 Village/Scheme level&#13;
&#13;
 The quantitative MIS indicators at the village level have been distributed in the following&#13;
 manner:&#13;
&#13;
          Table 4.4: Marking pattern of sanitation indicators at the village/scheme level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
As is evident from the above marking pattern, the combined total of the physical and financial&#13;
progress indicators together carry equal weightage as compared to the total of process&#13;
indicators. The underlying reason of proposing this pattern is to avoid bias and distortion in&#13;
fair and objective evaluation by way of striking a balance between quantum and quality of&#13;
effort made.&#13;

&#13;
The phase-wise break-up of marks is such that the scores for all the process indicators&#13;
pertaining to the Pre-Planning, Planning and Implementation Phases total up to 150 and the&#13;
scores for the O&amp;M Phase indicators total up to 100. The ratio of weightage for the process&#13;
indicators related to O&amp;M phase and those related to pre-planning, planning and&#13;
implementation phases together have been taken as 40:60, in order to accord slightly higher&#13;
weightage to community ownership and O&amp;M of assets created, which is the very basis of the&#13;
reform agenda.&#13;
&#13;
The sanitation indicators as developed broadly relate to three levels, namely village/scheme,&#13;
district and state. Whereas the state level process indicators shall directly get aggregated into&#13;
the computerized MIS, the system would have an in-built mechanism for calculating average&#13;
of each district and village level indicators as against the total number of districts and villages&#13;
applicable for the same respectively. The financial progress indicators shall be aggregated&#13;

 The total district level quantitative score of 500 would comprise of 100 marks on district&#13;
 performance, out of which 50 marks will be based on the district MIS indicators and 50 marks&#13;
 will be based on the bonus received with regard to their performance vis-a-vis the Nirmal&#13;
 Gram Puraskar. The other 400 marks will be derived from the performance of villages in the&#13;
 quantitative indicators. Thus, 80 % of the total quantitative score at the district level is based&#13;
 on village performance.&#13;
&#13;
 The 250 marks which have been allocated to the district qualitative window will be distributed&#13;
 in the following manner: 200 marks will be allotted for the district's performance in the&#13;
 Periodic Review commissioned by the SWSM and 50 marks will be based on the marks&#13;
 obtained by the village in the C-M&amp;E System.&#13;

 The total state level quantitative score of 500 would comprise of 100 marks of state&#13;

 marks on the basis of district indicators, 40 marks on the basis of bonus marks obtained by&#13;
 villa!~es for Nirmal Gram Puraskar and 320 marks from the village level performance in the&#13;
 quantitative MIS indicators. Here again 80 % of the total quantitative score at the state level is&#13;

&#13;
      With regard to the TSC project, the comparison of the performance of villages/schemes,&#13;
      districts and states would be made on the basis of scores achieved by the districts and&#13;
      states, against the total marks of 750 distributed between the quantitative and qualitative&#13;
      windows of the respective village/scheme, district and state PICs. However, the overall score&#13;
      across all the dimensions to be covered under the Swajaldhara module (see table 4.1) will&#13;
      not be obtained till the M &amp; E modules for all the other initiatives are also developed. A joint&#13;
      PIC for water and sanitation can be obtained (see table 4.2) for the states, districts and&#13;
      villages where the Swajaldhara and TSC projects are being implemented either jointly by the&#13;
      same implementing agencies/local bodies or separately by different agencies/line&#13;
      departments. In the latter case the total score of the PIC will be out of a maximum of 2250&#13;
      (Water Supply-1500 and Sanitation-750).&#13;

4.2   Benchmarking&#13;
&#13;
A system of benchmarking offers standardized measures of performance, which all the TSC&#13;
states could work to achieve. This would also help assess and compare the performance of&#13;
states in terms of internalization of the reform principles and the initiative to undertake&#13;
corrective measures, as required. This would basically offer a way to admit that another&#13;
village, district or state is better at something and provide an opportunity to learn as to how to&#13;
match or surpass it.&#13;
&#13;
It would help facilitate the process of identifying, sharing, and using best practices to improve&#13;
processes. The process could entail exercises comparing data (usually key performance&#13;
indicators) either between villages, districts and States or tracking performance over time.&#13;
Whereas these provide comparative measures, they do not in themselves result in the&#13;
identification or exchange of best practice. It would help examine processes, compare&#13;
activities and identify best practices that can be implemented for effecting performance&#13;
improvement.&#13;
&#13;
It could be ideally used to achieve the following:&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Encourage the exchange of best practice in pursuit of general objectives.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about initiating actions for&#13;
            improvement.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Set performance targets for ensuring sustainability of investments and benefits.&#13;
      â&#128;¢     Share information to identify areas where there is an apparent performance gap.&#13;
&#13;
There have been some obvious constraints in developing benchmarks, particularly for&#13;
assessing the progress of the reform initiative itself. There has been hardly any precedence&#13;
in terms of available reference values for some of the components of the reform program. As&#13;
an initiative to introduce far-reaching changes in sector functioning on demand responsive&#13;
lines on a major scale, the TSC program has to have some well-defined benchmarks for&#13;
making a comparative assessment across states.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.1 Benchmark categories&#13;
&#13;
In view of the reform objectives and principles as enshrined in the new TSC guidelines, four&#13;
sets of benchmarks have been identified in order to have a comparative assessment of the&#13;
progress being made in various TSC states. These are:&#13;
â&#128;¢     Generating demand &amp; Creation of an Enabling Environment (GDEE);&#13;
â&#128;¢     Promotion of Appropriate and Cost-effective Technology and Alternative Delivery&#13;
      Mechanisms (PACT);&#13;
â&#128;¢     Functionality, Access and Privacy of Sanitation Facilities (FAPS); and&#13;

                                                                            Total Symerwl:onsultln!l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢     Usage, Maintenance and Sustainability of Sanitation Assets (UMS).&#13;
&#13;
 It is foreseen that quality performance in all these categories would be necessary for States&#13;
 to realize the benefits of the program and ensure sustainability of investments and benefits.&#13;
 While certain benchmarks could be attainable over a shorter duration of time, attainment of&#13;
 others would be ensured only over a longer period of time through concerted efforts.&#13;
&#13;
 4.2.2 !Benchmark monitoring&#13;
&#13;
 The monitoring and evaluation system would propose numeric references for benchmarks,&#13;
 which all states must aspire to attain over the life of the program. However, since there are&#13;
 different levels of preparedness based on prior experience of managing demand responsive&#13;
 programs, states would be free to assign time limits over which they would like to monitor&#13;
 attainment of benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
 Benchmarks would be monitored directly through the information flow against indicators&#13;
 being proposed for monitoring of activities. However the monitoring of benchmarks would&#13;
 also heavily thrive on the periodic review component and community monitoring system being&#13;
 proposed under the monitoring and evaluation system after exit from a village.&#13;
&#13;
 The information being fed in the computer, based on indicators, would generate status of&#13;
 attainment of benchmarks and a report for each state on actual attainment against desired&#13;
 level can be generated.&#13;
&#13;
 4.2.3 Benchmarks: Desirables vs. actuals&#13;
&#13;
 The benchmarking exercise would be carried out at the state level and the related reports&#13;
 would be generated by the computerised MIS on the basis of data already entered therein.&#13;
 The following table on benchmarks matrix contains the desired benchmark categories, the&#13;
 indicators to be employed for measuring the performance against it and the desired level to&#13;
 be attained under each benchmark category. The information regarding actual attainment&#13;
 against desired level would be generated through computer on the basis of information&#13;
 already recorded therein against various indicators.&#13;

        conltributing factors have a direct bearing on the benchmarks, others though important have&#13;
        subsidiary bearings. Quality points have been assigned to the directly affecting contributing&#13;
        factors. The total values of these directly affecting contributing factors have been made the&#13;
        target benchmark value for that category. The major contributing factors for each of the&#13;
        benchmark category and their quality point are indicated below:&#13;

would be used for analyzing trends and identifying practices that enable and hinder better&#13;
performance. The stakeholders would discuss the key findings and have an opportunity to&#13;
interact with each other and with the best-practice villages, districts or states. These would&#13;

  5.1    Background&#13;
&#13;
 Since the launch of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in April 1999, around 400 projects&#13;
 have been sanctioned in different districts across the country. These projects are at various&#13;
 stages of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
 Till recently, the progress of implementation in the various districts, was monitored manually&#13;
 by the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission (RGNDWM). Data in the prescribed&#13;
 formats was sent by post to the Mission and, thereafter, necessary information processing&#13;
 was done manually in order to produce required outputs. This method was time consuming&#13;
 and heavily reliant on the person dealing with this data. These bottlenecks were subsequently&#13;
 ironed out by the introduction and use of a computer based information system, using WEB&#13;
 based technology, which enables easy data access and retrieval from any location on the&#13;
 globe, over the Internet.&#13;
&#13;
 The present software being used by RGNDWM takes care of the various TSC project issues&#13;
 listed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         1.    Project Sanctioned details for Districts Projects.&#13;
         2.    Funds released by Mission to Districts under TSC.&#13;
         3.    Monthly Financial statements (Funds released by the States I Beneficiaries &amp;&#13;
               Utilized by districts) received from Districts.&#13;
         4.    Monthly Physical Achievement (Households Latrines, School Toilets, Balwadi&#13;
               Toilets, Community Sanitary Complexes, RSM, PC etc.) received from districts.&#13;
         5.    TSC Action Plan for 2003-2004.&#13;
         6.    List of Contact Persons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The total volume and diversified nature of the data that gets generated out of the system,&#13;
 calls for a proper information system planning. This is expected to streamline monitoring and&#13;
 reconciliation activity of funds and resources.&#13;

Objectives and Benefits of the online monitoring system being used by RGNDWM&#13;
presently:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ~      Centralized database for monitoring all the projects.&#13;
      ~      Speeds up information flow from the Districts.&#13;
      ~      Improved efficiency, performance and speed in decision-making process.&#13;
      ~      Enhanced security of the system with password protection.&#13;
      ~      Ease in historical Data Maintenance.&#13;
      ~      Elimination of human error in processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Besides the online monitoring MIS-based computerized system being followed by the TSC,&#13;
there are other M &amp; E methods being used like the conventional report system, field visits,&#13;
review meetings, course corrections, community based monitoring, independent agency&#13;
monitoring mid line and end line surveys.&#13;
&#13;
5.2 Limitations of present M &amp; E System&#13;
&#13;
While the present system being followed by the Mission is quite comprehensive and well&#13;
thought out, there are some inherent limitations, which are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
      ~     There is no proper system formulated for information flow from the TSC villages&#13;
            to the blocks and then on to the districts. Therefore, there is the danger that the&#13;
            information fed online at the district level, may not be based on hard facts coming&#13;
            up from the grass-root level and thus, it may not be totally reliable. There is no&#13;
            check and balance mechanism in-built for cross-verification of data being fed into&#13;
            the system.&#13;
&#13;
      ~     The physical and financial progress of the project are not the only factors to be&#13;
            monitored. The present system does not cater to the monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
            qualitative, process-based aspects of the project, which are so essential to the&#13;
            reform initiatives in this sector.&#13;
&#13;
      ~     There are no systems developed for giving feed-back to the community and for&#13;
            the follow-up of any remedial actions and mid-course corrections recommended&#13;
            as a result of M &amp; E activities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     A scoring mechanism or benchmarks have not been developed, by which one&#13;
             can tell where a particular TSC village, district or state stands in comparison to&#13;
             others and in which particular aspect they need to improve their functioning and&#13;
             implementation, in order to be successful.&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     Community-based monitoring which is essential for a 'community-led', 'people-&#13;
             centred' project, is as yet not a part and parcel of the existing M &amp; E system.&#13;
             Unless this is made an integral part of the M &amp; E system, the sense of ownership&#13;
             of the project and their effective participation in all it's processes will not be&#13;
             fostered.&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     The existing system is almost entirely quantitative in nature and there is an&#13;
             inherent danger that there may be misrepresentation of facts and figures in the&#13;
             enthusiasm of functionaries to show timely and speedy project progress.&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     Result-oriented and thorough monitoring and evaluation needs trained and&#13;
             earmarked personnel, who work through proper channels in a systematized&#13;
             manner so that flow of information to and from the field is not, blocked anywhere.&#13;
             There is not much clarity regarding these flow channels and systems in the&#13;
             existing M &amp; E system. Hence, there is lack of accountability.&#13;
&#13;
5.3 Strategy for Management of Proposed M &amp; E of Total Sanitation Campaign&#13;
&#13;
Currently, in many states water supply and sanitation are being managed independently by&#13;
separate organizations. However it is envisaged that States would implement water supply&#13;
and sanitation in an integrated manner and existing SWSM, DWSMs and VWSCs at the&#13;
state, district and village levels would be responsible for both Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
and all their various dimensions. The proposed M&amp;E system of TSC would rely heavily on the&#13;
proposed institutional arrangement i.e. DWSM and SWSM for managing the reform projects.&#13;
&#13;
In line with the above scenario in which water supply and sanitation are being jointly&#13;
managed by the same implementing/facilitating agencies/organizations at all levels, it is&#13;
anticipated that there would be substantial savings in the management costs of the M&amp;E&#13;
system. The following costs should be common and shared by both projects:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     Hardware and software costs at the state and district/sub-divisional levels.&#13;
&#13;
       &gt;     Costs of conducting the State and District Periodic Reviews as they can be jointly&#13;
             conducted. Only if there are villages in which only TSC or only Swajaldhara are&#13;
             being implemented in isolation, costs would have to be booked separately under&#13;
             the respective programmes by concerned department/agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                               Private LlmltBd&#13;
                                                                                 lotallhiiUifgy COIIS!lltillg&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        ~     Training of trainers on MIS, periodic review and community monitoring can also&#13;
              be done jointly as the components and methods to be followed are very similar in&#13;
              nature.&#13;
        ~     The costs to be incurred on additional staff members also will be common as&#13;
              these staff members will be handling the M&amp;E workload of both Swajaldhara and&#13;
              TSC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 It is foreseen that State's would put in place a Core Group compnsmg multidisciplinary&#13;
 professionals for managing water supply and sanitation projects based on reform principles.&#13;
 At the village level, the VWSC members will be responsible for filling up the necessary&#13;
 information on the designed issues, fields and indicators in the prescribed formats and&#13;
 submitting them in a timely manner to the DWSC. All data entry would be done at the level of&#13;
 district through a team of Data Entry Operators (DEOs) supervised by an M&amp;E coordinator&#13;
 positioned in the Core Group exclusively for Swajaldhara and TSC. The District M&amp;E&#13;
 coordinator would be able to generate reports based on information provided by NGOs and&#13;
 fed into the computerized system by the DEOs.&#13;
&#13;
 It is proposed that professionals deployed in the Core Group be made responsible for a&#13;
 particular set of villages and all data/information generated from those set of villages would&#13;
 be analyzed by the responsible professional and necessary action initiated.&#13;
&#13;
 The information flow at different levels and agencies responsible for M&amp;E can be found in&#13;
 Annexure IV.&#13;
&#13;
 5.4 Suggested Management Structure&#13;
&#13;
 The proposed M &amp; E system comprises of three main components, namely a computerized&#13;
 MIS system which is quantitative in nature, a qualitative component which consists of a&#13;
 periodic review process and a community monitoring system. It is a bottom-up system, which&#13;
 has specified formats, and reports in which data has to be either recorded manually or fed&#13;
 into a computerized system.&#13;
&#13;
 5.4.1 Village Level&#13;
&#13;
 For the purposes of the proposed M &amp; E design of the TSC project, the first level of&#13;
 management would be at the village level. Since the unit for evaluation of various parameters&#13;
 at the community level is the village, which will be made of several habitations and at which&#13;
 the VWSC will be community-based organization responsible for day-to-day management of&#13;
 projE!Ct functions, it will be the VWSC itself who will be trained and made responsible to fill the&#13;
 necessary data in the Village Level One-Time (V0-10) and Monthly Information (VM-9)&#13;
 formats prescribed by the proposed M &amp; E design during the Planning and Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Design- M&amp;E Module for Go! (RGNDWM) CRSP I Total Sanitation Campaign                                       67&#13;
Chapter 5- Management Structure&#13;
&amp;#12; Phases. These formats will then be handed over to the concerned DWSC/ Core Group&#13;
 functionary at district level who is responsible for facilitation and project management of that&#13;
 particular TSC village. During the O&amp;M Phase, the VWSC will collect the relevant data using&#13;
 different methods and tools and fill it in the Inland Letter Format (VQ-11) and send it by post&#13;
 on a monthly basis to the DWSC. The training of VWSC and other responsible community&#13;
 members in M &amp; E methods and procedures may be conducted by a suitable NGO or training&#13;
 institution appointed for the purpose. Initially, the trainers will also have to be trained in these&#13;
 methods by persons who are proficient in the administration of the proposed M&amp;E module for&#13;
 TSC.&#13;
&#13;
 5.4.2 District level&#13;
&#13;
According to the TSC guidelines the district is envisaged to be the focal point for the overall&#13;
management of projects. Zilla Parishad/Panchayat (ZP) would be the agency responsible for&#13;
overall project planning and management at the district level. In cases where there is no ZP,&#13;
a DWSC will have to be specially constituted for the purpose.&#13;
&#13;
A core group of multi-disciplinary professionals would need to be set up at the district level. It&#13;
is proposed that the members of this core group at the district level carry the required&#13;
experience and skills in Communication, Human Resource Development, Monitoring and&#13;
School Sanitation &amp; Hygiene Education etc.&#13;
&#13;
The district would be the nerve centre of the designed M&amp;E system, as most of the related&#13;
critical functions such as data collection, entry, analysis and use would converge at that level.&#13;
The management structure suggested presupposes the presence of a full-time project&#13;
manager at the district level. Ideally it would be desirable to have a district project manager&#13;
for the purpose. However, in case of member secretary, DWSC being the overall in-charge,&#13;
which is generally an ex-officio position, it is recommended that suitable full time project&#13;
management assistance is made available for day-to-day management of project activities.&#13;
The same would be applicable where Zilla Parishad/Panchayat is managing the project at the&#13;
district level.&#13;
&#13;
The district project manager would need to be assisted by a core group of multi-disciplinary&#13;
professionals as indicated above. One of the team members must be a monitoring and&#13;
evaluation specialist, who is designated as the M&amp;E coordinator and is entrusted with the&#13;
responsibility of day-to-day management of the designed M&amp;E system. Other professionals in&#13;
the core group should be given the responsibility of field coordinators. Each field coordinator&#13;
would be allocated a number of villages/schemes and would be responsible for supervising&#13;
the work being done on the ground in the project villages.&#13;
&#13;
The field coordinators would be broadly of two types based on their specialization in&#13;
engineering and community development aspects. In the planning phase, the field&#13;
coordinator specializing in community development should be the lead coordinator with the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
one specializing in engineering aspects providing the required assistance. In implementation&#13;
these roles would be reversed and the engineering specialist would be the lead coordinator&#13;
with the community development specialist providing the necessary assistance. However,&#13;
this must be decided at the local level as per specific needs, demands and constraints in view&#13;
of the ground realities.&#13;
&#13;
For the purposes of data entry, the M&amp;E coordinator would be assisted by one or two data&#13;
entry operators as per requirement. However, the actual number of data Â·entry operators and&#13;
field coordinators in the district team would vary as per the number of villages actually&#13;
undertaken under TSC in a particular district.&#13;
&#13;
The field coordinators (core group members) shall ensure timely collection of data from the&#13;
VWSC as per the input formats designed and periodicity of collection agreed for the purpose&#13;
and make it available to the M&amp;E coordinator at the district level for its entry into the&#13;
computerized system by data entry operators. it would be the responsibility of the M&amp;E&#13;
coordinator to make sure that all data entered in the system is cross-checked by at least one&#13;
more person to avoid any errors of omission and commission.&#13;
&#13;
5.4.~1   State level&#13;
&#13;
Within the TSC framework, the State Government should set up an appropriate institutional&#13;
arrangement to monitor the projects and facilitate the districts in implementing TSC.&#13;
However, in states where Water supply &amp; sanitation are handled by two different&#13;
departments, separate institutional set up may also be made subject to the condition that&#13;
officials handling water supply should be actively associated with this.&#13;
&#13;
In view of the above, the states have been given a role in operationalising the designed M&amp;E&#13;
system both in terms of coordinating various functions related to the management of the&#13;
computerised MIS at the state and district levels on the one hand and organising periodic&#13;
review exercise in the TSC districts on a regular basis on the other.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of the periodic review exercise would be to identify areas of weakness in&#13;
imp!lementation and suggest measures for mid-course corrections and desired improvements.&#13;
A full time M&amp;E coordinator would be required to carry out all the necessary management&#13;
functions in this regard at the state level. The M&amp;E coordinator at the state level would report&#13;
to the member secretary SWSM. The specific responsibilities would include forming a review&#13;
team in each project district, drawing up a roaster for annual reviews to be carried out in each&#13;
TSC district in the state and making sure that the periodic reviews take place as scheduled&#13;
and the review scores and the related descriptive text are entered in the computer-based MIS&#13;
at the district level in time.&#13;
&#13;
Other important functions at the state level include integrating and operating communication&#13;
and capacity development programmes for both water supply and sanitation. This potentially&#13;

 includes an initiative to build the capacities of the concerned project functionaries at the state&#13;
 and district levels for an efficient and effective use of the M&amp;E MIS and also integrate the&#13;
 monitoring and evaluation functions related to water supply and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
 5.4.4 National level&#13;
&#13;
 As per the proposed M&amp;E system, RGNDWM at the Government of India level has the most&#13;
 crucial role in terms of an efficient and effective functioning of the system being designed.&#13;
 Some of the key functions of the system include web management related to IT-based MIS&#13;
 and parts of benchmarking, Performance Index Card (PIC) and the periodic review&#13;
 component of the system to be managed at the national level. Hence, a full time dedicated&#13;
 monitoring and evaluation coordinator is proposed to be put in place at the RGNDWM level&#13;
 for managing the system, as already suggested in Swajaldhara M&amp;E system design&#13;
 document. It is proposed to have one M&amp;E coordinator at the national level looking after both&#13;
 Swajaldhara and TSC.&#13;
&#13;
 The actual management of the web-based M&amp;E MIS has to be done centrally at the&#13;
 RGNDWM level on a day-to-day basis. This would require a full time IT specialist trained for&#13;
 the purpose. IT specialists from NIC currently placed with RGNDWM could be trained to&#13;
 manage the MIS, who could function as per the overall supervision and guidance provided by&#13;
 the M&amp;E coordinator at that level. The IT specialist would be assisted by the required number&#13;
 of data entry operators.&#13;
&#13;
 A panel of professionals would be prepared at the national level for the periodic review&#13;
 proposed to be carried out in each TSC state once in a year by RGNDWM. The professionals&#13;
 have to be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the sector. A list of&#13;
 professionals is reportedly already drawn at RGNDWM.&#13;
&#13;
 Operationalisation of this suggested management structure is dependent on appropriate and&#13;
 adequate capacity building, particularly training and technical assistance, to be carried out for&#13;
 desired skill up-gradation of the personnel involved at various levels.&#13;

 (2) Expenditure at state (SWSM) level&#13;
      (35 states/UTs x Rs. 7.80 Lakh)                                                                                                  = Rs. 273.00 lakh&#13;
&#13;
 (3) Expenditure at district (ZP/DWSM) level&#13;
      (600 districts x Rs. 6.60 Lakh)                                                                                                  =Rs. 3960.00 lakh&#13;

            Sanitation is an essential precondition
            of improvement in the quality of life of people. Lack of
            awareness regarding critical linkages between sanitation,
            hygiene, and health lie at the root of unsafe sanitary
            practices such as open defecation resulting in avoidable
            morbidity and mortality, especially of children in India, on
            a large scale every year. In terms of strategy to address
            the issue of sanitation, the conventional one of providing
            subsidies to individual households for constructing sanitary
            latrines has not really worked in any significant sense. It
            is now being increasingly realized that sanitation is
            essentially a community issue and effective results can be
            achieved only with the help of active community involvement.
            The existing monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system has
            been thoroughly reviewed and most of the elements have been
            incorporated into the M and E module for total sanitation
            campaign (TSC).It is aimed at promoting behavior change in
            people in order to ensure health and hygiene benefits on a
            sustainable basis. It has been ensured that many of the
            existing tools will feed into the M and E system with
            suitable amendments, so that there is a comprehensive
            coverage of all the components and processes involved. There
            will also be an integration of all M and E procedures in
            order to have a holistic evaluation of the entire project.
