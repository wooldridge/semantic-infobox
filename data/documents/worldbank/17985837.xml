Dean of the Board for many years.          In a way. it was exceptional.        As     tributaries.    There was an awful quarrel between India and Pakistan on&#13;

          Pakistan thought that the only way to satisfy their water needs      OLIVER:    You retained your seat as Executive Director1&#13;
would be to build a dam across the Indus river. COIIlparable to the Nile-      LIEFTINCK:      Yes. yes.     I spent about three years on that subject:         one&#13;

Aswam Dam. The Indus had treaendous water. but the World Bank was              year to prepare the main report of Tarabella and a second year to study&#13;

&#13;
very well from the start. Millions of acres were better irrigated than          LIEFI'INCK:    Well. who on the side of the staff proposed it. I don't&#13;

the Bank should not deviate from the original purpose and intention:                oppose that project, because an international organization of which&#13;

LIEFI'INCK:    I have difficulty remembering that.    There were people                  In those years, Pierre Paul Schweitzer. who was the Managing&#13;
&#13;
among the staff who did not like general purpose lending. and they may         Director of the Fund. felt strongly that something should be done to&#13;

&#13;
I have very good relationships with the staff: they often spoke openly         that some joint recreational facility might be helpful.          Such things&#13;
&#13;
to ae about the Board.     I remember there were a nuaber of staff who         more often existed in Europe than here.          So he sponsored strongly the&#13;

didn't like this at all. but I don't remember a general apprehension on        creation the Bretton Woods Recreational Center. (It is a beautiful&#13;

less to Latin American countries.       That aigbt have caused aaae            to pay $40-50 dollars a month.)&#13;
&#13;
apprehensions.     I'm not sure about it.   Would you care for another cup               Schweitzer contacted George Woods, and said this should be done&#13;

&#13;
LIEFTINCK.:    George Woods was vecy sensitive to evecything that related      said that if the Congress finds out that Bank money has been used for&#13;
&#13;

staff wanted.     I take from outside of the Bank operations an                investment was less than a million dollars.&#13;

justification of the proposal, I didn't feel, was satisfactory." We                LIEFI'INCK:    Not very much by way of innovations.        The most important&#13;

they embraced everything; whatever needed financing. McNamara was ready            OLIVER:   Not much about the First Replenishment.          It was the Second&#13;
&#13;
to give full consideration to it.     He set targets for the amounts to be         Replenishment which was quite controversial, I think.&#13;

&#13;
CLIVER:   Yes. quite right.     Did you personally feel that the request      countries got their instructions fro. their governments according to&#13;

for the Second Replenishment where George Woods really wanted a billion       the willingness of their governments to make large IDA contributions.&#13;

dollars a year was increasing the replenisbaent levels too fast?              They just followed the instructions of their governments.         They did&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK:    Well. I wondered whether the Bank staff could manage a          not. perhaps. less than I. share the concern for the integrity and&#13;
&#13;
thorough study of sufficient projects to reach that level.      I was         quality of the World Bank as a bank.&#13;
&#13;
afraid that. by the approach of the replenishments. the Bank would            &lt;LIVER:     I understand.&#13;
&#13;
become too liberal.      One of the principals that was adopted when we       LIEFl'INCÂ¥.:    I didn't want the bank to become just a channel for&#13;
&#13;
created IDA was that the saae criteria which were applied to World Bank       generosity.&#13;
&#13;
lending would be applied to IDA lending. and I wondered whether the           OLIVER:     Well, are there other questions about this period that I&#13;

&#13;
felt. on the other hand that there were tremendous needs for easy             LIEFl'INCK:     I don't think so.&#13;
&#13;

it very strongly -- maximizing the IDA repleniShments.                        been asking you about. and I have a fair idea of your own views on the&#13;
&#13;
CLIVER:   I think that the Dutch goverDDent. both in the World Bank and       subjects.      I can well understand why you were elected an Executive&#13;
&#13;
in the Developaent Assistance Caamittee of OECD. has always been with         Director for so many years. and I can well understand why you had the&#13;
&#13;
the Scandinavian countries in wanting to do as much as feasible in the        affection and esteem of your colleagues on the Board as well as the&#13;
&#13;
way of official government assistance.      So your concern was primarily     good will of the senior staff with whOM the Executive Directors had&#13;
&#13;
similar to that in the later McNamara years:      you weren't sure of         occasional contact.&#13;
&#13;
quality projects could really be found to satisfy that level of               LIEFl'INQC.:   Yes. a very good relationship was established.     Also, my&#13;
&#13;
increases.                                                                    personal relations with Gene Black and George Woods and. finally. with&#13;

LIEFl'INCK:   Exactly.                                                        McNamara were very good. They appreciated my very keen interest in the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Did you have support from other Executive Directors on this?        in,titutions.     In the time of    ~   association with McNamara, we had one&#13;
&#13;
LIEFI'INCK:   DevelopiiJ,g countries Executive Directors. as a matter of      thing in common: McNamara was originally an accountant.        He had a great&#13;
&#13;
fact, wanted the maximum.      The Executive Directors of the industrial      career as an accountant. and I wondered, when we entered that period of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           21                                                                          22&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
rapid inflation. should we not introduce into the World Bank inflation            LIEFI'INCX:    Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
accounting.     I once lll&amp;de a speech on that subject. and I remember that       OLIVER:     Well air you have been very generous with your time, and I am&#13;
&#13;
McNear a was very much interested: he dido' t     see how to do it but he         grateful indeed -- not only for your time, but for the opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
felt there was a need to give this saa.e consideration.                           meet you.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;LIVER:     That might have made s&lt;ae projects infeasible that otherwise          LIEP'l'INCX: Well, thank you.   I enjoyed our discussion.   It brought back&#13;
&#13;
looked feasible.                                                                  to me a situation in which I have been very imolved and to which I&#13;
&#13;
LIEF'l'INQC;   Yes.                                                               have given much of my time and energy.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     So he was interested. but he wasn't willing to recommend it?&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINa&lt;:     No. no. no.&#13;
&#13;
CLIVER:     Well the problems of disinflation are aaa.etillles alaost as&#13;
&#13;
great as the problems of inflation.&#13;
&#13;
LIEFTINCK:     That' a true. but we have not yet reached that stage of&#13;
&#13;
disinflation.&#13;
&#13;
cn..IVER:   I should have thought that saa.e of the problems of the large&#13;
&#13;
debts of soae of the dev-eloping countries. particularly in Latin&#13;
&#13;
America. are worse because of the disinflation: or. to put it another&#13;
&#13;
way. their apparent ability to keep up with their debts through ezport&#13;
&#13;
earnings was artificial in the sense that the value of the ezport&#13;
&#13;
earnings was being calculated at a different price level.&#13;
&#13;
LIEP'l'INQC:   That is true, but I wouldn't call that disinflation.        A&#13;
&#13;
declining world price level. particularly for rBIII materials. is very,&#13;
&#13;
very damaging to developing countries. overindebted as they are.           That&#13;
&#13;
is very true.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I guess instead of calling that disinflation I should have&#13;
&#13;
just said a slow-down in the rate of inflation.&#13;
