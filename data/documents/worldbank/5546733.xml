Focus on Maharashtra:&#13;
&#13;
Alternate Management Approaches&#13;
for Village Water Supply Systems&#13;
&#13;
Effective management arrangements for the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of rural water supply systems&#13;
are critical for sustainability. Institutional arrangements for O&amp;M may take a variety of forms. This note documents&#13;
some of the alternate approaches that are already in practice in various parts of Maharashtra.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1The cases described in this note and the approaches that they represent are not intended as models to be replicated. We expect, however, that the lessons drawn from&#13;
these cases will help policy-makers and sector professionals to come up with improved institutional designs for sustainable approaches in the management of&#13;
rural water supply schemes.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   Since the mid-1990s, the worsening fiscal situation in most states has compelled policy-makers&#13;
   to search for institutional options that would create a climate for meeting O&amp;M costs in a&#13;
   sustainable manner.&#13;

2 This is, of course, true for urban systems as well. The reference to `sustainability' in this paper is to the technical and financial aspects of the O&amp;M arrangements.&#13;
Although some of the issues are common, the paper does not focus on the issue of source sustainability.&#13;

4Some commentators and practitioners are of the view that local government involvement is not central to the CDD approach. However, others (including the authors&#13;
of this note) believe that a combination of accountable local governments and empowered communities is essential for good governance and delivery of quality services&#13;
at the local level.&#13;

Gram Panchayats; in others they are independently registered bodies.&#13;

&#13;
Presumably, the justification for this&#13;
approach is that if the user and&#13;
provider are one, accountability is&#13;
automatically assured.&#13;
&#13;
Although this may be true, it may&#13;
not be the most efficient solution in&#13;
all cases and in the long run, as&#13;
users have to spend considerable&#13;
time in management activities in&#13;
addition to their regular occupation.&#13;
Moreover, such an approach is&#13;
unlikely to foster professional&#13;
management and is difficult to&#13;
successfully replicate at scale.&#13;

Extension of this approach to other&#13;
sectors will (in some cases,&#13;

private operators typically first&#13;
installed the pumps then gradually&#13;
extended the pipes on their own&#13;
land and, thereafter, laid the mains&#13;
to the village, providing a gradually&#13;
increasing number of private&#13;
connections. The O&amp;M cost of the&#13;
scheme consists mainly of the&#13;
electricity charges and occasional&#13;
repairs. The pumps have not been&#13;
replaced since installation but have&#13;
been repaired as required. The&#13;
electricity charges paid by the&#13;
operators are not at the commercial&#13;
rates but at the subsidized rates at&#13;

    The table presents tariffs charged to rural water supply schemes and for agriculture. Where there is metering,&#13;
    the typical structure is of a two-part tariff with a fixed element based on the horsepower of the pump and a&#13;
    variable usage charge. The table shows that the tariffs for the two uses are quite similar. Tariffs for both uses&#13;
    are lower than the tariffs for most other categories of users. In addition, there is a 50 percent subsidy for rural&#13;
    water supply schemes, which is now being gradually phased out.&#13;

            Focus on Maharashtra : alternate management
            approaches for village water supply systems
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since the mid-1990s, the worsening
            fiscal situation in most states has compelled policy-makers
            to search for institutional options that would create a
            climate for meeting O&amp;M costs in a sustainable manner.
            Effective management arrangements for the operation and
            maintenance (O&amp;M) of rural water supply systems are
            critical for sustainability.2 Institutional arrangements for
            O&amp;M may take variety of forms, including management by
            government owned agencies (the traditional approach),
            management by user groups (an emerging approach), and
            management by public or private sector providers through
            formal or informal contracts or agreements with the owners
            of the assets.  This note documents some of the alternate
            approaches that are already in practice in various parts of
            Maharashtra.  The author notes that for various reasons,
            none of the schemes described in this study faces the true
            costs of power and that it is not obvious how these schemes
            would fare if compelled to bear the true cost of power,
            particularly where power costs are typically between 50
            percent and 70 percent of operating costs.
