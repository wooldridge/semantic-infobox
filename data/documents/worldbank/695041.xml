        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The government of Trinidad and Tobago
            has adopted a two-phased approach to privatizing its water
            services.  In the first phase, a preconcession, or enhanced
            management contract, was recently awarded through a
            competitive bidding process.  After three to five years, in
            the second phase, this management contract will be converted
            to a long-term concession for which the incumbent will have
            first rights of negotiation.  With the management contract
            now in place for less than a year, it is too early to draw
            firm lessons.  But the two-phase strategy looks like a good
            choice for a small country with poor sector information and
            limited regulatory capacity.  The preconcession agreement
            gives the government time to gather information for better
            risk allocation in the future, develop a long-term tariff
            regime, and establish a relationship of trust with a private
            operator--while it also improves service using private
            sector management.  This Note discusses the strengths and
            weaknesses of the strategy.
