            Private rural power - network expansion
            using an output-based scheme in Guatemala
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 1998 the government of Guatemala
            privatized the two companies responsible for distributing
            electricity in rural areas. The new owner, Union Fenosa, was
            obliged to implement an ambitious five-year rural
            electrification program. The goal: to increase the share of
            households with an electricity connection from 64 percent to
            90 percent by 2004. Under this output-based scheme the two
            companies are paid US$650 for each eligible residential
            connection made. If no connections are made, no payment is
            made. So far the scheme has performed well-completing
            122,000 new rural connections between May 1999 and May
            2002-and is on track for the 2004 targets.
