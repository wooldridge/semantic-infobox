Across the globe citizens are demanding account-&#13;
ability and transparency from their governments.&#13;
Middle-income countries (MICs) in the G-20 are&#13;
driving global growth and shifts in global power.&#13;
And access to information and technology through&#13;
mobile phones and social media are multiplying&#13;
opportunities for citizens to provide feedback-&#13;
transforming the way we do development.&#13;
This fast changing global environment is&#13;
forcing the development community to adapt-&#13;
to do development differently. It's no longer only&#13;
about finance. It's about transparency in govern-&#13;
ment, access to the latest global knowledge, and&#13;
using innovative ways to solve development chal-&#13;
lenges. This builds the capacity of citizens to find&#13;
their own solutions to development challenges,&#13;
sustain growth, and fight poverty.&#13;
Our role and approach&#13;
The World Bank Institute (WBI) supports the&#13;
World Bank's operational work and its country&#13;
clients in this rapidly changing landscape by&#13;
forging new dynamic approaches to capacity&#13;
development. This is how we help government&#13;
and nongovernment stakeholders make change&#13;
happen. WBI offers three clusters of support to&#13;
its developing-country clients:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿* Open Knowledge: connecting them to        WBI's multicountry, multistakeholder&#13;
global knowledge and learning on the   approach provides a platform for policy makers&#13;
"how" of reform,                       and practitioners to learn from the experiences&#13;
* Collaborative Governance: helping them to  of others who face similar challenges, and to&#13;
mobilize for collective action, and    use this knowledge to find solutions to their own&#13;
* Innovative Solutions: scanning and     development needs.&#13;
incubating innovations to tackle key&#13;
development challenges.&#13;

            Capacity for development : leveraging the
            power of knowledge, innovation, and coalitions for change
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Across the globe citizens are demanding
            accountability and transparency from their governments.
            Middle-income countries (MICs) in the Argentina, Australia,
            Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,
            Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
            South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United
            States - along with the European Union (EU) (G-20) are
            driving global growth and shifts in global power. This fast
            changing global environment is forcing the development
            community to adapt - to do development differently. The
            World Bank Institute (WBI) supports the World Bank’s
            operational work and its country clients in this rapidly
            changing landscape by forging new dynamic approaches to
            capacity development. This helps the government and
            nongovernment stakeholders to make change happen. WBI offers
            three clusters of support to its developing-country clients:
            open knowledge; collaborative governance; and innovative
            solutions. WBI’s multi-country, multi-stakeholder approach
            provides a platform for policy makers and practitioners to
            learn from the experiences of others who face similar
            challenges, and to use this knowledge to find solutions to
            the development needs.
