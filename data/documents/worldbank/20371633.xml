The Network Value Chain&#13;
By Evan Bloom, Matt Reeves, and Aaron Leonard&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   In response to a growing demand for evidence of effectiveness, scalability, and accountability in interna-&#13;
   tional development initiatives, the international development community has begun to ask increasingly&#13;
   hard questions about the costs, risks, and assessment challenges associated with its capacity develop-&#13;
   ment initiatives. The delivery of capacity development services through networks represents an important&#13;
   and growing segment of the engagement strategy being embraced by development practitioners. Despite&#13;
   this growing interest and application, the understanding of how networks for capacity development oper-&#13;
   ate and how to maximize their impact remains limited. This CD Brief suggests applying a value chain&#13;
   approach to network development and explores how it can be used to build systematic partnerships to&#13;
   solve social problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  What do value chains have to do with networks?             settled on a network value chain that consists of three&#13;
Sometimes the best way to understand the future is           key domainsâ&#128;&#148;connect, develop, and scale-up. Each of&#13;
to look back into the past. The network value chain          these domains, in turn, can be subdivided into specific&#13;
pushes managers tasked with improving the perfor-            functions (figure 1). The three domains of the network&#13;
mance of networks to adopt a tailored, end-to-end            value chain are broad enough to apply to a range of&#13;
approach to generating, converting, and diffusing solu-      different network forms, while simultaneously being&#13;

ing single-actor solutions into an integrated flow. The      realities.&#13;
network value chain is an approach that can help chart&#13;
a future for systematic partnership and new coalitions.&#13;

  Box 6: Leading Practice: Microcredit Summit Campaign&#13;
&#13;
  Through an enabling networking structure, active volunteer base, and high concentration of social capital, the Microcredit&#13;
  Summit Campaign was critical in putting microcredit at the forefront of the development agenda. As Prime Minister Driss&#13;
  Jettou of Morocco puts it, â&#128;&#156;the Microcredit Summit Campaign has played a determining role in the worldwide success of micro-&#13;
  finance.â&#128;&#157; The campaign began in 1997 as a summit with 2,900 delegates from 137 countries, who launched a nine-year&#13;
  campaign to reach 100 million of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest families with microcredit by the end of 2005. In November 2006, the&#13;
  campaign was launched with two new goals: reaching 175 million of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest families and ensuring that 100 million&#13;
  families rise above the US$1 a day threshold, adjusted for purchasing power parity, between 1990 and 2015.&#13;
&#13;
  Outcomes of the campaign have been impressive, although the original goal of reaching the 100 million poorest has only been&#13;
  80 percent achieved. As of 2005, more than 3,000 microcredit institutions had reported reaching more than 130 million clients,&#13;
  of which 82 million were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Of these poorest clients, 84 percent or nearly 69&#13;
  million were women. Of the microcredit institutions, 847 submitted an institutional action plan in 2006; these 847 institutions&#13;
  account for 88 percent of the poorest clients reported. Assuming five persons per family, the 82 million poorest clients reached&#13;
  by the end of 2005 affected some 410 million family members. For more information see http://www.creditsummit.org.&#13;

            The network value chain
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In response to a growing demand for
            evidence of effectiveness, scalability, and accountability
            in international development initiatives, the international
            development community has begun to ask increasingly hard
            questions about the costs, risks, and assessment challenges
            associated with its capacity development (CD) initiatives.
            The delivery of CD services through networks represents an
            important and growing segment of the engagement strategy
            being embraced by development practitioners. Despite this
            growing interest and application, the understanding of how
            networks for capacity development operate and how to
            maximize their impact remains limited. This CD brief
            suggests applying a value chain approach to network
            development and explores how it can be used to build
            systematic partnerships to solve social problems.
