ANNEX IV OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
AGREEMENT ON THE VERIFICATION CLAUSE OF THE EC-WORLD BANK&#13;
GROUP FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT&#13;
I - Interpretation of verification provisions&#13;
As regards the verification clause, including as incorporated in Section 16.06 (ii) of the&#13;
Attachment 2 to the Framework Agreement, it is agreed that all financial information relevant&#13;
to the Projects and activities financed by the European Community shall, upon request, be&#13;
supplied to the European Community. It is understood that the information shall be drawn&#13;
from accounts and records and will be in a form which makes it possible for the Community&#13;
to verify the use to which its funds or contributions have been put. It is further agreed and&#13;
understood that clarifications, including verification of specific documents, may be requested&#13;
by the European Community. If so requested by the European Community, each World Bank&#13;
Group entity will, where appropriate, request its external auditors to respond directly to the&#13;
European Community in respect of such clarification.&#13;
As regards the checks to which reference is made in Section 16.07 of the Attachment 2 to the&#13;
Framework Agreement, it is understood that representatives of the European Community will&#13;
be given access to the site of the Project or the headquarters of the World Bank Group, taking&#13;
into account, in the case of the Commission, the guidelines for on-the-spot verification under&#13;
point II below. World Bank Group staff will supply all relevant financial and operational&#13;
information and will explain to the European Community representatives, with appropriate&#13;
concrete examples, how the accounts are managed and the procedures used to ensure&#13;
transparency and accuracy in the accounts and to guard against the misuse of funds and fraud.&#13;
The purpose of such on-the-spot checks is to allow representatives from the Community to be&#13;
in a position to report to their own institutions and to the European Parliament on the&#13;
implementation of Projects and actions and whether value for money has been obtained. It is&#13;
understood that such on-the-spot checks will be limited to information on the use of the&#13;
financing provided by the European Community and is without prejudice to the immunities of&#13;
the World Bank Group entities as set forth in their respective Articles of Agreement or&#13;
Conventions.&#13;
Any question of application and interpretation of and any dispute arising from this&#13;
Attachment shall be resolved by amicable means between the European Community and the&#13;
relevant World Bank Group entity, without prejudice to Article 14 of the Framework&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
Each party to this Attachment is to bear its own costs under the arrangements.&#13;
II - Guidelines for on-the-spot verification missions by Commission services to World&#13;
Bank Group entities&#13;
Purpose of verification missions&#13;
Commission services which are responsible for financing or co-financing Projects&#13;
administered by the World Bank Group entities are required by the Financial Regulation to&#13;
verify the legality and regularity of the expenditure and that it is in accordance with the&#13;
principles of sound financial management. These provisions - the verification clause - are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿29&#13;
contained in the Administration Agreements concluded between the Commission and the&#13;
World Bank Group entity concerned.&#13;
Preparation of the mission&#13;
Requests by the Commission for on-the-spot verification missions shall be sent to the Bank's&#13;
Concessional Finance and Global Partnerships Vice Presidency.&#13;
In order to ensure that this Attachment functions satisfactorily, it is important that the&#13;
missions are carefully prepared, that sufficient notice, at least two months, is given and that&#13;
the organization to be visited is informed in advance of the Projects to be verified. The&#13;
Commission and the relevant World Bank Group entity to be visited shall agree in advance on&#13;
procedural matters. These matters include timing and scope of the mission, questions the&#13;
mission wishes to review with the management of the relevant World Bank Group entity,&#13;
nature of the financial information, level of sampling and whether missions are to visit&#13;
headquarters locations and/or field offices. This is without prejudice to common terms of&#13;
reference that may be agreed between the Commission and the World Bank Group as a tool to&#13;
facilitate the conduct of these missions.&#13;
This will ensure that the necessary documentation, which may not be readily available, can be&#13;
prepared. It will also enable the internal and external auditors to be advised so that the internal&#13;
auditor, and where possible, the external auditor, is available to assist the mission team.&#13;
Access to original documentation held by a World Bank Group entity will, subject to such&#13;
entity's document retention policy, be ensured. The relevant entity will assist the mission&#13;
team in seeking access to original documentation held by third parties.&#13;
Coordination for mission programmes&#13;
It is essential that the mission team takes full account of the findings of previous missions to&#13;
the same organization by other Commission services and the European Court of Auditors.&#13;
The Commission is taking steps to ensure that the different services are aware of the mission&#13;
programmes of all the Commission services, including other Directorates General, and of the&#13;
European Court of Auditors, in order that each service takes appropriate account of the&#13;
programmes of the other services. It is important to avoid duplication and overlap. The&#13;
Commission is also exploring the possibility of obtaining and distributing the audit&#13;
programmes of the World Bank Group entities themselves in order to rationalize the overall&#13;
audit operation.&#13;
Conduct of the mission&#13;
The mission should be conducted in a spirit of partnership with the internal auditor and the&#13;
operational and accounting services of the World Bank Group entities. The mission will be&#13;
carried out by Commission representatives in a reasonable manner and without creating an&#13;
undue burden on the World Bank Group entity's regular operations.&#13;
The object is not to carry out a full-scale audit of the organization but to verify, by sample-&#13;
checking, how the European Community funds have been used.&#13;
In carrying out these checks, the mission team will work as far as possible in close&#13;
collaboration with the internal and external audit services of the relevant World Bank Group&#13;
entity, which will allow the visual verification by Commission controllers of original&#13;
justifying vouchers such as invoices, replies to calls for tender, proof of payments, curricula&#13;
vitae, justifying vouchers in the case of sub-contracting etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿30&#13;
The mission team has access to all original documents, without exception, for verification&#13;
purposes. Documents will only be photocopied if this is necessary and copies will not be&#13;
taken of documents which the relevant World Bank Group entity considers particularly&#13;
sensitive.&#13;
In cases where the mission team identifies serious problems of mismanagement, irregularity,&#13;
weaknesses in the control systems and procedures, or where they consider it necessary to take&#13;
photocopies of particularly sensitive documents, they will request the external auditor to&#13;
examine the matters in accordance with the first paragraph of point I of this Attachment 3.&#13;
Procedure for dealing with problems arising during a mission&#13;
If problems arise concerning access to documentation or any other aspect of this Attachment,&#13;
the mission team should contact immediately the responsible Director at Commission&#13;
headquarters in order that difficulties may be resolved without delay and the mission&#13;
completed on time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿31&#13;
ANNEX 5 OF THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT&#13;
AGREEMENT ON THE VISIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION CLAUSE OF THE EC-&#13;
WORLD BANK GROUP FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
This Attachment aims at clarifying the scope of the visibility clause included in Article 8 of&#13;
the Framework Agreement, as well as establishing a course of action for improving public&#13;
understanding of the role of the Parties in co-financed operations.&#13;
It describes actions to be undertaken to strengthen the understanding of and support for key&#13;
development messages among authorities, non-state actors and the general public in&#13;
beneficiary countries, authorities, non-state actors and general public in the EU member&#13;
states and interested parties in the wider donor community.&#13;
Respect of the visibility provisions of the Framework Agreement&#13;
(1)   The Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the visibility provisions&#13;
of the Framework Agreement, as clarified by this Attachment, are duly respected, and&#13;
that their departments, both in headquarters and in their country offices, comply with&#13;
their respective visibility obligations. Where the action entails particular, context-&#13;
specific visibility requirements, the specific Administration Agreements signed by the&#13;
Parties complement the visibility provisions of the Framework Agreement, by&#13;
including a visibility plan adapted to the action to be financed or co-financed, and&#13;
incorporating the provisions of this Attachment.&#13;
(2)   The services of the Commission, including its Delegations, and the relevant services of&#13;
the World Bank Group, will, in the framework of their respective regular reporting&#13;
requirements, report on their assessment of the implementation of the visibility&#13;
provisions of the specific Administration Agreements.&#13;
(3)   The result of the reports on visibility mentioned in the previous paragraph will be&#13;
discussed in the preparations for the annual consultations between the Commission&#13;
and the World Bank Group provided for in Article 11 of the Framework Agreement.&#13;
Specific recommendations and proposals to improve the implementation of such&#13;
visibility provisions may then be adopted during the annual consultations.&#13;
(4)   Where appropriate to support such visibility requirements, funding may be included in&#13;
the program of development activities the trust fund is supporting.&#13;
Press information, reports and publications&#13;
The relevant World Bank Group entity will take all appropriate measures to publicise the fact&#13;
that an action has received funding from the European Union. Information given to the press and&#13;
to the beneficiaries of an action, all related publicity material, official notices, reports and&#13;
publications should acknowledge that the action was carried out "with funding provided in part&#13;
by the European Union" and display appropriately the European logo (twelve yellow stars on a&#13;
blue background).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿32&#13;
Equipment and vehicles&#13;
The World Bank Group entity's equipment and vehicles may carry its emblem and other&#13;
indications of ownership prominently displayed. In such cases, where equipment or vehicles and&#13;
major supplies have been purchased using funds provided by the European Community, the&#13;
relevant World Bank Group entity shall, and shall require entities contracted by the relevant&#13;
World Bank Group entity to, include appropriate acknowledgement on such vehicles,&#13;
equipment and major supplies (including display of the European logo).&#13;
High level visits&#13;
Where high level visits are planned concerning joint funded activities, the Parties will inform&#13;
each other and consider co-ordinating these visits and agreeing on joint messages.&#13;
Trust Fund Management&#13;
Where the Commission contributes more than 20% of a trust fund, it will expect to have a&#13;
significant role in the governance of the trust fund, including, where appropriate, co-chairing&#13;
any steering committee for the trust fund.&#13;
Joint press conferences, donor conferences and public debates&#13;
The World Bank Group and the Commission shall invite each other to participate at press&#13;
conferences, donor conferences and public debates on trust funds where the Commission is a&#13;
significant contributor.&#13;
Initiatives for a better visibility&#13;
The Parties will work together so that a better visibility in the field for co-financed actions&#13;
will support actions to improve visibility in the EU. Special initiatives such as material for&#13;
schools, website management and development, shared photo banks and TV spots will be&#13;
appropriately included in the visibility plan referred to above, and the necessary financial&#13;
provision made in the visibility plan.&#13;
Staff&#13;
Improving visibility in the field will depend primarily on initiatives of staff in both&#13;
institutions. These initiatives will be agreed during the negotiation of each trust fund and their&#13;
cost covered by the trust fund. The Parties commit themselves to improving the training of&#13;
staff in communication skills. Best practices will be disseminated as appropriate through&#13;
Commission and World Bank Group instruments.&#13;
Guidelines&#13;
The Parties will adopt joint guidelines in order to clarify and support the co-operation of their&#13;
country offices in relation to visibility, including the scope and format for visibility plans.&#13;
