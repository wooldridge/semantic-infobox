results indicate that improvements in hygiene practices alone, particularly hand&#13;

is very important from a policy perspective because, unlike improvements in&#13;

toilet facilities, such improvements do not have to rely heavily on investments&#13;

            Economic impacts of sanitation in the
            Philippines : a five-country study conducted in Cambodia,
            Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the
            Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This sanitation impact study employs a
            standardized peer-reviewed methodology. It follows the
            methodology also adopted in four other countries (Cambodia,
            Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam) with a view to generating
            comparable outputs for Southeast Asia. While the primary aim
            is to provide national estimates of the economic impact of
            poor sanitation, results are also presented by region in the
            Philippines, as well as by rural/urban, gender, and age
            breakdown where feasible. The study conducted a quantitative
            and qualitative assessment of the impacts of poor sanitation
            on health, water, tourism, and other welfare impacts. The
            inclusion of health was based on well-established links
            between sanitation and disease incidence. Water impacts were
            deemed important because poor sanitation is one of the
            causes of water pollution. This, in turn, leads to costly
            aversive behavior in response to less usable water
            resources. Moreover, pollution also affects the productivity
            of water resources by way of lower fisheries output. Other
            welfare impacts were included because the absence of
            sanitary facilities affects people in terms of the time
            spent accessing facilities and productivity in work and
            school. Finally, tourism was included in the study because
            poor sanitation facilities could influence the
            country's attractiveness as a tourist destination. The
            major goal of the study is to provide decision makers at the
            country and regional levels with better evidence on the
            negative economic impacts of poor sanitation. It also seeks
            to generate tentative estimates of the impacts that can be
            mitigated by investing in improved sanitation. This study is
            conducted under the Water and Sanitation Program-East Asia
            and the Pacific (WSP-EAP) Economics of Sanitation Initiative
            (ESI), applying a comprehensive sanitation impact evaluation
            methodology developed by the World Bank WSP. It draws
            largely on existing data sources available from governments,
            donors, nongovernmental agencies, and the scientific literature.
