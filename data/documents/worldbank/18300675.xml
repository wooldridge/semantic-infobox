A. INTRODUCTION                                                 Lao PDR has made significant strides in improving access&#13;

Access to improved sanitation is a major concern in the Lao     the proportion of the population with access to improved&#13;
Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Democratic Republic (PDR). Recent estimates            sanitation increased by 18% between 2005 and 2010 alone,&#13;
from the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply            from 45% to 63%, nationwide, exceeding the MDG target&#13;
and Sanitation (JMP) of the World Health Organization           of 54% access to improved sanitation. However, many chal-&#13;
(WHO) and the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNI-              lenges remain in terms of improving access. Recent studies&#13;
CEF) show that only 63% of the population of the country        by Baetings and Oâ&#128;&#153;Leary (2010) and Giltner et al. (2010)&#13;
had access to improved sanitation facilities in 2010. Sanita-   show that sanitation has received little attention from gov-&#13;

the population had access to improved facilities and about 3    water supply. Apart from limited funding, there are also&#13;
out of 10 people still practice open defecation. Within rural   coordination issues among the many government agencies&#13;
areas, access to improved sanitation also varies widely be-     involved in sanitation. The two studies mentioned above&#13;

This was more than 2 times higher than rural households&#13;
that did not have roads. There is also a wide discrepancy in    B. STUDY AIMS AND METHODS&#13;

     The findings discussed above have several key implications                           toilets regularly; (b) not all toilet facilities fully isolate water&#13;
     for sanitation decision makers. First, it pays to invest in                          from human excreta; and (c) households continue to practice&#13;
     sanitation improvements. Every intervention at every site                            boiling water despite having access to improved sanitation.&#13;

     current costs. Second, low-cost sanitation options (wet and                          the absence of centralized facilities for the treatment of water&#13;
     dry pit latrines) deliver relatively high economic benefits for                      in some sites are not the only source of water contamination.&#13;
     every kip that is invested compared to septic tanks and sew-&#13;

     to consider in situations where investment funds for sanita-                         sites had different types of facilities. This means that some&#13;
     tion improvements are scarce. Third, cost-effectiveness ra-                          care must be exercised in interpreting averages of results&#13;
     tios are also lower for wet and dry pit latrines compared to                         between the two sets of interventions because of inter-site&#13;
     toilets that have access to septic tanks â&#128;&#147; hence from a health                       variation. Second, the quantitative analysis did not include&#13;
     perspective, the focus should be on ensuring basic access for                        a number of benefits associated with improved sanitation.&#13;
     the entire population before moving populations further                              These benefits, which are very difficult to determine in mon-&#13;
     up the sanitation ladder (i.e. to septic tanks or sewerage).                         etary units, include impacts on the environment, tourism,&#13;
     Fourth, the results reinforce the widely held belief that the                        business, and intangible aspects (comfort, prestige, privacy,&#13;
     viability of a sanitation option is sensitive to site-specific                       convenience and safety). While these impacts were analyzed&#13;
     conditions. This is partially supported by the differences                           qualitatively, their potential impact on the quantitative esti-&#13;
     between the efficiency indicators across rural and urban ar-                         mates should not be ignored. For example, the importance&#13;
     eas. Within rural and urban areas, the absolute and relative                         of privacy, convenience and safety are likely to raise the ben-&#13;
     values of the options also vary by site.                                             efits of toilets that are located within or very near the house.&#13;
                                                                                          Similarly, the ability to quantify the benefits associated with&#13;
     The results presented above reflect ideal conditions. How-                           comfort and prestige are likely to raise the net gains associ-&#13;

     in the use of the facilities in actual settings. Figure C shows                      facilities may also be higher if their environmental benefits&#13;

results from the qualitative analysis, and the tourism and                                    nology are accounted for by variations in the materials used&#13;

to note that the costs do not include expenses for sanita-                                    sources was 16% of the investment cost from donor agencies&#13;

&amp;#12;  Glossary of Terms&#13;
        Beneï¬&#129;t-cost ratio (BCR): the ratio of the present value of the stream of benefits to the present value of the&#13;
        stream of costs. A higher BCR implies a more efficient intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per case averted: the discounted value of the cost of each case of a disease that is avoided because of&#13;
        an intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per DALY averted: the discounted value of the cost of each DALY that is avoided because of an&#13;
        intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost per death averted: the discounted value of the cost of each death that is avoided because of an&#13;
        intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Cost-effectiveness ratio (CER): the ratio of the present value of the future cost to the present value of&#13;
        the future health benefits in non-monetary units (cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life years). The lower the&#13;
        CER the more efficient the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
        Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY): a measurement of the gap between current health status and an&#13;
        ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.&#13;
        One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of â&#128;&#156;healthyâ&#128;&#157; life (WHO, 2010).&#13;
&#13;
        Improved sanitation: the use of the following facilities in home compounds: flush/pour-flush to&#13;
        piped sewer system/septic tank/pit latrine, ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, or&#13;
        composting toilet (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Shared sanitation facilities: sanitation facilities of an otherwise acceptable type shared between two or&#13;
        more households. Only facilities that are not shared or not public are considered improved (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Open defecation: the practice of disposing human feces in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water,&#13;
        beaches or other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste (JMP, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
        Intangible beneï¬&#129;ts: benefits of improved sanitation that are difficult to quantify. These include impacts&#13;
        on the quality of life, comfort, security, dignity, and personal and cultural preferences.&#13;
&#13;
        Internal rate of return (IRR): the discount rate for which the present value of the stream of net benefits is&#13;
        zero. In other words, the discount rate that makes the BCR equal to unity (1).&#13;
&#13;
        Net beneï¬&#129;t: the difference between the present value of the stream of benefits and the present value of the&#13;
        stream of costs.&#13;
&#13;
        Net present value (NPV): the discounted value of the current and future stream of net benefits from a&#13;
        project.&#13;

                     Payback period (PBP): represents the number of periods (e.g. years) necessary to recover the costs&#13;
                     incurred to that time point (investment plus recurrent costs).&#13;
&#13;
                     Sewage: water-borne human or animal waste removed from residences, buildings, institutions, industrial&#13;
                     and commercial establishments together with groundwater, surface water and storm water. Liquid and&#13;
                     solid waste carried off in sewers or drains.&#13;
&#13;
                     Septage: the sludge produced in individual onsite wastewater-disposal systems, principally septic tanks&#13;
                     and cesspools. These also represent the contents of septic tanks.&#13;
&#13;
                     Sewerage: a network of pipelines, ditches and channels, including pumping stations and force mains,&#13;
                     and service connections including other devices for the collection, transport and treatment of sewage.&#13;
&#13;
                     Strategic sanitation: a concept based on the following principles (Rosenweig and Perez, 2002):&#13;
&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Ensuring that any plan to improve sanitation services is financially sustainable&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Consulting households to understand what sanitation solutions are in use and what expectations people&#13;
                           have&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Using a public consultation process with stakeholders to discuss the options&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Including a specific health component to maximize health benefits&#13;
                         â&#128;¢ Selecting an appropriate model for managing the provision of sanitation services to ensure sustainability&#13;
&#13;
                     Unimproved sanitation: the use of the following facilities anywhere: flush/pour flush without isolation or&#13;
                     treatment, pit latrine without slab/open pit, bucket, hanging toilet/hanging latrine, use of a public facility&#13;
                     or sharing any improved facility, no facilities, bush or field (open defecation) (JMP, 2008).&#13;

     The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) was conducted in Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province),&#13;
     Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam. The study was led by the East Asia and and the Pacific&#13;
     Office of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), with the contribution of WSP teams and&#13;
     consultants in each of the participating countries. The study took three years to complete, and has undergone&#13;
     several major peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
     Guy Hutton (WSP Senior Water and Sanitation Economist and Task Team Leader) led the development&#13;
     of the concept and methodology of the ESI, the management and coordination of the country teams, and&#13;
     provision of regional tools and templates. Bjorn Larsen contributed to the development of generic data&#13;
     collection tools and the health methodology. The study benefited from the continuous support of other WSP&#13;
     staff: Almud Weitz, Isabel Blackett, Yosa Yuliarsa, Irvan Tjondronegoro and WSP support staff.&#13;
&#13;
     The field team from Lao PDR was led by Alan Boatman (GeoSys Lao), with the support of Stephanie Cohen&#13;
     (Socio-economist and Project Coordinator), Frederic De San (Data Manager) and Vilaythong Chanthalinh&#13;
     (Field Manager). The enumerators for the survey were Manichanh Keolavihone, Khamsy Thammachack,&#13;
     Gorkham Silivongsa, Chanmay Xiong, and Bounchanh Sakounnavong. U-Primo E. Rodriguez (WSP&#13;
     Consultant) was responsible for the economic analysis and completing the write-up of the report.&#13;
&#13;
     Peer reviewers of this report were Craig Kullmann (WSP), Genevieve Boyreau (World Bank), Helene&#13;
     Carlsson (World Bank), Isabel Blackett (WSP), John McGown (Plan International), Mahboob Ahmed&#13;

  The JMP (2008) defines an improved sanitation facility as â&#128;&#156;one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contactâ&#128;&#157; (p.39). These include flush or pour&#13;
flush latrines connected to a piped sewer system, septic tank or pit latrine and ventilated improved pit latrine. On the other hand, unimproved facilities include pit&#13;
latrines without slab or platform, hanging latrines and bucket latrines. Pour-flush toilets that discharge into open drains, ditches or other bodies of water and facilities&#13;
shared by two or more households are also considered unimproved.&#13;

   VOSL studies attempt to value what individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death (e.g. safety measures) or willing to accept for an increase in the risk of&#13;
 death. These values are extracted either from observations of actual market and individual behavior (â&#128;&#156;hedonic pricingâ&#128;&#157;) or from what individuals stated in relation to&#13;
 their preferences from interviews or written tests (â&#128;&#156;contingent valuationâ&#128;&#157;). Both of these approaches estimate directly the willingness to pay of individuals, or society, for&#13;
 a reduction in the risk of death, and hence are more closely associated with actual welfare loss compared with the HCA.&#13;

 the same percentage of households said that their treatment                              ments in sanitation are quite small. The estimated annual&#13;
 practices changed after having access to improved water                                  savings from water access and treatment costs averaged across&#13;
 supplies. It is interesting to note that rural households ap-                            all sites were 21,000 kip (US$3) and 38,000 kip (US$5) per&#13;
 pear to be slightly more responsive to changes in sanitation                             household, respectively. These values capture the point that it&#13;

 of the rural respondents said that their treatment practice                              ment in sanitation. Since sanitation is not the only source of&#13;

 tion of these findings is that improvements in sanitation                                ter quality. This is in part supported by the earlier finding&#13;
 will have limited impacts on water treatment practices. At                               that water treatment practices do not change much following&#13;
 the very least, one cannot expect all households to change                               an improvement in sanitation and water supply (Figure 16).&#13;

VALUES OF TIME&#13;

There is evidence that households appreciate the value of                           private toilets said they were satisfied or very satisfied with&#13;
time associated with having a private toilet. Figure 20 shows                       the proximity of their toilets. The proportion of households&#13;
that at least 97% of households without a toilet cited prox-                        satisfied or very satisfied with the proximity of their toilet&#13;
imity as an important characteristic of having one. About                           was lower for those that only have access to shared/com-&#13;

a private toilet saves time.&#13;

The importance of proximity was also revealed in the survey                         with respect to convenience, based on FGDs conducted in&#13;
results for households that already have a toilet. Figure 20                        the six study sites. The highest ranked response related to&#13;

 pay for sanitation services was conducted by Harder et al. (2011) for the Philippines.&#13;

 Despite the availability of toilets, there is still evidence that                          a high likelihood that the health benefits from improved&#13;

   These are likely to be over-estimates. Curtis et al. (2009) cite that self-reporting with respect to handwashing, which was the case in the ESI surveys, has â&#128;&#156;poor validityâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
 (p. 656). The paper also summarized the results of studies in 11 countries, including Vietnam and selected provinces of China, which suggest that only 17% of mothers&#13;
 and caregivers wash their hands with soap and water after using the toilet.&#13;

The values presented in Figure 36 should be seen as an ini-                           accurate assessment of actual practices. For example, hand-&#13;
tial step in developing a set of measures for evaluating ac-                          washing may be combined with information on the clean-&#13;
tual benefits. Some of the indicators may be refined further                          liness of the toilet bowl or the cubicle itself, or even food&#13;
with more available information. For example, the propor-                             preparation. However, the development of such indicators&#13;
tion of people who wash their hands after defecation may be                           and how they will be used to adjust the benefits is the subject&#13;
augmented with information on the frequency with which                                of further studies. Despite its limitations, the indicators pre-&#13;

 toilets flushing to septic tanks are much more expensive                             this section. This is because the costs per household with&#13;

 The findings above suggest two clear points. First, relatively                      sanitation options, the most favorable and least favorable&#13;

 sanitation options. This is clear from the wide range of BCRs                       The efficiency indicators under actual conditions were also&#13;

 sults. For example, it was earlier found that toilets with access&#13;
 to sewers had more favorable BCRs than toilets with access to                          This section discusses the incremental net benefits of mov-&#13;
 septic tanks. However, a closer examination of the values in                           ing up the sanitation ladder. This is important for decision&#13;
 Figure 49 suggests the contrary. It indicates that the relatively                      makers considering investments in more advanced sanita-&#13;
 low BCR for septic tanks was influenced by the estimates for                           tion options. The analysis is relevant to Lao PDR because&#13;
 Site 5, which does not have a sewer system. When the two                               there are households that already have access to sanitation&#13;
 facilities are compared in a common location (Site 1), the                             options other than OD. Hence, in many cases, the key&#13;
 BCRs are slightly more favorable to septic tanks.                                      question might be to upgrade from a low cost option (e.g.&#13;
                                                                                        dry and wet pit latrines) to more expensive technologies&#13;
 A number of observations can be made from the efficiency                               (e.g. toilets with septic tanks).&#13;

 does not suggest that options higher-up the sanitation ladder                          one improvement to the next. Based on the BCRs, the&#13;
 (i.e. toilets with access to septic tanks or sewers), which have                       movement from shared wet pit latrines to improved facili-&#13;
 high NPVs, should be ignored. In addition, these findings                              ties will generate net losses (BCR &lt; 1). A similar conclusion&#13;
 must be treated with care because of noticeable differences in                         can be found in the movement from private dry pit latrines&#13;
 results for similar sanitation options across sites.                                   to private wet pit latrines and from private toilets to septic&#13;

 Shared toilets can also provide improved access for fami-&#13;
 lies, compared with the alternative â&#128;&#147; open defecation.                                    The first two of these reasons suggest that there is little&#13;
 From an economic perspective, shared toilets are also                                     room for improving access to sanitation in urban areas, and&#13;
 economically attractive. In locations where space and                                     that increases in sanitation coverage in rural areas are likely&#13;
 funds are a constraint, these facilities may continue to                                  to have a larger impact at national level. The third reason&#13;

   Estimates made by Hutton et al. (2009) showed that annual costs of poor sanitation in the country amounted to about US$193 million or 5.6% of GDP in&#13;
 2006. Since the estimates were based on sanitation coverage rates for 2006, when only 45% of households had access to improved sanitation, it can be asserted that&#13;
 improvements in sanitation coverage through 2010 mean that the economic impacts could already be significantly lower. While this statement may be true, it is still very&#13;
 likely that the costs are quite large. Estimates in Section 5.3 show that the health-related costs associated with the 2010 sanitation coverage rates were 1,312 billion kip&#13;
 (US$157 million). This is still about 2.4% of 2010 GDP and ignores other impacts included in the study by Hutton et al. (2009).&#13;

These points do not suggest that investment in urban ar-                          of this study can feed into such advocacy efforts, further&#13;

the urban population still does not have access to improved                       tation. Such research could include studies of household&#13;

       resources could in turn translate into a clearer un-&#13;

       recording and compilation of the documents from&#13;
       such projects. This documentation should be lim-&#13;
       ited to project completion reports and also mon-&#13;

       completion.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ In selecting between the specific options, decision&#13;
       makers must be cognizant of the initial conditions&#13;
       of the target beneficiaries. This understanding is es-&#13;
       sential to increasing the success and sustainability of&#13;
       the option chosen. This is supported by the finding&#13;
       of the study that an option could have divergent ef-&#13;
       ficiency indicators in different sites. For example,&#13;
       the BCRs from shared wet pit latrines were found&#13;
       to be higher than for private wet pit latrines in rural&#13;
       areas. However, the reverse was true for urban ar-&#13;
       eas. From the perspective of project implementers,&#13;
       this highlights the need for pre-project assessment.&#13;
       On the other hand, the government can help project&#13;
       implementers by strengthening information systems&#13;
       at potential project sites.&#13;

            Access to improved sanitation is a major
            concern in the Lao People&#146;s Democratic Republic. Only 63
            percent of the population of the country had access to
            improved sanitation facilities in 2010. Sanitation
            conditions are worse in rural areas. This study aims to
            generate evidence on the costs and benefits of sanitation
