     and Asia. In recent years, PE investments have increased rapidly in EMDEs. Reaching US$ 34.7&#13;
     billion in 2014, with emerging Asia leading, followed by Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central&#13;
     and Eastern Europe. Despite tis progress, the PE financing gap in EMDEs is estimated at US$ 270&#13;

     public spending in the scenario with climate change and adaptation as compared to the no climate change scenario, and use the same methodology as has been applied to the other sectors. In&#13;
     WB 2010, the costs were incorrectly reported as reflecting the difference in public spending in the scenario with climate change and adaptation as compared to the scenario with climate change&#13;
     but no adaptation. The difference lowers the EACC lower bound estimate of the global cost of adaptation from US$ 75 billion reported in WB 2010 to US$ 71.2 billion per year, rounded to&#13;

      development (or significant upgrade or renovation) and management of a public&#13;
      asset (including potentially management of a related public service), in which&#13;
      the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility through&#13;
      the life of the contract, provides a significant portion of the finance at its own&#13;

     Rationale for developing domestic investment component of SWFs&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Permanent income hypothesis-&gt; countries should save enough of&#13;

        are higher at home than abroad, or if future generations can be&#13;
        expected to be wealthier than current one, it may be optimal to save&#13;
        less abroad and invest more at home now&#13;

&amp;#12;Program context/description: Pillar III&#13;
â&#128;¢ A number of SWFs have been established since the beginning of the 2000s with&#13;
  the objective to undertake domestic investments in key sectors of the economy:&#13;
  several SWFs in the Gulf, Samruk-Kazyna in Kazakhstand, Kazanah in Malaysia&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ In the last four years, Nigeria and Angola have joined funds with domestic&#13;
  investment function&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ SWFs with a domestic investment function are being discussed in several&#13;
  countries including Bangladesh, Kenya, Myanmar, Mongolia, Mozambique,&#13;
  Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, to be capitalized from revenues of oil and&#13;

&amp;#12;Program context/description: Pillar III&#13;
â&#128;¢    In parallel with increased allocation by oil or mineral-based SWFs to domestic&#13;
     investment, a growing number of EMDEs are establishing Strategic Investment&#13;
     Funds (SIFs) funded through fiscal surpluses, asset transfers and/or borrowing&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    SIFs objective: to act as anchor investor for international and domestic&#13;

     Sub-regional and country engagements&#13;
&#13;
      At the sub-regional and country levels, the Investment Funds Group&#13;
      team supports Regional FM GP and TC GP teams on three business&#13;
      lines: (i) development of PE/VC ecosystems; (ii) development of SWFs&#13;
      in LICs; and (iii) development of SIFs in low and middle-income&#13;
      countries. In each business line, ongoing and planned country&#13;
      engagements are selected on the basis of four fundamental criteria:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Sub-regional/country demand through CMU&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Partnership across WBG (IFC, TRE, GPs, CCSAs)&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Partnership outside WBG (RAS, MDTFs, Multilateral TFs, Bilateral TFs,&#13;
          etc..)&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Line of sight instrument (LSI) towards relevant SDG(s)&#13;

&amp;#12;Program risks&#13;
     The key risk to the program is rapidly growing demand for advisory and project&#13;
     support in the investment funds space vs small size of core Investment Fund&#13;
     Group (IFG) team in Fin4Dev.&#13;
&#13;
     To mitigate this risk, the team is taking the following measures:&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Strengthen the core IFG team through partnerships with senior staff from&#13;
           Governance GP (DA assignment) and Energy and Extractives GP (cross-support)&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Assign country engagement TTLship to Regional FMGP and TCGP colleagues and&#13;
           retain TL and/or co-TTL role only in core IFG team&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Build cross-Group, cross-Practice and cross-CCSA task teams based on&#13;
           engagement technical and operational scope in particular with IFC Funds Group/SME&#13;
           Ventures, TRE, TCGP, SURRGP, Governance GP, Energy and Extractives GP, CC&#13;
           CCSA and PPP CCSA&#13;
       â&#128;¢   Build strong cadre of senior consultant experts in PE/VC, SWF and SIF spaces to&#13;
           contribute to specific advisory and operational engagements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63&#13;
&amp;#12;Roles of clients and partners&#13;
At the global level, critical partnerships are:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor&#13;
       forum for building ownership and for supporting the preparation of the global&#13;
       review of SIFs and the preparation of guidelines for the design of SIFs.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (ISWF), as&#13;
       international standard setter for SWFs governance (Santiago Principles)&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The Emerging Markets Private Equity Association (EMPEA), as co-manager&#13;
       of the PE/VC C4D platform&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The Fletcher Network for Sovereign Wealth and Global Capital (FNSWGC),&#13;
       as co-manager of the SWF C4D platform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64&#13;
&amp;#12;Roles of clients and partners&#13;
At the sub-regional and country level, critical partnerships are:&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), as multi-donor forum for&#13;
         building ownership and funding mobilization for GRIF;&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), as multi-donor forum for&#13;
         building ownership and funding mobilization for the SIF business line&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The FIRST Initiative, as multi-donor forum for building ownership and funding mobilization&#13;
         for the development of PE/VC legal and regulatory frameworks and reforms under the&#13;
         PE/VC business line&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The European Union Commission, as partner and donor for PE/VC development programs&#13;
         in EU candidate countries and in EU Eastern Partnership countries&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The UK Department for International Development (DFID), as partner and donor for the&#13;
         proposed Caribbean Regional Infrastructure PPP Finance Fund (CRIP3F) and for the&#13;
         Kenya SWF/SIF advisory&#13;
     â&#128;¢   The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as partner in the proposed CRIP3F and in the&#13;
         proposed regional diaspora co-investment facility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65&#13;
&amp;#12;Dissemination and outreach strategy&#13;
â&#128;¢ The core of the dissemination and outreach strategy for the investment&#13;
  fund for development program is the Investment Funds for Development&#13;
  Community of Practice (CoP), and its two dedicated C4D platforms co-&#13;
  managed and open to outside stakeholders in the investment funds&#13;
  space (see Section IV.2.1 above).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ In addition, the IFG core team and regional engagement task team&#13;
  leaders and team members will participate actively through speaking and&#13;
  panel engagements in selected international forums and conferences, in&#13;
  particular the IFSWF Annual Meeting, the EMPEA/IFC Annual&#13;
  Conference, and the Fletcher Network Annual Infrastructure Forum.&#13;

            The development objective of the
            Investment Funds for Development (IFD) program is to enable
            EMDE governments and regional economic communities to create
            the conditions to mobilize investment fund resources for
            SMEs and infrastructure finance, with the objective to
            contribute to the achievement of the SDGs of growth and
            employment (SDG8), resilient infrastructure (SDG9), and
            climate adaptation and mitigation (SDG13).
