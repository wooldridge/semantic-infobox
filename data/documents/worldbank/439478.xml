Corporate Debt Restructuring-&#13;
A Proposal for East Asia&#13;
Auctions speak louder than words&#13;
Donald B.        Auctions may be an appropriate way to reorganize the liabilities of some overindebted East Asian&#13;
Hausch and S.    firms-those that are generally well run, for which there is merit in keeping the existing owners in&#13;
Ramizachandrani&#13;
place, but for which conventional bankruptcy procedures are proving too slow. Delays in reducing&#13;
debt can erode the value of firms, to the detriment of both creditors and taxpayers. This Note&#13;
proposes an auction scheme dubbed Accord-for Auction-based Creditor Ordering by Reducing&#13;
Debts. Firms pay creditors in sequence as their operating cash flows permit rather than on a&#13;
promised schedule. Creditors bid for position in the queue by the proportion of debt they forgive,&#13;
choosing between smaller or more deferred repayments. The outcome: a firm with serviceable&#13;
debt, controlled by existing owners with an incentive to operate it efficiently.&#13;

Corporate Debt Restructuring-A  Proposal for East Asia&#13;
While firms may pay only the creditor at the head               assets. An auction protects honest civil servants by&#13;
of the queue, they can raise additional funds by                producing an observable, firm-specific value-the&#13;
selling assets, issuing new  equity, or borrowing               weighted  average of bids-to  use  in  reducing&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Auctions may be an appropriate way to
            reorganize the liabilities of some overindebted East Asian
            firms - those that are generally well run, for which there
            is merit in keeping the existing owners in place, but for
            which conventional bankruptcy procedures are proving too
            slow. This Note proposes an auction scheme dubbed Accord -
            for Auction-based Creditor Ordering by Reducing Debts. Firms
            pay creditors in sequence as their operating cash flows
            permit rather than on a promised schedule. Creditors bid for
            position in the queue by the proportion of debt they
            forgive, choosing between smaller or more deferred
            repayments. The outcome: a firm with serviceable debt,
            controlled by existing owners with an incentive to operate
            it efficiently.
