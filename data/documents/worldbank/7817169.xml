                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
        The analysis in this report, based on participants from 25 of WBI's focus&#13;
countries over five fiscal years, shows that WBI's learning programs improved&#13;
significantly, particularly in FY05. WBI's learning activities became more effective&#13;
and demonstrated higher impact over time.&#13;
&#13;
        Programs utilizing a country-applicable approach to pedagogy were deemed&#13;
highly effective compared with activities that were not perceived to be relevant to&#13;
participants' countries. Tailoring content to participants' countries increased learning&#13;
program effectiveness. Likewise, developing action plans that clients can relate to their&#13;
work and country also enhanced the effectiveness of WBI's learning programs in focus&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
        Learning activities were most effective among certain groups. Participants from&#13;
low-income countries rated WBI's programs significantly more effective than&#13;
respondents from lower middle-income countries. Likewise, impact was significantly&#13;
more likely to occur among participants from low-income countries in all areas than in&#13;
lower-middle income countries. Although these results mirror previous findings that&#13;
WBI has increased its focus on poorer areas (Quizon et al. 2005), the magnitude of the&#13;
effect is small with limited practical consequences.&#13;
&#13;
        WBI's learning programs in focus countries were particularly effective among&#13;
government clients. Government employees rated WBI as significantly more effective&#13;
than respondents from other sectors, such as nongovernmental organizations. Also, not&#13;
surprisingly, respondents who considered themselves highly proficient in the language&#13;
of instruction found the activity to be more effective than respondents who felt they&#13;
were lacking proficiency. Impact was greatest among high-level officials. High-level&#13;
officials were more likely than middle or junior-level respondents to use what they&#13;
learned overall, and particularly in operational work.&#13;

                                        INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Past analyses of WBI's learning programs have explored the determinants of&#13;
WBI's effectiveness and impact as a function of the Institute's learning activities and the&#13;
participants who attended them (Quizon et al. 2005; Khattri et al. 2002). The previous&#13;
studies documented the importance of key activity features such as utilizing action plans&#13;
and country-relevant content in the effectiveness of WBI's programs. Likewise, the&#13;
significance of participant characteristics (e.g., being in high-level positions and from&#13;
low-income countries) were related to participants' subsequent utilization of their&#13;
acquired skills and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Moreover, an analysis (Quizon et al. 2005) based on participants from 12 focus&#13;
countries between FY01 and FY03 suggested that improvement among the more recent&#13;
activities may have occurred. However, given the limited time period under study, it was&#13;
not feasible to determine whether any trends existed.&#13;
&#13;
Study objectives&#13;
&#13;
3.       The current work tests whether WBI's learning program effectiveness and impact&#13;
changed over time in WBI's focus countries.1 This study is based on a regionally diverse&#13;
sample with five time points, FY01-FY05. Thus, the study allows exploration of the&#13;
relationships between activity and participant characteristics and WBI effectiveness and&#13;
impact over time. This study addresses three questions: (a) Has the impact of WBI's&#13;
learning programs changed over time? (b) What aspects of WBI activities enhance WBI's&#13;
effectiveness? and (c) Where did WBI's learning programs have the largest impact and,&#13;
among which participants did WBI succeed in providing learning that was later applied?&#13;
&#13;
Data and limitations&#13;
&#13;
4.       Within the 25 countries, the respondent sample includes data from participants&#13;
who attended WBI learning events in FY01, 02, 03, 04, and 05. Surveys were&#13;
administered to a random sample of respondents eight to 22 months after their attendance&#13;
in FY03, 04, 05, and 06. Sampling was based on a random selection of participants&#13;
within target countries.2 The final sample was dependent on: the nature of the data&#13;
collection process in countries over time; budget constraints (i.e., resources to select&#13;
&#13;
1WBI's other capacity-building functions and services, such as technical assistance and research and&#13;
knowledge-generation work, are beyond the span of this study.&#13;
2Target countries were selected based on the following criteria: (a) whether they were a focus country at&#13;
the time of data collection; (b) the total number of participants with contact information (target number of&#13;
respondents was 200); and (c) regional representation (obtaining coverage from all the regions).&#13;
&#13;
                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
certain countries instead of the entire population); and limitations of WBI's Client&#13;
Registration System (CRS) for maintaining current contact information for participants.&#13;
Consequently, the number of respondents in each fiscal year varied. Further, within a&#13;
given fiscal year, the countries in the sample do not represent both low-income and&#13;
lower-middle income countries.&#13;
&#13;
5.      In the first stage, WBIEG collected data in five lower middle-income countries:&#13;
Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. In the second stage, the questionnaire&#13;
was condensed and sharpened based on experience in the previous year (appendices A&#13;
and B). WBIEG conducted country-focus evaluations in seven low-income countries:&#13;
Burkina Faso, Guatemala, Kenya, Indonesia, Nigeria, Tajikistan, and Yemen. In the third&#13;
stage, data were collected in a combination of low- and lower middle-income countries:&#13;
Bolivia, China, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, and Vietnam.&#13;
Most recently, in the fourth stage, WBIEG collected data in the Philippines, Senegal, and&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Table 1 summarizes the sample by country. The second and third columns&#13;
illustrate the fiscal year of the activity that participants attended and the year in which&#13;
they were surveyed. The next two columns show the total number of respondents from&#13;
the country and the number of activities they attended. The final column shows the&#13;
cooperation rate, which is an adjusted response rate indicating the proportion who&#13;
responded out of those who were able to be contacted.&#13;
&#13;
7.      WBIEG hired local consultants to survey WBI alumni. Respondents were&#13;
randomly selected based on data in the CRS. Much of the contact information for&#13;
participants was not current because the activity they attended occurred months prior to&#13;
the evaluation survey. Thus, consultants were often required to locate participants using&#13;
inaccurate information. Therefore, in addition to the target participant list, WBIEG&#13;
provided consultants with a list of replacement names and instructions to contact them&#13;
only after exhausting all possible methods of reaching individuals on the original target&#13;
list. The rate of cooperation depended on the competency and perseverance of the&#13;
consultant as well as the local conditions in which they worked (i.e., infrastructure,&#13;
geographic limitations). The average survey cooperation rate was 66 percent.&#13;

&#13;
    aDifferences with previous reports reflect updates in the CRS because participant data were merged&#13;
    with the most current CRS database at the time of analysis.&#13;
    bThe cooperation rate is the number of completed surveys divided by the number of contactable&#13;
    respondents (excluding participants for whom the contact information was not valid and could not be&#13;
    traced, but including those who were contacted but refused to cooperate).&#13;
&#13;
8.      The sample potentially suffers from selection bias because it is based solely on&#13;
participants for whom contact information is recorded. Such bias would likely occur only&#13;
if there is a systematic element discriminating between respondents for whom&#13;
information exists and those for whom it does not. The assumption is that the missing&#13;
data problem is random. If bias exists, WBIEG assumes that it exists similarly across&#13;
time and countries, and therefore does not affect key results regarding fiscal year and&#13;
country income level, although it would prevent generalizations to the full population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.      The second potential area of bias involves the correlation between time (fiscal&#13;
year), country conditions, and income level.3 The effects of time and income status could&#13;
be confounded with country conditions related to factors influencing WBI's effectiveness&#13;
and impact. To correct for these concerns, WBIEG used estimated values based on&#13;
multivariate models that consider time and countries' income levels.&#13;
&#13;
10.     A third possible limitation is that the report's unit of analysis is the individual.&#13;
One school of thought argues that for capacity building to have an impact it can be&#13;
measured only at the organizational level. The assumption in this report (and in the series&#13;
of impact studies published by WBIEG) is that individual-level impact is a prerequisite to&#13;
impact at higher levels. In other words, capacity-building takes place at three levels: the&#13;
individual, organizational, and institutional levels.&#13;
&#13;
11.     In this analysis, WBIEG examined impact from the perspective of individuals&#13;
within organizations. Impact is operationalized at the individual level as the success WBI&#13;
had in arming participants with knowledge, skills, and strategies to apply within the&#13;
organizations to which they belong. Thus, critics have argued that respondents may&#13;
apply what they have learned every day and still not have an impact on the organization&#13;
in which they work. While this may be true, the converse is not. Change at the&#13;
organizational level can take place only if individuals within the organization initiate it.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Specifically, impact is defined as the reported frequency with which participants&#13;
utilized their acquired knowledge within eight to 22 months after the activity's&#13;
completion. The lag between the intervention and the evaluation is critical to allow&#13;
sufficient time for impact to occur. In other words, participants must have the opportunity&#13;
to utilize what they learned. Thus, clients were also asked to rate how frequently they&#13;
applied and used their acquired skills in:&#13;
&#13;
        Â·       Raising public awareness in development issues, teaching, and research,&#13;
        Â·       Organizing collective initiatives,&#13;
        Â·       Implementing new practices within participants' work organizations,&#13;

&#13;
13.     Country baseline indicators measuring WBI's relevance, effectiveness, and&#13;
impact were developed for each of the 25 countries, and for WBI overall from FY01 to&#13;
FY05.4 The surveys asked participants to rate the relevance of the activity to their&#13;
country's needs as well as WBI's effectiveness in:&#13;
&#13;
        Â·       Raising their awareness and understanding of development issues&#13;
                important to their country,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3The sample of activities taking place in FY01 includes data collected primarily from lower middle-income&#13;
country respondents. In contrast, the data for FY05 events includes respondents solely from low-income&#13;
countries.&#13;

Model of WBI's program effectiveness and impact&#13;
&#13;
14.      Previous studies (Quizon et al. 2005, 2004) show that for WBI to have an impact,&#13;
it is first necessary for its programs to be rated as effective when participant selection is&#13;
targeted and country conditions are conducive to change. Figure 1 illustrates a system of&#13;
equations that captures the effects of WBI's activity features, participant characteristics,&#13;
and country factors in predicting WBI's effectiveness and impact. (See appendix C for a&#13;
description of key variables and summary statistics.)&#13;

&#13;
15.      This model assumes that effectiveness is a necessary, but not sufficient condition&#13;
for development impact. This model thus explores the conditions and catalysts necessary&#13;
for effectiveness to translate into impact by using a two-stage model predicting&#13;
effectiveness in the first stage and impact in the second stage.&#13;
&#13;
16.      The analysis examines WBI's effectiveness in three areas separately: (a) raising&#13;
awareness, (b) building skills or knowledge, and (c) providing strategies and approaches&#13;
for development at the organizational and country level. The analysis also examines&#13;
overall effectiveness, as a composite measure comprised of effectiveness in three areas.5&#13;
&#13;
5Overall effectiveness is the average score for the three key dimensions of effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The model attempts to predict overall effectiveness and the various dimensions of&#13;
effectiveness separately as a function of participant characteristics, activity features, and&#13;
exogenous factors such as a country's economic status. The results show that each of the&#13;
models predicting WBI's effectiveness fare well, especially given the measurement error&#13;
associated with survey data (table C3).6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
WBI's learning program effectiveness in focus countries&#13;
&#13;
17.      In reviewing the summary statistics, it is important to keep in mind that the data&#13;
are based on a series of evaluations conducted over multiple years. As a result, there is a&#13;
correlation between time (fiscal year), country conditions, and country income level. The&#13;
sample for activities taking place in FY01 includes data collected from respondents in&#13;
Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, all of which are classified as middle-&#13;
income countries. In contrast, the data for FY05 events includes respondents primarily&#13;
from low-income countries: Senegal, Tanzania, and Philippines. As a result, the effects of&#13;
time and country income status can be confounded with country conditions related to&#13;
factors influencing WBI's effectiveness and impact. To correct for these issues, WBIEG&#13;
used estimated values based on models that control for country income level and fiscal&#13;
year as well as activity and participant characteristics. The model results indicate that the&#13;
effectiveness of WBI's learning programs increased significantly between FY01 and&#13;
FY05.7&#13;
&#13;
18.      Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the actual and estimated annual average ratings for&#13;
overall effectiveness, raising awareness and understanding of development issues,&#13;
building knowledge or skills, and providing strategies and approaches for addressing&#13;
organizational and country needs.8 Respondents' ratings were provided on a 7-point&#13;
scale where 1 = "not effective at all," and 7 = "extremely effective."&#13;
&#13;
19.      WBI's learning programs in focus countries became more effective over&#13;
time. The finding is consistent across all dimensions of effectiveness. Overall&#13;
effectiveness, at least in the opinions of participants, increased by 16 percent in FY05&#13;
compared with FY01. The increase was 14 percent for raising awareness, 19 percent for&#13;
skills and knowledge, and 13 percent for providing strategies and approaches. The&#13;
differences were calculated using simulations based on the multivariate regression model&#13;
to control for time and country income level.9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6The overall model of effectiveness was the most precise with an R2 of .29. The models predicting raising&#13;
awareness, skills or knowledge, and strategy were strong with R2 of .22, .20, and .21, respectively.&#13;
7Table C3 illustrates the results for the model predicting WBI's effectiveness across the fiscal years under&#13;
study.&#13;
8Estimated values are based on simulations setting country income level to low for all countries in the&#13;
sample (see appendix C for details.)&#13;
9Rather than comparing the raw averages, or simply interpreting the beta coefficients from the model&#13;
results to illustrate the effects of time, WBIEG used the model to calculate effectiveness ratings in the&#13;

respective fiscal years, while holding constant other explanatory factors such as activity features,&#13;
participant characteristics, and country income. The simulated values are based on the regression model&#13;
presented in table C3 and were calculated by holding all variables constant at the mean for a given time&#13;
period, i.e., FY05 and FY01. The percentage increases are the difference between the predicted values for&#13;
FY05 and FY01. Comparing the simulated effectiveness ratings is superior to comparing the raw averages&#13;
because the estimates control for country income and other key variables influencing effectiveness ratings.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.      The analysis uncovered the key factors in WBI's learning programs that improved&#13;
effectiveness. To test the robustness of the findings, WBIEG developed regressions&#13;
predicting overall effectiveness separately by fiscal year.10 The results confirmed the&#13;
consistency and the importance of the key activity characteristics Â­ country relevance and&#13;
action plans Â­ reflected in previous studies (Quizon et al. 2005). In other words, the&#13;
results point to lessons about how to improve learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
WBI's learning program relevance to country needs in focus countries&#13;
&#13;
21.      The increase in the effectiveness of WBI's learning programs over time can be&#13;
explained in large part by the increase in WBI's relevance to participants' country&#13;
needs in focus countries. Relevance was rated on a 7-point scale from 1, "not relevant at&#13;
all" to 7, "extremely relevant." Figure 3 presents the average annual relevance ratings by&#13;
fiscal year and depicts a substantial improvement in WBI's relevance to participants'&#13;
specific country needs. A multivariate regression analysis controlling for country income&#13;
confirmed the statistical significance (p&lt;.0001) of the increases in relevance ratings in&#13;
FY05 (10 percent), FY04 (6 percent), FY03 (6 percent), and FY02 (6 percent) compared&#13;
with FY01 (see table C4).&#13;
&#13;
22.      Activities with learning content tailored to participants' countries enhanced&#13;
WBI's effectiveness in raising awareness, building skills or knowledge, and&#13;
providing strategies and approaches. According to the model's results, activities that&#13;
were rated as highly relevant to participants' country needs were more effective (by 35&#13;
percent) than those that were not perceived to be relevant at all.11 In fact, relevance to&#13;
participants' country needs was a key factor in explaining each of the dimensions of&#13;
effectiveness. Activities that were rated highly relevant to the country (compared with&#13;
those that were not relevant at all) were more effective in raising participants' awareness&#13;
of development issues (41 percent), building skills and knowledge (35 percent), and&#13;
providing strategies and approaches for addressing organizational and country needs (34&#13;
percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10Table C5 illustrates the results for FY02, FY03, and FY04, years in which low- and middle-income level&#13;
countries were represented.&#13;
11The effect of relevance (beta coefficient =.35) can be interpreted as a 35 percent increase in effectiveness&#13;
when all other variable are held constant because both the independent variable and the dependent variable&#13;
range between zero and 1. The values for all survey items were recalibrated between zero (e.g., "not&#13;
effective at all") and 1 (e.g., "extremely effective.")&#13;

&#13;
Enhancing activity effectiveness through applying pedagogy&#13;
&#13;
23.      The increase in the effectiveness of WBI's learning programs in focus countries&#13;
was also due to WBI's increased use of action plans. Action plans are work plans,&#13;
strategy papers, or policy documents that allow participants to apply the skills and&#13;
knowledge they learned in the activity.12 Confirming findings from previous studies&#13;
(Quizon et al. 2005; Quizon, Ling, and Lockheed 2004; Khattri et al. 2002), the key&#13;
pedagogical variable predicting WBI's effectiveness was participants' use of action plans&#13;
during a learning event. As illustrated in figure 4, the proportion of respondents reporting&#13;
that they developed an action plan increased between FY01 (24 percent) and FY05 (39&#13;
percent). In addition, developing strategies and plans to use in participants' organizations&#13;
was an instrumental tool enhancing the effectiveness of the activity in all areas:&#13;
developing strategies and approaches (6 percent); building skills and knowledge (6&#13;
percent); and raising awareness (5 percent). The use of action plans improved WBI's&#13;
overall effectiveness by 6 percent.13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12Respondents were asked the following question: "During the learning activity, did you develop an action&#13;
plan/strategy (e.g., work plans, strategy papers, policy documents, assessment of country needs assessment&#13;
of sectoral needs) to apply the new ideas you learned?"&#13;
13The effect of action plan is consistent across all dimensions of effectiveness. When respondents reported&#13;
using action plans in the activity they attended, they rated activity effectiveness 6 percent higher, on&#13;
average.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       9&#13;

24.     WBI's Participants from low-income countries rated WBI's effectiveness&#13;
slightly higher than participants from lower middle-income countries (by 2.5&#13;
percent). In examining the various dimensions of effectiveness separately, WBIEG&#13;
discovered that WBI's overall effectiveness in low-income countries was driven mostly&#13;
by its effectiveness in raising participants' awareness of development issues. Participants&#13;
from low-income countries were more likely than participants from lower middle-income&#13;
countries to rate WBI as effective in raising awareness (by 3.5 percent). The results from&#13;
running the models independently by fiscal year showed that respondents from low-&#13;
income countries rated WBI's effectiveness in raising awareness higher than respondents&#13;
from lower middle-income countries (see table C5).&#13;
&#13;
25.     WBI's learning programs were more effective among participants affiliated&#13;
with governments as opposed to other types of organizations. WBI activities were 2&#13;
percent more effective among participants from government organizations compared with&#13;
other organizations in the private sector, NGOs, and the media. This was true&#13;
particularly in knowledge building and development strategies. No differences existed in&#13;
terms of WBI's effectiveness in raising awareness.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Participants' self-reported levels of proficiency in the language of instruction&#13;
were significantly related to WBI's effectiveness. Participants who rated themselves as&#13;
highly proficient were 5 percent more likely to assess the activity as effective overall than&#13;
respondents who did not rate themselves as highly proficient. Likewise, highly proficient&#13;
respondents were also 6 percent more likely to rate the activity as effective in providing&#13;
development strategies.&#13;
&#13;
27.     The increase in the perceived effectiveness of WBI's learning programs was&#13;
mirrored by an increase in self-assessments of proficiency in the language of instruction.&#13;
Figure 5 illustrates an increase in participants' average self-ratings of proficiency in the&#13;

language of instruction between FY01 and FY05. As WBI attracted participants with&#13;
stronger skills in the language of instruction, WBI's events became more effective.&#13;

28.      The mode of delivering an activity was related to WBI's effectiveness in&#13;
developing strategies and approaches but not to other areas of effectiveness. Face-to-&#13;
face events were especially effective in developing strategies and approaches. Activities&#13;
using videoconferences that did not include a blended component were rated as less&#13;
effective than activities delivered face to face in terms of developing strategies and&#13;
approaches (by 3 percent).&#13;
&#13;
29.      Delivery mode did not influence WBI's effectiveness in the areas of raising&#13;
awareness and knowledge building. Face-to-face activities were not more effective than&#13;
distance learning events in raising awareness and knowledge building.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Participants' in high-level positions were more likely than those in less senior&#13;
positions to apply what they learned to create development strategies. Respondents&#13;
in high level positions were 3 percent more likely to report utilization of WBI-acquired&#13;
skills and knowledge in creating development strategies for their organizations and&#13;
country. This result is intuitive because junior-level respondents are not likely to work&#13;
on developing strategies for their organizations. No differences existed between high-&#13;
and junior-level respondents in effectiveness in raising awareness and building their skills&#13;
and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Factors unrelated to effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
31.      Activity location did not affect WBI's effectiveness. Activities held solely for&#13;
participants from the country were not deemed more effective than activities in other&#13;
countries. This was surprising because activities in participants' countries were loosely&#13;
defined as reflecting a country-focused approach. In other words, events that were held&#13;
for participants from several countries were expected to be more general in content and&#13;
therefore less applicable to participants' specific country situations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.      There were some differences in effectiveness between learning providers&#13;
within WBI (figure 6). For example, WBIKD was less effective than WBIEN in overall&#13;
effectiveness and development strategies. One possible explanation is that a key&#13;
pedagogical tool for activity effectiveness, action planning, was not used as frequently in&#13;
WBIKD's activities compared with WBIEN events.14 WBIPR's events were rated higher&#13;
than WBIEN's in knowledge building. This may be due to activity content in that&#13;
participants in WBIPR's activities were rated higher than WBIEN's activities in&#13;
relevance to their country needs.15&#13;

&#13;
The perceived impact of WBI's learning programs&#13;
&#13;
33.      Based on the assumption that impact would occur only if WBI activities were&#13;
effective, impact was operationalized as participants' use of skills and knowledge&#13;
acquired at WBI events. The key explanatory variables included predicted overall&#13;
effectiveness (from the first-stage equation), respondent characteristics, and activity&#13;
features. Table C6 presents the results from the second-stage regression predicting overall&#13;
utilization, and its two components, academic and operational use. Utilization was&#13;
measured as participants' ratings of how frequently they used the skills and knowledge&#13;
they acquired on a 7-point scale, where 1 = not at all, and 7 = very often. Figures 7a and&#13;
7b illustrate the actual and estimated average ratings.16&#13;
&#13;
34.      Participants' overall use of WBI-acquired skills and knowledge increased&#13;
significantly over time. Between FY01 and FY05, overall usefulness increased by 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14Thirty-two percent of respondents reported developing action plans in WBIKD's events compared with&#13;
47 percent of respondents in WBIEN's events.&#13;
15The average rating of relevance to country needs was 5.67 among respondents in WBIPR activities&#13;
versus 5.32 among respondents in WBIEN events.&#13;
16The estimated values for use of WBI-acquired skills and knowledge for FY01 and FY05 are based on the&#13;
model controlling for country income, participant characteristics, and activity factors in table C6.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
percent.17 This was true for both academic and operational use. Academic use includes&#13;
research, teaching, and raising awareness. Operational use includes the implementation of&#13;
country development strategies and new practices within work organizations, influencing&#13;
legislation and regulation, and organizing collective initiatives. WBI's impact was larger&#13;
in areas related to academe than in operational uses. Impact in both areas increased over&#13;
time. Academic use was 28 percent higher in FY05 than in FY01. Likewise, operational&#13;
use was 32 percent higher in FY05 than in FY01.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
17The percentage increase is based on robust findings presented in the model in table C6 and the simulated&#13;
percentage change between FY01 and FY05 in overall use. The difference between the two is significant at&#13;
the p&lt;.01 level.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35.     Activity effectiveness increased participants' use of skills and knowledge&#13;
acquired from WBI events they attended. As demonstrated in previous studies,&#13;
predicted overall effectiveness was the most important and significant variable in&#13;
explaining overall usefulness, knowledge building, and operational usefulness (Quizon et&#13;
al. 2005; Quizon, Ling and Lockheed 2004; Ling and Arango 2004, Quizon 2004; and&#13;
Quizon and Ling 2003). Perceived activity effectiveness (estimated from stage 1)&#13;
explained nearly three quarters of the variation (74 percent) in participants' use of the&#13;
skills and knowledge acquired at WBI events. As expected, the more effective&#13;
participants rated WBI programs, the more likely and more frequently they were to use&#13;
what they learned from WBI.&#13;
&#13;
36.     WBI had a stronger impact among participants from low-income countries&#13;
than respondents from lower-middle income countries. Respondents from low-&#13;
income countries more frequently utilized their WBI-acquired skills and knowledge in all&#13;
areas: overall, academic, and operational use, compared with respondents from lower-&#13;
middle income countries. However, the magnitude of the effect was small (1 percent)&#13;
compared with WBI effectiveness, the primary explanatory variable in the model. In&#13;
other words, although the effect of low-income country is statistically significant, the&#13;
practical consequences are limited.&#13;
&#13;
37.     Participants in high-level positions were more likely than those in middle and&#13;
junior-level positions to utilize WBI acquired skills and knowledge in operational&#13;
work. Confirming previously reported findings (Quizon et al. 2005), participants in&#13;
high-level positions were 5 percent more likely than those in middle and junior-level&#13;
positions to apply the knowledge they obtained from WBI overall. High-level&#13;
professionals were particularly likely to use what they learned in operations: organizing&#13;
collective initiatives, implementing new practices within their work organization,&#13;
influencing legislation and regulations, and implementing country development&#13;
strategies. No differences existed according to professional level in participants' use of&#13;
skills and knowledge in the academic areas, including research, teaching, and raising&#13;
public awareness about development issues.&#13;
&#13;
38.     The impact of WBI's learning programs in focus countries in FY05 was&#13;
significantly greater than in FY01. Participants were significantly more likely to report&#13;
using what they learned in FY05 compared with participants in FY01 in all areas of&#13;
impact: overall use, academic use, and operational use. The comparison between FY05&#13;
(after the introduction of the country-focus approach) and FY01 (before that approach),&#13;
suggests the possibility of WBI's country-focus approach having begun to have an impact&#13;
on the ground. Given that WBI's Regional Coordination Team (RCT) did not begin&#13;
implementing country-focus initiatives until FY04, it is surprising to see potential&#13;
indications of improvement already in FY05. It is important not to draw any definitive&#13;
conclusions from the positive effect of the FY05 variable, however, because this effect&#13;
captures all the unmeasured attributes that may have improved with time but are not in&#13;
the regression model (e.g., better targeting and improved program content.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                  CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
39.     This comprehensive evaluation of the World Bank Institute's FY01-FY05&#13;
learning programs for participants from 25 focus countries demonstrates significant&#13;
improvement over time. WBI's learning programs in focus countries have become more&#13;
effective and demonstrated greater impact over the years, especially in FY05. This&#13;
suggests that shortly after the launch of WBI's country-focus approach, significant&#13;
improvements in WBI's learning programs began to surface. Although the RCT was&#13;
established in FY03, and did not begin implementing CF policies until FY04, there is&#13;
already evidence of results in FY05 compared with FY01 (before WBI's country focus&#13;
approach was developed).&#13;
&#13;
40.     Utilizing a country-focused approach in pedagogy also improved program&#13;
effectiveness. Activities with learning content tailored to the target audience's countries&#13;
were effective in raising participants' awareness, building their skills and knowledge, and&#13;
providing them with new strategies and approaches to address the needs of their countries&#13;
and organizations.&#13;
&#13;
41.     In addition to focusing on participants' country needs, WBI targeted some high-&#13;
level officials from low-income countries. WBI's learning programs were most effective,&#13;
and had the largest impact among participants from low-income countries. Impact was&#13;
greatest among high level officials conducting operational work such as organizing&#13;
collective initiatives, implementing new practices in work organizations, influencing&#13;
legislation and regulation, and building country development strategies.&#13;

     Explanation of simulation methodology used for comparing effectiveness and&#13;
                                      impact in FY01 and FY05&#13;
&#13;
Potential bias: There is a potential bias in comparing data in FY01 and FY05 without&#13;
controlling for country income level differences. The problem is that in FY01 data exist&#13;
primarily for participants from middle-income countries, and in FY05 data exist solely&#13;
for participants from low-income countries. A direct comparison of the raw averages in&#13;
the two years would not tell us whether the effect is due to country income level&#13;
differences or time. The challenge in comparing the two fiscal years is that we need to&#13;
parcel out the effects of country income level.&#13;
&#13;
Solution: The report makes comparisons between FY01 and FY05 based on the values&#13;
simulated by the regression model utilizing the entire sample of respondent data,&#13;
controlling for a variety of factors related to effectiveness and impact including activity&#13;
and participant characteristics and country GNI.&#13;
&#13;
Methodology: We use the power from the model based on all the data to estimate what&#13;
the effectiveness ratings would be if we had data in all countries.&#13;
&#13;
We simulated the relationship between country income on the one hand and effectiveness&#13;
and utilization ratings on the other, based on the model holding all variables constant.&#13;
Using the regression results in Table C3 we calculated estimated mean ratings of&#13;
effectiveness and utilization, based on the entire database of participant responses&#13;
between FY01-FY05.          19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Based on these estimated values, we calculated the percentage change. After comparing&#13;
the percentage change at the various levels simulated for country-income level, we used&#13;
the most conservative estimate of change which was when country income level was set&#13;
to low income status.&#13;
&#13;
The advantage to using this approach is that it takes into account the relationship of the&#13;
variables across all years of data. Therefore, we can draw conclusions and make&#13;
generalizations about effectiveness and utilization in FY01 and FY05.&#13;

19 Technically, this means we use the coefficients from the full model to calculate estimated values for&#13;
effectiveness and utilization, holding country income level and other variables constant. The coefficients&#13;
used in the calculations are general values that are not based on any specific fiscal year; they are the result&#13;
of 5 years of data that capture the overall relationship between the dependent and independent variables&#13;
over the 5 year duration.&#13;

            The effectiveness and impact of WBI FY01-05
            activities : results from 25 focus countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The current work tests whether
            WBI's learning program effectiveness and impact changed
            over time in WBI's focus countries. This study is based
            on a regionally diverse sample with five time points,
            FY01-FY05.  Thus, the study allows exploration of the
            relationships between activity and participant
            characteristics and WBI effectiveness and impact over time.
            This study addresses three questions: (a) Has the impact of
            WBI's learning programs changed over time; (b) What
            aspects of WBI activities enhance WBI's effectiveness;
            and (c) Where did WBI's learning programs have the
            largest impact and, among which participants did WBI succeed
            in providing learning that was later applied. Within the 25
            countries, the respondent sample includes data from
            participants who attended WBI learning events in FY01, 02,
            03, 04, and 05. Surveys were administered to a random sample
            of respondents eight to 22 months after their attendance in
            FY03, 04, 05, and 06.  Sampling was based on a random
            selection of participants within target countries.
