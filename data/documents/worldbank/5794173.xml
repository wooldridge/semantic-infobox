                                                FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
Hygiene is essential to the public health mission of reducing the transmission and consequences of disease. The sharp&#13;
decline in deaths from infectious diseases observed in wealthy countries last century could not have been achieved&#13;
without vastly improved public hygiene. Raising living standards allowed people to become more hygienic once clean&#13;
water was piped into their homes, and soap became cheap enough to put at every sink. Eventually, the collective efforts&#13;
of both the public health movement and private industry ensured that clean hands, clean homes, and clean lives,&#13;
became a social norm.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, the story in poor countries could not be more different. By the end of the 20th century, two billion&#13;
people still had inadequate access to sanitation, and one billion were without enough clean water to drink. Efforts at&#13;
promoting effective hygiene have been piecemeal and ineffective. Though industry has succeeded in getting soap into&#13;
almost every home, it has not consistently promoted good hygiene or handwashing to accompany their products.&#13;
&#13;
This is a missed opportunity for public health. The two biggest killers of children in the developing world today are&#13;
diarrheal disease and respiratory tract infections. The simple act of washing hands with soap can cut diarrhea risk by&#13;
almost half, and respiratory tract infection by a third. This makes handwashing a better option for disease prevention&#13;
than any single vaccine.&#13;
&#13;
If developing countries are to achieve their 2015 millennium development targets for reductions in child mortality, this&#13;
unfinished agenda of the 20th century must be completed. Not only must water and sanitation become universal, but&#13;
so must the habit of handwashing with soap. This requires Ministries of Health, Education, and Water, in addition to&#13;
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based groups, to exploit every opportunity to promote&#13;
handwashing with soap.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, private industry, which played such a large part in creating standards of good hygiene in rich countries, can do&#13;
the same as it expands its business in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Handwashing with soap can and must become commonplace in developing countries. To do this we have to:&#13;
&#13;
! Make sure everyone knows the importance of handwashing&#13;
&#13;
! Build alliances between the public and the private sectors&#13;
&#13;
! Mobilize the necessary resources and expertise&#13;
&#13;
! Use proven high-impact communications outreach to promote handwashing to a mass audience&#13;
&#13;
! Demonstrate that measurable changes in behavior can be achieved cost-effectively.&#13;
&#13;
In a noisy world of competing messages aimed at people from all directions, only the most effective,&#13;
best-designed campaigns will lead to behavior change. This handbook seeks to meet this challenge.&#13;
&#13;
It describes a new approach to handwashing promotion, building on the pioneering work of the&#13;
Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. It explains how the latest thinking in industrial marketing can be&#13;
combined with the latest research in public health to provide powerful new insights to drive effective handwashing&#13;
campaigns. It offers lessons from national programs in Ghana, Peru, Senegal, and other countries. Early indicators&#13;
suggest that this may be the start of an exciting new field in public health in the 21st century.&#13;

                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Handwashing is one of the most effective means of preventing diarrheal diseases, along with safe stool disposal and safe and adequate&#13;
household water supply. Evidence suggests that improved handwashing can have a major impact on public health in any country and&#13;
significantly reduce the two leading causes of childhood mortality ¬≠ diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection. Because&#13;
handwashing with soap can prevent the transmission of a variety of pathogens, it may be more effective than any single vaccine or&#13;
hygiene behavior. Promoted broadly enough, handwashing with soap can be viewed as an essential do-it-yourself vaccine. Almost&#13;
every household in the world, regardless of economic status, has soap. Handwashing with soap at key times, however, is not widely&#13;
practiced. If the millennium development targets for reduction in child mortality are to be met, handwashing habits must be improved&#13;
along with access to safe water and sanitation.&#13;
The Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing has brought together various organizations and sectors to promote&#13;
handwashing with soap on a large scale. The partnership includes:&#13;
! governments who, by prioritizing hygiene, enable handwashing to move from piecemeal, village-by-village, efforts to national&#13;
programs;&#13;
! donor organizations who increasingly include handwashing in their water, sanitation, health, and education programs;&#13;
! the private sector which has brought state-of-the art marketing knowledge and techniques to the table;&#13;
! academic and scientific organizations who are contributing the latest behavior change theory and scientific evidence of the&#13;
effectiveness of handwashing; and&#13;
! non-governmental and community-based organizations who are aiming to integrate handwashing messages into their own&#13;
work programs.&#13;
The Handwashing Handbook lays out the experiences of this global partnership in a practical guide. While countries are still&#13;
optimizing and experimenting with approaches, it is important to disseminate what is currently known. This way others can begin&#13;
designing programs and contributing to the global body of knowledge and experience in the fight against child mortality. This guide&#13;
is for staff in governments and development organizations charged with carrying out handwashing programs. Decision makers in&#13;
ministries and funding agencies will also find assistance in this book for designing policies and programs to improve public health.&#13;
The approach to large-scale handwashing promotion covers the following components:&#13;
Laying the Foundation for a National Handwashing Program&#13;
To be successful, handwashing programs must address a recognized health need and have the support of key stakeholders.&#13;
Government, industry, and donors can all offer unique resources which are necessary to ensure the success of a large-scale&#13;
program. Conducting a situation assessment and, where needed, making the case for handwashing on topics ranging from cost-&#13;
effectiveness to health impact will give the handwashing program a solid foundation.&#13;
Understanding the Consumer&#13;
In order to change long-held habits related to behaviors such as handwashing, a firm understanding of the factors the drive and&#13;
facilitate behaviors in target consumers must be established. This means putting the needs of the target audience ¬≠ primarily&#13;
mothers and caretakers of children under five years old as well as school-aged children ¬≠ at the center and having their perspective&#13;
determine the nature and scope of all promotion activities. Carrying out consumer research provides a baseline for measurement&#13;
and understanding of the target audience by answering four broad questions: What are the risk practices? Who carries out the risk&#13;
practices? What drivers, habits, and/or environmental factors can change behavior? How do people communicate?&#13;
Program Implementation&#13;
The results of consumer research drive program implementation including which environmental factors related to handwashing&#13;
need to be addressed, what is the most appropriate and appealing way to promote handwashing, and what is best mix of&#13;
communication channels to reach the target audience. Implementation also includes the careful monitoring of the program and&#13;
periodic evaluation and adjustment.&#13;
Program Organization&#13;
When partners from different backgrounds and sectors are not accustomed to working together, establishing common aims and&#13;
trust takes time and effort. Placing a program coordinator in a trusted organization is an effective approach to steering diverse&#13;
partners towards a common objective.&#13;
Throughout the handbook, references, case study information, and tools are provided to support handwashing programs. Users&#13;
are encouraged to combine their creativity with existing knowledge in order to innovate and optimize approaches to large-scale&#13;
handwashing promotion.&#13;

                                             INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Purpose of This Handbook&#13;
This handbook grows out of the experience of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap&#13;
(PPPHW) and its predecessor, the Central American Handwashing for Diarrheal Disease Prevention Program. These&#13;
efforts demonstrated that mass programs with public and private sector involvement can be successful in promoting&#13;
handwashing and reducing disease. With core support from the Bank Netherlands Water Partnership, the PPPHW has&#13;
brought together global public and private agencies to consolidate approaches while initiating large-scale handwashing&#13;
promotion in Ghana, Peru, Senegal, and Nepal.&#13;
&#13;
While much has been learned about handwashing promotion in recent years, especially in the areas of research and&#13;
program design, countries are still experimenting with, and optimizing approaches to implementation. It is important to&#13;
lay out what is known so that others can begin designing programs and contributing to a global body of knowledge and&#13;
experience in the fight against child mortality.&#13;
&#13;
This handbook is intended for staff in government and development organizations charged with carrying out handwashing&#13;
programs. Decision-makers in Ministries and funding agencies will also find assistance in designing policies and programs&#13;
to improve public health.&#13;
&#13;
Context&#13;
Handwashing is one of the most effective means of preventing diarrheal diseases, along with safe stool disposal and safe&#13;
and adequate household water supply. This handbook focuses entirely on handwashing and advocates for stand-alone&#13;
handwashing-with-soap programs.&#13;
&#13;
It is not the intention of this guide to detract from hygiene behaviors other than handwashing. On the contrary, each has&#13;
a place and should be addressed distinctly, carefully, and in the right context. However, it is axiomatic in communications&#13;
programs that messages have to be single and simple: economies of scale do not operate at the level of message&#13;
delivery. For example, conveying two messages in a single communication reduces the effectiveness of each by half.&#13;
Consequently, lumping the three key hygiene behaviors together is inadvisable.&#13;
&#13;
The handwashing promotion approach described in this book involves careful consumer research followed by&#13;
up-to-date marketing efforts. This approach adapts itself well to other health issues, and lessons learned from&#13;
carrying out a handwashing program could clearly be applied to other programs using similar technical and&#13;
institutional approaches.&#13;
&#13;
Current efforts to promote good hygiene, including handwashing, have not been sufficient to engender mass behavior&#13;
change. Many public health programs include improved hygiene among their objectives: in any country at any time,&#13;
one might find a diarrheal disease control program, a school health education program that includes hygiene, a water&#13;
supply and sanitation program that invests in raising hygiene awareness, and sporadic local-level hygiene education.&#13;
All these efforts share the weakness of treating hygiene as a side issue, rather than a central one. Sufficient resources&#13;
are lacking; imagination, human skills, and enthusiasm are not fully engaged; and the approaches may be outdated.&#13;
No one agency champions hygiene, and financing bodies do not see its importance. Objectives committed to paper&#13;
are never fully operationalized, resourced, evaluated, or monitored. Successes have largely been confined to individual&#13;
villages, achieved by approaches that cannot be scaled up countrywide. Worse, confusion reigns at the most basic&#13;
level as to what good hygiene is: different actors define it differently, and prejudice and local preference take&#13;
precedence over evidence.&#13;
&#13;
The approach outlined here aims to resolve all of these problems: it raises awareness, enhances political commitment&#13;
and resource allocation for hygiene, offers a route to a coordinated national program, combining them all under one&#13;
umbrella. It also uses high-profile and up-to-date methodologies to change the hygiene behavior which consistently&#13;
demonstrates the greatest potential impact on overall public health; handwashing with soap.&#13;

Just as every child has a right to vaccination, each should also have the right to protection from hand-&#13;
transmitted disease. This means simply washing hands with soap after using the toilet or cleaning a child and&#13;
before handling food.&#13;
&#13;
The Leading Causes of Child Mortality&#13;
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that diarrhea and respiratory infections are responsible for two-&#13;
thirds of child deaths (figure 1). UNICEF estimates that diarrhea alone kills one child every 30 seconds. The vast&#13;
majority of child mortality occurs among the world's poorest populations in low- and middle-income countries.&#13;

Handwashing with Soap:&#13;
The Most Effective Vaccine against Childhood Infections?&#13;
Human feces are the main source of diarrheal pathogens. They are also the source of shigellosis, typhoid, cholera, all&#13;
other common endemic gastro-enteric infections, and some respiratory infections: just one gram of human feces can&#13;
contain 10 million viruses and one million bacteria. These pathogens are passed from an infected host to a new one via&#13;
various routes, as shown in figure 2. While the routes are numerous, they all emanate from one source: feces. While&#13;
secondary measures (food handling, water purification, and fly control) may have an impact, far more important are the&#13;
primary barriers ¬≠ sanitation and handwashing ¬≠ after fecal contact. These barriers prevent fecal pathogens from&#13;
reaching the domestic environment in the first place.&#13;
&#13;
Handwashing interrupts the transmission of disease agents and so can significantly reduce diarrhea and respiratory&#13;
infections, as well as skin infections and trachoma. A recent review (Curtis and Cairncross 2003) suggests that&#13;
handwashing with soap, particularly after contact with feces (post-defecation and after handling a child's stool), can&#13;
reduce diarrheal incidence by 42-47 percent, while ongoing work by Rabie et al. suggests a 30 percent reduction in&#13;
respiratory infections is possible through handwashing. This remains true even in areas that are highly fecally&#13;
contaminated and have poor sanitation. Another current study found that children under 15 years living in households&#13;
that received handwashing promotion and soap had half the diarrheal rates of children living in control neighborhoods&#13;
(Luby et al. 2004). Because handwashing can prevent the transmission of a variety of pathogens, it may be more&#13;
effective than any single vaccine. Promoted on a wide-enough scale, handwashing with soap could be thought of as&#13;
a `do-it-yourself' vaccine.&#13;

if not disposed of safely, and are then spread by the four F's: flies, on fingers, in fluids, and via surfaces, such as fields.&#13;
Cutting these routes of transmission is key to the prevention of diarrheal disease, but which of the many possible hygiene&#13;
practices would eliminate the most disease? Boiling or sterilizing water in the home would reduce diarrhea, but preventing&#13;
fecal pathogens from ever reaching household water is likely better and more cost-effective. Similarly, foods should&#13;
clearly be reheated carefully to kill any bugs that multiplied during storage, but preventing fecal pathogens from ever&#13;
reaching food is more effective.&#13;
&#13;
Two key actions isolate fecal material and prevent its reaching the environment and then the four F's. These actions are adequately&#13;
disposing of adult and child feces and handwashing with soap after touching feces. Such touching occurs after using a toilet or when&#13;
cleaning a child after defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Some respiratory tract infections, including the SARS-causing coronavirus, are also transmitted via the fecal-oral route or simply on&#13;
hands, so handwashing helps prevent these infections as well.&#13;
&#13;
How should hands be washed? The evidence suggests that soap ¬≠ any soap ¬≠ and water adequately remove microbe-containing&#13;
dirt from hands. Antibacterial soaps or other hand-sanitizing technologies have no additional advantage. Hands have to be fully&#13;
covered with soap and then rinsed off.&#13;

The Challenge of Handwashing Promotion&#13;
If handwashing with soap is so important, why doesn't everyone do it?&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 suggests that worldwide rates of handwashing with soap are very low. While many wash their hands&#13;
with water, only a small percentage use soap at critical times.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The cause of low handwashing rates is rarely a lack of soap. Soap is present in the vast majority of households worldwide,&#13;
but it is commonly used for bathing and laundry, not handwashing. Lack of water is usually not a problem either, as hands&#13;
can be effectively washed with little, or recycled, water. In studies around the world, the main reason given why rates&#13;
of handwashing with soap are so low is that it is simply not a habit.&#13;
&#13;
The challenge remains ¬≠ to make handwashing with soap a habit and a social norm on a worldwide basis.&#13;
&#13;
What's New about This Approach?&#13;
This handbook outlines how handwashing behavior can be changed on a large or national scale by providing lessons from&#13;
industrial marketing approaches as well as from current public health thinking. Its core feature is a focus on the&#13;
potential handwasher as a consumer, who has many choices to make. With the handwasher as the focal point, this&#13;
handbook explains how to:&#13;
&#13;
! Research consumer needs to delve into handwashing habits, barriers and drivers of behavior change, and the best&#13;
ways to communicate to the target audience;&#13;
&#13;
! Design appropriate and appealing messages; and&#13;
&#13;
! Implement a promotion program that makes use of all suitable channels, including outreach workers,&#13;
citizen networks, special events, soap distributors, schools, and mass media.&#13;
&#13;
Section 1 of this handbook describes the foundations for a national handwashing program. Section 2 discusses how to&#13;
understand consumers so that the handwashing campaign can be designed around their reality. Section 3 explains how&#13;
new insights can become a campaign that is effective in changing handwashing behavior. Section 4 outlines the organization&#13;
of a handwashing program, providing information that spans the other stages; it is designed to be read in parallel with&#13;
previous sections. The annex provides examples of tools, such as study instrument and terms of reference.&#13;

Though industry likes to be a good citizen, what drives      up the international list of priorities, more and more&#13;
&#13;
country-level activities is profit. Industries invest time,  organizations are preparing to invest in handwashing&#13;
&#13;
expertise, and resources where they see a potential          promotion. To obtain donor support, it is important to&#13;
&#13;
profit. It is therefore vital to make estimates of           determinedonors'priorities,wheredecision-makingability&#13;

&#13;
example, one could estimate that each handwashing            Decision-making about the use of funds from bilateral&#13;
event uses 0.5 grams of soap; this factor can be             agencies, such as the Danish International Development&#13;
multiplied by the population of the target area, the         Agency (DANIDA) and the United Kingdom Department&#13;
average number of times a person would wash hands            for International Development (DFID), is increasingly&#13;
each day, and the number of days in the period being         devolved to the national level, and accessing them may&#13;
considered. The resulting estimate would show how            require lobbying at local, government, and international&#13;
much more soap could be sold to each individual. Note        levels. Multilateral agencies, such as the United Nations&#13;
that the soap brands that may benefit include laundry        Children's Fund (UNICEF), may have programs that can&#13;
bars and locally made soaps, not just toilet soaps or        support handwashing in parts of a country. Lastly,&#13;
special handwashing formulations.                            World Bank loans for water and sanitation may specify&#13;
                                                             expenditure on hygiene.&#13;
Other potential benefits to industry include being&#13;
able to extend or stretch existing brands, grow&#13;
existing handwashing brands, raise visibility, and           Financing Issues&#13;

Once a platform for developing the handwashing work                            Consumer needs are many and varied. They may include&#13;

moving forward, the focus then shifts to the potential                         comfortable and fresh, and to provide the best for their&#13;
handwashers, called "consumers" in marketing                                   families. While health may seem an obvious need from&#13;

marketing approach means putting the needs of the                              messages. To market handwashing successfully, the&#13;
target audiences at the center and having their                                following four questions about consumers must be&#13;

Professor and author Philip Kotler, "Marketing is satisfying                   ! What drivers, habits, and/or environment can change&#13;
needs and wants through an exchange process."                                      behavior?&#13;
Marketers thus offer the consumer something that they&#13;
want and that they are prepared to make sacrifices for,                        ! How do people communicate?&#13;
either through expenditure of money, time, or effort.                          The answers to these questions provide the key elements&#13;
The heart of the marketing task is thus to find out what                       of consumer research. The process combines the insight&#13;
consumers want and then to offer it to them in a way                           of experts in consumer behavior, health, and handwashing&#13;

&#13;
of their influence on the primary audience. For example,       of actual behavior. For example, in Ghana 75 percent&#13;

      of Kerala partnered with the Indian Soap and          media support.&#13;
      Toiletries Manufacturers' Association (ISTMA) to&#13;
      develop a handwashing promotion program across        Better informed stakeholders: Not all key&#13;

      School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM),        soap companies were involved and participated,&#13;
      and a number of NGOs were also involved.              this was not widely known and led to the perception&#13;
                                                            that multinationals would take over the market.&#13;

      including doctors, local newspapers, and opposition   the campaign was not promoting any particular firm&#13;
      politicians. The main points of criticism were:       or brand, and more than one internationally&#13;
      (a) the choice of Kerala for the program in view of   recognized organization was highly involved.&#13;
      its already high human development indicators;&#13;

      the indigenous and local soap industry by increasing  on providing safe water and sanitation&#13;
      the market share of multinational soap companies;     infrastructure rather than handwashing. This&#13;
      and (d) the suggestion that the state government      argument was buttressed by the assertion that&#13;
      was capitulating to World Bank pressure. In the       safe water and sanitation initiatives are "tangible&#13;
      face of mounting media attacks and after a long       and based on hardware," while a communication-&#13;

      interested donor, an interested soap company, and     Information of the benefits of handwashing and the&#13;

example, is needed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness.       public health will also help improve acceptance. In&#13;
In addition, public-private partnerships can be slow to     particular, rigorous trials of the impact of handwashing&#13;
build and be even slower to show results. This is not       on infectious disease are needed. The evidence for the&#13;
surprising, since communication between groups with         impact on acute respiratory infections, specifically, is still&#13;
different traditions, aims, and ways of doing business are  weak and needs more investigation. In addition more&#13;
difficult. Furthermore, personnel changes frequently        research on comparing the effectiveness of different&#13;

example shows. Nevertheless, as handwashing with soap       optimize implementation.&#13;
programs demonstrate their effectiveness, and&#13;
documentation of experiences is applied, momentum and       Available evidence is sufficient to enable public health to&#13;
&#13;
efficiencies will grow and stimulating partnerships         act on issues that, on balances of probability, look the&#13;

                                                            handwashing with soap ubiquitous is a key challenge for&#13;
Anther key issue PPPs face is that hygiene does not have    public health in the 21st century. Government, industry,&#13;
a single institutional home. In the many programs, such     support agencies, and academia all have important&#13;
as Ghana, funding came from the water and sanitation        roles to play.&#13;

What Is a Behavioral Trial?                                     not use the soap given to them as those who experienced&#13;
A behavioral trial introduces a behavior to individuals and     positive experiences. Often informants will refer to&#13;
assesses their experiences with trying to carry out that        subjective concepts such as cleanliness and dirtiness. It is&#13;
behavior over a period of seven to 14 days. It gives insight    important that you probe into what people mean by such&#13;
into how easily that new behavior is adopted, things that       terms and how they are indicated, noting especially what&#13;
facilitated its practice, and those that hindered it. In this   sensory cues (touch, sight, smell, etc.) are involved.&#13;
case a soap is given to each participant, who is asked to       The Post-Experience Interview&#13;
use this soap ONLY for handwashing with soap, focusing&#13;
particularly on handwashing after contact with feces (after     ! Last week I left a soap with you and asked you to use&#13;
defecation, after wiping a child's behind, and after            it specifically for handwashing, did you use it?&#13;

period of time an interviewer visits each woman and             ! ASK TO SEE THE SOAP AND NOTE HOW MUCH&#13;

carries out an in-depth interview with her to learn about       THE PRODUCT APPEARS TO BE USED AND WHERE&#13;

            The handwashing handbook: a guide for
            developing a hygiene promotion program to increase
            handwashing with soap
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This handbook grows out of the
            experience of the Global Public-Private Partnership for
            Handwashing with Soap (PPPHW) and its predecessor, the
            Central American Handwashing for Diarrheal Disease
            Prevention Program. These efforts demonstrated that mass
            programs with public and private sector involvement can be
            successful in promoting handwashing and reducing disease.
            With core support from the Bank Netherlands Water
            Partnership, the PPPHW has brought together global public
            and private agencies to consolidate approaches while
            initiating large-scale handwashing promotion in Ghana, Peru,
            Senegal, and Nepal. While much has been learned about
            handwashing promotion in recent years, especially in the
            areas of research and program design, countries are still
            experimenting with, and optimizing approaches to
            implementation. It is important to lay out what is known so
            that others can begin designing programs and contributing to
            a global body of knowledge and experience in the fight
            against child mortality. This handbook is intended for staff
            in government and development organizations charged with
            carrying out handwashing programs. Decision-makers in
            Ministries and funding agencies will also find assistance in
            designing policies and programs to improve public health.
