STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. SOCIAL SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISSUES&#13;
A. Economic Context&#13;
1.01   Over the past decade, Morocco has instituted reforms designed to achieve macroeconomic&#13;
stability and to liberalise the economy. Wide-reaching and comprehensive, the reforms have&#13;
gradually moved Morocco away from a predominantly state-administered economy towards one that&#13;
is more market-driven and outward-oriented. Yet, progress achieved on the macroeconomic front&#13;
remains fragile, as demonstrated by the continued indebtedness, and the deterioration in the fiscal&#13;
and external accounts which were exarcerbated by the 1995 drought.&#13;
1.02   Morocco's growth rate, which averaged about 4% annually during the last decade, fell well&#13;
below expectations and was too low to absorb the country's growing labor force.  Private&#13;
investment and domestic saving rates remain modest; labor productivity is not increasing; and&#13;
international competitiveness has recently eroded. The situation has been further exacerbated by the&#13;
recent drought, but prospects for 1996 are brighter. Despite significant recent progress,&#13;
performance has also been disappointing in the social sectors. Morocco's indicators in health,&#13;
education, literacy, and access to safe water continue to lag behind those of economically&#13;
comparable countries.  A fifth of the population still lives in poverty or near-poverty, urban&#13;
unemployment rates have reached 20%, and rural women are still economically and socially&#13;
marginalized.&#13;
1.03   Morocco's low social performance and its relative economic success are intimately related.&#13;
For even with constructive political and economic reforms in place, the country cannot reach and&#13;
sustain higher economic growth rates without a substantial accumulation of human capital. To&#13;
achieve such a reserve, it must boost its investment in the provision of basic social services.&#13;
Conversely, without sustained economic growth, it will be extremely difficult to improve&#13;
substantially employment opportunities and living conditions of its population, which already stands&#13;
at 26 million and is growing apace.&#13;
B. Poverty&#13;
1.04   Data gathered from  the 1985 Household Consumption Survey and the 1991 Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) showed that the share of Morocco's population living&#13;
below the poverty line fell from 21 to 13% in those six years, while the GNP per capita rose by&#13;
about 30% (and presently hovers at around US$ 1,1 00). This performance was achieved during the&#13;
period of structural adjustment. Adding the number of those whose expenditure levels are just&#13;
above the poverty line to the number of those who live below it, more than 3.3 million Moroccans&#13;
are poor enough to be isolated from the mainstream economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.05   Urban, rural, and regional variations are also striking, and the gap dividing them  is&#13;
deepening. In 1991, 72% of all poor lived in rural areas as compared to 70% six years earlier.&#13;
Likewise, while a quarter of the population lived in poverty in the Center-North, East, and Center-&#13;
South regions, the poverty rate was below 5 % in coastal areas. In rural areas, the poor are typically&#13;
either seasonally underemployed wage-earners or small-scale farmers. In urban areas they are&#13;
mostly self-employed people who work in the informal sector, underpaid (often temporary) wage-&#13;
earners, or are unemployed. If access to basic social services is taken into account, still more&#13;
differences between urban and rural areas come to light.&#13;
1.06   Along with low pay, unemployment and underemployment are major determinants of&#13;
poverty. In the early 1990s, the aggregate unemployment rate in urban areas was estimated at 16 to&#13;
20%, but among the urban poor the unemployment rate reached 30%. Unemployment rates are&#13;
much lower in rural areas, but these areas suffer substantial, chronic underemployment.  Not&#13;
surprisingly unemployment is most widespread among those with little or no education, but neither&#13;
are those with a secondary education immune. Unemployment rates are higher for women overall.&#13;
1.07   The growing importance of the informal sector--although a sign of the economy' s&#13;
dynamism and ability to absorb excess labor supply and react to demand--reflects an increase in the&#13;
reservoir of persons prone to fall below the poverty threshold.  The poverty assessment report&#13;
(World Bank 1994) found a strong link between poverty in economic terms and such social ills as&#13;
low literacy, education, health, and nutrition levels and high fertility rates. That report, and other&#13;
studies, also found a strong correlation between income levels and degree of access to basic social&#13;
services. In light of these findings, the report strongly recommends the rehabilitation of basic social&#13;
services as a necessary prerequisite for the durable alleviation of poverty. Yet, until recently the&#13;
various social policies and programs were not strongly coordinated, and the link between this&#13;
disparate set of sectoral actions and the macroeconomic framework was loose.  There was,&#13;
moreover, no visible political will to address the problem of lagging social sector performance.&#13;
C. Population, Health and Nutrition&#13;
Population and health&#13;
1.08   As the other countries of the Maghreb, Morocco is in the midst of a demographic,&#13;
epidemiologic, and social transition resulting from the diminution of the mortality rate from 19 per&#13;
1,000 in the 1960s to 7.3 per 1,000 in 1992 and a diminution in birth rates to 28.1 per 1,000. The&#13;
annual population growth rate slowed from 2.8% for 1955-60 to 2.06% in 1982-1994. On the&#13;
health front, transmissible diseases and maternal and child-related health problems are coming&#13;
increasingly under control but still represent* an important burden of disease ("the unfinished&#13;
agenda" as it is referred to in the epidemiologic transition), while the impact of chronic diseases is&#13;
rising. In 1989, for instance, cardiovascular diseases caused one out of five deaths in Morocco.&#13;
The country's successful priority health programs and improved lifestyles are responsible for these&#13;
significant health gains. Over the last thirty years infant mortality has decreased from 119 to 61.6&#13;
per 1,000 and life expectancy at birth has increased from 45 to 65 years.&#13;
1.09   But despite these significant achievements, key indicators remain low.  The maternal&#13;
mortality rate is among the highest in Africa, averaging 332 per 100,000 as compared to 50 in&#13;
Tunisia and 140 in Algeria. Inadequate handling of complicated deliveries is the main cause of&#13;
death--not surprisingly, since only 40% of all deliveries take place in a medical setting (compared to&#13;
76% in Tunisia). Access to health facilities, evacuation procedures, and the medical referral system&#13;
are deficient. Survey results also suggest that the prevalence of male health personnel is a possible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
factor in Morocco's low use rates of maternal medical services. In addition, the fact that early&#13;
neonatal deaths account for half of the infant mortality rate reflects the poor quality of services&#13;
offered. Such potentially controllable infectious diseases as acute respiratory infections, diarrhea,&#13;
measles, and meningitis are also among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in children&#13;
aged one to five. Tuberculosis, malaria and schistosomiasis are still non-negligeable features of&#13;
morbidity, and poor hygiene and sanitation in the rural areas are a cause of serious concern.&#13;
Although acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS) is not yet a major problem, sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases (which increase the risk of HIV infection) affect more than 7% of the&#13;
population, according to a recent survey.&#13;
1.10   Morocco's population is expected to grow from 26 million currently to 33 million by 2007.&#13;
At that time, the natural rate of increase will be 1.30%. The population under 15 would then&#13;
represent a quarter of the population as against 38% now. Since 1968, family planning has been&#13;
integrated into all development plans. In 1976 a division was created within the Ministry of Public&#13;
Health (Ministere de la Sante Publique, MSP) to launch the VDMS program (visite a domicile de&#13;
motivation systematique)--a major community outreach effort that subsequently led to the rapid&#13;
development of family planning activities. This program and the increase of age at marriage, from&#13;
17.3 years in 1960 to 24 years in 1987, are responsible for the decrease in the total fertility rate&#13;
(TFR) in Morocco from 7.4 to 3.6 children per woman. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate&#13;
is now estimated at approximately 43%, with the pill being the most widely used method. The&#13;
Government's objective for the year 2000 is to decrease the TFR to 2.6 children per woman.&#13;
1.11   Seven separate surveys have been carried out over a twenty-year period regarding the&#13;
nutritional status of the population and Morocco has made significant efforts to deal with problems&#13;
of food insecurity. The typical Moroccan diet's daily supply of calories (essentially from sugar,&#13;
cereals, oils and other fats) would be adequate if food were equitably distributed. But as it now&#13;
stands approximately 17% of children are wasted, stunted, or both. Children in the rural areas are&#13;
at a clear disadvantage, and acute and chronic malnutrition are most prevalent in the South and&#13;
Tensift regions. A 1989 infant mortality survey showed that malnutrition, associated with diarrhea,&#13;
was the leading cause of death for children aged twenty-eight days to five years. It also showed&#13;
significant gaps in the nutritional status of the urban versus the rural population, and men versus&#13;
women. A 1994 national survey on iron and iodine deficiency found that 22% of children aged six&#13;
to twelve were iodine deficient. Even more strikingly, 35.5% of children aged six months to five&#13;
years and 45.5% of all pregnant women suffered from iron-deficiency anemia. A strategy to deal&#13;
with iodine deficiency is presently being implemented with the assistance of the United Nations&#13;
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), and a strategy to address&#13;
the problem of iron deficiency is being discussed (Annex 4).&#13;
Organization of the health system&#13;
1.12   The national health system is organized around three sectors: public (MSP and Royal Army&#13;
structures), semiprivate (mutuals and the CNSS, Caisse nationale de securite sociale, a network of&#13;
twenty-three hospitals and clinics for government employees and their dependents) and private&#13;
(about 2,550 private doctor's offices and 110 clinics). The private sector tends to be concentrated in&#13;
major urban areas. The rural population relies almost entirely on the public sector for the provision&#13;
of health care.&#13;
1.13   The MSP was reorganized in December 1994 and now includes seven directorates at the&#13;
central level and sixty provincial delegations headed by physicians (Annex 1). Each provincial&#13;
delegation includes an ambulatory unit staffed by a physician and nurses. This structure is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
responsible for all preventive and ambulatory care. But given the fact that MSP has until now been&#13;
a highly centralized organization, the provincial level's actual contribution to planning has been&#13;
quite limited so far, with the exception of some pilot experiences.&#13;
1.14    The public sector network includes about 1,650 basic health facilities (E0tablissements de&#13;
Soins de Sante de Base, ESSBs), and 98 hospitals (provincial, regional, and university). The ESSBs&#13;
include urban and rural dispensaries and health centers and represent the first interface of the&#13;
population with the fixed facility system. They provide primary health care and handle deliveries,&#13;
and all services are free of charge. In addition to the ESSBs, service coverage is provided by&#13;
mobile clinics, outreach health workers, and in some remote areas, by traditional birth attendants&#13;
(kablats).&#13;
Major sector issues&#13;
1.15   Major sector issues include the inequity and inefficiency of the health system; the&#13;
insufficient coverage of the rural population; the poor performance of the public health system,&#13;
especially at the basic level; the situation in the pharmaceutical industry; insufficient financing to&#13;
cover the rising cost of health care; and the centralization of management.&#13;
1.16   Inequity and inefficiency of the health system. Discrepancies between urban and rural&#13;
areas and among regions are striking. The infant mortality rate is 65 per thousand in rural areas as&#13;
opposed to 44 per thousand in urban areas; total fertility is 4.9 children per woman in rural areas&#13;
compared to 2.2 in urban areas; and the under five mortality rate is 160 per thousand in the south,&#13;
the poorest region of the country, as opposed to 66 per thousand in the center. Three-quarters of&#13;
health personnel are concentrated in Rabat and Casablanca, where their services are underused.&#13;
Morocco's better off citizens receive 40% of the MSP budget, the poorest receive less than 20% of&#13;
this budget--translating into a per capita health expenditure which is 2.6 times greater in urban&#13;
areas. The former therefore benefit more from the system. The hospital network, moreover, is&#13;
mostly concentrated in the northeastern and central regions, and while all categories of health care&#13;
personnel have significantly increased since 1960, 63% of physicians in the public sector are&#13;
assigned to hospitals, with only 30% working in the ESSBs. The sector as a whole is poorly&#13;
managed (as can be seen from its record of poor maintenance of equipment and infrastructure,&#13;
waste, inadequate management and deployment of human resources, and poor logistics).  By&#13;
targeting Morocco's needy, the project would address the issue of inequity. It would also address&#13;
the problem of inefficiency at the basic health level, since the hospital level is being dealt with by a&#13;
separate Bank-funded project, under preparation (Health Management and Financing Project,&#13;
FY97).&#13;
1.17   Insufficient coverage of the rural population. It is estimated that 37% of Moroccans use&#13;
fixed public sector health facilities, and this number reaches 79% in lower-income groups and rural&#13;
areas. By comparison, 52% of consultations are handled by private sector physicians. Data from&#13;
the 1991 LSMS show that health care consumption is income elastic: the use rate is 64% among the&#13;
20% richest of the sample, as against 32% for the 20% lowest income group. While the coverage&#13;
provided by the basic health network has significantly improved during the last decade, only 47% of&#13;
the rural population now has access within six kilometers to fixed primary care facilities provided&#13;
by the public sector, and no private facilities exist in the rural areas. Fourteen percent of rural&#13;
people have no coverage, even in theory. This situation is not only caused by the inadequate&#13;
distribution of health facilities and manpower between regions and in rural areas but also by their&#13;
insufficient number overall. Approximately 53 % of the rural population, moreover, lives more than&#13;
six kilometers away from an existing health care facility, which represents a major constraint to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
access, especially that the private sector is not likely to expand significantly into the rural areas. The&#13;
coverage provided by the mobile teams and outreach health workers (infifrmiers itinerants) is not&#13;
functioning well, and the number of such workers has been diminishing significantly. The project&#13;
would address these issues in the provinces targeted.&#13;
1.18   Poor quality within the basic health care system. The low credibility of the public health&#13;
system largely explains its low rate of use. Curative care is virtually nonexistent, and visible and&#13;
sustainable improvements in essential service delivery would be necessary to build the public's&#13;
confidence in the ESSBs. During project preparation, a beneficiary assessment carried out in a&#13;
sample of five of the provinces targeted under the project indicated that approximately half of the&#13;
sample population was unhappy with the overall performance of public health facilities because of&#13;
the lack of drugs, long waiting time, and poor staff attitude. As confirmed by surveys undertaken&#13;
during project preparation, many facilities lack basic equipment and are poorly maintained. This&#13;
accounts mainly for the low utilization of these services. Two-third of all public facility medical&#13;
equipment have not been replaced in the last fifteen years. As confirmed by surveys undertaken&#13;
during project preparation, the mobile clinics, too, are poorly equipped and organized, are not&#13;
supervised, are poorly maintained, and resources to supervise and keep them functioning properly&#13;
are lacking.&#13;
1.19   Health personnel, moreover, are not adequately deployed, are poorly motivated, and are not&#13;
properly trained to deliver services. Because of lack of support from the MSP at the central and&#13;
provincial levels, the number of outreach health workers is decreasing rapidly (there are barely a&#13;
thousand left in the country). Mobile clinics and outreach workers, moreover, are not well&#13;
integrated in the system and deliver in fact only a small portion of the essential services they are&#13;
supposed to provide. Morocco's priority health programs are suffering from this situation. To give&#13;
a few examples, the safe motherhood program is clearly lagging behind with only 45 % (as opposed&#13;
to almost 60% in Tunisia) of pregnant women seeking prenatal care. Immunization coverage in rural&#13;
areas has improved (to around 78%) but is still very insufficient. Emergency evacuations still do&#13;
not exist, a situation which contributes to unacceptable levels of maternal, neonatal and infant&#13;
mortality rates for a middle-income country such as Morocco.&#13;
1.20   Insufficient financing and rising cost of health care. Public sector financing accounts for&#13;
34% of total health expenditures in Morocco, NGOs and international aid for 4% and the private&#13;
sector for 62%. Total health expenditures represent 3.8% of GDP (as compared to 4.9% in Tunisia&#13;
and 7% in Algeria). Approximately 92% of public sector financing comes from MSP budget,&#13;
which grew in real terms by 3.7% annually from 1960 to 1994. But if the effect of population&#13;
growth is added to inflation, MSP's budget has been virtually stagnant during that period, averaging&#13;
increases of only 1.3% a year. The MSP's share of government expenditures, moreover, decreased&#13;
from 7.8% in 1960 to 2.9% in 1975, then rose again to 4.6 in 1994. About 75% of the MSP&#13;
recurrent budget, moreover, goes to hospitals, which have no mechanisms to ensure better targeting&#13;
of the needy population, which is eligible for free care. Expenditure on personnel represent 55 % of&#13;
the MSP total budget. Health costs are defrayed by households, which contribute up to 50% of&#13;
expenditures&#13;
1.21   Per capita health expenditure (less than US$40) is relatively low in Morocco when&#13;
compared with that in other countries of similar economic development (such as Tunisia's US$100).&#13;
Public expenditure is also distributed poorly within the sector and across regions and milieus. As&#13;
Morocco enters an epidemiologic, demographic, and social transition, and as income increases, the&#13;
demand for health care will be even greater. An aging population will demand more sophisticated&#13;
medical technology and long-term care, both of which are costly. It will therefore be even more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
difficult for the Government to sustain the rising cost of health care. The MSP is presently&#13;
conducting a study to analyze the changing situation in the sector (Maghreb Health Priorities Study&#13;
FY96). At the same time a Health Management and Financing Project is being prepared in&#13;
collaboration with the World Bank which will address financial as well as managerial issues.&#13;
1.22   The situation in the pharmaceutical sector.  Morocco has a thriving pharmaceutical&#13;
industry that produces a large quantity of drugs, covers over 80% of the country's pharmaceutical&#13;
consumption and has started to export to other countries in the Region. The Moroccan industry,&#13;
however, has been partly protected from international competition by high tariffs that have increased&#13;
the cost of drugs to the population, and some firms have not achieved the level of quality of&#13;
production that should be expected. Most of the pharmaceutical market is in the private sector, and&#13;
serves wealthy and middle-class populations, as essential drugs often prove too expensive for the&#13;
poor. The small public sector takes care of drug supply to primary care facilities and hospitals.&#13;
Because of severe budget under-funding for essential drugs, Morocco has relied on external&#13;
financing, including Bank loans, to finance a large share of public sector drug provision. This&#13;
policy of financing basic operating costs through external assistance has proved a major disincentive&#13;
for exploring other financing avenues, such as cost recovery, and has created a serious issue of&#13;
sustainability in the medium and long term.&#13;
1.23   Morocco does not have a comprehensive pharmaceutical policy which guarantees reasonable&#13;
access to essential drugs to the poor. Quality control and inspection have not performed adequately,&#13;
and the drug pricing policy has favored the distribution of relatively expensive drugs in the private&#13;
sector over that of cheap products. The recent reorganization of what used to be the Pharmacie&#13;
Centrale (Central Pharmacy), under the umbrella of the MSP, has improved the overall management&#13;
of stocks and MSP is committed to pursue this effort. However, logistics is still deficient and delays&#13;
in the delivery of drugs to hospitals and the peripheral level are still more than a month, except for&#13;
emergencies. Despite noticeable improvement in the procurement of drugs, the annual unique&#13;
bidding process limits the possibilities to negotiate interesting prices. Because of these shortcomings,&#13;
health facilities often face shortages and have to buy directly from local suppliers at a high price.&#13;
The most serious problems in the public sector are the insufficient funding allocated through the&#13;
budget and the inadequate intrasectoral allocation of resources for drugs among the different levels&#13;
of health care, with hospitals taking the lion's share of drug allocations. In the early 1990's, the&#13;
annual budget allocated to drugs and consumables was approximately 200 million of dirhams. This&#13;
number has been decreasing recently, and hospitals use 36% of this budget. Per capita expenditures&#13;
on drugs is estimated to US$23 of which US$1 comes from the public sector. During project&#13;
preparation, the Bank funded a major pharmaceutical study. Agreement on actions to be taken in&#13;
the sector was reached at negotiations [para.6.03 a(ii)].&#13;
1.24   Centralization of management. An effective partnership between the central and provincial&#13;
administrations does not currently exist. The provincial level, perceived as the implementing arm,&#13;
has traditionally enjoyed little decisionmaking power, leaving little room for the initiatives and local&#13;
adjustments necessary for the development of programs. Key aspects of personnel management are&#13;
also centralized, an issue that will need to be dealt with if peripheral units are to manage their own&#13;
personnel. The performance of rural health programs and services is also hampered by the lack of a&#13;
locus for managing local health systems. Under the current arrangements, districts are widely&#13;
dispersed and no intermediate level between province and district exists.  With the recent&#13;
reorganization (December 1994), the MSP is in the process of redefining the respective mandates of&#13;
the central and provincial administrations, and defining the role of the MSP at each level of health&#13;
care would be an important outcome of the Sectoral Action Plan. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached that mechanisms to strengthen provincial participation to planning of and decision-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
making for sector activities would be identified, submitted to the Bank and implemented by&#13;
December 31, 1997 [para 6.03a (iii)].&#13;
II. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND BANK RESPONSE&#13;
A. Government Strategy&#13;
2.01   For a long time in Morocco, spending to promote human capital was not considered an&#13;
investment that would ultimately lead to greater and more sustainable economic growth, and instead,&#13;
economic growth was perceived as the only engine of social progress. Therefore, social concerns&#13;
were not a top Government priority, and--despite indisputable sectoral improvement during the&#13;
1980s and 1990s--there was no comprehensive, long-term plan for the social welfare of the country.&#13;
2.02   But following an era of thorough macroeconomic adjustment and worrisome decline in&#13;
social conditions throughout the Kingdom, the Government has started to focus on social issues in a&#13;
more concerted manner.  In 1993 it issued the Social Development Strategy (Strategie de&#13;
Developpement Social pour la Decennie 1990, SDS), which sets forth clear directives aimed at&#13;
reversing past trends and establishing the framework for a sound social policy. Based on the 1991&#13;
Living Standards Measurement Survey, the Government strategy made extending basic social&#13;
services to the poor and increasing their participation in economically productive activities its&#13;
highest social goals. Such extended coverage would include access to safe water, sewage facilities,&#13;
health care, family planning services, nutrition, primary education, literacy programs, and&#13;
subsidized public housing. But recognizing prevailing budgetary constrainEs, the strategy stresses&#13;
the inter- and intra-reallocation of resources and introduction of cost-recovery mechanisms. It also&#13;
advocates action to promote employment and bolster social protection. Finally, the SDS emphasizes&#13;
that a strong and appropriate administrative vehicle and reliable statistical monitoring system are&#13;
required for the implementation of its recommendations.&#13;
2.03   The Government gave the first version of the Strategie de Developpement Social pour la&#13;
Decennie 1990 to the Bank in the context of the second adjustment program. Following the&#13;
appraisal of the Social Priorities Program, the strategy was updated, formally reendorsed by the new&#13;
Government, and officially conveyed to the Bank [para. 6.01b]. Its internalization throughout the&#13;
relevant agencies is now underway. Specific Sectoral Action Plans (SAPs) are being developed for&#13;
the education and health sectors as part of the preparation of the Social Priorities Program. The&#13;
recent creation of the Ministry of Population, which has the responsibilities of a ministry of&#13;
planning, and should be able to coordinate actions throughout the social sectors within a unifying&#13;
framework, is another signal that the Government is taking social concerns seriously and is adapting&#13;
its institutions accordingly. Finally, the King's address to the Parliament of Morocco in October&#13;
1995 shows that concerns for the social situation now emanate from the highest levels of the power&#13;
hierarchy.&#13;
2.04   Public resources for health are limited, and competition with other sectors for these&#13;
resources is great. Moreover, considerable deficits have accumulated in the sector, and projected&#13;
growing needs in the future (given population and demographic trends) will have to be addressed,&#13;
while at the same time promoting efficiency and equity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
2.05  The Government has already taken a number of strategic measures to deal with these&#13;
challenges:&#13;
(a) resources will be targeted toward priority rural areas. The latest investment program&#13;
already reflects this new policy, and the MSP's Programme de Medicalisation du Monde&#13;
Rural is staffing rural health centers with physicians.  Four-hundred physicians have&#13;
already been deployed to priority districts;&#13;
(b) the Government is also working on a health financing reform plan that would introduce&#13;
compulsory health insurance. Discussions on establishing a fund to subsidize health care&#13;
for the needy are also under way, but no agreement has as yet been reached on this&#13;
important issue. At the same time, greater efficiency is being sought by reorganizing&#13;
hospitals, granting them autonomy (SEGMA) and integrating priority health programs.&#13;
These measures should also make it possible to channel more resources to the primary&#13;
health level, as required in the SAP;&#13;
(c) priority health programs will be strengthened, with special emphasis on programs in&#13;
maternal and child health; and&#13;
(d) roles and functions of the central and provincial levels will be redefined in the context of&#13;
the recent reorganization of the MSP in order to give more autonomy to the provinces. The&#13;
submission of the SAP was a condition of negotiations [para.6.02a].&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.06   The severe state of degradation of Morocco's social sectors underscores the urgent need for&#13;
intensive, durable action. Bank support for such action is called for both by the present climate of&#13;
support in the Government and by the Bank's own Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), currently&#13;
under preparation, which puts investing in people as its first priority. Bank support for the social&#13;
sector would also accord with its parallel efforts to strengthen macroeconomic performance and&#13;
encourage growth through private investment. Other donors have viewed the goals of the Strategie&#13;
de Developpement Social pour la Decennie 1990 (based on the Living Standards Measurement&#13;
Survey and confirmed by the World Bank poverty assessment) as a rallying point, and support for&#13;
SDS policies is fully in line with the Bank's strategy of poverty alleviation and Morocco's overall&#13;
plan to develop its human resources. Since the Bank has already financed several projects in&#13;
Morocco's social sectors--especially in health and education--the proposed project would be an&#13;
extension of earlier Bank involvement. The Country Economic Memorandum (World Bank 1995a)&#13;
provides a solid body of evidence that programs whose aim is to improve Morocco's human capital&#13;
base and to increase labor efficiency and productivity warrant reinforcement of present Bank&#13;
support. Finally, a recent study of the region's present situation and long-term prospects (World&#13;
Bank 1995b) shows that Morocco, along with its neighbors, is experiencing high unemployment and&#13;
now feels an especially urgent need for bold programs aiming for both economic growth and&#13;
poverty alleviation. The Bank's role in promoting the Government's social strategy and marshaling&#13;
international and bilateral support for social programs will be critical if Morocco is to succeed in the&#13;
fight it is waging against poverty, both in terms of equity and of economic growth.&#13;
2.07    In its SDS, the Government of Morocco identified inequity in the health 3ector as a major&#13;
impediment to socioeconomic development and committed itself to channel more resources to rural&#13;
areas, especially for the priority health programs (basic curative and preventive care, safe&#13;
motherhood, transmissible diseases, nutrition). The proposed project would help the Government to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
close the gap between rural and urban health indicators by better targeting of the needy population.&#13;
The project fits into the Bank's human resources development strategy, which supports efforts to&#13;
improve the quality and relevance of social services, to increase public spending on basic services&#13;
and improve targeting to underserved groups and areas and to increase internal efficiency overall&#13;
within the human resources sector. Project preparation was instrumental in getting the MSP to&#13;
develop its Sector Action Plan, which will provide a framework for all interventions in the health&#13;
sector, facilitate coordination, and stimulate additional grant funding from other donors.&#13;
C. Bank Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.08   In the past, the Bank has supported several operations in Morocco's social sectors, and&#13;
three such projects are currently being implemented (Rural Primary Education Project, Loan 3026-&#13;
MOR; Rural Basic Education Development Project, Loan 3295-MOR; and Health Sector Investment&#13;
Project, Loan 3171-MOR). The main general lessons to be drawn from these operations are as&#13;
follows: (a) reforms in the social sectors should not be overly ambitious because of their immense&#13;
impact on large groups and the political risks attached to them;  (b) a good management&#13;
information system and simple and transparent management, procurement, and disbursement&#13;
procedures must be in place for all Bank-financed activities. Such measures are also meant to offset&#13;
cumbersome local financing circuits, which tend to delay execution and slow down disbursements,&#13;
especially for decentralized project activities.  A study is currently being conducted by the&#13;
Government to identify precisely the bottlenecks and the sources of delays; (c) to ensure full&#13;
acceptance of the project, it is critical to seek the early involvement of all constituents--in particular,&#13;
employees of line ministries at the provincial and local level who will play a crucial role during&#13;
project implementation. It is equally important to involve other government constituencies (such as&#13;
the Ministry of Finance) and other donors early enough in the process to guarantee successful future&#13;
collaboration; (d) finally, realistic budgetary envelopes have to be projected (and committed) to&#13;
ensure the sustainability of sectoral programs and actions.&#13;
2.09   The Health Development Project (HDP, Loan 2572-MOR, US$28.8 million, 1986-93), was&#13;
the first major Bank loan in the sector. Prior to this loan, Bank involvement in the sector was&#13;
limited to a component of an agricultural project (Loan 1201-MOR) and to a health worker training&#13;
component in the Third Education Project (Loan 1220-MOR). The HDP was designed to support&#13;
the MSP primary health care program in three provinces on a pilot basis, to improve the drug&#13;
supply system, and to enhance the MSP's management capacity.  The primary health care&#13;
component was fully implemented and had a significant impact on access to health care. Some&#13;
aspects of MSP management capacity have improved, but others (program budgeting, resource&#13;
allocation, availability of drugs) remain serious concerns.&#13;
2.10   The second Bank supported operation in the sector was the Health Sector Investment Project&#13;
(HSIP, Loan 3171-MOR, US$104.0 million, 1990-96) which is still being implemented. Its&#13;
objectives are to reestablish sustainable health programs nationwide and strengthen the&#13;
administration and management of services. Given its slow start, and although its disbursement&#13;
profile has significantly improved, the project may not achieve all of its stated objectives. Its&#13;
closing date has been extended to December 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Lessons learned in the health sector&#13;
2.11   Evaluations of the Health Development Project (ICR) and of the ongoing Health Sector&#13;
Investment Project have underscored the importance of taking certain key areas into account during&#13;
project preparation and design:&#13;
(a)    The question of the financial sustainability of the system must be addressed. An agreement&#13;
with the Government is already in place for the preparation of the Health Management and&#13;
Financing Project which would address the question of health financing, sector efficiency,&#13;
and hospital management.&#13;
(b)    The provision of drugs to the public sector need to be reviewed. In May 1995, during&#13;
project preparation, the Bank's Human Development Department sponsored a major study&#13;
of the pharmaceutical sector whose conclusions have been integrated into the proposed&#13;
project [para. 1.23 ].&#13;
(c)    The different strategies for delivering services need to be analyzed carefully and adapted for&#13;
each region.  During project preparation, the National Institute of Health Management&#13;
(INAS) conducted such an analysis in a sample of the provinces where the project would be&#13;
implemented (Annex 8). The provincial medical officers of these provinces have also been&#13;
involved in the selection of districts within their provinces that would benefit from various&#13;
different types of coverage (such as health centers, mobile teams, outreach health workers).&#13;
(d)    Provincial health officials should be accorded more power to make decisions so as to ensure&#13;
that project activities are suited to local conditions. During project preparation the medical&#13;
officers of the targeted provinces attended three workshops to discuss project objectives and&#13;
agree on which priority activities needed to be developed. The MSP is also reviewing its&#13;
provincial organization plan [para. 1.24] to ensure that activities are tailored to local needs&#13;
and to stimulate initiative at the local level.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. The Social Priorities Program&#13;
3.01   The proposed project is part of the Social Priorities Program  I (SPP l; Barnamaj al-&#13;
Aoualaouiyat al-Ijtimaiya, or BAJ I, in Arabic; Programme Priorites Sociales, or PPS I, in&#13;
French), initiated to assist the Government in the implementation of its strategy to increase the&#13;
poor's access to basic social services, enhance basic social protections, and create new opportunities&#13;
for the unemployed to participate in economically productive activities. The program would also&#13;
bolster Government awareness of poverty-related and social issues and catalyze efforts to rehabilitate&#13;
Morocco's social sectors. While the SPP would entail a series of consecutive programs following&#13;
one another at a rapid pace, SPP/BAJ I was conceived as a set of three complementary projects to be&#13;
negotiated and implemented simultaneously (Annex 2). All three share the same broad objectives,&#13;
were developed within the same framework, and would be implemented independently within the&#13;
same geographical area.&#13;
3.02   By using a multisectoral approach--which is expected to yield more significant and durable&#13;
results than serial, strictly sectoral projects--this tripartite program would help to guarantee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
flexibility in execution and should therefore be a more efficient way to channel energies and&#13;
resources. The SPP/BAJ would target Morocco's thirteen poorest and least urbanized provinces,&#13;
where 27% of the total population, or 7,054 million people, currently live (provinces and selection&#13;
criteria are listed in Annex 3). By involving provincial authorities in project monitoring, moreover,&#13;
the SPP/BAJ should achieve the integration needed to reinforce its impact. The objectives of the&#13;
three projects are: (a) to increase the quality and quantity of basic education while at the same time&#13;
making the education system more efficient and equitable; (b) to improve access to basic health&#13;
services and improve their quality while bolstering performance and managerial capacities within the&#13;
health care system; (c) to enhance basic rural infrastructure through labor-intensive techniques; and&#13;
(d) to establish a permanent apparatus for data collection and analysis that would strengthen the&#13;
government' s ability to galvanize support for SDS activities and monitor their impact.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.03    Specific objectives of this project are: (a) to provide better access to essential preventive&#13;
and curative care from 47% (population currently living within 6 kms of an ESSB) to 60% of the&#13;
targeted population, including equitable access to essential drugs; (b) to reduce maternal and&#13;
neonatal mortality in the targeted areas by increasing the coverage of prenatal visits from 28 to 50%&#13;
and assisted deliveries in a medical setting from 18.5 to 30%, and by making available modern&#13;
family planning methods; and (c) to maintain the performance of priority public health programs at&#13;
the national level. For key project indicators, see Annex 7.&#13;
3.04   The innovative aspect of this project in Morocco stems from the fact that: (a) it will target&#13;
the poorest population in the country; (b) the project was designed and prepared in closed&#13;
collaboration with the local staff who would be involved in its monitoring and implementation; (c) it&#13;
would be a major support for the development of the MSP Sectoral Action Plan and would&#13;
stimulate the implementation of many activities with pay-offs in the medium-term; (d) it would be&#13;
flexible enough to allow for adjustment to the local situation; (e) it would hold provincial health&#13;
officials responsible for the planning, implementation, and monitoring of project activities in the&#13;
thirteen provinces; and (f) it would require providing drugs while implementing important actions in&#13;
the pharmaceutical sector.&#13;
3.05    The project would concentrate on specific districts in the targeted provinces. These districts&#13;
were selected as priority intervention areas (Zones d'Intervention Prioritaires, ZIP) in collaboration&#13;
with provincial medical officers according to the following criteria: demographic data, existing&#13;
access to health services, coverage, epidemiologic profile, and use of services. Most of the districts&#13;
chosen were rural.&#13;
3.06   Infant mortality and maternal and neonatal mortality are well above national averages in&#13;
these districts, and the health infrastructure there is both quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate.&#13;
The mortality and morbidity pattern is dominated by infectious diseases (measles, diarrhea, typhoid&#13;
fever, tuberculosis). Access to safe water is a major issue, and in some areas, literacy rates only&#13;
reach 20%. In addition to health coverage being insufficient in those areas, the people rarely use&#13;
the services that are available, mainly because of their poor quality. While the project would focus&#13;
most of its activities on these selected areas, moreover, certain interventions would be carried out&#13;
nationally (such as the transmissible disease control programs already being supported under the&#13;
PRISS project). In fact, most of these activities, under the third component, will concentrate&#13;
primarily on the thirteen provinces, given their mortality and morbidity patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.07   The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period plus one year to&#13;
complete disbursements, at an approximate total cost of US$118.8 million equivalent and would&#13;
complement donor intervention in the sector (Annex 1). It would consist of three components:&#13;
(a)    Improving access to essential curative and preventive health care in the thirteen provinces&#13;
targeted under the project.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening the safe motherhood program in all its aspects within the thirteen provinces.&#13;
(c)    Maintaining support for priority health programs nationwide.&#13;
Improving access to essential curative and preventive health care services (US$45. 1 million)&#13;
3.08   The project would strengthen  the capacity of the ESSBs, mobile clinics, and outreach&#13;
workers to deliver effective basic curative and preventive care. Special emphasis would be placed&#13;
on rehabilitating curative services to restore public confidence in the services offered and in the&#13;
efficacy of preventive care. This component would finance activities aimed at strengthening the&#13;
physical infrastructure, the specific technical functions, the overall organization and delivery of&#13;
services within health centers and the mobile clinics and the availability of drugs in health facilities.&#13;
3.09   During project preparation, the functions of each type of ESSB were reviewed so that the&#13;
technical capacity and personnel requirements could be accurately estimated. The functions of&#13;
mobile clinics and outreach workers were also assessed.  It was also agreed during project&#13;
preparation that--during the first phase of the project--resources should be used first to improve&#13;
existing health care facilities. Once these facilities were fully operational the system would be&#13;
expanded. This decision was taken to avoid another situation such as that which arose under the&#13;
Health Development Project, when twenty health centers built and equipped in 1992 and 1993 had&#13;
to remain closed until June 1995 for lack of personnel . During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that a human resources development plan would be discussed and agreed upon by December&#13;
31, 1997 [para 6.03 (a)i]. This plan will take into account the mobile strategy. It will include&#13;
redeployment mechanisms, the profile of personnel to be trained, training strategies, and staffing&#13;
plans for new health centers under the project. The standards for infrastructure expansion and&#13;
rehabilitation prepared by MSP in 1994 (PECS, Plan d'extension de la couverture sanitaire) would&#13;
apply under the proposed project. The conclusions of an analysis of the mobile strategy (clinics and&#13;
outreach health workers) carried out during preparation have been taken into account in the project&#13;
design. The provincial health administration and the physician in charge of the health center would&#13;
have primary responsibility for ensuring that the different types of ESSBs deliver the relevant&#13;
package of services agreed upon. The central Directorate of Hospitals and Ambulatory Care would&#13;
coordinate the effort. In the public pharmaceutical sector, activities proposed are based on the&#13;
conclusions of a major sector study carried out during project preparation.&#13;
3.10   This component would finance the following elements:&#13;
(a)    The  construction  of  about  80  communal  health  centers  and  the  renovation&#13;
rehabilitation/reconstruction of 160 health centers, 25 rural dispensaries, and 15 rural&#13;
hospitals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(b)    The purchase of about 340 motorcycles for outreach health workers (to complement the&#13;
USAID intervention, which would provide the mobile clinics in the selected areas);&#13;
(c)    The provision of medical and non-medical materials and equipment necessary for the&#13;
delivery of essential curative and preventive services at the clinic, by the mobile team, and&#13;
by the outreach worker. (The in-country training of health personnel in technical matters&#13;
related to service delivery, as well as in management and planning of activities, would be&#13;
financed primarily by USAID and UNFPA);&#13;
(e)    The reorganization of services to be delivered by health centers, mobile clinics, and&#13;
outreach workers would necessitate the organization of workshops at the local level and&#13;
additional recurrent costs for follow-up, supervision, and the strengthening of the capacity&#13;
of provincial health care workers. Provincial officers would be given more flexibility to&#13;
plan and organize their work in order to tailor services, including outreach activities, to&#13;
local needs; and&#13;
(f)    a set of activities aimed at improving the access of the rural population to basic curative&#13;
drugs, including: (a) the purchase of drugs according to a list agreed upon by type of health&#13;
facility; (b) the strengthening of the information system and the purchase of 6 vehicles at&#13;
the procurement unit of Berrechid in an effort to improve the management and the&#13;
distribution of drugs; and (c) the strengthening of the national laboratory for quality control&#13;
(Laboratoire National de contr6le de Medicaments/ LNCM), mainly through the&#13;
improvement of its infrastructure, the purchase of technical materials and equipment.&#13;
Unlike what was done under the HDS and the HSIP projects, the financing of drugs by the&#13;
Bank under this project will be linked to the implementation of these above-mentioned&#13;
actions in the public pharmaceutical sector on which agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
[(para.6.03 a(ii)].&#13;
Strengthening the Safe Motherhood Program (US$30.8 million)&#13;
3.11   This program will be one of the highest priorities of MSP over the next five years. A&#13;
strategic document on the subject being prepared will outline several specific actions the MSP is&#13;
planning, both at the national level and in targeted regions where the need is great. There is already&#13;
agreement that in the proposed project's targeted districts, all aspects of the safe motherhood&#13;
program would be addressed (except information, education, and communication (IEC) financed by&#13;
USAID [US$6 million]): the availability of modern FP methods, the reorganization of prenatal&#13;
services including support to the iron-deficiency anemia program, the improvement of maternity&#13;
wards, the use of community health workers (such as traditional birth attendants/Kablat) where&#13;
needed, and the establishment of a sound evacuation and referral system to transfer women in&#13;
danger from communities and ESSBs to the maternity wards of provincial hospitals. Maximizing&#13;
the impact of these activities would require a high degree of initiative and commitment by competent&#13;
provincial officials, who would have to organize and monitor service delivery.&#13;
3.12   Available resources (human, material, and financial) in the thirteen provinces would also&#13;
have to be concentrated in strategic areas, which would be chosen according to specific criteria.&#13;
Some maternity units would therefore be closed, while other delivery units in strategic areas (health&#13;
centers with maternity beds, rural maternity wards) would be reinforced. Equipment and personnel&#13;
would be redistributed and redeployed in these reinforced units. But this approach will necessitate&#13;
the implementation of a performing emergency referral system and well-trained personnel. These&#13;
activities would complement EU and UNFPA Safe Motherhood interventions. Provincial health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
officials would have the primary responsibility for the implementation of this component, which&#13;
would be coordinated by the MSP's Directorate of Hospitals and Ambulatory Care and the&#13;
Directorate of Population.&#13;
3.13   This component would finance the following interventions:&#13;
(a)    The purchase of contraceptives.  USAID has officially informed the Government that,&#13;
beginning 1999, it will no longer finance these purchases.  The MSP has therefore&#13;
requested that the proposed project bear these considerable costs toward the end of the&#13;
project, given contraceptives proven effectiveness for reducing rates of fertility and&#13;
maternal and infant mortality.&#13;
(b)    Reorganizing the provision of prenatal services to increase the coverage of pregnant&#13;
women. This reorganization would require greater physician involvement at the health&#13;
center level, improved waiting areas (an aspect already taken into account under the first&#13;
project component), and trained personnel able to detect high-risk pregnancies and to make&#13;
the necessary referrals'; the provision of iron in the context of the iron-deficiency anemia&#13;
program;&#13;
(c)    Renovating and rehabilitating 55 rural maternity wards (health centers with maternity&#13;
wards), and 13 obstetric wards within selected provincial hospitals in the priority zones.&#13;
(d)    Purchasing materials, equipment, and drugs to meet the minimum requirements needed to&#13;
handle basic obstetrical emergencies.&#13;
(e)    Setting up a medical evacuation system, including defining referral norms and purchasing&#13;
126 ambulances.&#13;
(f)    Training, where needed, of traditional birth attendants (Kablats) to handle home deliveries&#13;
better.&#13;
Maintaining support for selected priority health programs nationwide (Base cost US$ 41.9 million)&#13;
3.14   The project would support Morocco's Transmissible Disease Program, including efforts to&#13;
control those diseases targeted under the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI). This support&#13;
was initiated under the Health Sector Investment Project (HSIP) project. At the time of the mid-&#13;
term  review of this project (May 1994), the Government formally requested Bank support to&#13;
maintain the performance of these priority health programs nationwide. Given their public health&#13;
implications, the Bank felt that it was appropriate to provide such support to these programs and&#13;
not only to the thirteen provinces. This decision was also based on the fact that in the Middle&#13;
East/North Africa crescent, transmissible diseases account for 51% of the burden of diseases. The&#13;
EPI--along with the Tuberculosis Control Program--would be the major beneficiary of this support.&#13;
Other programs would include the Acute Respiratory Infections Program (ARI) in the areas not&#13;
supported by AfDB as well as programs to combat schistosomiasis, infectious ocular diseases,&#13;
I The recruitment and training of midwives and obstetrician-gynecologists will be part of the&#13;
human resources strategy MSP will develop. These categories of personnel are in very short supply&#13;
in Morocco and are concentrated in major urban areas. Most of the targeted provinces have fewer&#13;
than one obstetrician-gynecologist for every 10,000 expected births.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), leprosy, malaria, and hygiene and sanitation programs. As&#13;
mentioned in para. 3.06, it is expected that approximately half of the resources under this&#13;
component would be concentrated in the targeted provinces, given their mortality and morbidity&#13;
patterns. (For objectives of these various health programs, see Annex 4). The MSP directorate of&#13;
Epidemiology and Prevention of Diseases, in collaboration with provincial health officials, would&#13;
have the responsibility for implementing this component.  The high cost of drugs for these&#13;
programs, especially the tuberculosis control program, EPI, ARI and STDs partly explains the high&#13;
cost of this component.&#13;
3.15   Under this component, the proposed project would finance:&#13;
(a)    The provision of drugs and vaccines, essential materials and equipment relevant to the&#13;
different programs. The financing of drugs and vaccines under this component will also be&#13;
linked to the implementation of the set of activities described in para.3. 10(f).&#13;
(b)    The purchase of 7 vehicles and 32 motorcycles which will replace partly the deficient&#13;
logistic system and will strengthen supervision and monitoring of programs.&#13;
(c)    IEC activities to motivate the population, enroll their support and induce behavioral&#13;
changes.&#13;
(c)    Additional recurrent costs for the integrated monitoring, supervision, on-the-job training&#13;
necessary to carry out these programs, improving their performance, and for their&#13;
evaluation. These resources will help strengthen the provincial level which depends on&#13;
them to implement these programs successfully.&#13;
IV. COSTS, FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Summary of Project Costs&#13;
4.01   Total costs of the three projects which, together, constitute the SPP/BAJ are estimated at&#13;
US$266.0 million. Total project costs are estimated at US$118.8 million equivalent, including&#13;
US$20.8 million for contingencies (17.5%) and US$10.4 million for taxes (9%).  The foreign&#13;
exchange component is equivalent to US$68.2 million, representing 63% of total project costs&#13;
excluding taxes. A summary of project costs appears in Table 4.1 and in Annex 5.&#13;
4.02   Contingency allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance--for unforeseen&#13;
physical variations--equal to US$9.7 million (9%  of total project cost excluding taxes).  Price&#13;
contingencies between negotiations and project completion are estimated at US$11.1 million (10%&#13;
of total project costs excluding taxes). The following annual rates have been applied: 5% per year&#13;
for local costs, 2.6% per year for foreign costs.&#13;
4.03   Foreign exchange component. The foreign exchange component is estimated as follows:&#13;
construction: 25%; medical supplies, equipment, computers and vehicles: 70%; furniture: 25%;&#13;
foreign specialists and training abroad: 90%; locally recruited specialists, local training, local&#13;
seminars: 10%. The resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US$68.2 million.&#13;

4.04   Customs duties and taxes. Directly imported goods and goods procured locally average an&#13;
import duty and taxes of 20%. Indirect taxes on civil works are estimated at 15%.&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
4.05    The financing of the project would consist of (a) a Bank loan of US$68.0 million equivalent&#13;
(63% of total project costs excluding taxes), and (b) a Government contribution of US$50.8 million&#13;
equivalent, which includes US$10.4 niillion in taxes (see table 4.2). The Bank loan would cover&#13;
100% of foreign expenditures. The Govermment would finance the small balance of foreign costs,&#13;
the local costs, taxes and operating costs associated with the implementation, administration, and&#13;
supervision of the project, including staff salaries and architectural and engineering services.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were given that the Government take all necessary measures to&#13;
ensure that adequate and timely financial arrangements were in place at all times for the continued&#13;
and successful operation of the project. These would include provision for counterpart funds and&#13;
the establishment of individual project line in the MSP budget of July 1st, 1996 [para. 6.03b(ii)].&#13;
During negotiations, retroactive financing up to 10% of the loan amount was agreed upon,&#13;
excluding drugs [para. 6.036 (iii)J.&#13;
4.06   Although UNFPA, EU. USAID and UNICEF have expressed their interest in participating&#13;
in BAJ I Health, no formal cofinancing has been secured at this stage. However, the project design&#13;
has taken into account actions already undertaken by these agencies in the targeted provinces.&#13;

C. Economic Analysis&#13;
Alternatives and effectiveness&#13;
4.07    The project is part of a major social program which is the backbone of the latest country&#13;
assistance strategy (CAS). It involves the provision of essential public goods, and addresses equity&#13;
issues in the distribution of these goods. In the rural areas of Morocco, the public sector is in a better&#13;
position to deliver these goods since the private sector is basically concentrated in major urban areas&#13;
and given the fact that no incentive system has been created to encourage its involvement in the rural&#13;
areas. The decision was made by the Government to target the poorest areas of the country, in an effort&#13;
to maximize the impact of project inputs on vulnerable groups. The benefits and the number of&#13;
beneficiaries are stated in para. 5.01. In the absence of this project, health indicators would only&#13;
worsen in the targeted where infant mortality already peaks at 145 per 1,000 in some districts (more&#13;
than twice the national average). Cost recovery at the basic level is being envisaged and MSP is about&#13;
to implement actions over the next five years, to improve the overall sector efficiency, in order to protect&#13;
core programs which will be implemented under the project and the PAS. The increase in the MSP&#13;
budget for basic services will be monitored annually through the PEP process, [para. 4.111.&#13;
4.08   The study being carried out in Morocco and other Maghreb countries in collaboration with&#13;
the Bank to determine the burden of diseases of a broad variety of health problems will permit cost-&#13;
effective packages of health interventions to be defined for these countries. Such studies have been&#13;
carried out in other similar countries and give some order of magnitude of the expected benefits of&#13;
the project:&#13;
(a) The prevention of one case of tuberculosis (TB) prevents 20-28 new infections over the&#13;
approximate two-year course of infectious TB. TB tends to burden one of the most productive age&#13;
groups of society and these deaths affect the family unit significantly. In Morocco, the incidence of&#13;
TB per year is still high (30,000 new cases per year). The unit cost of adding BCG vaccine to an&#13;
immunization program is estimated to be under US$10 as opposed to US$160-217 for the treatment&#13;
for a TB case. It should be noted however, that BCG vaccine is effective mostly for the 0-15&#13;
years of age. Therefore, short-course chemotherapy needs also to be considered and has one-third&#13;
greater benefit in term of cost-effectiveness as compared to standard chemotherapy.&#13;
(b) An integrated antenatal/delivery care program can induce a reduction of 25-50% in maternal&#13;
mortality, of 12.5-25% in perinatal mortality and 1 % in low birth weight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(c) In addition to maternal morbidity and mortality, FP programs have economic and welfare gains&#13;
from improved control of level and timing of fertility.&#13;
(d) It was estimated that iron deficiency anemia (the most prevalent nutrition problem in Morocco)&#13;
costs the economy well over $200 million per year in lost work productivity and in excess health&#13;
and education expenditures. The cost of a national iron supplementation program (fortification of&#13;
wheat and iron pills for pregnant women) would be about US$5 million per year. The payoff is&#13;
clearly high.&#13;
(e) Preliminary results of the Maghreb Health Priorities Study for Morocco (based on mortality data&#13;
only) show that infectious diseases represent 45% of the Burden of disease. These data reinforce the&#13;
decision taken by MSP to give priority to these diseases under the project. The project is also&#13;
expected to improve access to basic care (defined as less than 5 kilometers from an ESSB) from 47&#13;
to 60% --currently more than half of the targeted population live at more than 6 kilometers from an&#13;
ESSB and 43% at more than 10 kilometers.) The number of visits to an ESSB would grow from&#13;
0.32 to 0.97 in those provinces.&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs&#13;
4.09   Incremental recurrent costs. The proposed project would generate additional recurrent&#13;
costs for the recruitment of medical and administrative staff for the proposed new facilities. But the&#13;
redeployment of existing staff and other cost-saving measures would reduce the cost of new&#13;
recruitment substantially. Other incremental recurrent costs would include additional health related&#13;
materials (drugs, vaccines, medical materials), the maintenance of the new facilities, and costs&#13;
associated with operating medical equipment, vehicles, and ambulances.  The total additional&#13;
recurrent base costs generated by these items would reach by the end of the project an estimated&#13;
US$16 million equivalent (or 3% of the Ministry of Public Health's recurrent budget projected for&#13;
year 2000). Detailed incremental costs are presented in the project implementation manual.&#13;
Cost recovery&#13;
4.10   Until recently, cost recovery schemes were not officially envisaged at the basic health care&#13;
level. However, given the insufficient amount allocated to drugs in the rural areas and the&#13;
budgetary constraints, MSP officials have agreed to launch a cost recovery study for drugs at the&#13;
basic level, and to integrate the conclusions of such a study in the project [(6.03a(ii)]. UNICEF will&#13;
participate in the implementation of this study.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
4.11   The project is part of the SAP which be monitored through the PEP process. Recurrent&#13;
costs induced by the project [para. 4.09] will have to be addressed by the corresponding annual&#13;
increase in expenditures at the end of the project. During negotiations, agreement was reached on&#13;
the undertaking and updating each year a multiyear rolling public expenditure program for the health&#13;
sector and transmittal of the program to the Bank by July 31st of each year beginning in 1997 [para.&#13;
6. 03b(i)].  It is therefore unlikely that project activities will stop at the end of project&#13;
implementation. In addition, agreement on a set of dated covenants regarding the pharmaceutical&#13;
sector were reached at negotiations [para 6.03a(ii)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
D. Management and Implementation&#13;
Program implementation&#13;
4.12   The national Social Development Strategv (SDS) and the SPP/BAJ would be monitored by a&#13;
steering committee made up of all concerned ministers. Such a committee, the Comitl de Suivi de la&#13;
Strategie Sociale (CSSS), already exists, it is assisted by a Secretariat. which is housed in the Ministry&#13;
of Population's Department of Planning, and is already in place. The Secretariat would be responsible&#13;
for monitoring the objectives of the SPP/BAJ and would also be the liaison between technical&#13;
ministries, the CSSS, and the donor community (Annex 2). In parallel, an Observatory for Monitoring&#13;
Living Conditions was created to monitor social conditions in the Kingdom. The formal establishment,&#13;
vwithin the Ministry of Population, of the Observatory was a condition of Board presentation [para.&#13;
6.04a].&#13;
4.13   To simplify implementation and avoid the creation of an overall project implementation and&#13;
coordination unit, program activities would be implemented under three distinct projects and&#13;
financed by three distinct loans. The first loan, for the Basic Education Project, would comprise the&#13;
activities to be implemented by the Ministries of Education, and Employment and Social Affairs.&#13;
The second loan, for the proposed Basic Health Project, would comprise the activities to be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Public Health. The third loan, for the Coordination and Monitoring&#13;
of Social Programs and Labor Promotion Project, would comprise the activities to be implemented&#13;
by the Ministries of Interior (Promotion Nationale), and Population.&#13;
4.14   The multiple activities included under the SPP/BAJ will require careful programming and&#13;
coordination of inputs from the various implementation agencies at the central, provincial and&#13;
community levels. The individual impact of the three projects, too, could only be measured if&#13;
implementation were sufficiently well-coordinated for each to build on the efforts of the others. To&#13;
ensure that SPP/BAJ activities were implemented in a coordinated manner, both at the grass-roots&#13;
level and in the central ministries, the Government would be asked to commit itself to the setting up&#13;
of a Program Management Information System (PMIS) by the Secretariat, and to the&#13;
implementation of the PMIS by the line ministries. The staff needed to run the PMIS in the&#13;
Secr&amp;tariat and in the MSP should be in place in time so that the PMIS could be launched in place&#13;
no later than December 31, 1997 [para. 6.03c(i)]. The data input would be performed by the&#13;
implementation staff at the provincial level and at the departmental and division levels in the&#13;
ministries.&#13;
Proiect implementation&#13;
4.15   Project activities would be implemented at two different levels: (i) at a central level, by the&#13;
ministry's departments, and (ii) at the provincial level by  Provincial Medical Officers.&#13;
Implementation coordination would be performed by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) located&#13;
within the Ministry of Health' s Planning and Financial Resources department.  The Project&#13;
Coordinator would be appointed by December 31, 1996 [para. 6.03c(ii)]. While the implementation&#13;
record of the MSP is mixed, a reorganization of the ministry and a change in key staff improved its&#13;
implementation capability. Moreover, various departments within the Ministry of Health have&#13;
developed expertise with procurement and disbursement procedures related to Bank-financed&#13;
projects. As experienced with previous Bank financed projects, implementation of the proposed&#13;
project would also be hampered by generic, country-wide problems such as cumbersome&#13;
administrative procedures and the requirement that all documents pertaining to contracts and&#13;
payments be reviewed in advance. An ongoing study of reasons for delays in the payment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
suppliers should help to improve some of these generic problems [para. 6.01c]. The Government&#13;
would ensure that an action plan to improve the management of the proposed project, based on&#13;
results of the study be presented to the Bank for discussions before March 31, 1997, and that&#13;
implementation of the recommendations be launched no later than October 31, 1997 [para.&#13;
6.03(c(iii)]. A project implementation volume has been prepared, which will be used as a reference&#13;
during the project's execution.&#13;
4.16   Project Coordination Unit (PCU). A PCU, located within the Planning and Financial&#13;
Resources Department of the Ministry of Health, would be responsible for overall project&#13;
programming, coordination, and reporting. While implementation would be carried out by the line&#13;
departments, the PCU would oversee the performance of such specific administrative tasks as&#13;
programming, accounting, and monitoring. By December 1996, therefore, the PCU would need at&#13;
least two additional persons to make sure that project programming and monitoring tools are being&#13;
properly used, plus a qualified accountant to monitor the accounting records procedures in use in&#13;
various implementing departments [para. 6.03c(ii)].&#13;
4.17   Department of Equipment (DEM). This department would delegate the procurement of&#13;
civil works contracts to the MSP's provincial officers. To oversee civil works implementation and to&#13;
coordinate the delegated activities, the DEM would need at least three technical staff members. This&#13;
staff would need to have experience in monitoring such type of contracts and to be well-acquainted&#13;
with both the technical and financial aspects of Bank procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
The technical team would be headed by a senior implementation specialist with experience in&#13;
handling complex projects.  The project's technical team  would have to be established by&#13;
December 1996. Most equipment would be procured directly by the DEM, with only a few items&#13;
being procured at the provincial level. The DEM already has sufficient know-how and expertise to&#13;
manage the procurement of equipment.&#13;
4.18   Concerned line departments would handle procurement for all project activities related to&#13;
health programs (immunization, tuberculosis control, acute respiratory infections, leprosy, etc.).&#13;
These departments have implemented similar activities under earlier Bank-financed projects and&#13;
have the necessary procurement expertise. But like the DEM, they lack systematic planning skills.&#13;
The PCU, using the PMIS tool,  would help line ministry departments to set up adequate&#13;
programming, accounting, and monitoring tools and would recommend corrective measures where&#13;
needed to ensure that project programming, accounting, and monitoring were up to standard.&#13;
4.19   Activities delegated to Provincial Officers of the Ministry of Health. Provincial MSP&#13;
officers would be responsible for the implementation of smaller scale civil works, such as the&#13;
building of rural clinics, for which procedures are well known and decentralized services are&#13;
sufficiently staffed.&#13;
4.20   Program   Management  Information  System  (PMIS). The  responsibilities  for&#13;
administering the PMIS would be divided as follows:&#13;
(a) Provincial level. By December 31, 1996, a SPP/BAJ focal point would be appointed in&#13;
each province to coordinate and monitor the implementation of all of the SPP/BAJ activities&#13;
delegated by the various line ministries and to ensure that the PMIS data and information&#13;
was kept up to date [para. 6.03c(ii)]. The various provincial delegates would provide the&#13;
provincial SPP/BAJ focal point with all pertinent information about project activities. The&#13;
provincial focal point would ensure that the data was entered into the system and&#13;
would--with the assistance of this tool--prepare the annual provincial implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
program.  The PMIS would generate implementation progress reports and reports on&#13;
various indicators and financial benchmarks. The PMIS would be linked to a Geographical&#13;
Information System. The PMIS would be designed in such a manner as to allow for the&#13;
gradual expansion of the system to include other data required by the Governor or other&#13;
users.&#13;
(b) Mlinistry department or division level. Each department involved with the SPP/BAJ&#13;
would be responsible for managing the implementation of its respective project activities&#13;
using the PMIS. To that end, each concerned department would appoint a staff-member to&#13;
manage the PMIS. Several different departments and divisions within the Ministry of&#13;
Health would be responsible for project activities under a ministry-appointed SPP/BAJ&#13;
coordinator. This ministry-level health coordinator would oversee and coordinate the work&#13;
of the departmental and divisional SPP/BAJ coordinators and would be expected to ensure&#13;
the proper use of the PMIS.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.21   All goods and services to be financed by the loan would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's guidelines. For ICB procedures, the Government would use the Bank standard bidding&#13;
documents, available in French at the time of project negotiations (March9s de travaux--Taille&#13;
Moyenne et Marches de Fournitures). Procurement of goods and services would be undertaken by&#13;
the concerned line ministries at the central level, by provincial representatives delegated by the line&#13;
ministries, and by the communities themselves. NCB procedures at these three levels have been&#13;
reviewed by the Bank. The procedures agreed upon are in conformity with general Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines with respect to economy, efficiency, equal opportunity to all eligible bidders, development of&#13;
local industry, and transparency (Table 4.3 below summarizes the procurement arrangements for&#13;
goods and services).&#13;

4.22   Civil works.  The project would include the construction and rehabilitation of over&#13;
400 facilities (health centers, dispensaries and rural hospitals). Works contracts would be of small&#13;
value (from US$8,000 to US$100,000 equivalent per facility), and would be distributed over a large&#13;
rural area. As demonstrated under previous and ongoing loans, such contracts do not normally&#13;
attract foreign firms or local funds. The implementation of those small works would be delegated to&#13;
provincial delegations and all civil works would be carried out in accordance with NCB procedures.&#13;
NCB procedures at the central (ministry), and provincial levels have been reviewed by the Bank and&#13;
found acceptable. Civil works contracts of less than US$20.000, up to an aggregate of US$500.000&#13;
equivalent, for the remodeling of small health facilities in remote areas may be carried out by force&#13;
account with the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
4.23   Goods.&#13;
(a) Contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent each would be&#13;
procured through ICB (US$24.8 million plus US$46.8 million for drugs), with the&#13;
exception of furniture which could be procured through  NCB.   Such furniture,&#13;
manufactured by local suppliers, is of excellent quality, below international prices, and&#13;
delivery and supply would be appropriate for this project.&#13;
(b) Contracts for goods costing US$100,000-500,000 equivalent would be procured through&#13;
NCB. (US$11.6 million).&#13;
(c) Contracts for goods that the Bank agrees to be of proprietary nature (such as computer&#13;
software, books, and reference materials) could be awarded through direct contracting after&#13;
negotiations with proprietors or publishers in accordance with procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. (US$6.2 million).&#13;
(d) Contracts for goods costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each could be awarded&#13;
through shopping procedures on the basis of three price quotations from suppliers.&#13;
(US$1.1 million)&#13;
4.24   Consultant services.  Consultants financed under the project would be selected in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for consultants. Consultant services would consist of foreign&#13;
or local specialized services to conduct specific studies or to offer short-term advice. The project&#13;
would also finance local seminars. A large number of consultant contracts would be related to civil&#13;
works (architectural and engineering services).  The procedures under which such services are&#13;
engaged are well-known and efficient.&#13;
4.25   Contracts and contract review&#13;
(a)    Items to be disbursed on the basis of proof of services would be subject to Bank&#13;
review as described in Annex 6.&#13;
(b) Works. Contracts exceeding US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review.  Contracts below  US$500,000 equivalent, exept for activities subject to lump sum&#13;
disbursement, would be subject to ex post Bank review.&#13;
(c)  Goods.  To ensure compliance with Bank procurement guidelines, procurement&#13;
documentation for all contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Contracts below US$500,000 in value would be&#13;
subject to ex post review by Bank missions.&#13;
(d)    Consultant services and training. Procurement documentation for all contracts&#13;
for consulting firms, estimated to exceed the equivalent of US$100,000 would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank. Procurement documentation for all contracts for the employment&#13;
of individuals or single source selection of firms estimated to exceed the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 would also be subject to prior review by the Bank. Procurement documentation&#13;
for all contracts for consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent and&#13;
US$50,000 for all contracts for the employment of individuals or single source selection of&#13;
firms estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 would be limited to terms of&#13;
references only.&#13;
(e) Contracts and financial data related to activities subject to lump sum disbursement&#13;
procedures will not be subject to post review but will be subject to technical audit (para. 4.29).&#13;
4.26   Disbursement. The project would be implemented over a period of five years. Including a&#13;
12-month disbursement lag, the closing date would be December 31, 2003. The loan would&#13;
disburse according to the categories and schedule shown in Tables 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.&#13;

4.27    Documentation. In accordance with regular Government procedures, the required supporting&#13;
documents would be retained by the implementing agencies for at least one year after the Bank received&#13;
the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation would be&#13;
made available for review by auditors and visiting staff upon request. Documentation for contracts&#13;
subject to lump sum disbursement would consist of a "proof of services". This is a certificate&#13;
established by the borrower, confirming that the specific activity has been implemented in accordance&#13;
with agreed standards and criteria. (Annex 6). The content and procedure to establish a proof of service&#13;
was presented in a format agreed upon during negotiations [para. 6.03c(iv)]. Both the disbursement by&#13;
lump sum and the documentation by proof of services are innovative, result oriented methods aiming at&#13;
simplifying procedures and accelerating project disbursement, while giving more initiative to the&#13;
beneficiaries (especially communities); they concur with the directions set in the new Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. For expenditures under contracts above the prior&#13;
review thresholds, full documentation would be required. All other expenditures would be disbursed&#13;
based on statement of expenditures (SOE).&#13;
4.28   Special Account. To reduce the number of claims submitted to the Bank, the Governrent&#13;
may establish, maintain, and operate--under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank--a Special&#13;
Account, in which the Bank would make an initial deposit of up to US$5.0 million. This special&#13;
account would be located in the General Treasury of the Ministry of Finance and would be&#13;
replenished every month, or whenever the undisbursed balance of the account would fall below an&#13;
amount equal to one third or less of the amount of the initial deposit, whichever came first.&#13;
4.29   Accounts and audits. Each department responsible for the implementation of the project in&#13;
the Ministry of Health would maintain separate accounts for all project activities in conformance with&#13;
international accounting practices.  Project accounts would be audited in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (World&#13;
Bank, March 1982). Activities subject to reimbursement on the basis of proof of services rendered&#13;
would be audited in accordance with OD  10.60, para. 48.   For technical audits,   both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
reimbursement claims using SOEs and applications for replenishment of special expenditures from&#13;
the Special Account would be required to be certified by an independent expert rather than by an&#13;
independent auditor. The Bank would be provided with an audit report of such scope and detail as the&#13;
Bank might reasonably request (including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursement against a&#13;
certified statement of expenditures and a certified statement of proof of service rendered) within the six&#13;
months following the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
Supervision. monitorinR. and evaluation&#13;
4.30   Project preparation.  The Secretariat has de facto taken over the responsibility for&#13;
coordinating the preparation of the three projects. The Secretariat has convened a number of meetings&#13;
with other concerned ministries, and has organized a workshop on monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
SDS. Bids would be launched as soon as the corresponding budgets were available. Provincial&#13;
delegations would start preparing bid documents as soon as the ministries delegated the implementation&#13;
of those activities and provided corresponding budgets. But because of budgetary planning, payment,&#13;
and disbursement lags, during the first year of implementation the loan would disburse only the amount&#13;
corresponding to the initial deposit to the Special Account.&#13;
4.31   Project implementation review.  The Ministry of Health would prepare an annual&#13;
implementation progress report of a scope and in the detail agreed upon by the Government and the&#13;
Bank and including (a) a review of progress achieved in the implementation of the project based on&#13;
selected monitoring indicators agreed upon, (b) projected sector and project expenditures for the&#13;
year, and (c) programs for project activities in the selected provinces. The report would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than September 30 of each year, beginning in 1997 [para. 6.03d(ii)]&#13;
and reviewed jointly. The Secretariat would collect and review sectoral reports issued for each of&#13;
the three BAJ projects, and incorporates them in an annual program implementation report. A&#13;
midterm project implementation review would be conducted by December 31, 1999 [para. 6.03d(i)].&#13;
This midterm review would not only assess the project's implementation progress in greater detail&#13;
but would also assess the extent to which project activities might need to be redirected to achieve the&#13;
objectives of the program. The review would also include a discussion of the follow-up to the study&#13;
on cost recovery for drugs [para. 4. 10].&#13;
4.32   Monitoring indicators. The Government has developed, in coordination with the Bank, a&#13;
list of program and project indicators to follow both the process and the impact of the operations.&#13;
This list of indicators was agreed upon before negotiations [para. 6.02b], and a final agreement on&#13;
baseline values and target values was reached during negotiations [para. 6.03d(iii)]. The list of&#13;
indicators is presented in Annex 7. The value of these indicators would be updated each year and&#13;
incorporated  in the annual implementation report submitted to the Bank each year by the&#13;
Secretariat.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.01   This project specifically targets the needy--especially women and children--and should&#13;
therefore help transfer resources to those who need them most. Improving primary health care&#13;
services in the target areas would benefit some 27% of Morocco's population, including 1.4 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
children under five and 1.05 million women of childbearing age. In addition, the overall population&#13;
would benefit from the improved implementation of public health programs to control tuberculosis,&#13;
malaria, cholera, leprosy, STDs, infectious ocular diseases as well as to improve hygiene and&#13;
nutrition and to expand immunization coverage. Basic curative and preventive health coverage will&#13;
increase from 47 to 60% in targeted areas. If adequately implemented, the project would&#13;
significantly reduce the burden of disease in Morocco and would help reduce the number of&#13;
maternal and child deaths and ensure more equity throughout the health system.&#13;
5.02   Following the burden-of-disease approach recommended in the World Development Report&#13;
1993: Investing in Health, a study is now being carried out in Morocco to assess the number of&#13;
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that could be saved by the implementation of priority health&#13;
programs [para. 4.08] and to identify cost-effective interventions. Rehabilitation of the primary&#13;
health care system would also improve its quality, which would help to restore public confidence in&#13;
the system. In the medium term this would stimulate demand for preventive care services. In&#13;
addition, the reorganization of health administration and services already agreed upon [para. 6.01a]&#13;
would improve the efficiency of the MSP and maximize the impact of the proposed project's health&#13;
activities. The implementation of the Sector Action Plan initiated during project preparation would&#13;
further help to ensure better coordination of aid, and would provide a planning and monitoring tool&#13;
for the MSP. Finally, the integration of health with education and other basic services would result&#13;
in cross sectoral synergy.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.03   The first risk relates to the potentially weak implementing capacity of MSP, especially at the&#13;
provincial level, given the fact that, under the proposed project, provincial health officials would&#13;
have the primary responsibility for planning, implementing and monitoring activities in the targeted&#13;
provinces. To address this risk, MSP is currently in the process of reorganizing the provincial level&#13;
in order to strengthen its managerial capabilities. In addition, during negotiations, agreement wa&#13;
reached on identification and implementation of mechanisms which will strengthen provincial&#13;
participation to planning and decision-making [para. 6.03a(iii)]. The second risk relates to the&#13;
possibility that Morocco may fail to implement the hospital reforms and the financing strategy being&#13;
developed under the Health Management Project, to reorganize at the provincial level and to&#13;
implement the actions proposed for the public pharmaceutical sector. Such situation would threaten&#13;
the sustainability of the entire health system over the long term, since it would effectively prevent&#13;
adequate shifting of resources to the needy, rural population and to more cost-effective&#13;
interventions. These activities are well underway and unlikely to be stopped. In addition, financing&#13;
of drugs under the project is linked to a set of dated covenants [para.6.03a(ii)]. The third risk is&#13;
linked to the lack of adequate counterpart funding, especially for recurrent costs. Discussions and&#13;
agreement with the Ministry of Finance on the Sectoral Action Plan, the flow of funds study and the&#13;
preparation of sectoral public expenditures programs, however, should reduce this risk, which is of&#13;
a generic nature.&#13;
C. Stakeholders' Participation&#13;
5.04   Project preparation has drawn directly or indirectly on the input of final beneficiaries and&#13;
users, including the results of the Bank participatory study on rural women which has suggested that&#13;
maternity related and preventive health care programs should be part of the first cluster of actions to&#13;
improve the daily life of women (World Bank 1995c). During project preparation, provincial&#13;
medical officers of the targeted provinces were involved in the definition and planning of activities&#13;
to be financed under the project. Three regional workshops were organized between November 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
and January 1995 to discuss with them the project objectives and the priority activities it should&#13;
address.  Different surveys were carried out in five of the targeted provinces, including a&#13;
beneficiary assessment and a survey of the concerns of medical and paramedical personnel (see&#13;
Annex 8 for list of studies carried out). They were financed under a Japanese Grant.  The&#13;
conclusions of these surveys have been integrated into project design.  Finally, the other two&#13;
projects of the SPP/BAJ Program have also been prepared with the participation of actual actors and&#13;
potential beneficiaries, thus ensuring that the integrated activities envisaged under the program&#13;
would coincide with real needs perceived by the targeted population, and would mobilize those in&#13;
charge of implementing the measures aimed at meeting these needs.&#13;
D. Poverty Category&#13;
5.05   The proposed project is part of the SPP program whose entire justification and overarching&#13;
objective is poverty alleviation. Because the proposed Project would target the poorest population of&#13;
the country, especially women and children, it falls squarely in the "Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions".  It would also contribute significantly to the reduction in the global burden of&#13;
disease in vulnerable populations and would help close the gap between urban and rural areas,&#13;
thereby addressing the issue of equity. It is therefore part of the programs of targeted interventions.&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
5.06   The proposed project was determined to be in screening category C and would therefore not&#13;
normally result in significant environmental impact. No Environrmental Assessment (EA) is expected to&#13;
be conducted for this project.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;

SELECTED PROJECT DATA&#13;
Pharmaceutical Sector: Main Recommendations based on the conclusions of the&#13;
major study:&#13;
Main features&#13;
1 Improvement of the operation of the Central Medical Stores (Pharmacie Centrale)&#13;
2. Improvement of budgetary mechanisms for drugs (weaning out of Bank funds)&#13;
3. Study of a cost recovery scheme for essential drugs in primary care facilities&#13;
4. Upgrading of the National Control Laboratory&#13;
5. Pharmacie Centrale (PC)&#13;
6. Procurement:&#13;
The Procurement Unit (PU) would modify its procurement and distribution&#13;
practices to increase their productivity: The PU would start tendering for essential&#13;
drugs with contracts expected to cover two years of consumption, with staged&#13;
deliveries to Berechid (preferably on a monthly basis). The PU will also determine&#13;
a list of products for which deliveries would be undertaken directly by the suppliers&#13;
to the regional warehouses and the SEGMAS. Finally, the PU would experiment a&#13;
system by which the PU would determine the level of prices of drugs for the CHUs&#13;
through tenders, but would leave the purchasing and organization of deliveries to&#13;
the CHUs (i.e. the drugs would not physically enter the PU at any time. These&#13;
various new mechanisms are expected to (a) improve the lead time between&#13;
procurement and distribution of drugs, (b) improve the lead time between&#13;
procurement and distribution of drugs, (b) improve the logistics of drug&#13;
distribution in the public sector, (c) reduce the level of stocks (and the drugs&#13;
reaching their shelf-life) in public sector facilities and (d) improve the adequacy of&#13;
procurement to actual needs.&#13;
7. Improvement of budgetary mechanisms for pharmaceuticals.&#13;
The Ministry of Public Health would increase the budget allocated for drugs over&#13;
the duration of the project, to make sure that public sector financing for&#13;
pharmaceuticals becomes sustainable once Bank financing is over. The Ministry of&#13;
Health would undertake a study of actual needs for essential drugs (including&#13;
contraceptives and micro-nutrients), based on actual consumption rather than&#13;
historical procurement, using the methodology developed by WHO to assess&#13;
pharmaceutical requirements. This study woudl also take private sector supply and&#13;
logistics in consideration to determine the adequate level of budget necessary to&#13;
finance these requirements. The services of Moroccan and international&#13;
consultants to undertake this study would be needed and the Ministry of Public&#13;
&#13;

Health would submit detailed tables to the Ministry of Finance to improve financial&#13;
mechanisms for essential drugs.&#13;
8. Study of cost recovery in primary care facilities&#13;
It is agreed that the availability of drugs in primary and secondary care facilities is&#13;
low, and that many patients who receive a prescription in these facilities actually&#13;
have to purchase drugs from private pharmacies. These patients, who are usually&#13;
the less well-off cannot take advantage of the cheap procurement prices of the PC&#13;
and have to pay a much higher price for equivalent products, or to remain without&#13;
a treatment. Although it is not possible for the moment to envisage full cost&#13;
recovery of drugs in Moroccan public health facilities at the peripheral elvel, the&#13;
issue of the financial sustainability of pharmaceutical supplies at this level requires&#13;
that a study be conducted on the feasability of partial cost recovery of&#13;
pharmaceuticals. The study would explore the willingness to pay of the&#13;
population, the level of actual expenditures incurred at present in poor rural and&#13;
urban areas, the level of drug budgets likely to be available in the future, and the&#13;
technical feasibility (including the legal conditions) of charging for drugs in public&#13;
sector health facilities. The study would also review the conditions for a&#13;
participation of the private sector of pharmaceutical distribution in a scheme that&#13;
would involve partial cost recovery for drugs, and the implications that the&#13;
implementation of the national health insurance have would have on a cost&#13;
recovery scheme. The services of an international consulting firm would be neded&#13;
and would participate with the Government of Morocco in the analysis of the&#13;
results of the study.&#13;
9. Upgrading the National Drug Control Laboratory&#13;
The Laboratoire National de Sante Publique (LNSO) is in charge of the quality&#13;
control of drugs, in particular drugs in the public sector. The LNSP needs to be&#13;
upgraded to take care of the growing needs for quality control of both imported&#13;
and locally produced drugs, and to meet international quality requirements for&#13;
exports (equipment), reagents and basic supplies and training of personnel. By the&#13;
end of the project, the LNSP would be expected to perform high quality controls&#13;
and batches of imported drugs and before release of exports, supervise and control&#13;
the QC laboratories of all Moroccan pharmaceutical manufacturers, and to&#13;
participate in international networks of quality control laboratories.&#13;

PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT UNDER PROOF OF SERVICE&#13;
A "proof of service" is a certificate established by the Government confirning that the specific&#13;
operation, service or activity has been implemented in accordance with agreed standards, criteria or&#13;
terms of references which have been reviewed by the Bank at priori. For a "certificate of proof of&#13;
service" (Certificate) to be conform the following procedures would have to be followed:&#13;
(a) By June of each year, a yearly program of activities planned to be implemented during the next&#13;
fiscal year, will need to be established for each of the concerned communities. This program will be&#13;
established by the delegates at the provincial levels, submitted for review and clearance to the&#13;
respective line ministries and for approval to the Bank.&#13;
(b) Budgets, corresponding to the approved list of activities will be made available by the line&#13;
ministries to the provincial delegations. For the construction of primary school facilities, each&#13;
community will include the necessary funds in its annual budget.&#13;
(c) Activities subject to lump sum disbursement procedures will be procured:&#13;
(i) in accordance with National Procurement Procedures&#13;
(ii) for civil works: in accordance with agreed standards or architectural drawings&#13;
reviewed at priori by the Bank; and;&#13;
(iii) for training and seminars in accordance with agreed terms of references established for&#13;
each type of training or seminar, and reviewed by the Bank at priori.&#13;
(iv) Contracts and financial data related to activities subject to lump sum disbursement&#13;
procedures will not be subject to post review.&#13;
(d) Upon completion of the activity, the ministry's representative, accompanied by a technical&#13;
staff (architect or engineer for civil works, medical doctor for health related activities, etc.) will&#13;
inspect the completed facility or review the training/seminar, and issue a Certificate of completion&#13;
and/or a Certificate confirming that the training/seminar took place and was delivered as planned.&#13;
This technical Certificate will certify that the described activity has been implemented in&#13;
accordance with the agreed standards, criteria or terms of references, and will be established in a&#13;
format and content acceptable to the Bank. Because the disbursement amount is not a&#13;
percentage of a contract amount, and because the item has been procured in accordance with&#13;
National Procurement Procedures, it will not be required that the certificate mention the cost of the&#13;
operation, nor the procurement procedure.&#13;
(e) This certificate will be forwarded to the concerned Ministry which will prepare a monthly&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOE), listing all completed activities. The cost of each activity will be&#13;
the average cost as defined in Table 4.5 of the SAR. The amount to be reimbursed will be the lump&#13;
sum amount per activity, as listed in Table 4.5 and in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement. The&#13;
certificate of completion may also trigger other activities such as providing staff for health related&#13;
facilities.&#13;
(f) The annual audit will include an audit (at random) of some of the Certificates. The audit will&#13;
also include a technical audit (at random) of the implemented activities.&#13;

            Specific objectives of the Basic Health
            Project under the Social Priorities Program/Barnamaj al
            Aoulaouiyat al Ijtimaiya program (SPP/BAJ) are: 1) to
            provide a better access to essential preventive and curative
            care from 47 to 60 percent of the targeted population,
            including equitable access to essential drugs; 2) to reduce
            maternal and neonatal mortality in the targeted areas by
            increasing the coverage of prenatal visits from 28 to 50
            percent and assisted deliveries in a medical setting from
            18.5 to 30 percent, and by making available modern family
            planning methods; and 3) to maintain the performance of
            priority public health programs at the national level. The
            project will consist of the following three components: 1)
            increase in access to essential curative and preventive
            health care in the thirteen provinces targeted under the
            project; 2) strengthening of the safe motherhood program in
            all its aspects within the thirteen provinces; and 3)
            continuing support for priority health programs nationwide.
