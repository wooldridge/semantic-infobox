condition and safety in selected roads; (ii) strengthen institutional arrangements for road maintenance,&#13;
including the participation of the private sector and local communities; and (iii) enhance road-related&#13;
economic opportunities for women.&#13;

and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the additional credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project in support of which the proceeds of such additional&#13;
credit are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of&#13;
said Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Independent State of Papua New Guinea and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of&#13;
the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.&#13;
