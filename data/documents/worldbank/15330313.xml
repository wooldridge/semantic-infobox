&#13;
     THE CHAIRMAN:     This speciaJ meeting has been called for&#13;
&#13;
 the purpose of considering my report and recommendations on&#13;
&#13;
 the proposed loan to Italy.    I would like to call on the.&#13;
&#13;
following members of the staff:      first, Mr. Hoar! then Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Prud I Homme, then r&gt;ir. Rembert, and then t.tr. Stevens on.&#13;
&#13;
     I would like to call on Mr. Hoar.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. HOAR:     Mr. ChaiPlTlan, I think there is very little I&#13;
&#13;
need say.    The loan which is before the 8xecutive Directors&#13;
&#13;
is the result of efforts going back over two years to find&#13;
&#13;
a basis on which the Bank could associate itself with the&#13;
&#13;
broad development program for the southern part of Italy.&#13;
&#13;
     Just over a year ago, sir, you were able to indicate to&#13;
&#13;
the Italian Government the basis on which the Bank might be&#13;
&#13;
prepared to make a loan.     This basis was recently accepted&#13;
&#13;
by the Italian Government, Bnd negotiations have just been&#13;
&#13;
concluded for the proposed loan of $10,000,000.&#13;
&#13;
     The loan in its general concept is similar to the loans&#13;
&#13;
recently made to Belgium and to the Belgian Congo.        Indeed,&#13;
&#13;
the approach in those cases was inspired by the proposals&#13;
&#13;
which were originally discussed with the Italian Government&#13;
&#13;
early in   1949.   There are, however, some significant differ-&#13;
&#13;
enees between the two operations, and I would suggest, sir,&#13;
&#13;
that it would be more anpropriate at this pOint for me to make&#13;
&#13;
way for Mr. Prud 'Homme to explain the special features of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Italian loan in detail.&#13;
&#13;
     THS CHAI RNAN:             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
     f.1R. FrtUD   'HO~U\'IE:     Before I go into the question of the&#13;
&#13;
differences between this loan and others, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 refer to a meeting of the Board in which the loan for the&#13;
&#13;
Belgian Congo was approved.              At that meeting, 'Mr. Cope, who&#13;
&#13;
has been my guide since I have been with the Bank, observed&#13;
&#13;
that every loan officer liked to claim that the loan which&#13;
&#13;
he was connected with, or the latest loan he was connected&#13;
&#13;
with, was no doubt one of the most important if not the most&#13;
&#13;
important the Bank had made up to that point.                I am not in a&#13;
&#13;
position to make that particular claim, but I would like to&#13;
&#13;
suggest that if you look at the cover page of the loan&#13;
&#13;
agreement the name of our borrower is certainly the longest&#13;
&#13;
of any of our borrowers to date.              (Laughter. )&#13;
&#13;
     May I say a word about the negotiations?                They went&#13;
&#13;
very cordially.        They were extremely interesting.          We had&#13;
&#13;
a certain number of difficulties which were resolved in the&#13;
&#13;
best kind of an atmosphere, and I would like to pay my&#13;
&#13;
respects to Professor Ferrari-Aggradi, who headed the Italian&#13;
&#13;
delegation, for his comprehension and good temper.&#13;
&#13;
     Perhaps the most interesting thing about this loan is&#13;
&#13;
its dual purpose.         The more we work with the loan the more&#13;
&#13;
We disentangle the various parts of it, and they droD into&#13;
&#13;
two parts, of which one concerns the dollar loan for the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 c&#13;
                                                                 J&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
foreign exchange impact on the Italian economy as a whole,&#13;
&#13;
and the other begins to take on the aspect of a separate&#13;
&#13;
operation, which is the loan of lire by the Cassa represent&#13;
&#13;
ing the counterpart of the Bank's loan.&#13;
&#13;
    Now, we almost get to thinking of them as two loans,&#13;
&#13;
and I think there is an error in that which has to be borne&#13;
&#13;
in mind in connection with the rest of my    rerr~rks.   There&#13;
&#13;
is one loan.   This is the loan of dollars by the Bank to the&#13;
&#13;
Casss for the Italian program.    The Cassa itself will take&#13;
&#13;
the dollars which are disbursed from the loan account, and&#13;
&#13;
it will sell those dollars to the Bank of Italy, purchasing&#13;
&#13;
lire therefor, and will deposit those lire, which are its&#13;
&#13;
lire not the Bank's lire, in a special account from which&#13;
&#13;
it will expend them for certain projects which have been&#13;
&#13;
approved or may be approved in future.&#13;
&#13;
     The differences between this loan and other loans&#13;
&#13;
emerge most clearly in connection wi th the procedures for&#13;
&#13;
disbursement and supervision.     Although that may be a bit&#13;
&#13;
technical as a basis for bringing out the difference, I&#13;
&#13;
should like to do so because I think that is where you get&#13;
&#13;
the most tangible differences.&#13;
&#13;
     There are almost three parts to the loan from the stand-&#13;
&#13;
point of the disbursement and superVision.     The first is&#13;
&#13;
disbursement of the dollars.     The second is the supervision&#13;
&#13;
of the program of the Italian ten-year plan, which, as you&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            !&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
                                                                    6&#13;
                                                                            I&#13;
        can see, is not directly related to the use of the dollars.&#13;
                                                                            \&#13;
        The dollars go for the balance of payments of Italy as a whol~,&#13;
                                                                            !&#13;
        whereas the program which we will look at and 8upeY'vis~&#13;
         IS&#13;
        ~     the program for Southern Italy.   And .finalJy you have the       )f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        use of the lire of which I spoke.&#13;
&#13;
Ii            So, there are almost three aspects to disbursement and&#13;
II&#13;
II      supeI'vision which in a normal loan are rather closely tled&#13;
II      together and here tend to separate.&#13;
1\&#13;
:[&#13;
II            Now, taking them individually on the plan, the plan is&#13;
q&#13;
I:&#13;
'I      so broad in scope that it would be practically out of the&#13;
!I&#13;
Ii      question for the Bank to attempt to follow disbursement&#13;
I   I&#13;
        expenditures in the plan in the way that it normally does on&#13;
Ii&#13;
I&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
i       the basis of disbursement documents, receipted invoices and&#13;
I       things of that sort.   The 100,000,000,000 lire which they&#13;
Ii&#13;
II&#13;
B&#13;
!       appropriate to the Cassa for a year is the equivalent of&#13;
&#13;
        $160,000,000, and there is no doubt or very little doubt that&#13;
&#13;
        that much will be expended in the first year, so that the&#13;
&#13;
        Bank's part in this is one-sixteenth and may be less.     There&#13;
&#13;
        will be thousands of contracts and subcontracts to people who&#13;
&#13;
        are carrying out the works under the plan, and many times&#13;
&#13;
        that number of sheets of paper evidencing expenditures under&#13;
&#13;
        those contracts, so that from an accounting point of View&#13;
&#13;
        it will also be difficult.&#13;
&#13;
              Therefore, speaking still of the disbursement of dollars,&#13;
&#13;
        we will receive from the Cassa a summary statement of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     expenditures, and #e will payout dollars in the proportion&#13;
&#13;
     of $lO,OOO~OOO to lOO~OOO~OOO,OOO lire as those expendltures&#13;
&#13;
     proceed.&#13;
&#13;
             Now, the supervision of the plan is again something&#13;
&#13;
     else.     We cannot supervise the plan through the disbursement&#13;
&#13;
     procedure.     We will supervise the plan through the normal&#13;
&#13;
     means of receivin     progress reports, going over there and&#13;
&#13;
     having a look at the development once in a While, but, most&#13;
i&#13;
&#13;
II   particularly, by c lose contact wi th the I taIian Government&#13;
&#13;
     and with the Cassa, and every indication has been given us&#13;
&#13;
     of a cordial welcome when we go.     I have no doubt that we&#13;
&#13;
     will be able to follow the plan as a whole through normal&#13;
&#13;
     supervisory methods.   ~&#13;
&#13;
             Now, up to that point there has been a certain similar-&#13;
&#13;
     i ty wi th the Congo loan, but I think the similari ty ends&#13;
&#13;
     there.     In the Congo loan, if you recall, we had a project&#13;
&#13;
     which was within the Congo development plan, the otraco,&#13;
&#13;
     which was the heart of the Congo development plan.     The one&#13;
&#13;
     couldn't move without the other.     Here we take a road which&#13;
&#13;
     goes off in a completely different direction.    The projects&#13;
&#13;
     which are selected under this particular operation are not&#13;
&#13;
     even within the development plan for Southern Italy.     They&#13;
&#13;
     are projects which are supplementary to it and have been&#13;
&#13;
     chosen on the Side.&#13;
&#13;
         Before gOing on to a little description of the project&#13;
&amp;#12;I&#13;
J&#13;
I,&#13;
Ii&#13;
,    of the same sort that I have tried to give you on the plan 3&#13;
i&#13;
     I would like to mention one or two other peculiarities about&#13;
&#13;
     this loan if you look at the whole operation from the side,&#13;
&#13;
     so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
          One is that the Cassa, wDJch is the borrower of&#13;
&#13;
     dollars, doesn't want dollars.     In fact, they will have no&#13;
&#13;
     use for dollars.     They can carry out the repair of roads&#13;
&#13;
     and the aqueducts and the drainage of land and the reforesta&#13;
&#13;
     tion very largely with Italian labor and Italian materials.&#13;
&#13;
          Another peculiarity is that, in fact, they don't even&#13;
&#13;
     need the lire.     They have had appropriated to them for the&#13;
&#13;
     first fiscal year, June 30, 1951, 100,000,000,000 lire plus&#13;
&#13;
     part of the appropriation of 100,000,000,000 lire for the&#13;
&#13;
     fiscal year of 1952, and they have only been able to spend a&#13;
&#13;
     fraction of that up to the present time.    I think they were&#13;
&#13;
     very happy, however, to have the Bank come along with this&#13;
&#13;
     idea that we could help finance supplementary or industrial&#13;
&#13;
     projects, because, under the law as it now stands, the Casss&#13;
&#13;
     is not authorized to finance that type of operation.     Itis&#13;
&#13;
     limited more to agricultural and public works types of&#13;
&#13;
     investments.&#13;
&#13;
          Since it was part of the Cassa's idea to try to atnract&#13;
&#13;
     industry to the south as a complementary measure in connectl0&#13;
&#13;
     with the whole plan for the south, it fitted in very nicely.&#13;
&#13;
         The question might be asked why we selected projects at&#13;
&amp;#12;i'&#13;
Ii&#13;
'1   all since they are two steps removed really from the original&#13;
II&#13;
Ii&#13;
II purpose of the loan.       My own judgment, simply from observing&#13;
\&#13;
     how the Bank works, is that it was partly traditional to&#13;
&#13;
     follow the project approach and, secondly, there was no&#13;
If&#13;
I,&#13;
 I&#13;
&#13;
 I   doubt the need to find something tangible to tie this loan to&#13;
 I   You couldn't follow the use of the dollars which you were&#13;
&#13;
I    lending because they were going for the general balance of&#13;
&#13;
1\   payments of Italy as a whole.     It Is very hard to supervise&#13;
&#13;
l&#13;
,I&#13;
 i&#13;
     a program which is so vast.     But this was something quite&#13;
&#13;
     tangible and specific which we could supervise.&#13;
&#13;
          Now, here disbursement and supervision come together,&#13;
&#13;
     whereas in the case of the dollars you disburse on the basis&#13;
&#13;
     of the program and you then supervise the program independent&#13;
 I&#13;
     ly of the mechanics of dollar disbursement.     In the case of&#13;
il&#13;
)' the lire, the disbursement and the supervision come together&#13;
&#13;
     primarily for the reason that the lire are not our lire.&#13;
I&#13;
I    They are the Cassa's lire, and we are really supervising&#13;
&#13;
     disbursement of lire by the Caasa from its special account&#13;
&#13;
     and at the same time supervising the execution of the projects&#13;
&#13;
     it undertakes with those lire.&#13;
&#13;
          The Bank will take part in the selection of the projects.&#13;
&#13;
     It viII approve the loan contracts made by the Gassa with&#13;
&#13;
     its borrowers.     It will see to it that private capital in the&#13;
&#13;
     agreed proportion has been made available on the occasion&#13;
&#13;
     of disbursement.    The loans by the Cassa viII be administered&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      through commercial banks, which is a great satisfaction to&#13;
&#13;
      our treasurer's department, who feel that will give it a kind&#13;
&#13;
      of a businesslike quality which otherwise the Cassa might not&#13;
&#13;
      have been able to furnish at this particular time, because&#13;
&#13;
      the Cassa is still a young organization, and, in any case,&#13;
&#13;
      did not intend to go very far into ~81t of organizational&#13;
      details.&#13;
&#13;
           And, finally, the Bank has the right if anything goes&#13;
&#13;
     wrong to request that it see disbursement documentation&#13;
&#13;
      for the disbursal of the lire before the lire are paid to the&#13;
&#13;
     contractors and others.   That is simply a reserve power of&#13;
     the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
II        Finally, on projects, there was one little question&#13;
II&#13;
I    which I think might interest you, and that was that we ran&#13;
&#13;
     into trouble on the guarantee of completion of the projects.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank took the position in the first Â·instance that since&#13;
&#13;
     its name was associated with these projects there ought to&#13;
&#13;
     be some assurance that the projects would be completed and&#13;
&#13;
     that the projects wouldn't get half finished and then the&#13;
&#13;
     company say they couldn't put up any more capital.   We&#13;
&#13;
     tried to have the borrower and the guarantor make a commitment&#13;
     to that effect.&#13;
&#13;
          The Italian delegation took the position quite frankly&#13;
&#13;
     and eventually quite flatly that it could not commit the&#13;
&#13;
     Italian Government to guaranteeing the completion of a&#13;
&amp;#12;Ii&#13;

II           After discussion within the Bank we came to the conclu&#13;
II&#13;
i'I    sion that that was not such an unreasonable position for them&#13;
II&#13;
II to take, and we arrived at a compromise which I think is sat-&#13;
11&#13;
"      isfactory all around.&#13;
'.&#13;
n&#13;
II      The only other point that I thought I needed to mention&#13;
'I&#13;
"&#13;
:! was the preamble. It is hardly necessary to speak of it&#13;
11&#13;
:1&#13;
if&#13;
II     because you have seen it.      It does represent, I think, a&#13;
&#13;
       little departure in the sense that it indicates an intention&#13;
&#13;
11     which I am sure that on the Italian side they feel to be more&#13;
II&#13;
Ii or less of a, well, promise perhaps that we will, conditions&#13;
II&#13;
Ij     permitting, continue to take an interest in the financing&#13;
!I&#13;
fj     of this ten-year program.&#13;

i,',&#13;
i            THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you, sir.   Are there any questions?&#13;
       Beyen'?&#13;
&#13;
             i'IR. BEYEN:   Mr. Chairman, I would like first to give&#13;
&#13;
I,     expression to the great satisfaction that this loan is before&#13;
I.&#13;
H&#13;
&#13;
I us.        It is, of course, true that the Belgian loan is more or&#13;
!&#13;
       less in the same sense.     But, on the other hand, histori-&#13;
&#13;
       cally the Italian loan i3 the earliest attempt at doing some-&#13;
I thing quite different         from what we have done so far, and I am&#13;
&#13;
       quite sure that we all feel great satisfaction that the&#13;
&#13;
       solution has been found to make it possible for us to&#13;
&amp;#12;Ii                                                                  12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      participate in a very important and interesting scheme with-&#13;
&#13;
      out being hampered in tha.tby sort of misunderstood ortho-&#13;
&#13;
      doxies about what we should or shouldn't do.&#13;
&#13;
           So, my general observation is simply one of great&#13;
&#13;
      satisfaction about this.   And I would add to that that I am&#13;
&#13;
      not unduly frightened by the lack of logic which Mr.&#13;
&#13;
     Prud'Homme only -- how shall I put it? -- covered from our&#13;
&#13;
     eyes with a slight veil of shame, but I mean which appeared&#13;
r&#13;
J    through the whole thing.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't feel any apprehension either at the fact that&#13;
&#13;
     here we have a case where obviously it wouldn't have made&#13;
&#13;
     any sense for us to use our normal method of supervision&#13;
&#13;
     in connection with the dollars we provide.     ObViously, it&#13;
&#13;
     would be difficult for us to have more than a general super-&#13;
&#13;
     vision of the program, and, on the other hand, we supervise&#13;
&#13;
     certain projects which are really accessory to the whole&#13;
     scheme.&#13;
&#13;
          Well, of course, if one listens to the explanation,&#13;
&#13;
     one can't help feeling that we have said to ourselves, "Well,&#13;
&#13;
     we can t t control what we normally control.   \-le   don't want&#13;
&#13;
     to control what we normally control, so let's control.some-&#13;
&#13;
     thing else.!l   I think there is a certain danger in that,&#13;
&#13;
     because it would be nothing more than human if we ourselves&#13;
&#13;
     were to forget that the real basis of this control on. the&#13;
&#13;
     speCial projects is that we want a pretty close cooperation&#13;
&amp;#12;       with the Cassa in the general development sphere.&#13;
&#13;
           I hope it will      ~ot   mean that we will try to spend our&#13;
                       C1r,~&#13;
       "controlling" ~, which we cannot spend on 90 per cent                 x&#13;
       of the program, on the ten per cent next to the program&#13;
&#13;
      which we financed.&#13;
&#13;
           This is just a wish I express here.          I see this control&#13;
&#13;
      on the spending of the counterpart lire more as a form of&#13;
II&#13;
 II   ~operation   between the Cassa and ourselves than as a sort of&#13;
&#13;
I     supervision.     And I have sufficient confidence in the wisdom&#13;
&#13;
      of our people that they wouldn't fall into the trap where,&#13;
&#13;
      because they cannot control the sort of screws that are&#13;
&#13;
II!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ii&#13;
      used in 90 per cent of the program, they would control both&#13;
&#13;
      the screws and the screwdrivers in the other ten per cent or&#13;
'[&#13;
      however it is.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, following that general remark, 1 would like to ask&#13;
&#13;
      a few questions in this connection.        1 read the famous&#13;
&#13;
      Article IV, and I would say that if the name of our borrcwer&#13;
&#13;
      is long Article IV still beats that name in being very&#13;
&#13;
      extensive.   I have asked myself how difficult it will be to&#13;
&#13;
      translate into Italian.        That must indeed be very beautiful&#13;
&#13;
      in sound.&#13;
&#13;
           I must admit that I thought the whole thing which has&#13;
&#13;
      been accepted is rather difficult to read.          I won't go into&#13;
&#13;
      any details, but if we take Section       4.05   I assume that that&#13;
&#13;
      means that the rate at which the Bank of Italy buys dollars&#13;
&amp;#12;\1&#13;
IJ&#13;
&#13;
 I                                                                        14&#13;
 I&#13;
       from the Cas sa wi          be settled in agreement with   liS.   That&#13;
,I&#13;
  I    1s 'Nha t I deduc ted from these 20-odd lines here, and I would&#13;
&#13;
       like to know whether that is actually what it means.&#13;
 I&#13;
            MR. PRUD'HOIvn-re:::    Yes, sir.   It means, of course, the&#13;
&#13;
       official rate, and under present circumstances it is unneces-&#13;
&#13;
       sary perhaps.     There seemed a possibility, even though per-&#13;
&#13;
       haps somewhat remote, that there might be two rates at some&#13;
&#13;
       futUre date.    I believe there has been some question about&#13;
&#13;
       two rates in connection with other matters.         And that is the&#13;
&#13;
       legal phraseology or prOVision which Simply provides it will&#13;
&#13;
      be the official rate.          And it does read requiring the Bank's&#13;
      approval.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. B~YEN:      It actually means because there is no offici 1&#13;
&#13;
      rate it will be settled in accordance with us?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PRl,n I HOMME:       I t means if there should be two rates&#13;
&#13;
      in the future the Bank will have an opportunity to select&#13;
&#13;
      which rate is to be applied, whicb will be as nearly as&#13;
&#13;
      possible to make it what you would call the officlal rate.&#13;
&#13;
           1{R. CIGLIMiA-PIAZZA:         Just now we have one rate.      The&#13;
&#13;
      countervalue would be just the correspondent of that official&#13;
&#13;
      rate, which is not yet a rate with declared ,aarity .                        &gt;&#13;
           MR. BEYEN:      Of tbe two rates, what would we choose?&#13;
&#13;
      Is there any sort of guidance?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PRUD'HOI-.!M2::     No, I think there isn't.   We haven't&#13;
&#13;
      gone to tbe point wbere we anticipate a change in rate.              It is&#13;
&amp;#12; merely a security which would give us an opPortunity at the&#13;
&#13;
 time to decide what rate should be applied.&#13;
&#13;
      f~~.   BEYEN:   In any case, that is what it means?&#13;
&#13;
      MR.    PRUD'HO~~:    Yes, sir.&#13;
&#13;
      MR. BEYEN:      In 4.06(a) I would feel this would be more&#13;
&#13;
 readable if all this "right to require something" would be&#13;
&#13;
 struck out.     It just means to say that the supplementary&#13;
&#13;
projects shall be carried out with due diligence and so on.&#13;
&#13;
It seems to me the "right to require" is an awkward way to&#13;
put it.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. PRUD'HO~U~:       That 1s the outcome of a very diffi-&#13;
&#13;
cult discussion that took several meetings.       It was the&#13;
&#13;
solution to the problem of not requiring a guaran tee of&#13;
&#13;
completion either by the Cassa or by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. BEYEN:       That goes around it?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. PRUD'HOMJ.1E:     They commit themselves to establish&#13;
&#13;
certain rights vis-a-vis the companies, and then they&#13;
&#13;
promise to exercise those rights if necessary, but they do&#13;
&#13;
not guarantee the completion of the projects.&#13;
&#13;
     ~rn. BEYE~!      I see.&#13;
&#13;
     My last question, Mr. Chairman, is just about page 6 of&#13;
&#13;
the report, where this disbursement of the lira counterpart&#13;
&#13;
is mentioned.      liThe counterpart would be credi ted by the&#13;
&#13;
Bank of Italy to a special account of the Casaa at one of the&#13;
&#13;
big commercial banks, which bank would release funds against&#13;

           MR. PRUD'HOMI-.rE:      It might.   This big commercial bE.n~:,&#13;

 I   which may be a bank of na tional charac ter, which 1s the&#13;
IÂ·&#13;

d&#13;
&#13;
I     in disbursements to, letJs call them, contractors on the&#13;
&#13;
     program of the projects.          However, apart from that little&#13;
&#13;
     difficulty, which is not&#13;
&#13;
II         HR. HEYEN:         No, I agree it's no difficulty, but it&#13;
II&#13;
II brings me to what I really doubted about it:             whether this&#13;
II&#13;
     Whole documentary business made any sense at all.            Because&#13;
II&#13;
j    what actually vill happen as far as I can imagine is that&#13;
&#13;
     the Cassa will have an account with, let's say, the Sanca&#13;
&#13;
     Commerciale      Italia~~~~~ne of t~/~t::;t;~~~~ut the&#13;
     Banca Commerciale will make paymenty I           "mean- unless   you&#13;
&#13;
     exclude the banl( where you have got your account f'rom Gnter-&#13;
II&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
     ing into paymentfitself, your whole system of asking for docu&#13;
 I&#13;
II ments falls together.            Not that I want to plead for the&#13;
Ii&#13;
     system of documents, because I would be doubtful whether a&#13;
&#13;
     system of documents is necessary at all.           I mean you could&#13;
&#13;
     very well have sort of a certain supervision abou~ payment&#13;
&#13;
     without actually aSking that those payments go against&#13;
&#13;
     documents.       But it would make 30me sense if you would split&#13;
&#13;
     the thing up,          If you put the thing in the hands of one of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         17&#13;
Ii&#13;
     them and let that one operate 1n the same way as the others               ~&#13;
 I&#13;
     I mean your system of presenting documents becomes a purely&#13;
&#13;
I    administrative thing.&#13;
&#13;
:I           MR. PRUD'HOf414E:   Not   quite~   r,1r. Beyen.&#13;
'I&#13;
I,&#13;
:1           l4R. BEYEN:   Which I think it 1s.&#13;
:1&#13;
II&#13;
/I&#13;
!l           MR. PRUD'HOMME:     Not   qulte~   because the depository&#13;
!I&#13;
     bank will be acting in a dual capacity.             One, it will&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
11   hold the lire. counterpart.         And~   in a different   department~&#13;
'I&#13;
&#13;
II   it vil1 have an agreement with the Casss. as to the basis on&#13;
&#13;
     which it can make disbursements to people who have expended&#13;
&#13;
     money on the various projects.&#13;
&#13;
             Now~   the contractor coming to the bank with documents&#13;
&#13;
     evidencing that he has made certain expendltures will have&#13;
&#13;
     payment made by that bank at that moment provided that he&#13;
&#13;
     has performed in accordance with the terms of his contract.&#13;
&#13;
     That department of the bank would then go to the other&#13;
&#13;
     department of the bank and l'equest to be reimbursed for the&#13;
&#13;
     expenditures it has made.&#13;
&#13;
             It's a little bit trick7 in the case of the single&#13;
&#13;
     bank.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BEYEN:    Would the document ever be anything but&#13;
&#13;
     sort of payment ordered by the Casse?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. PRUD'HOMME:     Oh~   no.   The document w1l1 be the&#13;
&#13;
     actual receipted invoice or whatever other document the&#13;
&#13;
     contractor will present to the bank for payment.&#13;
&amp;#12;II&#13;
 I&#13;
 I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 I!          f1R. BEYSN:     Then J doesn't that mean double control&#13;
&#13;
       which makes no sense           cause e fellow     fl~st   goes to the CassQ&#13;
&#13;
       and   says~    "1 want to pay that,&#13;

&#13;
             HR. PRUD'H0M1,8:       He will not go to the Cassa in the&#13;
I&#13;
liJ.   fi rs tins tance.     The Cassa intends to make arrangemen ts&#13;
IiI,&#13;
II     with the banks and pay the banks a commission to hÂ£ndle&#13;
II&#13;
       the whole disbursement for them.             The Ca3sB will be, in&#13;
&#13;
 I     last analysis, responsible to us for seeing the proper&#13;
&#13;
       documentation has been provided or that the arrangements&#13;
&#13;
       have been properly made so the banks will receive the proper&#13;
&#13;
       documentation.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. B3YEN:      11m rather interested to understand how it&#13;
&#13;
       will wor%.       I mean if anybody wants payment he must have the&#13;
&#13;
       consent of the Cassa for payment, because Cassa pays him.&#13;
&#13;
              I1R. PRUD IHOIIlME:   He has it in a general way.                      The&#13;
&#13;
       Cassa has made an arrangement with the bank whereby the bank&#13;
&#13;
       will make disbursements on contracts which have been&#13;
&#13;
       approved by the Cassa.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BEYEN:      The Cassa approves the contracts?&#13;
&#13;
             MR.     PRUDfRO~~m:    That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BEYEN:      I see.     And on the basis of the contract&#13;
&#13;
       the bank can pay?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. PRUD'HOMME:        The bank can pay if the terms of the&#13;
&#13;
       contract have been fulfilled.&#13;
&amp;#12;            'I'lfB   CHAIRt1AN:      The Casse. is not invclved at that point.&#13;
&#13;
    The bank makes the disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
            HR. PRUD'HOMME:            That's right.&#13;
&#13;
            TH~      CHAIRM..4.N:    The bank is the agent.&#13;
&#13;
            f1R. BEYEN:        The whole sys tern of the posi tion of the one&#13;
&#13;
    bank is not clear to me.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. PRUD 'HOMPfE:          I agree that I   S   not absolutely clear.&#13;
&#13;
    It's much simpler where other banks are involved.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. BEYEN:         Especia11y if you take one of the big&#13;
&#13;
    ones.      He will have 30 per cent of the payments, and he will&#13;
&#13;
    control himself, or something like tr.a t.&#13;
I&#13;
!&#13;
            :MR. PRUD 'HOMlfJE :       Except for the arrangements that are&#13;
&#13;
    to be made between the Cassa and the banks as to what&#13;
&#13;
    expenditures the bank may make, what demands for payment the&#13;
&#13;
    bank may honor, which will be in accordance with the terms&#13;
&#13;
    of the contracts approved by the Cassa in the first instance.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. SO~~RS:                I'm not too familiar with tbis, but&#13;
&#13;
    wouldn't it be somewhat like a secured documentary credit&#13;
&#13;
    which the Cassa will open?&#13;
&#13;
         MR. BEYEN:            It's a strange thing in internal payments.&#13;
&#13;
    It's well known in external payments, but it's a strange&#13;
&#13;
    thing in internal payments.               What I was getting up against&#13;
&#13;
    in reading this was:              Aren't we impOSing a method which is&#13;
&#13;
    quite in its place in external payments, but on internal&#13;
&#13;
    payments a mechanism that is never used at all?&#13;
&amp;#12;Iâ&#128;¢&#13;
 I&#13;
 I&#13;
                                                                          2C&#13;
1\&#13;
II        I mean my remark is not jus t as futi Ie as it          ID8.y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I    sound.      That is what I feared when I read this.      Because&#13;
11&#13;
     the sort of documentary credit which is offered against&#13;
I!&#13;
     documents where the bank gets an instruction to         pay is       very&#13;
I&#13;
IÂ·   well known, of course, and very suitable to external credits.&#13;
 I               CHAIRMAN:     -rie do it here in this country.&#13;
&#13;
          ~1R.   GARNER:     It's a usual thing here.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. BEYEN:       \&gt;je 11, yes, but it's a fairly unusual thing&#13;
&#13;
     in European banking.        And although I am full of admira tion&#13;
&#13;
     for American banking, I don't think it's exactly our task to&#13;
&#13;
     impose methods that are foreign to them on them in this&#13;
&#13;
     particular case.        And that is a little bit what I am afraid&#13;
&#13;
     wi 11 happen.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. PRUD'HONME:        In answer to that, Hr. Beyen, I&#13;
&#13;
     should have said that the Cassa representatives themselves&#13;
&#13;
     seem quite pleased with this.        They said they had no in-&#13;
&#13;
     tention of handling documents themselves.          They couldn't&#13;
&#13;
     afford to.      And they even spoke of the rate of cOmmUssion&#13;
&#13;
     they would pay the bank.&#13;
&#13;
          J.m.   BEYEN:    That made them so pleased wi th it I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
     I can well understand that.        Any bank would think it's&#13;
&#13;
     wonderful if they got a commission for doing that.&#13;
&#13;
          All right.       I mean I know that it's all been settled and&#13;
&#13;
     accepted.     But it struck me as trying to impose a method of&#13;
&#13;
     financing which is, well, actually I would almost say obsolet&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
      in 3uropean banking except --&#13;
&#13;
             MR. MELVILLE:   May I ask I'4r. Beyen what objections he&#13;
&#13;
      sees to this method of procedure?      I'm not clear about that.&#13;
&#13;
     It's different perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BEYEN:   I have no objections.   I have no objection&#13;
&#13;
     to this.     At any rate, it's settled, and the people have&#13;
&#13;
     accepted it.     I have only a sort of general fear that we&#13;
&#13;
     shouldn't try to get people out of their normal banking&#13;
&#13;
     practices unless there is very good reason to do so.&#13;
&#13;
             HR. MELVILLE:   Often, of course .. th08e normal banking&#13;
&#13;
     practices develop as a result of competition between banks&#13;
&#13;
     in a country to give service to their customers, when they&#13;
&#13;
     in fact themselves would be very pleased to go about it in a&#13;
&#13;
     more detailed way.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BEYEN:   Yes.&#13;
I&#13;
1\&#13;
                                 I am not so sure this is a develop-&#13;
&#13;
     ment.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SELEK:   Was it imposed in this case by us .. or was&#13;
&#13;
     it the result of the procedure?      I think if the Casss&#13;
&#13;
     didn't want to handle itself all the documents, somebody on&#13;
&#13;
     its behalf has to do the checking.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. CIGLIM~A-PIAZZA:      That's exactly it.   And I wanted&#13;
&#13;
     to say this to Mr. Beyen:      I would say that the Cassa&#13;
&#13;
     welcomed practically this appointment of a fiscal agent, let's&#13;
&#13;
     say, to handle business for which they had chosen not to get&#13;
&#13;
     themselves overburdened with personnel which would be used&#13;
&amp;#12;II&#13;
II                                                                           22&#13;
II&#13;
I:p&#13;
Ii    instead in a much more efficient way if they kept more of a&#13;
Ii&#13;
II    skeleton staff that really goes after the business of&#13;
Ii    d9velopment that the CassEl 'b..as in mind instead of spreading&#13;
Ii&#13;
      too much on the administrative business.&#13;
Ii&#13;
I!&#13;
'I&#13;
            HR. BEYEN:       Well, all right.     It's all right witb   m6&#13;
Ii&#13;
Ii    as long as they are happy about it.&#13;
:i&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
            THE   CHAIRMA..1'i:    Any other questions?&#13;
11&#13;
           MR. WOLFSON:           I would like to ask a question, Mr.&#13;
II&#13;
Ii    Chairman, not in questioning the loan but rather seeking&#13;
Ii&#13;
      clarification in my own mind.          Do I understand correctly&#13;
Ii&#13;
I!    tha t the purpose of this loan is rather to facilitate what&#13;
II&#13;
      might become an aggravated balance of payments position&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
'&#13;
I,\&#13;
r!&#13;
      and that all that we are seeking to do is to make certain&#13;
II&#13;
      that the adverse pressure on the balance of payments will&#13;
Ii&#13;
II&#13;
\'&#13;
,I&#13;
      emanate from real development and not from merely an&#13;
&#13;
II    expanded consumption that might result from something else?&#13;
&#13;
II,&#13;
      Because, the description such as I heard; even to the point&#13;
&#13;
~     of not undertaking responsibility for the completion of the&#13;
&#13;
      projects, seemed to indicate to me that in point of fact&#13;
I&#13;
      that is what we are doing:          that Italy, desirous of under-&#13;
&#13;
      taking certain deVelopment., antiCipating there may be an&#13;
&#13;
      aggravation in its balance of payments, wants from us a&#13;
&#13;
      foreign exchange loan.          He have said, "Yes, we think that&#13;
&#13;
      th..at is a good thing to do.        It w..ay be that the foreign ex-&#13;
&#13;
      change doesn't result from this particular set of proj~at~P~~&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                   'I&#13;
                                                                                    !&#13;
Ii&#13;
                                                                              23&#13;
II&#13;
     but in doing it we want to make sure you're really getting&#13;
Ii&#13;
     down to development tasks and the. t your aggre.va ted posi tion&#13;
f&#13;
I    doesn't merely come to an increa.sed consur:1ption picture.              II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II        Is that more or less in very crude analJ,sis the whole&#13;
&#13;
 I   basis of this loan?&#13;
&#13;
          MR. PRUD'HOivilfJ.3:      Yes, sir, except that I think I would&#13;
&#13;
     put the plan or the program first in your statement.&#13;
&#13;
     Having decided on this rather large            program~      it became&#13;
&#13;
     evident that it is of such a scope that there will be a&#13;
&#13;
     foreign exchan           1 mpac t of a materia 1 amoun t .&#13;
&#13;
          fJlR. 1-[Ol.PSON:     Only insofar as it may reflect itself in&#13;
&#13;
     increased consumption.           Because, as I understand, as far as&#13;
&#13;
     the program itself is concerned there is no direct or even a&#13;
&#13;
     prOXimate, indirect impact on a foreign exchange position.&#13;
&#13;
          MR.   PRUDtHO~lli:       Except in the sense that there will&#13;
&#13;
     be 200,000 to 300,000 more people employed, it is estimated,&#13;
&#13;
     and their needs will in part be translated into consumption&#13;
&#13;
     of imported goods.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. WOLFSON:          Exactly what I meant -- that all we are&#13;
&#13;
     doing really is anticipating an aggravated balance of pay-&#13;
&#13;
     ments position because 200,000 or 300,000 people will be&#13;
&#13;
     consuming more     tr~n     they would be consuming when they are&#13;
&#13;
     lesser employed.&#13;
&#13;
         MR. PRUD'HOm1E:           That's corractj yes, sir.&#13;
&#13;
          MR. \'[OLFSOH:        Right.   So long as it I s clear.1n our minds&#13;
&amp;#12;Ii&#13;
1:&#13;
IiI&#13;
I,                                                                                          24&#13;
Ii&#13;
.,&#13;
II&#13;
IÂ·&#13;
       that that is the type of loan we are undertaking~ I, of&#13;
:1&#13;
      course, have nothing to say in this.                          But I wanted to be&#13;
II&#13;
II&#13;
Ii&#13;
      sure that that is really the t                      ng we are doing.&#13;
II&#13;
            THE CHPJRJWI :             That! s right.&#13;
II&#13;
               SIR '2RN~ST ROWE-Dti"rI"TON:           I'lr. Chairman J      jus t two \fords.&#13;
l.&#13;
      A very hearty welcome indeed for the loan and                           satis~action&#13;
 I&#13;
      tha t a1 though it has te.ken a long ticne it has been 'Iiell&#13;
&#13;
      worth taki        that time to get thinss in shape which satis-&#13;

&#13;
            Now, just appended to whe.t                  1,18   have heard from H.r.&#13;
&#13;
      Holfson, it is very important indeed that the Bank of I&#13;

&#13;
      don't, the whole thing will be inflationary and the essential&#13;
I&#13;
It    purpose of our loan entirely frustrated.                           We can't oversee&#13;
      that in any way at all.                But I do say to r::I'J Ita lian&#13;
&#13;
      colleague that for once spending dollars is a very important&#13;
&#13;
      thing.&#13;
&#13;
           rÂ·m.   WOLFSON:      And a proper type of spending.&#13;
&#13;
           SIR ERNEST ROWE-DUT'rOH:                  Yes, sir.&#13;
&#13;
           THE CHAIRMAN:           Any other ques tions?&#13;
&#13;
           (N 0 response.)&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you very much, Mr. Prud'Homme.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Rembert.&#13;
&#13;
           t1R. REMBERT:       The projects which have been agreed with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               ,,-&#13;
 the Cassa as a basis for lira financing are list                   on page    &lt;:)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 of the    Pr9s~d9nt's    report.     This     st contains a        tal of&#13;
&#13;
          jects) ~ine of which are directly related to agri-&#13;
&#13;
 culture and in this respect tie definitely into the Cassa's&#13;
&#13;
 general agricultural program.&#13;
&#13;
         The engineering work on these projects is we               ad-&#13;
&#13;
 vane     , and most of them are now ready for execution.                 We&#13;
&#13;
 thin:rc they are all technically sound.          They have been engi-&#13;
&#13;
nee       according to good practice, and all of               r    fea tures&#13;
seem to be well organized.&#13;
&#13;
        The total cost of this list, the estimated cost, is&#13;
&#13;
about 15"       )000,000 lire, which is equivalent to about&#13;
&#13;
$24,000,1)00.    Out of that amount, about $300,000 are required&#13;
&#13;
for imported equipment along with small amounts of Swedish&#13;
&#13;
kroner and German marks.           So the import requirements are&#13;
&#13;
re    tively small in comparison -- or very small"                  fact&#13;
with the total cost of the projects.&#13;
&#13;
        They all seem to be sound business ventures.               Operating&#13;
&#13;
at a reasonable capacity" they will all cover finanCial&#13;
&#13;
charges as antiCipated at the present time and Will, in&#13;
&#13;
addition, show reasonable profits, the exception to that&#13;
&#13;
last statement being the fruit and vegetable collection&#13;
&#13;
centers which will be operated on a no-profit oasis.&#13;
&#13;
        The companies involved are, with one exception~ old,&#13;
well established&#13;
                         rIDS   in Italy.    They vary in size from&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           He feel as a result of our contacts in Italy that the&#13;
&#13;
     3ank ' s participation with these projects is instrumental&#13;
&#13;
     in getting a very substantial amount of private capital&#13;
&#13;
     interested and flowing into Southern Italy.               Our participa-&#13;
&#13;
     tion at this time is going to mean a definite acceleration&#13;
&#13;
     of the indus trial deve'lopmen t of South Italy, which Ina:y:&#13;

     '.-li th its own impetus, Ie. tar carry on.&#13;
 I&#13;
~         Now, those are the highlights as a group.               I won't&#13;

          'THE CHAIRMAN:             Thanks.&#13;

          Any questions?&#13;

          Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
          Hr. Stevenson.&#13;
&#13;
          14R. STEVENSON:            Both the development program for the&#13;
&#13;
     South and the nature of the Bank's participation in it have&#13;
&#13;
     been discussed in considerable detail here on a previous&#13;
&#13;
     occasion~   namely, at the time the letter was sent to the&#13;
&#13;
     Governor of the Bank of Italy just over a year ago.               And,&#13;
&#13;
     furthermore, as the Loan Director has already mentioned, some&#13;
&#13;
     of the most interesting features of the loan were&#13;
&#13;
     incorporated in the loan to Belgium approved a few weeks ago.&#13;
&amp;#12; I:&#13;
 Ii&#13;
 I'                                                                 28&#13;
 ji&#13;
      has~   in fact, obtained some gold payments is already an&#13;
&#13;
      encouraging: sign.&#13;
&#13;
             Nevertheless, one should not lose sight of the fae t tha     1&#13;
      Italy's international economic position is more vulnerable           I&#13;
      than that of many other countries because she importsÂ·&#13;
&#13;
      relatively essential products and exports less essential&#13;
&#13;
      goods and services, of which tourism is     ~ot   the least&#13;
&#13;
      important.&#13;
&#13;
             However, if a gradual rise in world production and&#13;
&#13;
      trade continues and if there is no protracted world economic&#13;
&#13;
      depreSSion, this shOUld not give rise to insoluble problems.&#13;
&#13;
      But, nevertheless, it is an added   rls~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II           The major risk involved in the dollar loan to Italv ari1es&#13;
I!                                                                  v      I&#13;
      from the fact that Italy's major mar:.cets are in Europe,&#13;
&#13;
      whereas she has in recent years been particularly heavily&#13;
&#13;
      dependent on imports from the Western Hemisphere.        Although&#13;
&#13;
      overall eauilibrium was achieved last year, there was still&#13;
&#13;
      a deficit of some 200 million with the dollar area.&#13;
&#13;
              Since the speedy resumption of convertibility can&#13;
&#13;
      hardly be safely assumed, Italy's dollar balance thus assume&#13;
&#13;
      a   c~~clal   importance.&#13;
&#13;
              Exports to the dollar area may be safely assumed to&#13;
&#13;
      rise.     It would not, however, be reasonable to count too&#13;
&#13;
      ,heavily on this factor for two reasons:     Firs t, becaus e even&#13;
&#13;
      a large percentage increase would bring only a relatively&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            29&#13;
&#13;
small reduction in the deficit; and also because the out-&#13;
&#13;
look for some traditicnal Italian s?ecialties in the&#13;
&#13;
American marke t is ra ther uncertain"   The eXlJendi tUres of AIn r-&#13;
&#13;
ican tourists may also     expected to add to ItalY'3 dollar&#13;
&#13;
earnings somewhat, and dcllar ?ayrnents for shipning should&#13;
&#13;
go on decreasing as they have been over the past two or&#13;
&#13;
three years.&#13;
&#13;
     But the greatest contribution to the reduction of the&#13;
&#13;
dollar deficit will have to come from smaller dollar imports&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, that has been the case in the last two years in&#13;
&#13;
which time the deficit has been halved mainly by a fall in&#13;
&#13;
dollar imports.   Among these imports, foodstuffs, fuels,&#13;
&#13;
ra.w materials and maChinery at present bulk large.&#13;
&#13;
     Despi te this setback represented by the resumption of&#13;
&#13;
coal shipments to Italy this year fr"om the United States,&#13;
&#13;
Italy's dollar imports are by no means incompressible.       The&#13;
&#13;
volume of machinery imported under the ERP program in&#13;
&#13;
recent years is clearly abnormally high, while dollar'&#13;
&#13;
imports of products such as wheat and cotton have already&#13;
&#13;
declined very considerably from their postwar peaks.&#13;
&#13;
     Further economic development in other areas, including&#13;
&#13;
development financed by Bank loans, should continue to&#13;
&#13;
reduce Italy's and indeed Europe's dependence on Western&#13;
&#13;
Hemisphere supplies.&#13;
&#13;
     And, finally, such further inflows of dollar capital&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        30&#13;

&#13;
     able to hope that in the course of the next few years the&#13;
&#13;
     Italian dollar deficit will be reduced at least to a level&#13;
&#13;
     sufficiently low th..a t if the rna jar European cun-eneies then&#13;
&#13;

     arise will be soluble within the framework of a viab&#13;
&#13;
     system of interna.tional payments and at a level of payments&#13;
&#13;
     which will permit service of an external debt at least of th&#13;
&#13;
     present order of magnitude.&#13;

          THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
          Any questions?&#13;
&#13;
          (No response.)&#13;
&#13;
          Thank"you very much.&#13;

&#13;
     there are a few very minor changes in the form of agreement&#13;
&#13;
     that will be signed from the form that was circulated to&#13;
&#13;
     the Directors?     They were either typographical errors or&#13;
&#13;
     changes in translating, such as changing "f'.iinister of the&#13;
&#13;
     Treasury" to "Minis tel" for the Treasury. II     Only one thing&#13;
&#13;
     that doesn't fall in that category is the deletion of&#13;
&#13;
     Section 8.04 of the Loan Agreement, which merely provided fo&#13;
&#13;
     the designation of the Italian representatives who would&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 31&#13;
&#13;
withdraw from the loan account and do similar financial&#13;
&#13;
operations.      They will be designated by a separate paper.&#13;
&#13;
     THS CHAIEM.1Ur:         Any further discussion?&#13;
&#13;
     If not, I would like to hear a motion to approve the&#13;
&#13;
resolution.&#13;
&#13;
     (Thereupon, motion for approval of the resolution was&#13;
&#13;
duly made by P-1r. Beyen and duly seconded by Hr. Selek.)&#13;

&#13;
     filR. CIGLIANA-PIAZZA:          Mr. President, I wish to express&#13;
&#13;
the full appreciation of my Government and my personal one&#13;
&#13;
for the thorough study and painstaking attention given&#13;
&#13;
by the management and the staff to this project.            Both in&#13;
&#13;
the missions to I taly and in the negotiations in Washington,&#13;
&#13;
the officials of the Research, Loan and Legal Departments&#13;
&#13;
have contributed to the conclusion of this loan with full&#13;
&#13;
understanding and good will, safeguarding the interests of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and, at the same time, fully realizing the economic&#13;
&#13;
and social benefits that the ten-year plan would attain&#13;
&#13;
for the development of Southern Italy.           This concludes a&#13;
&#13;
long period of studies, surveys and negotiations which&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              32&#13;
&#13;
    started nearly two years ago with the imaginative approach&#13;
&#13;
    by the Bank to this particular problem.   I   wish to express&#13;
&#13;
    my thanks again, therefore, to the management and the staff.&#13;
&#13;
         THE CHAIRMAN:    Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
         r want to apologize because, due to a combination of&#13;
    circumstances, we expect to sign the loan agreement immed-&#13;
&#13;
    iately after this meeting, and so when the meeting is&#13;
&#13;
    adjourned if you would all leave the room as promptly as&#13;
&#13;
    possible we can arrange the room, and then I would like to&#13;
&#13;
    invite all of you to come back and watch the signing.    We&#13;
&#13;
    are going to follow our usual custom and serve sherry.     If&#13;
&#13;
    you would all come back, I would be very glad to have you&#13;
&#13;
    attend the signing.&#13;
&#13;
         There is a meeting tomorrow morning at half past nine&#13;
&#13;
I   to discuss the Yugoslav loan.&#13;
&#13;
        The meeting is adjourned.&#13;
&#13;
         (Thereupon, at 5:25 p.m., the meeting was adjourned.)&#13;
