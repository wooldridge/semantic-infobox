over 30 years and now firmly in the hands of local enterprises, farmers and household water users.&#13;

This field note traces the&#13;
development of wells and water-&#13;
lifting technology in the water&#13;
scarce country of Niger. It describes&#13;
a range of hand-augering and&#13;
water-lifting techniques that have&#13;
been introduced over the past 30&#13;
years, primarily in southern Niger. It&#13;
traces the role of non-government&#13;
organizations in terms of pioneering&#13;
the technology and supporting the&#13;
growth of a locally based business&#13;
environment to increase access&#13;
to the relevant technologies. The&#13;
research points to the necessity for&#13;
investment in the early stages ­ to&#13;
develop and test the technologies&#13;
within specific localities, build the&#13;
skills of independent drillers and&#13;

Manufacturers and Hand&#13;
Drillers: Variations on a&#13;
Theme&#13;
&#13;
The background of the nine&#13;
manufacturers interviewed for the study&#13;
varies considerably. Mahaman Sani&#13;
Rabo finished the Lycée (secondary&#13;
school) with a specialization in metalwork&#13;
construction while neither Maman Dan&#13;
Chitou nor Souradji Hassan attended&#13;
school. Souradji started work as a&#13;
welder, eventually buying his employer's&#13;
equipment. Adamou Fall and Maiga                       Mintu Garba (right) and fellow women market gardeners at their plots in Karra&#13;
Shafagan had a history of work with LWR&#13;
from the 1980s. Ango Koumandawa,                       Box 5. Multiple uses of water in Karra&#13;
&#13;
Mounkaila Oumarou, and Aboubakar                        Mintu Garba is the chairwoman of a women's group of vegetable gardeners in&#13;
Salifou honed their metalwork skills in                 Karra, near Birni. Their gardens provide an oasis of green throughout the year&#13;
development projects9 which upgraded                    against the backdrop of a very dry landscape for much of the year. Onions,&#13;
the skills of traditional blacksmiths, giving           lettuce, papayas and squash are among the produce that the women grow&#13;
birth to some of the first highly skilled               for home consumption as well for sale. Mintu told me that she has tended her&#13;
metal workers in Niger, and contributing                garden for 30 years. Vegetable gardening was traditionally an activity reserved&#13;
much to the skills pool of today's treadle              for old women, but more and more women in the area now have gardens.&#13;
pump industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Common to the treadle pump                              The gardens are littered with hand-drilled wells installed with treadle pumps,&#13;
&#13;
manufacturers is their diversity of                     which the women use to irrigate their plots. The owners of these facilities prefer&#13;
&#13;
production including metal beds, doors,                 to drink this water than that of the cement-lined, open well nearby, as it is&#13;
&#13;
ploughs, trailers and wire fencing. Some                clearer. Mintu and her fellow women provide one example of people using hand-&#13;
&#13;
have auger equipment of their own, plus                 drilled wells and irrigation pumps for both productive and domestic water.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    create confidence in the company&#13;
    and product.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although the artisans interviewed&#13;
spoke of how well they had done&#13;
with their treadle pump sales, they&#13;
complained that they lacked sufficient&#13;
money to reinvest in their businesses.&#13;
Ibrahim Mamadou of EWV believes&#13;
lack of reinvestment has more to do&#13;
with setting priorities: "People often&#13;
prefer to invest in cows than in their&#13;
manufacturing business." He says&#13;
maintenance is given a low priority,&#13;
with a tendency to "wait until things&#13;
completely fall apart." Poor business&#13;
management may be a constraint to&#13;
their development.&#13;

The hand drillers interviewed were         Ango Koumandawa at his workship in Tibiri&#13;

In the early days of PPIP I, EWV placed    price-based competition, brought in          mechanisms, there are no serious&#13;

for subsidies. They are said to push&#13;
the prices of drilled wells down to&#13;
unrealistic levels. Mounkaila Oumarou,&#13;
a driller and pump manufacturer in Birni&#13;
N'gaoure says, "US$ 30 to US$ 40 for&#13;
a well is too little...the danger is that&#13;
poor workmanship undertaken for that&#13;
price will ruin the market for everyone."&#13;
Ango Koumandawa, in Tibiri, has a set&#13;
price below which he will not drill. As a&#13;
result he has not drilled for a year. Both&#13;
price-based competition and the role of&#13;
agents were under discussion by PIP II&#13;
in November 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Risks: Water Quality&#13;
and Water Resources&#13;
&#13;
There are large numbers of traditional&#13;
wells tapping shallow groundwater&#13;
throughout the country. The water            Cutting well screen on site&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
significant quantities of water, but&#13;
this does not address the issue of&#13;
water quality. On the other hand,&#13;
a spokesperson from the Local&#13;
Government Hydraulic Department&#13;
comments that "[Government] asks&#13;
people not to drink the garden water by&#13;
providing them with deep wells." Clearly,&#13;
there are contradictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another concern is the overuse of&#13;
groundwater. Thousands of hand-&#13;
augered wells are being used for&#13;
irrigation. Although the Tarka Valley is&#13;
recharged by annual rains, the sheer&#13;
number of people practising small-scale&#13;
irrigation has raised concerns, and&#13;
some parts of the area, such as Tesaou,&#13;
have already experienced falling water&#13;
tables. Fortunately, the suction capacity&#13;
of the pumps being used is self limiting.&#13;
The Government, PIP II and UNDP are&#13;
all monitoring water levels. Considerable&#13;
research and reliable data is required to&#13;
analyze the risks associated with water&#13;
quality and water resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
Research findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This brief survey has shown that&#13;
hand-augered wells fitted with very&#13;
low-cost water-lifting devices are a&#13;
viable water source for both domestic&#13;
and agricultural water supply in parts of&#13;
Niger. Despite their poverty, thousands&#13;
of households have been willing and&#13;
able to pay for the construction of these&#13;
wells and simple lifting devices for their&#13;
fields and homes.                           Yahaya Abdu (Balleyara) demonstrates drinking from his `irrigation' well&#13;

Way forward and&#13;
recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reflection on Niger's history of hand-&#13;
augered wells illustrates that once&#13;
sufficiently proven, the skills of drillers&#13;
and pump manufacturers should be built&#13;
up to catalyze the process of market&#13;
development. To develop markets, it&#13;
has been important to be able to offer a&#13;
choice of hand-dug wells, hand-drilled&#13;
wells, and a range of lifting devices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is considerable potential for hand-&#13;
drilling technologies that can penetrate&#13;
harder formations and drill to greater&#13;
depths, and for corresponding water-&#13;
lifting technologies. Hand percussion&#13;
drilling and rope pumps could provide&#13;
water to numerous small communities in&#13;
Niger, which are currently not included in&#13;
Government plans. These technologies&#13;
could also benefit other countries in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa.                               Fetching water from a cement-walled well&#13;

            Niger : only the beginning

        <abstracts>
            This field note traces the development
            of wells and water lifting technology in the water scarce
            country of Niger. It describes a range of hand-augering and
            water-lifting techniques that have been introduced over the
            past 30 years, primarily in southern Niger. It traces the
            role of non-government organizations in terms of pioneering
            the technology and supporting the growth of a locally based
            business environment to increase access to the relevant
            technologies. The research points to the necessity for
            investment in the early stages to develop and test the
            technologies within specific localities, build the skills of
            independent drillers and pump manufacturers, and careful
            support to private sector market development.
