"OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT CHANGES IN A "TRADE SENSITIVE" SECTOR:&#13;
ADJUSTMENT IN THE U.S. FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY"&#13;
This work in progress report is part of an inquiry being undertaken&#13;
by the World Bank in conjunction with scholars from twelve industrial&#13;
countries into the penetration of the markets of industrial countries&#13;
by exports of manufactures from developing countries. The project seeks&#13;
to establish the shares of industrial country markets held by the&#13;
developing countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they&#13;
vary among industry groups and countries. The aim is to assist developing&#13;
and industrial countries to improve their policies through a better&#13;
understanding of trade patterns and protectionist pressures.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to simulate output and employment&#13;
changes that occur in the United States footwear industry over the&#13;
next decade under various economic and commercial policy scenarios.&#13;
The nonrubber footwear industry is portrayed as a "senile" industry&#13;
with declining output and employment, a simple labor-intensive techno-&#13;
logy, and aging plant and equipment. Using a dynamic, simultaneous&#13;
equation model of industry adjustment which includes the interaction of&#13;
foreign variables, the simulations indicate that even with government&#13;
intervention and favorable economic growth in the United States, industry&#13;
output and employment face a long term decline. Footwear production&#13;
appears to be going through a difficult transition of migration to certain&#13;
developing countries.&#13;

OUTPUT AND  MPLOYMNT CHANGES IN A "TRADE SENSITIVE" SECTOR:&#13;
ADJUSTMENT IN THE U.S. FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY&#13;
I. 'Introduction&#13;
"The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) today&#13;
reported to President Carter that the domestic'footwear industry is being&#13;
seriously injured by imports and recommended that tariff rate quotas be&#13;
imposed to relieve the injury. The injury determination was unanimous&#13;
and relief would last for 5 years allowing the existing quotas of shoes&#13;
to enter at present duties (6-15%) and "overquota" imports to enter at&#13;
a 40% tariff rate." 1&#13;
Such proclamations from official trade bodies seem to have&#13;
become a growing part of international commerce in' recent years The&#13;
shoe industry in the United States is a particularly interesting case,&#13;
as it is a perennial recipient of import competition and government assis-&#13;
tance. It is a classic' example of a"senile" industry with declining&#13;
output and employment, aging plants, and an unsophisticated labor intensive&#13;
technology, remaining in limbo for over a decade because of various govern-&#13;
ment measures designed to offset the effect of foreign competition.&#13;
In this paper we propose first to present an overview of the U.S.&#13;
nonrubber footwear industry and document changes in import penetration&#13;
that have occurred in the last decade, and second, to develop a model to&#13;
simulate the output and employment effects on the U.S. nonrubber footwear&#13;
industry of cnianging economic conditions in the rest of the world.&#13;

II.  Structure of the U.S. Footwear Industry&#13;
The U.S. nonrubber footwear industry (SIC:314) is made up of&#13;
approximaitely 350 firms producing shoes in approximately 700 plants,&#13;
regionilly concentrated in the New England (North East) part of the&#13;
United States.3  Entry and exit from the industry at,the,manufacturing&#13;
stage approximates the conditions-of 'perfect competitio.. w.l . AM - fify&#13;
as one,quarter of the industry firms withdrawing from-and commencing pro-&#13;
duction in any one year. It has many small firms. exit and entry are&#13;
easy, owner management dominates, technology is constant or slowly&#13;
advancing, economics of scale are negligible over a large range of output,&#13;
and price leadership is absent.4&#13;
Despite the trava.ils of the industry, the number of firms involved&#13;
in footwear manufacturing has only declined by-about 100-(2.8 percent per&#13;
year) since 1967.5   Footwear production has decreased by 3.3 percent&#13;
annually since 1967 in quantity terms and by 2.8 percent annually in real&#13;
value terms, dipping to a 40 year low in 1978 (Table-1). -Employment has&#13;
declined at about the same rate.   (See Bale and Muttitor details,of shoe&#13;
worker displacements.) Figure 1 demonstrates that the decrease in pro-&#13;
duction has been largely confined to-women's and children's shoes. Imports&#13;
have filled the gap, capturing an increasing share-of the market each year.&#13;
Imports of shoes have grown at an. annual rate of,over 9 percent (volue&#13;
basis) and at an annual rate of 13.5 percent in terms of-value, now captur-&#13;
ing a full 50 petcent of the market, up from 18 percent in 1967. In addition&#13;
to Table 1, this dramatic increase is shown in Figure 2 where the dominant&#13;
effect of women's shoe imports can be seen.&#13;

Principal foreign suppliers to the U.S. market (1977) are Taiwan&#13;
(125 million pairs) and Korea (43 million pairs) exporting mainly with vinyl&#13;
shoes, and Italy (32 million pairs), Spain (24 million pairs), and Brazil&#13;
(13 million pairs) mainly with leather shoes&#13;
In late 1977 Orderly Marketing Agreements were negotiated with&#13;
Taiwan and Korea to restrict their nonrubber footwear exports to the United States&#13;
through 1981. Since signing the agreement, imports from these countries have halvec&#13;

whlUe imports from Hong Kong and the Philippines have increased by 250&#13;
and 1250 percent respectively. This inc-rease is attributed to footwear&#13;
parts cut and partially assembled in Korea and Taiwan, shipped to one of&#13;
the above countries for finishing, and then shipped to the United States&#13;
Subsequently (November 1978) the United States has negotiated a licensing&#13;
system with Hong Kong where "certificates of or.gin" are issued for footwear&#13;
made from Hong Kong components. All noncertificated-footwear from Hong Kong&#13;

is excluded from entry. Korea and Taiwan countered their restricted&#13;
access to the U.S. market by upgrading the quality of their quota and by&#13;
exporting "lasted uppers" - shoes without soles which are not subject to&#13;
the OMA and are outside the 814 tariff classification. The United States&#13;
has since neutralized this by including lasted uppers within the OMA.&#13;
A recent development in the U.S. footwear industry, not apparent&#13;
from the data, is the role of certain rubber footwear on the nonrubber&#13;
footwear sector. Many types of rubber footwear such as waterproof overshoes&#13;
and rubber boots are not normally considered close substitutes for nonrub-&#13;
ber footwear. But sneakers (i.e. rubber soled/fabric upper shoes) are&#13;
close substitutes. A recent fashion trend in the United States has been&#13;
the widespread acceptance of sneakers for everyday casual use especially&#13;
among children and young adults. Sales and imports of sneakers have&#13;
increased dramatically in recent years and must have had a sizeable impact&#13;
on the nonrubber footwear industry, even though most attention has been&#13;
paid to nonrubber footwear imports. Domestic sneaker production increased&#13;
from 81 to 87 million pairs from 1977 to 1978 while imports jumped from&#13;
100 million pairs to 207 million pairs. This is a one year increase in&#13;
import penetration from 55 percent to 70 percent. The major sources of&#13;
imports of sneakers are Taiwan and the Republic of Korea -- the two&#13;
nations where the United States negotiated OMA's on nonrubber footwear in&#13;
1977. The rapidity with which these countries respond to a changing trade&#13;
envirorment is simply amazing. Of total footwear exports from Korea in&#13;
1977 70 percent were nonrubber and 30 percent were rubber footwear. In&#13;
1978 these percentages were reversed6&#13;
The decline in the nonrubber footwear industry in the United&#13;
States over the last decade is not unique to the U.S. Virtually all&#13;
industralized countries (with the obvious exceptions of Italy and Spain)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are experiencing reductions in domestic shoe production while imports,&#13;
mainly from developing countries, increase. Table 2 shows the increasing&#13;

The saga of market forces searching for alternative ways to Lain mar-&#13;
ket access thus continues while government officials, reinforced by the industry,&#13;
fight a rearguard action of plugging leaks in the protective structure. This&#13;
is but one chapter in a continuing drama which is repeated daily with different&#13;
players and different products throughout the world.&#13;
The next section of the paper develops a model which simulates the&#13;
output and employment effects of changing economic conditions in the rest of&#13;
the world under alternative trade cegimes on the U.S. nonrubber footwear industry.&#13;
The model has several features. First, it is dynamic in that the output from one&#13;
year is fed into the following year. A dynamic framework is desirable to&#13;
trace the annual impact of changing growth rates, productivity, and the stag-&#13;
ing of tariffs over an extended period. Second, foreign influences such as&#13;
productivity growth and other economic variables are incorporated in four&#13;
simultaneous equations.&#13;
Finally, simulations are extended over a ten year period in the&#13;
absence of restrictions on footwear imports and in the presence of the&#13;
proposed ITC tariff-quota.7&#13;
III. An Analytical Model of Industry Output Determination&#13;
The structural model presented here to deal with the interaction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
of foreign and domestic factors is based on supply and demand responses in&#13;
the markets for imports and domestic competing goods. The product is treated&#13;
as if the United States does not export it! Consequently, demand&#13;
for U.S. output depends merely on domestic sales. Since the supply of imports&#13;
to the United States is the residual of foreign supply less foreign demand,&#13;
foreign income enters this equation, as well as output prices, input prices&#13;
and a productivity factor. Equations 1 to 4 represent the model.&#13;
ln Md = a0+ al nY/Pr + a2ln E(l+t)Pm/Pr + a3lnP/Pr ....... (1)&#13;
ln Dd   8 00+ 81lnY/Pr + a2ln E(l+t)Pm/Pr + 8 3lnPIPr .......(2)&#13;
lnMs - y     y+ T + y2lnPm + y3lnPm + y4lnYf'&#13;
in D  - 5 + 61T + Si2laP + S 31np*&#13;
Where, Md and Ma are quantities. of imports elmanded and supplied, respectively,&#13;
Dd and Ds are quantities of the domestic good demanded and supplied, respec-&#13;
tively, Y is money income, Pm is the foreign currency price of imports, E is&#13;
the exchange rate, t is the tariff rate, P is the dollar price of the domestic&#13;
good, Pr is an index of all other final good prices, T is time, Pm is a&#13;
composite input price for foreign goods' production, Yf is real foreign&#13;
income, and P is a composite input price for domestic goods' production.&#13;
The approximation of constant elasticities is imposed.&#13;
If the footwear industry accounts for a small share of total output,&#13;
then income, the price index of other final goods, the exchange rate, and all&#13;
input price indices can be regarded as exogenously determined.9&#13;
Output prices are determined endogenously, so that when we calculate&#13;
equilibriwa values where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
we can derive the four endogenous variables as functions of the seven&#13;
exogenous variables in familiar reduced form expressions. We express all&#13;
variables in terms of rates of change. This framiewiork illustrates explic-&#13;
itly the structural features of the economy implicit in other research.&#13;
In matrix form the equation set can be written as:&#13;

Because the model is based on relationships which hold in equilibrium, it&#13;
is well suited for capturing underlying trends which determine longer-run&#13;
results.&#13;
IV. Structural Estimates of the Model&#13;
Implementing the model requires parameter estimates of the supply&#13;
and demand coefficients in equations 1 to 4, and projections of values for&#13;
the exogenous variables into the future. In this section we describe the&#13;
derivation of parameter estimates.&#13;
The import demand equaticn is estimated over 1958-72 to&#13;
minimize the difficulty of collecting comparable data from foreign and&#13;
domestic sources, especially with respect to foreign price and input cost&#13;
data (unavailable for footwear before 195C2).      The domestic demand equation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
is estimated over the period 1947-72, although the international prices&#13;
variables must be set equal to the 1958 value over.the first portion of&#13;
1.1,&#13;
the sample. The estimated coefficient values sare:&#13;

These estimates were made using ordinary least squares and an&#13;
iterative Cochran-Orcutt correction for. autocorrelation. Estimates made&#13;
using two stage least squares yield quite similar estimates, a result which&#13;
might be expected using a short data series or which mieht sug2est that&#13;
prices are predetermined and not endogenous.&#13;
The domestic supply equation is estimated with price as the dependent&#13;
variable using 1947-72 data. The weighted sum of input prices is assumed to&#13;
be exogenous, an assumption that wJill hold if the footwear industry is not&#13;
12&#13;
the major buyer of the inputs.&#13;

(-.41)      (17.8)&#13;
The coefficient for the change in quantity is not significant, and the unexpected&#13;
negative sign suggests economies of scale in production wnici are un±iKely in&#13;
the footwear industry.   The estimates are conslstcnt with other empirical&#13;
price equation analyses wh'ch su-ggest that constant returns to scale occur&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
in the industry. Consequently price is not dependent on the scale of output&#13;
(Perry, and Szenberg et. al. Chapter 2)..&#13;
Unfortunately, adequate data is not available to estimate a comparable&#13;
import price equation. The United States is assumed to be a price taker in&#13;
the international shoe market, an assumption consistent with Richardson's&#13;
results. This assumption does not limit the simulation analysis because the&#13;
critical issue is how to project the rate of change of foreign costs relative&#13;
tc U.S. costs, and changes in foreign versus U.S. productivity.&#13;
V. Output Simulations With and Without Government Intervention&#13;
Based on the parameter estimates above, the model is simulated for&#13;
the case of no government intervention in the economy, and then again allowing&#13;
for a recent proposal by the International Trade Commission to introduce a&#13;
policy of sharply increased tariffs on imports above a certain level.&#13;
The basic scenario assumes that U.S. real growth will continue at&#13;
the same rate over the next decade as was experienced over the past decade, that&#13;
is at 3.2 percent per annum. Obviously, if the U.S. growth rate falls due say to&#13;
energy constraints, prospects for any single industry such as footwear will&#13;
be less favorable, while any acceleration in the growth rate due, for example,&#13;
to an improving investment climate, will improve its prospects.&#13;
With respect to rising costs of production in the United States and&#13;
abroad, and any offsetting productivity gains, there are several ways to allow&#13;
for these interrelated factors. One possibility is to assume that input cost&#13;
increases occur at the same rate in the United States as abroad, but that pro-&#13;
ductivity in the shoe industry increases at a faster rate abroad than in the&#13;
United States.    More rapid foreign productivity increases might occur because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
of the faster rate of increase in foreign output, implying that a larger percentage&#13;
of foreign output will be produced with newer. more efficient machinery.&#13;
Another way of viewing the process is to assume that any productivity&#13;
changes are comparable in the U.S. and foreign shoe industries-, but to allow for&#13;
14&#13;
different rates of cost increase in the United States and abroad,.    This&#13;
scenario corresponds to the suggestion that the United States is pricing itself&#13;
out of the shoe market because U,.S. wages rise over time while the wages paid&#13;
by foreign suppliers remain fairly constant due to the availability of a low&#13;
wage pool of workers.&#13;
The simulations include two different sets of values with respect to&#13;
relative productivities and input cost changes. In the first case, foreign&#13;
productivity is assumed to increase twice as quickly as in the United States,&#13;
with Input costs ris-ing at the same annual rate of eight percent. The numerical&#13;
results derived are equivalent.to those which would be obtained if product-ivity&#13;
changes.were assumed to be comparable, but U.-S. footwear production costs rose&#13;
a .third again as quickly as abroad. The second numerical example rest-s on&#13;
foreign productivity increasing four times as. fast as in the United States, with&#13;
input cost inflation as above. The results correspond to-those that would obtain&#13;
if productivity changes were identical.but U.S. input cosrs ros-e four times as&#13;
fast as abroad. While' the latter case may seem;extreme, it is included to&#13;
illustrate the non-linearity of the projected results,&#13;
Under these conditions, the projections of ourput changes in the&#13;
initial year and cumulatively after ten years, as well as the accompanying&#13;
employment changes, are as reported in Table 3 us-ing 1976 as the base year,&#13;
The figures suggest that whether 'U.S. footwear'output- increatses or declines&#13;

is dependent on relative cost and productivity changes, the cumulative 10&#13;
year change varying from an increase of 5.6 percent to a decrease of 15.7&#13;
percent depending on the scenario. At the end of the decade, the secular&#13;
decline in employment will range from 10 percent to 28 percent of the footwear&#13;
labor force. These figures are for the industry as a whole and ignore the&#13;
fact that some firms (the large ones) will expand due to distribution economies&#13;
and the ability to respond quickly to design changes, while some will cease to operate&#13;
The magnitudes of these adjustments demonstrate why the footwear&#13;
industry has a strong incentive to lobby for some form of protection from&#13;
foreign competition. The remedy proposed by three of the six ITC commissioners,&#13;
following the 1977 finding of injury by foreign competition, was that up to&#13;
265 million pairs of shoes be allowed to enter annually at the current tariff&#13;
rate of approximately 9 percent, but that all imports above this level should&#13;
be dutiable at the rate of 40 percent. This rate would be in effect for the&#13;
first three years, and then would fall to 30 percent in the fourth year, 20&#13;
percent in the fifth year, and be eliminated in the sixth year.&#13;
Since footwear imports in 1976 were 370 million pairs, the effect of&#13;
the proposal clearly is to reduce imports. However, to project how much they&#13;
will be reduced we must ask, refering to Figure 3, whether the additional&#13;
tariff leads to a potential price greater than or less than Pm, the price which&#13;
would be consistent with imports of exactly 265 million pairs of shoes. If the&#13;
40 percent tariff leads to a potential price greater than im, then imports will&#13;
not fall below 265 million pairs, since the tariff is not effective at that&#13;
level of imports, but the price will rise to 'Pm. Alternatively, if the 40&#13;
percent tariff results in a price rise less than im, then imports will not fall&#13;
to 265 million pairs, and some additional tariff revenue will be collected.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Because of growth in income and changes in productivity in each&#13;
succeeding year, the effect of the quota-tariff policy must be assessed in the&#13;
dynamic framework already developed. The tariff equivalent of the quota of&#13;
265 million pairs of shoes varies over time, but whether this variation is&#13;
important or not depends upon whether the quota is binding and the additional&#13;
tariff inoperative, or whether the additional tariff is operative and imports&#13;
exceed the quota level. We might expect that the quota is binding initially&#13;
since the desired reduction in imports can be achieved with a rise in price&#13;
smaller than that which would,result under a 40 percent tariff.   However, as&#13;
demand expands over time and imports become relatively cheaper due to greater&#13;
foreign productivity changes, imports probably will rise above the quota level&#13;
since the size tariff necessary to restrict imports to 265 million pairs of&#13;
shoes will be greater than 40 percent.&#13;
The results from this policy of government intervention are given in&#13;
Table 3, also. They demonstrate that the policy will have a significant&#13;
effect in retarding the decline of domestic employment, due to the expansion&#13;
which occurs in the first five years. Because the demand for imports is price&#13;
responsive, the over-quota tariff is not operative in the first three years,&#13;
and imports exceed the level of 265 million pairs only as the tariff is reduced.&#13;
As the tariff is phased out, imports rise quite rapidly, and as a consequence&#13;
the effect on domestic output after ten years is not as favorable as in the&#13;
very short run. The longer the time horizon chosen, the smaller the difference&#13;
the short-run policy shift will make. The policy may be characterized as&#13;
representing a method of buying time, which will not alter very much the long-&#13;
run prospects of the U.S. shoe industry nor necessarily assist the needed&#13;
structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Possibly other factors not explicitly considered in the model would&#13;
justify the policy even in a longer run context. For instance, if the initial&#13;
favorable spurt in domestic growth allows producers to install more technically&#13;
advanced equipment than they can under current financial arrangement constraints,&#13;
perhaps the U.S.-foreign productivity differential will narrow. Alternatively,&#13;
the ability of other countries to expand output based on low wage labor may be&#13;
less feasible in the future. However, neither of these two possibilities seems&#13;
likely to alter the generally unfavorable future projected above. Displacements&#13;
are avoided in the short run, which may be politically attractive to those&#13;
holding office now, but no change in the underlying dynamic factors occurs.&#13;
V.  concluding Comae-ts&#13;
In this paper we have examined the structure of the U.S. nonrubber&#13;
footwear industry showing how, in the recent decade, it has suffered from&#13;
increasing import competition. The industry has declined in terms of output,&#13;
number of firms, and employment, while imports have captured an increasing&#13;
share of the market. We then quantify some possible future changes in the&#13;
industry incorporating various international economic variables in a dynamic&#13;
model of industry output and employment. Using the model various scenarios&#13;
involving alternative comercial policy and the international variables can&#13;
be made. For the footwear industry our results do not offer the industry a&#13;
bright future. Even with government intervention we find a long run decline&#13;
in industry output and employment. The proposed International Trade Commission&#13;
quota-tariff policy is merely a temporary solution which simply postpones the&#13;
adjustment problem rather than addressing it directly.&#13;

7. Although the ITC policy was never implemented, we chose to analyze it here&#13;
since the OMA's appear to be failing. This is due to switching to sup-&#13;
pliers not covered by the OMA and because of upgrading of the product mix&#13;
from those countries covered by the OMA. Further, it appears that the&#13;
intent of the OMA is to postpone industry adjustment, and we are interested&#13;
in estimating the dimensions of this adjustment, if allowed.&#13;
8. This condition is met for all practical purposes in the case of nonrubber&#13;
footwear.&#13;
9.  Since the primary concern is to project longer-run employment changes,&#13;
attention should be paid to factor markets. We have not explicitly&#13;
modelled them because the ratio of wages to capital was determined&#13;
exogenously in national factor markets over the 1960s and into the&#13;
early 1970s, implying proportional employment adjustment to output&#13;
changes. Since that time the growth of wages in t'ie footwear industry&#13;
has not kept pace with national wage increases. Yet the labor/output&#13;
ratio has fallen at an annual rate of approximately 1.6 percent, result-&#13;
ing in a fall in the demand for labor which is even greater than the fall&#13;
in output.&#13;
10. A further problem in the estimation of import demand equations rests on&#13;
the choice between using poor unit value proxies for import prices or&#13;
omitting the foreign currency price entirely. See Richardson for a&#13;
justification of the latter procedure.&#13;
11. For a discussion of alternative methods of dealing with incomplete data&#13;
sets, see Afifi and Elashoff. The method used here results in less&#13;
variation of the import price variable, which yields imprecise coefficient&#13;
estimates. Consequently the own-price and cross-price elasticities of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
demand could not be shown to differ significantly in absolute value, and&#13;
therefore were constrained.to be equal in the analysis.&#13;
12. Attempts-were made to include other variables-sindicating,.the effect.of&#13;
output on price, such as capacity utilization rates, but no signLficant&#13;
results were obtained.   In the reported estfmate the coefficient for the&#13;
time trend was constrained to equal the negative of the physical produc-&#13;
tivity rate.&#13;
13. The theory of global monetarism suggests that similar rates of inflation&#13;
will yield no change in exchange rates. That conclusion will not hold in&#13;
the short run if significant capital flows occur for other reasons. The&#13;
simulations reported assume that the U.S. dollar does appreciate slightly&#13;
due to inflows of capital from oil ex-porting countries&#13;
14. Smaller production cost increases in, the foreign.-ahne Tindustrv would not&#13;
result in.appreciation of those count-ries' currencies unless the co.st&#13;
performance is replicated in all industries and the absence of currency&#13;
market intervention.&#13;

            Output and employment changes in a
            "trade sensitive" sector : adjustment in the U.S.
            footwear industry
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this paper is to simulate
            output and employment changes that occur in the United
            States footwear industry over the next decade under various
            economic and commercial policy scenarios. The nonrubber
            footwear industry is portrayed as a senile industry with
            declining output and employment, a simple labor-intensive
            technology, and aging plant and equipment. Using a dynamic,
            simultaneous equation model of industry adjustment which
            includes the interaction of foreign variables, the
            simulations indicate that even with government intervention
            and favorable economic growth in the United States, industry
            output and employment face a long term decline. Footwear
            production appears to be going through a difficult
            transition of migration to certain developing countries.
