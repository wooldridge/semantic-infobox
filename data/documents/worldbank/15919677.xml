        <abstracts>
            Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is
            working to leverage domestic private sector expertise and
            resources to deliver services that benefit the poor. The aim
            is to help an estimated 1.5 million poor people gain
            sustained access to improved water supply and sanitation
            services and leverage over US$80 million in investments by
            donors, governments, and the domestic private sector through
            three main activity lines: building water and sanitation
            business models for the poor; public-private partnerships in
            non-traditional markets; and, banking the unbanked water and
            sanitation providers. Encouraging creditworthy utilities to
            finance a portion of their investment program using
            commercial debt will improve the allocation of public funds
            for investment. Taking steps to address performance issues
            that hinder access to credit could see significantly more
            investment in water by the private sector, resulting in
            improved access in urban areas.
