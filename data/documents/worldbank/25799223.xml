&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Malawi is among the poorest countries in the world, with limited resources and an&#13;
economy that relies heavily on agriculture. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is&#13;
US$362 per year1 (World Development Indicators 2014) and 62 percent of the popu-&#13;
lation lives on less than US$1.25 per day. Malawi is relatively small in size, is densely&#13;
populated, and has high population growth, all of which put pressure on available land&#13;
for smallholder farming and on the environment and the natural resource base, nota-&#13;
bly land and forests. Oï¬&#131;cially, the population amounts to 15.9 million people, about&#13;
80 percent of whom live in rural areas (World Development Indicators, 2010â&#128;&#147;12 year&#13;
ï¬&#129;gures, accessed March 2014).&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture is the backbone of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s economy, contributing 30 percent of total&#13;
GDP (2011) and 76 percent of total national exports (2012). With 78 percent employed&#13;
in the sector in 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO&#13;
Country Proï¬&#129;le, accessed May 2014), agriculture is also a main source of employ-&#13;
ment and income. Increasing food security is one of the main objectives of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp 2010) and a strong focus on increasing&#13;
maize production since the mid-2000 has resulted in rapidly increasing production.&#13;
However, production risks continue to result in high losses to the sector, including for&#13;
maize. Further, price interventions in the sector over the past year have implied greater&#13;
price risks for producers and traders.&#13;
&#13;
As evident in Malawi, risks can have potentially signiï¬&#129;cant implications on stakehold-&#13;
ers, investments, and development in the agriculture sector. Adverse movements in&#13;
agricultural commodity and input prices together with production-related shocks (for&#13;
example, from weather, pests, diseases) not only aï¬&#128;ect farmers and ï¬&#129;rms active in&#13;
particular supply chains, but may also put severe strains on a governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ï¬&#129;nances.&#13;
Rapid or signiï¬&#129;cant declines in production and/or trade may reduce government tax&#13;
revenues, aï¬&#128;ect balance of payments, necessitate compensatory (or recovery) expendi-&#13;
tures, and/or otherwise adversely aï¬&#128;ect a governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ï¬&#129;scal position. The prevalence&#13;

revised. Total losses excluding cassava amount to US$103.5 million per year.                       ex ante risk-mitigating interventions that would decrease&#13;

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT&#13;
With more than three-quarters of its workforce employed in agriculture, Malawi is&#13;
highly vulnerable to any adverse events aï¬&#128;ecting the agriculture sector, and agricul-&#13;
tural risks are ever present in the country. Over the past decades, Malawi has been&#13;
struck by several severe droughts that have resulted in spikes in food insecurity and&#13;
prompted the need for humanitarian aid. During the last major drought in 2005,&#13;
40 percent of the population was in immediate need of food aid as a result of poor&#13;
harvest.&#13;
&#13;
Increasing food security is indeed one of the main objectives of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s Agricultural&#13;
Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp 2010), and its strong focus on increasing maize pro-&#13;
duction since the mid-2000s has resulted in rapidly increasing production. However,&#13;
production risks continue to result in high losses to the sector, including for maize.&#13;
Further, price interventions in the sector over the past year have induced greater price&#13;
risks for producers and traders.&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural risks can obstruct development and enforce poverty traps, particu-&#13;
larly for a country as reliant on agriculture as Malawi. Because of the size of the&#13;
sector in the economy and the importance of agricultural products for export,&#13;
agricultural growth correlates closely with GDP growth. This means that drops in&#13;
agricultural growth aï¬&#128;ect the entire economy, as shown in ï¬&#129;gure 1.1â&#128;&#148;agricultural&#13;
value added growth was negative in ï¬&#129;ve years between 1992 and 2010, and the&#13;
correlation coeï¬&#131;cient between agricultural value added and GDP is 78 percent.&#13;
Further, any drop in agricultural growth in a given year will aï¬&#128;ect the ASWAp&#13;
annual growth target of 6 percent that Malawi committed to under Comprehen-&#13;
sive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). For individual actors&#13;
in the sector, these risks reinforce poverty traps by cycles of loss-recovery-loss and&#13;
result in lower returns on investments in productive assets.&#13;
&#13;
Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s eï¬&#128;ort to manage risks and to provide relief in response to adverse events&#13;
diverts signiï¬&#129;cant resources from longer-term development investments. In recent&#13;
years, the government and donors have spent US$80â&#128;&#147;US$100 million annually on&#13;
coping mechanisms alone (such as food aid). This was in addition to the approximately&#13;

MALAWIâ&#128;&#153;S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR OVERVIEW AND&#13;
PERFORMANCE&#13;
Malawi is among the poorest countries in the world, with limited resources and an&#13;
economy that relies heavily on agriculture. Per capita GDP is US$362 per year4&#13;
(WDI 2014) and 62 percent of the population lives on less than US$1.25 per day&#13;
(purchasing power parity [PPP]). Malawi is relatively small in size, is densely popu-&#13;
lated, and has high population growth, all of which put pressure on land available for&#13;
smallholder farming and on the environment and the natural resource base, notably&#13;
land and forests. Oï¬&#131;cially, the population is 15.9 million people, about 80 percent&#13;
of whom live in rural areas (World Development Indicators, 2010â&#128;&#147;12 year ï¬&#129;gures,&#13;
accessed March 2014).&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture is the backbone of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s economy, contributing 30 percent of total&#13;
GDP (2011) and 76 percent of total national exports (2012). With 78 percent of the&#13;
population employed in the sector in 2013 (FAO Country Proï¬&#129;le, accessed May 2014),&#13;
agriculture is a main source of employment and income. The variability of agriculture&#13;
has been a determinant of the overall economyâ&#128;&#153;s volatility (recall ï¬&#129;gure 1.1). For exam-&#13;
ple, in years when agriculture suï¬&#128;ered signiï¬&#129;cant setbacks because of weather-related&#13;
or other risk events, GDP growth also experienced an inï¬&#130;exion. In ï¬&#129;gure 1.1, this can&#13;
be seen in 1992 and 1994, when severe drought caused signiï¬&#129;cant drops in agricultural&#13;
production that translated into in negative GDP growth rates. More recently, such cor-&#13;
relations occurred in 2001, 2005, and 2010.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of production indexes, the gross cereal production index shows a lot more&#13;
volatility than do food production and total agricultural production indexes. The&#13;
cereal production index in ï¬&#129;gure 2.1 also corresponds with the ï¬&#130;uctuations in agricul-&#13;
tural value added growth (ï¬&#129;gure 1.1). This is in line with ï¬&#129;ndings from other studies&#13;
that Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s GDP is strongly correlated with maize production.&#13;

    rity, Malawi introduced an input subsidy program in 2005.                            (mm) IN MALAWI&#13;
    The purpose of FISP is to increase smallholder farmersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
    access to improved agricultural farm inputs with the objec-&#13;
    tive of achieving food self-suï¬&#131;ciency and increased income&#13;
    for resource-poor households through increased maize and&#13;
    legume production. FISP also subsidizes certain posthar-&#13;
    vest infrastructure to decrease postharvest losses. FISP has&#13;
    since accounted for more than 50 percent of the Ministry&#13;
    of Agriculture and Food Securityâ&#128;&#153;s (MAFS) budget. The&#13;
    program subsidizes fertilizers, maize and legume seeds,&#13;
    and, in certain years, cottonseed and chemicals. Under the&#13;
    program, farmers receive vouchers that cover a share of&#13;
    the input cost. The number of vouchers went from 166,000&#13;
    in 2005/06 to 216,000 in 2008/09 and to 140,000 in 2012.&#13;
    Maize seed subsidized under the program went from 4,524&#13;
    MT in the 2006/07 season to 8,245 MT in 2011/12.&#13;
&#13;
    For fertilizers, the biggest component of FISP, farmersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
    contribution declined from MK 950 per bag in 2005 to&#13;
    MK 500 per bag in 2012, whereas the value of the voucher&#13;
    increased from MK 1,750 per bag to MK 6,536 per bag in&#13;
    the same period.&#13;
&#13;
    The actual results of the program are mixed. According to&#13;
    a recent World Bank evaluation of the program, FISP has&#13;
                                                                                Source: Moriniere and Chimwaza 1996.&#13;

    reasons are that fertilizers are shared and therefore not       TABLE 2.1. LAND USE IN MALAWI (km2)&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER THREE&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS&#13;
Droughts and pests and diseases are cited by Malawian stakeholders as the most dam-&#13;
aging production risks, especially for food crops. Droughts are probably the most vis-&#13;
ible risk to the sector; very bad droughts in the past have had a strong ï¬&#129;scal impact on&#13;
Malawi, necessitating help from the international community. The damaging impact&#13;
of pests and diseases is signiï¬&#129;cant but the extent of damage depends on agricultural&#13;
practices and mitigation activities. The eï¬&#128;ects of pests and diseases are at times exac-&#13;
erbated by adverse weather events. Erratic rainfall and hailstorms are frequent but of&#13;
moderate or low impact.&#13;
&#13;
Price volatility is an important market risk in Malawi, particularly in key crops such&#13;
as maize, tobacco, and cotton. Causes for these volatilities depend on the crop: cot-&#13;
ton prices ï¬&#130;uctuate according to world prices, whereas tobacco and maize prices are&#13;
mainly determined by the domestic market. Maize price volatilities are largely a result&#13;
of enabling environment risks due to unpredictable domestic market interventions and&#13;
export bans. Regardless of the reason, sudden ï¬&#130;uctuations in prices negatively aï¬&#128;ect&#13;
farmers, the segment of the supply chain with the least risk-management capacity.&#13;
&#13;
This chapter presents ï¬&#129;ndings regarding the production, market, and enabling envi-&#13;
ronment risks for selected food and export crops. The impact of adverse events on&#13;
diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders is discussed in chapter 4.&#13;
&#13;
FOOD CROPSâ&#128;&#148;PRODUCTION RISKS&#13;
WEATHER-RELATED RISKS&#13;
Weather-related risks such as droughts, dry spells, and erratic rains constitute some of&#13;
the most important risks to the sector, although they are more predictable than they&#13;
might seem at ï¬&#129;rst glance. Drought in Malawi happens in a number of diï¬&#128;erent ways,&#13;
notably in shortened rainy seasons (because of late starts, early cessation, or both) and/&#13;
or dry spells during the rainy season. Although these weather events often come as a&#13;
shock to producers, there are certain patterns in their occurrence. The short cycles or&#13;
waves of weather patterns are aï¬&#128;ected by so-called teleconnections, especially El NiÃ±o&#13;
and La NiÃ±a. Teleconnections are linkages between weather variations or anomalies&#13;

Despite this, most food crops grown in Malawi are not                  fore popular among farmers in Malawi. The traditional&#13;

that resulted in the pulling out of a lot of farmers from                                                                                           estates prefer to make direct contracts with buyers in the&#13;

An eï¬&#128;ect of this is increased side-selling to ginners that                                                                                          Eastern Produce sells most of its produce through con-&#13;

ADVERSE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL RISK&#13;
&#13;
OVERALL AGRICULTURAL LOSSES&#13;
Although the previous chapter provides a good overview of the types of risks pres-&#13;
ent in Malawi, for policy purposes it is important to understand their impacts in&#13;
terms of the magnitude of losses, geographic occurrence, and stakeholders aï¬&#128;ected.&#13;
Without knowing how much the impacts of risks cost, where they occur, or whom&#13;
they aï¬&#128;ect, it is diï¬&#131;cult to target often limited resources in a manner that eï¬&#128;ectively&#13;
minimizes the impacts. This chapter attempts to quantify losses in the sector that are&#13;
larger than what could be considered as normal, to compare production and losses&#13;
between regions, and to map how this aï¬&#128;ects diï¬&#128;erent stakeholders in the agriculture&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
The quantiï¬&#129;cation of losses captures production risks such as drought and pest and&#13;
disease outbreaks. The indicative value of agricultural output lost for particular years&#13;
(when yields are below one-third of the standard deviation of the long-term trend) is&#13;
calculated as the deviation of the actual yield from a historic yield trend multiplied by&#13;
the actual area that year. The production value is then multiplied with current pro-&#13;
ducer prices and converted into US dollars at the prevalent exchange rate. Indicative&#13;
loss values are also compared with agricultural GDP to provide a relative measure of&#13;
the loss. Figure 4.1 shows the basis for estimating indicative losses. The dark red curve&#13;
is the yield, the lighter red dotted line is the long-term trend, and the pink line with&#13;
triangular shapes marks one-third of the standard deviation. Losses are measured in&#13;
years where they fall below this point (denoted by the arrows in the ï¬&#129;gure).&#13;
&#13;
Table 4.1 shows the average annual losses from production risks for selected crops.&#13;
The annual risk-related losses amount to US$149 million on average, or 3.98 per-&#13;
cent of the total annual agricultural production value in Malawi. Almost 30 percent&#13;
of losses is from maize, which suggests the great impact of agricultural produc-&#13;
tion risks on smallholder householdsâ&#128;&#153; food security. Similarly, cassava and potatoes&#13;

RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
To better utilize scarce resources, it is important to understand which risks cause major&#13;
shocks to the sector in terms of losses and to observe the frequency at which they&#13;
occur. This chapter summarizes the risks faced by the agriculture sector and the pos-&#13;
sible solutions, as identiï¬&#129;ed by the mission and validated and prioritized with stake-&#13;
holders at diï¬&#128;erent levels and at a workshop with MAFS in Lilongwe.&#13;
&#13;
RISK PRIORITIZATION&#13;
Table 5.1 summarizes stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; opinions regarding agricultural risk prioritization,&#13;
deï¬&#129;ned on the basis of the probability of the event and its expected impact, for food&#13;
and export crops. The darkest area of the table lists the most signiï¬&#129;cant risks based on&#13;
their potential to cause the greatest losses to the agriculture sector as a whole and the&#13;
frequency of their occurrence for any of the crops aï¬&#128;ected.&#13;
&#13;
From the risk prioritization exercise, and based on the frequency of realized risk events,&#13;
their capacity to cause losses, and stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; ability to manage the risks, the follow-&#13;
ing emerged as the most important risks to Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector:&#13;
     Â» Drought events&#13;
     Â» Price volatilities and government market interventions&#13;
     Â» Pests and diseases&#13;
&#13;
PRIORITY RISK-MANAGEMENT MEASURES&#13;
The drought and diseases/pests hazards challenging Malawi confront it on a contin-&#13;
uum of scales (for example, small, medium, and large). The vulnerability of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
food crop sector to these risks is largely a result of the often-poor performance by&#13;
its stakeholders, institutions, and infrastructure. Low yields, inadequate infrastructure,&#13;
underfunded and low-performing supporting institutions, and unstructured markets&#13;
all leave those engaged in the agriculture sector with minimal incomes and the barest&#13;
capacity to cope with hazards.&#13;
&#13;
The fact that Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s climate patterns are somewhat predictable (particularly episodes&#13;
of drought at intra-seasonal, seasonal, and decadal time scales) opens up pathways&#13;

WEATHER-YIELD ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
MALAWIâ&#128;&#153;S POLITICAL DISTRICTS&#13;
To determine whether and the extent to which yield is aï¬&#128;ected by climatic events, a&#13;
study was conducted on the relationship between several climatic events and diï¬&#128;er-&#13;
ent cropsâ&#128;&#153; yield for Malawi. Malawi is divided into 28 political districts, as shown in&#13;
map A.1.&#13;
&#13;
WEATHER INFORMATION IN MALAWI&#13;
The Malawi Meteorological Services Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s database of 23 weather stations&#13;
has daily data from 1961â&#128;&#147;2011, or about 50 years of data from most of the stations.&#13;
Map A.2 provides the geographic location of each weather station (red dots).&#13;
&#13;
DISTRIBUTION OF MONTHLY&#13;
RAINFALL IN MALAWI&#13;
Rain in Malawi follows a clear seasonal pattern throughout the year: most of the&#13;
rain falls from November to March, with the months of Mayâ&#128;&#147;September being&#13;
generally dry. The period from January to March is usually the most humid across&#13;
the entire country. All regions within the country follow this pattern with few varia-&#13;
tions. Figure A.1 shows the average monthly distribution of rain for several weather&#13;
stations:&#13;
&#13;
The pattern is evident in all stations: most of the rain falls from November to March,&#13;
with approximately 200 mm falling per month; even though the period from May to&#13;
September is generally dry, some stations receive almost no rain at all during these&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
DROUGHT AND EXCESS&#13;
RAINFALL ANALYSIS&#13;
Once the yearly rainfall pattern has been established, it is useful to determine the&#13;
annual variability in rainfall. To determine whether a year was dry or wet, the&#13;

the relationship between cumulative rainfall and number&#13;

ity. Because most of the determination coeï¬&#131;cients are very                          ability in yield, there seem to be two diï¬&#128;erent levels&#13;
small, a multiple linear model was also run using each set                          of yield. There is not a linear upward trend, but rather&#13;
of the three variables combined as regressors. Table A.4                            two diï¬&#128;erent levels of production, with a break point&#13;

MACHINGA REGION&#13;
In Machinga region, the increasing trend in maize yield&#13;
seems more gradual than that seen in the regions already&#13;
discussed. Mean yield was 940 kg/ha before 2006 and                                           rainy event occurred during the harvesting season, but&#13;
1.45 MT/ha after. As in other regions, the worst yields                                       the sowing and growing seasons had an average number&#13;
occurred in the 1991â&#128;&#147;92, 1993â&#128;&#147;94, and 2004â&#128;&#147;05 seasons                                         of rainy events (16 and 14, respectively) and yield was&#13;

                                                                                              drought has mostly aï¬&#128;ected maize production during the&#13;

ing the harvesting season best help explain variability in&#13;
maize yield (24 percent). The 1993â&#128;&#147;94 season was very&#13;
dry, with only 4 rainy events, resulting in mean yield                                        MZUZU REGION&#13;
of 444 kg/ha (ï¬&#129;gure A.13). The 2004â&#128;&#147;05 drought dur-                                           Mzuzu region in another region in which the discrete&#13;

MACHINGA REGION&#13;
In Machinga region, yield was fairly steady before 1996,                        MZUZU REGION&#13;
oscillating about 2 MT/ha. In 1991â&#128;&#147;92, yield dipped to                          As in the other regions, the jump in cassava yield in the&#13;
almost half that (1.14 MT/ha). Once the new level was                           Mzuzu region is evident after 2000. Again, the worst year&#13;
reached, the 2001â&#128;&#147;02, 2002â&#128;&#147;03, and most importantly,                            was 2004â&#128;&#147;05, when yield was 19.8 MT/ha even though&#13;
the 2004â&#128;&#147;05 seasons had low yields as well. As already                          the new mean was more than 24 MT/ha. Clearly some-&#13;
stated, the 1991â&#128;&#147;92 and 2004â&#128;&#147;05 seasons were dry (for                           thing else aï¬&#128;ected yield during this season. The harvest&#13;
example, in 2004â&#128;&#147;05, there was only 1 rainy event and                           season was the driest in this year (only 166 mm of rain in&#13;

No regression results are shown for this region because                         March and April may explain the relatively lower cassava&#13;
the determination coeï¬&#131;cients were so small (ï¬&#129;gure A.26).                        yield in 2004â&#128;&#147;05 (ï¬&#129;gure A.27).&#13;

In Shire Valley region, the shocks of the 1991â&#128;&#147;92 and&#13;

CLIMATE AND CLIMATE CHANGE&#13;
&#13;
CURRENT CLIMATE AND WEATHER&#13;
PATTERNS IN MALAWI&#13;
Malawi has a subtropical climate (meaning hot, humid summers and mild win-&#13;
ters) that is distinctly seasonal. The warm, wet season runs from November to&#13;
March, during which most of the annual rainfall takes place. This is the main&#13;
agricultural growing season. May to August is the cool, dry season; and Septem-&#13;
ber and October constitute the hot, dry season. Although Malawi is a relatively&#13;
small country, it has large variations in topography that create significant dif-&#13;
ferences in temperature ranges and rainfall totals across the country, and thus&#13;
a diverse range of agroecological zones. Higher elevations typically see cooler&#13;
temperatures and more rainfall; for example, in the northern and southern high-&#13;
lands. The hotter and drier zones are located at lower elevations, as is the case in&#13;
the Shire River valley.&#13;
&#13;
The main drivers of rainfall are the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the&#13;
Congo Air Boundary (CAB). The ITCZ is where the northern and southern hemi-&#13;
spheresâ&#128;&#153; weather systems meet. The CAB is where Indian Ocean and southern Atlan-&#13;
tic Ocean air masses meet. Flooding in Malawi is associated with both the ITCZ and&#13;
CAB bringing rain at the same time. The rainy season in Malawi is demarcated by&#13;
the passage of the ITCZ over the country. In normal years, the ITCZ begins to move&#13;
across Malawi in late October, moving southward throughout November, and begins&#13;
its return north in late Marchâ&#128;&#147;April, marking the beginning of the dry season. Late&#13;
arrival of the ITCZ means a late start to the rainy season, and an early departure&#13;
means an early cessation. Intra-Seasonal Oscillations (ISOs), or dry spells of 10â&#128;&#147;60&#13;
days duration, can be caused by a number of atmospheric circulation patterns, includ-&#13;
ing episodes of tropical cyclone disturbances east of Madagascar and high-pressure&#13;
cells over South Africa.&#13;
&#13;

sponding to the wet season and cooler periods to the dry season(s).&#13;

VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS15&#13;
&#13;
CONTEXT&#13;
The Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee16 divided the country into 11 live-&#13;
lihood zones based on the livelihood options that households use to make a living&#13;
(table C.1). In all livelihood zones, the main source of food is own crop production,&#13;
often supplemented by food purchases from local markets. Poor households also often&#13;
sell their household labor (locally known as â&#128;&#156;ganyuâ&#128;&#157;) in exchange for food.17 In some&#13;
livelihood zones, wild foods are also an important source of food, especially dur-&#13;
ing lean periods. Crop sales remain an important source of cash for households in&#13;
all the livelihood zones. In some zones where cash crops (such as tobacco and cot-&#13;
ton) are widely grown, they provide an important source of cash for households. In&#13;
all zones, food crop sales also contribute signiï¬&#129;cantly to household incomes. Other&#13;
important sources of income for the majority of households, especially the poor,&#13;
include ganyu, self-employment, and sale of nonfarm products, such as ï¬&#129;rewood and&#13;
charcoal. Table C.1 provides details of sources of food and cash in each of Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
11 livelihood zones.&#13;
&#13;
Vulnerability can be perceived as the existence and the extent of a threat of pov-&#13;
erty and destitution (Dercon 2005). Regardless of how vulnerability is deï¬&#129;ned, its&#13;
underlying factor is a sense of insecurity regarding the extent to which a shock or a&#13;
hazard will result in a decline in household or community welfare (Makoka 2008).&#13;
Although poverty is perceived as a static phenomenon, vulnerability is a forward-&#13;
looking measure of household welfare. Poverty can therefore be deï¬&#129;ned as an ex&#13;
ante measure, whereas vulnerability is an ex post measure of household well-being&#13;
(Dercon 2001).&#13;

   MVAC is a consortium of the Malawi government, NGOs, and UN agencies in Malawi and is chaired by the Minis-&#13;
try of Economic Planning and Development. Its role is to provide accurate and timely information on food insecurity,&#13;
thereby informing policy formulation, development programs, and emergency interventions to reduce food insecurity&#13;
and vulnerability of the population.&#13;
17&#13;
   The household economy approach distinguishes the sources of food mainly into â&#128;&#156;purchase,â&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;own crops,â&#128;&#157; and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;ganyu.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

            Malawi - Agricultural sector risk assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            With more than three-quarters of its
            workforce employed in agriculture, Malawi is highly
            vulnerable to any adverse events affecting the agriculture
            sector, and agricultural risks are ever present in the
            country. Agricultural risks can obstruct development and
            enforce poverty traps, particularly for a country as reliant
            on agriculture as Malawi. Because of the size of the sector
            in the economy and the importance of agricultural products
            for export, agricultural growth correlates closely with
            gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Malawi’s effort to
            manage risks and to provide relief in response to adverse
            events diverts significant resources from longer-term
            development investments. To better understand the dynamics
            of agricultural risks and identify appropriate responses,
            incorporate an agricultural risk perspective into decision
            making, and build the capacity of local stakeholders in risk
            assessment and management, the agricultural risk management
            team (ARMT) of the agriculture and environment services
            department of the World Bank conducted an agriculture sector
            risk assessment. The purpose of this report is to assess
            existing agricultural risks, prioritize them according to
            their frequency and impacts on the sector, and identify
            areas of risk-management solutions that need deeper
            specialized attention. Three levels of risks were assessed:
            production risks, market risks, and enabling environment
            risks to selected supply chains. The report takes a
            quantitative and qualitative approach to assessing risk.
            This report is structured as follows: chapter one gives
            introduction and context. Chapter two provides an overview
            of the agriculture sector and the selected crops. Chapter
            three maps the production, market, and enabling environment
            risks to food crops and export crops. Chapter four looks at
            the adverse impacts of agricultural risks in terms of
            losses, both at the national level and for different
            regions. Chapter five prioritizes the risks in terms of
            their frequency and the severity of their impacts, and
            discusses solutions based on this prioritization, ongoing
            risk-management activities, and the feedback from the
            consultative workshop.
