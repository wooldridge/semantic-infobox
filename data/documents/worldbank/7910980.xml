Treatment of Protracted Arrears                               borrowing activities and to meet the financial needs&#13;

In 1991, the Executive Directors adopted a policy to          of its borrowers, to generate income through its&#13;

&#13;
and to support a sustainable growth-oriented                  The effectivemanagement of credit risk is vital to the&#13;
adjustment program over the medium term. This                 success of IBRD'sfunding, investment and asset1&#13;
policy is conditional on members agreeing to                  liability management activities.The monitoring and&#13;

It is IBRD's practice not to reschedule interest or           monitoring procedures. The credit approval process&#13;
principal payments on its loans or participate in debt        involves evaluating counterparty creditworthiness,&#13;
rescheduling agreements with respect to its loans.            assigning credit limits and determining the risk&#13;
During FY 1996 and FY 2002, exceptions were made              profile of specifictransactions. Credit limits are&#13;

&#13;
There are two main sources of potential interest rate                        incorporated in the lending rates charged on most of&#13;
risk to IBRD. The first is the interest rate sensitivity                     IBRD'sexisting loans has traditionally helped limit&#13;
&#13;
associatedwith the net spread between the rate IBRD                          the interest rate sensitivity of the net spread earnings&#13;
&#13;
earns on its assets and the cost of borrowings, which                        on its loan portfolio. Such cost pass-through loans&#13;
&#13;
fund those assets. The second is the interest rate                           currently account for 61% of the existing&#13;
sensitivity of the income earned from funding a                              outstanding loan portfolio (65% at the end of FY&#13;
&#13;
portion of IBRD assets with equity. In general, lower                        2005).All cost pass-through loans, including single&#13;
&#13;
nominal interest rates result in lower lending rates                         currency and multicurrency pool loans as well as&#13;
which, in turn, reduce the nominal earnings on                               variable-spread loans, pose residual interest rate risk,&#13;

IBRD'sequity. In addition, as the loan portfolio                             given the lag inherent in the lending rate calculation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is&#13;
    rcsponsihle for the prepamtion, integrity, and fair presentation of its published financial&#13;
    statements.     The financial statements have bccn prepared in accordance with accnunting&#13;
    princ~plesgenerally accepted in the United States of Amcrica and, as such, include amounts&#13;
    based on ~nfomedjildgrnents and est~rnatesmade by ~nanagcrncnt.&#13;
&#13;
    The financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting firnl, which was given&#13;
    unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of&#13;
    the Board of Executive Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes t h a ~all&#13;
    represen~ntiotlsmade to the independent auditors during Iheir audit were valid and appropriate.&#13;
    Thc independenl auditors' report accompanies the audited financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
    Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over&#13;
    external financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting principles&#13;
    generally ar.cepted in Ihe United States of America. The system of internal control conlains&#13;
    monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies idenlified.       Management&#13;
    believes that internal controls for exlen~alfinancial reporting, which are subject to scrutiny by&#13;
    managcmznt and the intetnal auditors, and are revised as considered necessary. support ll~e&#13;
    integrity and reliability o f the external finailcia1statements.&#13;
&#13;
    There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal conlrol, including the&#13;
    possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even&#13;
     effective internal control c m provide o~llyreasonable assurance with rcspcct to financial&#13;
     statcmcnt preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of inrcrnal&#13;
     control may vary over tilme.&#13;
&#13;
     IBRD assessed its internal control over external financial reporting for financial presentations in&#13;
     conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as of&#13;
     June -10, 2006. This assessme~ltwas based on the criteria for effective internal control over&#13;
     external financial reporting described in Infernal Control-Jrltegmled Framc~i-orkissued by the&#13;
     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.                Based upon this&#13;
     assessmenr, management believes that IBRD maintained effective internal control over external&#13;
     financial reporting presented in confo~mitywith accounting principles generally acceptcd in the&#13;
     Unitcd States of America as of June 30, 2006. The indcpendent accounting firm that auditcd the&#13;
     financial statements has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of IBRD's&#13;
     internal control o\.er external ljnancial reporting.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Executive Directors of IBRD has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for&#13;
monitoring the accounting practices and internal controls of IBRD. The Audit Committee is&#13;
comprised entirely of Executive Directors who are independent of IBRD's management. Thc&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Executive Directors the&#13;
selection of independent auditors.     It meets periodically with management, the independent&#13;
auditors, and the internal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their responsibililies. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for performing an oversight rolc by reviewing and monitoring&#13;
the financial, accounting and auditing procedures of IBRD in addition to reviewing IBRD's&#13;
reports. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit&#13;
Cornmittce, with or without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting and any other matters which they bclieve should be&#13;
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.&#13;

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
President and Board of Executive Dirrctors&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
&#13;
We have examined managetnet~t'sassertion, included in rhc accompanying h,fanagernenf's Report&#13;
Regording Eflecriveness oj'lnrdrnul C'onrrulsover External Finiinciul Reporting, that the&#13;
li~ier~iational&#13;
              Ba11korReconstructio~~ Dcvclopment (''IBRD") maintained cffictive internal&#13;
                                       and&#13;
control over external financial reporting presented in conformity wit11accour~tingprinciples&#13;
generally accepted in the United States of America as of June 30. 2006, based on the criteria&#13;
established in "internal Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring&#13;
Organization.; of the Treadway Commission ("theCOSO report"). Management is rcspotlsible&#13;
for maintaining effective internal control over externalfinancial rcpurting. Our responsibility is&#13;
to express an opinion on managemznt's assertion based on our examination.&#13;
&#13;
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the&#13;
American Institute of Certified Public Accoul\tants and, accordingly. included obtaining an&#13;
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, ~esting,a~ldevaluating the design and&#13;
operating effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as we&#13;
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our cxaminalion provides a&#13;
ressonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over external financial reporting, including&#13;
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material missratzments&#13;
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detccted. Also, projections of any evaluation of the&#13;
effectrveness ot'bhe lnternat control over externai t7nanc1alreporting ro iuture periods are subject&#13;
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the&#13;
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, management's assertion that IBRD maintained effective intcrnol control over&#13;
cxternal financial reporting presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted&#13;
in the United States of America as of June 30, 2006, is fairly slated, in all rnaterial respects, based&#13;
on the criteria established in the COSO report.&#13;

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
President and Board of Executive Directors&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the lnternatioaal Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Eevelopment ("IRRn") as of June 30, 2006 and 2005. including the summary statement of loans and the&#13;
siatcinent of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as of June 30, 2006, and the related statements&#13;
of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained earnings. and cash flows for each of the three fiscal&#13;
years in the period ended June 30. 7,006.These financial statements are the responsibility of IRRD's&#13;
management. Our responsibili~yis ru cxprsss an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
Wc conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally acceptcd in the United States of&#13;
America and Intctnational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit&#13;
to obtain reasonable zsurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An&#13;
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial&#13;
statements. An audit also iticludrs assessing the accounting principles used and significan~estimates made&#13;
by management, as wcll a cvaliratirig the overall financial statement presentation.         We believe that our&#13;
a u d i ~ sprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of&#13;
IUKD as o f June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three&#13;
fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles getisi.ally accepted in&#13;
the United States of America.&#13;
&#13;
As discussed in Notes A and P to the financial statements.  i l l thefourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June&#13;
30, 2006, IUKD changed its method of accounting f~&gt;rcerlain Board of Governors-approved transfers. In&#13;
connection with this change, IBRD early adopted Staterner~tof Financial Accou~itingStandards No. 154 and&#13;
applied this change retrospcctively to the 2005 and 2004 financial statements.&#13;

losses arising from protracted arrears on payments       transactions with individual counterparties and&#13;
from borrowers for loans, guarantees or related          through the use of mark-to-market collateral&#13;
derivatives. IBRD manages country credit risk            arrangements for swap transactions. IBRD may&#13;
through individual country exposure limits according     require collateral in the form of cash or other&#13;
to creditworthiness. These exposure limits are tied to   approved liquid securities from individual&#13;
performance on macroeconomic and structural              counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        August 7,2006&#13;

&#13;
    The management of the International Development Association (IDA) is responsible for the&#13;
    preparation, intepity, and fair presentation of its published special purpose financial statements.&#13;
    The special purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting&#13;
    principles described in Note A to IDA'S special purpose financial statements and, as such,&#13;
    include amounts based on informcd judgments and estimates made by management.&#13;
&#13;
    The special purpose financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting firm,&#13;
    which was given unrestricted access to all financial records and rclaled data, including minutes of&#13;
    all meetings of the Board of Executive Directors and co~nmitteesof thc Board. Management&#13;
    believes that all representations made lo the independent auditors during their audit were valid&#13;
    and appropriate. The independent auditors' report accompanies the audited special purpose&#13;
    financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
    Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over&#13;
    extcrnal financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting principles&#13;
    described in Note A 10 IDA'S special purpose financial statements. The system of internal&#13;
    control contains monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.&#13;
    Management beIieves that internal controls for external financial reporting, which are subject to&#13;
    scrutiny by management and the internal a~iditors,and are revised as considered necessary,&#13;
    support lhe integrity and reliability of the external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
    There are inhcrcnt limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the&#13;
    possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controts. Accordingly, even&#13;
    effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with rcspcct lo financial&#13;
    statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectivencss of internal&#13;
    control may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
    IDA assessed its intcrnal control over extemal financial reporting for financial presentations in&#13;
    conformity with accounting principles described in Note A to LDA's special purpose financial&#13;
    statements as of June 30, 2006. This assessment was based on thc crilena for effective internal&#13;
    control over extemal financial reporting described in I~iternalControl-lntegrcrted Framework&#13;
    issucd by the Com~nitteeof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based&#13;
    upon this assessment, management bclieves that IDA maintained effective internal control over&#13;
    extcrnal financial reporting presented in conformity with accounting principles described in Note&#13;
    A to IDA'S special purpose financial statemenls, as of June 30, 2006.             The independent&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
accounting firm that audited the special purpose financial statements has issued an attestation&#13;
report on management's assessment of IDA'S internal control over external financial reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Executive Directors of IDA has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for&#13;
mo~iitoringthe accounting practices and internal controls of IDA. The Audit Con~rnittccis&#13;
comprised entirely of Executive Directors who are independent of IDA'S management. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Executive Directors the&#13;
selection of independent auditors.    It meets periodically with management, the indepcndent&#13;
auditors, and the intemal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out tlieir responsibilities. The&#13;
Audit Committee is respoilsible for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring&#13;
the financial, accounting and auditing procedures of IDA in addition to reviewing IDA'S reports.&#13;
The indepcndent auditors and the internal auditors have full and free acccss to the Audit&#13;
Committee, with or without the presence of management, to discuss Ihe adequacy of internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be&#13;
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.&#13;

&#13;
We have esarnincd management'sassertion, inctuded in the accompanying mu nag em err^'.^ Report&#13;
Reguyding .Etjcectivenes~of hternai C'ontrol~over External Fir~rrncialReporting, that the&#13;
International Developrnsnt Association ("IDA-') inaintai~ledeiiectike internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting presented in collformity with the accounting principles described in&#13;
Note A to IDA'Sspecial PUrpoEe financial statementsas of Suilc 30, 2006, based on the criteria&#13;
established in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring&#13;
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("the COSO repon"). M a n a p l e n t is responsible&#13;
for maintaining effective internal control over external financial reporting. Our responsibility is&#13;
to express an opinior~or1 management's asseflion based on our cxarnination*&#13;
&#13;
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established hy the&#13;
American l~~stitureCertified Public Accountants and, accordingly. included obtaining an&#13;
                    of&#13;
undtirstancli~~g ir~ternatcontrol over financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design and&#13;
                of&#13;
operating effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as we&#13;
considered necessary in the circumstances. Wc believe that our examination provides a&#13;
reasonable basis for our opiniim.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the inherent limitations of interndlcontrol over external financial reporting, including&#13;
the possibility of collusion or improper managcment override of cuntruls, material misstatements&#13;
due to error ar fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, prujectiuns of any evaluation of the&#13;
effectivenrss of the internal control over external financial reporting 10 future periods are subject&#13;
to the risk that controls may hecnme inadequate because of changes in conditions. or that the&#13;
degree of conlpliancc with the policies or pr~ceduresmay deteriorate.&#13;
&#13;
In orrr opinion, management's assenion that IDA maintained rffrcti\lc internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting presented in conformity wilh the accounting principles described in&#13;
Note A to IDA'Sspecial purpose financial statements as uf June 30,2006.is fairly stated, in all&#13;
material respects, based on the criteria established in the COSO report.&#13;

            This World Bank Annual Report for FY2006
            notes that the past year saw both progress and continued
            challenges in the global fight against poverty and
            inequality. The Report discusses the following topical
            highlights:  Debt relief for the poorest countries;
            targeting development in Africa; addressing governance and
            anticorruption issues globally; improving partnerships with
            the international community; quick responses to potential
            avian flu outbreaks; and disaster relief. There were 112
            IBRD projects totaling $14.1 billion. The top three sectors
            for lending were Law and Justice and Public Administration;
            Transportation; and Energy and Mining. As for IDA
            concessional lending, 167 projects totaled $9.5 billion. The
            top three Sectors were Law and Justice and Public
            Administration; Transportation; and Health and Other Social
            Services. Non-lending Activities comprises 307 technical
            assistance activities; and 601 economic and sector work
            products. There were 16 major evaluations by the Independent
            Evaluation Group reviewing the Bank's performance on a
            range of activities including country assistance, debt
            relief, development effectiveness, middle-income countries,
            post-disaster assistance, and trade. More than 150
            publications were issued, including Global Development
            Finance 2006, Global Monitoring Report 2006, World
            Development Indicators 2006, and World Development Report
            2006: Equity and Development. While country-led poverty
            reduction and national development strategies continued to
            be important mechanisms for defining country priorities and
            aid strategies, several additional issues moved to the
            forefront of the Bank's activities during fiscal 2006.
            These diverse issues included improving governance and
            accountability, implementing a new Multilateral Debt Relief
            Initiative, expanding initiatives undertaken within the 2005
            Africa Action Plan, developing a framework for middle-income
            countries, supporting agriculture in the poorest countries,
            cooperating with other international organizations to combat
            avian flu, searching for new approaches to deal with climate
            change, and strengthening partnerships to put in place a
            monitoring plan for the March 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid
            Effectiveness. The Bank also responded to emergencies,
            including the October 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan
            and the May 2006 earthquake in Indonesia.
