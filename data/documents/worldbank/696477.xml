Project Objectives:     To address urgent priorities aiming at: improving the quality, quantity and&#13;
management of water and sanitation services in Gaza through a private&#13;
sector Management Contract for water and wastewater operations;&#13;
strengthening and restructuring the institutional framework for both service&#13;
delivery and for sector governance functions; and creating the operational,&#13;
institutional and managerial conditions for priority rehabilitation, upgrading&#13;
and extension projects to be financed by donors.&#13;
Project Description:    The project consists of: (a) the provision of an International Operator under&#13;
a four-year Management Contract to implement a Service Improvement&#13;
Program; (b) the provision of operating investment funds for the Operator,&#13;
built into the Management Contract, essential to fund goods, equipment,&#13;
works and services required for improving services and for attainment of&#13;
performance targets; and (c) the provision of technical assistance to:&#13;
(i) strengthen the newly created PWA; (ii) support implementation and&#13;
monitoring of the project; and (iii) provide independent auditors to monitor&#13;
the Operator's technical and financial performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Benefits and Risks:      The project is expected to produce financial, social and economic benefits&#13;
with regard to: (i) saved water and increased revenues by repairing and&#13;
installing micro- and macro-meters, leakage repairs and reducing the amount&#13;
of accounts receivable; (ii) improving drinking water and treated wastewater&#13;
quality and thereby reducing health risks and environmental degradation; and&#13;
(iii) improving service delivery, increasing per capita availability of drinking&#13;
water, and extending connections to unserved populations. However, there&#13;
are several risks related to implementing a project in the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza (WBG), not all of which can be addressed at this point: (a) the&#13;
potential for political instability, that could have several negative&#13;
implications:   (i) access obstruction  due to  border closure; and&#13;
(ii) administrative difficulties to implement the Service Improvement&#13;
Program by the Operator; (b) non-perforrnance of the Operator; and (c) lack&#13;
of counterpart funds and less than anticipated income generation. The&#13;
project is addressing these factors as follows: (a) political instability: all&#13;
projects in WBG face political risks. The Peace Process has developed&#13;
momentum and passed significant milestones, including Palestinian self-rule&#13;
in Gaza and parts of the West Bank; nevertheless, disruptions due to political&#13;
events can be expected from time to time and could delay implementation;&#13;
(b) non-performance of the Operator: the Operator will work according to&#13;
clearly defined and quantified performance criteria and will be compensated,&#13;
in part, by a perforrnance incentive fee, built into the contract; and all&#13;
sixteen municipalities and village councils have signed a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding (MOU) attesting to their support for the project and agreeing&#13;
to facilitate the work of the Operator; and (c) lack of counterpartfinds: the&#13;
financial analysis has shown that current tariffs, combined with an increased&#13;
sector efficiency, brought about by the Operator, will significantly improve&#13;
financial performance.&#13;
Poverty Category:        The project is not a part of a core poverty program but is focused on Gaza&#13;
where poverty is most acute. It will have a beneficial impact on poor&#13;
households which are sometimes forced to purchase water from vendors at&#13;
relatively high prices during service interruptions. Improvement of the&#13;
quality of the water and improved sanitation will have a positive impact on&#13;
reduction of gastro-enteric and other water-related diseases, which most often&#13;
affect the poor.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES PROJECT IN GAZA&#13;
STAFF APPRAISA L REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    The combined area of the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) is approximately 6,000 square kilometers.&#13;
The 1994 estimated combined population was about 2.4 million, of which 38 percent reside in the Gaza&#13;
Strip. With its extremely dense population of 2,225 persons per square kilometer, the Gaza Strip has only&#13;
16 towns and villages. Registered refugees represent 72 percent of its population, of which about&#13;
50 percent live in refugee camps. The WBG has a per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of US$1,453&#13;
(1994), with a marked discrepancy in incomes between Gaza ($857) and the West Bank ($1,819).&#13;
Estimates for 1995 suggest real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3.5 percent, but due to further&#13;
loss in employment opportunities for Palestinian workers in Israel', and allowing for population increase,&#13;
real per capita GNP declined by an estimated 8 percent. Also, the already high 20 percent unemployment&#13;
rate in 1994 is estimated to have risen to 25 percent. This indicates that the positive job creation&#13;
performance, particularly in residential construction, was insufficient to overcome the impact of repeated&#13;
Israeli border closures. The prospects for 1996 had appeared somewhat more promising until the recent&#13;
bombings in Israel. These have led to extended border closings which have had a severely negative&#13;
impact on economic and social life. Unemployment is now at crisis levels, particularly in Gaza. GDP&#13;
and GNP in WBG are projected to decline by -11 and -17 percent, respectively, in real terms for 1996&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
1.2    The Interim Agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the&#13;
Government of the State of Israel on September 28, 1995, restates parts of the Agreement on the Gaza&#13;
Strip and Jericho Area signed in May 1994, and of the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and&#13;
Responsibilities (Cairo Agreement), signed in August 1994, and in so doing, supersedes the latter two&#13;
agreements. Under the Interim Agreement, increasing responsibility has been granted to the Palestinian&#13;
Council for public services in WBG, including the power to operate, manage and develop water and&#13;
sewerage systems and resources. However, the existing systems supplying water to the Settlements and&#13;
the Military Installation Area, and the water system and resources inside them continue to be operated and&#13;
managed by the Israeli Mekoroth Water Company (Mekoroth).&#13;
1.3    The situation of the water sector is critical in both the West Bank and in Gaza. However, the&#13;
extreme water resources limitations facing Gaza, possibly one of the most serious in the world today,&#13;
demand a much better level of water resources management and greatly improved standard of service&#13;
delivery to be achieved, and quickly. Groundwater, the only significant available source of water, is&#13;
seriously over-utilized and badly contaminated.&#13;
1.4    There is an urgent need to complete the rehabilitation programn which has started under the&#13;
Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP) and other bilateral donors' initiatives. The Executive Authority&#13;
of the Palestinian Council (EAPC) places a high priority on the improvement of water and wastewater&#13;
services in Gaza. A number of donor-supported investment and technical assistance projects are already&#13;
underway in Gaza in order to: (a) extend the provision of water; (b) improve sewage collection and&#13;
disposal facilities; (c) provide a healthy and clean environment for Gaza's inhabitants; and (d) attract the&#13;
1/    About 63,000 job opportunities were lost between 1992 and 1994, and another 29,000 in 1995.&#13;

business which is essential to economic development. The proposed project aims at continuing and&#13;
reinforcing this effort.&#13;
H. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
A.    Water Resources&#13;
2.1    Almost the sole source of water in Gaza is the shallow aquifer that underlies the whole Gaza Strip&#13;
and extends north into Israel. Accurate data is generally not available and estimates of abstractions and&#13;
recharge vary considerably. There is agreement, however, that recharge is in the order of 60 million cubic&#13;
meters (MCM) per year and is greatly exceeded by abstractions estimated at more than 130 MCM per&#13;
year. Consequently, the water table is falling and quality is deteriorating as a result of both over-&#13;
abstraction, which causes seawater intrusion and up-coning of deeper saline water, and contamination by&#13;
seepage of pollutants from the surface, particularly from cesspits and septic tanks. Salinity and nitrates&#13;
now exceed recommended standards for potable purposes over most of the Gaza Strip and agricultural use&#13;
is increasingly affected by high salinity. Municipal water allocation from the Gaza aquifer accounts for&#13;
only 30-35 MCM per year and is obtained from approximately 50 wells. An additional small quantity of&#13;
currently 6.2 MCM is purchased from Mekoroth to supply areas where groundwater salinity is excessive.&#13;
2.2    There are no ready solutions to the water shortage and quality problems. Total annually renewable&#13;
water resources are less than 70 cubic meters per capita, a level that constraints economic productivity.&#13;
Limited quantities are available for purchase from Israel but at a price that is relatively expensive, even&#13;
for municipal use. Alternatives such as desalination and importation, even from the West Bank, would&#13;
also be expensive and require many years to implement. The conclusion is that the Palestinians of Gaza&#13;
must primarily rely on better use and management of their own water resources rather than look for&#13;
external solutions. Improved institutional capacity will be needed for both regulation and provision of&#13;
services from these resources.&#13;
2.3    Furthermore, due to expected improved network efficiency, the current effective per capita use&#13;
(water actually delivered to households and industries) of about 70 liters per day is expected to increase&#13;
with this project by about 35 percent. Under the September 28, 1996 Interim Agreement, Gaza is also&#13;
entitled to receive 5 MCM per year of additional water from Mekoroth (at a proposed cost of US$0.46&#13;
per cubic meter). This will help to maintain the current level of supply as the population increases,&#13;
estimated at present at 6.2 percent per annum, gradually decreasing to 3.5 percent over the next ten years.2&#13;
Even though these changes, developments and additional supplies are far from sufficient to cover unmet&#13;
demand for municipal water, the improvements resulting from the project will progressively increase sector&#13;
revenues and put it on a path toward financial viability, which, in the long rnn, may allow exploration of&#13;
more expensive, alternative water resources.&#13;
B.    Institutional Structure&#13;
2.4    Prior to the Cairo Agreement of August 1994, under which the Israeli military and Civil&#13;
Administration withdrew from Gaza, water resources were administered by the Water Department of the&#13;
Civil Administration. Permits for the drilling of new wells were restricted and quotas were placed on&#13;

and Gaza Strip (December 1994).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                              3&#13;
abstractions from all but municipal wells. These restrictions were not enforced in the weeks preceding&#13;
and subsequent to the handover of responsibilities, and illegal wells proliferated. The Water Department&#13;
was placed under the Ministry of Agriculture when it was established, but responsibility for regulatory&#13;
matters in the water sector will be transferred to the newly created Palestinian Water Authority (PWA).&#13;
The PWA was established by Decree 90/1995 in April 1995, and its powers and responsibilities defined&#13;
in Bylaws (Law No 18/1996) enacted on January 18, 1996. The PWA has policy-making and regulatory&#13;
responsibilities for both Gaza and the West Bank. Its authority in the West Bank is limited under the&#13;
Interim Agreement pending final negotiations of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Agreement.&#13;
C.    Sector Issues and Constraints&#13;
2.5    The present fragmented institutional structure in Gaza, with responsibility divided between&#13;
4 municipal water departments, 12 village councils, and a United Nations agency, is incompatible with&#13;
efficient service delivery and the integrated management of the limited groundwater resources. The key&#13;
sector challenges are: (a) improving water resource management and environmental health conditions,&#13;
particularly management of the Gaza aquifer; (b) improving water supply delivery systems; (c) improving&#13;
the sewerage collection, treatment and disposal system; (d) improving wastewater resource management;&#13;
and (e) strengthening the institutional, financial and regulatory framework for the management of water&#13;
and wastewater.&#13;
2.6    WaterAvailability, Aquifer Overdraft and Allocation. Limited renewable water resources is the&#13;
main constraint for economic development in Gaza. Renewable water, all from underground resources,&#13;
is less than 70 cubic meters per capita per year, amnong the lowest in the world. Present water use in Gaza&#13;
currently is more than double the annually renewable supply of water. An additional 6.2 MCM per year&#13;
is purchased from Mekoroth to supply central and southern communities. Of the cumulative total of about&#13;
136 MCM (pumped from the Gaza aquifer and purchased from Mekoroth), about 70 percent is used for&#13;
agricultural irrigation. Of the balance, about half is unaccounted for and the remainder is used for&#13;
commercial and industrial purposes (estimated at about 6-7 MCM per year) and for domestic use (about&#13;
15 MCM per year).&#13;
2.7    Unaccountedfor Water. Approximately 650 miles of transmission and distribution mains provide&#13;
service to nearly 75,000 metered connections (there are also around 20,000 unmetered and illegal&#13;
connections). Neither the volume of water produced nor used is recorded with any accuracy. Although&#13;
most wells in Gaza and many consumers do have meters, many do not function, so that water pumped&#13;
and used can only be estimated. However, overall estimates indicate that about 50 percent of water in&#13;
municipal distribution networks is lost through leakages in distribution networks, illegal connections and&#13;
inaccurate, or lack of metering. In summary, the average Gaza citizen has less than 70 liters per capita&#13;
per day at disposal from public water supply, a low consumption in comparison to countries with similar&#13;
income levels which typically use 80-120 liters per capita per day.&#13;
2.8    Water Use in Agriculture  Although water conserving drip irrigation and plastic houses are&#13;
known and occasionally used, most crops are still flood irrigated, an inefficient use, since only about&#13;
30 percent of the water reaches the plant. The rest evaporates, or ends up as agriculture run-off or&#13;
drainage water, infiltrating through the soil into the shallow aquifers. The excessive water use in&#13;
agriculture is partly a result of the lack of control over the drilling of wells. Although theoretically a&#13;
license from the Ministry of Agriculture is necessary, it is estimated that at least 3,000 wells, of which&#13;
about 1,000 are illegal, have been drilled in the past 20 years in the Gaza Strip.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                 Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
2.9    Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal Service coverage for sewerage is only about&#13;
25 percent in the Gaza Strip. The rest of the population uses septic tanks, pit latrines and other on-site&#13;
excreta and wastewater disposal systems. The three operational treatment plants are inefficient (Jabalya,&#13;
Gaza City and Rafah) and dispose of their insufficiently treated effluent either into the sea (without sea-&#13;
outfall) or in open fields, causing coastal and aquifer pollution. For example, the effluent of the Jabalya&#13;
treatment plant is a serious hazard for the still relatively unpolluted northem aquifer. New sewerage&#13;
systems are expensive with a per capita cost of up to US$400--which corresponds to about US$3,000-&#13;
4,000 per household. At this cost, full sewerage coverage is unaffordable. In addition, none of the&#13;
municipalities currently operating sewerage systems are able to fully recover Operation and Maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) expenses from users. There is no capital cost recovery.&#13;
2.10   Water Quality. The tremendous overdraft from shallow aquifers has serious implications. Not&#13;
only are these resources finite and will eventually be exhausted, but the excessive withdrawals are causing&#13;
seawater intrusion and up-coning of deeper brackish water. The salinity of most groundwater in Gaza,&#13;
except for small areas in the north (6 MCM renewable) and south (3.5 MCM renewable) of the Gaza&#13;
Strip, exceeds by up to five times the maximum norm indicated by the World Health Organization.&#13;
Agricultural drainage water and leachate from sanitation facilities are the cause of high nitrate contents&#13;
in aquifers.&#13;
2.11   Cost Recovery. Data related to cost recovery is limited. In addition to inaccurate water metering,&#13;
there is no accounting separation between different operational departments in the 16 municipalities and&#13;
village councils. While it is possible to discern the revenues from water and wastewater services, the costs&#13;
incurred by these services cannot be clearly identified, as many functions are shared between different&#13;
departments. Accounts receivable at any given time are estimated at 32 percent, based on 1994 figures&#13;
and estimates. Overall, the 1994 financial deficit is estimated at only 2 percent, indicating that O&amp;M costs&#13;
could be covered with present tariffs, if the collection rate could be improved significantly (see Section&#13;
VII "Financial Analysis"). However, maintenance expenditures are far below a level necessary to maintain&#13;
infrastructure adequately, and no provision is made for depreciation or capital cost recovery.&#13;
2.12   Tariffs. The 16 communities have twelve different tariff systems. Most tariffs are flat or&#13;
regressive and do not encourage conservation. Many municipalities and villages have large "social"&#13;
blocks, allowing water use of up to 20 or 30 cubic meters per month without variation in price. The&#13;
average tariff is between US$0.30 and US$0.40 per cubic meter. About 75 percent of all municipal water&#13;
is used by Gaza City, Jabalya, Deir al Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah. Their average tariff is about&#13;
US$0.20 to US$0.30 per cubic meter (see Section VII "Financial Analysis").&#13;
D.    Sector Investment Program&#13;
2.13   At this very early stage of Palestinian empowerment, planning of sector investments is still at a&#13;
very preliminary stage. Little investment took place during the period of military occupation although the&#13;
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Relief and Works Agency&#13;
(UNRWA) made important contributions and facilitated other donor funding for priority projects. The&#13;
Emergency Assistance Program (EAP) prepared in December 1993 defined a strategy for the sector with&#13;
initial investment priority given to: rehabilitation and selective extension of municipal and village water&#13;
networks; construction of new wells in selected municipalities and villages where resource, institutional&#13;
and political conditions permit; urgently needed tools and equipment to support improved O&amp;M; the&#13;
development of the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) as a model regional utility; and rehabilitation&#13;
and extension of existing sewerage networks and treatment plants. These priorities have been supported&#13;
during the first two years by the ERP through the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                          5&#13;
Reconstruction (PECDAR) and by other bilateral donor-funded projects, mainly through UNDP, UNWRA&#13;
or directly with municipalities.&#13;
2.14   The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) was established in 1994 and&#13;
has moved swiftly to assess sector needs. A rapid review of water and sanitation requirements with a&#13;
10-year horizon indicates that investment needs in Gaza alone are in the order of US$500 million.&#13;
Detailed planning within the water sector is needed to define a sectoral investment program. This was&#13;
not possible prior to the establishment of the PWA. It has been agreed that a Gaza and West Bank Water&#13;
and Sanitation Planning Study will be implemented by the PWA, with funding provided by the Technical&#13;
Assistance Trust Fund (TATF), as an immediate priority to define a five- to ten-year investment&#13;
framework. Pending more detailed sectoral planning, the Bank/IDA has assisted the EAPC to define a&#13;
Core Investment Program, including the proposed Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza and a&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project which will include water sector investments in the West&#13;
Bank. The Core Investment Program was presented to a Donors' Meeting in Paris in January 1996. In&#13;
addition and in parallel to the Gaza project, which primarily addresses improvement of service operations,&#13;
around US$60 million investment program of priority infrastructure rehabilitation and improvements in&#13;
Gaza has been identified in conjunction with local governments. A number of bilaterally supported&#13;
projects are addressing some of the larger infrastructure improvement needs.&#13;
E.    Sector Outlook&#13;
2.15   A future situation is envisaged in which management of the separate municipal and village council&#13;
water and wastewater departments in Gaza would be consolidated into a single, efficient Water and&#13;
Wastewater Company for Gaza (WWCG), administratively and financially independent of the local&#13;
governments that it serves, but accountable to its customers to provide adequate supplies of water to meet&#13;
their drinking and other water needs, and to collect wastewater for treatment and re-use.&#13;
2.16   The immedfate objective, however, is to improve to an acceptable level the quality of water&#13;
supplied and wastewater treated, the quantity of water available, and the management of water and&#13;
wastewater services. To do so, an internationally experienced water and wastewater operator would assist&#13;
in implementing a service improvement program. The existing municipal and village council water and&#13;
wastewater departments would be strengthened, operation and maintenance of services improved, and the&#13;
management and financial accounting of water and wastewater services separated from other services.&#13;
This is expected to lead to the establishment of WWCG, capturing economies of scale, and facilitating a&#13;
more efficient, sustainable and equitable sharing of the limited available water resources.&#13;
2.17   Upon completion of the operator's contract, the fully functional unified WWCG is expected to&#13;
continue to operate autonomously under the direction of a Board of Directors. If the EAPC so chooses,&#13;
private sector management could be continued in the form of a management contract, affermage, or a&#13;
concession granted to the private sector to provide water and wastewater services for an extended period&#13;
of time.&#13;
F.    World Bank Group Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.18   Bank Group Strategy. Bank strategy for WBG has four main themes: (a) restoring and further&#13;
developing basic and social infrastructure; (b) building policy-making and institutional capabilities;&#13;
(c) supporting private sector development; and (d) sustaining the financial viability of the EAPC. The&#13;
Bank has been at the forefront of efforts to help the EAPC define a feasible rehabilitation and&#13;
development strategy. It played a prominent role in setting a policy and investment framework through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                  Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
the 1993 study "Developing the Occupied Territories: an Investment in Peace" and has continued to play&#13;
a prominent role in helping the EAPC define investment priorities. As the Secretariat for the Ad Hoc&#13;
Liaison Committee, the Bank supplies regular information and analysis on aid flows and requirements to&#13;
all parties. To participate in financing the construction effort, in 1993 IBRD set up the Trust Fund for&#13;
Gaza (TFG) (US$50 million) from its own surplus, of which US$30 million was allocated to the ERP and&#13;
the balance of US$20 million to the EHRP. In October 1995, the Governors of IBRD and IDA approved&#13;
a US$90 million replenishment of the TFG and expanded the territorial scope of activities to the West&#13;
Bank (thus the TFG became the TFGWB). IDA has also developed a set of five supporting "Core&#13;
Investment Projects," including the currently proposed Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza.'&#13;
2.19   While preparation of the Core Projects is well advanced, the severity of the current economic crisis&#13;
(para. 1.1) required an immediate response. This is necessary to relieve unemployment, minimize social&#13;
hardship, and avoid permanent damage to the peace process. In response to the crisis, an Emergency&#13;
Employment Generation program has been developed which would create some 80,000-person days of&#13;
employment over the next few months. This program would be financed partly by the Hoist Fund and&#13;
by increasing the commitment to ERP by US$20 million. It would also be supported by accelerating&#13;
EHRP, the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project and the Water and Sanitation Services Project&#13;
in Gaza.&#13;
2.20   The Bank/IDA assistance strategy for the 1996-98 period focuses on the provision of basic/social&#13;
infrastructure, supporting the private sector, as well as helping sustain the financial viability of the&#13;
Palestinian administration and assisting in the development of key economic policies and institutions.4&#13;
To this end, eighteen project concepts were identified, cleared through the EAPC and distributed to&#13;
donors. The proposed Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza, one of the Core Investment projects,&#13;
supports the objectives of the Bank/IDA strategy, particularly restoring infrastructure, strengthening&#13;
institutions, and facilitating private sector involvement in the sector. The project would also build on the&#13;
ERP, continuing its focus on water and wastewater rehabilitation and narrowing the financial gap between&#13;
expenditures and revenues for water and wastewater services. The project is essential to the successful&#13;
restructuring and rehabilitation of the sector in Gaza. IDA's assistance will play a critical role in attracting&#13;
support and financing from other donors. IDA's involvement will also help maintain the impetus for&#13;
sector institutional restructuring and increase private sector participation through the introduction of a&#13;
management contract which will provide program management capacity that will encourage donor&#13;
financing of the water and wastewater sector in Gaza.&#13;
3/     Other core projects are: Municipal Infrastructure and Development Project (FY96); Palestinian Housing&#13;
and Housing Finance (FY97); Border and Local Estates (FY97); and Electricity Sector Investment and&#13;
Management (FY97).&#13;
4/     The new strategy was summnarized in a note presented to the Board on April 25, 1996 entitled "The&#13;
West Bank and Gaza: The World Bank's Response to the Current Economic Crisis: An Interim&#13;
Strategy," dated April 23, 1996.&#13;

III. SECTOR RESTRUCTURING&#13;
A.    Sector Objectives&#13;
3.1    The short-term strategy for the water and wastewater sector in WBG is to: (a) improve the&#13;
quantity of water and strengthen regulatory controls over the Gaza aquifer; institute effective conservation&#13;
practices to reduce losses and manage demand; improve the quality and management of water; (b) involve&#13;
the private sector in the provision and management of services; (c) continue to implement a program of&#13;
priority water network rehabilitation and expand piped water coverage to selected municipalities and&#13;
villages; implement a program of priority sewerage network and treatment plant rehabilitation; and develop&#13;
new wells; (d) lay the basis for long-term institutional reform; (e) create regional water and wastewater&#13;
companies by rationalizing and consolidating individual municipal utility departments and village councils;&#13;
(f) establish effective data collection and cost recovery policies and systems; and (g) establish an effective&#13;
regulatory framework. The medium- and long-term strategy is to: (a) develop and implement coherent&#13;
water resources management policies for the West Bank and for Gaza, including particularly a wastewater&#13;
re-use policy for Gaza; (b) develop regional water resources management policy with Jordan and Israel;&#13;
(c) extend and consolidate a program of priority network rehabilitation; expand piped water coverage to&#13;
all villages; (d) develop additional new wells in the context of an overall water resources management&#13;
strategy; (e) consider desalination subject to economic feasibility; (f) develop and implement a long-term&#13;
WBG-wide program of improvement to sewerage networks and treatment plants, and reclaimed water re-&#13;
use; and (g) increase private sector participation in the provision of services.&#13;
B.    Palestinian Council's Water Policy&#13;
3.2    The PWA has a number of agreements relating to water resources contained in the Interim&#13;
Agreement. These include management to prevent harm to the water resources, continued supply of water&#13;
to Settlements and the Military Installation Area, and payment of the real cost of water purchased from&#13;
Mekoroth. Law 18 of January 18, 1996 empowering the PWA to exercise its functions provides the&#13;
overall direction of sectoral policy. The PWA presented IDA with a detailed statement of Flements of&#13;
a Palestinian Water Policy. A key factor of the EAPC's water policy is the separation between regulatory&#13;
functions and service delivery. The PWA will be in charge of regulation, comprising tariff review, water&#13;
law and legislation, water extraction licensing and monitoring, overall sector planning and coordination,&#13;
and establishing standards for drinking water and wastewater quality, as well as other technical standards.&#13;
3.3    The legislation also establishes a Water Council to make decisions on sectoral policy, water&#13;
management, tariffs, and key organizational arrangements. The Water Council comprises representatives&#13;
of relevant ministries and research institutions. The role, mandate, scope of work and powers of the PWA&#13;
and its commissioner are defined in the legislation.&#13;
3.4    Water ResourcesPlanning/lInstitutionalStudy. During the first year of the project, the PWA will&#13;
carry out a Water Resources Planning/Institutional Study for the WBG, financed by the TATF, and&#13;
managed by IDA. The objectives of this study would be to formulate a vision for the water sector;&#13;
contribute to sector policy development and water resources strategy; develop plans for optimal use of&#13;
water allocations in accordance with the provision of Article 40 (Water and Sewage) of the Interim&#13;
Agreement; determine priority investments and estimate costs for a five- to ten-year investment program;&#13;
and assist to define a more appropriate institutional framework for service delivery.&#13;
&#13;

C.    The New Institutional Framework&#13;
3.5    As indicated in previous sections, it is expected that in the future, water and sewerage&#13;
responsibilities in WBG will be merged into a small number of regional utility companies along similar&#13;
lines to the JWU in the Ramallah District. In Gaza a single company (WWCG) is envisaged. However,&#13;
in the short term, service provision in Gaza will remain the responsibility of municipalities and village&#13;
councils and a Management Contract Operator (Operator) will implement a Service Improvement Program.&#13;
3.6    The above policy has been agreed to by all municipalities, village councils in Gaza and the&#13;
PWA and translated into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by all parties. It states that&#13;
the municipalities and village councils support the proposed Service Improvement Program and are willing&#13;
to cooperate and facilitate the assistance to be provided by an Operator. The municipalities and village&#13;
councils will also maintain, as a minimum, present operating levels and financing of water supply and&#13;
sanitation in their respective areas including staff, power and consumables. Moreover, they support in&#13;
principle the proposed WWCG, the form of which has yet to be determined and agreed; and they will&#13;
collaborate and cooperate fully with the Operator to facilitate necessary preparatory activities that will be&#13;
required in order to make a decision to proceed with the establishment of WWCG.&#13;
3.7   Implementation of the Management Contract would be facilitated by a Steering Committee (SC),&#13;
which was recently established and could subsequently become the Board of the WWCG. It comprises&#13;
representatives of the municipalities and village councils, consumers, the PWA, and appropriate ministries&#13;
of the EAPC. The SC would oversee and guide the activities of the Operator and provide advice to the&#13;
PWA.&#13;
3.8    The assistance provided by the Operator would be coordinated by a Technical Counterpart Team&#13;
(TCT) of responsible water engineers from municipalities and village councils. The TCT would work&#13;
hand in hand with the Operator, and facilitate access to and cooperation with the 16 municipalities and&#13;
village councils.&#13;
IV. PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.    Program Objectives and Description&#13;
4.1    The proposed project is designed within the framework of a program addressing the priority needs&#13;
for WBG as originally defined in the water and wastewater component of the three-year EAP. The&#13;
objective of the program is to improve the quality, quantity and management of water and wastewater&#13;
services in the WBG. It includes equipment procurement; upgrading and extension of municipal water&#13;
supply networks; rehabilitation, extension and construction of municipal storm-water and sewerage&#13;
networks; improvement of village water distribution and related programs; the drilling of new wells; and&#13;
improving management of water and wastewater services. For Gaza, the program includes: (a) the&#13;
provision of an Intemational Operator to implement a Service Improvement Program together with the&#13;
provision of operating capital for the Operator; (b) finance for investment in rehabilitation projects and&#13;
provision of additional water and wastewater facilities in areas where they are most urgently required&#13;
(through bilateral funding); and (c) Technical Assistance (TA) and Institutional Capacity Development.&#13;
A description of the program is given in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                          9&#13;
B.    Project Objectives and Description&#13;
4.2    Within the framework of the program, the project would address urgent priorities aimed at&#13;
improving the quality, quantity and management of water and wastewater services in Gaza. The proposed&#13;
Management Contract is a means to this end. The project will assist the EAPC in meeting urgent needs&#13;
(not covered under ERP) through: (a) improving water and sanitation services through a private sector&#13;
Management Contract for water and wastewater operations; (b) strengthening and restructuring the&#13;
institutional framework for both service delivery and for sector govemance functions; and (c) creating the&#13;
operational, institutional and managerial conditions for priority rehabilitation, upgrading and extension&#13;
projects to be financed by donors. The US$28 million project (including contingencies) consists of a&#13;
Management Contract (base fee of US$8.8 million, incentive fee of US$3 million); operating investment&#13;
(US$15 million including local contribution of US$3 million); and a TA component (US$1.2 million).&#13;
(a)    Management Contract Fees (US$1 1.8 million). The provision of an International Operator&#13;
under a four-year Management Contract to implement a Service Improvement Program.&#13;
In the first phase, the Operator will help improve the capacity and service delivery of&#13;
local, municipal and village council water departments, and in the second phase, will&#13;
assist in the creation of the WWCG that would consolidate the water services of the&#13;
municipalities and village councils.  Part of the Operator's payments will be a&#13;
performance incentive fee based upon the attainment of specific performance targets;&#13;
(b)    Operating Investment (US$15 million--TFGWB US$12 million and local contribution&#13;
US$3 million). The provision of operating investment funds for the Operator (US$12&#13;
million), built into the Management Contract, is essential to fund goods, works and&#13;
services required for improving water and wastewater services. Under the proposed&#13;
Service Improvement Program, it was agreed with all municipalities and village councils&#13;
that they will maintain, as a minimum, present operating levels of financing of water&#13;
supply and sanitation, including staff, power and consumables. The increase in efficiency&#13;
under the project of operating the water supply and sanitation systems in Gaza will result&#13;
in greater use of consumables, such as chlorine and fuel, as well as additional workload&#13;
on staff of the municipalities and village councils. The project includes US$0.35 million&#13;
(for the sake of efficiency, through the Operator) to finance part of these incremental&#13;
operating expenses. As the income from the Service Improvement Program increases, it&#13;
is projected that the systems will generate a minimum of US$3 million in revenues as a&#13;
local contribution to the project.&#13;
(c)    Technical Assistance and Institutional Capacity Development (US$1.2 million). The&#13;
provision of consultants including independent auditors to monitor the Operator's&#13;
technical and financial performance, a Project Manager, and an accountant, and equipment&#13;
to:  (i) strengthen the newly created PWA; and (ii) support implementation and&#13;
monitoring of the project.&#13;
4.3    The IDA Project File contains the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the auditors and other specialists&#13;
needed to strengthen the PWA and support monitoring and implementation of the project, and other&#13;
relevant documents as listed in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                               Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
C.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.4    The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" consistent with&#13;
the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment."  The&#13;
Environmental Planning Directorate of the MOPIC has not issued environmnental assessment guidelines&#13;
for use in the WBG. However, once these procedures are issued they would be applicable to the proposed&#13;
project and to the parallel investment program. All investment projects (in excess of 100) which would&#13;
be financed in parallel by donors (outside the scope of the project) are subject to field-based review&#13;
against a set of criteria which include an assessment of environmental impacts. All selected projects will&#13;
be submitted for review and approval by Palestinian environmental authorities and by IDA environmental&#13;
specialists. Currently there are no known project proposals whose implementation would require land&#13;
acquisition or result in involuntary resettlement. No known archaeological or historical sites would be&#13;
affected by rehabilitation of sub-projects to be supported, nor does the operating investment component&#13;
of the project raise any international water issues. The project will not support major expansion or&#13;
rehabilitation of existing wastewater treatment facilities, for which bilateral funding would be used, but&#13;
will ensure that any expansion of wastewater collection facilities does not result in unacceptable&#13;
overloading of treatment facilities. The project would give particular attention to the findings and&#13;
recommendations of the report on Wastewater Treatment and Re-use Strategy for Gaza and the West Bank&#13;
commissioned by PECDAR in 1994. Implementation of the project would result in significant&#13;
improvement in the management of water and wastewater services in Gaza and in the regulation of&#13;
abstractions from the seriously overdrawn and contaminated Gaza aquifer. Staffing requirements of the&#13;
Operator require a sewerage engineer with experience in regulation of industrial wastewater, wastewater&#13;
treatment and reclaimed water re-use. The project also required, during its preparation, the issuance of&#13;
Bylaws for the PWA to exercise policy and regulatory functions (enacted as Law 18/1996). Technical&#13;
assistance will support improved control over groundwater abstractions.  Annex 2 includes the&#13;
Environmental Analysis.&#13;
D.    Investment Program&#13;
4.5    A capital investment program which is part of the larger programn for Gaza (para. 4.1) is to be&#13;
implemented as a parallel but closely linked activity, rather than as a component of the project, either&#13;
directly with donors, or through additional cofinancing of the ERP or the Municipal Development Project&#13;
(under preparation). Local governments have submitted requests for priority investment needs through&#13;
PECDAR, totalling approximately 130 projects at an estimated cost of $56 million. The list includes a&#13;
number of projects already prepared by PECDAR for implementation, but for which funding is not&#13;
available. A number of issues require resolution to enable implementation of these projects under a new&#13;
investment program: (i) few of the priority projects submitted by local governments to PECDAR are&#13;
ready for funding approval without more detailed feasibility review and assessment of their economic&#13;
justification (funding for a consultant to carry out detailed project preparation is being sought and one&#13;
donor has already expressed interest in financing this assistance); (ii) the PWA has neither the capacity&#13;
nor the mandate to implement an investment program; (iii) both the organization and procedures of&#13;
PECDAR would require refocusing if it were to continue as the implementing agency assisting local&#13;
governments; (iv) co-financing by donors remains to be clarified; and (v) major investments (such as the&#13;
utilization of the additional 5 MCM per year available from Israel) require a planning and prefeasibility&#13;
study to define a strategic plan for meeting Gaza's water and wastewater needs (TOR have been prepared&#13;
and funding is available from the TATF). The capital investment program is described in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;

E.    Experience With Past Lending&#13;
4.6   IDA involvement in WBG consists of the following activities: (a) two donor-financed Trust&#13;
Funds-the Hoist Fund (HF)-US$215 million of donor resources (to support start up and recurrent&#13;
expenditures), and the Technical Assistance Trust Fund (TATF)--US$25 million of donor resources;&#13;
(b) the Emergency Rehabilitation Project--USS30 million (FY94) and the Second Emergency&#13;
Rehabilitation Project-USS20 million (FY96); (c) the Education and Health Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(EHRP)-US$20 million (FY95); and (d) the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project-US$40&#13;
million (FY96). The first four operations are being executed by PECDAR. The last two projects are&#13;
being implemented by PECDAR and other sector ministries. PECDAR was established as an interim&#13;
agency pending the creation of sectoral ministries and authorities. Now that these organizations are in&#13;
place, they are in a better position to prepare and implement projects with the assistance of PECDAR, as&#13;
needed. More general lessons learned from IDA projects in WBG are to keep project design simple and&#13;
practical and to ensure local ownership. These lessons were incorporated into the design of the project.&#13;
4.7    Recognizing that successful project activities in WBG required quick turnaround, World Bank&#13;
management has delegated to the WBG Resident Representative the full authority to design and manage&#13;
all ongoing and future Bank assistance programs.&#13;
V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A.    Cost Estimates&#13;
5.1   The total project cost, including the local contribution of US$3 million, is estimated at&#13;
US$28 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about US$21 million equivalent (or&#13;
75 percent of total project cost). The total cost is net of taxes and duties. Annex 3 summarizes project&#13;
costs by component and by expenditure category. Contingencies for the base fee of the Management&#13;
Contract are included in the project cost. The Trust Fund Credit (Credit) of US$25 million equivalent on&#13;
IDA terms would finance 100 percent of total costs of the Management Contract, Operating Investment&#13;
needed for the Operator, and TA activities. This reflects the inability of the EAPC to provide counterpart&#13;
funding at this point. However, as indicated in the project description, as the income from the Service&#13;
Improvement Program increases, it is projected that the systems will generate a minimum of US$3 million&#13;
in revenues sufficient to cover a portion of the costs of operation of the water and wastewater sector in&#13;
Gaza, as local contribution. The financing plan is as follows:&#13;

5.2   In parallel to the project and as part of the program, at least US$60 million is expected to finance&#13;
priority investment projects (para. 4.5) to further expand and improve the water and sanitation services&#13;
in Gaza. A number of donors and agencies have expressed interest in parallel financing (European&#13;
Investment Bank, European Union, Japan, USA, Denmark, Italy, Saudi Fund and Arab Fund). However,&#13;
commitments have not yet been formally finalized.5 To minimize delays and keep flexibility in processing&#13;
the Credit, the US$60 million investment component is not included in the scope of the project and the&#13;
legal documents. However, since it is part of the Core Investment Program for WBG, IDA's team will&#13;
continue preparation and refining of this component and assist in mobilizing funding from donors. The&#13;
priority investment program will be designed and packaged to permit parallel financing from donors after&#13;
Board approval. Nevertheless, these parallel investments are not a prerequisite for the Operator to achieve&#13;
the performance targets. It is expected that this project would assist in raising and coordinating further&#13;
donor financing.&#13;
C.    Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
5.3    Procurement. The Management Contract for the Operator  (para. 4.2) was selected through&#13;
international competition under a two-stage bidding process, according to IDA Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
The Operator, as part of the services and under the Operating Investment component, will also have the&#13;
responsibility to procure on behalf of the PWA and in accordance with IDA procurement procedures,&#13;
goods, works and services. Funds will be requested by the Operator with a fully documented annual plan&#13;
and budget to meet each of the initiatives identified.  In this respect, works contracts above&#13;
US$1.0 million will be awarded under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Works&#13;
contracts below this threshold will be awarded using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
agreed under the ERP and the Association's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). Contracts for goods&#13;
above US$250,000 will be awarded under ICB procedures. For contracts between US$50,000 and&#13;
US$250,000, International Shopping procedures will be used up to a maximum in aggregate of&#13;
US$2.0 million. Goods below US$50,000 may be purchased using National Shopping procedures up to&#13;
an amount in aggregate of US$1.0 million. All procurement for goods and works valued at or over&#13;
US$250,000 would be subject to prior review by IDA. These arrangements will result in a prior review&#13;
of about 80 percent of procurement financed under the TFGWB.&#13;
5.4    The specialists, auditors and other consultants will be recruited in accordance with the&#13;
Association's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August, 1981). All consultant contracts above&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent with firms and US$50,000 equivalent with individuals, and the TORs, would be&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by IDA missions.&#13;
The table summarizing the procurement arrangements is in Annex 4.&#13;
5.5    Disbursements. Estimated Credit disbursement is included in Annex 5. The Credit will finance&#13;
100 percent of total expenditures reflecting the PWA's and EAPC's inability to bear a share of project&#13;
cost at this stage. Withdrawal applications for all categories with a contract value for goods and works&#13;
at or above US$250,000 would be made on the basis of full documentation. For contracts valued below&#13;
these thresholds, payments would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All consultant&#13;
contracts below US$100,000 for firms and below US$50,000 for individuals might be financed on the&#13;
basis of SOEs. The minimum size of applications for direct payment from the Credit account and&#13;
51    European Investment Bank and European Union parallel financing in this program is conditional on the&#13;
effectiveness of the Bank's project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                       13&#13;
issuance of the special commitment is 20 percent of the current allocation to the Special Account (SA).&#13;
The PWA and the Operator would retain the supporting documents for disbursements submitted under&#13;
SOEs and would make these available to IDA supervision missions.&#13;
5.6   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish an SA in a&#13;
commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover expenditures under the Credit. The&#13;
Authorized Allocation would be US$2,500,000, representing about four months of average expenditures&#13;
made through the SA. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the SA would be&#13;
limited to US$1,700,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the&#13;
level of US$7,000,000, the initial allocation will be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of&#13;
US$2,500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. The PWA would maintain the SA&#13;
in US Dollars as a separate identifiable account to be used exclusively for project expenditures and retain&#13;
all supporting documentation for ex-post review by IDA supervision missions. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the SA would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been&#13;
withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the&#13;
standard IDA procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements&#13;
of the SA which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Management Arrangements&#13;
6.1    The PLO for the benefit of the Palestinian Council would be the Borrower while the responsibility&#13;
for the implementation of the project would rest with the PWA. The PLO would enter into a Subsidiary&#13;
Agreement with the EAPC pursuant to which: (a) the PLO will make the borrowed funds available to&#13;
the PWA through the EAPC; (b) the EAPC will repay the funds to IDA if requested by the PLO to do&#13;
so; and (c) the EAPC will cause the PWA to carry out the Project in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
the Trust Fund Credit Agreement. As a condition of effectiveness of the Credit, the subsidiary agreement&#13;
between the PLO and the EAPC would be signed&#13;
6.2    Under the TA component of the project, long-term and short-term consultants, equipment and&#13;
vehicles would be provided to the PWA to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the project&#13;
(Annex 1).&#13;
B.    Implementation Schedule&#13;
6.3    The project would be implemented over a four-year period. Project completion is expected around&#13;
June 30, 2000 and the Credit Closing Date has been established as December 31, 2000, six months after&#13;
completion of the Service Improvement Program. Implementation arrangements for the project are shown&#13;
in Annex 6.&#13;
C.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
6.4   The PWA would have the authority to sign withdrawal applications and would maintain accounts&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. All project-related expenditures will be fully documented and aggregated quarterly.&#13;
Records for the accounts and copies of supporting documentation will be kept by the PWA to facilitate&#13;
auditing. During negotiations, assurances were given that: (a) project accounts, including the SA and all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
disbursements against SOEs, would be audited on a yearly basis by auditors acceptable to IDA; and&#13;
(b) certified audit project reports would be furnished to IDA as soon as possible but not later than six&#13;
months after the close of the fiscal year. In order to ensure maintenance of accounts on a satisfactory&#13;
basis and timely disbursement, the PWA would be staffed with a suitably qualified accountant (financing&#13;
is included in the TA component of the project).&#13;
D.    Supervision Requirements and Monitoring&#13;
6.5    The project would be closely supervised by IDA. Particular attention would be paid to supervision&#13;
of activities leading to the procurement of the goods and works under the operating investment component.&#13;
Staff input into supervision will take the form of reviewing the following, inter-alia: the quality of work&#13;
of the Operator, auditors and other professionals recruited under the project; progress in implementation&#13;
of the Service Improvement Program; procurement, disbursement and coordination with other program&#13;
components and with the EAP; and complementary activities of donors.&#13;
6.6    The following arrangements for project monitoring and reporting were agreed at negotiations: that&#13;
the PWA would provide, on a semi-annual basis, consolidated reports on project implementation progress&#13;
covering: (i) projections for project financing and implementation; (ii) status of project finances,&#13;
procurement of goods and works; (iii) status of implementation of the Service Improvement Program&#13;
under the Management Contract; (iv) statement of income and expenditure for the current and previous&#13;
semester; and (v) monthly cash flow projections for the next six months. These reports would be&#13;
submitted to IDA within one month of the end of the relevant semester, and would provide the basis for&#13;
monitoring the progress of the project and for discussions at the formal joint half-yearly reviews by IDA&#13;
and the PWA.&#13;
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Current Situation&#13;
7.1    Quality of Data. The availability of data in the Gaza Strip, both operational and financial, is poor.&#13;
On the operational side, neither water produced nor used is recorded with any accuracy. Although most&#13;
wells have meters, they often do not work, and water production can only be estimated. Similarly, water&#13;
use is in many cases not measured, due to defective meters. It is also estimated that throughout Gaza,&#13;
there are more than 20,000 illegal connections, but the amount of water "lost" through these connections&#13;
is not known. Overall, unaccounted-for water in the municipal distribution system is in the order of&#13;
50 percent, including through network leakages, illegal connections and inaccurate metering.&#13;
7.2    On financial data, none of the 16 municipalities and village councils keep records of the assets&#13;
they own, nor do they publish financial statements related to income and expenditures of the sector.&#13;
While all communities have separate departments for water and sanitation, accounts are not strictly kept&#13;
apart from other municipal or village activities. Although income from water and sanitation services can&#13;
be identified, the cost arising from those services can only be estimated, since in many cases, municipal&#13;
functions and tasks are shared between different services. Annex 7, Table 7.1, provides Comparative&#13;
Statistical Data for all of the Gaza Strip, as well as for individual municipalities and village councils.&#13;
7.3    Tariffs. The 16 municipalities and village councils have twelve different tariff systems. Many&#13;
of them depict flat, or regressive tariffs, not encouraging conservation. Water tariffs range between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                         15&#13;
US$0.15 and US$0.35, with an average billed of US$0.33 equivalent per cubic meter. This compares with&#13;
total operating costs of US$0.31 per cubic meter. However, maintenance expenditures are minimal and&#13;
capital costs are not recovered. Water sales from Mekoroth average NIS 1.29 per cubic meter (US$0.43).&#13;
Hence, tariffs in Khan Younis and the surrounding central and southern Gaza villages, where mostly&#13;
Mekoroth water is used, are the highest. Tariffs in this area range from US$0.33 per cubic meter for up&#13;
to 20 cubic meters in Khan Younis, to US$0.66 per cubic meter for the highest consumption block&#13;
(30 and above cubic meters per month) in Bani Suheila, Abassan K, Abassan S and Khzaa (Annex 7,&#13;
Table 7.2--Domestic Tariffs for Gaza, October 1995).&#13;
7.4    Only the four municipalities and the village council of Beit Lahia and Jabalya, where some&#13;
sewerage is in place, collect a small sewerage charge. The sewerage tariff, covering about half of&#13;
sewerage costs, is typically added to the water bill. For example, Jabalya has 2,970 sewerage connections,&#13;
about 65 percent of the households connected to the drinking water distribution network. The sewerage&#13;
charge is US$1.65 per month, which resulted in an operating loss for sewerage of US$60,000 in 1994.&#13;
Gaza City has 20,000 sewerage connections and a sewerage charge of 15 percent of the water tariff,&#13;
resulting in 1994 in an operating loss of US$173,000. The overall operating cash loss for sewerage in&#13;
Gaza Strip is US$630,000, again with minimal expenditure on maintenance and no capital cost recovery.&#13;
7.5    Revenues and Operating Expenses. Tariff Collection is weak due to poverty, poor service and&#13;
the legacy of the occupation. Accounts receivable range between 32 percent and 40 percent. In 1994,&#13;
this resulted in a revenue shortfall (difference between billing and collection) of about US$2.5 million.&#13;
The overall water and sewerage operating loss in the Gaza Strip in 1994 is estimated at US$107,000.&#13;
(Annex 7, Table 7.3--Gaza Strip, Statement of Revenues and Operating Expenses). However, it should&#13;
be noted that expenditure on maintenance was far below an acceptable level because of lack of funds.&#13;
The Operator is expected to introduce a uniforn billing and collecting system and mechanisms for non-&#13;
payment of bills. These measures, along with improved service delivery, are the cornerstones to improved&#13;
tariff collection.&#13;
B.    Financial Outlook&#13;
7.6    Under the proposed project, about 15,000 illegal water connections out of an estimated 20,000 are&#13;
expected to be legalized, around 20,000 defective consumer connections replaced, between 20,000 and&#13;
50,000 faulty meters replaced or repaired, unaccounted-for water reduced from 48 percent to 30 percent,&#13;
and accounts receivable reduced from 32 percent to 10 percent. At the end of the four-year Management&#13;
Contract, annual revenues collected are expected to increase by almost 50 percent (about US$2.5 million).&#13;
Due to an efficiency increase, and given the current tariff structure and consumption pattern, operating&#13;
costs would fall from US$5.5 million to US$4.5 million per year. Overall improvements would result in&#13;
an operating cash surplus of US$3.5 million--a dramatic increase from a loss of US$107,000 before&#13;
implementation of the management contract (Annex 7, Table 7.4--Impact of Management Contract on&#13;
Income and Expenditure). Annex 8 provides details of the Financial Analysis.&#13;
7.7   In summary, the above results can be achieved without an increase in tariffs, other than cost of&#13;
living adjustments. It is, however, expected that the Operator, in agreement with the municipalities and&#13;
the village councils, will restructure the tariff system from its current flat or regressive stage to a&#13;
progressive scale and to increase sewerage charges. As services improve and willingness to pay (WTP)&#13;
increases, tariffs can be raised to encourage conservation of scarce water resources and to progressively&#13;
increase the recovery of capital expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                               Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
VIII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Social and Economic Justification&#13;
8.1    This project follows and complements the ERP. It constitutes an urgent measure to quickly&#13;
improve the dismal drinking and wastewater situation in the Gaza Strip, thereby reducing health hazards&#13;
and environmental degradation, and improving economic opportunities.&#13;
8.2    The project is designed to improve the quantity, quality and management of the water and&#13;
wastewater sector. Specifically, at the end of the four-year project period: (i) the Gaza water sector will&#13;
have at least 65,000 newly regularized service connections; (ii) effective water use will increase by about&#13;
20 percent to 58 liters per capita per day; (iii) water will be reliably disinfected throughout Gaza; and&#13;
(iv) the quality of wastewater discharges will be significantly improved.&#13;
8.3   In addition, the Management Contract will improve overall water resources management in Gaza,&#13;
mainly through an increase in sector efficiency (reduction of unaccounted-for water), improved planning&#13;
and project design capacity within the municipalities and village councils, and through implementation of&#13;
a uniform, progressive tariff system throughout Gaza to encourage water conservation and recovery of full&#13;
operation and maintenance costs, as well as an increasing portion of capital costs.&#13;
8.4    The proposed project will produce social, economic and environmental benefits with regard to:&#13;
(i) saved water and increased revenues by repairing and installing consumer and production meters,&#13;
leakage repairs, regularizing illegal connections, reducing the amount of accounts receivable, and by&#13;
economies of scale achieved by the consolidation of services under a single WWCG; (ii) improving&#13;
drinking and wastewater quality, consequently reducing health risks and environmental degradation;&#13;
(iii) improving service delivery, increasing per capita availability of drinking water, and extending&#13;
connections to unserved populations; (iv) protecting the environment, particularly aquifers from wastewater&#13;
pollution and seawater intrusion; (v) creating employment during implementation of the Service&#13;
Improvement Program; and (vi) improving economic opportunities and quality of life for the Gaza&#13;
population in general. The project would also help strengthen the PWA, local municipal and village&#13;
council water departments, and create a sustainable service delivery through the envisaged WWCG.&#13;
Finally, the project will assist the EAPC in the management of a vital resource, and thereby contribute&#13;
to the Peace Process.&#13;
B.    Economic Benefits&#13;
8.5    Many of the above benefits are not quantifiable and will have repercussions beyond the water&#13;
sector. The analysis of quantifiable benefits shows an economic rate of return (ERR) of about 14 percent,&#13;
ten years after project completion. This compares with an opportunity cost of capital of about 10 percent&#13;
in countries with similar income levels (e.g., Jordan, 8.5 percent; Egypt, 12 percent).&#13;
8.6    The underlying assumptions for this analysis are that: (i) the Operator will achieve sector&#13;
efficiency targets as spelled out in Annex 9 (reduction in unaccounted-for water); (ii) given finite and&#13;
already vastly over-exploited water resources within Gaza, future new supplies from traditional resources&#13;
will increase only marginally; (iii) population growth, currently at 6.2 percent per year (mostly from&#13;
refugees and immigration), will decline to about 3.5 percent in ten years; (iv) given the large unmet&#13;
municipal demand and the extreme pressure in general on water resources in the Middle East Region--&#13;
resulting in high water prices in the West Bank and in comparable neighboring countries--the WTP is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                            17&#13;
assumed to be higher than the present highest block tariff in Gaza (US$0.67 per cubic meter), gradually&#13;
increasing over ten years to the cost of supply from desalination, by then projected at US$1.25 per cubic&#13;
meter. Annex 8 provides details of these assumptions.&#13;
8.7    These are conservative estimates. Although achieving a sector efficiency improvement from&#13;
currently 52 percent to 70 percent in four years may appear optimistic in the Gaza context, a one-year&#13;
delay in meeting distribution network efficiency targets would only marginally affect the ERR. Other&#13;
assumptions were deliberately underrated, given current uncertainties in Gaza. Similarly, they would have&#13;
only minor impacts on the ERR. This is explained by the large unmet municipal demand, expected to be&#13;
about 75 percent higher than effective water use with the project ten years from now (Annex 8, Table&#13;
8.4). This leads to a WTP factor which is probably significantly higher than the highest tariff block in&#13;
Gaza. In the West Bank, the highest tariff block is equivalent to US$1.45 per cubic meter. In comparable&#13;
countries in the Middle East, water is frequently purchased from vendors at prices ranging from US$3&#13;
(Lebanon) to US$5 (Jordan) per cubic meter.&#13;
8.8    Water for agricultural use is currently virtually free. Tariffs are non-existent. License fees for&#13;
wells are nominal and are often not collected. At least 1,000 out of approximately 3,000 wells are illegal.&#13;
In some cases, mostly in the central area of Gaza, where water is especially scarce, farmers sell their&#13;
excess water to nearby municipalities, at prices of up to US$0.70 per cubic meter, despite nitrate&#13;
contamination and high salinity. To relieve the scarcity constraint on alternative, higher value-added&#13;
economic development for resource conservation and equity, it is likely that agriculture will have to give&#13;
up water for the benefit of municipal supplies. Thus, a system for charging for agricultural water will have&#13;
to be established. This will allow shifting water from low-value crops to higher-value uses. Likewise,&#13;
municipal tariffs--at present on average US$0.33 per cubic meter--will have to be increased to allow for&#13;
better operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems.&#13;
8.9    Sensitivity analyses have been carried out with four alternative scenarios:&#13;
ERR&#13;
10 years&#13;
(after project execution)&#13;
(i)    Total benefits increased by 10 percent                  15%&#13;
(ii)    Total benefits decreased by 10 percent                 13%&#13;
(iii)   Water transferred from agriculture, gradually&#13;
increasing to 10% of current agriculture use by 2007    15%&#13;
(iv)   Efficiency performance targets delayed&#13;
by one year                                             14%&#13;
8.10   Water Demand Versus Supply. The current municipal (domestic and industrial) per capita use&#13;
of about 70 liters per day (24 cubic meters per year)--one of the lowest in the world--is a constraint on&#13;
socio-economic growth. Based on experience in countries of similar economic development, potential&#13;
municipal per capita demand in Gaza would be 80 to 120 liters per day, between 33 and 44 cubic meters&#13;
per year. This demand will increase, both with population growth and with economic development. It&#13;
is estimated that within the next eight to ten years, per capita demand for municipal water will increase&#13;
to about 60 cubic meters per year (see Annex 8). The savings resulting from improving distribution&#13;
network efficiency and from expected additional supplies from Israel would increase available per capita&#13;
municipal water by about 35 percent, still leaving a gap of about 75 percent to meet projected actual&#13;
demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                  Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza&#13;
8.11   This project is designed to achieve quick results, in terms of improving water and sewerage&#13;
services quantitatively and qualitatively, and in strengthening the institutional capacity. It is not meant&#13;
to resolve all water sector problems. In fact, there is an enormous demand--estimated at close to US$I00&#13;
per capita--for sector investments to rehabilitate existing installations and to expand services over the next&#13;
three to five years. Even if these funds were available, it is uncertain whether the EAPC would at present&#13;
have the institutional and physical capacity to absorb them.&#13;
8.12   The capital investment program, which is expected to be financed by donors, includes well in&#13;
excess of one hundred mostly small investment or rehabilitation projects for a total amount of about&#13;
US$50 million, proposed by the 16 municipalities and village councils. Many of these projects need more&#13;
preparation, and their feasibility and economic justification established, before funding for implementation&#13;
can be approved by donors (para. 4.6). However, it is expected that these projects will contribute&#13;
significantly toward the improvement of the water services in Gaza over the next five years.&#13;
C.    Risks&#13;
8.13   There are several risks related to implementing a project in WBG, not all of which can be&#13;
addressed at this point. Risk factors include: (a) non-performance of the Operator either as a result of&#13;
(i) poor selection; or (ii) lack of cooperation between municipalities and village councils; (b) lack of&#13;
counterpart funds, i.e., revenues to pay for labor, maintenance and other costs related to the management&#13;
contract Operator; and (c) the potential for political instability, that could have several negative&#13;
implications: (i) access obstruction due to border closure; (ii) administrative difficulties to implement the&#13;
Service Improvement Program by the Operator; and (iii) foreign exchange.restrictions that could hamper&#13;
imports necessary to achieve performance targets, and investments to improve and expand water and&#13;
wastewater services.&#13;
8.14   The proposed project is addressing these factors as follows:&#13;
(a)    Non-performance: First, the international Operator was selected by a two-stage bidding&#13;
process, optimizing the likelihood that the best available Operator was contracted.&#13;
Second, the Operator will work according to clearly defined and quantified performance&#13;
criteria and will be compensated, in part, by a performance incentive fee, built into the&#13;
contract. In addition, the Management Contract provides for remedial action if minimum&#13;
performance criteria are not reached. Third, all sixteen municipalities and village councils&#13;
have signed an MOU attesting to their support for the project and agreeing to facilitate&#13;
the work of the Operator.&#13;
(b)    Lack of counterpartfinds: The financial analysis has shown that current tariffs, combined&#13;
with an increased sector efficiency, brought about by the Operator, will significantly&#13;
improve the financial performnance, producing an annual operating cash surplus of up to&#13;
US$3.5 million after four years.&#13;
(c)    Political instability: All projects in WBG face political risks. The Peace Process has&#13;
developed momentum and passed significant milestones, including Palestinian self-rule&#13;
in Gaza and parts of the West Bank; nevertheless, disruptions due to political events can&#13;
be expected from time to time and could delay implementation.&#13;

Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza                                         19&#13;
D.    Project Affordability&#13;
8.15   Based on the financial and economic analysis, including risk factors, the project is affordable&#13;
because expected improved cost recovery--even without tariff increases in real terms--would allow to cover&#13;
higher operating costs. Increased water system efficiency will make niore water available for effective&#13;
use. With regard to the parallel capital investment program, each sub-project proposed for funding will&#13;
be carefully evaluated according to its socio-economic impact on the community, the effect on the&#13;
environment, its economic and technical feasibility, and its affordability at least in terns of recurrent costs.&#13;
8.16  In conclusion, although the financial and technical data available for water and wastewater&#13;
services in Gaza is poor, the tariffs, even at current levels, appear to be sufficient to cover O&amp;M costs&#13;
of the sector, provided that accounts receivable and unaccounted-for water are substantially reduced.&#13;
Wastewater charges cover only about half of the cost of service and need to be increased. Successful&#13;
completion of the Service Improvement Program by the Operator will enhance the sector's viability and&#13;
generate a significant operating surplus.&#13;
IX. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
9.1    During project preparation, the Palestinian leadership and the PWA have taken specific actions&#13;
to ensure proper project design and project implementation, including: the preparation and issuing of the&#13;
Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Management Contract; completing the Pre-proposal conference with&#13;
the pre-qualified bidders, selecting the Operator and signature of the Management Contract; the signature&#13;
of the MOU by all municipalities and village councils; the presentation of a detailed statement of Elements&#13;
of a Palestinian Water Policy; and the enactment of the PWA's Bylaws (No. 18 of 1996).&#13;
9.2    During negotiations, agreement with the PWA was reached that, as a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness, the Subsidiary Agreement between the PLO and the EAPC would be signed (para. 6.1).&#13;
9.3    During negotiations, assurances were obtained on:&#13;
(a)    details of the procurement, disbursement, accounting and reporting requirements, including&#13;
the establishment and operations of the SA (paras. 5.3 to 5.6 and 6.4 to 6.6); and&#13;
(b)   the scope, content and modalities of the formal half-yearly joint project reviews by IDA&#13;
and the PWA (para. 6.6).&#13;
9.4    During negotiations, understanding with the PWA was reached that:&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES PROJECT IN GAZA&#13;
Detailed Program/Project Description&#13;
I. Management Contract (US$11.8 million) '&#13;
A.    Why a Management Contract?&#13;
1.    A number of institutional options for the water and wastewater sector available to the Executive&#13;
Authority of the Palestinian Council (EAPC) were assessed. The advantages offered by private sector&#13;
involvement are recognized by Palestinian professionals, but full privatization-divestiture and private&#13;
investment--is considered unlikely to the EAPC that has only been recently empowered to manage their&#13;
resources; and also unlikely to appeal to investors under present conditions in Gaza. A concession to a&#13;
private Operator involves a long-term commitment (20-25 years) by both parties and even an affermage&#13;
(lease) contract (10-12 years) may not be attractive to the private sector because of uncertain business&#13;
climate, poor condition of existing facilities, and inadequate revenues.&#13;
2.    In order to improve Gaza's water and wastewater services rapidly, a Managemnent Conuact with&#13;
an experienced Operator was requested by EAPC's Chairman and agreed with IDA. The objectives are&#13;
to enhance efficiency and rapidly improve service quality, quantity and management of the sector. Under&#13;
the terms of a 4-year contract, the Management Contract Operator (Operator) will be required to supply&#13;
services, proven know-how and systems to achieve agreed deliverables and specified levels of service&#13;
performance. Continuation of the Management Contract scheme, a lease agreement or a concession may&#13;
become options after the 4-year management contract.&#13;
3.    The primary advantage of this approach is its flexibility and low level of risk to the EAPC. No&#13;
assets, financing, or major policy decisions are given up by the EAPC, the contract is relatively short tenn&#13;
(4 years), and EAPC will retain access to donors for financing. As a result of this low risk and flexibility,&#13;
this solution is considered the most appropriate first step to improving sector performance, especially if&#13;
increased private sector involvement is planned for the future in the forn of lease or concession&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
B.    Objectives&#13;
4.    The basic goals to be pursued under the Management Contract are to improve the quality and&#13;
quantity of the water supplied and the management of the water and wastewater systems.&#13;

D.    Compensation to the Operator&#13;
6.    As compensation for the delivery of services described above, the Operator will be paid a fee&#13;
consisting of two parts: a base fee on a reimbursable basis and an incentive fee based upon the attainment&#13;
of specified goals that are included in Annex 9.&#13;
7.    Base Fee (US$8.8 million). A base fee will be paid to provide for mobilization and operating&#13;
costs during the period of the contract and finance necessary staff to implement the four (4) year Service&#13;
Improvement Program.&#13;
8.    Incentive Fee (US$3 million). The maximum amount that can be paid as an incentive fee for&#13;
meeting the specified targets over the duration of the Contract has been fixed at US$3 million. The&#13;
maximum amount of incentive fee that can be paid annually is equal to US$750,000 (US$3 million&#13;
divided in four equal parts). The actual amount of the incentive fee received by the Operator will depend&#13;
on the extent of the achievement of performance targets specified in the Contract and will be determined&#13;
by the application of a performance factor (composite score) to the maximum incentive fee amount of&#13;
US$3 million.&#13;
HI. Operating Investment&#13;
(USS15 million: TFGWB USS12 million and Local Contribution USS3 million)&#13;
9.    To implement the Service Improvement Program identified in the RFP and achieve the service&#13;
improvement targets (Annex 9), the project will provide the Operator with Operating Investment funds&#13;
of US$12 million built into the Management Contract. The funds are provided specifically to procure&#13;
goods and services for immediate rehabilitation and repair throughout the period of the contract; for&#13;
example, the repair and installation of meters, replacement of pipes to reduce major leaks, and improving&#13;
tariff collection through a unified billing and collecting system. The performance targets take into account&#13;
what realistically could be achieved with the allocated funds.&#13;
10.   Under the proposed Service Improvement Program, it was agreed with all municipalities and&#13;
village councils that they will maintain, as a minimum, present operating levels of financing of water&#13;
supply and sanitation, including staff, power and consumables. The increase in efficiency under the&#13;
project of operating the water supply and sanitation systems in Gaza will result in greater use of&#13;
consumables such as chlorine and fuel, and additional workload on staff of the municipalities and village&#13;
councils. The project includes in the Operating Investment funds provisions for financing USS0.35 million&#13;
(for efficiency, through the Operator) of these incremental operating expenditures. As the income from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
the Service Improvement Program increases, it is projected that the systems will generate a minimum of&#13;
US$3 million revenues sufficient to cover these additional costs, as a local contribution to the project.&#13;
m. Technical Assistance and&#13;
Institutional Capacity Development (US$1.2 million)&#13;
11.   This component of the project includes the provision of TA to: (i) strengthen the newly created&#13;
PWA; (ii) support implementation of the project; and (iii) provide independent auditors to monitor the&#13;
Operator's technical and financial performance. Around eight (8) long-term and short-term consultants&#13;
would be recruited and equipment and vehicles procured to facilitate monitoring and implementation of&#13;
the project (detailed costs are included in Annex 3).&#13;
Long-Term Specialists&#13;
12.   Project Manager. The objective of the Resident Project Manager is to provide daily oversight&#13;
of the Operator and to provide expert support to the Commissioner of the PWA on all strategic, technical,&#13;

unification/merger should proceed and if so, the form of the new undertaking; (h) liaise with the Operator&#13;
and the Technical Counterpart Team (TCT) so as to facilitate smooth communications between the&#13;
Operator and the PWA; and (i) advise the PWA on issues relating to the development of a long-term&#13;
regulatory framework for water and wastewater services in the WBG.&#13;
13.   Project Accountant. The objective of the Project Accountant is to maintain the books and&#13;
accounts and supporting documentation related to the project and to provide daily support for the financial&#13;
aspects of the project. In particular, with the approval of the PWA and the oversight of the Project&#13;

17.   Technical and Financial Auditors. The objectives of the auditors are to audit technical and&#13;
financial performance targets of the Operator against the terms of the Management Contract so as to&#13;
ensure fairness to the PWA and to the Operator, to ensure disclosure and transfer of information obtained&#13;
in the operation of the Management Contract and to oversee the use of funds provided to the Operator.&#13;
In essence, the auditors will assist the PWA in performing the future role of utility regulator.&#13;
18.   The Management Contract contains a detailed schedule of Performance Obligations and a schedule&#13;
which will be used to calculate the fee to be paid to the Operator for a given overall performance. At the&#13;
end of each six-month period of the Management Contract, the Operator will produce a Performance&#13;
Report detailing its progress against each of the Performance Obligations. The Operator will be obliged&#13;
to provide such evidence as is necessary to corroborate its performance against each indicator. The&#13;
Operator will also report on its activities in each of the sixteen Municipalities or Village Councils. In this&#13;
context, the auditors will: (a) review the Performance Reports submitted by the Operator and certify a&#13;
statement to the PWA that the Operator's report constitutes a fair and accurate record of its achievements&#13;
against the targets agreed in the Management Contract; (b) take steps necessary to satisfy itself of the&#13;
accuracy of the report, including visits to works and installations, examination of the Operator's records&#13;
and inventories and meetings with the Operator; (c) be responsible for verifying the Operator's overall&#13;
performance score at the end of each year under the terms of the contract, and communicating this score&#13;
to the PWA and the Operator; and (d) report to the PWA on the substance of the Operator's financial&#13;
statements and any issues arising from them.&#13;
19.   Legal Advisor and Other Short-Term Advisors. The objective of the Legal Advisor is to&#13;
provide legal expertise and advice to the PWA to administer the Management Contract. At the direction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

of the PWA, the Legal Advisor will: (a) review any documents and provide legal advice to the PWA;&#13;
(b) provide a legal opinion for any aspect of the Management Contract as requested by the PWA; (c) assist&#13;
the PWA in the interpretation of laws, regulations, decrees, etc. that may affect the operations of the&#13;
PWA; and (d) assist the PWA in the development of water resource management legislation and/or&#13;
regulation. The objective of the other short-term advisors is to provide the PWA with expert technical&#13;
assistance for the solution of specific short-term problems and issues that could arise during&#13;
implementation of the project. These advisors will provide specific recommendations on specific situations&#13;
that may arise in the course of implementing the project.&#13;
IV. Capital Investment (US$60 million)&#13;
Investment Needs&#13;
20.   A total of 35 individual water sector projects with a total cost of approximately US$16 million&#13;
are being implemented in the Gaza Strip through the Emergency Rehabilitation Project with IDA and&#13;
Danish Intemational Development Agency (DANIDA) co-financing. These projects addressed only the&#13;
highest priority needs and, although of substantial impact, are quite insufficient to meet even the basic&#13;
service rehabilitation and improvement requirements. It is therefore proposed that an investment program&#13;
continue financing--through donor contributions--the many small rehabilitation and improvement projects&#13;
needed to complement the assistance to be provided through the project to improve the operations and&#13;
maintenance capabilities of the municipal and village council service providers.&#13;
21.   PECDAR, in consultation with municipalities, has compiled more than 130 priority projects&#13;
proposals, with an estimated cost of US$56 million, for funding consideration. The list includes a number&#13;
of projects already prepared by PECDAR for implementation, but for which funding is not available.&#13;
Additional projects will be identified as a result of the activities of the Operator. In particular, the leakage&#13;
detection survey will identify sections of reticulation requiring rehabilitation, and hydraulic analysis of&#13;
water and sewerage networks will reveal sections needing increased capacity. Much of this work could&#13;
be implemented through a schedule of rates contract prepared by PECDAR. Major projects, such as that&#13;
required to utilize the additional 5 MCM per year of water available to Gaza as described in Article 40&#13;
of the Interim Agreement, are expected to attract bilateral support.&#13;
Program Implementation&#13;
22.   A number of issues require resolution to enable implementation of the investment program:&#13;
(i) few of the priority projects submitted by local governments to PECDAR are ready for funding approval&#13;
without more detailed feasibility review and assessment of their economic justification (funding for a&#13;
consultant to carry out this review is being sought); (ii) the PWA has neither the capacity nor the mandate&#13;
to implement an investment program; (iii) both the organization and procedures of PECDAR would&#13;
require strengthening if it were to continue as the implementing agency assisting local governments;&#13;
(iv) co-financing by donors remains to be clarified; and (v) major investments (such as the utilization of&#13;
the additional 5 MCM per year available from Israel) require a planning and prefeasibility study to define&#13;
a strategic plan for meeting Gaza's water and wastewater needs (terms of reference have been prepared&#13;
and funding is available from the TATF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
23.    To enable the Service Improvement Program supported by the Credit to be initiated without delay&#13;
(by appointment of the Operator), and thereby to improve management of the water and wastewater&#13;
infrastructure that the investment program would be supporting, it was agreed with the PWA not to&#13;
include an investment component in the scope of the IDA proposed project. Instead, the investment&#13;
program would be prepared and implemented as a parallel but closely linked activity, either directly with&#13;
donors, or through additional cofinancing of the ERP or the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project.&#13;
24.    Co-financing. It is expected that the investment program will be funded entirely by donor&#13;
financing. A number of donor agencies have expressed interest and financing pledges to the Core&#13;
Investment Program (which includes the Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza) were made at the&#13;
January 9, 1996 meeting with donors. Many specific commitments, however, are yet to be formally&#13;
confirmed.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES PROJECT IN GAZA&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
Environmental Issues and Consequences&#13;
I.     Scarcity of water resources and the unsustainable use of groundwater are the major environmental&#13;
issues in Gaza. Groundwater abstractions conisiderably exceed recharge, regulatory control over the&#13;
drilling of wells and abstractions of water are ineffective, and contamination of the shallow aquifer has&#13;
resulted from over-use, inadequate sanitation, and inappropriate agricultural activities.&#13;
2.     At present the aquifer underlivng Gaza, the only significant water resource, is overdrawn by at&#13;
least 100%  in excess of the average annual recharge.  The main use, for agricultural irrigation, is&#13;
ineffectively controlled with a proliferation of illegal wells and no effective limits on abstractions from&#13;
licensed wells. Fees are either not charged or not collected for a permit to drill a well, for an annual&#13;
license to operate a well, or for the volume of water abstracted from a well. As a consequence, water&#13;
levels have declined below sea level over a large area, and salinity, with the exception of limited and&#13;
decreasing areas, significanly exceeds drinking water standards and is adversely affecting irrigated crops.&#13;
Partly as a result of over-use of fertilizers, but particularly as a consequence of wastewater leaching into&#13;
the aquifer from cesspits and wastewNiater treatment plants, the concentration of nitrates in groundwater also&#13;
exceeds health guidelines, in some municipal wells by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, agricultural&#13;
irrigation practices are inefficient and wasteful of water.&#13;
3.     Although municipal and industrial water use is lower, its management also leaves much to be&#13;
desired. Unaccounted-for losses are in the order of 50% of the quantity pumped into the system, and&#13;
tariffs are too low to signiticantly encourage conservation or to provide sufficient revenue to finance&#13;
adequate maintenance, resulting in further deterioration of assets and declining service.&#13;
4.     Wastewater services are limited. Three houses out of four utilize cesspits which contaminate the&#13;
groundwater, and sullage (grey water from washing, bathing, and kitchen water use) is usually discharged&#13;
to surface drains and eventually pollutes wadis and low-lying areas. In those areas served by sewerage,&#13;
lack of control over discharges from industries, opening of manholes to relieve stormwater flooding, and&#13;
inadequate and poorly operated treatment plants, all result in poor service and environmental degradation.&#13;
A particular case is the Beit Lahia Treatment Plant, where effluent is discharged into surrounding sand&#13;
dunes, slowly accumulating in a large plume of poor quality water which is contaminating the aquifer&#13;
containing the best quality groundwater remaining in Gaza.&#13;
5.     The above problems result from many causes: the lack of attention during nearly three decades&#13;
of military occupation, the absence of an adequate legal and institutional framework, the shortage of&#13;
adequately qualified and trained staff, the lack of public awareness of the consequences of water use and&#13;
behavior, and the lack of finan,dial resources needed to construct and maintain the needed infrastructure.&#13;
Many of these problems are the subject of completed or on-going studies. For example, PECDAR&#13;
commissioned a report "`Wastewaier T-reatment and Re-use Strategy."  This and other studies were&#13;
discussed with the PWA and other agenicies and, w.here relevant, incorporated into the project design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;

Project Provisions&#13;
6.     The project will help to address these issues in three principal ways:&#13;
(a)   the services of an internationally experienced Operator under a four-year management&#13;
contract will address the management of water and wastewater services for the whole&#13;
Gaza Strip, improving the quality of water supplied and wastewater treated, increasing the&#13;
quantity of water supplied for high value industrial, commercial and domestic use, and&#13;
enhancing the management of the operation and maintenance of the services. The&#13;
Request for Proposals for the proposed management contract issued in December 1995&#13;
clearly indicated that the Operator should include in his team a Sewerage/Sanitation&#13;
Engineer to be responsible for operation and maintenance of the sewerage system and the&#13;
satisfactory functioning of on-site septic tank/cesspits, including sewers, pump stations,&#13;
wastewater treatment and disposal, and the development of wastewater re-use. The&#13;
engineer should have the competence to judge if a certain industrial wastewater could be&#13;
connected to the municipal sewerage network without causing harm to the network or&#13;
disturbing the sewerage treatment. He/she should also have the competence to give advice&#13;
on alternative ways of treating or if possible preventing the industrial water. Finally,&#13;
he/she should also have the competence to advise on what quality and treatment is&#13;
necessary for using reclaimed municipal sewage water in agriculture.&#13;
(b)    supporting the development of a legislative framework and assisting the PWA develop its&#13;
regulatory capacity to control the misuse and degradation of water resources; and&#13;
(c)    facilitating the establishment of a more appropriate institutional arrangement for delivery&#13;
of services and implementation of needed investments in rehabilitating and expanding the&#13;
water and wastewater infrastructure.&#13;
7.     The Operator will be responsible for improving the efficiency of water use for municipal and&#13;
industrial purposes, for operating water and wastewater facilities properly and preventing pollution of the&#13;
environment, and will include a sewerage engineer to address the problems of industrial wastewater&#13;
management and the reclamation and re-use of wastewater effluent.&#13;
8.     Enactment of the Palestinian Water Authority's Bylaw (No. 18 of 1996) provides the legal&#13;
framework for the PWA's regulatory functions. The technical assistance component includes an adviser&#13;
to assist the PWA design and implement regulatory systems together with monitoring capacity and&#13;
sanctions. In particular, control of water abstractions and measures to protect remaining regions of good&#13;
quality groundwater from contamination and misuse will be priority tasks. Provision for a sanitary&#13;
engineer will give the PWA capacity to investigate deficiencies in sanitation practices and to develop&#13;
solutions to the problems arising from cesspits and inadequate collection and disposal of septage.&#13;
9.     Finally, the project will assist the establishment of a Regional Water and Wastewater Company&#13;
for Gaza, accountable to the sixteen local government agencies that now provide fragmented and&#13;
inadequate management of services. The capacity to properly manage the services, to develop regional&#13;
infrastructure, to capture the economies of scale of unified management, and to enhance the capacity to&#13;
prepare and implement a capital investment program will be strengthened as a result.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

10.    The project will not include major rehabilitation or expansion of wastewater treatment plants,&#13;
which are all committed to bilaterally funded projects, nor does it include projects involving involuntary&#13;
resettlement, sites of archeological or cultural significance, nor sensitive ecological areas. In view of the&#13;
above, and in accordance with Environmental Assessment Operational Directive 4.01, the project has been&#13;
classified under category "B".&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES PROJECT IN GAZA&#13;
Methodology for Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
Part I: Methodology of Financial Analysis&#13;
I.    Assumptions Used&#13;
1.    The purpose of producing a combined financial statement for the water and wastewater sector in&#13;
Gaza was to examine the current financial situation of the sector as a whole. In particular, we are&#13;
interested to know whether the sector can cover its operational and maintenance costs from its present&#13;
level of receipts (i.e., after allowing for accounts receivable).&#13;
2.    To produce this statement, however, certain assumptions needed to be made to fill in the gaps of&#13;
financial and operational data, when the correct information was not available from the Municipalities and&#13;
Village Councils themselves or from other sources.&#13;
3.    The basis of these assumptions is as follows:&#13;
Revenue: When revenue figures were not provided (for Zuweida, Bani Suheila, Big&#13;
Abassan, Small Abassan and Khzaa), a figure of 2.6NIS/m3 (US$0.87) delivered was&#13;
assumed. This figure was derived as the average revenue per m3 for the councils of&#13;
Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat, which are similar in character and tariff structure to the&#13;
councils for which data was available. When not recorded, accounts receivable were&#13;
assumed to be 40% of total revenue, which appeared consistent with other Village&#13;
Councils.&#13;
Manpower numbers and costs: Manpower numbers could not be obtained for Jabalya&#13;
Camp, Zuweida, Small Abassan and Khzaa. In these cases it was assumed that the water&#13;
departments employ only I person per 1,000 connections, subject to a minimum staff of&#13;
2. It was assumed that the salary cost was 7,000 NIS p.a. These assumptions are&#13;
consistent with the numbers declared for the other central and southem Village Councils&#13;
drawing most or all of their water from Mekoroth.&#13;
*      Energy costs: When not declared, energy costs for water were assumed at 0.13 NIS per&#13;
m3 of own production (excluding water from Mekoroth). This is consistent with the&#13;
average cost declared by the other councils.&#13;
Mekoroth: When a council buys water from Mekoroth but the costs were not available,&#13;
the volumes drawn (derived from the Lyonnaise des Eaux (LYSA) May 1995 report) were&#13;
charged at 1.29 NIS/m3 (US$0.43/i3), the current tariff.&#13;
*     Unaccounted-for water: Figures for Beit Lahia and Jabalya Camp were not available.&#13;
In these cases a conservative assumption of 50% was made after consulting the LYSA&#13;
reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
Leakage: As recorded above, local engineers were unable to provide leakage figures out&#13;
of unaccounted-for water. For the purposes of this report, a figure of 65% of total&#13;
production was assumed lost due to leakage and inaccurate metering for all areas. This&#13;
amount is included in the unaccounted-for water.&#13;
Illegal connections and consumption: After consulting with local experts, an estimate&#13;
of 25 illegal connections per 100 legal connections was adopted for all areas. Illegal&#13;
consumption was calculated as the residual of unaccounted-for water after deducting&#13;
assumed leakage; for the purpose of this report, it is estimated at 35% of all unaccounted-&#13;
for water. This omits the fact that a small volume of water is supplied to mosques,&#13;
schools and government buildings free of charge. However, given the questionable&#13;
accuracy of the data in general, this assumption is not significant.&#13;
II.    Results&#13;
4.     Table 8.1 below shows the consolidated income and expenditure statement for the water and&#13;
wastewater sector in Gaza in NIS and in US$.&#13;
5.     The sector generates revenues of just under US$8 million p.a. However, research indicates that&#13;
approximately 32% of this revenue is never collected, hence receipts for the sector are only about&#13;
US$5.4 million. This figure of 32% is somewhat lower than was initially indicated; other reports&#13;
(Lyonnaise des Eaux, May 1995: 40%) have frequently quoted a figure of 40% for accounts receivable.&#13;
Discussions with Gaza sector specialists indicated that this may have been true during the height of the&#13;
Intifada, but that the situation has since been improving, especially in the Municipalities.&#13;
6.     Total operating costs of US$5.5 million are dominated by those of operating the water system,&#13;
at US$4.6 million. By far the largest elements of expenditure are the purchase of water from the Israeli&#13;
Mekoroth Water Company, energy and labor.&#13;
7.     These figures suggest that the current level of tariffs for water and sanitation is sufficient to cover&#13;
all current expenditures and make a contribution of up to US$2.4 million p.a. towards investment',&#13;
provided that all present revenue that is billed can be collected. However, the balance of charges between&#13;
water and wastewater services is such that wastewater revenues are insufficient to cover costs even if all&#13;
revenues were collected. This suggests that some degree of tariff rebalancing might be appropriate within&#13;
a unified and independent water and wastewater company.&#13;
8.     Once accounts receivable are taken into account, the sector makes currently a small operating loss&#13;
of about US$107,000. This illustrates the important role that the Operator has to perform in improving&#13;
the accounts receivable figures.&#13;
9.     A table presenting the estimated income and expenditure statements for each of the Municipalities&#13;
and Village Councils is provided in Annex 7, Table 7.3. These show that the regional pattern varies&#13;
across Gaza. In the Municipal areas and the Northern Village Councils which supply their own water&#13;
rather than purchase from Mekoroth, revenues, and indeed receipts, are more than sufficient to cover&#13;
operating costs. In the central and southern Village Councils that rely on Mekoroth, the situation is&#13;
I/    Which could either be measured in terns of capital expenditure or depreciation and interest charges, or&#13;
as maintenance costs which are by far insufficient.&#13;

different. Once non-payment of bills is taken into account, receipts are not adequate to cover costs at&#13;
present. In Maghazi and Zuweida even total revenues do not cover costs, while in Bureij and Khzaa the&#13;
excess of revenues over costs is slim. The other councils appear to be able comfortably to cover costs&#13;
from current total revenues.&#13;

11.     Looking at the demand and supply factors, supply per capita is low by international standards,&#13;
because of the poor quantity and quality of water, as well as because of low per capita incomes.&#13;
Considering the high level of unaccounted-for water (48%) effective per capita use is only about 70 liters&#13;
per day. Unaccounted-for water makes up an extremely high proportion of total distribution input,&#13;
because of illegal consumption and leakage. Losses per kilometer of pipe are also high.&#13;
12.     In terms of personnel, because of the shortages of labor in the Municipalities and Village Councils,&#13;
employment in the water and wastewater system is not particularly high by international standards. This&#13;
figure in fact conceals the general lack of sufficiently well-trained workers in the water and wastewater&#13;
departments.&#13;
13.     Looking at the network itself, when compared to the number of connections, Gaza has a&#13;
reasonably normal length of distribution network. However, there is an extremely low level of storage.&#13;
Many areas of Gaza have no storage at all in practice.&#13;

IV.   Modelling the Financial Impact of the Management Contract&#13;
Questions to be Addressed&#13;
14.   The key questions which the financial modelling was intended to answer were:&#13;
How much revenue can be expected to be generated if the targets in the Management&#13;
Contract are achieved, including the conversion of 15,000 illegal connections to legal&#13;
ones, the reduction in unaccounted-for water to 30% and the reduction of accounts&#13;
receivable to 10% by the end of four years?&#13;
*     In this improved financial situation, will the current tariffs for water and wastewater in&#13;
Gaza be sufficient to cover the operation and maintenance costs of the network (taking&#13;
into account that they are simply indexed with the cost of living)? Given the difficult&#13;
economic situation in Gaza, substantial increases in the overall level of water tariffs in&#13;
real terms are not expected in the next few years. Therefore, the ability of the system to&#13;
finance its operating and maintenance costs from current revenues (at current tariff levels)&#13;
is important for a unified water and wastewater utility to maintain the integrity of the&#13;
supply system and to retain the benefits stemming from the Management Contract.&#13;
Approach and Assumptions&#13;
15.   Because of the limitations of the data, there is little purpose served in attempting to build a&#13;
complex financial forecasting model for the water and wastewater sector in Gaza. Such a model would&#13;
only serve to lend a spurious appearance of accuracy to financial figures which must at best be viewed&#13;
as indicative of the true position.&#13;
16.   The simple approach that has been adopted therefore is a comparison of two static positions, one&#13;
presenting the current situation as represented by our estimates of the position of the sector for 1994, and&#13;
the other representing a re-working of the 1994 figures taking into account the changes that will occur in&#13;
all relevant cost and revenue items as a consequence of the successful implementation of the Management&#13;
Contract. This has the benefit of isolating the specific impact of the Management Contract without&#13;
attempting to project the additional effect of cost inflation and further population growth.&#13;
17.   The main aspects of the Management Contract which have an impact on the finances of the sector&#13;
are assumed to be as follows:&#13;
Reduction in illegal connections by 15,000: This increases the volume of water for&#13;
which the Municipalities and Village Councils can bill, leading to increased revenue. In&#13;
addition, it is to be assumed that once illegal connections are placed on a meter they will&#13;
reduce their use of the volume of water the utilities need to purchase from Mekoroth. For&#13;
the purposes of modelling, the current average use per legal connection and per illegal&#13;
connection in each area was applied. Consumption per illegal connection is typically at&#13;
least 10% higher than per legal connection. On conversion of an illegal connection to a&#13;
legal one a reduction in consumption to the average level in that area for legal&#13;
connections was assumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 6 of 15&#13;
*     Reduction in leakage: This has a direct benefit to the water utilities in terms of reducing&#13;
the volume of water that must be pumped or purchased from Mekoroth for a given level&#13;
of consumption.&#13;
*     Meter repair and replacement:  When connections with non-functional or poorly&#13;
functioning meters have a new meter installed, an effect on the level of water use is&#13;
expected because the connection will thereafter be paying for each cubic meter they use.&#13;
The size of this effect is not easy to estimate. It was therefore assumed that new and&#13;
repaired meters installed reduce consumption by 10% of the average consumption per&#13;
connection in that area.&#13;
*     Reduction in accounts receivable: It was assumed that reducing accounts receivable has&#13;
no impact on water use, only on receipts. However, it could be argued that reducing&#13;
accounts receivable has a similar impact to installing functioning meters: connections that&#13;
were previously not paying their bills will afterwards actually be paying for the water they&#13;
use, and they may reduce their water use as a result.&#13;
18.   The assessment of the financial impact of these changes was modelled using the following&#13;
additional assumptions.&#13;
*     Impact on revenue: Each additional cubic meter supplied to a legal connection generates&#13;
revenue at the average price per cubic meter currently applying in the relevant area.&#13;
*     Impact on receipts: Receipts are assumed to reach 90% of revenue, because the target&#13;
for accounts receivable is 10%.&#13;
*     Impact on costs: This impact is extremely difficult to estimate. It was assumed that&#13;
reductions in volume pumped as a result of reduced leakage and consumption per&#13;
connection will lead to reductions in energy costs and the costs of purchasing from&#13;
Mekoroth. No effect is assumed for materials costs because only a tiny fraction of these&#13;
costs are -currently related to the use of chemicals. The reduction in energy costs is&#13;
assumed to occur pro-rata with the reduction introduction from Municipality and Village&#13;
Council wells.&#13;
V.    Results&#13;
19.   Annex 7, Table 7.4 shows the predicted impact of the Management Contract on the income and&#13;
expenditure statement for Gaza.&#13;
20.   Annual Revenues (amount billed) are predicted to increase by US$800,000 (10%). The predicted&#13;
increase in revenue would be greater if we assumed that the conversion of illegal connections to legal&#13;
status and the installation of functioning meters had no effect on consumption.&#13;
21.   Operating costs fall from US$5.5 million p.a. to US$4.5 million p.a. as a result of increased&#13;
operating efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 7 of I5&#13;
22.   Overall, the annual excess of revenues over expenses is predicted to rise by US$1.8 million from&#13;
US$2.5 million to US$4.3 million. The reduction in accounts receivable results in operating Cash Surplus&#13;
of US$3.4 million, compared to an operating Cash Loss of US$107,000 before the Management Contract.&#13;
23.    These figures imply that the successful implementation of the Management Contract will result&#13;
in a financial position for the water and wastewater sector in Gaza which will provide strong position to&#13;
maintain the gains achieved during the four years of the Contract itself.&#13;
Part II: Methodology of Economic Analysis&#13;
A.    Social and Economic Justification&#13;
1.    This project follows and complements the ERP. It constitutes an urgent measure to quickly&#13;
improve the dismal drinking and wastewater situation in Gaza, thereby reducing health hazards and&#13;
improving economic opportunities. Economic Sector Work is planned in 1996/1997, and it is anticipated&#13;
that the water and sanitation sector will emerge as a priority for the future socio-economic development&#13;
of Gaza, and that this project will match the criteria for actions to bring about quick results in this priority&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.     The project is expected to meet its objective to improve the quantity, quality and management of&#13;
the water and wastewatersector. Specifically, and as a result of the project, it is expected that at the end&#13;
of the four-year project period: (i) the Gaza water sector will have at least 65,000 newly regularized&#13;
service connections (20,000 connections replaced; 30,000 meters replaced; and 15,000 illegal connections&#13;
converted to legal status); (ii) effective water use would increase by about 20 percent to 58 liters per&#13;
capita per day; (iii) water will be reliably disinfected throughout Gaza; and (iv) the quality of wastewater&#13;
discharges will be significantly improved.&#13;
3.    In addition, the Management Contract will improve overall water resources management in Gaza,&#13;
mainly through an increase in sector efficiency (reduction of unaccounted-for water), a reduction of&#13;
accounts receivable, improved planning and project design capacity within the municipalities and village&#13;
councils, and through implementation of a uniform, progressive tariff system throughout Gaza to&#13;
encourage water conservation and recovery of full operation and maintenance costs, as well as an&#13;
increasing portion of capital costs.&#13;
4.     The proposed project will produce social, economic, financial and environmental benefits with&#13;
regard to: (i) saved water and increased revenues by repairing and installing consumer and production&#13;
meters, leakage repairs, regularizing illegal connections, reducing the amount of accounts receivable, and&#13;
by economies of scale achieved by the consolidation of services under a single WWCG; (ii) improving&#13;
drinking and wastewater quality, consequently reducing health risks; (iii) improving service delivery,&#13;
increasing per capita availability of drinking water, and extending connections to unserved populations;&#13;
(iv) protecting the environment, particularly aquifers, from wastewater pollution; (v) creating employment&#13;
during implementation of the Service Improvement Program; and (vi) improving economic opportunities&#13;
and quality of life for the Gaza populh'ioni in general. The project would also help strengthen the PWA,&#13;
local municipal water departments and create a sustainable service delivery through the envisaged WWCG.&#13;
Finally, the project will assist the EAPC to achieve autonomy in the management of a vital resource, and&#13;
thereby contribute to the Peace Process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;

B.    Economic Benefits&#13;
5.     Many of the above benefits are not quantifiable and will have repercussions beyond the water&#13;
sector. The analysis of quantifiable benefits shows an economic rate of return (ERR) of about 14 percent,&#13;
ten years after project conclusion. This compares with an opportunity cost of about 10 percent in&#13;
countries at similar income levels (e.g., Jordan, 8.5 percent; Egypt, 11 percent).&#13;
6.     The underlying assumptions for this analysis are that: (i) the Operator will achieve maximum&#13;
sector efficiency targets (reduction in unaccounted-for water); (ii) given finite and already vastly over-&#13;
exploited water resources within Gaza, future new supplies from traditional resources will increase only&#13;
marginally; (iii) population growth, currently at 5 percent per year (mostly from refugees and&#13;
immigration), will decline and level off to about 2.8 percent in ten years; (iv) given the large unmet&#13;
municipal demand and the extreme pressure in general on water resources in the Middle East Region--&#13;
resulting in high water prices in comparable neighboring countries--the willingness to pay (WTP) is&#13;
assumed to be higher than the present highest block tariff in Gaza (US$0.67 per cubic meter), gradually&#13;
increasing over ten years to the cost of supply from desalination, by then projected at US$1.25 per cubic&#13;
meter. The paragraphs below provide details on the key assumptions.&#13;
7.     These are conservative estimates. Although achieving a sector efficiency improvement from&#13;
currently 52 percent to 70 percent in four years may appear optimistic in the Gaza context, a one-year&#13;
delay in meeting distribution network efficiency targets would only marginally affect the ERR. Other&#13;
assumptions were deliberately under-rated, given current uncertainties in Gaza. Similarly, they would have&#13;
only minor impacts on the ERR. This is explained by the large unmet municipal demand (at present close&#13;
to 100 percent of effective water use), resulting in a WTP factor which is probably significantly higher&#13;
than the highest tariff block in Gaza which is US$0.67 per cubic meter. In the West Bank, the highest&#13;
tariff block is equivalent to US$1.45 per cubic meter. In comparable countries in the Middle East, water&#13;
is purchased from vendors at prices ranging from US$3 (Lebanon) and US$5 (Jordan) per cubic meter.&#13;
8.     Water for agricultural use is currently virtually free. Tariffs are nonexistent. License fees for wells&#13;
are nominal and are often not collected. At least 1,000 out of approximately 3,000 wells are illegal. In&#13;
many cases, especially in the central area of Gaza, where water is especially scarce, farmers sell their&#13;
excess water to nearby municipalities, at prices of up to US$0.70 per cubic meter, despite nitrate&#13;
contamination and high salinity. To relieve the scarcity constraint on alternative, higher value-added&#13;
economic development, for resource conservation and equity, agriculture should give up water for the&#13;
benefit of municipal supplies. This would require that a system for charging for agricultural water will&#13;
have to be established to encourage shifting water from low-value crops to higher-value uses. Likewise,&#13;
municipal tariffs--at present on average US$0.33 per cubic meter--would have to be increased to allow&#13;
recovery of the full cost for operation and maintenance and, gradually, also capital expenditures.&#13;

10.    Water Demand Versus Supply. The current per capita municipal consumption (domestic and&#13;
industrial use) of about 70 liters per day (24 cubic meters per year)--one of the lowest in the world--is a&#13;
constraint on socio-economic growth. Based on experience in countries of similar economic development,&#13;
potential per capita municipal demand in Gaza would be at least 80 to 120 liters per day, between 33 and&#13;
44 cubic meters per year. This demand will increase, both with population growth and with economic&#13;
development. It is estimated that within the next eight to ten years, per capita demand for municipal water&#13;
will increase to about 60 cubic meters per year (Table 8.3). The savings resulting from improving&#13;
distribution network efficiency and from expected additional supplies from Israel, would increase per&#13;
capita availability of water to about 33 cubic meters per capita per year, while total per capita annual&#13;
municipal demand will be about 60 cubic meters. This would leave an enormous gap in unmet demand&#13;

11.    This project is designed to achieve quick results, in terms of improving water and sewerage&#13;
services quantitatively and qualitatively, and in strengthening the institutional capacity. It is not meant&#13;
to resolve all water sector problems. In fact, there is an enormous demand--estimated at close to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 10 of 1S&#13;
US$100 peT capita--for sector investments to rehabilitate existing installations and to expand services, over&#13;
the next three to five years. Even if these funds were available, it is uncertain whether the EAPC would&#13;
at present have the institutional and physical capacity to absorb them.&#13;
12.   Key Assumptions. The following explains the meaning of major terms used throughout this&#13;
analysis and the rationale underlying the key assumptions used to assess social and economic benefits:&#13;
(a)    Municipal Water Supply includes domestic and industrial water. In 1995, an estimated&#13;
43.0 MCM were pumped into the water supply network of the 16 municipalities and&#13;
village councils. Approximately 36.8 MCM were extracted from aquifers and 6.2 MCM&#13;
were supplied by Israel from Mekoroth. The 1995 figures were used as a basis for&#13;
estimates projected into the future. Supplies are from aquifer withdrawals and from&#13;
Israel, including an additional 5 MCM as per the September 28, 1995 Interim Agreement&#13;
(Table 8.3). They are projected to increase in parallel with population growth.&#13;
(b)    Population Growth has been extremely high in the past, among the highest in the world.&#13;
This is mostly the result of the return of refugees and immigration. For the purposes of&#13;
this analysis, it is estimated that the population growth rate would gradually decrease over&#13;
the next ten years from 6.2 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percent by 2004, declining to about&#13;
2.7 percent by 2012.2 The Gaza land area is limited and has already one of the highest&#13;
population densities in the world (less than 10 mZ per person in some refugee camps).&#13;
The territory will, thus, reach a level of saturation, both in population density and in&#13;
economic opportunities (Table 8.3).&#13;
(c)    Willingness to pay is perceived to be relatively high in Gaza, mainly as a result of the&#13;
large unmet demand and finite resources. The highest block tariff in the central villages&#13;
of Gaza is at present US$0.67 per cubic meter. The highest block tariff in the Ramallah&#13;
District of the West Bank is US$1.45 per cubic meter. Table 7.1 provides data on&#13;
average price per cubic meters consumed in each municipality and village council in&#13;
Gaza. In comparable neighboring countries the price for water from vendors (tank trucks)&#13;
is US$5 (Jordan) and US$3 (Lebanon) per cubic meter. Another comparator was GDP&#13;
in the West Bank and in Gaza. The latter is 60 percent of the former; thus, it was&#13;
assumed that given the much more acute water shortage in Gaza, the WTP in Gaza would&#13;
be about 60 percent of the highest block tariff in the West Bank, i.e., US$0.80 per cubic&#13;
meter in 1996. The WTP factor would gradually increase to reach in 2001 the projected&#13;
price of desalinated water, US$1.25 per cubic meter delivered through the distribution&#13;
network. It would then remain constant, as supplies at this price will be unlimited&#13;
(Tables 8.3 to 8.6).&#13;
(d)    Cost savings from increased operational efficiency are based on findings of the financial&#13;
analysis in Part I, estimating that at project completion the Operator would achieve&#13;
savings in operating costs of about US$1 million per year. It was assumed that these&#13;
savings would marginally increase over a ten-year period after project completion, to&#13;
reach US$2.5 million in 2009. Savings would be achieved mainly through improved&#13;
economies of scale (accounting, billing, collecting, technical design, repair workshops and&#13;

other services could be combined for the 16 communities) and streamlined operations.&#13;
This estimate may be under-rated, since it is envisaged that a regional water and sewerage&#13;
utility will be created for Gaza within the four years of the project (Tables 8.3 to 8.6) that&#13;
may achieve even greater savings.&#13;
(e)    Effective supply refers to the amount of water, net of losses, actually delivered to the user.&#13;
In Gaza in 1995, the municipal supply, as pumped into the distribution network, amounted&#13;
to 135 liters per capita per day. However, due to 48 percent unaccounted-for water&#13;
(losses), the effective supply is less than 70 liters per capita per day.&#13;

            The Water and Sanitation Services
            Project in Gaza will address urgent priorities aimed at
            improving the quality, quantity and management of water and
            wastewater services in Gaza. The project will assist the
            Executive Authority of the Palestinian Council in meeting
            urgent needs through: 1) improving water and sanitation
            services through a private sector management contract for
            water and wastewater operations; 2) strengthening and
            restructuring the institutional framework for both service
            delivery and sector governance functions; and 3) creating
            the operational, institutional and managerial conditions for
            priority rehabilitation, upgrading and extension projects to
            be financed by donors. The project will consist of the
            following components: 1) management contract fees; 2)
            operating investment; and 3) technical assistance and
            institutional capacity development.
