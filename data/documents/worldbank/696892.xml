maJor-Irrg(I)'mB09/95-16269 Dated 11th July, 1995&#13;
From:&#13;
R.N.Das,&#13;
Chief Secretary,&#13;
Government of Orissa,Bhubaneswar.&#13;
To:&#13;
Mr. Heinz Vergin,&#13;
Director, India Department,&#13;
The World Bank, Washington, D.C.&#13;
Dear Mr. Vergin,&#13;
Orissa Water Resources Proiect - Policy Reform Proaram&#13;
I am pleased to confirm the commitment of the Government of Orissa to improve management and&#13;
development of the state's water resources, as per India's National Water Policy, through enhancing&#13;
institutional capability of Orissa Department of Water Resources (D.O.W.R.).&#13;
Structural improvement in all the functional areas of D.O.W.R. will be carried out in order to enhance&#13;
efficiency of public expenditures in the water sector by establishing multi-sector water planning, requisite&#13;
prioritisation in implementation of water sector projects and providing more productive irrigation services&#13;
from the existing projects with the objective of improving agriculture productivity in the state. The State&#13;
Government is also committed to develop an efficient cost recovery mechanism, and to involve the&#13;
beneficiaries in operation and maintenance, thereby ensuring sustainability of the Irrigation systems through&#13;
adequate maintenance.&#13;
The State Government proposes to achieve the above objectives through implementation of the&#13;
Water Resources Consolidation Project, with the World Bank assistance. In this context, the Government&#13;
of Orissa has approved a Policy Reform Program as detailed in the attached matrix, which also shows the&#13;
implementa-ion schedule for completing the proposed policy reforms.&#13;
The State Government has already taken a few significant steps towards implementing the proposed&#13;
reforms, during the course of project preparation for W.R.C.P. A State Water Policy has been established&#13;
in line with the National Water Policy of 1987. State Water Resources Board has been established with&#13;
representatives of key water using Departments of the state to ensure optimal use of the state's water&#13;
resources for various uses. A standing committee has been constituted to oversee the basin planning of&#13;
water resources and environmental impact assessment. A new R&amp;R policy has been introduced in the state.&#13;
A Water Services Cost and Charges Committee has been set up by the State Government for review of&#13;
water charges on annual basis to enhance the water rates for all services in different sectors.&#13;
The State Government has also agreed in principle to reorganise the Orissa Irrigation Department,&#13;
which has been renamed as Water Resources Department, by creating specialised staff and line units for&#13;
water planning, designs, operation and maintenance and project construction. The state has decided to&#13;
adopt a policy of expenditure prioritisation in the water sector, by giving first priority to full funding of O&amp;M&#13;
of existing facilities, followed by rehabilitation and modernisation of Irrigation systems, and thereafter to&#13;
viable investments to complete ongoing schemes expeditiously.&#13;
With regards,&#13;
Attachment                                            Yours Sincerely&#13;
IR.&gt; N&#13;

STATE WATER POLICY OF ORISSA&#13;
PREAMBLE                             -&#13;
The National Water Policy of 1987 recognizes that water is a&#13;
prime natural resource and a basic need of human life. The&#13;
planning and development of water and related land resources of&#13;
the State shall be directed to improve in the quality of life as&#13;
well as contAibutions -to environmental quality.&#13;
In the State of Orissa, the principles enunciated in the&#13;
National Water Policy shall be followed. In view of the&#13;
relatively low status of water Lesources development and&#13;
majority of the population being poverty strickern, it has become&#13;
necessary to address the issues relevant to the State within the&#13;
framework of national and global water policy through a State&#13;
Water Policy.&#13;
While significant expansion of the area under irrigated&#13;
agriculture has been achieved during the past four and half&#13;
decades, further expansion of irrigation and its sustainability&#13;
would be constrained by several complex and inter-related&#13;
factors in future. The deterioration of existing irrigation&#13;
systems and the problems of waterlogging and salinization are&#13;
areas of deep concern for the water planners.&#13;
In the United Nations Water Conference hold in 1977 at&#13;
Mardel Plata,  it 'was agreed that accelerated, development and&#13;
orderly management of water resources are prerequisites in-&#13;
improving the economic and social conditions of human kind.&#13;
Specific and concerted action are required to find solutions to&#13;
various water problems and these need to be applied at national,&#13;
regional and international levels in order to ensure better&#13;
quality of life of all people in the Planet.&#13;
Tfie conference I aid down stress on sustainable development of&#13;
all sectors, which conseLrves land,  water,  plant and  animal&#13;
genetic  resources,   and  is  'environmentally  non-degrading,&#13;
technically appropriate, economically viable and socially&#13;
acceptable".&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
Within  the  broad  framework  of  the  National  Water  Plan&#13;
objectives, the specific objectives of-Ori-ssa are&#13;
(i) Development of water resources available within the&#13;
category of utilisable resource to the maximum&#13;
possible extent for economic development, especially&#13;
by efficient use of water for agriculture.&#13;
(ii) Maxinum econonic benefits through judicioius conjunctive&#13;
use of both surface and groundwater.&#13;
(iii) Judicious allocation of water resource to different&#13;
sectors with d-inking water odcupyi'ng top-priority in&#13;
order to satisfy the basic need of the. people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2&#13;
(iv)  Promotion  of  equity,  social  justice  and  balance&#13;
regional development. Special efforts should be made&#13;
to extend the benefits of water use primarily by&#13;
extending  irrigation  facilities  to  econonically&#13;
backward areas and chronically drought prone areas.&#13;
(v)  Provision  of  adequate  watez  for  drinking  and&#13;
industrial use.&#13;
(vi)   Provision   of   flood   protection   and   drainage&#13;
facilities.&#13;
(vii) Regulation of land use in flood and drainage prone&#13;
areas.&#13;
(viii)  Maintenance  of  water  quality  to  internationally&#13;
acceptable standards.&#13;
(ix) Optimization of economic benefits by multipurpose use&#13;
of water for hydropower generation.&#13;
(x) PreservAtion and enhancement of fisheries and wild life.&#13;
(xi) Provision Of social jvustice and adhquate rehabilitation&#13;
measures for persons displaced or adversely affected&#13;
by project.construction so that project affected persons&#13;
are as well or better off than that of previous situation.&#13;
(-xii)  Planning  procesRv  and  mechahisns  should  alm  at&#13;
resoldtion  of - co0n,flcts .bptveen  u.sers within  and&#13;
between inter-State river basins.&#13;
(xiii) Promotion of citizen participation in all aspects of&#13;
water planning and management.                      -&#13;
(xiv) Handing over of operation and maintenance of&#13;
irrigation systems to the users in due course.&#13;
(xv)  Eoononic,  firancial  -and  p'hysIcal  sustainability&#13;
thorough.  effective   operation,   maintenance   and&#13;
management and also based on the principle that the&#13;
beneficiaries pay for the services provided.&#13;
(Xvi) Observance of safety standards in respect of storage&#13;
dams and other water related structures.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATICN&#13;
The implementation of Orissa's Water Resources Policy will&#13;
be carried out by the Department of Water Resources (DOWR). The&#13;
Water Resources Board (WRB),  formed in October  1993,  is the&#13;
highest co-ordinating body on water planning and allocation&#13;
between   sectors   and   provides   guidance   to   the   DOWR.&#13;
Representation on the Board covers the key Water using&#13;
Departments of Government  (inter alia   secretaries  of Water&#13;
Resources,  Urban  Development,  Industry,  Rural  Development,&#13;
Agriculture, Energy, Environment, Fisheries, Panchayati Raj).&#13;
&#13;

.3&#13;
WRB will be assisted by DOWR's Water Planning Organisation (WPO)&#13;
whose Director is the Member-Secretary of the WRB.&#13;
The DOWR would make proper allocation of water to different&#13;
users and to protect water from deterioration from established&#13;
standard and upsetting ecological balance. The Government&#13;
through appropriate agencies shall provide .aeans and measures&#13;
to manage beneficially all aspects of water development' including&#13;
timely control of ground-water levels, restriction or treatment&#13;
of wastes and altered inflows, maintenance of appropriate water&#13;
quality, preservation of the environmental and ecological&#13;
balance, forecasting of supplies and_ directive of individual&#13;
project operation to meet developmental goals and policies.&#13;
Actions  needed  for  sustainable  development  of  water.&#13;
resources of the state are -&#13;
(a) Assessment of water resources&#13;
(b) Water use efficiency&#13;
(c) Environment health and pollution control&#13;
Cd) Policy, Planning and management&#13;
(e) Hazard management&#13;
(f) Public information, education, training and research&#13;
(g) Regional co-operation&#13;
The action needed for the intensification and improvement of&#13;
water development in agriculture are s--&#13;
(.a) IIrproving existing irrigation with the objectives of&#13;
raising productivity with minimum cost and delay,&#13;
improving the efficiency Sof water use and preventing&#13;
waste and degradation of water resources,&#13;
(b) Developing efficient new irrigation for further&#13;
expansion of production.&#13;
(c) Improving and extending rainfed agriculture and&#13;
improvinglive-stock production, through both better&#13;
soil moisture management and opening up of new land&#13;
through the provision of water supplies to human&#13;
settlements and live-stock.&#13;
(d) Protective agricultural land against the harmful&#13;
effects of flooding and waterlogging, and where&#13;
necessary.its reclamation;&#13;
(e) Introducing,or Expanding fish rearing in conjunction&#13;
with overall rural development activities.&#13;
(f) Scheduling irrigation supply  compatible  with  the&#13;

framework of water resources plan for the approval of the WRB.&#13;
The purpose of the plan is to assess the full water resources&#13;
development option fdr the whole State. The plan will be based&#13;
on the basin studies carried out by Water Planning Organisation&#13;
in keeping with the water policy of the State. This plan will&#13;
set the framework for future planning activities of the DOWR.&#13;
The plan will identify the needs for inter-basin transfer of&#13;
water from water surplus to water-deficit areas of the ttate.&#13;
Transfer of water from one basin to another basin is- to be&#13;
considered only after fixing the planning time horizone as the&#13;
time wherein the ultimate demand of donor basin is fully met and&#13;
zero incremental demand is attained.&#13;
MULTIPURPOSE RIVER BASIN PLAN&#13;
The DOWR apart from being the sole owner of the water&#13;
resources is also a principal user in the agriculture sector.&#13;
multipurpose river basin plans are to be prepared to guide&#13;
decisions about future water development and basin management.&#13;
The specific objective of the plan for multisectoral river&#13;
basin water development are-&#13;
(i) to assess the water resources within the basin in&#13;
light of its present and future uses;&#13;
(ii) to manage all basin water resources in a manner to&#13;
secure maximum socio-economic benefits and least&#13;
environmental   degradation   within   the   resource&#13;
constraints.  It  should  satisfy  first  of  all  the&#13;
minimum nutritional per capita requirement (NPR) in&#13;
the basin and poverty. The plan should also increase&#13;
agricultural   productivity  as  well  as  generate&#13;
employment opportunity; and.&#13;
(iii) to plan project implementation programmes in accord-&#13;
ance with legislation and regulations and on a&#13;
schedule which can meet the changing future water&#13;
needs.&#13;
The river basin plans will also include the examination of&#13;
water quality and environmental consequences of water use.&#13;
Particular attention may be given to control the groundwater&#13;
quality. The treatment of hazardous components of industrial&#13;
wastes, sewage treatment, use of fertilizers and pesticides in&#13;
agriculture and optimization of the use of water by recycling&#13;
and effluent treatment of industrial water are to be taken care&#13;
of through necessary legislation and public awareness. Water&#13;
quality  due  to  saline  water  intrusion   into   the  coastal&#13;
aquifers,  soil conservation,  afforestation measures to reduce&#13;
soil loss on the upper reaches of the river and reducing the&#13;
silting of the surface water impoundments will be considered in&#13;
the basin plan.&#13;

The flood control and drainage components shall also be&#13;
included in the basin plans in order to identify the extent and&#13;
intensity of these problems along with the necessary measures to&#13;
mitigate their effects.&#13;
On completion, each river basin plan will be submitted to&#13;
WRB for approval. These plans will serve as the basis for the&#13;
State Water Plan.&#13;
STATE WATER PLAN&#13;
The ultimate goal of the State's Water Policy is&amp;to develop&#13;
a State Water Plan which will be a blueprint for all water&#13;
development in the State. The plan should provide appropriate&#13;
use  of  water  resources  of  the State   for  drinking  water,&#13;
municipal   and   industrial   use,   power,   irrigation,   flood&#13;
mitigation, pisciculture and also recreation wherever possible.&#13;
The preservation and enhancement of the quality of environment&#13;
as well as maintenance of ecological, balance should be a prime&#13;
consideration in its formulation. This would be a dynamic plan&#13;
which would evolve overtime, incorporating new information, new&#13;
technologies, new perceptions and changing objectives and priorities. The&#13;
initial plan will be based upon the Framework Plan updated with&#13;
the Integrated River Basin Plans. The Plan should be updated and&#13;
submitted to the Water Resources Board from -time to time. The&#13;
State Plan would then serve as the official document upon which&#13;
investment portfolios and management decisions should be based.&#13;
DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
Due to the vagaries of rainfall drought are a permanent&#13;
climatic feature in Orissa. Hence, it has become necessary to&#13;
formulate Drought Management Plan for each of the river basin as&#13;
a part of the river basin plan. The plan should include-&#13;
(a).,..an integrated and comprehensive strategy for the&#13;
-management  of  land  and  water  for  sustainable&#13;
agricultural   development   under   water  scarcity&#13;
-conditions;&#13;
(b) appropriate land and water use policies and plans for&#13;
economic development of drought prone areas ensuring&#13;
that  they   remained   compatible   with   prevailing&#13;
socio-economic conditions and the environment;&#13;
(c) effective drought preparedness measures with special&#13;
emphasis on environmental protection and improving&#13;
community resilience;&#13;
(d) plans to release/regulate regenerated water flow in&#13;
rivers and drainages flowing through the irrigation&#13;
command areas for facilitating its use in the tail end&#13;
areas by recycling.&#13;
&#13;

COMPUTERISED DATABASE AND INF-ORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
The Water  Planning Organisation shall maintain a centrally&#13;
located  computerised  data  bank to store all data  relating  to&#13;
meteorology, hydrology, surface and groundwater availability,&#13;
quality, actual water use and estimated future demands for&#13;
water. T'he data will be updated from time to time and made&#13;
available to other agencies. This organisation should also have&#13;
access to the relevant data collected and stored by other state&#13;
and central agencies. This computerised databAse will play a key&#13;
role in effective water resource planning and management.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
The lack of environmental consideration in -the planning of&#13;
water resources projects may lead to severe adverse impacts&#13;
resulting in ecological damage and degradation. Environmental&#13;
management plans in respect of all likely adverse impacto  re&#13;
necessary to be prepared in advance at the planning_stage cn-dalit&#13;
should become an integral part of the master plan of the river&#13;
basin planning of the State. The environmental management'plans.&#13;
should   include    rehabilitation   measures,    afforestation,&#13;
relocation  of  historical/cultural  monuments,  relocation  of&#13;
sanctuaries and wild life habitats getting affected during the&#13;
project,   remedial   measures  to  mitigate  the  effects  of&#13;
waterlogging and salinity. Due import&gt;ce should also be given&#13;
to watershed management as an integral part of environpmental&#13;
management in order to control sediment inflows to the&#13;
reservoir.&#13;
Also the DOWR will create an Environmental Cell in Water&#13;
Planning Organisation with a view to integrating various&#13;
environmental aspects with River Basin Planning. This Cell would&#13;
also play a co-ordinating role between various Government bodies&#13;
connected. with   environmental   issues  and  it  would  also&#13;
identify/pursue sectoral and regional environmental issues&#13;
concerning Basin Planning. Regionil assessment is necessary when&#13;
a number of developmental activities are considered in localised&#13;
geographical' area whereas sectoral assessment is necessary when&#13;
multiple  projects  are  planned  in  the  same  sector.  The&#13;
Environmental Cell will also undertake studies of various water&#13;
related works for Environmental Assessment (EA) and submit&#13;
report through Water Planning Organisation on Environmental&#13;
Impact (EI) to WIRB for review and approval.&#13;
Another unit of Environmental Cell may be created under&#13;
DOWR's  Ptoject  Forrnulation  Directorate  which  will  tackle&#13;
project/Sub-projectgpif~cific Environmental Assessment '(EA)  for&#13;
water   resources   projects.   It   will   formulate   specific&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) assistance for all new projects&#13;
and  give    guidelines   for  inter-agency  co-ordination  for&#13;
environmental clearance of projects.&#13;
FLOOD AND DRAItNAGE MANAGEMENT -&#13;
FLOOD MANAGEMENT&#13;
The scientific control and utilisation of flood water is an&#13;
essential part of water resources. development planning. Flood&#13;
management is divided in two parts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14-                 Annex 2&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
7&#13;
(i) mitigation of flood damages;&#13;
(ii) utilisation of flood water for beneficial uses.&#13;
Flood control measures are mainly of two types, namely,&#13;
structural and non-structural. Structural measures include&#13;
reservoirs, embankments, levees, channel improvement, etc. Non-&#13;
structural  measures  include  flood  plain  zoning,  watershed&#13;
management, flood forecasting and flood warning.&#13;
DRAINAGE MANAGEMENT&#13;
Drainage of surplus water from-waterlogged areas and other&#13;
stagnant, water bodies is a major problem in river basin&#13;
planning. Waterlogging is detrimental to crop production and&#13;
leads to salinization of soiis, which renders them unfit for&#13;
cultivation.  Sustained waterlogging *salsoanenvironmental and&#13;
health hazard. Hence, proper preventive and remedial measures&#13;
are necessary and they should be  incorporated in the River&#13;
Basin Master Plan. It should indicate appropriate preventive&#13;
measures in areas where such conditions have not yet developed.&#13;
Lining of water distribution system, efficient on-farm water&#13;
management, proper maintenance of surface drainage system and&#13;
conjunctive use of surface and groundwater can also reduce the&#13;
drainage problem to a great extent.&#13;
Proper irrigation scheouling should be resorted to as far as&#13;
possible for controlling waterloqging in the command areas.&#13;
The DOWR should formulate suitable Flood and Drainage plan&#13;
for each basin.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Reorganization And Strengthening&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     Based on an Institutional Study undertaken by DOWR (formerly known as the Orissa&#13;
Irrigation Department1) as part of its preparation for the WRCP, the decision has been taken by&#13;
GOO to fundamentally restructure the department into a specialized state water agency. The new&#13;
organizational structure of DOWR is contained in the organization charts attached to this annex.&#13;
Figure 1 contains the overall structure, with detailing by sub-unit in the subsequent Figures.&#13;
2.      The overall objectives of the reorganization are to:&#13;
e broaden DOWR's responsibilities to include technical responsibility for basin planning,&#13;
and create a state Water Resources Board for multi-sectoral decisions regarding water&#13;
planning and allocation;&#13;
-   create functionally specialized line units for each key functional responsibility of the&#13;
new DOWR (water planning, project planning and formulation, design and research,&#13;
water services (i.e. O&amp;M), hydrometry, etc.);&#13;
*   create specialized corporate management and personnel management/training&#13;
capabilities (management information systems, programming and budgeting,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, procurement, public information, personnel management,&#13;
and training);&#13;
*   decentralize management along river basin lines including substantial transfer of&#13;
decision making to field managers (field activities would now be implemented under&#13;
four basin region managers at Chief Engineer level); and&#13;
*   create institutional capability for implementing water sector related R&amp;R and&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
'IThe Orissa Irrigation Department (OID), renamed as Departmnent of Water Resources (DOWR) in March 1994, has been the&#13;
lead agency for water resources development in the state, responsible for planning, developing and managing the states water&#13;
resources for irrigation, bulk water supply, drinage and flood control, with direct responsibility for implementation of Major&#13;
and Medium Irigation projects, and their operation and maintenance. Implementation of Minor irrigation schemes and their&#13;
operation and maintenance as well as Ground Water exploitation has been the responsibility of the Rural Development&#13;
Department, though the staff belongs to the cadre of Irrigation Department. Command Area Development (CAD) Department&#13;
of the State has been responsible for multi-disciplinary activities of irrigated agriculture in the selected command areas, below&#13;
the outlet. Water resource development for Hydro-power is the responsibility of the State Energy Department The&#13;
government owned Orissa Construction Corporation (OCC) carries out major works like tunneling, barrages and manufacture&#13;
of gates as a public sector agency. Water and Land Management Ilstitute (WALMI) provides irrigation sector tsining to&#13;
officers and staff of irrigation department and also to some extent of agriculture department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
This reorganization, currently underway2, will be accompanied by strengthening of capabilities in&#13;
all management units of the new DOWR through provision of staff training, consultancy&#13;
assistance, and appropriate equipment, vehicles and facilities. Requirements by management unit&#13;
are contained in the cost tables at Annex 18.&#13;
Need for Institutional Reform&#13;
3.     The present organizational structure of OID/DOWR has numerous lines of authority and&#13;
it's functional capabilities are diffused throughout the organization with overlapping technical and&#13;
geographical jurisdictions: e.g. eight Chief Engineers have both construction and maintenance&#13;
responsibilities with no specific unit for setting standards and monitoring program performance.&#13;
Because of the frequent transfers of technical personnel without regard to functional expertise&#13;
there is marked lack of specialization to meet the challenges of a technological world. A&#13;
comprehensive institutional study was conducted by OID with assistance from consultants from&#13;
the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC) of Australia, and local advisors in&#13;
administration with Indian experience. The study, which was completed in October 1993,&#13;
concluded that "the department's present institutional arrangements can not adequately embrace&#13;
modem management requirements which include devolution of decision making authority to the&#13;
lowest possible level, personnel development, specialization and career structure for all staff'.&#13;
Elements of Reorganized Institutional Structure of DOWR&#13;
4.     DOWR will continue to be responsible for planning, developing and managing the state's&#13;
water resources for irrigation, bulk water supply, drainage and flood control, with direct&#13;
responsibility for construction, operation and management of major and medium irrigation&#13;
projects. The DOWR will have an expanded role of: (i) advising the newly formed Water&#13;
Resources Board; (ii) developing and maintaining a state water plan; (iii) involving farmers in&#13;
irrigation system operation and maintenance decisions; (iv) turning over certain responsibilities of&#13;
O&amp;M of irrigation systems to farmers; (v) strengthening environmental management; (vi)&#13;
managing a new resettlement and economic rehabilitation structure for project affected persons;&#13;
and (vii) maintaining a State Water Resources Data Center.&#13;
5.     The reorganization will be implemented through redeployment of the existing staff to new&#13;
defined positions, with minimal fresh recruitment. New recruitment will be limited to a few&#13;
specialist disciplines where staff expertise is currently not available or in insufficient numbers.&#13;
Principally, this is in the areas of R&amp;R, environment, and basin planning. Discrete needs for&#13;
individuals in such areas as economics, programming and budgeting, computer related skills and&#13;
other areas as needed would also be filled. Staff relocation, and the subsequent drive to create the&#13;
necessary specialized skills, will require a major training program, fully costed under the project.&#13;
2 The reorganization is ongoing, and in terms of departmental restructuring was largely completed by August/September 1995.&#13;
Actions already completed include: (i) broadening the mandate and responsibilities of DOWR to include planning for all uses&#13;
of water; (ii) creation of the Water Resources Board (Nov. 1993); (iii) creation of the R&amp;R Directorate (Mar. 1994), and (iv)&#13;
designation, in advance of the formal restructuring, of task heads for the major functional activities of DOWR. Issuance of&#13;
Govenment Orders putting into effect the remaining organizational details of DOWR following the organlization charts&#13;
attached, was completed, as well as posting of key staff, prior to negotiations.&#13;
&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Pricing and Cost Recovery of Water Services&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Orissa Department of Water Resources (DOWR) provides water services within the&#13;
state of Orissa. These services include water supplied for irrigation, urban domestic users, rural&#13;
villages, industry, power stations and commercial users, drainage services to farmers and rural&#13;
communities, and flood control along major rivers. At present, cost recovery for all services is&#13;
significantly less than the cost of provision.&#13;
Government Objectives&#13;
2.    The Government of Orissa (GOO) has a stated policy to recover the cost of O&amp;M of&#13;
water services from the beneficiaries over the five year period 1995 to 2000. This will entail an&#13;
annual review and progressive annual adjustments of water service fees over the five-year period.&#13;
Full cost recovery of O&amp;M, thereafter, will be continued over the remaining OWRCP period and&#13;
beyond. While possibilities may be available for increasing the service fees for non-agricultural&#13;
users, as irrigation is the largest user, increased fees for this service will be an essential and&#13;
primary component of the annual adjustments of water service fees. To achieve the above&#13;
objectives a multi-faceted approach will be used:&#13;
(a)   An Institutional Structure and analytical apparatus will be established for assessing&#13;
service costs and fees, making annual recommendations on adjustments and&#13;
reviewing such recommendations;&#13;
(b)   A Public Information and Awareness Strategy will be fostered including&#13;
publication of disaggregated service costs and fees, sharing of information with the&#13;
general public and customers, particularly farmers at the command level, and&#13;
involvement of irrigation commands, Apex Committees, and Farmer Councils, and&#13;
other user groups in decisions on irrigation and other water services management&#13;
and expenditures;&#13;
(c)   Service Oualitv. Cost and Management:&#13;
(i)    Ouality of service will be improved through better management of&#13;
maintenance and full funding of maintenance works; rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of irrigation systems associated with farmer participation&#13;
through the Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover Component&#13;
(SIFT); and Scheme Completions entailing conversion from rainfed to&#13;
irrigated agriculture; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
(ii)    Cost of services of each irrigation (or other water supply) facility will be&#13;
carefully monitored, and data and recommendations shared annually with&#13;
command-level Apex Committees or other user group representatives (e.g.,&#13;
municipalities). Opportunities for savings, improved quality and efficiency&#13;
will be identified and implemented (e.g., staff savings, handling of some&#13;
tasks by farmers, etc.); and&#13;
(iii)    Participatory management under the SIFT component of areas below the&#13;
distributary would be progressively turned over to Farmer Councils for&#13;
O&amp;M. Apex Committees would be formed as peak bodies to advise&#13;
DOWR management.&#13;
Cost Model Development for Water Pricing and Cost Recovery&#13;
3.    A consultant-assisted study has produced computerized cost models that give guidance to&#13;
GOO and DOWR on allocating costs to the various service categories (e.g., irrigation, drainage,&#13;
flood control, bulk water to municipalities and power plants) and the assessment of charges to be&#13;
levied on each of the service categories. The models allow for incorporation of current charges&#13;
and revenues from each service category, plus government contribution for services considered a&#13;
public good (e.g., flood protection, drainage, and wastewater disposal). The result is the&#13;
identification of the gap between current and required revenue to meet the overall cost recovery&#13;
objectives and the rates to be struck for various services.&#13;
Basis of Cost Model&#13;
4.    The process followed in developing the cost recovery model was, first, to identify&#13;
categories of service provided by DOWR, then to quantify the service, either in terms of the&#13;
annual volume of water provided to each class of beneficiary, or the area benefited by drainage or&#13;
flood control (Table 1). Expenditure categories were then determined with O&amp;M (non-plan)&#13;
expenditures dominating. Other expenditure may in the future, include investment (plan)&#13;
expenditure, debt, and emergency reserves. However, only the non-plan expenditure was&#13;
allocated in this exercise and this will allow the primary objective to be met. In most cases&#13;
activities are common to a number of users, such as major canals servicing many farmers as well&#13;
as municipalities. Taking note of these factors, the costs incurred by DOWR were allocated&#13;
appropriately among all services provided (Table 2).&#13;
5.    The two factors (cost and quantity) provide an indication of the unit cost of the particular&#13;
service. The final step in defining the allocation of the costs incorporated the quality of service as&#13;
well as some customer groups' ability to pay. The primary factor in this assessment is reliability of&#13;
supply. During periods of severe scarcity, priority services are provided to drinking water,&#13;
industry and power plants, and some commercial users. This in turn requires a reduction in the&#13;
diversions of irrigation supplies. Further, during annual periods of canal closures (for irrigation)&#13;
the system is run periodically so as to meet the needs of non-agricultural users. An assessment of&#13;
the above factors resulted in the determination of a rate factor for some services.&#13;

6.    Three example model runs have been performed to demonstrate the versatility of the cost&#13;
model. The runs are detailed in the attachments and show the following:&#13;
(a)    Run I (Table 3) is a straight calculation of what rates would have to be for full&#13;
cost recovery of the current expenditure which amounts to about 288 Rs/ha. The&#13;
assessed revenue would be Rs 179.02 millions from direct beneficiaries or an&#13;
equivalent 300 Rs/ha. This model run uses existing tariff rates not including&#13;
recently approved increases for urban and industrial bulk water charges. The effect&#13;
is to increase charges for irrigation water in both the khariff and rabi seasons by a&#13;
large 229 percent and 208 percent respectively.&#13;
(b)   Run 2 (Table 4) is a similar calculation aiming to raise enough revenue to cover&#13;
existing costs only, but the new rates for urban and industrial water have been&#13;
incorporated. The total revenue raised is Rs 175.66 millions or 294 Rs/ha&#13;
equivalent. The effect of raising urban and industrial charges is to increase revenue&#13;
from bulk water sales by 246 percent (Rs 38 to 131.6 millions) over model Run 1.&#13;
This run leaves irrigation rates unchanged.&#13;
(c)    Run 3 (Table 5) is a calculation based on the requirement to raise revenue&#13;
equivalent to 418 Rs/ha which is the assessed need for efficient and effective O&amp;M&#13;
of the water supply systems. The calculation uses the new rates for urban and&#13;
industrial services and further increases under this model run come from raising the&#13;
rates for irrigation water services by 121 percent for khariff and 127 percent for&#13;
rabi seasons respectively.&#13;
7.    Revenues from other government services (flood control, storm water and agricultural&#13;
drainage, and wastewater disposal ) would be collected by relevant Departments, and the DOWR&#13;
reimbursed for the service provided. Revenue from these services is estimated at Rs 19.4 million.&#13;
8.    Water charges for irrigation will be progressively raised from the present levels (which&#13;
yield about Rs 44 million in revenue) to ultimately cover the shortfall in revenue between receipts&#13;
from the above charges, and the cost of providing irrigation services. On average the real&#13;
increase would be approximately 124 percent but would, of course, be dependent upon receipts&#13;
from other sources. Further, irrigation water rates would depend on the cost of O&amp;M, which&#13;
may be reduced by increasing the efficiency of activities and other cost saving measures including&#13;
the handing over to farmers of downstream parts of the system.&#13;
9.    Significant progress has been made by GOO during OWRCP preparation in cost recovery&#13;
analysis and implementation. As outlined above, GOO has already undertaken a first set of&#13;
implementation actions. These include the raising in 1994 of the industrial rate fourten times to&#13;
fully recovery costs associated with industrial water, taking into account the higher level of&#13;
security of supply and benefits that accrue to industry. Rates have also been raised five-fold for&#13;
bulk supply to municipalities and 20-fold to the construction industry. In addition, GOO has&#13;
committed to fully recover O&amp;M costs by the year 2000 in five annual steps. In accordance with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -                            Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
the analysis, this would require a doubling of irrigation rates to achieve revenue in the amount of&#13;
Rs. 418 /ha, which is the assessed average cost of O&amp;M. Of this amount, Rs. 200 /ha is the&#13;
assessed requirement for maintenance works. The balance would fund establishment and&#13;
maintenance of management information systems. The maintenance works funding side has&#13;
already been addressed through progressively stepped-up funding levels for works over the past&#13;
two years. For 1995/96, the allocation for maintenance works funding was set at Rs. 229/ha&#13;
(main report para. 2.41).&#13;
10.   In bridging the revenue gap, an option is for DOWR to move the cost of service at&#13;
different rates to the point of full cost recovery based on the factors outlined above. For instance,&#13;
new areas developed progressively under scheme completions should immediately attract the full&#13;
price. Most areas under completions will not come into service until well into the implementation&#13;
period of the project, and there is strong argument to support full charge of service provision,&#13;
taking into account the farmer's adoption rates of on-farm irrigation practices. (It is recognized&#13;
that a major communication and extension effort would be required during the transition period&#13;
from rainfed to irrigated agriculture.) For schemes included for rehabilitation and modernization,&#13;
the move from current rates to full charges might involve price increases at the same rate as under&#13;
the project until rehabilitation is complete. Subsequently, the rate for rehabilitated scheme areas&#13;
would be fast tracked to full cost in the first full year after works completion. For the group of&#13;
irrigators that are outside the OWRCP the increase to full cost would be more gradual. Options&#13;
based on other factors will also be considered by DOWR and the Water Rates Costs Recovery&#13;
Committee (WRCRC).&#13;
Institutional Arrangements - Water Rates Costs Recovery Committee&#13;
11.   An important contributing factor to inadequate cost recovery has been the absence of any&#13;
mechanism or responsible party to annually review and make recommendations to goverrnent on&#13;
service costs and fees. The GOO recently formed the Water Rates Costs Recovery Committee&#13;
(WRCRC) with the primary objective of acting as the institutional body for the setting and annual&#13;
review of water charges. The committee reports to the Water Resources Board, and the&#13;
designated chairman of the WRCRC is the EIC DOWR. Committee membership comprises CE&#13;
Water Services, heads of various Departments including Finance, Revenue, Agriculture, Energy,&#13;
Industries, Urban and Rural Development. The Committee would be constituted is a permanent&#13;
body with a small compliment of staff and invested with a budget allowing for procurement of&#13;
consultancy services as needed (such as for financial analysis and management, communications,&#13;
or economic analysis). The committee would be strengthened by the addition of a full time&#13;
economist, for whom consultancy assistance could be provided as needed. Such consultancy&#13;
support would be funded under the Technical Assistance component of the OWRCP during the&#13;
life of the project, as would the costs of an additional short-term consultant in PYI to strengthen&#13;
economic analysis capabilities.&#13;
Communication of Water Pricing Strategy of Government&#13;
12.   An important element of the water pricing and cost recovery process will be to&#13;
communicate to customers, staff, and local politicians the pricing and cost recovery strategies and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 2 -                            Annex 4&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
decisions once they have been agreed to at government level. There will be resistance from&#13;
farmers directly and through political representation, but much resistance would be averted or at&#13;
least significantly reduced if the process was transparent and involved farmers and other direct&#13;
beneficiaries in a full and frank disclosure. T he reasons for a move to full cost recovery and the&#13;
benefits of sustained water systems need to be clearly articulated to all the stakeholders including&#13;
the staff, and data and all decisions will be shared, discussed with and involve the participants.&#13;
Service Quality. Cost and Management&#13;
13.   In order to meet the objective of full cost recovery it will be necessary to develop for all&#13;
service categories, the cost of provision and the tariff structures for each. Steps are already being&#13;
taken to differentially price services across categories on the basis of cost of provision as well as&#13;
the relative levels of security enjoyed by the municipal and industrial customers. Following on&#13;
from the work already done by the DOWR and the consultant, differential pricing of services will&#13;
be refined further and opportunities for other revenue from new sources will be explored.&#13;
14.   The dominant water service provided by DOWR is for irrigation. To bridge the gap&#13;
between current revenue and full O&amp;M costs, the bulk of additional revenue must come from this&#13;
service category. The quantum of increase in water charges for this service shall be decided in the&#13;
WRCRC's annual recommendations taking into account a number of interrelated factors including&#13;
the relative improvements in the quality of service provided in the SIFT areas and under the&#13;
Scheme Completions component. Account will also be taken of the change in the levels of&#13;
responsibility for the lower end of schemes taken over by farmers for the management of O&amp;M,&#13;
thus reducing the financial liability of DOWR.&#13;
Revenue Collections - Transfer to DOWR&#13;
15.   Under the OWRCP, DOWR will develop a new emphasis on the closer management of&#13;
water supply schemes for the provision of high quality services. In doing this the organization&#13;
will move closer to its main customer group, the farmers. This move will be assisted by the&#13;
transfer of the rate collection function to the Department. This will link the service provider and&#13;
the payment by irrigators for the services received. It will serve to strengthen the relationship&#13;
between the organization and its core customer group and at the same time instill a greater level&#13;
of accountability for the quality of services provided. At the same time Departmental&#13;
management focus is moving downward toward the farmers, the involvement of farmers at&#13;
Farmer Council and Apex Committee levels is moving participatory management upwards. The&#13;
interrelationship between the Department and the irrigators is obvious. However, in resourcing&#13;
the revenue collection function it will be important to put in place an efficient revenue process,&#13;
taking into account staffing levels, the application of computer billing systems for customer&#13;
property and cropping data, increased mobility for revenue staff, or using some of the existing&#13;
collection process under the Finance Department. In the end, the customers will demand and&#13;
deserve a cost-effective process.&#13;
16.   Collection by Farmers and Incentives. Farmer Councils would be given incentives to&#13;
collect fees on behalf of the Department in the form of discounts ranging in proportion to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 3 -                            Annex 4&#13;

collection rates achieved (e.g., 18 percent retained if 100 percent collected, 12 percent retained if&#13;
95 percent collected, 5 percent retained if 90 percent collected).&#13;
Participatory Management - Involvement of Farmers&#13;
17.   Farmer Councils will be formed at distributary level and below, and Apex Committees&#13;
would be formed as umbrella organizations made up of a number of Farmer Councils. These&#13;
Committees would have an advisory function at medium scheme level; would advise on customer&#13;
satisfaction through review of system operational performance; the adequacy of maintenance&#13;
programs; the overall unit cost of service provision through budget review; and the price of&#13;
services and overall cost recovery performance. The Committees would also be a strong liaison&#13;
between canal command area managers and farmers. Ultimately, water will be supplied on a&#13;
volumetric basis in bulk at the head of Council areas. Councils would then collect fees from&#13;
farmers within their areas to cover both the O&amp;M costs of infrastructure below the distributary&#13;
level, and the cost of bulk water supply from DOWR.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Water Planning&#13;
General&#13;
i1. The OWRCP's water planning objectives are to establish an institutional apparatus for&#13;
basin and state multi-sectoral water planning, build up technical expertise in this area, and&#13;
implement during the project period the preparation of detailed multi-sectoral basin plans and a&#13;
state water plan. These initiatives needed to be situated within a supportive State Water Policy&#13;
(issued in 1994 - Annex 2). Water planning was also a central feature in DOWR's institutional&#13;
reform described in Annex 3. Key actions and decisions related to water and land planning taken&#13;
during project preparation included:&#13;
*     iEstablishment of a Water Resources Board (ORB) headed by the Chief Secretary, State&#13;
of Orissa, a body created to ensure inter-departmental coordination of a wide spectrum of&#13;
other departments within the state that are involved in water planning and development&#13;
processes.&#13;
*     Establishment of the Orissa Water Planning Office (OWPO) in DOWR headed by a Chief&#13;
Engineer, to be the nodal unit responsible for all phases of multi-sectoral basin planning.&#13;
Designation of OWPO as the Secretariat to the WRB.&#13;
*     Establishment of two Environmental Cells of which one is under CE-OWPO (for macro &amp;&#13;
basin planning) and one under CE (project) Planning and Formulation (project level&#13;
environmental assessments).&#13;
*     Establishment of the Orissa Water Resources Data Center (WRDC) with provision for a&#13;
greatly improved water resources data base (both quantitatively and qualitatively). The&#13;
WRDC is to be funded under Orissa's component of the (IDA funded) Hydrology Project&#13;
(FY 96) which will be implemented in parallel with the OWRCP.&#13;
*     Establishment of comprehensive Training and Technical Assistance components directly&#13;
applicable to basin-wide and project specific planning.&#13;
These policy and institutional actions have been paralleled by progressive build-up, through&#13;
training and consultancy, of OWPO staff capabilities. This has included a technical assistance&#13;
contract with international consultants (Euroconsult/Delft Hydraulics). As a result of these&#13;
various actions, the institutional and policy basis for the component is already established and the&#13;
technical work of basin planning is well underway, as described below.&#13;
2.    The DOWR's approach in attaining the goal of a fully functional integrated State Water&#13;
Plan by year 2002 has been to divide the State into four major hydrographic basin-regions,&#13;
comprising one or more river basins and sub-basins, and linking those basins organizationally and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

administratively within the Department in accordance with its overall responsibilities for water&#13;
resources conservation and development. For basis planning purposes, these basin regions are&#13;
further subdivided into eleven physiographic river basin locations (refer to map in the main&#13;
report). Administrative groupings under the four regions are as follows:&#13;
I     Kolab, Vansadhara, Nagavali, Indravati and Bahuda&#13;
II.    Lower Mahanadi and Rushikulya&#13;
III.   Upper Mahanadi&#13;
IV.   Brahmani, Baitarani, Subarnarekha and Budhabalanga&#13;
OWPO's organizational structure of OWPO is shown on page 9 of Attachment 1 of Annex 3. Its&#13;
situation within DOWR's overall structure is shown on page I of that attachment.&#13;
Orissa Water Planning Organization&#13;
3.    The OWPO will be the nodal agency in preparing River Basin Plans within the State. Its&#13;
basin planning responsibilities are strengthened by designation of its CE as Secretary to the WRB&#13;
(headed by the Chief Secretary) assuring efficient interdepartmental coordination of future State&#13;
Water Planning activities. In the development of its basin planning strategies, DOWR has&#13;
adopted the general guidelines of the OWPO "Guidelines for the Preparation of River Basin&#13;
Master Plan" dated April 1990. In some respects, existing OWPO staff are well prepared for&#13;
undertaking computer based mathematical simulations of hydrology and physiographic conditions&#13;
as are necessary for carrying out River Basin Plans. Various computer based planning initiatives&#13;
have been or are being undertaken with the assistance of international consultants. In addition,&#13;
the DOWR has participated in past exercises such as: in cooperation with CWPRS, Pune,&#13;
physical modeling of part of the Mahanadi River delta; and, through more recent efforts under&#13;
OWPO, initiation with Euroconsult of a comprehensive mathematical basin planning model of the&#13;
Mahanadi River and Tributary systems. Thus, within DOWR a nucleus of modeling awareness&#13;
has been created, including OWPO's specialized introduction to computer driven practice.&#13;
Nevertheless, comprehensive upgrading of these highly skilled disciplines through expansion of&#13;
staff and its capabilities involving state-of-the-art modeling techniques will be necessary.&#13;
Provision, under the WRCP, will be made for new building accommodations equipped with&#13;
modem computer-based hard and software including Geographic Information System (GIS),&#13;
remote sensing, additional mathematical and basin planning models, as well as installation of&#13;
laboratory for testing and evaluating water quality samples in support of basin planning.&#13;
Significant training and technical assistance will also be provided under the WRCP.&#13;
4.    Planning Approach. The basic approach to basin planning will be to develop a conformed&#13;
water and land resources data base and, using modem basin planning techniques and modeling&#13;
capabilities, compare and analyze total water availability in each hydrological unit (catchment&#13;
area) with current and future requirements. When planning is perfected through advancing stages&#13;
of achievement and input, the basin catchment models comprising the State Water Plan will&#13;
become a reliable and useful tool with which to guide and improve the states' water and related&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

land utilization decisions of the future. The process will be one of evolving utility of such&#13;
capabilities over time and will require skilled maintenance and upgrading of capabilities as the data&#13;
base increases and improves qualitatively. The data base will include both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative aspects of water resources data (stream flow, groundwater, rainfall, climate, solar&#13;
radiation, etc.) and related land use data (physiographic, vegetation, agricultural, urban, industrial&#13;
and other uses). These data will be needed to determine the balance between availability and&#13;
demand (present and future, and their spatial distribution within each physiographic basin area.)&#13;
Shortages and surpluses in quantitative terms will thus be monitored and trends established that&#13;
will be useful in guiding water policies and practices along with consideration of social, economic&#13;
and environmental impacts. Accordingly, availability of water resources for multiple use purposes&#13;
would be determined under current conditions and under future conditions of development&#13;
including (a) transfer of water from areas of excess to areas of shortage for use in irrigation,&#13;
urban, industrial, power generation or other purposes, and (b) for satisfying the priorities among&#13;
potential functional users, i.e., irrigation, domestic/urban, and industrial water supply, electric&#13;
power generation, fisheries and wildlife conservation, minimum low flows for pollution controls,&#13;
etc.&#13;
5.    Rapid advancement of OWPO capabilities has been emphasized from the beginning of&#13;
WRCP preparations. Preliminary basin studies for five river basins covering 70% of the state&#13;
have already been completed. It will be important that the momentum already established is&#13;
carried forward and further accelerated during OWRCP implementation. Established basin and&#13;
state water planning would be the cornerstone for a new generation of improvements and&#13;
advances in Orissa's water resources management practices. The importance of this planning&#13;
exercise in the State's ability to fulfill and sustain the requirements of further generations cannot&#13;
be overstated.&#13;
6.    Implementation. All eleven basins, covering the entire State, will be studied. These will&#13;
be reported in a multi-phased progression of increasingly detailed studies leading to an Integrated&#13;
River Basin Plan (State Water Plan) by year 2002. The approach and terrminology adopted by&#13;
OWPO in delivering the integrated State Water Plan comprise four "Study Spirals" (or levels of&#13;
achievement). Finalization of the Fourth Spiral will culminate with the proposed State Water&#13;
Plan. Broad objectives for each spiral are:&#13;
* The First Spiral study involves the initial identification of all available water and related land&#13;
resources as well as existing and planned uses in each of the State's 11 basins. First spiral&#13;
studies of four of these basins including Baitarani, Mahanadi, Brahmani and Rushikulya, have&#13;
been completed to initially adopted standards.&#13;
* The Second Spiral generally would include a second, more detailed screening of resources and&#13;
demands including more attention to their spatial distribution within each basin and would&#13;
include environmental modeling analyses.&#13;
* The Third Spiral would include a more detailed or final river basin study with application of&#13;
enhanced computer technologies for the evaluation of water availability in context of special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
demands including present and projected long-term future demands, consumptive uses, and&#13;
water quality, demographics, land use, etc. considerations.&#13;
* The Fourth Spiral would integrate the Third Spiral or Final Basin Plans for the 1  basins, as&#13;
appropriate, into the State Water Plan which will include an array of development and&#13;
conservation options leading to individual project selections, and policy decisions. This would&#13;
provide the continuing bases for studying and rationalizing possible solutions to issues of&#13;
intra- and inter-basin importance including current water availability (time-wise and spatially)&#13;
and related utilization priorities.&#13;
7.    The Integrated State Water Plan, or Fourth Spiral, is scheduled for completion in year&#13;
2002 inclusive of the completion of Master Plans at Sub-basin, Block and Village levels.&#13;
Thereafter, the upgrading of the Integrated State Water Plan would be a continuous process&#13;
involving new resources data and development and conservation issues as they arise.&#13;
Framework State Water Plan.&#13;
8.    In order to have a broad framework for development planning of the state's water and&#13;
land resources as early as possible, the Integrated State Water Plan would be preceded by a&#13;
Framewo,: State Water Plan prepared by end PYI (March 31, 1997). Most first spirals&#13;
(covering about 90% of the state's area and some second spiral basin plans would be completed&#13;
by then, providing a good basis for an interim assessment. The Framework State Water Plan&#13;
would summarize the results of the first spirals and provide broad guidance and early conclusions&#13;
about potential future resource-based development potentials.&#13;
9.    Other features in the exercises above include the following. The "Second Spiral" would&#13;
include economic screening of potential projects and specific alternatives based on pre-feasibility&#13;
cost estimates prepared by the CE-Plan Formulation (CE-PF). (OWPO would do the benefit&#13;
assessments and ERR, etc.) Initial plans at "Second Spiral" would be based on computerized&#13;
simulations and operational hydrology studies. The "Third Spiral" would include complex aspects&#13;
of environmental modeling and economic assessment of disadvantages and externalities and&#13;
mitigation proposals and costs. Initial multi-objective/multi-attribute selection criteria would be&#13;
applied at this stage. Selected development projects would then be sent to CE-PF for feasibility&#13;
study.&#13;
10.   A variety of DOWR activities will interlink with OWPO's basin planning work. In&#13;
particular, these include the work of project formulation, hydrological data collection and&#13;
environmental analysis and are described below.&#13;
11.   Project Formulation. The CE-PF, DOWR, would be responsible for individual water&#13;
resource project date management, investigations and planning including the range of activities&#13;
required from preliminary site assessment based on socio-economic feasibility criteria and&#13;
evaluation. Feasibility level layouts and designs and formulation of project functions and size, etc.&#13;
economic aspects of development and preparation of appropriate reports for management would&#13;
be a major task under the CE-PF. The Plan Formulation Directorate would also be charged with&#13;
the preparation of reconnaissance or pre-feasibility level cost estimates for screening of project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
alternatives identified for initial consideration in formulation of Basin Plans by OWPO. The CE-&#13;
PF would also be responsible for administering an Environmental Cell that would participate filly&#13;
in project-level planning under the CE-PF and, also, perform environmental assessments and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation tasks related to programs of DOWR's Design-Research and&#13;
Construction, and Water Services (i.e. O&amp;M) Directorates. The CE-PF would also establish and&#13;
revise project planning criteria in compliance with GOI standards with emphasis on Orissa&#13;
conditions.&#13;
12.   Water Resource Data Improvements. The establishment of the Orissa Water Resources&#13;
Data Center (WRDC), to be housed on the OWPO's proposed new building facility, is being&#13;
financed under the Bank assisted Hydrology Project (FY96). This action will add significantly to&#13;
the quantity and quality of the State's and GOI's surface and sub-surface water resources data&#13;
base. The WRDC will: (i) initiate, set and maintain data collection, verification, dissemination&#13;
and reporting standards in accordance with National norms; (ii) collect, verify and publish surface&#13;
water and meteorological data; (iii) establish a computerized data bank; (iv) upgrade&#13;
arrangements for data collection of reservoir operations and river diversions and levels and return&#13;
flows from surface water diversions and ground water withdrawals and incorporate such data into&#13;
National, regional and the state data banks; (v) report useful data to the National Surface Water&#13;
Resources Data Center, and, procure groundwater data from the Ground Water Data Centers of&#13;
the Rural Development Department and make these data available to DOWR organization users&#13;
such as the OWPO and other users in the State. In addition, the WRDC will establish Basin&#13;
Water Resources Data Collection Units to install and maintain collection sites, record the site&#13;
data, make meteorological observations, collect water quality samples, and, in some cases,&#13;
accomplish laboratory testing of water quality samples.&#13;
13.   Environmental Assessment of River Basins. River Basin planning capabilities have also&#13;
been enhanced by the creation of an Environmental Cell within the OWPO. The objective of&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) in river basins would be to integrate environmental&#13;
considerations fully with water development planning, basin management and project design&#13;
selection and approval. The EA will provide an overview of environmental aspects of review and&#13;
diagnostics of water related issues in the state. It will also present problems, issues and trends,&#13;
causative factors and possible remedies including brief overview of institutions involved in water&#13;
related environmental matters (water planning, implementation of projects, monitoring,&#13;
regulatory, legislative, pricing, and examine the interlinkages between such institutions. The main&#13;
functions, responsibilities and tasks of the OWPO's Environmental Cell are:&#13;
*     Identify and prioritize projects for development, including consideration of environmental&#13;
and water allocation constraints and mitigating measures such as downstream pollution&#13;
assimilation.&#13;
*     Set-up and operate an Enviromnental Data base management System (EDBMS) including&#13;
Reference Library.&#13;
*     Research applicable environmental assessment legislation, legal obligation, and EA&#13;
techniques on behalf of DOWR.&#13;
&#13;

*     Prepare environmental overviews and assessments as integral inputs to river basin and sub-&#13;
basin plans.&#13;
*     Advise DOWR senior management and WRB on environmental legislation, water&#13;
conservation and environmental awareness policy and programs relevant to sectoral water&#13;
resource interests.&#13;
*     Prepare EA guidelines applicable to, and departmental procedures for, EAs for river basin&#13;
planning and EAs for specific projects to be submitted for formal evaluation by state and&#13;
federal authorities.&#13;
*     Prepare EA Terms of Reference for priority projects for implementation by project&#13;
formulation and planning Directorate.&#13;
*     Research and advise DOWR senior management on departmental training requiremerts&#13;
and internal environmental awareness programs.&#13;
3     Participate as requested by DOE in reviews of EAs for non-water resources sector&#13;
projects affecting water allocation, pollution or regional planning.&#13;
14.   Planning Capability. In order to successfully fulfill the demanding requirements of Basin&#13;
Planning, it will be essential that high quality experienced planning staff capabilities be maintained&#13;
with the highest possible standards. Computer usage and hydrological/hydraulics modeling skills&#13;
must be evident among staff as well as long experience in project planning. Required skills would&#13;
include engineering, but would also include applied socio-economic, environmental, agricultural,&#13;
irrigation, plan formulation and other disciplines as would be required in the skill mix of any&#13;
successful planning organization. Maintenance of the high-tech skills required will require&#13;
motivating incentives to maintain proper staff levels and long-term continuity of posting.&#13;
Measures provided for under the project include staff accommodations, access to training and&#13;
favored promotion prospects for staff willing to stay in the specialty. Continuous training in&#13;
computer and computer related disciplines will also be required.&#13;
15.   Agreements Related to Basin Planning. Basin planning in Orissa is facilitated by the fact&#13;
that there are no river basins that involve international waterways. However, there are basins&#13;
affected by inter-state agreements for which full allowance has been made in the WRCP&#13;
investment program. Allowance also must be made in the respective basin plans of the future.&#13;
These basins and respective major Agreements are listed below:&#13;

16.   Status of Mahanadi Basin Modeling Contract. In response to prior Bank&#13;
recommendations, DOWR through OWPO has initiated a detailed mathematical study of the&#13;
Mahanadi River Basin. M/s Delft Hydraulics (Netherlands) on behalf of M/s Euroconsult visited&#13;
Orissa in November 1994 and conducted preliminary studies and submitted a Status Report. The&#13;
basin planning model RIBASIM was also installed in the OWPO Directorate. This visit, and&#13;
subsequent visits in 1995, resulted in the transfer of considerable technology including the&#13;
following activities and planned tasks which, in turn, will be necessary for the continued&#13;
attainment of WRCP basin planning objectives:&#13;
(a)   application of the river basin simulation model RIBASIM to the Mahanadi basin:&#13;
model implementation, schematization, set up of data base, simulation runs,&#13;
analysis of results&#13;
(b)   introduction to the other models of the computational framework&#13;

This small consultancy, terminating in 1995, will be followed by invitation to consulting firms to&#13;
submit offers for the larger consultancy over the full WRCP period. The consultant provisions for&#13;
basin planning would form part of the overall consultancy arrangement described in Annex 13.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Systems Improvement And Farmer Turnover&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Existing irrigation development in Orissa is not performing well with average yield of&#13;
clean rice at about 1.6 tons/ha compared to the national average of 3.2 tons/ha. Irrigation systems&#13;
suffer from a lack of control during the monsoon season and reduced levels of maintenance have&#13;
resulted in poor performance of the canal system. The efficiency of existing irrigation schemes&#13;
should be substantially improved to increase agricultural productivity. Systems should be able to&#13;
provide water services that are reliable, equitable, and sustainable in the long term. Through the&#13;
System Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SIFT) component of the Project, selected existing&#13;
irrigation systems will undergo structural improvements to enhance reliability and equity.&#13;
Concurrently, there will be increased participation by irrigators in system enhancement and then&#13;
turnover of the downstream parts of systems to Water User Associations (WUAs). Increased&#13;
levels of service will then attract higher levels of water fees that will recover the cost of service&#13;
provision. Operations and maintenance management and program delivery will also be&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Organized irrigation in Orissa dates back about 130 years. However, many schemes have&#13;
been constructed over the last 30 years and the area currently under irrigation is 1.155 million ha.&#13;
Of this, the Department of Water Resources (DOWR) provides irrigation facilities to a total&#13;
culturable command area (CCA) of 792,000 ha. Major irrigation projects serve 597,000 ha, and&#13;
medium projects 195,000 ha. The remainder, 363,000 ha, is in minor irrigation projects under the&#13;
management control of the Rural Development Department. A lack of non-plan funding for&#13;
operations and maintenance over time has resulted in the deterioration of the physical&#13;
infrastructure and a breakdown in systems capability to provide the designed level of service.&#13;
This has contributed significantly to the low productivity of irrigated agriculture in the state.&#13;
Objective&#13;
3.    The objective of the SIFT component is to raise agricultural productivity and ensure&#13;
system sustainability in perpetuity through:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitation and modernization of system infrastructure;&#13;
(b)   reorganized institutional and management arrangements on a river basin approach&#13;
for water services management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(c)    adoption of a preventive maintenance philosophy;&#13;
(d)    priority funding of the maintenance program on a needs basis;&#13;
(e)    strengthening O&amp;M program management capabilities and processes;&#13;
(f)    moving over time to pricing water services at cost; and&#13;
(g)   increased participation by farmers in system management by turning over the&#13;
downstream parts of systems to water user groups.&#13;
System Deficiencies&#13;
4.    This component of the project will target about 265,400 ha of CCA in 25 existing&#13;
schemes. Eight of these schemes are the balance of work started under the National Water&#13;
Management Project (NWMP) covering 109,800 ha, and the bulk of the work is in 17 schemes&#13;
and one diversion weir headworks structure covering 155,600 ha. Existing system deficiencies&#13;
have been identified by DOWR, with assistance from national and international consultants, and&#13;
include design errors, lack of water regulating and control structures, lack of measuring devices,&#13;
lack of access for operations and maintenance, and deteriorated structures and earthworks&#13;
through lack of proper maintenance and old age. It is these structural problems that have led to&#13;
the present situation of unreliability and inequitable water distribution. In more detail, the&#13;
identified problems are:&#13;
(a)    System Design Problems: Inadequate capacity of the main canal due to design and&#13;
construction errors (Jayamangal); inadequate control structures (Baitarani,&#13;
Dadarghati, Hiradharbati, Jayamangal, Kendrapara, Pilasalki, Rushikulya, and&#13;
Sakhigopal); inadequate capacity of head regulators (Hiradharbati);&#13;
(b)    Structural and Maintenance Problems: Damaged or deteriorated masonry and&#13;
concrete structures including outlets, canal lining (all systems), cross drainage&#13;
structures (almost all systems) and the major structures at the Baitarani anicut&#13;
under sluice and the Janivilli anicut of the Rushikulya system; and&#13;
(c)    System Capacity Constraints: Heavy siltation (almost all systems), drainage and&#13;
flooding problems (Kendrapara, Sakhigopal).&#13;
5.    The cumulative effect of these system deficiencies manifests itself ultimately in poor&#13;
agricultural productivity because of poor system performance. Systems suffer from inadequate&#13;
water management and control, and poor maintenance and exhibit low operational efficiencies&#13;
that do not provide farmers with water services that are reliable and equitable. On average, for&#13;
the 17 schemes under the WRCP, only about 57 percent of the CCA receives full irrigation in the&#13;
kharif This leaves about 42 percent, or 65,597 ha, receiving only partial irrigation. Sirnilarly in&#13;
the rabi season, 20 percent of the CCA receives full irrigation. Under the project all the CCA will&#13;
receive full irrigation in the khariff, and the area receiving full service in the rabi will be increased&#13;

Institutional Arrangements for Water Services&#13;
6.    The full range of water services provided by DOWR will be managed through a new&#13;
senior management position of the office of Chief Engineer, Water Services, and by four new&#13;
river basin line management units. Management at CE level will have responsibility for the&#13;
program and budget for this function and the SIFT component. The office will concentrate on the&#13;
overall direction, policy setting standardization of processes in the line units, and performance,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of O&amp;M programs and service delivery. Management of the river&#13;
basin units will be along functional lines and will bring together under one line of management the&#13;
presently fragmented O&amp;M functions of irrigation, bulk water supply, agricultural drainage, and&#13;
flood control. The institutional modifications proposed under the project are at Annex 3. This&#13;
reorganization would lead to improvements in the quality of service delivery through coordinated&#13;
management of O&amp;M programs across the range of services delivered within each water system.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 17&#13;
The concentration of O&amp;M functions would lead to cost savings through the more efficient use of&#13;
resources such as labor, equipment, and vehicles. There would be less duplication of effort, and&#13;
this will result in improvements in the efficiency of resource use.&#13;
Infrastructure Improvements&#13;
7.    The system level improvements under the WRCP are a continuum of:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation. Reestablishing original designed or agreed levels of service through&#13;
the injection of funds as a one-time program of works that addresses deferred&#13;
maintenance requirements;&#13;
(b)   Modernization. Enhancing the performance and increasing the efficiency of water&#13;
systems through investment in modernization programs over time; and&#13;
(c)    Operations and Maintenance. Ensuring the long-term effectiveness of water&#13;
system performance through adequate maintenance and timely replacement of&#13;
assets.&#13;
8.    Therefore the system level objectives are, first, to restore and enhance system performance&#13;
to improve operational efficiency, and then, to institute a fully funded and effective maintenance&#13;
program that will ensure the delivery of reliable and equitable services that farmers want and are&#13;
prepared to pay for.&#13;
9.    Rehabilitation and modernization works by scheme at main and distributary canal level are&#13;
summarized in Table 2, and Table 3 summarizes the costs of civil works for each scheme. The&#13;
civil works component for the 17 schemes covering 155,576 ha will involve 1,077 bridges, 1,033&#13;
regulators, 16.46 million cum of earthworks in desilting and bank strengthening, construction of&#13;
422 new water measuring devices, and lining of unlined canals to assist with canal bank stability in&#13;
sidling country and waterway erosion. The average cost is Rs. 12,600/ha. Works for the balance&#13;
of NWMP schemes cover 109,800 ha at an average cost of Rs. 2,785/ha. Farmers will have input&#13;
into the design of works, particularly at the lower end of systems, and also implementation&#13;
planning and execution of works to ensure minimum disruption to agricultural production.&#13;
Structured Design of Irrigation Networks&#13;
10.   One of the keys in improving both equity and reliability is the adoption of the structured&#13;
design concept for modernizing existing schemes. New water control structures will be&#13;
constructed, or existing ones upgraded, to allow delivery of proportional flow to all segments of&#13;
the canal below the structured level, which is usually the head of a distributary or, in some cases, a&#13;
minor, without the need for manual regulation below that level. The objective is to ensure&#13;
delivery of water to all offlakes below the structured level in proportion to the command area.&#13;

An effective monitoring and evaluation system will be introduced that will monitor system&#13;
operational performance against the daily, weekly, and seasonal water plans. Data collected will&#13;
include water flow measurements and canal running levels, reservoir operational data, river flows,&#13;
and rainfall. Other related data will include area cropped, crop type, and crop yield data. (Crop&#13;
area, type, and yields in the selected parts of commands of Hirakud, Mahanadi Delta Stages I &amp;&#13;
II, Salandi and Rushikulya will be monitored using remote sensing techniques.) Maintenance&#13;
equipment will be upgraded and new procedures implemented to ensure effective utilization of the&#13;
equipment. Daily operations will be improved through the provision of better measurement and&#13;
control of water, enhanced mobility of operators, improved communications and reporting&#13;
procedures for the daily flow data.&#13;

Farmer Organization and Tumover&#13;
12.   The farmer organization and turnover (FOT) component will be an integral part of the&#13;
rehabilitation and modemization strategy of the overall project. Three important features of the&#13;
WRCP approach to water user participation are:&#13;
(a)    The implementation of organizing efforts will be closely integrated with physical&#13;
improvements to be funded under the project. Organizational efforts will precede&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 17&#13;
implementation of minor-level rehabilitation works to ensure that farmers are&#13;
committed to maintaining the improvements,&#13;
(b)   The focus of organizing activities will be at the minor or small distributary level. A&#13;
single WUA will be formed to manage the entire minor, or in the case of larger&#13;
command areas, several WUAs may be formed. The size of WUAs will range&#13;
from 300 ha to 600 ha. Turnover of O&amp;M responsibilities at this level will result&#13;
in significant cost savings to DOWR and improved water management;&#13;
(c)    The terms and conditions of turnover will be specified out in a written contract&#13;
(Memorandum of Understanding) between DOWR as well as the newly created&#13;
distributary or minor-level associations.&#13;
13.   The turnover program will be introduced initially in three schemes: Aunli, Ghodahada,&#13;
and Rushikulya Distributary 11, comprising a total command area of 15,519 ha. Based on the&#13;
experience gained in this first phase of organizing activity, the bulk of WRCP project areas (an&#13;
additional 135,000 ha) will be taken up in two successive phases during years 2 through 7 of the&#13;
project. The strategy is one of structured learning, with close monitoring and evaluation after&#13;
each stage, resulting in reformulating the approach for the next stage.&#13;
Structured Systems&#13;
A key element in the WRCP approach to improved system design will be the introduction&#13;
of a structured system to provide equitable water distribution with minimum operational&#13;
complexity (Figure 1). Below the structured level, usually a distributary or minor, control&#13;
structures will be provided at all offtake canals that distribute water in the desired proportion&#13;
without manual control. These control structures are either of undershot or overshot type,&#13;
depending on whether they function as an orifice or as a weir/flume. Above the structured level,&#13;
gauged controls or long crested weirs will be used to ensure maintenance of water levels and&#13;
discharges in the reaches as per seasonal requirements. Below the structured level the system will&#13;
run either at full supply level or will be closed, i.e., run as an "on/off' system. Variations to water&#13;
requirements will be met through changes in duration of supply. Isolation gates to operate the&#13;
canal system on an on/off schedule would be installed at farmers' request to provide them the&#13;
possibility to close offlakes when water is not needed.&#13;
The successful implementation of the system will depend upon three principal factors: (i)&#13;
proper choice of the level of structuring; (ii) availability of an adequate margin of safety at the&#13;
head regulator of the structured network, so that required full discharge below can be drawn&#13;
under expected variations in the main canal water level; and (iii) proper design, construction, and&#13;
maintenance of canal control structures at all offtakes of the structured network.&#13;

Structure and Function of Farmer Organizations&#13;
14.    A three-tiered organization is envisioned, with organizing activities focused at the minor&#13;
or distributary level (300-600 ha). WUAs will be established based on hydraulic boundaries&#13;
where possible. The WUA's executive body will comprise representatives from each field channel&#13;
or sub-area; however, this lowest level of organization is intended to remain informal. At the&#13;
scheme level, a federation of all WUAs will be established that will have a formal but non-binding&#13;
advisory role in main system operations and maintenance.&#13;
15.    The function of the WUAs will be:&#13;
(a)     to advise the DOWR on minor-level improvements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 9 of 17&#13;
(b)   to operate and maintain the distributary/minor canals and structures that will be&#13;
improved under WRCP;&#13;
(c)   to collect irrigation fees on behalf of the DOWR;&#13;
(d)   to ensure equitable water distribution among the WUA members; and&#13;
(e)   through the apex council, to advise the DOWR on main system operations as these&#13;
affect operations within the WUA's management purview.&#13;
16.   Along with added management responsibilities, WUAs would enjoy specific rights which&#13;
would be included in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) negotiated with the DOWR. A&#13;
model MOU is given in Attachment 1. These rights will define the amount of water which the&#13;
DOWR agrees to supply either in absolute or relative terms, and will specify the time frame within&#13;
which the water is to be delivered. Additional provisions (e.g., use of DOWR equipment for&#13;
maintenance) could also be included in the MOU.&#13;
Vision&#13;
17.   The FOT component is seen as the beginning of a long-term process leading to a new&#13;
relationship between irrigation farmers and the government. Through the WUA, farmers and the&#13;
DOWR will have a vehicle for dialogue and negotiation. As the macro-policy environment&#13;
changes, and in particular as farmers' irrigation fees are increased and the DOWR is rendered&#13;
more financially accountable, both sides will have stronger incentives for management transfer&#13;
from the department to farmers. As DOWR staffing intensity decreases and becomes more&#13;
specialized, there will be a greater need for an apex organization representing individual WUAs&#13;
and serving as an interface with the DOWR. The role of the apex organization is therefore&#13;
anticipated to evolve from advisory to operational with complete management transfer from&#13;
DOWR to the apex organization occurring in many of the medium systems at least.&#13;
Implementation Strategy&#13;
18.   Because Orissa has almost no experience in water user associations, a phased introduction&#13;
of FOT is proposed. The initial phase of the FOT program will be confined to three systems&#13;
totaling 15,519 ha or about 10 percent of the area that will eventually come under the FOT&#13;
program during the life of the WRCP. Phase 1 is anticipated to run for about two years. The&#13;
experience of the program will be intensively monitored by the FOT Consultant attached to the&#13;
DOWR CE Water Services and by WALMI staff. After about 18 months, an evaluation of Phase&#13;
1 will be conducted culminating in an FOT planning workshop which will define the approach to&#13;
be taken in Phase 2. A similar evaluation of Phase 2 will be conducted about 3.5 years into the&#13;
project and will provide the basis for planning for Phase 3.&#13;
19.   The three pilot areas to be taken up under Phase 1 represent three categories of system as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 10 of 17&#13;
(a)   Aunli, at 1,746 ha is the smallest system within WRCP and is a fully independent&#13;
system from both a hydraulic and economic perspective: within the river basin&#13;
there are no other irrigation systems above or immediately below, nor is there any&#13;
major source of employment in the immediate vicinity. Aunli represents the&#13;
category of relatively small and discrete systems where management costs to the&#13;
DOWR tend to be high, and full turnover to an apex organization would appear&#13;
feasible even in the short-term;&#13;
(b)   Ghodahada, at 7,203 ha is a medium-size scheme that comprises a discrete&#13;
hydraulic unit but that is large enough that full turnover is probably not a short-&#13;
term possibility. Here an apex committee would have the potential for serving an&#13;
important advisory role in main system water distribution; and&#13;
(c)   Rushikulya comprises some 34,090 ha in all, of which only one distributary&#13;
(Distributary 11, totaling 6,570 ha) will be included in the Phase 1 FOT program.&#13;
The hydraulics of this system are complicated by multiple water sources and tanks&#13;
within the command area which function as additional storage. In this situation,&#13;
the long-term objective of the FOT program would be apex committees for major&#13;
hydraulic subdivisions.&#13;
20.   During Phase I of the FOT program, two and possibly three concurrent approaches will&#13;
be pursued: (i) a "DOWR approach" whereby the organizing of WUAs will be carried out&#13;
through DOWR staff (JEs) supplemented by trained social organizers; (ii) an "NGO approach"&#13;
whereby one or two NGOs will take responsibility for organizing WUAs in a sub-command (e.g.,&#13;
part of Rushikulya Distributary I 1) or an entire small command (e.g., Aunli system); and possibly&#13;
(iii) an "agro-business approach" whereby an agro-business that is already active in an irrigated&#13;
area would take responsibility for organizing WUAs to assume irrigation management within a&#13;
particular zone.&#13;
Legal Arrangements&#13;
21.   The WUAs would be registered under the state Societies Registration Act, for which there&#13;
is already legal precedent through pilot activities of CADA and WALMI. The WUA will be&#13;
guided by the provisions in its bylaws and by the Societies Registration Act. Model By-laws are&#13;
given as Attachment 2. This document constitutes a suggested model which would be revised&#13;
during the process of forming the WUA to meet any specific circumstances.&#13;
22.   The agreement between the WJUA and the DOWR regarding rights and responsibilities for&#13;
irrigation O&amp;M will be spelled out in a MOU. This model MOU would be tailored to the specific&#13;
circumstances of each WUA, and its provisions would be revised and negotiated in each case.&#13;
The MOU will serve as a contract between the two legal entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 11 of 17&#13;
Financing Arrangements&#13;
23.   Under the WRCP, farmers will be asked to share a larger proportion of the total&#13;
management burden than is currently the case. Most of the increased burden will be in-kind, that&#13;
is, through participation in the activities of management (attending meetings, keeping records,&#13;
monitoring water levels, adjusting flows, resolving disputes, etc.). However, there will also be&#13;
increased financial costs to farmers. To ensure a minimal level of O&amp;M funding for the&#13;
minor/distributary commands under their control, WUAs will be required to establish an O&amp;M&#13;
fund prior to management transfer.&#13;
24.   While the arrangements will be flexible during Phase I of the FOT program, the suggestion&#13;
is for Rs. 250/ha (Rs. 1 00/acre) to be collected and held in a fixed-deposit interest bearing&#13;
account. The annual yield of roughly Rs. 30/ha would be supplemented by additional collections&#13;
from the members if O&amp;M costs exceed the interest payment. Based on the experience of Phase&#13;
I, the financial arrangements will be finalized and will become a condition for signing an MOU&#13;
between the WUA and DOWR.&#13;
25.   In order to provide an incentive to farmers to enter into the higher cost management&#13;
arrangements promoted through the WRCP, two types of rebate provisions are anticipated. The&#13;
first type of rebate will accrue to WUAs that agree to collect irrigation fees on behalf of the&#13;
DOWR. The precise amount will vary according to a sliding scale of collection rates (higher&#13;
rebates for higher rates of collection) and will be specified in the MOU.&#13;
26.   The second type of rebate will comprise a reduced fee structure for farmers in those&#13;
minors/distributaries where the WUA has formally assumed management, thereby replacing some&#13;
DOWR functions. The amount of the rebate will be negotiated as part of the MOU, but will be&#13;
based on a principle of equal division of the DOWR's recurrent cost savings between the&#13;
department and the WUA. For example, if the management costs to the DOWR are reduced by&#13;
Rs. 200,000/year, the total reduction of irrigation fees to the WUA members should be about Rs.&#13;
1 00,000/year. Both types of rebate provisions will be reviewed on the basis of Phase I experience&#13;
and may be revised and/or standardized for Phases 2 and 3.&#13;
Implementing the FOT Program&#13;
27.   Developing the capacity to implement the FOT program will be the first step, followed by&#13;
the actual implementation. All phases of this process will require substantial training inputs, the&#13;
outline of which are contained in Attachment 3. In addition to training, technical assistance&#13;
consultancies and inputs from NGOs will be necessary elements of implementation. A sample&#13;
agreement between DOWR and an NGO is at Attachment 4. This section outlines the process&#13;
leading to O&amp;M turnover that will be followed under the DOWR approach. (The details of the&#13;
NGO and agro-enterprise approaches would be determined by those organizations, in consultation&#13;
with the DOWR.) The implementation process is subdivided into four phases: preparation,&#13;
assessment, organization, and joint management, leading to turnover.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 12 of 17&#13;
(a)   Preparation Phase (variable duration): Two dimensions of preparation are (a)&#13;
institutional strengthening of the organizations which will implement the FOT&#13;
program (e.g., DOWR, WALMI, and one or two NGOs), and (b) attitudinal&#13;
change on the part of the DOWR. A series of training activities will help address&#13;
both dimensions. Through the assistance of SOPECOM, an NGO based in Pune,&#13;
WALMI faculty will be exposed to FOT concepts as practiced in Maharashtra.&#13;
With the assistance of the same organization, the DOWR will recruit a senior&#13;
consultant to advise on the FOT program, and report directly to the DOWR&#13;
Engineer-in-Chief The FOT consultant will work with WALMI faculty in&#13;
conducting a series of appreciation workshops for senior and mid-level DOWR&#13;
staff, and orientation workshops for NGOs and social organizers who will become&#13;
involved in the FOT program.&#13;
(b)   Assessment Phase (about 3 months): This phase is preceded by a four-day training&#13;
program at WALMI for the concerned SDOs, JEs, and social organizers. During&#13;
this phase, the JEs and SOs will initiate discussions with farmers about the WRCP&#13;
improvements, management needs, and the potential for establishing a W1UA. The&#13;
JEs will be responsible for an area of 2,000-3,000 ha. Their initial activity will be&#13;
to arrange participatory walk-throughs of each distributary, along with DOWR&#13;
project staff and farmers, to begin a dialogue about priority improvements. Other&#13;
tasks during this phase include compiling a list of actual farmers and the&#13;
landholders, a detailed map of the official and actual command area (including&#13;
unauthorized/authorized water use), and a rough assessment of the organizational&#13;
capacity of farmers in each distributary area, including information on any existing&#13;
formal or informal organizvtions).&#13;
(c)   Organizing Phase (4-6 months): The process of organizing farmers will precede&#13;
any construction activities at the distributary level or below. The logic for this is&#13;
to ensure that farmers are committed to maintaining any improvements that will&#13;
come under their O&amp;M responsibility. The JEs, with assistance from the social&#13;
organizers, will begin a long series of informal meetings with farmers throughout&#13;
the command to discuss the turnover concept. The women organizers will meet&#13;
with women farmers and encourage their participation in the WUA. A listing of&#13;
proposed improvements will form part of the provisional MOU to be drawn up&#13;
jointly by DOWR and farmers, with the help of the FOT team. This provisional&#13;
MOU will serve as a common reference point in discussing the rights and&#13;
responsibilities of the WUA and the DOWR. A provisional MOU will be drawn as&#13;
a reference for discussing the details of the WUA's eventual rights and&#13;
responsibilities. After delegates are selected, the JE will be able to work through&#13;
the executive committee to help with Council registration. The executive&#13;
committee will then negotiate the detailed terms of the MOU for transfer of O&amp;M&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
(d)   Joint Management Phase (2-6 months): During this phase, the WUAs will learn&#13;
how to manage the distributary. Farmers will work closely with DOWR field staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 13 of 17&#13;
to understand how to read water levels, how to adjust gates (if needed in the&#13;
particular distributary), and how to maintain the new improvements. With help&#13;
from the JE and other DOWR staff, the WUA will also develop an operational plan&#13;
for water distribution. Prior to formal turnover, a test of the water flows will be&#13;
conducted to ensure that the physical facilities are in order. The DOWR Executive&#13;
Engineer will then formally turn over responsibility to the WUA.&#13;
Staffing Requirements for FOT Implementation&#13;
28.   While the bulk of the FOT program will be carried out by existing DOWR staff, there are&#13;
several critical inputs that will be needed. These are given by institution:&#13;
(a)   WALMI: At least two full-time staff will need during the implementation of the&#13;
FOT program. One will coordinate a mobile extension campaign, and the other&#13;
will coordinate the FOT training programs;&#13;
(b)   DOWR Management: A full-time senior consultant will be required to work&#13;
directly with the EIC in coordinating the FOT program. It is highly preferable that&#13;
he or she have backstopping from an external organization (NGO or research&#13;
institute) for M&amp;E functions. A summary position description is given in&#13;
Attachment 5.&#13;
(c)   DOWR Field Implementation: During Phase 1 of the FOT program, the intensity&#13;
of JEs in the pilot areas will be increased to about one JE per 1,500 ha. This will&#13;
require an additional seven JEs to be re-deployed into the pilot areas during the&#13;
two-year pilot phase. In addition, a team of two to three social organizers will be&#13;
recruited on a temporary basis for Ghodahada and Rushikulya (total of five&#13;
organizers). Since it is anticipated that Aunli system will be handled by an NGO,&#13;
any social organizers would be provided through the NGO directly. Descriptions&#13;
of the duties of the JEs and SOs is given in Attachment 6.&#13;
29.   The proposed organizational arrangement for the FOT program is at Attachment 7.&#13;
Operations and Maintenance Equipment and Vehicles&#13;
30.   The capacity to deliver O&amp;M programs will be increased by the procurement of selected&#13;
equipment, vehicles, and tools that improve the productivity and effectiveness of some key&#13;
maintenance activities. The mobility of both operations and maintenance staff will be enhanced by&#13;
the provision of trucks, jeeps, and motor bikes. The effectiveness of these vehicles will be further&#13;
enhanced by the fitting of two-way radios. Other light equipment such as concrete mixers, air&#13;
compressors, portable pumps, and survey equipment will support construction and maintenance&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 14 of 17&#13;
Financing Operations and Maintenance&#13;
31.   The GOO has increased its annual budget for O&amp;M with effect from the 1994/95 year and&#13;
has allocated separate funding for the works component of O&amp;M. Works will receive an average&#13;
of Rs. 200/ha maintained in real terms.&#13;
32.   The management of O&amp;M programs through proper programming, budgeting, planning,&#13;
and scheduling of O&amp;M expenditure and activities will be strengthened under the project by the&#13;
introduction of programming and budgeting at the center, and the development of specific plans&#13;
of operations and maintenance for each project. A model POM for Sakhigopal command has&#13;
been developed with consultant assistance during preparation. This will be used as a guide in the&#13;
development of POMs for the other commands. Typical formats for inspection, budgeting, and&#13;
planning and scheduling of O&amp;M activities are shown at Attachments 8, 9 and 10 respectively.&#13;
33.   Budgetary Procedures. The budget process within the DOWR is coordinated by the EIC.&#13;
He coordinates all activities, obtaining government approvals and allocating the funds to&#13;
Superintending Engineers and Executive Engineers responsible for O&amp;M. The budget process&#13;
starts early, usually in August of each year. The financial year runs from April through the&#13;
following March. The process starts with the Executive Engineers responsible for O&amp;M at&#13;
irrigation system level compiling budget needs and submitting them for review by the&#13;
Superintending Engineers in August. Consolidated budgets are submitted to the Chief Engineers&#13;
and then to the EIC in September. The DOWR consolidated budget requirements for the next&#13;
financial year are then submitted to the Secretary toward the end of September. The Secretary in&#13;
turn submits the Departmental proposal to the Secretary Finance who prepares the budget for&#13;
voting by the Assembly. Notification of the final budget bids for each scheme to be submitted to&#13;
the Assembly is given to the DOWR by the Secretary Finance in November. The State&#13;
Legislature votes on the budget in February/March and this decision is conveyed to the EIC. He&#13;
in turn advises the SE/EEs of their respective allocations for the new financial year. EEs are then&#13;
authorized to incur expenditure on O&amp;M through a Letter of Credit issued by the Finance&#13;
Department on a quarterly basis supported by a recommendation of the CE/EIC. The early&#13;
allocation of budget helps the EEs in planning their O&amp;M works activities.&#13;
Training&#13;
34.   The overall training program will be managed by WALMI who will be the training&#13;
provider, or will organize external providers where training is outside the scope of their&#13;
capabilities. Existing capacity for promoting participatory irrigation management is limited to (i)&#13;
WALMI's recently introduced action research program to create a few pilot water user&#13;
associations, and (ii) the CADA program which has focused on small groups at the outlet level.&#13;
Implementing the proposed FOT program will require a substantial and continuous training effort&#13;
during the life of the project.&#13;
35.   Training to Support FOT. The following outline of training activities comprises an action&#13;
plan for the first phase of the FOT program. Based on the experience of this initial 2-3 year&#13;
phase, the training program will be revised and refined to better meet the needs of the second and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 15 of 17&#13;
third phases of the FOT program. Except where noted, all training activities listed here will be&#13;
conducted by WALMI faculty, at the main training facilities near Cuttack. Details of each training&#13;
activity are given at Attachment 11.&#13;
(a)   Appreciation Workshop (Senior Level). A one- or two-day workshop to&#13;
introduce the concepts and implementation plans for WRCP and discuss the farmer&#13;
organization and turnover component.&#13;
(b)   Field Reconnaissance. WALMI staff will conduct rapid reconnaissance visits to&#13;
the three Phase I projects (Aunli, Ghodahada, and Rushikulya Dsty 11) to gain&#13;
familiarity with conditions in each scheme as a first step in preparing training&#13;
materials.&#13;
(c)   Legal Training Workshop. A one-day training workshop for WALMI faculty to&#13;
become familiar with the legal aspects of farmer organization and turnover.&#13;
(d)   Appreciation Workshops (Middle Level). A two-day workshop for EEs, and&#13;
SDOs from the systems to be taken up for Phase I FOT activities.&#13;
(e)   Farmer Organization Guidelines. A practical handbook for JEs and other members&#13;
of the organizing team (khalasis, patrols, and social organizers). In addition to&#13;
providing guidance during implementation of organizing activities, the guidelines&#13;
will also provide a common framework for the various training activities. They&#13;
will be written in the Oriya language. An initial draft of the guidelines will be&#13;
completed in time for the Assessment Workshop.&#13;
(f)   PRA Training Workshop. A two-day workshop for WALMI faculty to gain&#13;
exposure to principles and field methods of participatory rural appraisal, and to&#13;
devise an approach that can be applied to participatory planning of distributary&#13;
improvements.&#13;
(g)   Assessment Workshop for JEs. The initial training workshop for the SDOs, JEs,&#13;
and social organizers who will be implementing the FOT component.&#13;
(h)   Participatory Design Fieldwork. A two-day field PRA for all SDOs, JEs, and&#13;
social organizers working in the Phase I project areas. The training will be led by&#13;
one WALMI faculty and one resource person from an experienced NGO.&#13;
(i)    Organizing Workshop (JEs). A nine-day training workshop for Junior Engineers&#13;
to impart the basic skills needed for helping farmers organize distributary or minor-&#13;
level WUAs to assume O&amp;M responsibilities.&#13;
36.   Irrigation Management Training. This training component will have the objective of&#13;
strengthening the capacity of DOWR to better manage and deliver O&amp;M programs. Training will&#13;
cover the following skills areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 16 of 17&#13;
(a)    Management and Supervision. Aimed at improving skills of middle and senior&#13;
managers and supervisors in the areas of general management and program&#13;
delivery.&#13;
(b)   System Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. Aimed at middle and senior&#13;
managers to improve skills in analysis of system and program performance as part&#13;
of the management cycle.&#13;
(c)   Water Distribution and Measurement. Aimed at water distribution officers,&#13;
supervisors, and junior engineers to improve water service delivery and system&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
(d)   Construction and Maintenance. Aimed at C&amp;M workers, supervisors and junior&#13;
and assistant engineers to improve the effectiveness of CAM programs, quality of&#13;
construction, and programming and scheduling skills. Training will include&#13;
concrete, earth and steel construction and maintenance.&#13;
(e)   Limited national and international study tours. As an adjunct to the above training&#13;
subjects. These tours will be planned as part of the annual program of training,&#13;
and will be reviewed each year during the formal annual review process.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
37.   DOW1R will set up systematic program monitoring of the rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
works program using project management software. The projected expenditure by year for each&#13;
scheme is given in Table 4.&#13;
38.   System Improvement. O&amp;M performance will be evaluated annually through the program&#13;
and budget and cost accounting and cost allocation management systems to be introduced under&#13;
the project. O&amp;M program performance at scheme level will be reviewed in association with FCs&#13;
and other farmer groups. Annual reports for each command will be published by Basin Managers.&#13;
A suggested report format is at Attachment 12. The report will detail O&amp;M achievement, actual&#13;
and budgeted expenditure, and planned and actual water delivery performance across the year.&#13;
Rehabilitation and modernization programs will be monitored using the program and budgeting&#13;
system as well as computer supported project management tools.&#13;
39.   The project would also support the introduction and use of modern tools and techniques&#13;
to strengthen DOWR's monitoring and evaluation capability. Remote sensing will be used to&#13;
monitor impacts of the project in selected commands during the first two rabi seasons after&#13;
project start-up. Terms of reference for this remote sensing work are at Attachment 13. A&#13;
baseline survey using these techniques is being carried out in the major commands of Hirakud,&#13;
Mahanadi Delta stages I &amp; II, Salandi, and Rushikulya. Data will be gathered on cropping&#13;
patterns and yields for the 1995 rabi crop.&#13;

JOINT MANAGEMENT:&#13;
Joint management reters to operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) carried out&#13;
jointly by the Water Users' Association and Government. During this phase,&#13;
the Water Users' Assoc!ation will learn how to manage the entire system&#13;
that would be turned over to it. Joint management phase will begin when (i)&#13;
the Water Users' Association has been formed and registered, thereby&#13;
implying that informal outlet committees are in place (ii) office bearers of the&#13;
Water Users' Associat?on have been elected (iii) the operation and mainte-&#13;
nance fund has been established with relevant bank 2ccount. Durinc this&#13;
phase, the following actwvities will be undertaken.&#13;
(i)   Close collaboran!on between the Government (Project Officials' and&#13;
the Water Uscrs Association :hrough information exchange anad&#13;
transfer of shills.&#13;
(ii)   Government (Froject Officials) will prepare an operation plan fcr the&#13;
entire irrigatiorn system of the project concerned showing the wvater&#13;
availability, elocation made for irrigation, drinking water, industrial&#13;
and other uses. The Project off:cials will also prepare the me-hod&#13;
of distributing water to various distributaries, i.e. opening/closing of&#13;
canal and CNiOFF periods fcr all the distributaries and fcr the&#13;
distributary cf Yhe concerned Water Users' Association. The Water&#13;
Users' Assoc:a-ion in turn will prepare the operation plan fcr the&#13;
distributary under its jurisdicticn. The respective operation plans&#13;
will be discussed and modified as required.&#13;
(iii)  The office bearers of the Water Users' Asscciation, its represer:a-&#13;
tives or staff 'N:;l accompany the project officials during the c:era-&#13;
tion of the gate and head regulator observing and reading gauges,&#13;
accounting for wlater, working cut actual duty and depth of wa:er.&#13;
(iv)  The Project officials will conduct hydraulic tests of the distributary&#13;
to check the capacities at different points with the design. Similarly&#13;
tests for measurements of actual seepage losses will be carried out&#13;
by the inflow-outflow method. The methodology involved in such&#13;
tests will be exolained by the project officials to the Water Users'&#13;
Association.&#13;

(v)   The Water Users' Association will identify the shortage if any in the&#13;
fall of levels in water supply in the distributary at the outlets and&#13;
communicate to the project officials for follow up action.&#13;
(vi)  An automatic stage level recorder (ALR) will be installed immedi-&#13;
ately downstream of the head regulator of the distributary for&#13;
continuous record of water flows. The Water Users' Association will&#13;
be responsible for the safe custody of the ALR.&#13;
(vii) The distributary will be jointly inspected by the project officials and&#13;
the Water Users' Association before the season to identify the&#13;
status of maintenance and to list out items like silt removal and&#13;
weed clearance needing immediate/regular maintenance. The list&#13;
will also include items of repairs to earth work, raising of bund. and&#13;
repair to structures. The project officials will prepare an estimate o.&#13;
such works and discuss the list and related fundcng needs with the&#13;
Water Users' Association. The Water Users' Asscciaticn may&#13;
suggest items to be added. If these items cannot be accommcdatec&#13;
in the Departmental budget provision, th,en the Water Users&#13;
Association may indicate its contributions before estimates are&#13;
finalised. Contributions can be cash or in kind.&#13;
(viii) During the period of joint management, the Government will reserve&#13;
the right to operate the heaoworks and the main system. Ownership&#13;
of the system &amp; related works will continue to vest with Govern-&#13;
ment. Normally water supply to the distributary will be in accor-&#13;
dance with the distributary operation plan prepared, discussed and&#13;
agreed to by the Government and the Water Users' Associatiorn.&#13;
However, supplies to the distributary may be increased or reduced&#13;
in proportion to its share in case of short suppiy of water in the&#13;
system. To carry out its responsibility the Government will deplcy&#13;
necessary field staff. The Government will share with the Water&#13;
Users' Association relevant data in respect of canal design/actual&#13;
capacities and discharge, water levels at different cutlets, water&#13;
allocation, design details of APMS where applicable, seepage ano&#13;
operation losses. The Government will also maintain the main cana!&#13;
and branches to ensure designed discharge at the head regulator.&#13;
It will undertake repairs arising due to natural calamities such as&#13;
earth quakes, heavy rains or other unforeseen events. During the&#13;
joint management phase Govt. will train the Water Users' Associa-&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Scheme ComDletions Component&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     Following a review" in 1992 and 1993 of the expenditure programme of the Orissa&#13;
Irrigation Department, as the Department of Water Resources (DOWR) was then known, IDA&#13;
selected from DOWR's portfolio five medium irrigation projects' and parts of four major&#13;
projects3", which were then under construction for finance under the WRCP. Criteria for&#13;
selection included that: (a) construction was in progress, (b) adequate investigations had been&#13;
made to demonstrate the technical and economic viability, and (c) the estimated ERR for&#13;
completion was greater than 12%.&#13;
2.     A mission from FAO/CP visited Orissa in September and October 1992 and, on the&#13;
basis of reports prepared by DOWR and visits to site, prepared formulation reports for two&#13;
medium irrigation projects (Working Paper 1 - Harabhangi and Working Paper 2 -&#13;
Badanallae) to act as examples for DOWR to prepare similar reports for other schemes.&#13;
The mission also prepared summarized descriptions of the other ongoing irrigation projects in&#13;
Orissa (Working Paper 3). Working Paper 4 provided material for a review of OID&#13;
investment programme, and divided projects into five categories:&#13;
(a)       Extemally funded (Upper Indravati and Upper Kolab irrigation);&#13;
(b)       Large individual projects (e.g. Rengali);&#13;
(c)       Projects more than 90% complete (five majors, including Rengali and&#13;
Upper Kolab dams, and 9 medium projects);&#13;
(d)       Ongoing medium projects (six projects); and&#13;
(e)       Proposed new projects in DOWR's future portfolio which included 11&#13;
major and 12 medium projects. The only new project on which&#13;
construction had begun was Mahanadi-Chitrotpala Island but the need for&#13;
replacement of Naraj weir was also recognized.&#13;
See FAO/CP Reports 164/92 CP-IND 95 WP4 dated I December 1992 and 76/93 CP-IND 98 WPs dated 14&#13;
May 1993.&#13;
2v Medium irrigation projects are defined as having command areas between 2,000 ha and 10,000 ha.&#13;
3 Major irrigation projects are defined as having command areas greater than 10,000 ha.&#13;

3.     A mission from FAO/CP, which visited Orissa in April 1993, further reviewed the&#13;
expenditure programme and prepared an identification report on Naraj barrage5'. Following&#13;
a World Bank mission in October and November 1993, the completions component of WRCP&#13;
was provisionally determined to comprise parts of Rengali, Upper Indravati and Upper Kolab&#13;
major irrigation projects6', construction of Naraj barrage and completion of five medium&#13;
projects (Badanalla, Harabhangi, Hariharjore, Upper Jonk and Baghua Stage II)". This&#13;
mission also reviewed resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people (see Annex&#13;
10), operation and maintenance of completed schemes, and improvement of existing schemes&#13;
and turnover of schemes to farmers (see Annex 6). An environmental assessment of Orissa&#13;
WRCP was prepared by Department of Irrigation and Snowy Mountain Engineering&#13;
Corporation6'. The OWRCP's Environmental Assessment was further updated by DOWR in&#13;
consultation with the World Bank in February/March 1995. Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
has been handled by separate specialist consultants and DOWR's new R&amp;R Directorate in&#13;
consultation with the Bank (Annex 10). Each eventually chosen sub-project under the&#13;
Scheme Completions component has had a detailed Socio-economic Survey and Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP) prepared, as well as an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).&#13;
4.      Preparation of the scheme completion component was further advanced and the&#13;
Mahanadi-Chitrotpala Island subproject was reviewed by missions in March 19949' and June&#13;
and July 1994 "' and visits from World Bank consultants and staff in August to October&#13;
1994. A mission to appraise the scheme completion component, which visited Orissa from 22&#13;
November to 7 December"', reviewed project reports prepared by DOWR and agreed to the&#13;
request of DOWR for the omission of the Upper Kolab subproject from WRCP. At&#13;
Appraisal, Upper Indravati was excluded as the investment proposal was not ready for&#13;
Appraisal.&#13;
The Scheme Completion Component&#13;
5.     The component would include a prioritized and selected group of uncompleted major&#13;
and medium irrigation projects in Orissa. The component, which is summarized in Table 1,&#13;
would comprise eight subprojects, shown on Figure 1 and described in Sections B to H of this&#13;
Annex and summarized below:&#13;
(a)       Construction of part of Rengali irrigation project, including completion of&#13;
Samal barrage, completion of the first 30 km of the left bank main canal&#13;
and construction of irrigation and drainage works for 8,483 ha.&#13;

(b)      Completion of Mahanadi-Chitrotpala irrigation and drainage scheme in&#13;
the Mahanadi delta including remodelling of Kendrapara canal,&#13;
excavation and lining of a link canal, balance works for Chitrotpala&#13;
syphon and completion of the distribution and drainage network on an&#13;
command area of 15,342.&#13;
(c)      Construction of Naraj barrage to replace the dilapidated existing weir in&#13;
the Mahanadi delta.&#13;
(d)      Completion of five medium irrigation projects:&#13;
Badanalla               8,650 ha&#13;
Harabhangi              9,150 ha&#13;
Hariharjore             9,450 ha&#13;
Upper Jonk    9,425 ha&#13;
Baghua Stage II         6,240 ha (including 3,000 ha in Stage I).&#13;
(e)      Technical assistance and training as needed (Annex 13) and establishment&#13;
of organizations for operating and maintaining the completed subprojects.&#13;
Resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people, also funded under the OWRCP, are&#13;
described in Annex 10.&#13;
6.     The salient features of the component are summarized in Table 1, past and estimated&#13;
future expenditures in Table 2 and the main engineering features are summarized in Table 3.&#13;
The total area to be newly irrigated would be about 52,000 ha and incremental annual&#13;
production would include about 77,000 tons of paddy, 25,000 tons of oilseeds, 25,000 tons of&#13;
groundnuts, 77,000 tons of vegetables and about 57,000 tons of sugarcane. Base cost would&#13;
be about Rs. 4,643 million (US$144 million) and total cost Rs. 6,958.4 million (US$189&#13;
million - see Annex 18). The ERR of the component has been estimated to be 22% (see&#13;
Annex 19).&#13;
Design Principles&#13;
7.     Hydrology and Crop Water Requirements. Water availability has been based on&#13;
75% reliability calculated from simulations of reservoir operation based on measured or&#13;
calculated flows for periods of at least 20 years. Crop water requirements have been based&#13;
on potential evapotranspiration calculated for each month using the Penman-Monteith method.&#13;
Assumed cropping patterns and cropping calendars have been approved by the Orissa&#13;
Department of Agriculture. Crop water requirements were calculated for each period of ten&#13;
days, taking account of effective rainfall. Irrigation efficiencies were assumed to be 64% for&#13;
wet paddy and 42% for other crops.&#13;
8.     Earth Dams. The Badanalla, Harabhangi, Hariharjore, Upper Jonk and Baghua&#13;
irrigation subprojects include earthen dams with gated ogee spillways. The earth dam&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 17&#13;
sections are of homogeneous rolled earthfill of low permeability material and with a vertical&#13;
chimney drain and horizontal drainage blanket connected to the rock toe and draining into a&#13;
toe drain. These sections were approved by the Directorate of Designs of DOWR on the&#13;
basis of test results of samples from the borrow areas and after checking the suitability of the&#13;
shear parameters from the embankment and foundation material. Control of seepage through&#13;
foundations is achieved by a cut-off trench which has either been tied to the rock or taken to&#13;
impervious strata. However, where it was not possible to provide a positive cut-off, extensive&#13;
grouting has been done and an impervious clay blanket provided on the upstream side to&#13;
minimize the possibility of seepage. The chimney drains will intercept seepage through the&#13;
dam body to keep the downstream slope free from seepage forces. The factors of safety of&#13;
slopes are adequate both under the static as well as seismic conditions. Relief wells are&#13;
provided on the downstream toes of the dams with piezometers between the relief wells.&#13;
9.     Spillways have an ogee cross-section with crest radial gates for impoundment as&#13;
well as releases and roller buckets for energy dissipation. The main body of spillways&#13;
consists of stone masonry with 1.5 m thick concrete facing on both sides anchored to the&#13;
masonry with dowels. Geotechnical investigations were made by geologists of the Geological&#13;
Survey of India who also helped in evaluating foundation treatment measures including the&#13;
pattern of consolidation and curtain grouting. A drainage grouting gallery has been provided&#13;
in the spillway body at Baghua, Upper Jonk and Hariharjore to provide internal drainage of&#13;
the structure and the foundation, and to check the development of uplift pressures. The&#13;
omission of this provision in the Hariharjore and Badanalla spillway designs is not a good&#13;
feature but nothing can be done now since the spillways are nearing completion; however,&#13;
deep inclined drainage holes will be drilled from the downstream face of the glacis at 3.0 m&#13;
spacing in addition to other measures for providing effective drainage.&#13;
10.    Dam Safety Review Panel. The Government of Orissa (GOO) has constituted a&#13;
Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) with the objectives of examining and reviewing the&#13;
adequacy of investigations, designs and construction of dams and related structures, and to&#13;
propose modifications needed to ensure safety and integrity. DSRP is functioning well and&#13;
had visited Harabhangi, Badanalla, Baghua and Upper Jonk dams at time of Appraisal, and&#13;
subsequently visited and reported on the other project sites. It has examined quality control&#13;
records and has found the overall designs and factors of safety to be adequate. With these&#13;
technical inputs and GOO's commitment to construction quality, the safety and integrity of&#13;
headworks should be ensured.&#13;
11.    Main Canal and Structures. The main and branch canals are mostly unlined&#13;
except in short reaches upstream and downstream of structures. The relevant Indian&#13;
Standards have been adopted for the design of unlined canals. A ratio of 4 to 5 has been kept&#13;
for bed width to depth as far as practicable. Protection and slope stability measures are being&#13;
provided on canal slopes (through stone masonry in suitable panels and catchwater drains), in&#13;
reaches with erodible and kaolinized soils, which are vulnerable to sloughing and slippages.&#13;
Designs of structures, including cross-drainage and regulating structures, conform to&#13;
acceptable design standards. Major structures have been designed for ease and efficiency of&#13;
operation and maintenance by isolating barrels in the multi-barrel aqueducts and providing of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 17&#13;
grooves for stoplogs in addition to service gates in head regulators, cross regulators and&#13;
escapes.&#13;
12.    Distributary and Minor Canals. DOWR has agreed to adopt continuous or&#13;
rotational water delivery below the level of a distributary or minor canal through ungated&#13;
proportional dividing structures. The conveyance system will be divided into two portions,&#13;
regulated and structured, at the level where the canal has a design capacity of about 2 m3/s&#13;
(or commands about 2,000 ha). The main and branch canals (above about 2 m3/s) will&#13;
constitute the regulated portion; distributaries, minors and watercourses (below 2 m3/s) will&#13;
be the structured portion. The main and branch canals will operate continuously throughout&#13;
the cropping season with full or less than full discharge but the distributary and minors will&#13;
either operate full or be dry depending on the crop water requirement, rainfall pattern and&#13;
water availability.&#13;
13.    The head regulator of a distributary will be a gated structure to pass the design&#13;
discharge at full supply level (FSL) in the main/branch canal. Adequate control or regulating&#13;
structures (duckbill weirs or cross regulators) will be provided in the main/branch canal to&#13;
maintain design FSL. Important regulation points will be manned and connected by radio&#13;
communication/telephone system.&#13;
14.    Below the head regulator of a distributary, there will be no gated structure. A&#13;
proportional distributor will be constructed at the head of each off-taking minor or subminor&#13;
and a semi-modular outlet (open flume or semi-modular orifice) at the head of each&#13;
watercourse. Provision of stoplog grooves will be made in the side masonry walls. The flow&#13;
in distributary and minor canals will be automatically subdivided into chak outlets&#13;
simultaneously without any manual gate operations. A standing wave flume will be provided&#13;
in the head reach of every distributary to measure flow. A distributary/minor will end into&#13;
two or more outlets in the form of a tail cluster. A gauge will be fixed at the tail for&#13;
monitoring flow. The water level at the tail gauge being at the design level is an indication&#13;
that the distributary is operating satisfactorily throughout its entire length. No direct outlet&#13;
will be allowed from a main/branch canal, as a matter of design principle. Such areas will be&#13;
clubbed with the upstream minor or a parallel minor will be constructed to irrigate this area.&#13;
15.    Chak and Watercourses. Within the chak, the entire flow of the watercourse will&#13;
be rotated between subchaks (each about 5 ha) and individual farm holdings by framing a&#13;
weekly time roster allocating a fixed time and duration to each subchak in proportion to its&#13;
area. Each farmer will be free to plant crops of his choice and make conjunctive use of&#13;
groundwater resources, if any.&#13;
16.    A well-defined operational plan or delivery schedule will be prepared well in&#13;
advance before the start of the irrigation season (kharif or rabi) in consultation with the&#13;
Agriculture Department and water users' associations (Apex Committees and Farmer&#13;
Councils). The available supplies will be released into the conveyance system to meet crop&#13;
water requirements of the predominant crops in all the critical stages of the plant growth from&#13;
pre-sowing to maturity.&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Page 6 of 17&#13;
Status of Design&#13;
17.    Survey and design for headworks (dams, spillways, dykes) is generally substantially&#13;
complete but some minor design changes have been agreed to take account of recent&#13;
recommendations of the DSRP. Design of earthworks for main, branch and distributary&#13;
canals are generally substantially complete. Designs of major structures for main and branch&#13;
canals are generally substantially complete except that, for some repetitive structures, existing&#13;
designs will need to be slightly adapted to suit the different location-specific conditions.&#13;
Sufficient designs for structures on distributaries and for all aspects of minors and subminors&#13;
have been completed to assess the likely cost of completing the works. Work on survey and&#13;
design of watercourses has only recently started.&#13;
Estimated Costs&#13;
18.    Costs, which are shown in detail in Annex 18, have been estimated in accordance&#13;
with the DOWR 1994/95 schedule of rates, with updating as appropriate based on analysis of&#13;
tenders received in 1994/95 compared with the 1994 schedule.&#13;
19.    Physical contingencies have been assumed to be 15% for civil works and 10% for&#13;
equipment and vehicles. No physical contingencies have been allowed for land acquisition,&#13;
technical assistance, training, engineering and administration.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
20.    ICB. Naraj barrage would be divided into two International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB) contracts: one for civil engineering works and one for gates, hoists and related electro-&#13;
mechanical equipment. It is not expected that there would be any other contracts under the&#13;
Scheme Completions component large enough to warrant ICB. The bid documents have been&#13;
received and approved by the Bank.&#13;
21.    NCB. Wherever practicable, other than at Naraj barrage, construction contracts&#13;
would be awarded following National Competitive Bidding (NCB). DOWR had prepared two&#13;
typical bid documents for civil works at appraisal, using the World Bank Standard Bidding&#13;
Document, one for contracts valued at less than Rs. 3 million and one for contracts valued at&#13;
more than Rs. 3 million. On the basis of approved models, bid documents for other works&#13;
have been prepared and reviewed as appropriate. Contracts for design, fabrication and&#13;
erection of spillway gates for Badanalla, Harabhangi, Hariharjore and Upper Jonk have&#13;
already been awarded. Detailed procurement schedules prepared by DOWR for each&#13;
subproject are shown in the Project Reports for each subproject.&#13;
B. RENGALI IRRIGATION SUBPROJECT&#13;
22.    Rengali dam on the Brahmani river is 71 m high with a catchment area of 25,250&#13;
km2 and forms a reservoir with a live storage of 3,414 million m3, some 23% of the mean&#13;
annual flow. Rengali dam was initially considered primarily as the means to provide flood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 7 of 17&#13;
relief for 2,600 km2 in the Brahmani delta but later provisions for power generation and&#13;
irrigation were included. The fifth and last 50 MW generating set was commissioned in&#13;
1992. A barrage has been constructed at Samal, 34 km downstream of the dam, to divert&#13;
water released from the powerhouse at Rengali darn, together with water from the&#13;
intermediate catchment of 4,780 kM2, to two main canals, construction of which has begun.&#13;
23.    The proposed subproject would involve the development of the first 8,483 ha, out of&#13;
the proposed 399,800 ha of irrigation. The predominant crops now grown in the subproject&#13;
area are paddy (about 73%) and pulses (24%) but average crop yields are quite low at about&#13;
2.25 t/ha and 0.5 t/ha respectively. Lack of irrigation water constrains agricultural production.&#13;
24.    Approval was given by GOO for development of 114,300 ha from a left bank canal&#13;
(LBC) on 24 July 1979 and for 121,200 ha from a right bank canal on 5 August 1981,&#13;
together known as the Phase I area. Approval for a possible Phase II area (164,300 ha) at the&#13;
downstream end of the left bank canal has not yet been given.&#13;
25.    Rengali dam was completed in 1985 and the downstream barrage at Samal is now&#13;
nearing completion. The dam (of composite masonry and concrete) is not included in WRCP.&#13;
The internal drainage system of the dam is becoming choked. Also, almost all instruments&#13;
provided in the dam body to monitor its structural behaviour are out of order. GOO has been&#13;
apprised of this and an action plan is to be initiated by the Government, including&#13;
commissioning of a specialized consultancy to rectify these problems and restore the dam to&#13;
good health in order to ensure long-term reliability and sustainability of both irrigation and&#13;
power. Funding is to be provided under the Dam Safety Project. Samal barrage, which is&#13;
560 m long, has 17 spillway bays with radial gates, each 20 m wide by 9.2 m high. In&#13;
addition, there are four similar undersluice bays on the left and three on the right. The&#13;
surface area of the pond formed by the barrage is about 2,888 ha. The average yield of water&#13;
from Samal barrage has been estimated to be 11,760 Mm3/yr; the 75% and 90% dependable&#13;
yields have been estimated to be 7,856 and 6,612 Mm3/yr respectively. About 3.7 million m3&#13;
of excavation, 2 regulators, 11 cross-drainage structures and 4 road bridges have been&#13;
constructed on the first 30 km of the left bank canal. Substantial excavation has also been&#13;
done for the first 12 km of right bank canal. Despite the major past investments in Rengali&#13;
Dam and Samal barrage, no irrigation water has yet been supplied from these works.&#13;
26.    Following a review by FAO/CP in November 1993 (see Working Paper 1, Report&#13;
No. 3/94 CP-IND 104 WPs dated 10 January 1994), it has been agreed by DOWR and IDA&#13;
that WRCP would include the completion of construction of Samal barrage and related works&#13;
and of the reach from km 0 to km 30 of the left bank main canal together with Parjang&#13;
distributary, minors, subminors, watercourses and other works necessary to provide reliable&#13;
gravity irrigation to a cultivable command area of 8,483 ha.&#13;
27.    Construction of the subproject works started in 1978 and a total of Rs. 1,825 million&#13;
has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last three years were Rs. 133,&#13;
131 and 78 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs. 133 million in 1992/93. The&#13;
main works required for the subproject include afflux and guide bunds and other works for&#13;
Samal barrage, about 3 km of the main canal (awaiting permission from the Department of&#13;

28.    Survey, investigation and design for the barrage and main LBC from km 0 to km 30&#13;
have been completed. Private land needed for 0 to 73 km of LBC, 0 to 60 km of RBC and 0&#13;
to 20 km of Parjang distributary has been acquired. Some forest land through which the&#13;
canal would pass has not yet been released by the Department of Forestry and the&#13;
Environment. Survey and design for sample areas of the distribution system have been&#13;
completed. Survey of India have completed topographical survey for the whole command&#13;
area and maps with contours at 2 m vertical interval are available. More detailed maps with&#13;
0.5 m contour interval are available for 54,000 ha. DOWR proposes to award a contract to&#13;
Indian consulting engineers for the survey, investigation and design of watercourses.&#13;
29.    The estimated cost of the outstanding works after 30 September 1994 for&#13;
construction of the subproject is Rs. 1,167 million based on the 1994 schedule of rates,&#13;
including an allowance of 10% for physical contingencies for Samal barrage where work is&#13;
well advanced and of 15% for physical contingencies on most other works. This cost&#13;
corresponds to about Rs. 138,000/ha (US$4,400/ha). If the cost of Samal barrage and the left&#13;
main canal are spread over the ultimate area to be irrigated, the cost of the WRCP reduces to&#13;
Rs. 46,700/ha (US$1,500/ha). The subproject area is near a heavily industrialised area,&#13;
Talcher, which provides a market for the high value crops that would be grown. There are&#13;
six divisions on site. Completion is expected in 2001.&#13;
30.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 15,000 tons of potatoes,&#13;
21,000 tons of paddy rice, 6,500 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 19,000 tons of vegetables,&#13;
1,100 tons of pulses and 37,000 tons of sugarcane. The estimated benefits are based on&#13;
assumptions that the cropping intensity would increase from the present 110% to 193% at full&#13;
development, there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop yields would increase due&#13;
to the availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs. Based on an&#13;
average farm size of 1.90 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase from the&#13;
current Rs. 10,300 to about Rs. 56,900 at full development. The value of aggregate&#13;
incremental production is estimated to be Rs. 183 million per year at full development. The&#13;
economic rate of return has been estimated at 21%.&#13;

C. MAHANADI-CHITROTPALA ISLAND SUBPROJECT&#13;
31.    The subproject comprises the construction of irrigation works to take water from the&#13;
existing Kendrapara canal to irrigate 15,342 ha on Mahanadi-Chitrotpala Island (MCI) and on&#13;
Paika-Mahanadi Island. Kendrapara canal is supplied from Mahanadi Barrage. Both islands&#13;
are protected by existing embankments on high land around their edges. The land slopes&#13;
inwards towards drains, which discharge to the main river through existing sluices near the&#13;
downstream ends of the islands. The downstream ends of Mahanadi-Chitrotpala Island and&#13;
Paika-Mahanadi Island have in the past suffered from flooding but this now happens seldom&#13;
due to construction of improved drainage and new sluices, which would be further improved&#13;
under the project.&#13;
32.    The predominant crops now grown in the subproject area are paddy (about 86% in&#13;
kharif) and pulses (48% in rabi) but average crop yields are quite low at about 1.7 t/ha and&#13;
0.8 t/ha respectively. Lack of irrigation water constrains agricultural production.&#13;
33.    Construction of the subproject works started in 1988/89 and a total of Rs.&#13;
290 million has been spent up to 31 December 1994. A length of about 10.4 km of the&#13;
Kendrapara canal, between km 1.65 and km 12.08 would be remodelled to increase the&#13;
capacity. A new link canal, 8.7 km long with a capacity of 27 m3/s, would be constructed&#13;
between the Kendrapara canal and an inverted syphon at Harichandanpur, 834 m long, which&#13;
is now under construction under the Chitrotpala river. Canals would be constructed along the&#13;
inside of the existing embankments, often using the embankment as one side of the canal.&#13;
All main, distributary, minor and subminor canals, field channels and on-farm development,&#13;
service roads, improved drainage and additional drainage sluices, would be constructed.&#13;
Provision of appropriate air relief valves and manholes has been made in the syphon for their&#13;
smooth operation and maintenance. The remodelling protion of Kendrapara Canal for a&#13;
length of 10.4 km and link canal for 8.6 km, are proposed to be lined with in-situ cement&#13;
concrete. These two canals, being situated in close proximity of the Mahanadi river, have&#13;
been provided with side slope of 2:1 from consideration of slope stability and 15 cm. sand&#13;
layer underneath the lining for satisfying the filter criteria. Adequate pressure relief valves&#13;
for effective release of pore pressure have also been provided.&#13;
34.    Construction of Chitrotpala syphon, Paika syphon and excavation of main canals for&#13;
33 km are in progress. Construction of canal syphon-cum-bridge across the Chitrotpala and&#13;
Paika rivers are, respectively, about 40% and 65% complete.&#13;
35.    The estimated cost after 31 December 1994 of completing the construction of the&#13;
subproject is Rs. 749 million in 1994 prices, including an allowance of about 15% for&#13;
physical contingencies. This corresponds to Rs. 50,000/ha (US$1,600/ha). There are three&#13;
civil and one mechanical division on site. Completion is expected by 2001.&#13;
36.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 29,000 tons of paddy rice,&#13;
14,606 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 184,080 tons of sugarcane, 11,505 tons of Irish potatoes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;

Page 10 of 17&#13;
and 16,000 tons of vegetables. The estimated benefits are based on assumptions that the&#13;
cropping intensity would increase from the present 178% to 196% at full development, that&#13;
there would be a shift to higher value crops, and that crop yields would increase due to the&#13;
availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs. Based on an average&#13;
farm size of 1.13 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase from the current Rs&#13;
11,300 to about Rs. 30,700 at full development. The value of aggregate incremental&#13;
production in economic prices is estimated to be Rs. 264 million at full development. The&#13;
economic rate of return has been estimated at 21%.&#13;
D. NARAJ BARRAGE SUBPROJECT&#13;
37.    The Mahanadi river, which is the largest river in Orissa, drains an area of 141,600&#13;
kM2, 93% of which is above the head of the Mahanadi delta at Naraj. At Naraj, the river&#13;
bifurcates into the Mahanadi and the Kathjori rivers. The area of the delta below Naraj is&#13;
about 9,000 kM2. In the 1860s, three weirs (Naraj, Mahanadi and Birupa) were constructed to&#13;
control levels and flows in the rivers downstream of Naraj. Naraj weir was built across the&#13;
Kathjori river between 1866 and 1874 in order to maintain adequate water level in the&#13;
Mahanadi branch to supply water to two irrigation systems, the headworks of which are&#13;
located about 8 km downstream of Naraj. At that point, the Mahanadi again bifurcates into&#13;
the Mahanadi and Birupa rivers. The Mahanadi and Birupa weirs were built between 1866&#13;
and 1883 across these two branches and for more than 100 years diverted water into irrigation&#13;
systems, with total cultivable command area of about 163,000 ha (known as the Stage I area)&#13;
before deterioration of the weir structures became severe. In 1980, an IDA Credit (Cr. 1078-&#13;
IN) for US$83 million was signed for the construction of two barrages just downstream of the&#13;
old Mahanadi and Birupa weirs. The credit closed in March 1990, three years later than&#13;
planned and was fully disbursed. The barrages have been completed to satisfactory&#13;
engineering standards with only minor work on the Mahanadi gantry outstanding.&#13;
38.    The Naraj weir, which is in Cuttack district, is now showing signs of distress; there&#13;
is appreciable seepage through the foundation, some erosion of the downstream face and&#13;
many irregularities in the weir profile. Serious damage caused by a heavy flood in 1982 was&#13;
quickly repaired but it is feared that another severe flood could destroy the weir. GOO&#13;
proposes to replace the weir with a barrage in order to: (a) prevent catastrophic failure of&#13;
Naraj weir which would result in a loss of irrigation in an area of about 183,000 ha in&#13;
Cuttack district and severe flooding in the area downstream of Naraj weir in Puri district, as&#13;
well as adverse environmental impact to Chilika Lake due to additional silt deposition and&#13;
negative impact on its brackish water content;'2' and (b) control flood flows in the Kathjori&#13;
so that flood damage, which at present occurs almost every year, would be avoided in about 9&#13;
years out of 10.&#13;
12' As discussed in the Environmental Assessment (SMEC/DOWR) of March 1995 (refer EA Executive Summary&#13;
at Annex 12) and further analyzed in the supplementary EA for Naraj barrage (Euroconsult/Delft&#13;
Hydraulics/DOWR) conducted in June 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 11 of 17&#13;
39.    Naraj Barrage would be located about 565 m downstream of the existing Naraj weir&#13;
across the Kathjori river in the Mahanadi delta. The barrage would be 940 m long between&#13;
abutments and would be designed for a flood of 29,500 m3/s (about 1 in 100 years&#13;
frequency). It would be very similar to the existing Mahanadi barrage and would have 28&#13;
spillway bays and 18 bays for flushing. Each bay would be 18 m wide with a vertical lift&#13;
steel gate. The barrage would include a 2 m wide fish pass and a 10.7 m wide road bridge,&#13;
which would provide road connection between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar via National&#13;
Highway 5. The barrage would require some 130,000 m3 of earthwork, 320,000 m3 of&#13;
concrete and 43,000 m2 of steel sheet piling. The location, layout, and waterway have been&#13;
finalized on the basis of detailed geotechnical studies of foundations revealed by subsoil&#13;
exploratory data through 29 boreholes and the hydraulic model studies carried out by Central&#13;
Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), Pune. Central Water Commission (CWC) is&#13;
the design consultant for the design of Naraj barrage and has issued specification drawings for&#13;
almost all the civil work components. DSRP has also critically reviewed and approved the&#13;
hydrology, layout, waterway and broad design aspects of the barrage. Bid documents for the&#13;
main civil engineering ICB contract have been prepared by DOWR and reviewed and cleared&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
40.    The cost of the proposed new barrage including physical contingencies has been&#13;
estimated at Rs. 1,412 million in March 1994 prices and the ERR at 24%. Completion is&#13;
expected in 2001. The subproject would not require the acquisition of land. Part of one&#13;
division is engaged on the work.&#13;
41.    The predominant crop now grown in the area that would benefit from the subproject&#13;
is paddy (about 97% in kharif and 24% in rabi). About 20% of the area grows pulses in rabi.&#13;
At present about 183,000 ha receives irrigation that would be affected by the failure of Naraj&#13;
weir. The benefits from the subproject would be as described in para 33.&#13;
E. BADANALLA SUBPROJECT&#13;
42.    A reservoir with a catchment area of 352 km2 now under construction on the&#13;
Badanalla River in the Vansadhara basin would form a 930 ha reservoir to provide live&#13;
storage of about 67 million m3 (some 45% of the mean annual flow of 150 million m3) to&#13;
enable an average of about 112 million m3 of water per year to be diverted from the reservoir&#13;
and used for irrigation of a cultivable command area (CCA) of 8,650 ha.&#13;
43.    The predominant crops now grown in the subproject area are paddy (about 85%) and&#13;
pulses (34% of the area) but average crop yields are quite low at about 1.5 t/ha and 0.5 t/ha&#13;
respectively. At present, about 2,000 ha receives run-of-the-river irrigation in the kharif&#13;
season from the subproject works but this is not reliable. Shortage of irrigation water&#13;
constrains agricultural production.&#13;
44.    Construction of the subproject works started in 1981 and a total of Rs 657 million&#13;
has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last three years were Rs75, 85&#13;
and 76 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs85 million in 1992/93. Progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;

has been severely constrained by lack of funds. The main works required for the subproject&#13;
include a 48 m high dam, 325 m long, three dykes with a combined length of 1,850 m and a&#13;
spillway 110 m long with 8 radial gates, each 8 m high and 12 m wide designed to pass a&#13;
peak flood flow of 3,934 m3/s. The dam is substantially complete but not yet storing water&#13;
because the spillway is only about 30% complete. Other works include 73 km of main and&#13;
branch canals (73% complete), 151 km of distributaries and minors (46%) and the following&#13;
structures:&#13;

45.    Designs of the headworks as well as earthworks for main, branch, distributary and&#13;
minor canals have been completed. Thirty-nine structures (out of 400) on the main and&#13;
branch canals remained to be designed and 201 out of 956 structures on distributaries&#13;
remained to be designed at appraisal, but the balance designs have since been largely&#13;
completed. Survey for watercourses has begun.&#13;
46.    A 600 kW hydroelectric power station is under construction at the head regulator of&#13;
the main canal.&#13;
47.    The estimated cost, after 30 September 1994, of completing the subproject under&#13;
Orissa WRCP is Rs. 420 million in 1994 prices including physical contingencies. This&#13;
corresponds to about Rs. 49,000 (US$1,500) per ha of CCA. There are two divisions on site.&#13;
Completion is expected by 1998/99.&#13;
48.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 3,200 tons of oilseed, 140&#13;
tons of chilies, 14,000 tons of paddy rice, 3,600 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 10,000 tons of&#13;
Irish potatoes, 12,000 tons of vegetables and 3,700 tons of sugarcane; this would be offset by&#13;
a drop of about 1,400 tons in the production of pulses. The estimated benefits are based on&#13;
assumptions that the cropping intensity would rise from the present 131% to 154% at full&#13;
development, there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop yields would increase due&#13;
to the availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs. Based on an&#13;
average farm size of 2.07 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase from the&#13;
current Rs 5,600 to about Rs41,400 at full development. The value of aggregate incremental&#13;
production in economic prices is estimated to be Rs136 million per year at full development.&#13;
The economic rate of return has been estimated at 23%.&#13;

F. HARABHANGI SUBPROJECT&#13;
49.    A reservoir with a catchment area of 504 km2 now under construction on the&#13;
Harabhangi River in the Vansadhara river basin would have a surface area at FSL of 1,215 ha&#13;
and provide live storage of about 120 million m3 (some 43% of the mean annual flow of 273&#13;
million m3) to enable an average of about 187 million m3 of water per year to be diverted&#13;
through a tunnel into the adjacent Padma/Rusikulya river basin for irrigation of 9,150 ha.&#13;
The predominant crops now grown in the subproject area are paddy (about 59%), pulses&#13;
(25%) and millet (33%), but average crop yields are quite low at about 2.1 t/ha, 0.2 and 0.5&#13;
t/ha respectively. Shortage of irrigation water constrains agricultural production.&#13;
50.    Construction of the subproject works started in 1979 and the dam is now&#13;
substantially complete but not yet impounding water because the spillway is only about 40%&#13;
complete and excavation and lining of the tunnel is still in progress. A total of Rs570 million&#13;
has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last three years were Rs71, 62&#13;
and 36 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs71 million in 1991/92. The main&#13;
works required for the subproject include a 49 m high dam, 690 m long and a spillway 117 m&#13;
long with 8 radial gates, each 9 m high and 12 m wide designed to pass a peak flood flow of&#13;
4608 m3/s. Other works include:&#13;

About 300 km of watercourses will be required.&#13;
51.    Water diverted through the tunnel would flow into the Padma River and be diverted&#13;
by a weir at Gokulpur into an irrigation network. Construction of the Gokulpur weir was&#13;
completed in 1991 and the irrigation network is about 60% complete. If water was available,&#13;
irrigation could be provided to outlets from minors/subminors for about 2,000 ha: this would&#13;
increase to about 3,000 ha on completion of ongoing contracts. However, outlet structures to&#13;
watercourses and the watercourses themselves have not yet been built. About 6,590 ha of the&#13;
area to be irrigated drains to Sorada reservoir. Return flows from this area would be reused&#13;
in the Rusikulya system. There is potential for generating about 120 GWh per year of&#13;
electricity if a series of seven small hydropower stations was constructed on the Padma River&#13;
between the tunnel inlet and Gokulpur weir. The costs and benefits of this are not included&#13;
in the subproject.&#13;
52.    The estimated cost, after 30 September 1994, of completing the subproject is&#13;
Rs450 million in 1994 prices including an allowance for physical contingencies. This&#13;
corresponds to about Rs49,000 (US$1,600) per ha of CCA irrigated from Gokulpur weir.&#13;
There are two divisions on site. Completion is expected by 1998 but this depends on&#13;
accelerating work on the tunnel.&#13;

53.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 16,000 tons of paddy rice,&#13;
5,500 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 7,600 tons of Irish potatoes, 27,000 tons of vegetables,&#13;
500 tons of pulses and 19,800 tons of sugarcane; this would be offset by a drop of about&#13;
1,100 tons in the production of millet. The estimated benefits are based on assumptions that&#13;
the cropping intensity would increase from the present 122% to 193% at full development,&#13;
there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop yields would increase due to the&#13;
availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs. Based on an average&#13;
farm size of 1.70 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase from the current&#13;
Rs5,950 to about Rs37,000 at full development. The value of aggregate incremental&#13;
production has been estimated in economic prices at Rs148 million per year at full&#13;
development. Based on the benefits obtained from the 9,150 ha directly irrigated from&#13;
Gokulpur weir and the benefits from return flows into Sorada reservoir in rabi, but ignoring&#13;
costs incurred up to September 1994, the ERR of the subproject is estimated to be 21%.&#13;
G. HARIHARJORE SUBPROJECT&#13;
54.    A reservoir with a catchment area of 425 km2 under construction on the Hariharjore&#13;
river in the Mahanadi river basin would provide live storage of 59 Mm3, 40% of the mean&#13;
annual flow in the river of 145 Mm3, for irrigation of a cultivable command area of 9,450 ha.&#13;
Planning Commission approval was obtained in 1978 and construction started in 1978/79. A&#13;
total of Rs434 million has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last&#13;
three years were Rsl6, 30 and 28 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs3O&#13;
million in 1992/93. The predominant crop now grown in the subproject area is paddy (about&#13;
86%), but average crop yield is quite low at about 1.4 t/ha. The 75% reliable flow at the&#13;
dam site has been estimated to be 137 Mm3/yr, which should be adequate to supply the&#13;
estimated crop water requirement for the subproject area of 95 Mm3/yr. At present about&#13;
1,000 ha receives irrigation but this is not reliable. Shortage of irrigation water constrains&#13;
agricultural production.&#13;
55.     The main works required for the subproject include a 18.5 m high dam, 2,424 m&#13;
long including a spillway 128 m wide with 9 radial gates, each 6 m high and 12 m wide&#13;
designed to pass a peak flood flow of 2,855 m3/s. Earthworks for main, branch and&#13;
distributary canals are substantially complete and for minors approximately 46% of the 81 km&#13;
are complete. Other works include:&#13;

The headworks are about 85% complete and the distribution system about 69%.&#13;
56.    The estimated cost, after 30 September 1994, of completing the subproject is Rs235&#13;
million in 1994 prices, including an allowance for physical contingencies. This corresponds&#13;
to about Rs25,000 (US$790) per ha. There are two divisions on site. Completion is expected&#13;
in 1999.&#13;
57.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 1,100 tons of mnillet/maize,&#13;
700 tons of mustard, 6,000 tons of paddy rice, 3,500 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 3,500 tons&#13;
of Irish potatoes, 5,600 tons of vegetables and 2,200 tons of pulses. The estimated benefits&#13;
are based on assumptions that the cropping intensity would increase from the present 95% to&#13;
145% at full development, there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop yields would&#13;
increase due to the availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs.&#13;
Based on an average farm size of 1.74 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase&#13;
from the current Rs2,800 to about RsI9,900 at full development. The value of aggregate&#13;
incremental production in economic prices has been estimated to be Rs87 million per year at&#13;
full development. The economic rate of return has been estimated at 27%.&#13;
H. UPPER JONK SUBPROJECT&#13;
58.    A reservoir with a surface area of 1,085 ha at FSL and a catchment area of 342 km2&#13;
now under construction on the Jonk river in the Mahanadi river basin would provide live&#13;
storage of about 64.5 million m3 (about 53% of the mean annual flow of 120.6 million rn3) to&#13;
irrigate 9,425 ha, including 810 ha in Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
59.    Construction of the headworks began in 1980 and about 95% of the earth dam, 10%&#13;
of the spillway and about 60% of the distribution system have been completed. A total of&#13;
Rs509 million has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last three years&#13;
were Rs86, 75 and 89 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs89 rmillion in&#13;
1993/94. The predominant crops now grown in the subproject area are paddy (about 48%),&#13;
groundnuts (22%) and pulses (15%) but average crop yields are quite low at about 1 t/ha,&#13;
0.85 and 0.6 t/ha respectively. At present, about 4,000 ha receives run-of-the-river irrigation&#13;
in kharif but this is not reliable. Shortage of irrigation water constrains agricultural&#13;
production. The main works required for the subproject include a 25 m high earth dam, 647&#13;

construction with 7 radial gates, each 8.5 m high and 12 m wide designed to pass a peak&#13;
flood flow of 3,555 m3/s. Other works include about 44 km of main canals and about 147&#13;

Progress has been seriously restrained by lack of funds.&#13;
60.    The estimated cost, after 30 September 1994, of completing the subproject is about&#13;
Rs493 million in 1994 prices, including an allowance for physical contingencies. This&#13;
corresponds to Rs49,600 per ha (US$1,600/ha). There are two divisions on site. Completion&#13;
is expected by 1999.&#13;
61.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 100 tons of mustard,&#13;
16,000 tons of paddy rice, 1,200 tons of unshelled groundnuts, 80 tons of wheat, 13,600 tons&#13;
of vegetables and 300 tons of pulses. The estimated benefits are based on assumptions that&#13;
the cropping intensity would increase from the present 97% to 138% at full development,&#13;
there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop yields would increase due to the&#13;
availability of irrigation water and increased use of agricultural inputs. Based on an average&#13;
farm size of 1.26 ha, net annual farm income from crops would increase from the current&#13;
Rs4,000 to about RsI4,800 at full development. The value of aggregate incremental&#13;
production in economic prices has been estimated to be Rs108 million per year at full&#13;
development. The economic rate of return has been estimated at 19%.&#13;
I. BAGHUA STAGE II SUBPROJECT&#13;
62.    Stage I of this scheme, which was completed in 1980, comprised the construction of&#13;
a weir on the Baghua River in the Rusikulya river basin and the distribution system on the&#13;
left bank for 3,000 ha. Under Stage II, it is proposed to construct a reservoir upstream of the&#13;
weir and a new irrigation system for a proposed CCA of 5,000 ha on the right bank, which&#13;
would also supply water to the existing weir and thence to the left bank area. However, the&#13;
total area proposed for irrigation in kharif is only 6,400 ha, 3,000 ha of which is already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 17 of 17&#13;
receiving irrigation from the weir and 2,400 ha in rabi. The incremental irrigated area would&#13;
therefore be 3,240 ha in kharif and 2,400 ha in rabi. The predominant crops now grown in&#13;
the subproject area are paddy (about 51%), maize (26%) and pulses (26%) but average crop&#13;
yields are quite low at about 1.3 t/ha, 0.5 and 0.5 t/ha respectively. At present, about 3,000&#13;
ha receives run-of-the-river irrigation in kharif but this is not reliable. Shortage of irrigation&#13;
water constrains agricultural production.&#13;
63.    A reservoir under construction on the Baghua river has a catchment area of 171 km2.&#13;
This includes a subcatchment of 21 km2 which has already been developed; this has been&#13;
omitted in calculating water availability which is based on an assumed catchment areas of 150&#13;
km2 (2.3 times the total CCA of 6,400 ha). The live storage in the reservoir would be 31&#13;
Mm3, 49% of the mean annual flow of 63.7 Mm3. Planning Commission approval was&#13;
obtained in 1978. Construction of the subproject works started in 1988/89 and a total of&#13;
Rs192 million has been spent up to 30 September 1994. Expenditures in the last three years&#13;
were Rs3O, 40 and 35 million respectively. The peak expenditure was Rs4O million in&#13;
1992/93. The headworks are about 10% complete and the distribution system about 31%.&#13;
64.    The main works required for the subproject include earth dam about 18 m high and&#13;
dykes with a total length of 1,460 m and a spillway 140 m long with 6 radial gates, each 6 m&#13;
high and 12 m wide designed to pass a peak flood flow of 2,227 m3/s. Other works include:&#13;

About 135 km of watercourses will be required.&#13;
65.    The estimated cost, after 30 September 1994, of completing the subproject is Rs343&#13;
million in 1994 prices, including an allowance for physical contingencies. This corresponds&#13;
to Rs55,000 (US$1,700) per ha for the full area of 6,248 ha or RslO6,000/ha (US$3,400/ha)&#13;
for the incremental area. There is one division on site. Completion is targeted for 1998.&#13;
66.    The increase in annual agricultural production, five years after the completion of the&#13;
subproject (full development), has been estimated to include about 2,900 tons of millet/maize,&#13;
3,500 tons of paddy rice, 4,200 tons of unshelled groundnuts and 400 tons of pulses; this&#13;
would be offset by a drop of about 3,000 tons in the production of sugarcane. The estimated&#13;
benefits are based on assumptions that the cropping intensity would increase from the present&#13;
128% to 142% at full development, there would be a shift to higher value crops and crop&#13;
yields would increase due to the availability of irrigation water and increased use of&#13;
agricultural inputs. Based on an average farm size of 1.15 ha, net annual farm income from&#13;
crops would increase from the current Rs5,200 to about RsI4,200 at full development. The&#13;
value of aggregate incremental production in economic prices has been estimated to be Rs56&#13;
million per year at full development. The economic rate of return has been estimated at 17%.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Water Resources Research Fund&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The OWRCP's investments provide Orissa the opportunity to establish and build-up&#13;
modernized institutional capability in key technical and managerial areas. To ensure full&#13;
utilization of this opportunity and its perpetuation beyond the OWRCP period, the Government of&#13;
Orissa (GOO) will want to instill in DOWR a culture of learning and innovation, and receptivity&#13;
to technological advances outside DOWR in Orissa's non-governmental sector, or from elsewhere&#13;
in India and overseas. The Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF) will provide GOO a&#13;
mechanism for catalyzing change and seeking innovation in the water sector through: (i) funding&#13;
on a grant basis carefully screened and approved research and technology transfer proposals from&#13;
Orissan research or technology entities; (ii) active encouragement of collaboration between an&#13;
Orissan and other Indian or international organization; and (iii) fostering linkages between&#13;
DOWR and academic institutions in both the private and public sectors. The WRRF is&#13;
deliberately formulated to be flexible in orientation to allow for adaptation as DOWR's&#13;
knowledge and awareness of worldwide expertise and best practices grows, and as the needs and&#13;
objectives of the Orissa's water sector evolve.&#13;
Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF)&#13;
The Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF) will fulfill an essential need under Orissa's&#13;
program to modernize management, planning and development of its water and land resources. A&#13;
specified amount of the total credit allocation for the WRCP will be earmarked to fund high&#13;
quality applied research and technology transfer activities relevant to Orissa's present and future&#13;
water sector. The WRRF objective will be to:&#13;
i)    promote the culture of applied research among irrigation professionals in the field;&#13;
ii)   identify and support applied and problem solving research, specifically addressed&#13;
to land and water production and sustainability in the irrigation sector, especially at&#13;
the river basin level;&#13;
iii)   promote research on social issues, such as farmer's and women's and&#13;
disadvantaged groups participation in field level activities and decision making for&#13;
better management; and&#13;
iv)   promote cooperation between DOWR and research institutions from Orissa, India,&#13;
and overseas.&#13;
Organizational Framework.&#13;
The WRRF would be administered by a project officer in the office of the Engineer in&#13;
Chief. The project officer would convene quarterly meetings, in consultation with the EIC and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -                              Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
the Research Advisory Committee (RAC). He will prepare the invitation, circulate proposals and&#13;
the agenda to the committee members.&#13;
The Research Advisory Committee (RAC) would be established to ensure the quality, and&#13;
the applied nature of the research and to advise the Engineer in Chief on research projects. The&#13;
RAC would not have administrative responsibilities but provide scientific and professional advice&#13;
to DOWR on research matters. The RAC would review research proposals for their quality and&#13;
relevance, assess the capability of each applicant to carry out the research, advise on modifications&#13;
to the proposal as needed, review the proposed cost submitted by the applicant, monitor the&#13;
research progress and suggest mid term corrections if necessary. Based on the number of&#13;
received proposals, the RAC would recommend a priority list of proposals to the EIC (DOWR)&#13;
who would make the final decision on selection, priority and funding. The RAC would also take a&#13;
proactive role in identifying and promoting problem solving research and technology transfers in&#13;
the water sector of the state.&#13;
The RAC would consist of not more than five experts with outstanding capabilities in the&#13;
following areas of specialty:&#13;
i)    water resource/hydraulic engineering,&#13;
ii)    agricultural science,&#13;
iii)   environmental science,&#13;
iv)    economics and social science,&#13;
v)    other areas of relevance.&#13;
The members of the RAC would present a mixture of those with practical experience and those&#13;
with academic experience and at least one member with experience in the urban and industrial&#13;
sector. Members should not include active govemment staff or be actively employed by any of&#13;
the institutions eligible for funding. Members would be appointed by the EIC.&#13;
Methodology.&#13;
The RAC would have the following responsibilities:&#13;
i)    organize workshops with participation from reputed universities, including&#13;
agricultural universities, individual researchers, as well as water users, and identify&#13;
problems relevant to Orissa's water use and to specific river basins;&#13;
ii)   identify problem areas based on their experience and critical review of water and&#13;
river basin issues;&#13;
iii)   short-list research proposals and identify researchers and institutions for support;&#13;
iv)    publicly advertise and invite research proposals from within the state as well as&#13;
conjunctive research of state institutions with either Indian or overseas institutions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
v)    review the research and special study program of DOWR under the responsibility&#13;
of WALMI; and&#13;
vi)   submit its recommendations to the EIC, DOWR.&#13;
Research proposals emanating from the different streams suggested above would be&#13;
considered by the RAC, and discussed in detail with the applicants. A two stage application&#13;
process will be adopted. The first stage will provide the RAC the opportunity of screening&#13;
relatively brief proposals, and giving feedback to promising applicants on content, scope or&#13;
methodology of proposed research. The second stage will involve review of detailed research&#13;
plans requested of applicants whose proposals passed the initial screening stage. The proposed&#13;
research should normally be no longer than 2 years duration, with a possible extension to a third&#13;
year. In exceptional cases the research could continue for a fourth and final year.&#13;
Each proposal should include a background and needs statement, and provide full&#13;
justification of estimated costs, e.g. laboratory equipment, salary of research scholars, research&#13;
assistants, enumerators, etc., recurring costs for chemicals, glassware, etc., costs of&#13;
demonstrations and pilot plants, travel costs including national and international travels but&#13;
excluding the purchase of vehicles, participation in seminars and workshops, and contingencies.&#13;
Research plans would expand on the proposals to include: detailed literature search outlining&#13;
available knowledge; research objectives and detailed methodology; identification of expected&#13;
beneficiaries of research findings; staffing needs by specialty; CVs of key researchers to be&#13;
involved in the work; evaluation procedures or arrangements for independent review by experts&#13;
and/or beneficiaries of research findings; and detailed cost estimates and implementation schedule&#13;
by research work item.&#13;
The WRRF suggests priority research topics in Orissa such as:&#13;
i)    cross-sectoral (municipal, industrial, agricultural etc.) issues in water management&#13;
and planning;&#13;
ii)    hydrology, system design and engineering;&#13;
iii)    water resource allocation, water markets and water prices;&#13;
iv)    ground water regulation and pricing;&#13;
v)    basin management and basin planning,&#13;
vi)   farmer and local participation in water management and system turnover;&#13;
vii)   water efficient irrigation systems; and&#13;
viii)  environmental impacts of irrigation, drainage, urban and industrial use.&#13;
Research proposals submitted to the WRRF have to originate from research and related&#13;
institutions located in Orissa. However, the WRRF actively encourages research proposals jointly&#13;
prepared by research institutions from Orissa with other Indian or overseas institutions. Such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

conjunctive research facilitates the transfer of technologies and expertise from abroad to further&#13;
improve the water sector.&#13;
Financing. IDA funding of the WRRF under the WRCP would cover 100% of the grants&#13;
awarded by the EIC and 100% of honoraria of the RAC and other reasonable RAC costs.&#13;
Disbursement would be against expenditures on contracts or against certificates of expenditures&#13;
under such contracts. To enable the progressive build-up of a permanent fund, GOO would&#13;
provide matching grants to an interest earning account for the WRRF with contributions to the&#13;
account made quarterly equivalent to one-third of IDA disbursements in the preceding quarter.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM&#13;
Agricultural Intensification Program&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Agricultural Intensification Program (AIP) would complement the irrigation&#13;
irnprovements funded under the OWRCP with parallel efforts to improve farmer's agricultural&#13;
practices. With reliable and timely water delivery, agriculture can be significantly intensified. The&#13;
capability of the extension service to transmit innovatory advice to farmers would, however, need&#13;
upgrading. At present, budgetary constraints hamper the quality of the Department of&#13;
Agriculture's (DOA) extension services, by limiting the mobility of staff (particularly of Subject&#13;
Matter Specialists) between headquarters and the field, and forestalling provision of on-farm&#13;
demonstrations and applied research. It also restricts DOA's internal training program and its&#13;
collaboration with related training and research providers (such as WALMI, the Orissa University&#13;
of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) and the Central Rice Research University (CRRU)).&#13;
2.    The AIP would fund activities to enhance the quality of extension services in irrigated&#13;
commands, including adaptive research and field demonstrations in key areas of water&#13;
management and irrigated agronomy. The AIP would pull together initiatives of DOA, WALMI,&#13;
OUAT and CRRU to strengthen agricultural development services, provide specialized irrigation&#13;
agronomy and water management courses, and disseminate the extension messages to the farmers.&#13;
Field implementation would center on farmer organizations, including the use of "Apex&#13;
Committee Centers" as fulcrums for contact, training and demonstrations.&#13;
Implementation Through Farmer Organizations and Apex Committee Centers&#13;
3.    The cornerstone of the field implementation of the AIP will be through farmer water user&#13;
associations and their "Apex Committees". Commands with successfully operating "Apex&#13;
Committees" would be provided by DOWR with a simple building or "Apex Committee Center"&#13;
comprising a large multi-purpose room and four small offices. The objective of the Centers&#13;
would be multi-purpose:&#13;
*  To provide a center for meetings of Apex Committees to foster communication and&#13;
interaction among farmers in the command areas;&#13;
* To provide space and equipment for multi-purpose farmer training;&#13;
* To encourage and provide the means for regular communication between farmers and&#13;
government staff (DO WR, DOA, Agricultural Engineering, etc.);&#13;
* To encourage field level communication, through close proximity, of DOWR and&#13;
agricultural extension staff, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
* To act as centers for adaptive agronomic research, field trials and demonstrations, and&#13;
for connections with marketing agencies and input and equipment suppliers.&#13;
In addition to the main meeting/training room, these centers would accommodate an office each&#13;
for DOWR, DOA, the Apex Committee and an extra office for possible marketing tie-ups. Basic&#13;
furnishings and equipment would be provided for demonstrations and training.&#13;
4.    The AIP and its Apex Committee Center program would start on a pilot scale and&#13;
progressively build up as experience is gained. For the first two years, four commands have been&#13;
chosen, as described in para 19. Thereafter, using lessons learned in the first two years, four to&#13;
five new Centers are targeted to be established annually as the OWRCP's Farmer Organization an&#13;
Turnover (FOT)Program builds up. Actual progress will depend on the success of the pilot&#13;
program and the build-up of the FOT program. If proceeding to schedule, some 25 Apex Centers&#13;
would be established by PY6, covering most of the OWRCP commands.&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
Training&#13;
5.    All phases of AIP will require substantial training inputs, broad details of which are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
6.    Training of agricultural extension staff to upgrade their professional competence in&#13;
irrigated farming and of farmers in water management, fertilizer application, crop planning, plant&#13;
protection, farm mechanization and post harvest technology is presently being organized by&#13;
OAUT, WALMI and CRRU. There is need for the three institutions undertaking training to&#13;
collaborate to strengthen agricultural development services by providing specialized courses in&#13;
irrigation agronomy and water management to DOA staff at all levels including for the training of&#13;
trainers. The nodal department for undertaking such training will be WALMI which will draw&#13;
experts in various fields from the three institutions and from outside.&#13;
7.    At command levels, the training of farmers and most of the extension staff will normally be&#13;
organized at the Apex Center, although facilities at the above three institutions will also be used.&#13;
All extension staff including senior officers, members of Apex Committee, Farmers Councils and&#13;
Outlet Committees will be given initial orientation training in OWRCP concepts, and the role of&#13;
the different functionaries involved in AIP. This will be followed by training of extension staff&#13;
and farmers in various aspects of irrigated agriculture.&#13;
8.    Each Apex Center will be equipped with necessary facilities to organize such training&#13;
programs, seminars and workshops:&#13;
* basic furnishings (chairs, tables, etc.);&#13;
* audio-visual aids (television set, video cassette recorder, video and ordinary camera,&#13;
overhead projector, slide projector);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
* basic library facilities and teaching aids (posters, charts, slides, bulletins, journals, and&#13;
publications on irrigated agronomy, etc.); and&#13;
* Minibus for transport of farmers to demonstrations and use by subject matter&#13;
specialists (para 10).&#13;
Training opportunities in irrigated agriculture agronomy for agriculture scientists and subject&#13;
matter specialists will also be provided in reputed universities and organizations both within and&#13;
outside India.&#13;
Technical assistance&#13;
9.    A full time consultant experienced in irrigation management will work directly with the&#13;
Director of Agriculture in the DOA. Specific to the AIP, he will coordinate agricultural extension&#13;
services to the farming community and the development of packages of agricultural practices.&#13;
These would be based on the results of adaptive research of OUAT. The consultant would assist&#13;
farmers in use of improved agricultural implements to accelerate the speed of farming operations&#13;
(e.g. land preparation, transplanting, and de-weeding in the case of paddy, sugarcane ridging,&#13;
spraying of insecticides), and also with technology to improve the quality of harvesting operations&#13;
(e.g. power threshing and groundnut decortication). The AIP will support the appointment of this&#13;
consultants.&#13;
Extension Services&#13;
10.   With the formation of farmer organizations, the interaction with farmers to disseminate&#13;
water use and crop production technologies can be organized through farmer groups rather than&#13;
through contact farmers as is being done at present. This will enable DOA and CADA staff to&#13;
improve their capacity to outreach farmers and provide accessible field demonstrations and&#13;
enhanced impact from extension services. Existing staff from DOA and CADA will be re-&#13;
allocated to enable adequate focus on OWRCP commands:&#13;
* Village Agriculture Workers (VAWs). VAWs will be primarily responsible for&#13;
providing extension services to farmers. The work of VAWs will be supervised by&#13;
agriculture officers, subject matter specialists in agronomy and plant protection,&#13;
additional district agricultural officers, and district agricultural officers.&#13;
* Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs). An SMS for water management will be provided&#13;
in OWRCP commands by redeployment from the existing state wide cadre of 16 SMSs&#13;
specialized in water management.&#13;
* CADA Staff. The existing staff of the Command Area Development Agency (CADA)&#13;
will, in addition to assisting the farmers in the alignment of water courses, field&#13;
channels and field drains, provide advice in on-farm water management.&#13;
11.   Transport Facilities. The mobility of VAWs and SMS in water management has been a&#13;
serious constraint in providing timely services to the farmers. The mobility of VAWs would be&#13;
enhanced by providing them bank loans on attractive terms to induce them to buy motorcycles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
and mopeds. The mobility of SMSs in water management will be improved by providing a&#13;
minibus at each Apex Center. The minibus will be used for transportation of farmers, office&#13;
bearers of the farmer organizations and the SMS, DOWR and other staff.&#13;
Adaptive Research and Field Demonstrations&#13;
12.   The responsibilities of OUAT and DOA will include taking a proactive role in identifying&#13;
and promoting problem solving research and technology transfer in the water sector and irrigation&#13;
agronomy. Broad water management and irrigated agronomy issues requiring refinements&#13;
through adaptive research programs by OUAT would include but not be limited to:&#13;
*  Economic use of irrigation water through efficient management of rainfall, ground&#13;
water and irrigation;&#13;
*  Development of sufficient land and water management practices to spread irrigation&#13;
water uniformly for lands of varying slope and plot sizes;&#13;
*  Crop choices linked to available water that can enable farmers to obtain higher level of&#13;
farm incomes; and&#13;
*  Any other item linked to improvement of water use efficiency and generation of higher&#13;
levels of farm incomes.&#13;
13.   The effectiveness of such research would depend upon farmers' abilities to best use the&#13;
related agricultural practices to intensify their agriculture production and increase their farm&#13;
income. The responsibility of DOA will be to develop sound and innovatory packages of&#13;
practices based on the results of such research. DOA will conduct on-farm demonstrations or on-&#13;
farm technology testing of various crops under scheme specific irrigation conditions. Research&#13;
trials and demonstrations will normally be organized over about 15 hectare areas in select&#13;
commands, each plot normally not exceeding 5 hectares in area. The total cost of conducting&#13;
adaptive research is estimated at Rs. 8000 per hectare spread over a period of three years.&#13;
14.   The DOA will conduct on-farm demonstrations in about 5 hectare areas to train farmers in&#13;
practical skills and promote the use of research findings in the development of proper package of&#13;
agricultural practices for adoption by the farmers. Normally, such demonstrations will be three to&#13;
four in a command covering about 15 hectares area. The estimated cost of each such&#13;
demonstration is about Rs. 3000 per hectare.&#13;
Input and Equipment Marketing Linkages.&#13;
15.   The Apex Centers would also be used to hire and sell farm implements, machinery and&#13;
other equipment needed by the farmers to economize on labor intensive agricultural operations&#13;
and to control pest and disease incidence. The State Agricultural Engineering wing of the&#13;
Directorate of Agriculture have over the years developed many useful and economical farm&#13;
implements and has recently intensified manufacturing and sales promotion program in farm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;

implements. A list of such implements recommended by the Engineering directorate for use by&#13;
farmers in irrigated commands along with their latest ex-factory price is given below:&#13;
1. Transplanter/Multi crop seed drill  Rs. 5,000&#13;
2. Weeder                              Rs. 450&#13;
3. Power thresher                      Rs. 8,000&#13;
4. Power winnower                      Rs. 6,000&#13;
5. Pedal thresher                      Rs. 3,000&#13;
6. Ground nut decorticator             Rs. 800&#13;
7. Ground nut digger                   Rs. 2,000&#13;
8. Sugarcane ridger                    Rs. 1,000&#13;
9. H.C. Sprayer                        Rs. 1,600&#13;
A few sets of the above categories of implements will be stocked at the center in numbers&#13;
sufficient to service about 3 5 hectares per day. The total estimated cost of such a set for each&#13;
center is about Rs. 100,000. The agricultural engineering wing of the DOA will demonstrate and&#13;
assist the farmers in the proper use of the equipment.&#13;
16.   Facilities to sell agricultural inputs through authorized input dealers/distributors and credit&#13;
supply through commercial banks will also be promoted by providing suitable space within the&#13;
center premises or at a suitable location close to the center. Marketing and processing of&#13;
agriculture produce through private entrepreneurs/farmer consortiums and reputed industrial&#13;
concerns will be supported by the center in collaboration with related government departments. A&#13;
provision of Rs. 100,000 has been made as seed money for each center to promote marketing tie-&#13;
ups with industries/private entrepreneurs/farmer consortiums.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
17.   The AIP would be funded through DOWR. Responsibility for implementation of the AIP&#13;
will primarily be with DOA. A special cell will be established in the DOA to assist the Director of&#13;
Agriculture to supervise and monitor the implementation of ALP. The cell will be headed by a full&#13;
time consultant advisor as described in para 9. Coordination of the different agencies involved&#13;
(DOA, DOWR and its WALMI, CADA, OUAT, and CRRU) would be through a special multi-&#13;
disciplinary committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary DOWR, with members from all&#13;
the above agencies.&#13;
Costs&#13;
18.   The total estimated base cost of the program spread over six years is Rs. 82.21 million.&#13;
The details of the cost of the component and its implementation are given in the attached table.&#13;
IDA funds under the OWRCP will be provided for funding of construction of Apex Committee&#13;
Centers and other facilities, equipment, furnishings and materials for Apex Centers, vehicles and&#13;
motorcycle/moped loans, costs of research and demonstrations, material, equipment and other&#13;
associated costs related to the AIP's training programs, consultancies, and India or overseas study&#13;
tours and training. GOO will finance all staff salaries, vehicle and building operations and&#13;
maintenance and other overheads.&#13;

Phasing&#13;
19.   The AIP will be concentrated in 4 of the 25 SIFT commands during the first two years of&#13;
the project (Rushikulya distributaries 2 and 11, Ghodahada, and Derjang, covering a total&#13;
command of about 20,000 hectares). During this piloting phase, paralleled by intensive staff&#13;
training, all aspects of the program and the benefits will be intensively monitored by DOWR and&#13;
DOA. Based on the lessons learned during these years, the program will be suitably modified and&#13;
gradually expanded to cover other commands. During the 6 years of the project period, AIP is&#13;
expected to cover all the rehabilitated/modernized commands of 25 schemes covering about&#13;
265,400. As the program gains momentum, it can be extended to new schemes where farmer&#13;
organizations are established and water deliveries are reliable.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Action Plan&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The primary objectives of the WRCP's Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) is to provide a record of tangible and sustainable gain for the WRCP project affected&#13;
peoples (PAPs), including the special needs of tribals, and also to establish permanent capability&#13;
and state-wide experience for handling all future R&amp;R in Orissa's water sector. The project's R&amp;R&#13;
component would thus have benefits going well beyond the specific needs related to the WRCP&#13;
investments. In preparation for the WRCP, two major initiatives were taken by the Govemment of&#13;
Orissa (GOO). On the policy front, a comprehensive Orissa State R&amp;R Policy was issued in&#13;
1994. Secondly, an institutional structure was established to handle R&amp;R in the water sector. The&#13;
WRCP's R&amp;R Action Plan incorporates these and other features highlighted below:&#13;
(a) promulgation of the new State R&amp;R Policy to ensure that persons affected by land&#13;
acquisition for water resources projects are restored to their former living standard or better;&#13;
(b) strengthening of the new institutional structure in the Department of Water Resources&#13;
Department (DOWR) to handle R&amp;R;&#13;
(c) expansion of the definition of project affected persons (PAPs) to include, unmarried&#13;
daughters thirty years or older, widows with no source of income, sharecroppers and&#13;
encroachers, and the landless;&#13;
(d) improved entitlements to project affected persons (PAPs) and enhancement of the&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance assistance to help restore incomes, including targeting of&#13;
existing government programs and other poverty alleviation schemes for specific benefit of&#13;
PAPs;&#13;
(e) provision for the specific needs of tribals, based on the Indigenous People's&#13;
Development Plans (IPDPs) (refer Annex 11);&#13;
(f) assistance provided by non-govemment organizations (NGOs)for&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(g) monitoring and evaluation including evaluations of development impact&#13;
by independent consultants to enable adjustments and corrections as needed&#13;
during implementation.&#13;
For each field site involving PAPs, a detailed socio-economic survey has been undertaken covering&#13;
all PAPs. On this basis, a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP! has been prepared&#13;
for each field site which will form the detailed basis for implementation of R&amp;R. Socio-economic&#13;
surveys, R&amp;R Action Plans, and IPDPs have been prepared for each project site, providing details&#13;
by site and by family/PAP, and are in separate supporting documentation. The RAPs will be&#13;
supplemented by Indigenous People's Development Plans (IPDPs) (refer Annex 11). also prepared&#13;
for each site. The WRCP will provide the full support required to implement the RAPs and&#13;
IPDPs. Project support will also be provided for training assistance, underway since 1994, and&#13;
consultancies for implementation, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E).&#13;

risks. The R&amp;R Action Plan Matrix is at Attachment 1. The Implementation Schedule is at&#13;
Attachment 2. The new Institutional Structure for R&amp;R is at Attachment 3. Attachment 4 provides&#13;
summary data on the extent of Land Acquisition and Attachment 5 on Project Affected Persons.&#13;
Attachment 6 summarizes the fisheries income-generating scheme. Finally, Attachment 7 provides&#13;
Monitorable Indicators of R&amp;R Progress and Impact.&#13;
3.    The Orissa R&amp;R policy which includes procedural, entitlement, institutional, and other&#13;
measures described in the action plan was approved under Government Order No.25296 on&#13;
August 27, 1994 and will be the basis for implementation of the R&amp;R component of the WRCP&#13;
project. A copy of Orissa's 1994 R&amp;R Policy is provided in separate supporting documentation.&#13;
B.    BACKGROUND AND PAST PERFORMANCE&#13;
4.    Orissa is a state rich in water resources and has the potential for substantial water resources&#13;
development for irrigation and other uses. The majority of this can be achieved through&#13;
investments in major and medium surface irrigation schemes (a major scheme is over 10,000&#13;
hectares of net irrigated area and a medium scheme is 2,000-10,000 hectares of net irrigated area).&#13;
One of the consequences of developing this potential is the displacement of people, primarily&#13;
through the storage of water, construction of headworks, and other infrastructure. In addition to&#13;
those persons displaced, the process of land acquisition for these irrigation schemes can result in&#13;
significant numbers of additional persons having their incomes adversely affected through the loss&#13;
of their cultivable land and economic opportunities as a result of development of irrigation&#13;
networks like canals and drains.&#13;
5.    Since 1947, Orissa has undertaken construction of about 70 major and medium irrigation&#13;
projects. Using data available for 44 of these projects, the total number of persons displaced by&#13;
irrigation projects (data not available for persons affected but not displaced), has been about&#13;
380,000. About 40 percent of these persons displaced have been tribal; another 15 percent have&#13;
been scheduled castes. Orissa has a large tribal population; 22 percent of its total population are&#13;
tribal, many of whom are still forest-dependent to varying degrees. Thus, scheduled castes and&#13;
tribes, who are among the poorest segments of the population, constitute more than half of those&#13;
displaced by water sector development projects in the State.&#13;
6.     Although Orissa did not have an R&amp;R policy for the irrigation sector, the State's Irrigation&#13;
Department, responding to problems posed by resettlement in the irrigation sector, began in 1977&#13;
to issue a series of Government Resolutions which provided the basis for identifying PAPs,&#13;
defining their entitlements, and setting out guidelines for planning of resettlement. In terms of&#13;
institutional responsibility, land acquisition officers in the Revenue Department handled payments&#13;
to PAPs and were responsible for working with the Irrigation Department Engineers to ensure that&#13;
displaced persons were resettled according to the prevailing Government Resolutions. For major&#13;
irrigation schemes, land acquisition officers were also responsible for R&amp;R. Still, the main issues&#13;
faced by R&amp;R were: lack of R&amp;R planning; lack of census data or socio-economic surveys; poor&#13;
quality land under the "land-for-land" rehabilitation option; inadequate compensation for lost&#13;
assets; inadequate measures to ensure PAPs' restoration of incomes; significant time gaps between&#13;
payment of compensation and actual displacement; inadequate consultation with, and participation&#13;
of, PAPs in R&amp;R; and lack of grievance procedures.&#13;
7.    The lack of an institutional apparatus to plan, fund, implement and monitor R&amp;R, together&#13;
with gaps in the policy provisions were the two central weaknesses causing these problems.&#13;

C. PREPARATION OF ORISSA'S NEW R&amp;R POLICY AND R&amp;R ACTION PLAN&#13;
8.     During 1992-93, an intensive series of missions to review R&amp;R performance in the field&#13;
and the supporting legislative and administrative environment were conducted by Bank-funded&#13;
consultants in association with the Government of Orissa (GOO) and supported by visits of Bank&#13;
R&amp;R specialists.&#13;
9.     In early 1994 the Orissa Government constituted an Inter-Departmental Working Group'&#13;
to review its existing compendium of Government Resolutions governing resettlement. The&#13;
primary task of the Working Group was to prepare a revised R&amp;R policy for the irrigation sector in&#13;
the State consistent with the requirements of the Bank's Operational Directives on Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement (Operational Directive 4.30) and Indigenous Peoples (Operational Directive 4.20).&#13;
The draft policy was circulated for discussion in March 1994, and was approved by GOO on&#13;
August 27, 1994 (Government Order No. 25296) and took effect on September 1, 1994. Issuance&#13;
of the policy establishes Orissa as one of the few states in India to have issued an R&amp;R policy&#13;
aiming at comprehensive coverage of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement needs and the&#13;
needs of indigenous peoples.&#13;
10.     Another recognized key need was to establish a state institutional structure to implement&#13;
R&amp;R in the water sector. In August 1994, GOO established an R&amp;R Directorate in the DOWR to&#13;
be responsible for carrying out GOO's R&amp;R policy for PAPs in the water resources sector (refer&#13;
para. 16).&#13;
11.     These initiatives have been paralleled by intensive field work at each of the WRCP's&#13;
seven field sites where R&amp;R is involved. This has involved Socio-Economic Surveys at each site&#13;
and preparation of site specific Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPs) and&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs). Other preparatory actions included training of&#13;
R&amp;R Directorate Staff and DOWR engineers, and selection and training of NGOs for field&#13;
implementation of RAPs.&#13;
D. THE 1994 ORISSA R&amp;R POLICY&#13;
12.      The new R&amp;R policy represents significant improvement from GOO's previous policy&#13;
("Land for Land" to be allotted by government, to the extent possible within the comnmand area of&#13;
the irrigation). It now provides greater recognition to women, tribals, and other persons&#13;
economically affected, including landless, sharecroppers, tenant farmers, laborers and&#13;
encroachers. Some of these improvements are: expansion of the definition of displaced families to&#13;
include unmarried daughters thirty years or older, widows, sharecroppers and encroachers,&#13;
enhancement and adjustment for inflation of cash grant to be provided in lieu of homestead land,&#13;
and house construction and maintenance assistance, enhancement of rehabilitation assistance,&#13;
reimbursement for registration fee and stamp duty, and rehabilitation assistance grant in lieu of land&#13;
for purchase of productive assets. In recognition of the need to empower women, GOO's new&#13;
R&amp;R policy also mandates issuance of ownership titles for homestead and agricultural land jointly&#13;
in the names of the project affected person and his/her spouse, and that cash payments in lieu of&#13;
homestead land, house construction and maintenance allowances, and rehabilitation assistance are&#13;
to be paid jointly in favor of the entitled PAP and his/her spouse. In contrast to the old policy,&#13;
GOO's new R&amp;R policy contains a number of provisions for tribals with the objective of allowing&#13;
I     This Working Group was chaired by the Additional Secretary, DOWR, with members representing the&#13;
Departments of Revenue, Forests, Rural Development, Harijan and Tribal Welfare Departments, and the Engineer-In-Chief&#13;
of Planning for the DOWR. The Working Group also included an NGO representative with experience in tribal matters, a&#13;
lawyer with R&amp;R experience, two district collectors with R&amp;R experience, a sociologist/anthropologist with tribal&#13;
experience, and a consultant involved in the preparation of the RAPs for some of the WRCP subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

tribals to retain their previous way of life. This includes providing resettlement sites as close to&#13;
their area of displacement as possible and in surroundings which are similar to the area from which&#13;
they were displaced. The policy also provides that priority be given to tribals for allocation of&#13;
agricultural land, development of wastelands, and employment in the project. Additionally, the&#13;
new policy has much stronger provisions relating to economic rehabilitation in general, and the&#13;
specific role of NGOs in this aspect of R&amp;R, including strategies for alternative income-generating&#13;
activities. Provisions are also made for grievances related to the payment of compensation for land&#13;
acquired under the project. The R&amp;R Action Plan Matrix at Attachment 1, summarizing salient&#13;
features of the Action Plan, makes reference to key features of the R&amp;R Policy in relation to the&#13;
guidelines provided by the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30.&#13;
E.      DESCRIPTION OF LAND ACOUISITION UNDER THE WRCP&#13;
13.     Socio-economic surveys prepared by consultants have reviewed all of the seven project&#13;
schemes comprising Badanala, Harabanghi, Hariharjore, Rengali, Upper Jonk, Baghua, and&#13;
Mahanadi-Chitrotpala to determine the extent of land acquisition involved, the needs and&#13;
aspirations of the PAPs and communities involved, and the nature of compensation, resettlement&#13;
and economic rehabilitation required. On the basis of these surveys, detailed RAPs were prepared&#13;
in conjunction with GOO and in consultation with, and participation of PAPs. No land acquisition&#13;
is required for the Naraj Barrage and is therefore not covered in the R&amp;R component. The surveys&#13;
covered land acquisition for both the reservoirs to be constructed and/or completed and new canals&#13;
and other distribution infrastructure, as well as persons affected by works involved in construction&#13;
and/or completion of structures. In total, about 1799 ha of private lands would need to be acquired&#13;
for the WRCP, plus about 1680 ha of government lands, primarily unused wastelands, and about&#13;
1636 ha of forest lands, distributed over 7 project schemes as presented below (Attachment 4).&#13;
Statewide, about 2,596 persons would be displaced (PDPs) by the WRCP investments and about&#13;
31,207 persons (PAPs) will be affected in varying degrees though not expected to be displaced&#13;
(Attachment 5). Over 75 percent of the PAP/PDPs would be in the command areas for the new&#13;
irrigation, generally with only small parts of their holdings affected by canals or drains. Such&#13;
persons would be direct beneficiaries of irrigation, with substantially improved yields and&#13;
incomes.&#13;
14.     Socio-economic surveys and detailed resettlement and economic rehabilitation action&#13;
plans have been followed up by subproject-specific Indigenous Peoples Development Plans for&#13;
Tribal Communities (IPDPs) carried out by consultants. The primary objective of the IPDPs is to&#13;
implement additional measures as required for the specific social, economic, and cultural needs of&#13;
indigenous peoples affected by the project. The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP),&#13;
also funded under the WRCP, is at Annex I l.&#13;

F.    OBJECrIVE OF R&amp;R COMPONENT&#13;
15.      The general objective of this component is to ensure that persons affected by land&#13;
acquisition under the Project are left as well off or better off than their previous situation.&#13;
Additionally, it is also the objective of this project that tribals do not suffer adverse effects during&#13;
the development process and that they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.&#13;
To meet these objectives, the following measures have been adopted:&#13;
(a) strengthening of the institutional capacity to expedite R&amp;R through the&#13;
establishment of an R&amp;R Directorate within DOWR, and appointment of a Resettlement&#13;
and Rehabilitation Officer (RRO) and a Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO) at each&#13;
major/medium irrigation scheme.&#13;
(b) assistance to PAPs, with consideration of special needs of tribals, through NGOs,&#13;
for purchase of productive assets, for self- employment, and for other income-generating&#13;
activities, including associated funding through house construction and economic&#13;
rehabilitation assistance, and maintenance allowance.&#13;
(c) assistance to PAPs with special focus on tribals' special needs, to facilitate their&#13;
access, through NGOs' assistance, to existing government programs, and poverty&#13;
alleviation and other income-generating schemes.&#13;
G.    INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING&#13;
16.      R&amp;R Directorate, To establish a permnanent institutional capability within DOWR to deal&#13;
with R&amp;R matters, in 1994 GOO created a Directorate of R&amp;R headed by a Director from the&#13;
Indian Administrative Services (IAS) with the senior rank of Additional Secretary and reporting&#13;
directly to the Secretary, DOWR. The R&amp;R Directorate is responsible for carrying out&#13;
government policies on land acquisition and resettlement and economic rehabilitation for the water&#13;
resources sector. These include the planning, coordination, implementation and monitoring of all&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement and economic rehabilitation activities under the WRCP. In&#13;
carrying out these functions, the R&amp;R Directorate is also responsible for contracting with NGOs to&#13;
carry out site-specific resettlement and economic rehabilitation for each subproject, for overseeing&#13;
NGOs' functions, and for setting up and providing approval for the joint accounts established&#13;
under the R&amp;R Action Plans. To support the R&amp;R Directorate's functions at Headquarters in&#13;
Bhubaneswar, it is supported by a Land Acquisition and R&amp;R Unit headed by an Orissa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

an Anthropologist and supported by an Agricultural Economist, and a Statistical Unit headed by an&#13;
Assistant Conservator of Forest, supported by a Research Assistant.&#13;
17.     Field Implementation Arrangements. Project level Rehabilitation Advisory Committees&#13;
(RACs) have been constituted and functioning in each of the subproject areas. For major projects&#13;
involving more than one district, the concemned Revenue Division Commissioner is the Chairman&#13;
of the committee, otherwise the District Collector chairs the RACs. Its members are drawn from&#13;
all concerned District Level Development departments, in addition to peoples' representatives of the&#13;
local area. The RACs main functions are to review all aspects of the site-specific RAPs to ensure&#13;
effective implementation, to identify bottlenecks encountered and, to propose measures to resolve&#13;
them. In addition, the RACs also undertake inspection of land earmarked for resettlement of&#13;
displaced persons, dispense advice for improvement of common facilities at resettlement colonies,&#13;
and achieve resolution of PAP grievances related to resettlement and economic rehabilitation. The&#13;
RACs will also play an oversight role against deterioration of physical and social environment.&#13;
Access to the courts for redressal of grievances is built into the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.&#13;
However, for speedier out-of-court disposal of grievances of PAPs relating to awards and payment&#13;
of compensation, the PAPs have recourse to the local Lok Adalats which are constituted for this&#13;
specific purpose. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements are described in para 35.&#13;
18.     On-Site Arrangements. At the field level, the Directorate and its District level RACs are&#13;
supported by a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officer (RRO) and/or a Special Land Acquisition&#13;
Officer (SLAO) assigned to every major irrigation scheme. The RRO would have primary&#13;
responsibility for implementation of RAPs and supervision of NGOs. For schemes with more&#13;
than 500 affected families (whether major or medium) a separate RRO would be assigned. For&#13;
schemes with less than 500 affected families, the SLAO would also be responsible for the RRO's&#13;
functions. A Consultant NGO (and/or Community Worker) would be assigned to each&#13;
RRO/SLAO at a ratio of one NGO/Community Worker for every 250 displaced/adversely affected&#13;
families, to assist with the resettlement and economic rehabilitation of the PAPs (refer paras. 30&#13;
and 31). The above Institutional Arrangements are shown in the organizational chart at Attachment&#13;
H.&#13;
H .     PROJECT AFFECTED AND DISPLACED PERSONS&#13;
19.     Definitions. Project Affected Persons (PAPs) or Project Displaced Persons (PDPs)&#13;
include all persons who stand to lose all or part of their land and/or homestead, or whose&#13;
livelihoods, trade or occupation, and other economic opportunities have been adversely affected,&#13;
directly or indirectly, due to the construction of a water resources project. This includes:&#13;
(a) land-owning persons losing all or part of their land and/or homestead;&#13;
(b) landless persons such as laborers, sharecroppers, encroachers, and tenant&#13;
farmers losing all or part of their cultivated and/or homestead land;&#13;
(c) major children including unmarried daughters more than 30 years of age;&#13;
(d) widows and divorcees with no source of livelihood; and&#13;
(e) minor orphans and physically and mentally retarded persons regardless of sex and&#13;
age.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
20.     A Project Displaced Person (PDP) is a PAP who loses his/her land including homestead&#13;
land, or who loses his homestead. A Project Affected Person (PAP) is a person who loses part of&#13;
his/her land, but does not lose the homestead land.&#13;
I. ENTITLEMENTS&#13;
21.     Compensation for Land Acquisition. Under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (LAA), as&#13;
amended in 1984, the State commits to pay the market price for the land to be acquired, and,&#13;
recognizing the involuntary nature of acquisition, provides for a 30 percent solatium, including&#13;
interest at the prevailing rate in case of delays in payment of compensation for land acquisition.&#13;
Under the LAA, district level Negotiating Committees are authorized to conduct negotiations with&#13;
landowners to establish full and fair valuation of land and speedier settlement. If the negotiating&#13;
process does not result in a "consent award", then land acquisition proceedings continue using the&#13;
normal procedures established under the Act.&#13;
22.     Entitlements under the R&amp;R Action Plan. Additional to the above compensation, the&#13;
R&amp;R Action Plan provides the following entitlements, applicable to PAPs/PDPs:&#13;
(a) Land-for-Land/Rehabilitation Assistance Grant. Provision of productively&#13;
comparable replacement land on the basis of one acre of unirrigated land lost to one&#13;
acre of unirrigated replacement land, or one half acre of irrigated replacement land,&#13;
up to a maximum of two acres of replacement irrigated land or four acres if&#13;
unirrigated. Alternatively, at PAPs/PDPs request, provision of Rehabilitation&#13;
Assistance Grant (RAG) of Rs.20,000 per acre of irrigated land or Rs. 10,000 per&#13;
acre of unirrigated land, up to a maximum of two acres of replacement irrigated land&#13;
or four acres if unirrigated.&#13;
If the land-for-land option is chosen, the land would be identified by the PAP&#13;
within a well defined geographic area near the village or in the command area within&#13;
a specific time frame. Ownership would be recorded jointly in the name of the PAP&#13;
and his or her spouse. Where the land offered is not acceptable to the PAPs on&#13;
valid grounds, the State will assist PAPs to purchase appropriate land from private&#13;
sources with assistance from a Purchase Comnuittee chaired by the subproject&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officer (RRO) with members representing the local&#13;
community and the PAPs concerned.&#13;
In cases where the Rehabilitation Assistance Grant is chosen by the PAP/PDP,&#13;
the RAG will be awarded jointly in favor of the PAP and his or her spouse. The&#13;
amount would be deposited in a joint bank account with withdrawal against&#13;
signatures of the PAP and his or her spouse, the NGO and the RRO. Withdrawals&#13;
would be for purchase of productive assets, excluding land, such as farm&#13;
animals, agricultural implements, or for self-employment (e.g. equipment for&#13;
establishing a small business) or other income-generating activities. The RAG will&#13;
be adjusted for inflation.&#13;
(b) Reimbursement of Registration Fee and Stamp Duty. The State will provide&#13;
reimbursement of registration fee and stamp duty, if replacement land is purchased&#13;
within three years of receipt of the rehabilitation assistance.&#13;
(c) Homestead Land. Provision of 0.2 acres of homestead land (or at PDP request,&#13;
Rs. 20,000 cash grant in lieu of homestead land).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
(d) Home Construction Allowance (HCA). Rs. 20,000 for construction of new&#13;
house.&#13;
(e)  Maintenance Allowance. Rs.500 per month from the date of displacement&#13;
through a period of one year. In all WRCP subprojects in the scheme&#13;
completion category, for PDPs being given land in the command&#13;
area, the Maintenance Allowance would be extended to two additional&#13;
years to provide support during the period when irrigation is not available.&#13;
The purpose of the Maintenance Allowance would be to compensate for&#13;
the PDPs' lost incomes during the transition period, so as to meet basic&#13;
necessities to ensure that PDPs are not obliged to sell existing family&#13;
assets pending restoration of earning ability.&#13;
In addition to the above entitlements the R&amp;R Action Plan will also target existing Government&#13;
Programs and Poverty Alleviation Schemes (refer paras. 28 and 29) to all sites where R&amp;R is&#13;
taking place. At each site an NGO will have responsibility for facilitating access by all PAPs/PDPs&#13;
to the various entitlements and benefits above.&#13;
23.     Entitlements for Land-Owning PAPs/PDPs. Land-owning project-displaced persons&#13;
(PDPs) whose land or homestead have been acquired for the purpose of the Project are entitled, in&#13;
addition to the compensation for the land acquired, to the following entitlements: (a) land-for-&#13;
land/rehabilitation assistance grant; (b) registration fee and stamp duty exemption; (c) homestead&#13;
land; (d) home contruction allowance; (e) maintenance allowance; and (f) access to government&#13;
programs and poverty alleviation schemes. A land-owning PAP whose home is not acquired but&#13;
who loses part of his agricultural lands is entitled, in addition to compensation for the land&#13;
acquired, to: (a) land-for-land/rehabilitation assistance grant; (b) registration fee and stamp duty&#13;
exemption; and (c) access to government programs and poverty alleviation schemes.&#13;
24.     Entitlements for Landless PAPs/PDPs. The landless category includes tenant farmers,&#13;
sharecroppers, encroachers and landless laborers. A landless person who is displaced (PDP) is&#13;
entitled to: (a) 4 acres of unirrigated land or 2 acres of irrigated land or the rehabilitation assistance&#13;
grant equivalent to this area; (b) registration fee and stamp duty exemption, if he elects to purchase&#13;
land; (c) homestead land; (d) home contruction allowance; (e) maintenance allowance; and (f)&#13;
access to government programs and poverty alleviation schemes. If a tenant farmer, sharecropper&#13;
or encroacher loses his cultivated land in such a way that he becomes landless or he loses a portion&#13;
of his only holding and thereby would be compelled to lead an uneconomic living, he would be&#13;
entitled to: (a) provision of land equal to the cultivated area actually lost if unirrigated or half the&#13;
area if irrigated, subject to a maximum of 4 acres of unirrigated land or 2 acres of irrigated land (or,&#13;
alternatively, at PAP's request, provision of rehabilitation assistance grant); and (b) access to&#13;
govemment programs and poverty alleviation schemes.&#13;
25.     Entitlements for Encroachers Losing Only Homestead or Becoming Landless Through&#13;
Loss of Encroached Land. Encroachers would receive the same entitlements as indicated in para.&#13;
24 above. About five percent of the lands to be taken up under the project is estimated to represent&#13;
encroached land on land in the "objectionable" category (i.e. government-owned land defined by&#13;
GOO as lands set apart for the common use of villages, for notified development schemes, for&#13;
govemment corporations, etc.). For encroachers on such "objectionable" lands, GOO has&#13;
provided additional clarification regarding their entitlements under the R&amp;R Policy. If the&#13;
encroacher loses his encroached homestead land, he will be treated as a displaced persons&#13;
irrespective of the legal status of his occupation of the land. Therefore, he is entitled to the full&#13;
R&amp;R entitlements under the R&amp;R Action Plan as described for landless PDPs in para 24 above.&#13;
Similarly, if he loses all or part of his encroached agricultural lands, but not his homestead, he&#13;
would be treated as a landless PAP who is not displaced and be eligible for the benefits described&#13;
&#13;

for landless PAPs in para 24 above. The specific entitlements for encroachers on objectionable&#13;
lands are listed in Appendix 1 of Attachment 1 of this Annex.&#13;
J. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE&#13;
26.     About 22 percent of Orissa's population are tribals. Historically, they have been forest-&#13;
dependent, but with forests disappearing in Orissa over the last decades, the majority of tribal&#13;
(indigenous) people sustain their livelihood by a combination of podu (shifting) cultivation,&#13;
collection of forest produce, and settled agriculture and wage labor, with the two latter occupational&#13;
categories gaining importance. Tribal PAPs and PDPs will be entitled to the full R&amp;R benefits of&#13;
the R&amp;R Action Plan, described in this Annex. As indicated in the various sections of this Annex,&#13;
special features have additionally been built into the R&amp;R Action Plan to cater to the particular&#13;
socio-cultural and economic needs of tribal peoples. These have as a basis the special socio-&#13;
economic survey and interview techniques employed in the socio-economic surveys to ascertain the&#13;
particular needs of tribals and other potentially vulnerable groups, based on participatory interview&#13;
techniques involving the individual families and family members, tribal communities as a whole,&#13;
and sub-groups within such communities (eg., tribal women). Measures adopted are specific to&#13;
the needs at each site. They include particular attention to relocation sites, where, for instance,&#13;
access to forest lands is an important need, and design of site-specific RAPs catering to the&#13;
individual and community needs of tribal families. Infrastructure facilities at relocation sites have&#13;
also been determined based on the identified tribal needs. A key feature is the selection of&#13;
appropriate economic rehabilitation activities, tailored to the individual needs of each tribal family,&#13;
and also the selection of government development schemes, in particular the ones with a&#13;
poverty/tribal development focus (para 28). The R&amp;R Plan's Organizational features also build in&#13;
the staff and institutional capabilities to handle the needs of indigenous peoples, including linkages&#13;
with GOOs Tribal Welfare Department, an anthropologist heading the R&amp;R Directorate's socio-&#13;
economic unit, and use of NGOs chosen for their practical capabilities to handle the needs of&#13;
vulnerable groups including tribals. Additional special organizational features for indigenous&#13;
peoples are described at Table 2 of Annex 11. Support from consultants experienced with&#13;
indigenous peoples will also be provided during implementation.&#13;
27.     Additional to the above, an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) has been&#13;
prepared in accordance with the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 based on comprehensive socio-&#13;
economic studies specifically designed for IPDP purposes carried out in all sub-project areas with a&#13;
tribal population (the IPDP is at Annex 11). These supplementary surveys covered the WRCP sub-&#13;
projects of Harabanghi, Badanala, Upper Jonk, Hariharjore, Rengali and Baghua; the total tribal&#13;
population in these commands is 56,808 persons. The tribal population in Mahanadi-Chitrotpala is&#13;
only 55, equal to 0.1 percent of the total population in the sub-project area and therefore not&#13;
included in the IPDP. The purpose of the studies was to anticipate and assess the impact of the&#13;
project on tribals and their felt needs, and to propose mitigation and community development&#13;
activities to be carried out according to specific plans in each subproject. Accordingly, support&#13;
activities to improve tribals's environment and standard of living, based on their own participation&#13;
were developed. The IPDP supplements other project activities under the OWRCP and GOO's&#13;
ongoing development programs for tribals, and will be funded under the project. Tribal&#13;
communities and tribal neighborhoods within a larger mixed community/caste villages will be the&#13;
target group for implementation of the IPDP. The strategy will have a poverty focus benefitting all&#13;
the weaker communities. Infrastructural improvements, such as schools and public health&#13;
facilities, will be designed and planned accordingly. Activities will also address the particular&#13;
vulnerable situation of tribals, e.g. land rights, literacy, health care, capacity-building and&#13;
empowerment. Details of these activities are provided in the Indigenous Peoples Development&#13;
Plan at Annex 11. Mitigating measures identified by the IPDP will be additional to the entitlements&#13;
provided to all WRCP PDPs/PAPs, including tribals, as spelled out in paras. 21-25. Thus, tribal&#13;
PDPs/PAPs will be entitled, as appropriate, to all the benefits available to PAPs/PDPs: for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;

instance, to land compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, and, under the R&amp;R Action Plan,&#13;
rehabilitation assistance (including "land for land" option), maintenance allowance, homestead land&#13;
and home construction allowance, access to government programs and access to NGO assistance&#13;
for economic rehabilitation. Additionally, as indicated above and in Annex 1 1, special additional&#13;
features for indigenous peoples also apply.&#13;
K. ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION SCHEMES.&#13;
28.     Under the WRCP, existing government development or poverty alleviation programs&#13;
will specifically target PAPs in all WRCP R&amp;R sites. There are many such programs, some&#13;
common to all locations, and others specific to particular areas. A primary activity of the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate, the district collectors, the rehabilitation advisory committees, and the government&#13;
block development officers in the localities cncerned will be to harness available prograrns and&#13;
target them in particular on project affected/displaced persons. The NGO at each site will be the&#13;
primary catalyser for the targeting exercise, providing a two-way flow of information and influence&#13;
specific to the particular needs and aptitudes of each PAP/PDP. Specific programs are identified in&#13;
each RAP. Examples of government development programs include the horticulture, dairy,&#13;
smallholder forestry, sericulture, and other agriculture-based schemes; self-employment schemes&#13;
under the Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP); the Drought Prone Area Program&#13;
(DPAP); the Modified Area Development Program; and several artisanal and skill&#13;
development/training programs. Many of these have adaptive features to cater to the needs of&#13;
tribals, minorities, and women. Additionally, focus and specific targeting would be made on those&#13;
programs catering specifically to the needs of women and tribals. These include for instance, the&#13;
Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) scheme, the Integrated Tribal&#13;
Development Program, Scheduled Caste Development Program, and the Forest Farming for Rural&#13;
Poor Scheme.&#13;
29.     Supplemental to the above, an additional scheme would be specifically assisted under&#13;
the WRCP, exploiting the interesting opportunity of linking fresh-water fisheries on created&#13;
reservoirs with R&amp;R. Together with similar initiatives in the Tamil Nadu WRCP, this would be&#13;
the first such formal linkage for India. Under the ongoing Shrimp and Fish Culture Project (Credit&#13;
2329-IN), the Fisheries Department would target WRCP PAPs for its fisheries income-generating&#13;
schemes in the following districts and reservoirs that the project is currently operating in, namely:&#13;
Harabanghi Reservoir in the District of Gajapati; and Badanala Reservoir in the District of&#13;
Rayagada. Such activities will also be funded in the following reservoirs to be included in the&#13;
project's expanded scope (restructuring currently under consideration): Baghua Reservoir in the&#13;
Kalahandi District, Upper Jonk Reservoir in Nawapara District, Rengali Reservoir in the&#13;
Dhenkanal District, and Hariharjore Reservoir in the Sonepur District. Incomes anticipated from&#13;
fisheries are substantial with the added desirable feature that benefits will primarily be to the&#13;
reservoir-affected persons, representing the bulk of the project displaced persons. Details are&#13;
provided in Attachment 7.&#13;
L. ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOs)&#13;
30.     NGOs will play a crucial role in implementation of the site-specific RAPS and IPDPs.&#13;
Suitable NGOs with hands-on experience in rural development community organization and tribal&#13;
affairs would be contracted by the R&amp;R Directorate to undertake primary responsibility for&#13;
implementing the RAPs and IPDPs. On two of the sites, NGOs have already been contracted and&#13;
have commenced work, and the NGO identification/contracting process is advanced on the other&#13;
sites. The NGOs would represent the interest of PAPs, the special interests of tribals (rights and&#13;
entitlements), organize community participation, handle women's needs and facilitate PAPs' access&#13;
to ongoing government programs and poverty alleviation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page I I of 15&#13;
31.     The NGOs, in conjunction with concerned rural development and line departments,&#13;
would work with the PAPs and the RROs to assist the PAPs in obtaining benefits from mainstream&#13;
government programs and ongoing poverty alleviation schemes. They would be working with&#13;
individual families, and, under the supervision of the Scheme RRO/SLAO, would be mainly&#13;
responsible for ensuring that project affected families:&#13;
(a) are adequately informed of their entitlements under the 1994&#13;
Policy and receive their full entitlements;&#13;
(b) participate in the planning process and are adequately informed&#13;
of resettlement schedules and plans;&#13;
(c) are physically resettled in a manner which respects their&#13;
rights and dignity as individuals;&#13;
(d) are informed of alternative economic rehabilitation opportunities;&#13;
(e) have access to agencies and resources which can help them restore&#13;
their previous standard of living;&#13;
(f) are generally assisted in their resettlement and rehabilitation&#13;
and provided with continuous follow-up assistance.&#13;
Criteria for NGO selection are at Annex 16 of the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
M. TRAINING&#13;
32.     Training has been provided to a number of DOWR engineering staff both at headquarters&#13;
and in the field and to selected NGOs to increase their knowledge and skills to deal with the social&#13;
and economic dimensions of land acquisition, resettlement and economic rehabilitation. Training&#13;
courses included concepts of economic rehabilitation, women's development, linkage with other&#13;
government schemes, community organization and participation, and the role of NGOs. It also&#13;
covered preparation of model rehabilitation action plans and setting up indicators for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation. The methodology for training was by seminar presentation and experience-based&#13;
learning through group work and discussions. It was supplemented by hands-on training in the&#13;
field in participatory rural appraisal, participation in meetings with project-affected villages and&#13;
communities, interviews with project affected peoples, tribals, women and other vulnerable&#13;
groups, and mock coordination meetings between NGOs, block development officers, RROs and&#13;
LAOs. The objective is to help sensitize course participants, DOWR engineering staff and NGOs&#13;
alike, to hardships facing project affected persons. During project implementation additional&#13;
training and refresher courses along similar lines will be provided periodically and funded under&#13;
the project. The main aim of the training program is to expose DOWR's engineering staff to the&#13;
R&amp;R aspects of irrigation projects to provide them with the basic tools that will enable them to&#13;
work effectively under the R&amp;R Directorate's guidance, with the NGOs and the PAPs in effective&#13;
implementation of the WRCP's R&amp;R component. Training will also be provided to the NGOs.&#13;
This would focus primarily on entitlements under the policy and R&amp;R procedures, as the initial&#13;
experience with the NGOs already contracted indicates good existing expertise with social&#13;
organization and development activities. Opportunity for visits and seminars, in India or overseas,&#13;
would also be provided for senior R&amp;R Directorate and other selected DOWR staff, and, as&#13;
appropriate, to selected NGO personnel.&#13;

N. RETROFIT SURVEY FOR INCOME RESTORATION&#13;
33.     Rengali Hydropower Project. The earlier constructed Rengali hydropower dam had a&#13;
large resettlement scheme which was completed during the last ten years. There is a need for more&#13;
follow-up work with the project affected peoples in existing relocation villages to ensure that they&#13;
are economically rehabilitated. Retrofit measures could take the form of income generating&#13;
activities for PAPs, or more specific measures such as electrification. The R&amp;R Directorate is&#13;
undertaking a Retrofit Survey of the existing relocation villages from earlier investment at Rengali&#13;
to determine the need for follow-up assistance and to identify specific retrofit measures.&#13;
34.     Subernarekha Irrigation Project. With the aid of technical assistance provided by&#13;
consultants, GOO has made significant progress with R&amp;R on Subernarekha. However,&#13;
additional measures are likely to be needed to restore the livelihoods of project affected peoples in&#13;
existing relocation villages to a sustainable level. The focus of these measures would be mainly on&#13;
community infrastructure for the relocation villages and economic rehabilitation measures directed&#13;
at project affected peoples. A supplementary survey will be undertaken under the project for the&#13;
purpose of identifying additional intervention, and a retrofit action plan as needed.&#13;
0. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
35.     To safeguard against shortfalls due to possible implementation weaknesses, and to&#13;
ensure the welfare of PAPs and PDPs, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the R&amp;R progress&#13;
and impact will be undertaken on a regular basis (refer Implementation Schedule at Attachment 2).&#13;
As part of its R&amp;R management function, the R&amp;R Directorate will undertake routine M&amp;E of the&#13;
program's progress and impact, with assistance, as needed of consultants. Additionally, more in-&#13;
depth M&amp;E will be undertaken by independent consultants. Attachment 7 provides Monitorable&#13;
Indicators of Progress and Impact of R&amp;R. Monitoring and evaluation will cover the physical,&#13;
economic and social, and financial and administrative aspects of R&amp;R. The Independent&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Consultants will review all aspects of R&amp;R, but in particular, will focus&#13;
on independent assessment of the standard of living and sustainability of PAPs/PDPs. Reports&#13;
will be prepared annually by the independent consultants until it is assessed that the economic&#13;
rehabilitation process is complete. As needed, special supplementary surveys would also be&#13;
conducted. All M&amp;E reports would be furnished to the State Project Monitoring Committee and&#13;
IDA.&#13;
P. PROJECT SUPPORT&#13;
36.     Government would finance land acquisition, homestead land, as well as the maintenance&#13;
allowance. IDA funding would be for related civil works, equipment, vehicles, in-country and&#13;
overseas training and consultancies, incremental staff and operating costs of the R&amp;R Directorate,&#13;
and contracts with NGOs for implementation of the RAPs and IPDPs, including, within the NGO&#13;
contracts, provision of rehabilitation assistance to PAPs for purchase of productive assets,&#13;
excluding land, such as farm animals, agricultural tools and implements, or for self-employment&#13;
(e.g. equipment for establishing a small business) or other income generating activities.&#13;
Consultancy provisions include allowance for additional socio-economic surveys, indigenous&#13;
peoples development plans, resettlement and economic rehabilitation action plans for future&#13;
subprojects, project supervision, and monitoring and evaluation. R&amp;R monitoring and special&#13;
auditing procedures would apply to ensure that the rehabilitation assistance is used for creation of&#13;
productive assets. Consultancy assistance would include an annual review by an independent&#13;
consultant of the status of PAPs at all sites.&#13;

Q. R&amp;R COMPONENT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
37.     Total cost of the R&amp;R Component, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at Rs.781 million base cost. The summary breakdown of project costs (refer Annex 18,&#13;
Tables 26 to 32 for full details) are as follows:&#13;

Total                                   781&#13;
R. BENEFITS UNDER THE R&amp;R ACTION PLAN&#13;
38.     Over 75 percent of PAPs/PDPs would be direct beneficiaries of new irrigation provided&#13;
under the project. As with other beneficiaries of new irrigation, their incomes would thus be&#13;
expected to increase some four-fold under the project (para 39). Provisions under the R&amp;R Action&#13;
Plan cater both to such direct beneficiaries and to those for which new irrigation is not possible.&#13;
For those who are not direct beneficiaries of new irrigation (as well as for those who are), the&#13;
R&amp;R Action Plan provides benefits enabling Project Affected (PAPs) and Project Displaced&#13;
Persons (PDPs) to be substantial beneficiaries from the project, even without new irrigation. This&#13;
would stem from the package of benefits provided under the R&amp;R Action Plan (land-for-&#13;
land/economic rehabilitation grant, maintenance grant till earnings restored, homestead land, home&#13;
construction allowance, stamp duty and registration tax exemptions, targeted government&#13;
development programs, community infrastructure at all sites, NGO assistance, etc. (refer paras. 21&#13;
to 25). This gain in living standards would be particularly marked if the PAPs/PDPs are currently&#13;
in the landless category (including encroachers [refer para. 44]), or if they are tribal persons for&#13;
which additional benefits are provided under the IPDPs (refer Annex 11).&#13;
39.     Benefits from Irrigation. Seventy five percent of private land acquisition relates to land&#13;
needs for canal and drainage construction within the new command areas. While compensation is&#13;
paid for all such land acquisition, and PAPs/PDPs get the full R&amp;R benefits for which they are&#13;
entitled, disruptions are usually small in such cases, involving only part of the holdings and with&#13;
subsequent increased yields from irrigation. To the extent possible, land provisions under the&#13;
R&amp;R program will be located in the new irrigated areas. Thus, actual direct beneficiaries from&#13;
irrigation may exceed 75 percent. This situation would be the typical one for most canal-affected&#13;
persons, and to the extent possible, reservoir affected PAPs/PDPs would also be provided with&#13;
irrigated lands, making the possible actual percentage of transformation to irrigated conditions&#13;
higher than the above estimate. The direct project benefits to farmers indicated in the table at para&#13;
5.13 of the SAR would apply to all such PAPs/PDPs, with an expected increase in net incomes&#13;
from farming of over four-fold.&#13;
40.     Benefits for Landless PAPs/PDPs including Encroachers. For landless persons&#13;
including encroachers, the gain in living standards would be more substantial than for landed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 14 of 15&#13;
persons. A landless displaced laborer or encroacher would be entitled to four acres of unirrigated&#13;
land or two acres of irrigated land, thus establishing the PAP/PDP as a landowner. The PAP/PDP&#13;
would now have his/her own landholding, and with an area above the average private landholding&#13;
area in Orissa.2 Hence, landless persons and encroachers, generally in the poorest segments&#13;
before being project affected/displaced, would subsequently have above average assets as sources&#13;
of livelihood (refer to paras. 24 and 25 and Appendix 1 of Attachment 1).&#13;
41.     Benefits for Tribals. Tribal (indigenous) people have the full entitlements available to&#13;
other non-tribal PDPs/PAPs. Thus, the various benefits described in Section R and other sections&#13;
of this annex apply in full to indigenous people. Beyond this, the special socio-cultural and&#13;
economic needs of tribals and their generally vulnerable situation in the development process, need&#13;
to be catered to. To this end, socio-economic surveys and resultant RAPs have been specifically&#13;
designed to cater to the special needs of indigenous people. The resultant provisions for tribals&#13;
under the R&amp;R action plan, as described in this Annex, and in particular at paras. 26 and 27 above,&#13;
have been especially adapted to the needs of tribals. Supplementing the RAPs, additional surveys&#13;
have been conducted on the special community needs of tribals, and an Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan (IPDP) is provided at Annex 11. This further enhances the measures under the&#13;
R&amp;R action plan, with the additional measures as described at Annex 11, also funded under the&#13;
OWRCP.&#13;
42.     Benefits for Women. Female-headed households would be entitled to the same benefits&#13;
as male-headed households as the policy provides for their full status as PAPs/PDPs. The R&amp;R&#13;
Action Plan is also designed to be particularly adaptive to the needs of women in the design of&#13;
vocational training programs and access to government income-generating schemes (a number of&#13;
government schemes which are targeted for emphasis in the R&amp;R sites are, for instance,&#13;
specifically geared towards women's needs [paras. 28 and 43]). On-site NGO assistance would&#13;
be the primary vehicle through which such focus would be provided. The R&amp;R Plan, based on&#13;
detailed social surveys including the needs of women and children, also provides for facilities&#13;
particularly important to women and families. Amongst identified needs, convenient access to safe&#13;
drinking water through wells (an important time-saving as well as health measure), and access to&#13;
schools and health services were common identified needs that have been provided for. Success&#13;
with the objective of catering to the needs of all categories of PAPs/PDPs, including such&#13;
vulnerable groups as landless, encroachers, indigenous peoples and women, would be monitored&#13;
through the R&amp;R Directorate, independent consultants, and special surveys.&#13;
43.     Benefits from Targeted Government Programs. An important thrust area for all R&amp;R&#13;
sites is the specific targeting of existing Government development or poverty alleviation programs&#13;
on PAPslPDPs (refer paras. 28 and 29). There are many such programs, some common to all&#13;
locations, and others specific to particular areas. A primary activity of the R&amp;R Directorate, the&#13;
district collectors, the rehabilitation advisory committees, and the government block development&#13;
officers in the localities concerned will be to harness the available programs and target them in&#13;
particular on project affected/displaced persons. The NGO at each site will be the primary catalyser&#13;
for the targeting exercise, providing a two-way flow of information and influence specific to the&#13;
particular needs and aptitudes of each PAP/PDP. Specific programs are identified in each RAP.&#13;
44.     Examples of government programs include the horticulture, dairy, smallholder forestry,&#13;
sericulture, and other agriculture-based schemes; self-employment schemes under the Integrated&#13;
Rural Development Program (IRDP); the Drought Prone Area Program (DPAP); the Modified Area&#13;
Development Program; and several artisanal and skill development/training programs. Many of&#13;
these have adaptive features to cater to the needs of tribals, minorities, and women. Additionally,&#13;
2     The average unirrigated landholding for the R&amp;R sites is 3.9 acres, but this figure masks a lower modal&#13;
(t; .iral) landholding, due to the presence of some larger holdings and their impact on the average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 15 of 15&#13;
focus and specific targeting would be made on those programs catering specifically to the needs of&#13;
women and tribals. These include for instance, the Development of Women and Children in Rural&#13;
Areas (DWCRA) scheme, the Integrated Tribal Development Program, Scheduled Caste&#13;
Development Program, and the Forest Farming for Rural Poor Scheme. Finally, reference may be&#13;
made to the Fisheries R&amp;R Income Generating Scheme: an innovatory program to be introduced&#13;
for funding of specific facilities under OWRCP (which, with TNWRCP, would be the first such&#13;
R&amp;R-related fisheries program in India) described at para 30, and Attachment 6 to this Annex.&#13;
Reservoirs under the OWRCP's scheme completions will have an attached fisheries development&#13;
program specifically targeted to project affected persons. Incomes anticipated from fisheries are&#13;
substantial, as indicated in the attachment, with the added desirable feature that benefits will&#13;
primarily be to the reservoir-affected persons.&#13;
45.     Summary of Benefits. Properly implemented, the OWRCP's R&amp;R Action Plan&#13;
summarized in this Annex and represented in fuller and site-specific detail in the individual scheme-&#13;
level RAPs (Project File), would enable PAPs and PDPs to have their incomes maintained or&#13;
enhanced under the project. A large percentage, estimated at over 75 percent would also be direct&#13;
beneficiaries of the irrigation provided under the project, achieving even higher incremental&#13;
earnings. The R&amp;R Action Plan also contains special provisions catering to the needs of landless,&#13;
encroachers, women and tribals (provisions for tribals are developed further in Annex 11). The&#13;
creation, during project preparation, of a govemment institutional structure for implementing the&#13;
R&amp;R program, coupled with use of NGOs at each site, has established the capacity for&#13;
implementing the program, and a permanent institutional capability thereafter.&#13;
46.     Risks. A potential risk might be lack of govemment commitment during implementation.&#13;
The major initiatives taken by GOO during the long preparation phase for the R&amp;R Action Plan&#13;
demonstrate, however, that commitment is strong. Achieved major actions include issuance of the&#13;
Orissa State R&amp;R Policy with substantially improved entitlements, and creation of the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate, both the result of careful considerations and workshops by GOO. That the Directorate&#13;
is headed by a senior officer (Additional Secretary rank) is also a measure of the importance that&#13;
Orissa now places on R&amp;R. The program is ready for implementation at all sites and has&#13;
commenced on most. Over the past three years of OWRCP preparation, clear consensus has&#13;
developed within GOO that good R&amp;R is an essential concomitant to water sector development.&#13;
Orissa has large remaining potential for such development, and it is inherently in Orissa's best&#13;
interests that the social aspects are well-catered for, not only for the primary and well-recognized&#13;
reason that it is intrinsically right and socially just to do so, but because infrastructure development&#13;
options are constrained when this aspect is not well handled. Sustained commitment is thus&#13;
intended by GOO.&#13;
47.     An important need to safeguard against shortfalls due to possible implementation&#13;
weaknesses will be that the program is well monitored and regularly evaluated for its impact, so&#13;
that adjustments and remedial actions can be taken by GOO as needed. This need has been&#13;
integrated in the R&amp;R Action Plan, which includes both monitoring by the R&amp;R Directorate and&#13;
use of Independent Consultants (para 36) for regular M&amp;E and special evaluations.&#13;

Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan Matrix&#13;
(Summary of Objectives and Action Points)&#13;
Overall Objectives:&#13;
-     Ensure that WRCP project affected persons are restored to their former living&#13;
standards or better on a sustainable basis.&#13;
-     Ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects resulting from the&#13;
project and that they receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits. (Refer&#13;
also to Indigenous Peoples Development Plan at Annex 11).&#13;
Under the WRCP, an additional objective is to establish an institutional and&#13;
procedural capacity for any future land acquisition, resettlement and economic&#13;
rehabilitation in the water resources sector, thus providing benefits beyond the specific&#13;
needs of the WRCP.&#13;
Overall Actions:&#13;
-     Establish a complete institutional structure within the Department of Water&#13;
Resources to handle Land Acquisition. Resettlement and Economic Rehabilitation.&#13;
(completed)&#13;
-     Includes creation of a government structure at the Department, District, Project&#13;
and field levels, with staff, equipment, training and technical assistance, coordination&#13;
mechanisms and implementation support for NGOs.&#13;
-     Adjust policies, procedures, and entitlements for PAPs/PDPs (including tribals.&#13;
landless, tenant farmers and encroachers) to ensure full and fair compensation. prompt and&#13;
just resettlement, and economic rehabilitation for sustainable welfare and livelihoods.&#13;
(completed in the new Orissa State Policy issued September 1994 and as further clarified&#13;
by GOO for encroachers in September 1995.)&#13;
-     Implement land acquisition. resettlement, economic rehabilitation and indigenous&#13;
people's action plans at all WRCP project sites. Completed site-specific socio-economic&#13;
surveys. resettlement, rehabilitation and indigenous people's action plans (finalized for all&#13;

(a)  Develop the organizational           Organizational Structure Established&#13;
framework for managing land          during Project Preparation (refer&#13;
acquisition and resettlement and     organigram at Attachment 3). This&#13;
rehabilitation. Project to provide   comprises an R&amp;R Directorate in&#13;
adequate resources to implement      DOWR, assisted by Negotiation&#13;
the resettlement and economic        Committees and Rehabilitation Advisory&#13;
rehabilitation action plans (RAPs).  Committees at the District Levels, special&#13;
staff allocated to each project site and&#13;
use of NGOs for field implementation of&#13;
site-specific resettlement action plans&#13;
(RAPs). Summary details are: (i) an&#13;
R&amp;R Directorate within DOWR headed&#13;
by a Director of senior rank (Additional&#13;
Secretary) reporting directly to the&#13;
Secretary DOWR. The Directorate is&#13;
responsible for carrying out GOO&#13;
policies on land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement and economic rehabilitation&#13;
for the water resources sector, including&#13;
planning, coordination, implementation,&#13;
and monitoring (with evaluation by&#13;
independent consultants, for contracting&#13;
with, and overseeing NGO's&#13;
implementation of the RAPs for each&#13;
field site, and assisting PAPs in investing&#13;
in productive assets.&#13;
(ii) A Purchase Committee chaired by the&#13;
subproject Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation officer with members&#13;
representing the local community and the&#13;
PAPs concerned will assist PAPs to&#13;
purchase appropriate lands from private&#13;
sources in cases where the state is unable&#13;
to provide land or where the land offered&#13;
is not acceptable to the PAP on valid&#13;
grounds.&#13;

reviewing all aspects of site-specific&#13;
RAPs to ensure effective implementation,&#13;
to identify bottlenecks and propose&#13;
measures to resolve them, to undertake&#13;
inspection of land earmarked for&#13;
resettlement colonies, dispense advice for&#13;
improvement of common facilities at&#13;
resettlement colonies, resolve PAP&#13;
grievances related to resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation, and safeguard against&#13;
deterioration of physical and social&#13;
environment. (iii) PAPs access to courts&#13;
for redressal of grievances is built into&#13;
the Land Acquisition Act, but for&#13;
speedier out-of-court disposal of&#13;
grievances relating to awards and&#13;
payment of compensation, PAPs have&#13;
recourse to local Lok Adalats which are&#13;
constituted for this specific purpose. (iv)&#13;
On-Site implementation is under the&#13;
direction of a Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation officer/Special Land&#13;
Acquisition Officer with support from&#13;
NGOs/Community Workers for field&#13;
implementation of site-specific RAPs,&#13;
and assistance to PAPs in obtaining&#13;
access to existing government poverty&#13;
alleviation programs.&#13;
(b)   Community Participation and          PAPs including local host communities&#13;
Integration with Host Population    have been integrally involved in the&#13;
preparation of socio-economic surveys&#13;
and RAPs. Census survey of PAPs was&#13;
based on personal contacts and&#13;
interviews with individuals and families&#13;
affected, including women, and all&#13;
categories of landless. Detailed&#13;
discussions were held with PAPs,&#13;
individually or in groups, to elicit their&#13;
inputs, particularly with regard to their&#13;
preference for the type of economic&#13;
rehabilitation interventions. These have&#13;
been incorporated in the RAPs.&#13;

(c)  Socio-Economic Survey                Detailed baseline socio-economic surveys&#13;
have been completed for all sites:&#13;
Badanala, Harabanghi, Hariharjore,&#13;
Rengali, Upper Jonk, Baghua and&#13;
Mahanadi-Chitrotpala. The socio-&#13;
economic surveys covered full&#13;
inventories of PAPs and their socio-&#13;
economic profile, household&#13;
characteristics, full resources base, extent&#13;
of land loss, and impact of land loss on&#13;
incomes and on public and social&#13;
infrastructure. In the case of landless&#13;
PAPs including landless laborers,&#13;
encroachers, tenant farmers and&#13;
sharecroppers, the surveys also included&#13;
a measurement of impact and extent of&#13;
lost economic opportunities as a result of&#13;
the project. The surveys involved PAPs&#13;
participation and included focus group&#13;
discussions with PAPs or their&#13;
representatives, and community leaders.&#13;
(d)  Legal and Institutional Framework    The State uses the Land Acquisition Act&#13;
of 1984 (LAA) as a basis for determining&#13;
land compensation. In early 1994, GOO&#13;
constituted an Inter-Departmental&#13;
Working Group to review its existing&#13;
compendium of Government Resolutions&#13;
governing R&amp;R. The Working Group's&#13;
primary objective was to prepare a&#13;
revised R&amp;R policy for the irrigation&#13;
sector consistent with the requirements&#13;
of the Bank's ODs on involuntary&#13;
resettlement and indigenous peoples.&#13;
The R&amp;R policy took effect on&#13;
September 1, 1994. The R&amp;R policy&#13;
provides a legal framework for defining&#13;
project affected persons, their rights,&#13;
privileges and entitlements to benefits&#13;
and remuneration, grievance procedures,&#13;
involvement of non-governmental&#13;
organizations and community groups and&#13;
others, representing project affected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

persons in all stages of the R&amp;R and&#13;
economic rehabilitation process. The&#13;
R&amp;R policy contains a number of&#13;
provisions for tribals to allow them to&#13;
retain their previous way of life, ie.&#13;
providing resettlement sites as close as&#13;
possible, and similar to their area of&#13;
displacement. Another felt need was&#13;
creation of an institutional structure to&#13;
implement R&amp;R in the water sector. In&#13;
August 1994, a permanent&#13;
R&amp;R Directorate was established in the&#13;
DOWR that would be responsible for&#13;
carrying out GOO's R&amp;R policy in the&#13;
water resources sector. In the course of&#13;
project preparation further institutional&#13;
strengthening was achieved. The R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate was fully staffed and&#13;
Rehabilitation Advisory Committees, and&#13;
field implementation and on-site&#13;
arrangements were established.&#13;
(e)  Alternative Sites and Selection        As far as possible, adequate and suitable&#13;
resettlement colonies are to be situated in&#13;
the command area of the water resource&#13;
project to enable project affected persons&#13;
to benefit from irrigation and as close as&#13;
possible to the area of displacement and&#13;
in as similar surroundings as possible&#13;
where income-earning opportunities&#13;
exist. Where this is not possible, the&#13;
project will provide for development of&#13;
land, where technically feasible, for&#13;
irrigation facilities (minor, lift pumps),&#13;
for commercial and other forest-based&#13;
income opportunities, etc. The R&amp;R&#13;
policy advocates involvement of project&#13;
affected persons or their representative,&#13;
and non-governmental voluntary&#13;
organizations, in the selection process for&#13;
resettlement colonies. Initial experience&#13;
with this approach under the project&#13;
indicates that R&amp;R is much more&#13;
satisfactory if the PAPs and PDPs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

themselves, with assistance of NGOs,&#13;
make these choices.&#13;
(f)  Valuation and Compensation for      Under the Land Acquisition Act the state&#13;
Lost Assets and Entitlements         commits to pay the market price for the&#13;
(including land-for-land provisions  land to be acquired, and, recognizing the&#13;
and benefits for landless laborers,  involuntary nature of land acquisition,&#13;
tenant farmers, sharecroppers and    provides a 30 percent solatium, including&#13;
encroachers)                         interest at the prevailing rate in case of&#13;
delays in payment of compensation for&#13;
land acquired. The LAA also provides&#13;
for land-owning PAPs whose land/and or&#13;
homestead or part thereof have been&#13;
acquired for the purpose of the project&#13;
have (personally or through an NGO&#13;
representing them) the option to request&#13;
negotiated settlement. If it does not&#13;
result in a "consent award" then normal&#13;
land acquisition procedures are followed.&#13;
Under the R&amp;R policy, land-owning&#13;
PAPs are also entitled to two other forms&#13;
of remuneration, namely: Rehabilitation&#13;
Assistance and Maintenance Allowance.&#13;
The displaced landless, including&#13;
landless laborers and sharecroppers,&#13;
encroachers, and tenant farmers are also&#13;
entitled to the Rehabilitation Assistance&#13;
and Maintenance Allowance. Under the&#13;
Rehabilitation Assistance, there are two&#13;
options available to PAPs. One option is&#13;
the provision of productively comparable&#13;
land for land identified by the PAPs&#13;
within a specific time frame and well-&#13;
defined geographic area near the village&#13;
or in the command. The terms of&#13;
replacement would be on the basis of one&#13;
acre of unirrigated land lost to one acre&#13;
of unirrigated replacement land or one&#13;
half acre of irrigated replacement land,&#13;
up to a maximum of two acres of&#13;
replacement irrigated land or four acres if&#13;
unirrigated.&#13;
As a second option, PAPs may&#13;
elect to receive Rehabilitation Assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Grants (RAG) of Rs. 20,000 per acre of&#13;
irrigated land or Rs. 10,000 per acre if&#13;
unirrigated, for purchase of productive&#13;
assets. The rehabilitation assistance,&#13;
which will be adjusted for inflation, will&#13;
be awarded jointly in favor of the PAPs&#13;
and his or her spouse. The amount&#13;
would be deposited in a joint bank&#13;
account with withdrawal against&#13;
signatures of the PAP and his or her&#13;
spouse, the NGO, and the RRO.&#13;
Withdrawals would be linked to purchase&#13;
of productive assets, excluding land, such&#13;
as farm animals, agricultural implements,&#13;
or for self-employment, or other income-&#13;
generating activities (e.g. transport,&#13;
equipment for small business or craft,&#13;
etc.) These two options are also&#13;
available to all project affected persons&#13;
including those affected by partial land&#13;
acquisition and whose remaining land is&#13;
deemed uneconomically viable or&#13;
completely inaccessible.&#13;
Landless PAPs including landless&#13;
laborers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers&#13;
and encroachers who lose their right to&#13;
cultivate land they are encroaching upon&#13;
will be provided agricultural land. Where&#13;
no agricultural land is available, they will&#13;
be provided wasteland or degraded forest&#13;
land up to four acres per head of&#13;
household for commercial plantation&#13;
with cost of plantation development to&#13;
be borne by the project. Land cost will&#13;
be borne by GOO.&#13;
Encroachers on objectionable lands&#13;
will be treated as landless PAPs/PDPs&#13;
under the policy and will be entitled to&#13;
full R&amp;R benefits. These are spelled out&#13;
in Appendix I to this matrix.&#13;
Where the land offered is not&#13;
acceptable to PAPs on valid grounds, the&#13;
State will assist PAPs to purchase from&#13;
the proceeds of their Rehabilitation&#13;

private sources with assistance from a&#13;
Purchase Committee chaired by the&#13;
subproject Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation Officer with members&#13;
representing the local community and the&#13;
PAPs concerned. The cost of land will&#13;
be borne by the project. (government -&#13;
financed). The State will provide&#13;
reimbursement of registration fee and&#13;
stamp duty if replacement land is&#13;
purchased within three years of receipt of&#13;
Rehabilitation Assistance Grant.&#13;
Displaced PAPs choosing either the&#13;
land-for-land option or the Rehabilitation&#13;
Assistance Grant option will also be&#13;
entitled to a supplemental Maintenance&#13;
allowance of Rs. 500 per month from the&#13;
date of displacement through a period of&#13;
one year. For PAPs being provided land&#13;
in the command area, the maintenance&#13;
allowance would be extended for two&#13;
additional years to provide support&#13;
during the period when water is not&#13;
available for irrigation. The purpose of&#13;
the Maintenance Allowance, which&#13;
would be funded by GOO, would be to&#13;
compensate for the affected persons' lost&#13;
earnings during the transition period to&#13;
meet basic necessities and ensure that the&#13;
PAPs are not obliged to sell existing&#13;
family assets pending restoration of&#13;
earning ability.&#13;
Displaced PAPs losing their&#13;
homestead will be entitled to either: 0.2&#13;
acres of homestead land or a cash grant&#13;
of Rs. 20,000 in lieu of homestead land,&#13;
to be borne by GOO, and Rs. 20,000&#13;
home construction allowance funded&#13;
under the project.&#13;
Under the WRCP project, PAPs&#13;

provided under the 1994 policy.&#13;
Tribal PAPs/PDPs will be entitled&#13;
to the full R&amp;R benefits spelled out in&#13;
the RAPs, and as described above, as for&#13;
non-tribal PAPs/PDPs. Based on the&#13;
socio-economic surveys, special features&#13;
have been built into the RAPs to cater to&#13;
the particular socio-cultural and&#13;
economic needs of tribal PAPs/PDPs.&#13;
Measures adopted include particular&#13;
attention to relocation sites, where&#13;
access to forest land is an important&#13;
need, and specific features in the RAPs&#13;
catering to the individual and community&#13;
needs of tribal families. These include&#13;
infrastructure facilities based on&#13;
identified tribal needs, selection of&#13;
economic rehabilitation activities tailored&#13;
to the individual needs of each tribal&#13;
family, selection of government&#13;
development schemes with a tribal&#13;
development focus, and selection of&#13;
NGOs with experience in working with&#13;
tribals. Additionally, at each project&#13;
location an Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan (IPDP) has been&#13;
prepared, catering to the additional&#13;
community and other needs of&#13;
indigenous peoples (refer IPDP at Annex&#13;
11).&#13;
(g)  Land Tenure, Acquisition and          Based on the results of socio-economic&#13;
Transfer                              surveys, many landless persons will be&#13;
affected by the project, among them&#13;
sharecroppers, encroachers and tenant&#13;
farmers. As such they will be entitled to&#13;
rehabilitation assistance either in the form&#13;
of land or cash grant for purchase of land&#13;
or creation of productive assets. In&#13;
addition, landless displaced persons&#13;
losing their homes will be entitled to&#13;
homestead land or cash grant in lieu&#13;

Landless PAPs, including&#13;
encroachers, tenant farmers, and&#13;
sharecroppers, who lose their right to&#13;
cultivate land they are encroaching upon&#13;
will be provided agricultural land. Where&#13;
no agricultural land is available, they will&#13;
be provided wasteland or degraded forest&#13;
land up to four acres per head of&#13;
household for commercial plantation&#13;
with cost of plantation development to&#13;
be borne by the project. Land ownership&#13;
will be recorded jointly in the name of&#13;
both the PAP and his/her spouse. (Refer&#13;
para. (f) above.)&#13;
(h)  Access to Training, Employment      NGOs and RROs working with Rural&#13;
and Credit                          Development Department and other line&#13;
departments will assist PAPs in obtaining&#13;
access to existing government programs&#13;
(forestry, dairy, extension, etc.) and&#13;
poverty alleviation schemes. These&#13;
include, among others, self-employment&#13;
schemes under the Integrated Rural&#13;
Development Program (IRDP), and&#13;
various special developmental schemes.&#13;
The ongoing Shrimp and Fish Culture&#13;
project will target WRCP PAPs for its&#13;
fisheries income-generating schemes in&#13;
Harabanghi and Badanala where the&#13;
project currently operates, and in the&#13;
following reservoirs to be included in the&#13;
ongoing project's expanded scope:&#13;
Baghua, Upper Jonk, Rengali and&#13;
Harijharjore.&#13;
(i)  Shelter, Infrastructure and Social  Displaced PAPs have the option to&#13;
Services                            resettle in government-sponsored&#13;
colonies or in resettlement areas of their&#13;
choice. The object is to complete&#13;
resettlement way in advance of&#13;
commencement of impounding of the&#13;
reservoirs. Thus, preparation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10&#13;

well-orchestrated effort by DOWR&#13;
consultants, R&amp;R Directorate Staff and&#13;
Project Engineers, and Field&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officers&#13;
with PAPs or their NGO representative.&#13;
In government-sponsored colonies, the&#13;
following civic amenities, funded under&#13;
the project, will be provided: schools,&#13;
drinking wells, village ponds, community&#13;
centers, dispensaries, linkage to main or&#13;
all-weather roads, and electrification.&#13;
Strengthening of infrastructure near or&#13;
around resettlement colonies to cater for&#13;
the needs of host population will also be&#13;
provided and funded.&#13;
Displaced PAPs opting to resettle&#13;
in areas of their choice in groups or&#13;
clusters would be provided with drinking&#13;
water wells, tubewells, and tanks, at the&#13;
minimum, funded under the project, and&#13;
other amenities identified in the socio-&#13;
economic surveys and by the NGOs. In&#13;
both cases strengthening of infrastructure&#13;
near or around resettlement colonies to&#13;
cater for the needs of host population&#13;
and increased demand on existing&#13;
physical and social infrastructure&#13;
resulting from the resettlement will be&#13;
funded under the project.&#13;
(j)  Environmental Protection and        (This topic is comprehensively discussed&#13;

(k)  Implementation and Schedule,        The R&amp;R Directorate in the DOWR will&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation            be responsible for maintaining a system&#13;
of physical and financial reporting to&#13;
track progress on resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation. Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
for each subproject include an&#13;
implementation action plan for land&#13;
acquisition, resettlement and economic&#13;
rehabilitation activities with clear&#13;

monitoring of implementation of the&#13;
RAPs will be developed by the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate and carried out during the&#13;
course of the project supervision. This&#13;
will be supplemented with independent&#13;
monitoring and evaluation by&#13;
independent consultants funded under the&#13;
project. Such independent monitoring&#13;
and evaluation will include an assessment&#13;
of the impact of resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation on the livelihood of PAPs,&#13;
identifying constraints, and&#13;
recommending corrective actions.&#13;
Monitorable indicators are shown at&#13;
Attachment 7. Socio-econornic data&#13;
obtained in the course of the socio-&#13;
economic baseline surveys will form the&#13;
data base for annual and mid-term&#13;
reviews, as appropriate, and for an&#13;
impact evaluation study of the project&#13;

Case C:    Where the person does not lose his encroached homestead land but loses the&#13;
cultivated encroached land in such a way that he becomes landless or he loses a portion of his only&#13;
holding and thereby would be compelled to lead an uneconomic living. Treatment as landless&#13;
Project Affected Person (PAP) for purposes of cultivated land acquired:&#13;
-     provision of land equal to the cultivated area actually lost if unirrigated or&#13;
half the area if irrigated subject to a maximum of 4 acres of uninigated land&#13;
or 2 acres of irrigated land (or, alternatively, at PAP's request, provision of&#13;
rehabilitation assistance). The land lost as on September Ist, 1994 (date of&#13;
inception of R&amp;R policy) will be determined by the baseline survey conducted&#13;
by the NGO engaged in RAP implementation under the project.&#13;
-     access to government programs&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;

Obiective&#13;
1.    The objective of the fisheries sub-component would be to develop freshwater&#13;
fisheries and aquaculture employment opportunities for some project displaced&#13;
families (DF) in the vicinity of six reservoirs suitable for fisheries enhancement.&#13;
The total water area for the six reservoirs that would be developed by the project&#13;
is 8,835 ha (Table 1). In addition to the direct beneficiaries taking up fish&#13;
production activities, it is anticipated that others conducting support activities&#13;
(hatchery operators, feed suppliers, fish traders, ice suppliers, etc.) in the&#13;
project area would also be indirectly benefited. The fisheries sub-component would&#13;
be implemented by the Orissa State Project Unit (OSPU) of the India: Shrimp and&#13;
Fish Culture Project (SFCP) (Cr. 2329). Of the six reservoirs listed in Table 1,&#13;
the first two had been previously identified to have fisheries developed under the&#13;
SFCP with the last four proposed for addition to that project's activities.&#13;

Fish Production Technoloav&#13;
2.    The fish production strategy would involve two stages.  The first stage would&#13;
concern the culture of suitably sized fingerlings (12.5 - 15 cm) for stocking the&#13;
reservoirs, and the second would involve the release and grow-out of fingerlings to&#13;
market-size (0.5 - 1.5 kg each) fish of several species stocked in a proportion&#13;
that would optimally exploit the natural feeds available in the reservoirs. The&#13;
approximate, initial stocking ratio of fish species include catla (Catla catla)&#13;
stocked at 40%, and rohu (Labeo rohita) and mrigal (Cirrhinus mriaala) stocked at&#13;
30%. The catla, rohu, and mrigal are endemic to India and are known as the Indian&#13;
Major Carp (IMC). All of these species are riverine and do not successfully spawn&#13;
in still waters which thus requires annual restocking with the seed derived from&#13;
hatchery produced hatchlings or fry.&#13;
3.    Finaerlina Rearina.  There are three options that could be used for the&#13;
culture of fingerlings -- pond, pen, or floating cage culture. If suitable ponds&#13;
(in good condition or needing minor improvements) are available in the vicinity of&#13;
the reservoirs, it would be best to use these for the culture of fingerlings&#13;
followed by pens and then cages. If suitable areas (seasonal water depth and&#13;
appropriate soil conditions) are available, pens would be the next best option.&#13;
Successful pen culture has been demonstrated in Orissa. If ponds are not available&#13;
and pens are not feasible, floating cages could be used. Effective cage culture&#13;
techniques for fingerling production have been developed by the Central Institute&#13;
for Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) facility in Bangalore. For the project,&#13;
calculations have been made for the pen culture option for which a technically and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

cost effective methodology has been developed in Orissa under the SFCP. The&#13;
investment and operating cost provision could be used for pond improvement (if&#13;
available) or cage culture (if necessary). The cost for pen construction is about&#13;
Rs. 44,000/ha divided into average 0.25 ha units, and the annual operational cost&#13;
is about Rs. 85,000/ha, including all inputs as well as labor. Fry (3-4 cm) of all&#13;
species (para. 2) are stocked at a density of about 250,000/ha-pen with an&#13;
estimated survival rate of 50% to 12.5-15 cm size. Approximately 35.2 ha of pens&#13;
would be required for the 8,835 ha mean reservoir area.&#13;
4.    Reservoir Fisheries.  One production model for reservoir fisheries would be&#13;
used. For this model, fingerlings would be stocked at a density of 500 per ha with&#13;
a production target at full development of 80 kg/ha/yr. The annual&#13;
survival/recovery rates are estimated to be 10% of the number stocked each year.&#13;
The number of fingerlings required for all six reservoirs each year would be about&#13;
4.4 million (165 t), and the total incremental fish production at full development&#13;
would amount to about 700 t/yr at a value of approximately Rs. 11.2 million.&#13;
Growth would be the result of the fingerlings consuming natural feeds available in&#13;
the reservoirs. The types and quantities of fishing gears (i.e. gill nets and&#13;
fishing boats) to be used would be specified by the OSPU, and a closed fishing&#13;
season would be enacted for two months following the stocking of fingerlings. Each&#13;
year's production output, marketed via fish traders at each site, would be&#13;
evaluated to determine the following year's stocking proportion. Each reservoir&#13;
has a pre-existing approach road to a landing site in the proximity of the dam. To&#13;
facilitate marketing, a provision has been provided to construct a 36 square meter,&#13;
fish landing shed at each reservoir at a cost of approximately Rs.100,000 each.&#13;
Number of Potential Beneficiaries&#13;
5.    Approximately 1 traditional country boat would be required per 30 reservoir&#13;
area at a cost of about Rs. 7,500/boat. This would amount to a total of 295 boats.&#13;
If the boats, which usually have two occupants, are shared, approximately 590&#13;
households could benefit. In addition, the 35.2 ha fingerling rearing pens,&#13;
divided into 0.25 ha units, would provide employment for 140 more households with 1&#13;
boat provided per 2 households for pen management. The total number of households&#13;
that could be employed by the sub-component would be 730. As noted in Table 1, the&#13;
potential employment at some reservoirs exceeds that of the number of DFs and at&#13;
others there is a shortfall. Should interest exist among other people in the area,&#13;
or if some DFs where there is a shortfall would be interested in moving to another&#13;
site, priority would be given to DFs with provision from the resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation component for their relocation.&#13;
6.    The average net income would be about Rs. 5,540 per fishing household per&#13;
year and about Rs. 2,600 per pen culture household for about 3 months labor. If it&#13;
is not feasible for 2 DFs to share 1 boat, then the number of beneficiaries would&#13;
be reduced to 435 households. The beneficiaries would largely be derived from&#13;
tribal people adversely affected by the project due to resettlement. The OSPU has&#13;
had success with recruiting, training, and engaging men and women from this social&#13;
group in reservoir fisheries under the SFCP. Preference for fingerling rearing&#13;
would be provided to interested women or groups of women from the DFs.&#13;
Oraanization and Manaaement&#13;
7.    The implementation of the fisheries sub-component (reservoirs and pens) would&#13;
be coordinated by OSPU with the Orissa Department of Fisheries (DOF) and district-&#13;
level Fish Farmers Development Agencies (FFDA). The reservoirs, with fishing&#13;
rights transferred to the DOF, would be leased for a period of 10 years to groups&#13;
(cooperatives) of DFs/fisherfolk who would pay an annual lease fee. The annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Attachment 6&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
lease fees should be set high enough to cover government management costs,&#13;
including (a) those for technical extension, management, and monitoring of the&#13;
reservoirs by district DOF officers; and (b) a fee to the Orissa Irrigation&#13;
Department at the rate of Rs. 2.5/ha/yr for use of the reservoirs. All fees would&#13;
be collected as a fixed, comprehensive fishing license fee of about Rs.10,000/yr&#13;
paid by each fisher that would be collected on a quarterly basis by the&#13;
cooperatives for loan repayment, annual fingerling stocking costs, landing shed&#13;
maintenance, and other management costs. The license fee could be reduced&#13;
following the initial loan repayment period. The DF groups would be responsible&#13;
for rearing and stocking fingerlings and harvesting from the reservoirs. The OSPU&#13;
would coordinate overall fisheries management including fingerling stocking and&#13;
fish landings.&#13;
8.    The OSPU would also involve non-governmental organizations (NGO) working in&#13;
the project area to assist with the identification and organization of groups of&#13;
DFs that would lease and manage the fishery in the reservoirs. The NGOs would also&#13;
assist the beneficiaries with establishing savings accounts to cover the closed&#13;
fishing season, expenditures required for fishing license fees, replacement costs&#13;
for boats, nets, pens, and for fingerling production costs. Fees paid for NGO&#13;
services would be derived from "Technical Assistance and Training' (Table 2) which&#13;
includes Rs. 1,000/DF/yr for the first 4 years at each reservoir.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
9.    In addition to the training provided to the beneficiaries by the Fisheries&#13;
Department's District Fisheries Office staffs and the NGOs under the direction of&#13;
the OSPU, domestic training (i.e. by CIFA and a management institute) would be&#13;
provided for the involved Fisheries Officers and NGO staff in technical,&#13;
organizational, and managerial aspects of reservoir fisheries development. The&#13;
funds for this training would also be derived from that allocated for "Technical&#13;
Assistance and Training.,&#13;
Phasina&#13;
10.   It is anticipated that fisheries activities at each reservoir would be&#13;
initiated upon completion of their construction once filled with water after the&#13;
next fish spawning season. Table 2 has been organized on the basis of all&#13;
fisheries activities beginning in the same year.&#13;
Prolect Cost and Financina&#13;
11.   Table 2 provides investment, operating costs, and financing requirements for&#13;
the sub-component. All costs for the first 4 years would be financed by the IDA&#13;
credit for the SFCP with a cost estimate of Rs. 23 million (US$719,000) with&#13;
estimated physical (10%) but without price contingencies for the 8,835 ha reservoir&#13;
area. The investment and working capital loans at an interest rate of about&#13;
14%/year would be arranged via a tripartite agreement between a Fishers'&#13;
Cooperative or individual fishers in the case of nets and boats, a participation&#13;
bank, the Orissa DOF, and an NGO as has been followed for reservoirs under the&#13;
SFCP. There would be a two-year grace period with the respective interest charges&#13;
capitalized.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    In the State of Orissa, the tribal population is 7.0 million, equal to 22.2 % of the total&#13;
population, as per the census of 1991. The state has the third largest tribal population in India&#13;
amounting to 11% of the total tribal population in India categorized as Scheduled Tribes (ST). The&#13;
tribals mostly inhabit the western hilly regions of the state, mainly in or in close proximity to forests.&#13;
More than 50% of Orissa's tribal population is found in the districts of Koraput, Sundergarh, and&#13;
Mayurbhanj. Koraput alone has 25% of the tribal population in the state.&#13;
2.    Tribals in Orissa, and elsewhere in India, have historically been dependent upon forests, as&#13;
collectors of forest produce, hunters or as podu (shifting) cultivators, and have built up a mutually&#13;
symbiotic relationship. The bulk of tribals in India are now settled agriculturalists. Only around 12%&#13;
can be defined as purely shifting cultivators. In isolated pockets in South India one finds small band&#13;
societies of food gatherers and hunters completely dependent on forests for their survival. Past&#13;
government policies based on revenue earning and regulatory approaches have endangered tribal way&#13;
of life by restricting access to forests. At the same time, government policies have failed to protect&#13;
reserve forests from uncontrolled exploitation and degradation.&#13;
3.    With forests disappearing in Orissa over the last decades, for reasons outside the control of&#13;
tribals, it is no longer possible for tribals to rely exclusively on forests for their livelihood. Settled&#13;
agriculture, and wage labour in particular, are occupations of increasing importance. At present, the&#13;
majority of tribals in Orissa sustain their livelihood by a combination of podu cultivation, collection of&#13;
forest produce, settled agriculture and wage labour, with the two latter occupational categories gaining&#13;
importance. Urban migration is on a gradual increase, although still of limited significance with only&#13;
5.1% of tribals living in urban areas. In areas previously exclusively inhabited by tribals, general castes&#13;
are now entering as settled agriculturalists. With entidements and access to natural resources being&#13;
increasingly curtailed, the tribals of Orissa find themselves in a downward spiral of impoverishment.&#13;
Indigenous People and the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project&#13;
4.    Orissa's future economic development and social welfare requires better management of&#13;
existing water resources, particularly for irrigation, the largest user of water. The project's primary&#13;
objective is to improve the planning, management and development process for the state's water&#13;
resources. The project's immediate objective is to increase agricultural productivity through&#13;
improvement of existing irrigation schemes and completion of viable incomplete schemes.&#13;
5.    The beneficiaries of the project are farmers in the irrigated command areas to be completed or&#13;
rehabilitated. In addition to infrastructural improvements, the project aims at enhancing irrigation&#13;
performance through participatory arrangements and turnover of irrigation management to farmers. By&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
definition it will reach tribal cultivators in the irrigated command areas to be rehabilitated. It is&#13;
assumed that they stand to benefit from the project on terms equal those of non-tribal farmers. The&#13;
project will address the specific situation of tribals in these command areas through the Farmer&#13;
Organization and Tumover (FOT) component.&#13;
6.    Special care will be taken to ensure that implementation of activities in sub-projects to be&#13;
completed does not create adverse effects for tribals who are not immediate beneficiaries of improved&#13;
irrigation facilities. The project will ensure that they receive culturally compatible economic and social&#13;
benefits which will allow them to maintain or improve their standard of living. The project will also&#13;
support informed participation and empowerment among tribals to sustain project induced benefits&#13;
beyond the project period.&#13;
7.    An Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) has been prepared in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Operational Directive 4.20. As part of preparation of the IPDP, a comprehensive socio-&#13;
economic study was carried out in all the sub-project areas with a tribal population. The purpose of the&#13;
study was to determine the present situation in the tribal communities vis-a-vis access to natural&#13;
resources, land tenure, employment, farmer organization, women and gender relations, and poverty in&#13;
general. The study applied several participatory techniques, such as Participatory Rural Appraisal and&#13;
Focus Group Discussions, to anticipate and assess the impact of the project on tribals, their felt needs,&#13;
and to suggest mitigation and community development activities to be carried out according to specific&#13;
plans in each sub-project. Accordingly, support activities to improve tribal's environment and standard&#13;
of living, based on their own participation, were developed. The organizational set-up for the&#13;
implementation of the IPDP was prepared based on an assessment of the current institutional&#13;
arrangements for tribal development programs.&#13;
8.     The IPDP supplements other project activities and GOO's ongoing development programs for&#13;
tribals. It contains mitigation measures for tribals negatively affected by the project through loss of&#13;
land and livelihood, as well as community development activities for those tribals, who are indirectly&#13;
or marginally affected, to enhance the likely positive impact of project activities. The Plan supports&#13;
activities adapted to the needs and environment of tribal communities. It is expected to facilitate their&#13;
participation on an informed basis, and early handover of management of project activities to them.&#13;
Implementation arrangements will build on the existing institutions and community groups. NGOs will&#13;
play a key role in coordination and liaison between communities and the government delivery system.&#13;
Training and capacity building of tribal communities, NGOs and government is given high priority.&#13;
9.    The IPDP will be implemented in six sub-projects to be completed under OWRCP:&#13;
Badanalla; Harihajore; Harabhangi; Upper Jonk; Rengali; and Baghua. The target group includes:&#13;
tribals living within a 5 km radius of the reservoir areas; tribals living inside the command areas; and&#13;
tribal communities within a 2 km radius of the command areas. The seventh sub-project, Mahanadi-&#13;
Chitrotpala, located in the eastem coastal part of Orissa, is not included in the Plan since the tribal&#13;
population is only 55 (11 households), equal to 0.1% of the total population in the sub-project area.&#13;
Background of Tribal People in the IPDP Project Areas&#13;
10.   There are 62 communities listed as Scheduled Tribes (ST) in Orissa under the provision of the&#13;
Indian Constitution. More than 80% of them live in designated scheduled areas. There are 22 tribal&#13;
groups in the six IPDP sub-project areas. Out of these, five are in the category of major tribes. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204 -&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
total tribal population in the six sub-projects is 56,808 persons. The three sub-projects of Harabhangi,&#13;
Badanala, and Upper Jonk have the largest concentrations of tribal population. The Khond, Gond and&#13;
Saura are by far the largest tribal groups in the IPDP project areas.&#13;

11.   The Kondh population in Orissa is about 1 million (1981). It is the largest tribal group in the&#13;
state, constituting 17.5 % of the total ST population in the state. Kondhs are subdivided into a number&#13;
of endogamous groups: Dongria Kondh; Kutia Kondh; Malua Kondh; Pengo Kondh; and Desia&#13;
Kondh. The Gond constitute about 10% of the tribal population. They are divided into two different&#13;
groups: the Hinduized and Oriya speaking Gonds in Sundergarh, Sambalpur, Bolangir and parts of&#13;
Kalahandi districts, and the more traditional and Gundi (Dravidian) speaking Gonds of Koraput and&#13;
part of Kalahandi districts. The Saora is the oldest known tribe in Orissa. They live im all districts of&#13;
the state and constitute about 6% of the total tribal population. Some have converted to Christianity.&#13;
There is a high concentration of Saoras in Ganjam and Koraput districts, particularly in Paralekimrundi-&#13;
and Gunupur subdivisions forming a contiguous tract of "Saora land", part of which is within the&#13;
OWRCP project areas of Harabhangi and Badanalla.&#13;
12.   Tribal Communities: The tribal population in Orissa is among the poorest, most vulnerable and&#13;
exploited groups in the state. Most tribal communities are confined to the more hilly and remote areas&#13;
of the state. These areas have been the habitat for some tribes for centuries, whereas others have been&#13;
slowly driven out of the more fertile plains by non-tribals in more recent times. Historically, tribals&#13;
have had a lifestyle characterized by close dependency on the forests for pgdu cultivation, collection of&#13;
forest produce and hunting. Concepts of money management, savings and planning have traditionally&#13;
not been of major importance, although the highly developed mixed cropping strategies in podu&#13;
cultivation witness conscious strategies of risk-aversion and ecological adaption. The average literacy&#13;
rate among tribals is 22% (about 10% for tribal women), much lower than the state average of 41%.&#13;
Matemal, child and infant mortality rates are extremely high among tribal communities.&#13;
13.   Tribals have never lived in total isolation from the surrounding society. During feudal times,&#13;
many tribal communities were integrated as subjects, tenants and, in a few cases, even warriors under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the smaller rulers and zamindars. The relationship was one between patron and client. Although it&#13;
contained a good amount of exploitation of tribals through taxation in kind, it did not challenge the&#13;
social and cultural integrity of the various tribal communities. In fact, the rulers and zamindars&#13;
depended on the tribal communities for territorial control, access to forest produce, taxation and&#13;
defense. With the abolition of the zamindari system, and its feudal arrangements, tribals became the&#13;
immediate subjects and tenants under the state. As such tribal communities have lost the feudal&#13;
patronage and became exposed to non-tribal infringement on their customary rights to land and forests.&#13;
However, a number of national and state level legislative measures since Independence have been&#13;
enacted to protect the traditional entitlements of tribals.&#13;
14.   Land tenure. The livelihood and survival of tribals largely rests on their access to land and&#13;
forests. The legal status of tribal land is at times complex, and takes many different forms. Tenure&#13;
may be in the form of individual ownership based on legal rights (pattarvoti rights). It may constitute&#13;
usufructuary rights (i.e. right to collect fruits, leaves, waste wood and timber, etc.) to common property&#13;
lands, usually set aside for grazing or orchards. In addition to these two categories of tenure, tribals&#13;
cultivate a considerable amount of so-called encroached land Encroached land is divided into two&#13;
categories: govemment land not yet surveyed and settled. Such land is also labelled "non-&#13;
objectionable" govemment land which is mainly cultivable waste (Abada Yogva Anabadi). Podu&#13;
(shifting) cultivation is often carried out on cultivable waste or other category forest land on hill slopes.&#13;
However, podu is not allowed on reserve forest land, except at the discretion of the Forest Settlement&#13;
Officer. The law entitles ownership (patta) to tribals who have cultivated non-objectionable&#13;
govemment land continuously for at least 12 years. Another category of encroached land is labelled&#13;
"objectionable", and include e.g. land set aside by government for development purposes, gochar&#13;
(community grazing) land, orchard land, and other land for public use.&#13;
15.   Tribal Economy: The tribal economy is primarily subsistence oriented and based upon a&#13;
combination of agriculture, forestry and wage labour. Although tribals are mainly dependent on&#13;
agriculture, collection of forests continue to play a major role in household consumption and income&#13;
generation. But the dependence of tribals on forest resources varies from area to area In some areas&#13;
with serious deforestation, such as Koraput district, collection of forest produce is now of declining&#13;
importance for the tribal economy. In other areas, typically in the interior valleys of dense forests, cash&#13;
earnings from non-timber forest produce such as sal and tendu leafs (for plates and bidis) is still of&#13;
some importance for the household economy. The general pattem is that there is more dependence on&#13;
forests among the podu cultivators, pastoralists and hunter-gatherers, and least among the settled&#13;
agriculturalists.&#13;
16.   With the decline in output from forest produce, as well as podu cultivation, tribals are&#13;
increasingly becoming dependent on seasonal wage labour, both as agnicultural and unskilled&#13;
construction workers. Tribals are usually paid the minimum daily wage of Rs 25 (fixed by&#13;
govemment), although there is evidence of tribal women being paid less than that. Although difficult&#13;
to establish in monetary terms, the income of most tribal households is substantially lower (4-5.000 Rs&#13;
annual income) than the official poverty line of Rs I 1.000.&#13;
17.   Natural Resources and Agriculture: Forests are considered common property by tribal&#13;
communities and are shared equally. Tribals have a strong sense of attachment to the forest as their&#13;
ancestral territory. They maintain de facto usufructuary rights to the forests products and to podu&#13;
cultivation in certain designated zones on hill slopes, irrespective of the legal status of the land/forest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 206 -&#13;
Annex I I&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
However, tribals do not usually practise podu in forests declared as Reserve Forests and their&#13;
collection of forest produce is restricted. Apart from firewood and wood for house construction, the&#13;
other major forest products upon which tribals are dependent, are honey, tendu and sal leafs, mahula&#13;
(madhuca indica), tola (oil seeds). As an example of community forest management, tendu trees are&#13;
pruned by the entire village and leaves collected by individuals are sold to the Forest Department or in&#13;
the local markets.&#13;
18.   Both podu and settled agriculture is characterized by poor soil quality, traditional technology,&#13;
crop rotation, and fallow periods. Apart from indigenous systems of terracing and check dams&#13;
(munda) in the up-hill areas, tribals have little access to government sponsored irrigation schemes.&#13;
Most settled agriculture is carried out on the lower hill slopes which are usually not included in the&#13;
larger irrigation schemes. Agricultural practices are characterized by rain-fed annual cropping, both on&#13;
settled agricultural land and podu land on the higher hill slopes. The common annual food crops are&#13;
millet, sorghum, maize and pulses.&#13;
19.   Hill slopes suitable for podu cultivation are usually defined as common property of a particular&#13;
village community, and the boundaries of the particular area is well defined in relation to neighbouring&#13;
areas cultivated by other villages. The individual households cultivation on the podu land have&#13;
usufructuary rights. The area cultivated by a household depends on a mixture of the following factors:&#13;
(i) available household work force; (ii) status in the community; and (iii) mutual agreement between&#13;
household, often govemed by the village elders or leader(s). There is a clear, and unequal, gender&#13;
division of labour in podu cultivation, with men doing the land clearing and women doing all other&#13;
agricultural operations. A household typically cultivates more than one small patch of land at a time.&#13;
When soil fertility is reduced, the cultivator shifts to another area. The ideal regeneration period for the&#13;
land is 10-12 years, but with increasing pressure on land cultivators now usually return to the same plot&#13;
after only two to three years. In some cases cultivation even becomes permanent, resulting in soil&#13;
degradation and very low productivity.&#13;
20.   Social Organization: Most tribal villages in the project areas consist of compact settlements&#13;
with close-knit and lineage based communities located near or inside the forest. The habitation pattem&#13;
itself reflects the strong social organization in most tribal communities. Village leaders and elders,&#13;
sometimes formally organized in traditional village councils, are quite powerful in terms of intemal&#13;
cohesion and jurisdiction. This leadership coexist with the statutory panchayats, but since a panchayat&#13;
usually covers more than one village, authority in each tribal village is still vested in the traditional&#13;
tribal leaders. When a traditional village leader is also sarpanch and member of a panchayat, this&#13;
usually means mere prestige for the village and the possibility of access to extemal resources for local&#13;
development.&#13;
21.   Status of Women: Tribal women play a more vital role for household affairs and the economic&#13;
survival of families, than non-tribal women. Tribal women contribute the major part of the labour&#13;
required for agriculture and collection of forest produce. In addition they take up wage labour&#13;
whenever available. In extreme cases, observed in the Harabhangi project area, tribal women even&#13;
work night shifts in canal and tunnel excavation for the irrigation project. Women are usually paid less&#13;
than men for the same labour time. In social and household matters, the status of tribal women is&#13;
generally higher that of non-tribals. They are often viewed by outsiders as "strong" and "independent".&#13;
But their relative "freedom", and visibility far away from villages, is tied to a very heavy work burden,&#13;
and they usually have little influence on village level decision making.&#13;

Legal Framework&#13;
22.   National level leeislation for Scheduled Tribes in India. Scheduled Tribes of India are&#13;
conceived as one of the weaker sections of the Indian population. The Constitution of India provides&#13;
an elaborate framework for the socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes and for preventing&#13;
their exploitation by other groups of the society. The three-pronged framework include: (a) goals and&#13;
objectives are set out in Article 46; (b) legislative and protective framework in Schedule; and (c)&#13;
financial support in Article 275.&#13;
23.    The Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 46) directs the state to "promote with&#13;
special care the educational and economic interest of the weaker sections of the people and in&#13;
particular, of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice&#13;
and all forms of exploitation". In article 41, the state is required to make effective provisions "for&#13;
securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age,&#13;
sickness and disablement, and in cases of undeserved want". Involuntary resettlement of tribal&#13;
population from original habitat, would constitute an "undeserved want".&#13;
24.   The Fundamental Rights of the Constitution are applicable to all Indian people, and ensures&#13;
equality before the law (Article 14), prohibits the state to discriminate on grounds of religion, race,&#13;
caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15), ensures equal opportunity of public employment (Article 16),&#13;
abolished "untouchability", ensures freedom of speech and movement, etc. Both the Fundamental&#13;
Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy apply to all peoples of India. However, the&#13;
Constitution also provides specific provisions for protection of the weaker sections from exploitation,&#13;
and ensures that they can avail of educational and employment opportunities. These special provisions&#13;
are characterized sometimes as Compensatory Privileges, Protective Discrimination or Affirmative&#13;
Action. Article 342 deals with mechanism of scheduling tribes by the President of India in consultation&#13;
with the Govemor of the State, i.e. Govemment of India in consultation with the State Govenmment.&#13;
The Constitution makes a distinction between the tribal people to be administered in Scheduled Areas&#13;
and those to be administered in Tribal Areas under the Sixth Schedule (North-Eastem States).&#13;
25.   Scheduling in Orissa comes under the Fifth Schedule, which provides for:&#13;
(a)    An annual report to be presented by the Govemor of the State to the President of&#13;
India regarding the administration of scheduled areas in that state, and the right of&#13;
the Union Govemment to give directions to the states as to the administration of&#13;
the area.&#13;
(b)   The establishment of a Tribes Advisory Council at the state level to advise on&#13;
matters such as the welfare and advancement of Scheduled Tribes that may be&#13;
referred to them by the Govemor.&#13;
(c)    The right of the Govemor to direct that any Act of Parliament or of the State&#13;
Legislature may not apply to the scheduled area or any part thereof or could apply&#13;
with modifications as noticed.&#13;
(d)    Framing regulations prohibiting or restricting the transfer of land by or among&#13;
members of STs in the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Page 7 of 18&#13;
(e)   Framing regulations to regulate money lenders to STs.&#13;
26.   Article 275 provides for grants to be made to States by the Union Government to enable them&#13;
to meet the cost of Government-approved schemes to promote the welfare of STs or to raise the level&#13;
of administration of scheduled areas in the State. Besides the above, Article 330, 332 and 243-D&#13;
provides for reservation of seats in the House of the people and in the Legislative Assemblies of the&#13;
States and in local elected bodies (Panchayat). Article 164 makes a special provision for a Minister in&#13;
charge of Tribal Welfare in Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
27.   State Level Legislation in Orissa. Under the powers vested under the Fifth Schedule, the&#13;
following regulations have been promulgated in the State of Orissa:&#13;
(a)   The Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (by Scheduled&#13;
Tribes) Regulation, 1956, as amended in 1993. Under Section 3 (1) alienation&#13;
of tribal land to other than ST is prohibited, unless pernitted in writing by&#13;
competent authority. Under Sections 3(2) and 3(a), illegal alienation and&#13;
unauthorized occupied tribal land shall be restores to the tribal owners. The&#13;
competent authority, now vested with the Tahsildar, has been authorized to initiate&#13;
proceedings on application by any interested party and to evict unauthorised&#13;
persons occupying tribal land. In addition, Officers on Special Duty (Land&#13;
Reforms) have been posted at Sundargarh, Panposh, Balliguda, Parlekhemundi and&#13;
Koraput exclusively for disposal of such land alienation cases.&#13;
(b)   The Orissa Scheduled Areas Money lender's Regulation 1967 for controlling&#13;
and regulating money lending operative in scheduled areas. Besides these two&#13;
Regulations, specifically enacted by the Tribes Advisory Council, the following&#13;
Acts of Orissa State have been made operative in scheduled areas:&#13;
(c)   The Orissa Debt Relief Act, 1980 provides relief to ST debtors, by making the&#13;
loans contracted by small farrners, rural artisans and agricultural labourers before&#13;
the commencement of the Act as deemed to have been wholly discharged. The&#13;
properties pledged by a ST debtor shall be released in favour of the debtor&#13;
forthwith on commencement of the Act. The civil Courts have been barred from&#13;
entertaining any suit or proceedings in debt recovery. For this purpose, Sub-&#13;
Collectors and Tahsildars have been empowered to dispose of cases as Judicial&#13;
Magistrates in summary trial.&#13;
(d)   The Bonded labour System Abolition Act, 1976 aims at liberating and&#13;
rehabilitating bonded labourers among the ST.&#13;
(e)   The Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 (section 22 and 23) apply to the ST&#13;
population living outside the scheduled areas and protects them from land&#13;
alienation. No tribal land can be transferred to a person not belonging to the same&#13;
community without the written permission of the Revenue Officer. (About 45% of&#13;
the area of the state is declared as scheduled area with 62 different tribal groups.)&#13;

(f)    The Orissa Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (for SC&#13;
(Scheduled Caste) and ST) Act, 1975 makes provision of reservation of posts&#13;
for SC (16.25%) and STs (22.50%) for initial appointments and promotions in&#13;
State Government and other authorities under their control. The amended Section&#13;
4 of the Act reserves one third of posts in Class II, m and IV for women in direct&#13;
recruitment from these scheduled categories.&#13;
Existing Tribal Development Administration&#13;
28.   The Department of Welfare, headed by a Minister of State, is responsible for the development&#13;
and welfare of Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes. Administratively it is&#13;
headed by the Commissioner-cum-secretary of the Department, under whom three Directors-cum-&#13;
Additional Secretaries are heading the wings of the department for the development of each of the&#13;
above groups.&#13;
29.   As stipulated in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, a Tribes Advisory Council has been&#13;
existing in Orissa since 1950. The Orissa Tribes Advisory Council Rules of 1950 guide the&#13;
functioning of the Council. The council has up to 20 members, of whom three fourths are Scheduled&#13;
Tribal Members of the State Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister is the Chairman, the Minister&#13;
of State the Vice-Chairman, and the Secretary of the Department of Welfare is the Secretary. The&#13;
Tribes Advisory Council advises GOO in all matters regarding tribal development and welfare. The&#13;
council will examine the applicability of State and Central laws to the Scheduled Areas, delineate the&#13;
boundary of the Scheduled areas, recommend new regulations or propose revisions of the Schedule of&#13;
the Scheduled Tribes.&#13;
30.   Scheduled Areas constitute more than 44% of Orissa. They cover 67 per cent of the tribal&#13;
population (118 Blocks in 12 Districts). All Blocks with a tribal population of 50 per cent or more are&#13;
defined as Scheduled Areas, and constitute a Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) area. A TSP receives funds&#13;
specially allocated for tribal development from all departments, and is administered by the district level&#13;
Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA). Each Integrated Tribal Development Project under the&#13;
ITDA is headed by a full-time Project Administrator who reports to a Project Level Committee, a sub-&#13;
project under the District Welfare Committees (with the District Collector as Chairman and the District&#13;
Welfare Officer as Secretary). The District Welfare Committee reviews the implementation of tribal&#13;
projects. At the Block level, the Welfare Extension Officer and the Block Development Officer&#13;
(BDO), execute the various tribal projects within the Block, and are responsible for residential schools&#13;
for tribals.&#13;
31.   In Blocks outside the TSP, where a population pocket is 10,000 or more, and where 50% or&#13;
more are tribals, the Modified Area Development Approach (MADA) is adopted to ensure the&#13;
development and welfare of scheduled tribes. 47 Blocks in Orissa are covered by MADA. In still&#13;
smaller pockets of tribal concentration (population of 5,000 of which minimum 50% are tribals are&#13;
covered under the cluster approach. Presently 12 Blocks have identified such clusters. Besides these&#13;
comprehensive programs, there are several other projects (e.g. 13 Micro Projects) assisting scheduled&#13;
tribes in securing rights, maintaining traditions and improve the socio-economic conditions.&#13;

Effects of the OWRCP on Indigenous Peoples&#13;
32.    As in the case of other large irrigation projects in India, tribals in this project area are also&#13;
affected since their traditional habitat is in the hills, where dams and reservoirs are located. Tribals are&#13;
immediately affected by the project by submergence of their agricultural lands, forests, roads and&#13;
pathways, village infrastructure and individual homesteads as reservoirs build. The project is&#13;
responsible for the R&amp;R of tribals as PAPs from the submerged areas according to GOO's R&amp;R&#13;
policy. Tribals within a radius of 5 km of the reservoir are also affected in a number of ways, directly&#13;
or indirectly.&#13;
33.   In the downstream command areas, the project will affect tribals directly by land acquisition&#13;
for canal construction, for which tribals are compensated according to the R&amp;R policy. In one sub-&#13;
project, Haribhangi, tribals are also affected by major land acquisition for the conveyance system (canal&#13;
and tunnel) from the reservoir to the command area over a distance of 8 km. Depending on the land&#13;
tenure situation, tribal cultivators within the irrigated command areas are assumed to benefit from&#13;
irrigation facilities on terms equal to those of non-tribals. However, some changes in access or&#13;
ownership to land coming under irrigation, in favour of non-tribals, may occur. This will be monitored&#13;
closely by the IPDP project (see below).&#13;
Objectives of the IPDP&#13;
34.   The overall objective of the IPDP is to secure development opportunities, and means and&#13;
mechanisms to access such opporaunities, for the WRCP affected tribal population taking into account&#13;
their particular vulnerable and marginalized status. The IPDP does not only mitigate negative effects&#13;
of infrastructure works (reservoirs and canals) resulting in submergence and loss of tribal peoples land&#13;
and assets. Project affected tribal people therefore include: (i) all tribal people negatively affected by&#13;
the loss of natural resources (land, forests) andlor community assets essential to the well being of that&#13;
community; (ii) all tribal people living within or adjacent to the irrigated command areas who will be&#13;
directly or indirectly affected (positively or negatively).&#13;
35    The specific objectives include:&#13;
(a)   implementation of mitigation activities (community assets/infrastructure) in&#13;
response to negative effects of the OWRCP;&#13;
(b)   implementation of community development activities which will support and&#13;
strengthen the economic and social status of tribals, their access and control over&#13;
their natural resources, and improve the productivity of tribal agricultural land and&#13;
forests in a sustainable manner;&#13;
(c)    empower tribals through capacity building of existing tribal institutions, tribal&#13;
women's group and tribal leadership.&#13;
Lmplementation Strategy for the IPDP&#13;
36.    The target group for implementation of the IPDP will be tribal communities defined as&#13;
independent villages or hamlets (habitations), and tribal neighbourhoods (sahi) within larger rmixed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 211 -&#13;
Annex 1 1&#13;
Page 10 of 18&#13;
community/caste villages. In all-tribal villages the target group will be the community as a whole. In&#13;
the case of mnixed villages, the strategy will have a poverty focus benefitting all the weaker&#13;
communities (e.g. also SCs). Infrastructural improvements, such as schools and public health facilities,&#13;
will be designed and planned for accordingly. However, activities will address the particular&#13;
vulnerable situation of tribals; e.g. land rights, literacy, health care, capacity building and&#13;
empowerment. Such activities will be given priority and safeguarded through the innovative NGO&#13;
approach of the IPDP.&#13;
37.   NGOs will have a key role in the IPDP project as intermediaries between tribals and&#13;
government. NGO presence is considered the most important prerequisite for successful planning,&#13;
implementation and turnover of project assets, activities and results to tribals own management&#13;
towards the end of the five year project period. The choice of involving NGOs and giving them a&#13;
central role in IPDP implementation is generally justified as a supplement to govemment efforts which&#13;
may not always have the capacity to reach all tribal communities in an area. NGOs will be the&#13;
project's direct link with the tribal communities to facilitate their active participation in implementation&#13;
and to support capacity building and empowerment of tribals.&#13;
38.   There are many positive experiences with NGOs supplementing government's development&#13;
efforts. A recent case in point is NGO involvement in the R&amp;R component of the OWRCP in&#13;
Harabhangi and Badanalla reservoir areas. In the two reservoir areas, local NGOs with the right&#13;
credibility and commitment are building up a relationship of trust and cooperation with tribal&#13;
communities. This will form the basis for assistance to R&amp;R based on respect for the needs and&#13;
concems expressed by tribals themselves. These experiences are of immediate relevance for the NGO&#13;
approach of the IPDP. In these particular areas the strategy will be to also involve the same NGOs in&#13;
the implementation of the [PDP.&#13;
39.   Obtaining legal rights to land and forests traditionally used by tribals (based on customary&#13;
rights) is another important element in the [PDP strategy. The project will build on experiences from&#13;
the IFAD supported Orissa Tribal Development Project in Rayagada District where unsurveyed land is&#13;
being surveyed and settled in favour of tribals. This is done in accordance with a 1990 Govenmment&#13;
Circular issued by the Revenue Department allowing for individual ryoti rights to land up to a 30&#13;
degree slope (in a catchment), and usufructuary rights to land/forests beyond that point. A local NGO&#13;
has been involved in organizing tribals and assisting them through the procedures of obtaining the land&#13;
rights. The NGO is also working in the R&amp;R component in the Badanalla sub-project of the OWRCP.&#13;
This and other NGOs will be involved in the implementation of the IPDP. The same "legal rights to&#13;
land" strategy will be followed to secure the rights of tribals to their ancestral habitat and to stabilize&#13;
the eco-system through appropriate cropping and agro-forestry practises. If successful on a large scale,&#13;
this activity will form an important milestone in tribal empowerment and development in the project&#13;
areas.&#13;
40.   The strategy will also emphasize continuous training and capacity building, not only for tribal&#13;
community leaders and tribals women's groups, but also for Panchayat members, local voluntary&#13;
organizations, and government departments involved in IPDP implementation. NGOs will guarantee&#13;
that the process of identifying and planning specific activities and community projects is participatory&#13;
and consultative.&#13;

Institutional Arrangements for Implementation of IPDP&#13;
41.   The major stakeholders in the projects are: Government of Orissa; tribal communities in the&#13;
sub-projects; and NGOs. Each has a key role to play in the project implementation. An overview of&#13;
institutional arrangements is presented in Table 2. The R&amp;R Directorate of DOWR will be overall&#13;
responsible for the project, release of funds, and for coordination at the state level. For proper&#13;
coordination and monitoring, a Special Officer IPDP (preferably with a social science background and&#13;
field experience in tribal development) will be posted in the R&amp;R Directorate. The thrust of project&#13;
activities will be in the sub-project areas, from village to district level. In the Scheduled Areas&#13;
(Badanalla, Haribhangi, Upper Jonk, Harihajore), the project will be implemented at district level as a&#13;
Special (Micro) Project under the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) of the Welfare&#13;
Department and chaired by the District Collector. As a Special Project under the ITDA, the project&#13;
will have its own separate budget and accounts which will appear within the overall district ITDP&#13;
budget and the overall district development budget, all of which is under the responsibility of the&#13;
District Collector.&#13;
42.   A Special Officer IPDP (Senior Class II Gazetted) will be posted (from the Tribal Welfare&#13;
Department) in each of the four sub-projects in Scheduled Areas to be directly responsible for IPDP&#13;
execution and flow of funds to the implementing government agencies at block level and to NGOs.&#13;
Following regular government procedures for Special Projects under 1TDA (GOO resolution of&#13;
November 14th, 1975) with appropriate modification, a Project Level Committee will be established&#13;
at each district level for: (i) approval of annual IPDP plans and budgets; and (ii) periodical reviews.&#13;
The committee will be chaired by the District Collector The Special Officer IPDP will be Member-&#13;
Secretary-cum-Convenor. S/he will assist the committee in review of the project implementation by&#13;
providing the necessary monitoring information. The composition of the committee is shown in Table 2&#13;
below. In the two sub-projects outside Scheduled Areas and ITDA (Rengali and Baghua), the IPDP&#13;
will be implemented as a Special Project under the direct responsibility and supervisiton of the District&#13;
Collector. All other implementation arrangements, including Project Level Committee and NGO&#13;
involvement, will be similar to the sub-projects under ITDA.&#13;
43.   Approval of annual plan and budget. Each annual activity plan and budget at district level will&#13;
be prepared following a bottom-up process of participatory planning through village committees.&#13;
NGOs will play an important facilitating role, and relevant officers at block level will also be consulted&#13;
in the process. The Special Officer IPDP, in coordination with NGOs and concemed BDOs, will be&#13;
responsible for consolidation of village plans into an annual sub-project/district activity plan and&#13;
budget. The Project Level Committee will then approve the annual plan and budget, and forward it to&#13;
the R&amp;R Directorate for approval.&#13;
44.   Flow of funds. The R&amp;R Directorate will release funds to the sub-projects biannually&#13;
according to the approved annual budget for each district/sub-project. Funds will be transferred by&#13;
cheque or bank draft to the concerned Special Project IPDP in the ITDA at district level. The Special&#13;
Officer lPDP will then arrange for transfer of funds to the executing departments at block level,&#13;
primarily for infrastructure projects (community assets). Funds will also be transferred directly to the&#13;
NGO operating in each sub-project, primarily for activities like: capacity building; mobilization;&#13;
liaison; and innovative community based activities.&#13;

45.   NGOs will preferably come from the sub-project areas, or at least from the neighbouring&#13;
districts. In case a suitable NGO cannot be identified, a state-level NGO with experience in tribal&#13;
affairs or other rural development experience will be considered. NGOs will be selected by the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate in consultation with the District Collector. NGOs will sign an agreement with the&#13;
concemed District Collector or the R&amp;R Directorate based on TOR to be finalized by the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate. NGOs will submit accounts of funds utilized to the ITDA/District Collector through the&#13;
Special Officer IPDP.&#13;

Activities under the IPDP&#13;
46.   IPDP activities will cover the following activity categories: community assets (infrastructure);&#13;
productive and innovative community activities; training and capacity building; legal rights to land;&#13;
and water user associations. A preliminary identification of activities has been made as part of the&#13;
study for preparation of the IPDP. During the five year project period, new activities will be identified&#13;
and planned for prior to each fiscal year. The planning process will be village based, by the village&#13;
commnittees and facilitated by NGOs and be deliberately adaptive in nature to incorporate lessons of&#13;
experience and results of monitoring.&#13;
47.    Criteria for prioritization. The selection of community projects and activities will be based on&#13;
prioritization according to the following basic criteria:&#13;
(a)    mitigation activities and assets will be given priority over all other activities;&#13;
(b)    degree of community motivation and initiative;&#13;
(c)    degree of community contribution through labour or in kind;&#13;
(d)    degree to which the activity will improve tribals access to, control over and&#13;
sustainable use of natural resources;&#13;
(e)    degree to which the activity will positively address women's heavy work load;&#13;
(f)    poverty situation in the village;&#13;
(g)   level and kind of basic needs to be met (e.g. health, food security, literacy).&#13;
The R&amp;R Directorate will be responsible for further operationalization and field testing of these&#13;
criteria, including preparation of detailed guidelines for inclusion of the criteria as a part of PRA. Prior&#13;
to their application in village level planning, NGOs and relevant block level officers/extension workers&#13;
will be trained in how to use the criteria during PRA.&#13;
48.   Community assets include the following physical infrastructure: school, community centre, link&#13;
road, pathway, culvert, tubewell, dug well, check dams, lift irrigation, public health centers/dispensary,&#13;
market place (haat), temple. Community assets have been identified according to the outcome of the&#13;
prelirninary PRA undertaken by consultants as part of the background study for the IPDP. The final&#13;
decision on which assets to imnplement will be determined through the baseline survey, PRA and village&#13;
level planning (refer steps 4 and 5 above). Implementation will involve the relevant government line&#13;
departments represented at Block level. Flow of funds will go to the concemed departments from the&#13;
District Collector through the Special IPDP Officer. There will be NGO involvement and community&#13;
participation (through the established Village Committees) in all stages of implementation: site&#13;
selection, design, civil works/labour contribution.&#13;
49.    Communitv activities include: agro-forestry and mixed plantations/cropping on hilly slopes,&#13;
small check damns (munda), soil conservation, restoration of grazing land, cooperative marketing (e.g.&#13;
milk), village grain banks, fisheries, functional literacy and legalAand training, women's societies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 216 -&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
preventive health care. Planning and implementation of these activities will to a larger extent depend on&#13;
NGO and village initiatives, less on inputs from govermment departments. Relevant govemrnment&#13;
departments include forestry, soil conservation, horticulture, cooperatives. Their involvement will be&#13;
in the form of extension service and technical advise. In most cases, flow of funds will go to the NGOs&#13;
from the District Collector through the Special IPDP Officer.&#13;
50.   Training/skills development and capacitv building of tribal communities will primarily be the&#13;
responsibilities of NGOs who will invite technical expertise for special skills development (e.g. agro-&#13;
forestry, literacy, health) from either govermment departments or extemal sources on a case by case&#13;
basis. The objective of these activities is three-fold: (i) to develop technical skills for new productive&#13;
sectors or niches; (ii) to enhance existing production systems and sustain tribals use of natural&#13;
resources; and (iii) to raise awareness and develop organizational capacity and strength&#13;
(empowerment) at the tribal community level, both for leadership, all-village and women's groups.&#13;
51.   Legal rights to land and forests traditionally used by tribal communities (based on customary&#13;
rights). NGOs together with Village Committees will proceed with securing legal rights to land within&#13;
a defined 30 degree slope in a catchment (rvot rights based on individual titles to land), and&#13;
usufructuary rights to land beyond the 30 degree slope. The procedure already applied by an NGO in&#13;
Rayagada District (AGRAGAMEE) in the IFAD supported Orissa Tribal Development Project&#13;
(OTDP) will be followed. In this connection, also the OTDP approach to ecologically sustainable land&#13;
use, also called Sustainable Agricultural Land Technology (SALT), will be followed as a joint effort of&#13;
NGOs and the Agricultural Extension and Forest Departments. This rather time consuming activity&#13;
will be ongoing during and beyond the project period. Its success rests on the NGO initiative, degree&#13;
of tribal awareness and empowerment, and support by key officials like the District Collector.&#13;
52.   Water User Associations (WUAs) will be formed among tribals in the command areas who&#13;
will be the beneficiaries of the project's irrigation facilities. NGOs and field level engineers of the&#13;
DOWR will be responsible for this activity. Timing will depend on the completion schedule for the&#13;
canal and distribution network in each sub-project. There will be close coordination and joint planning&#13;
with the FOT component of the project prior to and during the activities for establishment of WUAs&#13;
and subsequent turnover of minor irrigation systems to tribal farmers. IPDP Activities are defined as&#13;
mitigation activities (those in response to negative project effects), and activities supporting&#13;
development of tribal communities, indirectly or marginally affected, or not benefitting from the&#13;
project's irrigation facilities. In cases where it is not possible to form all-tribal WUAs, special care will&#13;
be taken to ensure tribal representation in the WUA committee.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
53.   The IPDP period will be five years. This period will allow for the implementation of mitigating&#13;
and community development activities based on tribal participation at all stages. It is assumed that&#13;
assets and other community support activities will be taken over by the communities themselves for&#13;
management, maintenance and continuation.&#13;
54.   The IPDP implementation schedule envisages the following steps/sequence of activities:&#13;
mobilization; training and capacity building; identification of community activities and projects;&#13;
planning; implementation; monitoring and follow-up; turnover to community management. Some of&#13;
these steps will overlap in their timing, some will be repeated during the life-time of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
Implementation will start with the beginning of fiscal year 1996-97. The implementation schedule to&#13;
be followed by each sub-project (with some sub-project specific variations) is presented below. A bar&#13;
chart showing the timing of activities over the five year project period is presented in Attachment 1.&#13;
Step 1. Mobilization (3 months)&#13;
-     Identification and contracting of NGOs&#13;
-     Constitution of IPDP Committees at District and State level.&#13;
-     Posting of Special IPDP Officers in four sub-projects (under ITDA), and one in the R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate.&#13;
Step 2. Training and Capacity Building (3-6 months, repeated at intervals)&#13;
-     NGOs&#13;
Special LPDP Officers (one in the R&amp;R Directorate, four in sub-projects).&#13;
-     IPDP Project Committees&#13;
-     Government agency staff involved&#13;
Step 3. Orientation and Local Public Consultation (3-6 months, repeated at&#13;
intervals)&#13;
-     Meetings at Panchayat, Block and District Level&#13;
-     Publications by R&amp;R Directorate and each sub-project&#13;
-     Information dissemination in tribal villages&#13;
Step 4. Baseline survey and PRA at Village Level (3-6 months)&#13;
-     Information/data collection for baseline survey&#13;
-     Identification of village leadership and community workers&#13;
-     Identification of community activities and projects through PRA&#13;
-     Establishment of Village Comnittees&#13;
Step 5. Village Level Planning (3 months, repeated annually)&#13;
-     Identification of new community projects and activities (based on criteria for prioritization).&#13;
-     Preparation of draft annual plan for each village by NGOs in consultation with Special Officer&#13;
IPDP and relevant officers at block level.&#13;
-     NGO consultation with each village on annual plan&#13;
Step 6. Annual Activity Plan and Budget (3 months, repeated annually)&#13;
-     For each District/sub-project&#13;
NGOs and Special IPDP Officer will jointly prepare annual plan and budget in consultation&#13;
with block level officers.&#13;
Plan approval by Special Project Committee/District Collector&#13;
&#13;

- 218 -&#13;
Annex  11&#13;
Page 17 of 18&#13;
Step 7. Village Level Implementation (ongoing for the project period)&#13;
Community assets (infrastructure): implementation of community assets will take place&#13;
over one fiscal year according to plan and budget. The majority of community assets will be&#13;
implemented over the first 3 years of the project.&#13;
Some communitv activities will be implemented over one fiscal year, others will be&#13;
ongoing through the entire five year project period. Activities in support of tribal legal rights to&#13;
land will be ongoing during the project period. Support to water user associations (WUAs)&#13;
will take place after completion of irrigation schemes and will take place in close coordination&#13;
with the FOT component of OWRCP.&#13;
Step 8. Monitoring and follow-up (quarterly)&#13;
Monitoring will be carried out as follows:&#13;
Ongoing: by Village IPDP Committee, reporting to NGOs&#13;
Quarterly: by NGOs, reporting to District Collector and R&amp;R Directorate&#13;
Quarterly: by the Special IPDP Officer, reporting to the District Collector and R&amp;R&#13;
Directorate.&#13;
Through regular procedure: by BDO/lTDA/departments&#13;
Step 9. Turnover to community management (after year 2-3, then ongoing)&#13;
When community assets are completed, they will be handed over to the village&#13;
community for maintenance and management (e.g. community centres, link roads,&#13;
tubewells, dug wells, check dams, lift irrigation schemes). Although there are departmental&#13;
responsibilities for maintenance of major assets like schools and PHCs, community&#13;
involvement in maintenance will also be promoted. Similarly, assistance to community&#13;
activities like plantations, agro forestry, WUAs and horticulture will be phased out once the&#13;
technical and management expertise has developed in the community. At the outset (planning&#13;
stage) of each activity, the NGO and the village community will agree on a tentative time for&#13;
turnover of assets/activities to community management.&#13;
Step 10. Monitoring and Evaluation (year 2 and 4)&#13;
(refer paras. 55-57 below)&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
55.   The physical progress and expenditures of IPDP will be monitored by the Special IPDP&#13;
Officer who will report to the Project Level Committee. Each annual Sub-Project or District plan and&#13;
budget will form the baseline against which progress will be monitored. Both NGOs and the Special&#13;
Project Officer will submit quarterly reports to the District Collector and the R&amp;R Directorate&#13;
according to a format to be developed by the R&amp;R Directorate. Indicators for monitoring by NGOs&#13;
and Special IPDP Officer are included in Attachment 2. Monitoring reports will also be made&#13;
available to the IPDP Sub-Committee at state level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 219 -&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 18 of 18&#13;
56.   A third party evaluation of the IPDP project will be carried out in year two and four of the&#13;
project. An ex-post evaluation, also by a third party, will be carried out one to two years after project&#13;
completion. Both the Tribal and Harijan Research and Training Institute as well as independent will be&#13;
considered for the evaluations. Both evaluations will look at the immediate effects and longer term&#13;
impacts of the IPDP project. The baseline information and PRA documentation produced by NGOs&#13;
will be used for the evaluation (refer Activity 4 above). TOR for the evaluations will be based on the&#13;
major indicators presented in Attachment 3.&#13;
57.   The Bank will supervise the implementation of the IPDP according to the general supervision&#13;
schedule of the OWRCP. The Bank will approve the TOR and selection of consultants for the third&#13;
party evaluations, scheduled for year 2 and 4.&#13;
Budget&#13;
58.   The total budget for the five years period is Rs. 38 million (US$ 1.2 million). A summary&#13;
budget and detailed budgets for each subproject is presented in Attachment 4.&#13;
59.   The first year's budget mainly covers mobilization and establishment, training, NGOs contract&#13;
and consultancies, baseline survey and planning. Year 2 and 3 will be the peak activity years in terms&#13;
of initiating new activities to be financed by the [PDP Tribal Development Fund (TDF). The TDF&#13;
budget for community assets and community activities over year 2 and 3 has been calculated based on&#13;
mitigation and other activities identified during the PRA applied by the consultants assisting in the&#13;
preparation of the IPDP. Year 4 and 5 will see a gradual reduction of the TDF budget (i.e. 60% and&#13;
40% of the TDF budget in year 2 and 3) as less activities are initiated and many are phased out and&#13;
turned over to the communities.&#13;
Financing.&#13;
60.   IDA financing of the IPDP would be as indicated in Chapter 3 of the Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
(SAR). Physical infrastructure (community assets, mixed plantations, and gochar land development)&#13;
would be elegible for reimbursement at 90%. Consultancies, training, NGO contracts and skill&#13;
development training would be elegible for 100% reimbursement. Office establishment would be&#13;
funded on a declining scale as for the R&amp;R costs in this category (refer SAR).&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
61.   GOO accounting and auditing procedures for ITDA will be followed at district and block level.&#13;
As a Special Project under ITDA, the IPDP project will have its own separate budget and accounts in&#13;
each district under the sub-projects. NGOs will have their own administration and implementation&#13;
budget. They will submit bi-annual accounts to the District Collector through the Special Officer IPDP.&#13;
The Special Officer IPDP will then be responsible for merging NGO accounts and accounts submitted&#13;
by involved departments into the consolidated Special Project accounts in each district/sub-project. In&#13;
addition, independent auditors acceptable to the Bank by the R&amp;R Directorate or District Collectors to&#13;
audit the NGO accounts.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Sectoral Environmental Assessment &amp; Environmental Action Plan&#13;
1.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
The proposed Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (OWRCP) is intended to upgrade&#13;
the capabilities, management and efficiency of the Department of Water Resources through&#13;
institutional strengthening, rehabilitation and modernization of existing schemes, as well as&#13;
completion of ongoing viable projects. During preparation of the OWRCP, a Sectoral&#13;
Environment Assessment (SEA) was carried out in accordance with World Bank guidelines.&#13;
Orissa's SEA report is essentially a baseline status document covering the environmental situation&#13;
in Orissa, Initial Environmental Examination of environmental impacts arising out of the&#13;
implementation of the proposed OWRCP activities and an Environmental Action Plan to be&#13;
funded under the OWRCP program, in order to integrate environmental concerns into water&#13;
resources management. As part of the Environmental Action Plan two EA cells will be formed&#13;
within the Water Planning (OWPO) and Project Preparation and Formulation (CE-PF) Units of&#13;
the Department of Water Resources (DOWR). These two EA cells will be supported by an&#13;
extensive training and technical assistance program. Supplementary EA and management work&#13;
will be executed under the OWRCP, as part of the Environmental Action Plan and in the form of&#13;
an on-the-job training program for the staff of the two EA cells and will be executed by&#13;
internationally renown foreign and local consultants. The details of the Environmental Action&#13;
Plan (EAP) are presented below.&#13;
The SEA was initially carried out by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) of&#13;
Australia, a consultant firm contracted by DOWR. The final report was prepared jointly by&#13;
DOWR Staff and SMEC consultants after making a detailed and exhaustive review of the issues&#13;
related to implementation of the OWRCP Program.&#13;
Though resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) issues are often considered to be an integral part of&#13;
Environmental Assessment, the World Bank has commissioned a separate evaluation of the R&amp;R&#13;
aspects and prepared an exclusive document within the frame work of the OWRCP. The social&#13;
impact analysis and economic rehabilitation of the project affected persons has been carried out&#13;
with the assistance of the operation Research Group and is described in Part II of this summary.&#13;
Assistance and guidance provided by the World Bank officials and officials of various&#13;
Departments of the Government of Orissa and different statutory bodies is gratefully&#13;
acknowledged.&#13;
2.    PART I - ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT &amp; ACTIONS&#13;
The Sectoral Environmental Assessment report reviews the environmental situation in Orissa&#13;
related to various key resources and particularly to the water resources sector of the state. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 234 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 21&#13;
includes a review of the existing policies, legal and environmental legislation affecting various&#13;
developmental activities related to the water resources sector of the state. An Initial&#13;
Environmental Examination of environmental impacts of OWRCP investments under various&#13;
sub-projects was undertaken to asses the overall environmental impacts on the water resource&#13;
sector. Where supplementary EA work is needed, it will be executed in agreement with World&#13;
Bank Policies. Necessary institutional strengthening and upgrading of environmental capabilities,&#13;
including training, technical assistance and liaison with other agencies, were also reviewed.&#13;
An Environmental Action Plan (EAP) has been prepared. The key component of this EAP is the&#13;
establishment of two environmental cells within the DOWR, which will be responsible for&#13;
handling the environmental aspects of the present and future water resources development&#13;
projects. The environmental issues related to the implementation of the OWRCP program were&#13;
reviewed and presented in an SEA report. The SEA report was compiled according to the&#13;
following broad framework and documented under the following sections:&#13;
I.    Environmental Policy, Legal &amp; Guidelines;&#13;
2.    Project Objectives &amp; Outline of the Orissa WRCP;&#13;
3.    Environmental Overview;&#13;
4.    Environmental Status and Impacts of OWRCP Sub-Projects;&#13;
5.    Environmental Capabilities; and,&#13;
6.    Environmental Action Plan.&#13;
This Executive Summary presents the synthesis of main points covered under the Sectoral&#13;
Environment Assessment report prepared exclusively for the OWRCP.&#13;
3.    ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LEGAL &amp; GUIDELINES&#13;
In this section review of policies and legislative Acts both at the Central and State Government&#13;
level have been made concerning environmental issues and its likely impacts on developmental&#13;
activities. The important acts are: Environment protection Act - 1986 and its recent notification&#13;
of Jan '94, in which various aspects of environmental issues, procedures and guidelines for&#13;
obtaining Environmental clearance have been outlined; the other important Act being the Forest&#13;
Conservation Act - 1980 and its amendments in 1988, which has important bearing in the&#13;
execution of projects; and, the National conservation Strategy and the statement on Environment&#13;
and Development Policy issued in 1992 gives a broad outline with respect to the Environment&#13;
Policy of the country. Besides these Acts, the National Water Policy issued in September 1987&#13;
has also laid emphasis on Environmental and Ecological conservation. In the State Water Policy,&#13;
recently issued by the Government of Orissa, necessary provision has been made towards&#13;
Environmental Management for sustainable development in the water resource sector of the state.&#13;
4.  ENVIRONMENTAL OVERVIEW&#13;
The OWRCP project covers command areas throughout the state of Orissa and basin planning&#13;
covers the surface waters of the entire state. An extensive study regarding environmental issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 235 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 3 of 21&#13;
of water related and its allied matters was made and information was collected from various&#13;
Government and NGO organizations. There was a need to prepare base line data for all&#13;
environmental issues connected with the development of the water resources sector of the state.&#13;
These base line data are briefly summarized below.&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
4.1    Climate &amp; Precipitation&#13;
Orissa is one of the richest states in terms of its natural resources. The climate of Orissa is of&#13;
tropical nature with the presence of a high humidity in the coastal areas. The average annual&#13;
rainfall of Orissa is 1,480 mm with 80% of its rainfall occurring from June to October. The&#13;
rainfall is caused by the monsoon and variation in precipitation is significant, both spatially and&#13;
temporally. The wide variation in precipitation results in drought and flood, shattering the&#13;
economic backbone of state.&#13;
4.2    Water Resources&#13;
There are eleven river basins in Orissa. The major rivers are the Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani,&#13;
Subaranerekha, Bhudhabalang, Indravati, Rushikulya and others. Orissa is fortunate to have&#13;
abundant water resources and is estimated to possess 7.81 M.ham of freshwater, which is 11.3 %&#13;
of the total water resource of India. Orissa's land area is 4.7% of the total land area of India.&#13;
Orissa has a population of 31.7 million which is 3.7% of the total population of India. As such&#13;
Orissa has plenty of water resources, which could be developed in an environmentally sustainable&#13;
manner for the development of the state. Orissa has so far developed 30% of its water resources.&#13;
4.3    Land Use&#13;
Out of total geographical area of 156,000 sq.km, 65,000 sq.km are cultivable, of which 90%, i.e.&#13;
59,000 sq.km, can be brought under irrigation. This is possible, because of the availability of&#13;
large water reserves in the state during the monsoon period. Despite the availability of large&#13;
quantities of water during the monsoon period, Orissa's irrigation coverage was only 21,200&#13;
sq.km in 1993, which is 36% of irrigable area, as compared to 71% coverage at National Level.&#13;
4.4   Irrigation &amp; Agriculture&#13;
Orissa is predominantly an agro-economic based state, of which 86% of its 31.7 million people&#13;
live in the rural area. The people of Orissa mainly depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The&#13;
soils and climate of Orissa are conducive for favorable crop growth. The rural work force is&#13;
agricultural oriented as cultivators and agricultural laborers constitute nearly 73% of the main&#13;
work force of the state. Out of 5.9 million ha of irrigable areas of the state, only 1.2 M ha have&#13;
been brought under irrigation. The maximum paddy production is recorded as 6.7 million ton in&#13;
91-92, which is much below the yield criteria for developed states. Rice is the main crop grown&#13;
in irrigated areas of the state.&#13;

4.5.   Socio-Economic Status&#13;
In spite of all favorable conditions, Orissa is considered as the poorest state of India, as 44.7% of&#13;
its population, the highest in India, lives below the poverty line according to the 1987-88 index, as&#13;
reported by the expert group appointed by the Planning Commission. Nothing has changed much&#13;
in the economic scenario since 1988. Orissa continues to remain under-privileged and&#13;
under-developed. The irrigation coverage remains much below the desired level and the yield per&#13;
ha is about half the yield obtained in Punjab or Haryana.&#13;
4.6.   Forest Coverage&#13;
Orissa's forest coverage of 57,187 sq.km stands as 36% of total geographical area of the state and&#13;
is endowed with rich treasures of Flora and Fauna. There is pressure on forest lands due to rapid&#13;
urbanization, population explosion, and other factors. However, the Forest Conservation Act has&#13;
helped to check the rate of deforestation and compensatory afforestation is being implemented for&#13;
all loss of forest on account of developmental activities.&#13;
4.7    Eco-Sensitive Areas&#13;
There are endangered species of Flora &amp; Fauna and the eco-sensitive areas like Similipal,&#13;
Mahendragiri, Gandhamardan hills. Bhitar Kanika, Satakosia Gorge etc., are specially protected&#13;
from the influence of developmental activity. Chilika lake, the biggest inland lake of the country,&#13;
has been recognized for its biodiversity value at the International Convention held at Ramsar&#13;
(Iran) in 1971, under auspices of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural&#13;
Resources. The Chilika lake needs protection to maintain its ecological balance for the&#13;
conservation of the high biodiversity value. The lake also needs environmental management for&#13;
maintenance of the salinity gradient and the reduction of sediment inflow in order to preserve the&#13;
socio-economic balance. This is necessary to be able to sustain the large population living on its&#13;
shores, which are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. There are two national parks and&#13;
fourteen sanctuaries in Orissa. Complex wetlands and aquatic ecosystems have developed in&#13;
Chilika Lake and in the Bhitar Kanika estuary. These systems are at present degrading rapidly&#13;
and need urgently protection.&#13;
4.8    Aquatic Ecology&#13;
As Orissa is endowed with a large coastline, interwoven by a large number of river systems, a&#13;
substantial population depends on fisheries and pisciculture. A substantial potential exists in terms&#13;
of freshwater and brackish water fisheries in Orissa. However, considerable alteration to the&#13;
riverine aquatic ecology have been associated with water resources developments. Further water&#13;
diversion for irrigation needs careful investigation and planning. The aquatic ecology and fisheries&#13;
aspects are integral to water resources and river basin planning, which should be adequately&#13;
addressed in future planning of the water resources sector. Necessary assistance of the Central&#13;
Institute for Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) will be requested for improving the production of&#13;
aquacultural output, as well as to upgrade the knowledge and stimulate the integration of aquatic&#13;
ecology considerations in the development of the water resources sector.&#13;

4.9   Mineral Deposits&#13;
Orissa has rich mineral deposits of metallic &amp; non-metallic ore with distinction of the largest&#13;
producers of minerals, like chrome, manganese, dolomite, graphite and quartzite. Orissa has large&#13;
reserves of low-grade coal deposits, which stimulated the setting-up of a large number of thermal&#13;
power stations besides establishing iron and steel, alurninum and cement plants at a strategic&#13;
location.&#13;
4.10 Water Pollution&#13;
Due to above developments the Angul/Talcher and Rourkela mining and industrial zones of the&#13;
Brahmani Basin are already adversely affecting local water resources. The Angul/Talcher zone,&#13;
which is located in the central sector of the Brahmani Basin, is one of the worst 15 pollution&#13;
problem areas in India. The State Pollution Control Board is preparing an Action Plan to protect&#13;
this reach.&#13;
The water quality situation in certain parts of Orissa is becoming quite critical, particularly in view&#13;
of the large potential expansion in the mineral and industrial sectors. The adversely affected&#13;
polluted reaches being the upper and mid-Brahmani, lb River and the mid reaches of the&#13;
Mahanadi, the lower reaches of Rushikulya and other water bodies.&#13;
4.11 Waterlogging and salinity problems&#13;
The waterlogging and salinity problems in the irrigated delta of the coastal zones in Orissa&#13;
represent a substantial problem. Out of 300,000 ha CCA in the Mahanadi Delta about 85,000 ha&#13;
have been adversely affected by waterlogging and salinity.&#13;
In view of the large areas becoming unproductive, an holistic and integrated approach is required&#13;
for planning and management of all irrigated areas, including detailed assessments, conjunctive&#13;
use of surface and groundwater, and providing of drainage to mitigate waterlogging and salinity&#13;
problems.&#13;
5.    SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
The sectoral environment impact assessment covers the overview of the present status of the&#13;
water resources sector of the state and of future implications associated with developments&#13;
envisaged under the OWRCP. A review of project wise environmental assessments, which&#13;
identified positive and negative impacts, monitoring and mitigation needs, has been made. This&#13;
along with a review of the rehabilitation of existing irrigation projects and suggested&#13;
improvements, gives a detailed insight into the situation prevailing in the water resources sector of&#13;
the state.&#13;
The summary of such assessments are given below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
Page 6 of 21&#13;
Environmental Impacts of Project Investments&#13;
5.1    Environmental Impacts of SIFT Projects&#13;
One of the major concerns of the OWRCP is the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing&#13;
irrigation projects which are presently operating at a sub-optimal level. There has been disparity&#13;
in delivery systems with unwarranted supply to the head reaches and scarcity of water in the tail&#13;
ends, which resulted in chronic waterlogging and possibly salinization. The investments under the&#13;
OWRCP in this component will bring relief to 240,000 ha of irrigated command area. The overall&#13;
socio-economic and environmental benefits from the rehabilitation and improved O&amp;M outweigh&#13;
any potential adverse environmental effects. The dominant long term beneficial impacts&#13;
associated with the rehabilitation and improved O&amp;M of these sub-projects would be a reduction&#13;
in disparities and an improved rationalization of irrigation water supply with direct economic&#13;
benefits to water users and CCA communities. The reduction of over-irrigation in head reaches&#13;
will increase yields, while reliable water supply to the tail ends will increase yields substantially.&#13;
Because of improved water management waterlogging of the soil will reduce, soil salinity will&#13;
decrease, since the process of leaching of salts out of the top soil to deeper layers is accelerated&#13;
by increased supply of fresh irrigation water. The overall effect will be an increase in the&#13;
agricultural productivity of both rice and other irrigated crops, which will be overwhelmingly&#13;
beneficial for the farmer communities.&#13;
Improved water management will reduce the area of potential mosquito breeding habitats and will&#13;
likely reduce the transmission rates of malaria, elephantiasis and other waterborne diseases. The&#13;
health department will be responsible for monitoring the incidence of malaria and other&#13;
waterborne diseases. In case of increased incidence rates the Health Department will take&#13;
adequate curative and preventive actions to counter act the increase of malaria cases.&#13;
Increase in the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides due to development of irrigated agriculture&#13;
is expected to be at a modest level. The adverse effects due to contamination of groundwater are&#13;
not apprehended. It is recommended that over time Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods&#13;
for rice could be further developed and implemented in the project area. This reduces the&#13;
pesticide loading rates and makes the introduction of rice-cum-fish farming feasible in the paddy&#13;
fields, which further enhances the socio-economic situation of the farmers (less expenses for&#13;
pesticides and extra income and proteins from fish) and improves the nutritional status.&#13;
Although water quality in general is still good in Orissa, locally heavy water pollution occurs and&#13;
the trend is a deterioration in water quality. Therefore it is recommended to monitor water&#13;
quality in the irrigation water supply and drainage canals of each of the SIFT projects to obtain&#13;
information in relation to irrigation water quality and to safeguard public health interests. Special&#13;
attention has to be paid to heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals possibly discharged&#13;
upstream by industries and mines. The establishment of a water quality base-line is urgent. Water&#13;
quality data in the rabi (dry) season are most indicative, since pollutants are concentrated in this&#13;
period. Water quality monitoring in drainage canals should be used for salt balance calculations&#13;
and are indicative for status of salinization in the project areas.&#13;
The execution of these sub-projects under the OWRCP will be overall environmentally beneficial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
Page 7 of 21&#13;
5.2   Environmental Impacts of Scheme Completion Projects&#13;
The three medium scheme completions under the OWRCP are located in the southern and&#13;
western parts of Orissa. These potential projects have been subjected to an environmental&#13;
analysis. Impacts on flora and fauna, forest submergence, catchment treatment etc., were&#13;
investigated.&#13;
The completion of medium sized projects, in overall, will be environmentally beneficial, as the&#13;
production of foodgrains and the creation of employment opportunities will go a long way to&#13;
alleviate the suffering of rural the populations. In one of the medium projects, i.e. Upper Jonk&#13;
project some old archaeological monuments of Marauder Valley will be submerged in the&#13;
reservoir. In order to rehabilitate the monuments, as well as to preserve archaeological findings&#13;
a museum will be set up for which Rs. 1.0 million has been placed with the Department of&#13;
Tourism, Sports and Culture.&#13;
In case of the three major projects candidates identified under the OWRCP, the Rengali Irrigation&#13;
project, the Naraj Barrage and Mahanadi-Chitrotpala Island Irrigation project, the scope of work&#13;
for two projects relates to the development of the command area. The loss of forest in the&#13;
command area is marginal. The second project relates to replacement of century old Naraj&#13;
barrage. There will be no submergence or loss of forest, rather it will ensure flood control and&#13;
stabilize irrigation systems in the coastal districts of Puri and Cuttack of Orissa. The Naraj weir is&#13;
now showing signs of distress and having many failure indicators. This structure is more than a&#13;
centuries old and may give way at any point of time thereby may cause dislocation of 206,000 ha&#13;
of irrigation systems. The environrmental impacts of the Naraj Barrage are dealt with in more&#13;
detail below.&#13;
The establishment of irrigation command areas for the above projects will form a marginal&#13;
potential health risk due to the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Necessary&#13;
preventive measure for control of malaria will be taken up by the Health Department. Any change&#13;
in incidence rates of malaria or other waterborne diseases has to be followed by curative and&#13;
preventive action from the side of the Health Department.&#13;
Also in these project areas it is recommended to start a water quality program in each of the&#13;
completion projects in order to guarantee a safe irrigation water supply. Water quality samples in&#13;
the rabi (dry) season are most important, since pollutants are more concentrated in this period.&#13;
Special attention should be paid to heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals, discharged by&#13;
upstream industries and mines. Water quality monitoring in drainage channels should be used for&#13;
salt balance calculations and are indicative for the status of salinization in the project areas.&#13;
The Rengali Irrigation project, will affect some forest land in the barrage area and in the canal&#13;
alignment. Adequate steps have already been taken or are in the process of negotiation for&#13;
creation of compensatory afforestation as required to be complied under statutory provision of the&#13;
Forest Conservation Act. The formation of a barrage for this project will displace around 2,450&#13;
persons, who are required to be resettled and rehabilitated as per policy of Government of Orissa.&#13;
The R&amp;R process is already well underway.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
Page 8 of 21&#13;
Naraj Barrage&#13;
The replacement of the Naraj weir is urgently needed. It will be replaced by a barrage with gates&#13;
for flow regulation. These gates will serve a triple purposes, i.e.:&#13;
(i) Increase the discharge in the Mahanadi arm;&#13;
(ii) Control the discharge in the Kuakhai river; and,&#13;
(iii) Manage intelligently the freshwater and sediment inflow into Lake Chilika, in&#13;
order to maintain the brackish water state of this unique Ramsar site and to&#13;
reduce salutation of the lake.&#13;
Positive impacts of the Naraj Barrage are:&#13;
(I)    Ensure irrigation water to 206,000 ha of fertile land in delta stage-I command area of the&#13;
Mahanadi Delta, which is otherwise vulnerable to disruption in any point of time;&#13;
(ii)   Providing flood protection and silt reduction loading to 160,000 ha in the delta stage II&#13;
area;&#13;
(iii)   Ensuring regulation of floods in the Kuakhai arm to its safe bank full capacity up to a&#13;
flood of 28,300 cumecs in the Mahanadi at Head of delta (i.e. Naraj);&#13;
(iv)   Providing a management tool for the management of Lake Chilika. Up to a flood of&#13;
28,300 cumecs at the Naraj Barrage, the freshwater and the sediment inflow into Lake&#13;
Chilika can be regulated. The operational rules of the Naraj Barrage have to be developed&#13;
in such a manner that intelligent operation of the Naraj Barrage will result into the&#13;
conservation of this unique ecosystem with respect to the salinity gradient and the&#13;
sediment loading rates. It should be noticed, that only around 50% of the freshwater&#13;
inflow into Lake Chilika comes from the Mahanadi River the rest originates from the small&#13;
rivers around the lake. Also the salinity gradient is further determined by the drainage cuts&#13;
directly to the sea and by the width and depth of the mouth of Lake Chilika to the sea;&#13;
(v)   In case the Naraj Weir is not replaced by the new Naraj Barrage and the old weir&#13;
collapses, there will be no irrigation water in Delta Stage I (most of the water will flow&#13;
through the Kathjori Branch) and there will be extensive long term flooding in the Delta&#13;
Stage II area and there will flow too much freshwater and sediment to Lake Chilika, which&#13;
will cause the breakdown of the Chilika Lake ecosystem; and,&#13;
(vi)  Providing an alternate communication link from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar the state capital&#13;
and reduce traffic congestion in the National Highway-5.&#13;
Negative Impacts of the Naraj Barrage are:&#13;
The Naraj Barrage itself has very limited, if any, adverse impacts. The adverse impacts&#13;
might arise for Lake Chilika, if the operational rules of the Naraj Barrage do not take into&#13;
account the freshwater needs (positive as well as negative needs) for Lake Chilika&#13;
(preliminary estimates indicate that Lake Chilika needs are approximately 1,400 million&#13;
m3/year of total freshwater inflow from the Mahanadi River to maintain the salinity&#13;
gradient, as indicated by the Chilika Development Authority; these figures should be&#13;
refined through a comprehensive monitoring program). An environmental study will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 241 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 9 of 21&#13;
commissioned, executed by an international renown consultant, for the development of the&#13;
operational rules of the Naraj Barrage in conjunction with the existing and planned&#13;
drainage cuts, in order to achieve the 3 objectives of the Naraj Barrage, as mentioned&#13;
above.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(i)    The freshwater needs of Lake Chilika have to be based on the results of a salinity gradient&#13;
monitoring scheme, which will be executed by the Chilika Development Authority&#13;
(monthly monitoring is already ongoing for two years). This salinity gradient monitoring&#13;
scheme forms part of an extensive monitoring scheme, which includes also sediment&#13;
monitoring by means of remote sensing imagery. The Chilika Development Authority&#13;
needs to be member of the Water Resources Board, where water allocations are discussed.&#13;
An excellent communication line is necessary between the DOWR and the Chilika&#13;
Development Authority in order to allocate the necessary quantity of freshwater for&#13;
Chilika Lake.&#13;
(ii)   Water quality monitoring in the Mahanadi River just upstream of the Naraj Barrage in&#13;
order to obtain information in relation to irrigation water quality and to determine&#13;
pollution loading rates for the irrigation schemes and for Lake Chilika from the Mahanadi&#13;
River. Special attention has to be paid to heavy metals and other possible hazardous&#13;
chemicals discharged upstream by industries and mines. This is a precaution, since water&#13;
quality in Orissa is in general still good, but in some river stretches heavy pollution occurs&#13;
by unchecked industrial discharges and mine tail waters.&#13;
(iii)   Necessary fish pass ladder in the structure to be provided for movement of aquatic&#13;
species.&#13;
(iv)   Survey of endangered aquatic species be taken up in Mahanadi River for preventing and&#13;
extinction of rare species. Migratory behavior and breeding cycle of aquatic fauna to be&#13;
studied.&#13;
(v)   To ensure adequate discharge downstream for following:&#13;
- Mangrove ecosystem;&#13;
- Aquatic flora fauna,&#13;
- Fisheries resources in the estuary and the nearby coastal inshore area; and,&#13;
- Salinity ingress.&#13;
All the five medium schemes and the three potential major schemes to be taken up under the&#13;
OWRCP will be environmentally beneficial, as assurance of food production and creation of&#13;
employment opportunities will outweigh any marginal adverse impacts.&#13;
5.3   Other Water Sector Related Issues&#13;
Some of the works which do not involve physical execution, but have significant bearing on the&#13;
development of the water resources sector, are also subjected to environmental impact&#13;
assessment, are presented below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 242 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 10 of 21&#13;
5.3.1 River Basin Multi-Sectoral Planning&#13;
The key issues involved in restructuring of DOWR is to create the Orissa Water Planning&#13;
Organization (OWPO) with primary objective to tackle multi-sectoral demands with integration of&#13;
environmental considerations.&#13;
The multi-sectoral approach to river basin planning with due considerations to environmental&#13;
requirements such as protection of ecologically sensitive areas and retention of adequate pollution&#13;
assimilative capacity would offer a basic frame work for integrated sustainable development&#13;
planning for all natural resources. The integration of environmental considerations at the early&#13;
planning stage will not only be helpful for allocation of water resources to multi-sectoral users,&#13;
but ensure conservation and water quality protection and will help in monitoring all sensitive&#13;
environmental issues by way of establishing an Environmental Management task force for each&#13;
river basin. As such the up-front EIA work done for the planning of river basins and consequent&#13;
multi-sectoral planning will increase the environmental sustainability considerably, as compared to&#13;
the present approach.&#13;
5.3.2 Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Most aspects of the institutional restructuring of DOWR attempt to improve the capabilities and&#13;
efficiencies of water resources planning and management. Substantial benefit would be obtained&#13;
by creation of a broad based administrative machinery for development of water resources and&#13;
integrating multi-disciplinary approaches to water resource planning. The most effective positive&#13;
contribution will be the establishment and operation of the two Environmental Assessment cells in&#13;
the River Basin Planning and Project Preparation and Formulation Directorates. This will build&#13;
up the in-house environmental assessment capabilities for the water sector for the present set-up&#13;
as well as for the future institutional set-up. The extensive training and technical assistance&#13;
components are meant to strengthen the two EA cells in DOWR.&#13;
5.3.3 Ground Water Development&#13;
The total groundwater potential is estimated at 1,700,400 ham (hectare meter). Out of which&#13;
annual utilization is limited to 143,914 ham, which less than 10% of the total potential available.&#13;
As a vast groundwater resource remains untapped the development of a groundwater master plan&#13;
is needed and its development has to be integrated with surface water utilization in the different&#13;
river basins of Orissa, so that the adverse impacts are avoided and water resources are rationally&#13;
and sustainably used.&#13;
5.3.4 Water Quality&#13;
The water quality situation in certain parts of Orissa is becoming very critical, particularly in the&#13;
Angul/Talcher region of the mid-Brahmani Basin. This reach has become extremely polluted due&#13;
to the concentration of large numbers of industries and calls for strategic planning to protect the&#13;
water quality in this reach of the river. A necessary action plan will be drawn up in consultation&#13;
with the State Pollution Control Board to protect this reach of the Brahmani Basin, as well as&#13;
other critical areas of the Mahanadi and Rushikulya Basins.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 243 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 11 of 21&#13;
It can be said, that in general the water quality in Orissa is still good, although the situation is&#13;
rapidly changing, as is indicated above.&#13;
5.3.5 Community Health&#13;
The growing incidence of malaria and other waterborne diseases among the rural mass is causing&#13;
worry in recent times. The rehabilitation and modernization of existing projects under SIFT&#13;
component of the OWRCP will go a long way in reduction of the above mentioned diseases, as&#13;
better water management will help to reduce the number of breeding habitats for mosquitoes.&#13;
Further necessary steps will be taken in consultation with health officials. A monitoring plan will&#13;
be drawn up to take monitor changes in incidence rates of malaria. If changes are observed&#13;
adequate preventive and curative measures for malaria control in the command areas of the&#13;
irrigation systems will be taken.&#13;
5.3.6 Other Environmental Issues&#13;
Besides above issues, the river basin planning efforts to be taken up under the OWRCP will&#13;
ensure an optimum use of water resources and integrate flood control and drought management.&#13;
The catchment treatment program to be drawn up in consultation with the Soil Conservation&#13;
Department will reduce silt inflow over time and protect the lifetime of the reservoirs in the state.&#13;
Further, the OWRCP will ensure adequate funding of canal maintenance and the operational&#13;
program of canal water supply will reduce the growth of aquatic weeds and ensure a better water&#13;
management in the command areas.&#13;
6.    ENVIRONMENTAL CAPABILITIES&#13;
The environmental expertise available amongst the various Government of Orissa Departments is&#13;
very limited. Only a few Departments and organizations, like the Department of Forest and&#13;
Environment, the State Pollution Control Board and the Orissa Remote Sensing Application&#13;
Center and some others, have acquired some knowledge and have developed a methodology for&#13;
environmental impact assessment, as they have been entrusted with routine environmental&#13;
assessment work of projects related to their discipline. Besides some departments, like DOWR,&#13;
Industries and Fisheries and others, have developed limited capabilities for processing their&#13;
projects, so as to comply with the statutory requirements, as enforced under the Environmental&#13;
Protection Act-1986, and the Forest Conservation Act-1980.&#13;
However with the commencement of the Sectoral EA study and the preparation of the Sectoral&#13;
Environmental Assessment report for the OWRCP, a genuine and positive interest of integration&#13;
of Environmental Management with Water Resource Development has developed, which will&#13;
ultimately enhance the capability of DOWR officials. The formation of two EA cells in the&#13;
DOWR, one under the Basin Planning Directorate and the other under the Project Preparation&#13;
and Formulation Directorate will build up the capabilities of DOWR officials, which is one of the&#13;
OWRCP's investment priorities for institutional restructuring and developing capabilities within&#13;
the DOWR.&#13;

7.    ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN&#13;
An Environmental Action Plan has been prepared covering a period of 7 years, i.e. from&#13;
1995-2002 for developing the environmental assessment and management capabilities within&#13;
DOWR. These environmental assessment capabilities will be utilized for the integration of&#13;
environmental aspects into the State Water Plan, and into the River Basin and Sub-Basin Plans, as&#13;
well as in the specific Project Formulation Plans. These capabilities will also develop awareness&#13;
amongst the officers of DOWR for efficiently managing water allocations amongst the cross&#13;
sectoral users with the objective of water conservation and the optimal use of water resources.&#13;
The development of the water resources of the state will be in conformity with the policy of the&#13;
Environmental Management Plan outlined in the State Water Policy.&#13;
7.1 Priority Environmental Action Plan Components&#13;
The overall priority of the Environmental Action Plan is the formation of the EA cells and the&#13;
training of the EA staff in DOWR, in order to integrate environmental concerns into the project&#13;
planning and river basin planning activities of DOWR, to achieve a more environmentally&#13;
sustainable development of water resources in Orissa.&#13;
The two EA cells will be formed by incremental staff financed on a declining basis through the&#13;
OWRCP (to increase sustainability after the OWRCP is finished), each consisting of 6&#13;
professional and 2 technical staff members. This incremental staff will be partly recruited from&#13;
within the DOWR, while special environmental, public health, water quality, forestry and other&#13;
specialized staff will be recruited from other departments in Orissa or from all ovtr India. All the&#13;
professionals will receive, during the seven years of the OWRCP, an intensive training in the fields&#13;
related to their functions. These training programs will be in foreign and local universities, in&#13;
local technical institutions (e.g. NEERI), in international seminars and conferences, special&#13;
training courses within the state in the WALMI.&#13;
The staff of two EA cells will receive an on-the-job training by renown international consultants&#13;
(30 man months), assisted by highly qualified Indian consultants (60 man months). These&#13;
consultants come only a few months per year, in the form of twinning arrangement, to provide&#13;
hands-on training. Both foreign (13 man months) and Indian(30 man months) consultants will be&#13;
experienced water resources EA experts. The on-the-job training will be partly provided by&#13;
elaborating real EA case studies, e.g. Upper Jonk, Harabhangi, Naraj Barrage and others.&#13;
The remaining 17 man months for foreign consultants and 30 man months for Indian consultants&#13;
will be filled by consultants with a specific expertise required in that period by the DOWR. The&#13;
Technical Assistance has been set up in such a flexible way that it caters maximally to the needs of&#13;
the DOWR EA cells.&#13;
The general functions and responsibilities of the two EA cells in the OWPO and the CE-PF are&#13;
indicated in Table 7.1. However, there are certain specific components, projects, case studies and&#13;
environmental data compilation tasks which should be designated as priority items. These have&#13;

been selected as they would provide key background data and appropriate experience for other&#13;
OWRCP projects and future EA work within the Department (e.g. inputs to river basin plans and&#13;
setting of project priorities).&#13;
7.2   State Water Policy&#13;
The State Water Policy was adopted by the Government of Orissa in April 1994. The State&#13;
Water Policy has lid a specific emphasis on the implementation of an Environmental&#13;
Management Plan. This plan includes identification of adverse impacts in the planning stage of a&#13;
project and take mitigating steps to obviate or avoid these adverse impacts. The Environmental&#13;
Management Plan will take steps for rehabilitation measures, afforestation, relocation of&#13;
historical/cultural monuments, taking into account the water and other needs of sanctuaries and of&#13;
wildlife habitats affected by the project, investigate downstream impacrs on estuarine and coastal&#13;
fisheries and on salt intrusion of water diversions for irrigation, implement as well as taking&#13;
remedial measures to mitigate the effects of waterlogging and salinization.&#13;
7.3   Institutional Strengthening&#13;
As a follow up action of the strengthening of the Department of Water Resources and the&#13;
establishment of two EA cells, the Government of Orissa created the Water Resources Board&#13;
(WRB) under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary of the state which will be the highest policy&#13;
making authority for framing a strategy for the development of the water resources of the state.&#13;
There is also need for a coordinated approach between the various water managers and users&#13;
departments to inter-act and integrate environmental considerations into different sectoral uses of&#13;
water resources. The WRB should meet once three months, even in absence of the chairman, to&#13;
discuss new issues and take decisions on pending ones. The water Resources Board constituted a&#13;
multi-disciplinary environmental subgroup with departments, like the Departments of Water&#13;
Resources, Agriculture, Energy, Industries, Urban Development, Rural Development, Planning &amp;&#13;
Coordination, and Forest and Environment Department, to which the Chilika Development&#13;
Authority belongs (the Chilika Development Authority should also be a member of the WRB), for&#13;
assisting the Water Resources Board for taking policy decisions on environmental matters&#13;
conforming to the environmental needs laid down in the National and State Water Policies. There&#13;
is strong need for a streamlined communication between the various organizations related to the&#13;
water sector and it is recommended that the WRB should authorize the Environmental Sub-group&#13;
to meet once in two months convened by the Chief Engineer for Water Planning, to prepare the&#13;
agenda, sort out problems and settle issues for development of sound environmental management&#13;
of the water sectors of the state. Development activities will fully integrate environmental and&#13;
sustainability aspects, so that the overall impacts will be environmentally beneficial.&#13;
As already mentioned, one of the key issue involved in the strategy of the "Environmental Action&#13;
Plan" is to set up two EA cells with the specific designated purpose to develop necessary&#13;
managerial capabilities. The two environmental cells will be formed in:&#13;
1. Basin Planning Directorate; and,&#13;
2. Project Preparation and Formulation Directorate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 246 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 14 of 21&#13;
They will have the following specific objectives:&#13;
1) Basin Planning Directorate EA cell:&#13;
a)    Setting up Environmental data base management system;&#13;
b)    Preparing EA guidelines conforming to Ministry of Environment Stipulation &amp;&#13;
other acts of state and central Government;&#13;
c)    Integration of EA Components in preparation of river basin plans;&#13;
d)    Preparation of water conservation management measures and multi-sectoral water&#13;
allocations for integration in the state water plans; and,&#13;
e)    Integrating NHP activities related to Environmental Assessment; and;&#13;
2) Project Preparation Formulation Directorate EA cell:&#13;
a)    Preparation of comprehensive baseline inventories of Environmental issues of all&#13;
completed projects for storage into the Environmental Database;&#13;
b)    Undertake detailed EA assessments of ten projects undertaken in the OWRCP,&#13;
c)    Monitor and implement Environmental Management Plans of OWRCP sub-&#13;
projects; and,&#13;
d)    Undertake required liaison with other state agencies, like the State Pollution&#13;
Control Board for the preservation of water quality. Execute water quality&#13;
analysis of the supply and drainage channels of individual projects, in order avoid&#13;
public health hazards caused by polluted irrigation water supplies. Pay special&#13;
attention to the measurement of heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals in&#13;
irrigation supply water. Salinity data from the drainage channels can be used for&#13;
the calculation of a salt balance of the area and are indicative for the degree of&#13;
salinization in the area.&#13;
7.4    Measurement and Monitoring Capability&#13;
The Orissa Water Planning Organization (OWPO) will monitor and measure all aspects of surface&#13;
water hydrology including water quality i.e. siltload, bedload, salinity, organic and inorganic&#13;
pollutants, including heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals. The National Hydrology&#13;
Project will set up central and field laboratories to monitor all aspects of water quality. The State&#13;
Data Center will develop computerized facilities for storage, retrieval and dissemination of all&#13;
relevant data for study and research purposes. The proposed OWPO will ensure the development&#13;
of a comprehensive state hydrological and water quality data base for surface and groundwater&#13;
and develop facilities for interaction with other state agencies. Euroconsult/Delft Hydraulics, the&#13;
consultants engaged for river basin planning are installing two water quality models, like Delwaq&#13;
(Water Quality) and WLM (Waste Load Model) for study and monitoring of the water quality&#13;
status of Orissa rivers.&#13;
Both EA cells in DOWR will have their own laboratory for their own investigations, for the&#13;
preparation of EA studies, to identify water quality problems in irrigation supply water and for&#13;
other purposes related to their functions.&#13;
&#13;

7.5   Ground Water Management&#13;
The ground water development agency, which is at present administratively under the Rural&#13;
Development Department will be brought ultimately under the control of the Department of&#13;
Water Resources, which will facilitate the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, since it is&#13;
under the same agency. The planning and management of all water resources by one agency will&#13;
avoid waterlogging as well as excessive withdrawal of groundwater. The utilization of the&#13;
groundwater potential is at present at a low level and only 10% of the available resources is&#13;
utilized. As such there is a need for a master plan for the development of groundwater resources,&#13;
which should integrate environmental concerns.&#13;
Since the level of groundwater utilization is still low, this is the right time to develop groundwater&#13;
legislation, including the issuing of licenses and water charges, for the sustainable use of&#13;
groundwater resources. If one waits with the development of groundwater legislation until the&#13;
time groundwater resources are extensively used, it will be difficult to implement this type of&#13;
legislation, since people are accustomed to the free use of the resource.&#13;
7.6   Catchment Management&#13;
Watershed management will form an integral part of environmental management in order to&#13;
control sediment inflow into the reservoirs. Instead of a project specific approach, a detailed&#13;
watershed management master plan will be prepared for each individual basin, in consultation with&#13;
the Soil Conservation and Forest Departments of the Government of Orissa. The EA cells formed&#13;
under the DOWR will be assigned with the task of preparing watershed management plans as part&#13;
of environmental studies for river basins. The directives issued by the Central Water Commission&#13;
in November 1993 for preparation of catchment treatment plans will be integrated in the above&#13;
management plan.&#13;
7.7   Consultancy Services &amp; Training&#13;
There are limited capabilities amongst DOWR officials to study and integrate environmental&#13;
issues in the state water plan. The two environmental cells to be constituted will be headed by&#13;
Engineers of DOWR, although environmental specialist staff will be recruited from other&#13;
departments in Orissa or from all over India. As such it is very much essential and desirable to&#13;
offer the necessary training facilities to engineers in the National Institutes of India and abroad.&#13;
As mentioned before, the OWRCP includes an extensive training program and a strong Technical&#13;
Assistance component, of local and foreign consultants, for technical advice and on-the-job&#13;
training. These consultants will guide the DOWR EA staff in the preparation of EA studies.&#13;
These local and foreign consultants, which will only come for a few months in a year, but for a&#13;
period of seven year (a kind of twinning arrangement) will be engaged to guide the engineers and&#13;
specialist staff in the development of master plans in which environmental issues related of water&#13;
resources development are integrated and tackled. The Water and Land Management Institute&#13;
(WALMI) of the Government of Orissa will play an active part in organizing seminars, workshops&#13;
as well as acts as consultants for training the state engineers in environmental issues.&#13;

7.8   Applied Research Program&#13;
Necessary basin development study has already been initiated under the OWRCP. Accordingly an&#13;
international repute consultant "Euroconsult/Delft Hydraulics" of the Netherlands has been&#13;
appointed to take up an in depth study of the development of the water resources of the state.&#13;
The consultant commenced their work by the first week of November 1994. The consultant in&#13;
their scope of work will take up studies for integration of environmental issues in the river basin&#13;
plans and will identify topics for carrying out research by the state engineers. Necessary research&#13;
program for above environmental studies will drawn up by WALMI under the OWRCP.&#13;
Innovative applied and problem solving research, under certain conditions, can be funded under&#13;
the OWRCP.&#13;
7.9   Funding&#13;
In the preliminary break up of investments under the OWRCP, a provision of around Rs. 58&#13;
million (including technical assistance) has been kept for funding of the environmental action plan.&#13;
The OWRCP will fund the entire Environmental Action Plan, including incremental and specialist&#13;
environmental staff, extensive training, and technical assistance, set-up of two laboratories and&#13;
equipment. In summary, the cost of the Environmental Action Plan for the DOWR in the 1995-&#13;
2002 period based on setting up and operating the two EA cells as outlined above are:&#13;
Program for River Basin Planning EA cell                US$ 485,097&#13;
Program for Project Planning and Formulation EA cell    US$ 484,516&#13;
Training and Technical Assistance                       US$ 898,467&#13;
Total for the OWRCP Environmental Action Plan           US$ 1,868,080&#13;
7.10 Overall Assessment&#13;
As a part of the institutional changes, the Department of Irrigation has already been re-designated&#13;
as Department of Water Resources. The Government of Orissa, as a follow up action, has already&#13;
constituted the Water Resources Board (WRB), the apex body of the state for development and&#13;
management of water resources of the state. The WRB is headed by the Chief Secretary of the&#13;
state. The WRB will decide about water allocation among the various water users. The above&#13;
institutional changes along with the long term integrated river basin plans to be formulated, will be&#13;
environmentally beneficial to the state. The rehabilitation of completed projects, to be taken up&#13;
under the OWRCP, will provide the tools for equitable water distribution among the users and for&#13;
a more sustainable development. This will facilitate upgrading and environmental protection for&#13;
various natural resources in the state of Orissa. The completion of on going economically viable&#13;
projects will ensure increase in food production and create employment opportunities in the rural&#13;
areas. As a whole, investments made under the OWRCP will be environmentally beneficial to the&#13;
state of Orissa.&#13;

Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
1.    Training and Technical Assistance. The extensive reorganization and institutional&#13;
strengthening to be undertaken under the project, and the major initiatives in the areas of water&#13;
planning, farmer participation and turnover, systems improvement, environmental management&#13;
and business skills such as management information systems and programming and budgeting,&#13;
would require substantial training and technical assistance throughout the DOWR. Training and&#13;
consultancy needs have been prepared by DOWR and the Bank for each management unit and are&#13;
detailed in their respective cost tables at Annex 18. Each CE would be responsible for managing&#13;
the specific training and consultancy relevant to his management unit, but would receive&#13;
administrative support frorfi a Training and Technical Assistance officer in the EIC's office.&#13;
Overall coordination of training for all management units would be through WALMI, using their&#13;
own resources or contracted training providers. The EIC would provide general guidance and&#13;
would balance the needs between DOWR units. Training would focus on strengthening skills in&#13;
all engineering areas including operations and maintenance, systems rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization (including major focus on the skills required for farmer organization and turnover)&#13;
water planning, environmental management, design and construction, and supporting skill&#13;
development associated with technologies or management techniques relatively new to DOWR&#13;
such as financial management skills, programming and budgeting, computerization, computer&#13;
aided design, remote sensing and management information systems. To allow for the transfer of&#13;
appropriate skills from consultants to DOWR staff, technical assistance would be linked in all&#13;
cases to staff training through association of staff with consultant assignments and interlinked&#13;
formal training as practicable. National and international study tours, training courses and&#13;
temporary assignments with experienced water agencies would also be used to provide first-hand&#13;
exposure to successful farmer organization &amp; turnover programs, new technologies in&#13;
engineering, water planning, environmental management, etc., and new corporate management&#13;
techniques.&#13;
2.    Consultancy arrangements would include small consultancies with individuals or firms as&#13;
needed, but would primarily be through a single contact throughout the project period under one&#13;
main consultancy and training contract comprising a "twinning arrangement" with an experienced&#13;
consultancy group. All consultancy selection would follow Bank guidelines. The twinning&#13;
arrangement would be with a consortium of several firms or specialist institutions, likely including&#13;
one international firm and one domestic firm, plus other firms/institutes as may be considered&#13;
appropriate in the offers by consortia and as may be accepted in final selection of the most&#13;
qualified offer. The central skill areas for an acceptable consortium, that might not be found in&#13;
one firm or agency, would comprise all aspects of irrigation engineering, water planning and&#13;
modeling, environmental management, and hands-on irrigation management, particularly in O&amp;M,&#13;
general and corporate management techniques, and beneficiary participation, plus capacity to&#13;
provide or arrange training in all of the above areas. The international firm or principal&#13;
international firm would be the lead partner and have overall responsibility for mobilizing the&#13;
consultancy and training support required. The contract would provide a basic expertise and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 255 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
training input annually, including some core senior staff providing continuity of visits, and access&#13;
to other specializations and training on an "as needed" basis, with flexibility retained and provided&#13;
for in the consultancy and training budget of the contract. Selection would be through an initial&#13;
invitation and subsequent prequalification of'interested firms (in their prequalification offers the&#13;
firms would advise of any intended partners), followed by short listing by DOWR of about 4&#13;
(range 3 to 5) firms or groups of firms for submission of detailed offers. A contract over the full&#13;
project period would be agreed at the outset, with flexibility for annual variations based on an&#13;
annual review of consultancy and related training needs between DOWR and the consortium in&#13;
consultation with GOO's OWRCP Project Monitoring Committee, and IDA. The above&#13;
procedures would provide the expertise required while limiting constraints frequently found in&#13;
India of obtaining individual clearances, especially for consultants and training requiring foreign&#13;
exchange. Suitably qualified and experienced NGOs would be recruited for implementation of the&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Action Plans (main report para 2.36 and Annex 10), and&#13;
as community organizers for farmer participation and turnover (main report para 2.13).&#13;
3.    Training. The DOWR has developed a flexible training program to satisfy its overall&#13;
training needs based on the present staff complement of about 2500 Junior Engineers and about&#13;
1200 engineers at Assistant Engineer level and above. These engineers must perform a wide&#13;
variety of technical and administrative duties related to water resource development and&#13;
management. The key to a successful training program over the life of WRCP will be to provide&#13;
for diversity among disciplines requiring training and to make the program flexible enough to&#13;
meet changing requirements of the DOWR including planning, design, construction, operations&#13;
and maintenance, the FOT program and administrative needs of an organization now poised for a&#13;
rapid technological evolution as exemplified in its plan for attaining modem Information&#13;
Technology status. Thus, reasonable contingencies in costing of an anticipated training program&#13;
have been allowed in the broad areas of water planning and plan formulation, construction&#13;
planning and design management, financial and administrative management, environmental&#13;
management, irrigation management, systems operation and maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
resettlement, telemetry and telecommunications, remote sensing and other advanced technologies,&#13;
as well as incorporate management skills and some social science areas. The consultancy and&#13;
training needs of the SIFT program, especially the farrmer organization and turnover aspects, may&#13;
require additional needs, particularly in training and staff visits in India and overseas to successful&#13;
examples of community participation and turnover. Further definition of training specialties to be&#13;
entered into are given in Attachment 1. As noted in para I above, it will also be incumbent upon&#13;
providers of Technical Assistance to include technology and know-how transfer as a central&#13;
feature within the TOR for OWRCP consultancies.&#13;
4.    Training providers will be many and diverse ranging from individual training consultants to&#13;
institutions, all of which have not as yet been identified. A summary of potential providers within&#13;
Orissa follow:&#13;
(a)   Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI)&#13;
(b)   Engineering College of four State universities&#13;
(c)   Gopandhu Institute of Administration Training (GIAT)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 256 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
(d)   Institute of Engineers, Orissa Chapter&#13;
(e)   Other private Firms and Institutions.&#13;
WALMI, which is also under administrative head of DOWR, conducts regular courses for the&#13;
benefit of engineers but is presently deficient in a number of specialties that will be required&#13;
throughout WRCP implementation. Nevertheless, it is intended that WALNI provide overall&#13;
coordination and identification of training activities as may be possible. WALMI would also be&#13;
strengthened in some core areas required for the OWRCP. It is also certain that all technical&#13;
training needs cannot be met by the State's engineering colleges nor would administrative training&#13;
by GIAT meet all requirements.&#13;
5.    It is apparent that a considerable number of primary training providers necessarily will be&#13;
from outside Orissa. These providers are many and diverse within India. A partial list being&#13;
considered by DOWR (by no means exhaustive), follows:&#13;
(a)   Central Water Commission (CWC), Central Training Unit&#13;
(b)   National Institute of Hydrology (NIH)&#13;
(c)   Central Board of Irrigation and Power (NBIP)&#13;
(d)   Water Resources Development Training Centre, University of Roorkee (UOR)&#13;
(e)   School of Hydrology, UOR&#13;
(f)    Water Technology Centers (various states)&#13;
(g)   WALMI (various state)&#13;
(h)   Indian Meteorological Department (IMID)&#13;
(i)   Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)&#13;
(j)   Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)&#13;
(k)   National Informatics Center (NIC)&#13;
(I)   Indian Institute of Technology (various locations)&#13;
(m)   National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)&#13;
(n)   National Council for Cement and Building Materials&#13;
(o)   Central Soils and Materials Research Stations&#13;
In addition, training at overseas institutes, centers and successful implementing agencies is also&#13;
envisaged, as well as the retention of overseas consultants for such purposes as may be necessary&#13;
from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 257 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
6.    The total estimated cost of training is Rs. 241 million of which Rs. 141 million would be&#13;
training from expatriate sources. The basic approach to costing is the upward envelope that 7 to&#13;
10 % of a professional staff member's service should be spent in training for upgrading specific&#13;
knowledge and skills. Due to the simultaneous nature of the DOWR's reorganization processes&#13;
and implementation of the WRCP, this rationale has been accepted as a starting point for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
7.    Technical Assistance. As in the case of training, the technical assistance (or consultancies)&#13;
program would be the administrative responsibility of the CE in charge of the respective DOWR&#13;
units, each requiring specialized attention. The agreed technical assistance requirements are&#13;
therefore envisaged in terms of the needs of the following principal DOWR management&#13;
activities: Environmental Action Plan; Water Planning; Information Technology; Project&#13;
Planning, Design, Construction and Quality Control; Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover&#13;
(SrFT); Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R); Training Consultant; Project Supervision; and&#13;
Operations and Maintenance Planning Consultancy. Also as in the case of Training and the&#13;
programmatic nature of the OWRCP implementation concept, which accepts a large degree of&#13;
uncertainty and provides capability to adjust to uncertainties over the project period, provision for&#13;
miscellaneous expenditures amounting to about 14% of total expatriate assistance and 17% of&#13;
total local assistance needs have been included in the program.&#13;
8.    Twinning Arrangements. Special provisions for Technical Assistance (TA) would be the&#13;
management support and overview provided by the EIC through his Training and Technical&#13;
Assistance officer. In addition, a continuous basis for the support to DOWR would be provided&#13;
by a "twinning arrangement" with an experienced consultant group or consortium which would&#13;
provide direct TA and training support or identify and arrange for services of other foreign or&#13;
national entities for such purpose. The twinning group would undertake comprehensive annual&#13;
review and report of TA and training needs and results, in consultation with the WRCP Project&#13;
Monitoring Committee and IDA. The profiles of the consultancy skills required under the&#13;
twinning arrangement is given in Attachment 2 and were agreed during negotiations.&#13;
9.    Project Monitoring Committees. Following agreement (prior to negotiations) of the final&#13;
membership and terms of responsibilities of the Project Monitoring Committee regarding future&#13;
WRCP consultancies, it is envisaged that the Project Monitoring Committee would comprise the&#13;
Secretaries of Water Resources (Chairman), Agriculture, Finance, Forest and Environment,&#13;
Welfare (R&amp;R), the EIC-DOWR, as well as leading professionals in the fields of agronomy,&#13;
agricultural economics, engineering, finance, etc. In addition to its overall role in Orissa state's&#13;
monitoring and supervision of the OWRCP, the Project Monitoring Committee would provide&#13;
general guidance to DOWR on consultancy and training needs and performance. The EIC-&#13;
DOWR would act as Member Secretary of the OWRCP Project Monitoring Committee and as&#13;
such receive and distribute all consultancy reports for review and comments and issue directives&#13;
regarding consultancy and training recommendations as necessary.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANCY SUPPORT - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
A. Technical Assistance Under OWRCP&#13;
A majority of technical assistance (TA) Positions (along with responsibilities and tasks)&#13;
identified under the OWRCP would be taken up under the twinning consortium (TWC)&#13;
arrangement as described above in para. 9 of Annex 13. As such, through the Bank's competitive&#13;
bidding process, a consortium comprising a multi-disciplinary international consulting firm (Lead&#13;
Consultant) and an Indian multi-disciplinary consultancy firm would be formed and selected to&#13;
provide administrative, technical and financial assistance to the GOO/DOWR continuously and/or&#13;
periodically as required for the duration of the project. Indicative consultancy position&#13;
descriptions are set out below giving the likely range of skills, experience and time allocations&#13;
required to provide the technical assistance under the twinning arrangements. They are identified&#13;
as a TWC (I) or International position, i.e., to be filled by the international provider and by TWC&#13;
(N), or National position, to be provided by the National (Indian) firm. A requirement of all the&#13;
ensuing interdisciplinary positions is the requisite education level in the respective disciplines with&#13;
preference to advanced university degrees in each case of equivalent qualified experience. In&#13;
addition, each position entails the specific responsibility of providing technology and skills transfer&#13;
to counterpart DOWR staff including all training possible within available time and resources&#13;
constraints.&#13;
Position No. 1. TWC (I): Consortium Leader - Institutional/Administrative&#13;
Management Specialist. Consortium leader qualifications would require long reputable&#13;
experience in the field of water and related land resources development including the substantial&#13;
career practice of detailed scientific-engineering inputs into those development processes. In&#13;
addition, career progress and experience should show steady growth into positions of increasing&#13;
responsibilities culminating in that of principal in charge of the successful implementation of major&#13;
public works programs and the management of organizations and/or institutions responsible for&#13;
such programs and works. Accordingly, the candidate should have preferably 25-years of&#13;
experience in practicing the above and related activities.&#13;
The Leader would be responsible for guiding overall assistance to the DOWR under the&#13;
twinning arrangements and in providing introductions and access to modern/internationally&#13;
available information, technical services and products (hard- and soft-ware) in the reformulation&#13;
and modernization of the DOWR. The TWC (1) specialist-leader should hold a full university&#13;
level and/or advanced engineering degree(s). Further, while the candidate must be intimately&#13;
familiar with technical and institutional/managerial aspects of water and related land resources&#13;
development, selection considerations would also be given to the variety and breadth of&#13;
experience in water and related land resources formulation requirements and policy&#13;
determinations. That is, experience in the overall strategic planning and coordination of water&#13;
resources and related matters would be an important consideration including technical as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

socio-economic and environmental aspects as may be required in the undertaking of long range&#13;
Basin and State level water planning inclucing policy and legislative matters (i.e., see Position No.&#13;
15). Specifically, in close coordination with the Institutional Strengthening Specialists (Positions&#13;
Nos. 26-31), the leader would need to overview and make appropriate recommendations&#13;
conceming DOWR's reorganization, assist establishment of position descriptions and&#13;
appointments and assignments duly consistent with the agreed reorganization and assist/prepare&#13;
codification of administrative/human resources including position classification requirements&#13;
within the system. The Leader would also be responsible, in close coordination with the Training&#13;
Advisor (Position Nos. 32-33) and the Chief Engineer-WALMI, for the Departmental review of&#13;
and recommendations concerning counterpart DOWR technical training needs under all twinning&#13;
arrangement consultancy disciplines. The intemational firm, represented by the Leader, will also&#13;
assist the arrangement and coordination of all intemational consultancies required under TWC&#13;
assistance arrangements as well as assure the transfer of technology and skills to counterpart&#13;
DOWR staff of respective TWC consultants in accordance with their required inputs.&#13;
This position (with support of the lead firm) requires performance of administrative and&#13;
management support responsibilities and tasks as given above, in close coordination with DOWR&#13;
counterparts throughout. The TWC Leader would be required to work closely and frequently&#13;
with the TWC (N) Deputy Leader (Position 2), as described below, including transfer of advanced&#13;
institutional support/technology as part of the overall TWC assistance package. It is anticipated&#13;
that the work load would decrease over the life of the project so that an estimated 26 weeks of&#13;
input would be required in Project Year (PY) 1 during 4 visits. Thereafter, requirements would&#13;
include: PY2-3, 4 visits/year of 4 weeks/visit or 16 weeks/year; PY4-5, 2 visits/year of 3&#13;
weeks/visit or 6 weeks/year; and PY6, I visit of 2 weeks duration.&#13;
Position No. 2. TWC (N): Deputy Consortium Leader--Water Resources&#13;
Development Engineer. This position would require a minimum of 15-years experience in and&#13;
principal responsibility for the performance of large water resources development&#13;
institutions/departments and/or firms in India. The deputy, supported by his firm, would require a&#13;
working knowledge of Advanced Technologies cited under TWC Position No. 15 (Planning&#13;
Engineer) as well as having a reasonable knowledge of the state-of-the-art,&#13;
institutional/technology requirements and related responsibilities of the Consortium as needed to&#13;
realize agreed DOWR modernization reform objectives. Full university degree(s) would be&#13;
required in related scientific disciplines, i.e., engineering and computer science.&#13;
The Deputy would be responsible for reviewing, administering and providing direct&#13;
support for and coordination of the TWC-arranged twinning assistance in accordance with the&#13;
agreed TOR. Intensive on-the-ground assistance in Orissa would be required on a full time basis&#13;
for what is estimated to be a minimum of 240 days/year (48 weeks/year). Participation with&#13;
DOWR and TWC (I) Lead firm in all components, goals and phases of OWRCP implementation&#13;
would be required with gradual transfer of most leadership and administrative responsibilities to&#13;
the Deputy position over the project life.&#13;

Position No. 3. TWC (I) and Position No. 4. TWC(N): Civil Engineers-Design and&#13;
Construction (Dams, Spillways, Canals, Distribution Works, Hydraulic Structures).&#13;
Positions 3 and 4 would be similar in terms of responsibilities and tasks, but one would be filled&#13;
by an expert from the international community on a short-term basis to ensure technology transfer&#13;
and access to international practices and one from the Indian community on a longer-term basis to&#13;
ensure continuity of modem practices. These participants would be accountable, respectively, for&#13;
modernization of present design and construction practices to accepted international and national&#13;
standards with focus on assistance needed under the Scheme Completions component and as&#13;
would be required to modernize practices throughout the DOWR. Full participation with those&#13;
having primary responsibility for implementation of modernization goals under the Institutional&#13;
Strengthening/Capacity Building (IS/CB) component as well as full cooperation with the TWC' s&#13;
Leader and Deputy Leader for such purpose also would be required. Work requirements in each&#13;
case would be based on a minimum of 15-years of professional experience in combinations of the&#13;
respective specialties listed below. Under technical assistance arrangements, transfer of technical&#13;
capabilities and skills to DOWR staff would be accomplished earliest possible including&#13;
modernization of the following specialty categories of civil works construction practices including&#13;
recognition of: Indian and International standards and criteria; contract management and&#13;
contractor relations; and, quality control and assurance including standards and criteria, and&#13;
inspection and testing procedures. In addition, assistance would be required to establish a&#13;
computer-based reporting system for M&amp;E including all requirements for tracking works,&#13;
materials, equipment and facilities. That is, the system would address and solve DOWR-wide&#13;
report standards, level of detail, and frequency of reports covering: management and personnel&#13;
decisions at all departmental levels including control/management of physical and financial&#13;
progress through selection and installation of appropriate CPM-type management and scheduling&#13;
hard- and soft-ware program capabilities.&#13;
This position, 3 (I), accordingly, would coordinate closely with position 4 (N), described&#13;
below, in modernizing civil design and construction practices and in assisting selection and&#13;
installation of a computer-based reporting system and in transferring modern technical standards,&#13;
criteria and procedures and related technologies to the DOWR. Short term participation would&#13;
be required including two (2) visits per year with average duration of 8 weeks/year for PY 1-3.&#13;
Position 4 (N) accordingly, would require close coordination and cooperation with Position 3 (I)&#13;
in all the above aspects of modernization responsibilities. Thereby, intensive long-term&#13;
participation would be required for the life of project with increasing levels of responsibility being&#13;
transferred progressively to the national position throughout implementation. This would&#13;
comprise quarterly visits to Orissa from within India at a rate of 4 weeks/quarter; or, 16&#13;
weeks/year for PY1-6.&#13;
Position No. 5. TWC (N): Mechanical/Electrical Engineer. This consultancy would&#13;
require the review of DOWR's current mechanical/electric engineering practices, criteria and&#13;
standards followed by the provision of assistance in taking modernization steps as may be&#13;
required including assurance that applicable national and international practices would be&#13;

based) suitable for interfacing with and affecting (modifying) results of ongoing physical river&#13;
basin water and related land resources modeling, i.e. with emphases on the 2nd and 3rd stages of&#13;
completion of the river basin water and related land use plans to be under taken sequentially as&#13;
part of the State water Plan prior to its completion in year 2002. For such consultancy, a&#13;
minimum of 10-years of econometric modeling and/or closely related experience would be&#13;
required with at least 5-years of related computer based modeling required. Immediate provision&#13;
of initial ground work will be needed to plan the proposed development model and identify and&#13;
prepare the necessary econometric data bases in cooperation with the affected GOO departments&#13;
and the DOWR in order to determine current status (base conditions) in socio-economic terms of&#13;
basins and sub-basin conditions in Orissa and to develop sectoral projections therefore. This&#13;
process will of necessity require the immediate and close participation of responsible counterpart&#13;
DOWR staff in providing the required data bases and in the model's development and verification.&#13;
This position requires relatively intensive, long term input into the State water and related&#13;
land resources planning effort. Assistance would be required of this International consultant in all&#13;
of the above responsibilities/duties with full time support required of select counterpart DOWR&#13;
Planning Unit staff. The effort would also require aggressive support of all other pertinent&#13;
cooperating Departments of GOO through the previously established intradepartmental&#13;
coordination arrangements. It is estimated that input at a rate of one visit of 3 weeks per quarter&#13;
or 12 weeks/year will be required for PY1-2 and 2 visits/year of 4 weeks/visit or 8 weeks/year for&#13;
PY3-5.&#13;
F. Institutional Strengthening /Capacity Building (IS/CB) Component&#13;
Position No. 26 TWC(I) &amp; 27. TWC (N): Institutional/Organizational Specialists.&#13;
In order to provide the level and depth of assistance to DOWR necessary for successful&#13;
implementation of its agreed modernization objectives, these consultancies would require long&#13;
experience (minimum of 20-years) in administering/managing and being responsible overall for the&#13;
day to day operations of a major international public works development organization and/or&#13;
private firm. Specific knowledge of government operations will be an important consideration in&#13;
the selection of suitable candidates. The principle focus would be on assisting the smooth&#13;
transition from present to modernized status of the DOWR during the multi-faceted&#13;
implementation of its reorganization in terms of the overall administrative, managerial, technical&#13;
and human resources (personnel) requirements. The position would take the lead in institutional&#13;
reform and computerization of the department primarily through the coordination of activities&#13;
under positions 28-3 1. Assistance would be required in continuing the detailed identification and&#13;
description of all positions within the DOWR and thereafter in expeditiously filling such positions&#13;
in context of the SAR agreed reorganization objectives and plans and, specifically in context of&#13;
achieving modernization objectives including the proposed computer-based Management&#13;
Information System (MIS). Accordingly, this position, although critically needed for successful&#13;
reorganization, would not require specific knowledge of computer based MIS networks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

However, it would require very close coordination with those MIS and Information Technology&#13;
(IT) specialists that are charged with responsibility for the Department-wide establishment of the&#13;
computer-based MIS system and the requisite communications (voice and data transmission)&#13;
networks for its implementation including provision of direct assistance to those experts in&#13;
rationalizing, formulating and formatting position codifications/classifications and scoping&#13;
personnel job responsibilities and providing interfaces between quantitative (physical)&#13;
performance and cost accounting/budgetary and administrative channels.&#13;
These consultancies would require substantial early input during position placement&#13;
decisions and actions and during initial detailed MIS personnel, management, technical, cost&#13;
accounting and budgeting codifications and classifications input. Therefore, it is estimated, that a&#13;
minimum of Position 26 (I), 2 visits/year of 2 weeks duration in PY1-2 and I visit of 2 weeks in&#13;
PY3. For position 27(N), the requirement is assessed at 4 visits/ year of 6 weeks duration PY1-2&#13;
and 4 visits of 2 weeks duration PY3.&#13;
Position Nos. 28. to 31.: Management/Technology/Communications Information&#13;
System Specialists. Establishment of a functional modem (computer driven) MIS is a principally&#13;
agreed objective and cornerstone of the agreed DOWR modernization steps including&#13;
achievement of comprehensive, fully integrated and functional design, development and&#13;
implementation of such system. As such the proposed MIS, upon completion and verification,&#13;
would satisfy the Department's reorganization objectives and interface with and/or be compatible&#13;
with overall administrative and reporting requirements of the GOO including all programming and&#13;
budgeting, financial accounting management reporting and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
requirements. Successful establishment of the proposed MIS would require qualitative and&#13;
quantitative utilization including substantial input of the types and levels of administrative,&#13;
financial and Information Technology (IT) consultancies herein described under Positions 28&#13;
through 31, respectively. A task team consisting primarily of these positions would have&#13;
responsibility to design the information needs of the Department and supervision the procurement&#13;
of equipment including computer systems and installation and commissioning of the management&#13;
information system(s) including communication. This task has a high priority and should be&#13;
completed by the end of PY4. The indicative allowance for the total task is 224 weeks, divided&#13;
evenly at this stage between each position 28-31.&#13;
Position No 28. TWC (N): MIS Computerization Expert. This position would&#13;
provide the lead detailed technical assistance to DOWR in the design of the overall computer-&#13;
based MIS. Such assistance would be based on the above stated objectives including details of&#13;
administrative, functional and financial steps including classifications and codifications necessary&#13;
to achieve a fully integrated and functional computer driven system within and for the daily use of&#13;
the entire Department. For such purpose, the lead MIS consultant would be required to have a&#13;
minimum of 10 -years of directly applicable experience of consulting about and/or managing large&#13;
institutionaUGovernment organizations and/or large corporations including substantial experience&#13;
in directing the actual steps and processes required for completed reorganization steps and&#13;
modernization. The MIS lead consultant would have to work closely with the other&#13;
modernization consultants, initially with the Institutional Specialists (Positions No. 29) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

thereafter with all others (Position Nos. 31-33) who will be responsible for Financial&#13;
Management, Communications and the M&amp;E modernization assistance in completing MIS&#13;
implementation. Such lead consultant would also of necessity coordinate/cooperate closely with&#13;
DOWR counterpart staff, responsible for description, demonstration and selection of appropriate&#13;
hard- and soft-ware for achieving computer-based MIS objectives including codification schemes&#13;
(and their evaluation and selection) appropriate for use in DOWR's existing State&#13;
financial/budgetary, human resources and physical monitoring systems with the goal of&#13;
transferring the relevant technology and skills as quickly as possible.&#13;
Emphasis would be on the earliest possible establishment of a computer-based MIS to be&#13;
further based on administrative, technical and financial management requirements that would&#13;
support the agreed institutional reform objectives of the DOWR. Specific responsibilities would&#13;
include the review, supervision and coordination of long term implications of the ongoing (or&#13;
soon to be awarded) Consultancy on "Information Technology" and recommendations of any&#13;
additional steps required to achieve the following objectives:&#13;
(a) Preparation of a strategic plan for the implementation/use of Information Technology&#13;
(IT) throughout DOWR;&#13;
(b) Planned actions to establish an integrated MIS with system specifications for all&#13;
functions and levels of DOWR;&#13;
(c) Design details of the system and its components;&#13;
(d) Procurement of required works and equipment (hardware and software);&#13;
(e) Training of personnel; and&#13;
(f) Establishment of a fully codified and integrated operational system including hard-and&#13;
soft-ware and a State-wide voice and data transmission communication network.&#13;
This position will require substantial input including intensive input during early years of&#13;
implementation. Accordingly, it is estimated that inputs for PY1-2 would comprise one 4-week&#13;
visit/quarter or 16 weeks/year for coordination and detailed assistance along with other&#13;
information technologists; thereafter, it is estimated that levels of 4 visits/year of 3 weeks/visit or&#13;
12 weeks/year will be required for PY3-4 and one visit of 4 weeks/year for PY5-6 for fine tuning&#13;
and upgrading.&#13;
Position No. 29. TWC (N): Financial Management Consultant. This consultant&#13;
would assist the design, testing, integration, codification and verification of a DOWR-wide&#13;
computer driven system for financial management and control of all DOWR activities and&#13;
programs including cost/expenditure accounting, budget allocations and projections, and&#13;
attendant reporting requirements for all effected units/activities within DOWR and GOO.&#13;
This position requires performance of duties mentioned above in close coordination with&#13;
other MIS requirements and consultancies and counterpart DOWR staff as needed to establish its&#13;
overall integration into a fully functional system. Accordingly, it is estimated that intensive inputs&#13;
would be required in PY1-2 comprising up to 20 weeks/year. Thereafter, it is estimated that a&#13;
further 28 and 8 weeks respectively would be required in PY2-3.&#13;

Position No. 30. TWC (N): Communications System Expert. This consultant would&#13;
require a minimum of 15-years of experience in state-of-the-art communication systems and&#13;
devices. The consultant would also be responsible for review of and recommendations about the&#13;
implementation details, content and procedures as may be required concerning the design and&#13;
installation of an optimum State-wide intra-departmental communication network for transmission&#13;
of data and voice communications as necessary to achieve a computer based MIS. Such&#13;
establishment would encompass modem information technology goals/standards/criteria as&#13;
needed within Orissa to achieve desired improvements in efficiency including increased staff&#13;
productivity and responsiveness to client needs. Therefore, specific knowledge is required of&#13;
existing and planned voice/data systems including telephonic, telemetry, VHF/UHF radio&#13;
networks and satellite-based or other utilizable (combined) data and voice transmission systems,&#13;
such knowledge to be transferred to DOWR counterpart staff as early and efficiently as possible&#13;
during early project implementation stages.&#13;
This position would require performance of the above responsibilities and tasks in close&#13;
coordination with all other MIS communication delivery requirements and with overall DOWR&#13;
data and voice transmission needs. Accordingly, it is estimated that high intensity input would be&#13;
required during early design and selection phases of implementation and would be reduced&#13;
periodically until the integrated communication system is fully installed and proven functional.&#13;
Accordingly, it is estimated that input as follows would be required: An allowance of 56 weeks&#13;
has been made for this position to be programmed over PY1-3.&#13;
Position No. 31. TWC (N): Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant. This consultant would&#13;
require a minimum of 10 -years of direct experience in M&amp;E related processes and products. The&#13;
consultant would be responsible for proposing, evaluating and selecting/recommending a&#13;
computer-based M&amp;E system for purpose of tracking and controlling status and progress of&#13;
project component implementation initiatives and cross-relating them within and across the newly&#13;
established DOWR organization including: physical (contract administration/force account) and&#13;
financial/budgetary (cost/budgetary accounting) progress as well as providing personnel (human&#13;
resources)status at project-wide and basin levels, all of which would be aggregated upward from&#13;
field units through Divisions and Directorates to the DepartmentaUSecretarial levels in a&#13;
necessarily conformed report format and provide for top to bottom feed back as would be&#13;
necessary to induce/motivate actions required as may be the case. This reporting system and&#13;
format and its content would contain, with varying levels of detail, timely information as would be&#13;
appropriate to advise each administrative level being addressed as to the status of progress and&#13;
provide early warning of pending shortfalls (physical and/or financial) and important&#13;
implementation issues as they arise. As such, appropriate computer hard- and soft-ware&#13;
packages (i.e., computer based CPM systems like Primavera or other Planner/Scheduling&#13;
programs) as may be required for carrying out the above steps would be subject to evaluation and&#13;
selection thence adoption, utilizing recommendations of the expert consultant.&#13;
This position requires close coordination of the above responsibilities and tasks with other&#13;
MIS/IT technologists as a means (among other requirements) of providing proper interface and&#13;

conversion between physical performance (progress) in the field and financial reporting&#13;
requirements and budgetary resources/needs at all levels for which hard and software packages&#13;
and procedures exist. Accordingly, the need for this consultancy is greatest in the first three years&#13;
of the project. Again, an indicative 56 weeks has been allocated and activity should be&#13;
programmed in the period PY 1-3.&#13;
weeks/year.&#13;
Position No. 32. TWC (I) &amp; 33 TWC(N): Training Advisors. These consultants&#13;
would be responsible for conducting a thorough review of all of DOWR's training needs in&#13;
accordance with its new modernization objectives and organizational requirements and,&#13;
accordingly recommending specific time-bound training programs consistent with personnel and&#13;
organizational unit requirements. Required National and international training requirements in&#13;
terms of seminars and courses (including curricula, etc.), tours etc., would be identified in detail in&#13;
coordination with respective DOWR leadership and staff including the proposed provider whether&#13;
National or international including detailed estimates of costs for budgeting and control purposes.&#13;
Development of a master training program for the life of the project would be required initially for&#13;
planning and budgeting purposes; however, implementation of individual segments of training on&#13;
an semi-annual and annual basis including detailed arrangements with providers, venue, etc., and&#13;
sanction of foreign currency requirements, if any, will of necessity be flexible and in accordance&#13;
with changing requirements of the Department and its administrative units over time.&#13;
It is estimated that this consultancy would require the following schedule and level of&#13;
commitment: Position 32, PYI-2, 4 visits/year to Orissa with a duration of 3-weeks/visit or a&#13;
total of 12 weeks/year. For position 33, the assessed need is for 4 visits/year of about 3 weeks&#13;
duration over the period PY1-2 with a further 2 visits of 4 weeks duration in PY3.&#13;
Position No. 34. TWC (N): Public Awareness and Information (PA&amp;I) Consultant.&#13;
This consultant would: (a) be responsible for assisting the design and implementation of a Public&#13;
Relations Program for DOWR that would have as an ultimate goal the promotion of the DOWR&#13;
as a user-friendly public services organization with emphasis on design, construction and O&amp;M&#13;
services sought, planned and achieved including improved status of environmental basin and&#13;
project planning objectives. The consultant would also provide frequent and informative notices&#13;
of actions/unavoidable disruptions in service or unavoidable disruptions to the public art large due&#13;
to construction and/or O&amp;M activities, etc., on a regular and consistent basis to water&#13;
clients/users and the affected public; and (b) assist the proposed PA&amp;I Unit in designing a system&#13;
for notification of and eligibility for needed Public Participation in planned activities of the&#13;
Department, i.e., of project beneficiaries and NGOs and others as required, and thereafter for&#13;
carrying out/implementing Public Participation activities and/or goals.&#13;
This position is estimated to require a medium level of assistance through out the life of&#13;
the project as may be required to fulfill the above responsibilities/tasks. It is therefore estimated&#13;
that during PY 1-4 about 4 visits/year of 2 weeks/visit or an input of 8 weeks/year would be&#13;
needed, and during PY5-6 an average of 2 visits/year of 2 weeks/visit or 4 weeks/year would be&#13;
required.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Information Technology (IT)&#13;
I.    Plans of the DOWR to carry out a revolution in communication among and between all&#13;
departments, disciplines and administrative units are comprehensive and commendable. Steps&#13;
have been taken to identify a consultant who would advise the Department on the next steps to be&#13;
taken for implementation of the proposed Information Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP). Such&#13;
proposal was derived during a recent WRCP preparation study by the Snowy Mountains&#13;
Engineering Corporation (SMEC) of Australia in collaboration with the Basin Planning&#13;
Directorate. The study report is titled "Information System Review". The study addressed: the&#13;
current situation in terms of DOWR's functional units, the clients and users of data, data inputs&#13;
and outputs, and training requirements; the direction of changes undertaken or proposed&#13;
elsewhere; and, suggested detailed IT requirements of DOWR in the immediate, mid-term and&#13;
long term future scenarios. The study recommended development of the proposed ITSP to take&#13;
advantage of technologies presently available in the market as might be needed to meet future&#13;
needs of the Department. The IT undertaking will be a valuable link in the Basin Planning process&#13;
and therefore needs to be accelerated through early identification, procurement and installation of&#13;
advanced data transmission and processing equipment among key planning, design, program,&#13;
budget and accounts as well as monitoring and evaluation staff and among key management units&#13;
within DOWR. The status of preparation of this component is in the attached table.&#13;
2.    A component-wise implementation schedule costing Rs. 512 million (US$ 16 million) has&#13;
been proposed by DOWR for implementation of the required Information Technology&#13;
improvements. While such costs are likely adequate in financial terms to launch the initial phase&#13;
of the program under WRCP, preparation of an ITSP with Consultant assistance will be required&#13;
to verify the feasibility of the present plans and implementation strategies. Ample contingency&#13;
costs have been included under the Technical Assistance component to cover such consultancy&#13;
requirements. This assistance would have as a principal objective verification of the present&#13;
DOWR proposal. In addition, the consultant would make alternative proposals including&#13;
identification of additional detailed consultancies as may be needed, over the implementation&#13;
period. Staged procurement and management of an Information Technology system will be&#13;
required over the WRCP period. Associated consultancies would cover details such as identifying&#13;
and installing appropriately specified hard and software, space accommodations, a reliable energy&#13;
source including back-up electric power and electrical equipment and a reliable communications&#13;
network. Implementation of the Information Technology component would require a large staff&#13;
training program for the entire 7-year period of WRCP implementation, with emphasis on the&#13;
initial phases of implementation especially in the use of computers. Funding for this component,&#13;
including training has been included under the WRCP.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Criteria For Preparation and Selection of Investment Program&#13;
Introduction.&#13;
1.    One of the objectives of Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project is to initiate a&#13;
fundamental re-prioritization of public expenditures in the water resources development sector in&#13;
line with Orissa's State Water Policy and the recommendations in the India Irrigation Sector&#13;
Review and the India Public Expenditure Review. GOO proposes to allocate public expenditure&#13;
on the ongoing program according to priorities established in such a way as to achieve benefits&#13;
from the ongoing program optimally both in time and content. It therefore follows that any future&#13;
additions to DOWR's program should be based on well established criteria to further the above&#13;
objectives.&#13;
2.    The OWRCP investments within the six year implementation period of the project are&#13;
directed to institutional strengthening; rehabilitation and modernization of selected existing&#13;
irrigation schemes; and completion of selected ongoing viable schemes. Apart from schemes&#13;
included in the OWRCP investment program as pre-approved schemes, there are other schemes in&#13;
initial construction phase and also in planning stage. GOO would also be taking up river basin&#13;
water resource planning for multi-uses as a part of the OWRCP, which could bring up with due&#13;
prioritization the need to include some additional projects in the program. In order to allow for&#13;
investment assistance from IDA for such developments a special Category for Unidentified&#13;
Schemes has been established under the Scheme Completions component. Approval of IDA for&#13;
inclusion of any such future schemes under the OWRCP would be dependent upon their satisfying&#13;
the set of criteria outlined below.&#13;
3.    More broadly, the same criteria should also be applied to other future investments&#13;
implemented by DOWR with government funding or with other external assistance. IDA's role&#13;
regarding any such other investments would necessarily be limited to a more macro perspective.&#13;
The key consideration for IDA would be that DOWR's overall expenditure program&#13;
corresponded to agreed sectoral priorities and that funding and DOWR staff efforts were&#13;
concentrated on a limited number of work sites enabling, for each site, high quality technical&#13;
implementation and full funding commensurate with implementation capacity. DOWR's overall&#13;
expenditure program would be reviewed in detail annually during DOWR's Annual Review,&#13;
Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) exercise, which would be the principal vehicle for assuring the&#13;
WRCP's expenditure prioritization objectives (main text paras 2.42 to 2.44 and 4.05). For&#13;
evaluation of specific investment proposals, it would also be in Orissa's clear interest to apply the&#13;
criteria below to all future water sector investments, even when not specifically funded under the&#13;
OWRCP. Accordingly, DOWR intends that the criteria would be applied generally to all its&#13;
investment proposals. Adherence to this would be broadly monitored by IDA and discussed with&#13;
DOWR/GOO at the time of each ARAPB. This would also be a special focus of Orissa states'&#13;
Project Monitoring Committee (main report, para 4.18). More formally, GOO would oversee the&#13;
project's expenditure prioritization focus through its "High Powered Committee" (main report,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 289 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
para. 2.44). DOWR would be required to submit all investment proposals through the HPC,&#13;
whici would both assess the proposal in the context of DOWR's overall expenditure program and&#13;
sectoral priorities and insist, through the Project Monitoring Committee, on any such investment&#13;
meeting in full, the agreed Preparation and Selection criteria below.&#13;
Preparation and Selection Criteria&#13;
Schemes proposed for investment under DOWR's program should be:&#13;
(a)  prepared in the context of a river basin development considering all water use needs;&#13;
(b)  well prepared from all engineering, agriculture and other technical perspectives;&#13;
(c)  economically viable;&#13;
(d)  in full compliance with environmental and social requirements; and&#13;
(e)  identified and prepared in full consultation with beneficiaries.&#13;
To these effects, the following ten criteria will be applied for preparation of investment proposals&#13;
and for their evaluation and approval:&#13;
I.    Basin Planning. The scheme should be prepared in the context of a river basin plan taking&#13;
into account probable competing demands on the water source to be developed and should fit into&#13;
an overall river basin or sub-basin development plan prepared by the Orissa Water Planning&#13;
Organization (OWPO) of DOWR.&#13;
II.    Water Demand. Estimates of water demand should be prepared taking into account the&#13;
economic life of the proposed scheme. In the case of municipal and industrial sectors such&#13;
estimates would be provided by the respective entities responsible. OWPO should ensure that&#13;
these estimates cover a projected service period and specify the degree of reliability required. In&#13;
the case of irrigation schemes.. crop water requirements should be prepared on the basis of&#13;
climatic data using standard methodology taking into account the contribution of effective rainfall.&#13;
In estimating these demands, soils and land suitability for potential crops to be grown under the&#13;
scheme should be established based on the data obtained from the agriculture department, and&#13;
future crops, cropping patterns and crop calendars should be established in consultation with&#13;
agriculture department officials and farmers.&#13;
III.   Water Availability. Assessment of water availability should be based on detailed&#13;
hydrological studies and reservoir yield analysis using standard methodology. Quality of water&#13;
service proposed from the scheme must meet prevalent standards for raw water supply to&#13;
municipalities or water boards, industries and agriculture. In the case of irrigation schemes&#13;
availability of ground water in the command must be identified to establish possibility of&#13;
conjunctive use which must be reflected in water balance computations. Analysis of existing&#13;
infrastructure to clearly identify possible measures such as improving existing storage and&#13;
efficiency of delivery systems should be prepared and the necessity to build new storage should be&#13;
clearly established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 290 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
IV.   Engineering. Detailed engineering designs based on adequate investigations and studies,&#13;
technical specifications, implementation schedules based on DOWR capability; and procurement&#13;
packages and schedules should be prepared. If the scheme involves construction of a dan with&#13;
maximum height more than 10 meters, the designs 3hould be reviewed by an independent Dam&#13;
Safety Review Panel appointed with the concurrence of IDA.&#13;
V.    Operation and Maintenance Plan. Detailed O&amp;M plan for the scheme should be prepared&#13;
clearly spelling out the role of the end user in the plan implementation, and financial and technical&#13;
inputs required on a recurrent basis with an indication of how these requirements would be met.&#13;
VI.   Environmental Assessment. Environmental impact studies should be carried out, required&#13;
mitigating measures identified and an action plan to implement such measures prepared. Riparian&#13;
rights on water resource proposed for the scheme development should be assessed, as also impact&#13;
on downstream users. In the event of a downstream user being affected, a counter impact scheme&#13;
should be prepared or suitable remedial measures should be identified and included in the&#13;
development of the scheme.&#13;
VII.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation &amp; Indigenous Peoples Development. Baseline&#13;
socioeconomic surveys of the project affected persons (PAPs) should be conducted in respect of&#13;
both the reservoir area and the pipeline or other delivery system. This should include information&#13;
regarding indigenous PAPs in reservoir areas or delivery system locations. Land acquisition,&#13;
resettlement and economic rehabilitation action plans (RAPs), with realistic cost estimates and&#13;
implementation schedules, should be prepared and incorporated in the project report. Where&#13;
applicable, indigenous peoples development plans (IPDPs), also with realistic cost estimates and&#13;
implementation schedules, should be prepared and incorporated in the project report.&#13;
VIII. Costs and Benefits. Detailed cost estimates should be prepared based on prevailing prices,&#13;
and suitable provision for physical and price contingencies should be made. Total costs should&#13;
include R&amp;R costs arising from the R&amp;R and environment impact assessments. Annual recurrent&#13;
costs based on the O&amp;M plan should be incorporated. In the case of irrigation schemes an&#13;
estimate of annual net agricultural benefits should be made taking into account existing agriculture&#13;
support services and an analysis of the markets for agriculture produce. A detailed study on&#13;
farming systems should be carried out and financial impact of the scheme on the beneficiary&#13;
farmers should be estimated.&#13;
IX.   Economic Viability. Detailed economic analysis should be carried out using standard&#13;
methodology (refer FAOCP reports for approved schemes). For a scheme to be economically&#13;
viable, the economic rate of return should be 12% or greater. Social factors such as poverty&#13;
alleviation, regional development etc., which could influence choice amongst similar investment&#13;
options, may also be documented.&#13;
X.    Cost Recovery. For irrigation schemes, terms of cost recovery and farmer responsibilities&#13;
in O&amp;M should be agreed through a memorandum of understanding. For schemes incorporating&#13;
bulk water supply, cost of the component for such supply should be established and agreement on&#13;
financial terms of supply with the user agency should be drawn. Legal agreements as needed&#13;
should be prepared.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Criteria for the Selection of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
The project would seek NGO participation in various activities related to: farmer&#13;
organization and beneficiary participation in management, operation and maintenance of irrigation&#13;
systems; resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons; and to the indigenous&#13;
peoples development plans (IPDPs). Based on a Terms of Reference prepared by DOWR and&#13;
made available to NGOs, Orissa's Department of Water Resources (DOWR) would solicit from&#13;
interested NGOs detailed proposals for collaboration. DOWR would be responsible for reviewing&#13;
the proposals and agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NGOs in the project. The&#13;
selection of NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   as part of legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body under the&#13;
relevant State Law. It should regularly maintain its accounting records and have properly&#13;
audited annual statement of income and expenditure;&#13;
(b)   Since the program involves working primarily with small and marginal farmers, it is&#13;
essential that the NGO has a proven track record in community development in the&#13;
agrarian setting. To avoid creating any biases and misconceptions in the minds of the&#13;
people, the NGO should be secular and non-political in the conduct of its field activities;&#13;
(c)   As the project requires NGO support for farmer organization activities over many&#13;
sites, and for R&amp;R/IPDPs in seven completion sub-projects, NGO's should have adequate&#13;
numbers of field level staff conversant with the local dialect and customs, and having a&#13;
clear understanding of the socioeconomic and political situation of the area or areas in&#13;
which they will operate. They should also possess excellent communication skills and&#13;
good rapport with the community so as to involve them in their own farmer organization&#13;
or economic rehabilitation;&#13;
(d)   A prior understanding of the concept of the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation&#13;
Project and experience in areas relevant to the NGO's interest in project participation (for&#13;
instance, in community development, farmer organization, resettlement and rehabilitation,&#13;
tribal welfare) would be desirable. Owing to the nature and extent of the physical&#13;
coverage of the program, each selected NGO will be part of the community organization&#13;
or R&amp;R/IPDP process. Hence, the NGO should be able to interact smoothly with, and be&#13;
a part of, a team; and&#13;
(e)   Finally, the NGO should have internal stability so as to assure long-term support to&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Baseline Survey Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
I.    The objective of a baseline survey are twofold: (i) it should provide the necessary&#13;
information to assess the current situation before significant project implementation at field level&#13;
takes place and (ii) establish development perfornance indicators to monitor and evaluate project&#13;
success. Based on the assessment of the current situation the baseline survey would provide&#13;
simple and low cost performance indicators to monitor project success continuously for all project&#13;
areas. Performance indicators form part of the performance review of a particular activity to be&#13;
measured against specified objectives. To further gain experience in monitoring project success&#13;
of this and other Water Resource Consolidation Projects in other Indian states, a more detailed&#13;
baseline survey followed by more detailed monitoring will be carried out in selected commands.&#13;
The baseline survey and the development of the performance indicators is an interdisciplinary&#13;
product jointly produced by irrigation engineers, agricultural scientists/economists, remote sensing&#13;
specialists, and water resource managers.&#13;
2.    The following list gives examples of possible performance indicators for specific project&#13;
activities. The necessary information for the indicators should be obtained through the baseline&#13;
survey in order to assess the current situation. The list is meant as a suggestion of possible&#13;
indicators. It is neither complete nor do all of the suggested indicators have to be used for the&#13;
monitoring process. It is essential to keep the monitoring process as simple as possible in order to&#13;
reduce the workload on field staff.&#13;
(a) Engineering indicators for operation performance:&#13;
i)    Actual dates of irrigation versus planned dates of irrigation.&#13;
ii)    Variations in the flow at main canal and distributary heads as a ratio of&#13;
their planned discharges.&#13;
iii)    Variations in the flow at main canal and distributary tail clusters as a ratio&#13;
of their planned discharges.&#13;
iv)    Volume of the water received at the distributary head as a ratio of water&#13;
discharged at the main canal head.&#13;
(b) Engineering indicators for maintenance performance:&#13;
i)    Actual capacity of main canal and distributaries as a ratio of their design&#13;
capacities.&#13;
&#13;

ii)    Maintenance cost per kilometer of canal/drain system maintenance broken&#13;
up in 3-4 categories of different ranges of canal sizes.&#13;
iii)   Maintenance cost per hectare of command area.&#13;
iv)   Actual maintenance expenditures versus budget targets.&#13;
v)    Actual area irrigated as a percentage of planned area.&#13;
(c) Agricultural production indicators for performance of scheme completions,&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization investments.&#13;
i)    Area receiving full, partial and no canal water supplies as a ratio of total&#13;
command.&#13;
ii)    Production of three principal irrigated crops.&#13;
iii)   Changes of crop yields in relation to the previous year.&#13;
iv)   Changes in the cropping pattern in relation to the previous year.&#13;
v)    Changes of farm income in relation to the previous year.&#13;
vi)   Amount and value of the three principal crops as a ratio of water deliveries.&#13;
vii)   Amount of water received per crop (irrigation and rainfall) as a ratio of&#13;
crop water requirements.&#13;
(d) Remote sensing to indicate performance of scheme compietions, rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization investments at a command level.&#13;
i)    Total area under irrigation.&#13;
ii)    Changes in the cropping pattern.&#13;
(e) Performance indicators for the institutional restructuring of DOWR.&#13;
i)    Reorganisational benchmarks achieved.&#13;
ii)    Benchmarks of environmental action plan achieved.&#13;
iii)   Progress on basin/state water resource planning.&#13;
iv)   Programming and budgeting plans formulated and submitted on schedule.&#13;
v)    Annual training program for DOWR personnel approved on schedule by&#13;
EIC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 17&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
vi)   Number of senior engineers who received management training.&#13;
(f)   Performance indicator for farmer turnover program.&#13;
i)    Number of farmer councils at distributary level established and&#13;
participating:&#13;
a) in planning distributary works,&#13;
b) in joint management with DOWR,&#13;
c) and taking responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;
ii)    Amount of funds collected by farmer councils for maintenance work at&#13;
distributary.&#13;
iii)   Number of farmer councils requesting and involved in state 2&#13;
improvements.&#13;
iv)   Number of apex committees established and working.&#13;
v)    Number of farmer councils having problems.&#13;
3.    More detailed baseline field surveys would be conducted on about five schemes under the&#13;
Systems Improvement Program. These surveys would involve field units, a stratified farm survey&#13;
and intensive remote sensing support with field verification. Schemes would be chosen for their&#13;
representativeness under different conditions. For the scheme completions, only limited&#13;
supplemental data of the current situation is probably required (crops grown, agricultural yields,&#13;
incomes, social conditions, etc.). Three to four scheme completion sites would be chosen.&#13;
4.    Appropriately experienced universities and/or research institutions would be chosen in&#13;
consultation with IDA, to conduct the work. The survey would be funded by IDA as part of the&#13;
OWRCP's technical assistance provision.&#13;
5.    On completion of the survey, the Monitorable indicators above and at Annex 22&#13;
Attachment 5, would be appropriately modified, and modifications included in DOWR's quarterly&#13;
and annual reporting system (main text, para 4.05) and IDA supervision reports. The baseline&#13;
survey would also form a starting yardstick for DOWR's monitoring and evaluation activities&#13;
(main text, para 4.04) and for the project's Implementation Completion Report.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.       The Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP) is a multi-objective project&#13;
that will generate substantial economic benefits particularly over the longer-term. The economic&#13;
analysis focuses on quantifying the impact of two components of the project:&#13;
(i)       the Scheme Completion Component (SCC) in which the construction of 8&#13;
ongoing irrigation schemes (subprojects) would be completed;&#13;
(ii)      the System Improvement and Farmer Turnover Component (SIFT) which&#13;
will rehabilitate and modernise 19 existing irrigation schemes.&#13;
Additional to rehabilitating and modemising 19 subprojects the SIFT component includes an&#13;
Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) sub-component designed to improve O&amp;M and cost recovery&#13;
procedures in the Department of Water Resources (DOWR), as well as a Fanmer Organisation and&#13;
Turnover (FOT) sub-component. Under SIFT O&amp;M below minors or distributaries will be&#13;
progressively turned-over to farmers through the formation of Water User Associations (WUAs).&#13;
2.       The economic analysis focuses on quantifying the inpact of the SCC and SIFT activities on&#13;
irrigation and agricultural production. Other benefits such as reduced flood damage and saved&#13;
maintenance costs are quantified where appropriate. The project will lead to significant other benefits,&#13;
which due to a lack of available data have not been quantified. Non-quantified benefits are nevertheless&#13;
considerable and they are described briefly. The economic analysis is presented in two parts, viz. the&#13;
economic analysis of the scheme completions component (SCC) and a separate analysis of the SIFT&#13;
component. In each part, the analyses of subprojects are briefly described, as well as a component&#13;
analysis which is an aggregate analysis based on the individual subproject analyses. In the case of the&#13;
SCC component, all 8 subprojects are analysed in detail. The economic analysis of the SIFT&#13;
component is based on a detailed analysis of the 5 major schemes included in the project, as well as two&#13;
representative medium schemes (one diversion type of scheme and one storage scherne).&#13;
3.       A final section of this annex deals with the financial impact of the SCC and SIFT&#13;
components on farmer incomes. Again this section is divided into two parts, the first part dealing with&#13;
the SCC component and the second the SIFT component.&#13;

B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Overview&#13;
4.        The economic analysis of the SCC and SIFT components of the Orissa WRCP focuses on&#13;
quantifying the impact of project activities on irrigation and agricultural production, although other&#13;
important benefits have been quantified which include reduced flood damage, improved drainage,&#13;
saved construction and maintenance costs, and canal safety benefits.&#13;
5.        Besides the quantified benefits, the project would generate other benefits which are difficult&#13;
to quantify. Transforming the Orissa Department of Water Resources (DOWR), previously refeffed to&#13;
as the Orissa Irrigation Department, from a construction oriented organisation to a water resources&#13;
agency would improve the planning and management of the state's water resources. Water would be&#13;
more efficiently utilised and environmental sustainability enhanced. The use of surface and&#13;
groundwater resources, and the allocation of water between competing users, would be rationalised&#13;
through improved planning and more efficient water pricing policies. Bulk water supplies for industrial&#13;
and domestic users would be assured through improved operation and maintenance of the water&#13;
delivery system. Lack of quantitative data eliminates the explicit inclusion of these benefits in the&#13;
economic analysis; the magnitude of these benefits would substantially increase over the longer-term.&#13;
6.        The annual availability of surface water resources has been assessed at 70,000 million cubic&#13;
metres and that of ground water at 19,000 million cubic metres". Although State policy is to give first&#13;
priority for domestic use, and thereafter for irrigation, other uses of water, which include hydropower&#13;
generation, industrial use, and to meet environmental objectives such as salinity control and fish&#13;
production, coppete with the agriculture sector. Furthermore, the demand for water by all users will&#13;
continue to incitase.&#13;
7.       Irrigation accounts for more than 95% of the surface water used in the state. The second&#13;
most important user of water is the industrial sector which is reported to consume about 350 million&#13;
cubic metres per year. Industrial and domestic users consume about 3% of all surface water.&#13;
Government of Orissa (GOO) have recently proposed increasing water charges for industrial purposes&#13;
to Rs. 0.4 per cubic metre, a rate considerably in excess of the rates applied to farmers (which vary by&#13;
type of crop). New water rates have recently been proposed in Orissa. According to GOO, revenue&#13;
from the industrial users will increase to Rs. 146 million annually, whereas revenue collected from&#13;
farmers at present totals only Rs. 50 million. As part of its policy reform program (Annex 1) DOWR&#13;
has proposed an increase in water rates charged to farmners, to be phased over the five-year period to&#13;
the year 2000. The expected increase in water rates has been incorporated in the analysis by use of&#13;
water rate that is double the current rate.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
8.        Irrigation Benefits. Project activities will significantly increase the supply of surface water&#13;
in Orissa. The economic benefits of increasing surface water could theoretically be calculated on the&#13;
" Irrigation in Orissa, Water &amp; Land Management Institute, Cuttack, Orissa, 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 19&#13;

basis of water prices of the competing domestic, agricultural and industrial users. However, water&#13;
prices in Orissa do not reflect efficiency prices for water (refer para. 7). Since most of the increased&#13;
water made available through the project will be used for agriculture, it is considered to be most&#13;
realistic to value the increase in water supplies in terms of the marginal increases in agricultural&#13;
production. A further justification of valuing the benefits of the project in termis of increased&#13;
agricultural output is that generally agriculture is the least economically attractive alternative water use,&#13;
so that the benefits of the project are under- estimated rather than over-estimated.&#13;
9.        In the case of the SCC it is assumed that irrigation water will enable farmers to irrigate&#13;
previously rainfed crops (in the case of kharif) and to introduce new crops in the rabi. Future with and&#13;
without project cropping pattems2' are based in part on existing cropping pattems, availability of&#13;
irrigation water, farmer preferences, profitability of altemative crops and the availability of markets (see&#13;
paras. 17-19). It is assumed that farmers will modify their cropping pattems and agronomic practices&#13;
over a period of years. In general it has been assumed that cropping pattems and irrigation practices&#13;
will be progressively adopted over an eight-year period, which is considered to be a realistic time&#13;
frame.&#13;
10.       In the economic analysis of the SIFT component, irrigation benefits have been valued based&#13;
on the assumption that areas currently receiving inadequate irrigation water (generally the middle&#13;
reaches of irrigation canals) will be fully irrigated following scheme rehabilitation and modernisation.&#13;
Areas presently unirrigated (generally the tail-ends of canals) will be either fully irrigated or partially&#13;
irrigated after the project depending on the availability of water. It is further assumed that the upper&#13;
reaches of canals which are fully irrigated at present will continue to be fully irrigated following project&#13;
completion. Some changes in future cropping pattems have been incorporated in the economic&#13;
analysis of the SIFT component. Changes have been made particularly in the rabi season, where it is&#13;
considered that present cropping practices inefficiently utilise the scarce water available. Such changes&#13;
to the cropping pattern would also be desirable in order to achieve the project's objective of equitable&#13;
sharing of water throughout the CCA. In these situations cropping pattems are based on the amount of&#13;
water available, farmer preferences for growing particular crops and the availability of markets.&#13;
11        Irrigation benefits are quantified by calculating crop budgets under full irrigation, partial&#13;
irrigation and rainfed conditions, for each irrigation subproject analysed. Yield estimates are based on&#13;
field data obtained through rapid rural surveys at subproject locations and cutting trial data held by the&#13;
local Agriculture Department staff. In the case of the SCC subprojects where, in general, only rainfed&#13;
famning is currently practised, crop yields under irrigated conditions have been based on those yields&#13;
achieved in irrigated areas as close as possible to the scheme sites. It is considered that such an analysis&#13;
would result in realistic estimations of rates of economic return and would prevent over-estimation of&#13;
project benefits. Detailed crop budgets showing the yield and input assumptions used in the analysis of&#13;
the SCC component and the SIFT component have been prepared.&#13;
12.       Of the 8 subprojects included in the SCC component, FAOCP missions visited 7 and&#13;
prepared detailed economic analyses of 4'. The remaining 3 subprojects were analysed by DOWR&#13;
2/ The cropping patterns used in the economic analysis have been taken from the respective DOWR/FAOCP subproject reports.&#13;
v See FAOCP Reports 164/92 CP-IND 95 WPs dated I December 1992, Report 76/93 CP-IND 98 WPs dated 14 May 1993,&#13;

following the FAOCP methodology. All analyses were updated in terms of prices by FAOCP based on&#13;
DOWR detailed project reports prepared in November 1994'.&#13;
13.       FAOCP prepared detailed economic analyses of 2 subprojects included of the SIFr&#13;
component' and prepared economic analysis guidelinese. DOWR prepared economic analyses of 5&#13;
other subprojects following the FAOCP methodology and guidelines. Prices have been revised to&#13;
January 1995 prices for the purpose of the preparation of this Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
14.       Irrigation benefits, as well as the other benefits that have been quantified for the economic&#13;
analysis, are described separately under each subproject.&#13;
15.       Project Costs, Physical Contingency, Foreign Exchange and Tax Rates. Financial&#13;
base costs for each subproject of the SCC and SIFT components are given in Annex 18. Costs are&#13;
expressed in constant January 1995 prices net of identifiable taxes. Physical contingencies are 15% for&#13;
civil works, and 10%/ for equipment and vehicles. Foreign exchange and local taxes for each cost are&#13;
identified in the cost tables Annex 18. Foreign exchange component for expenditure items range from&#13;
zero to 30 percent. Tax rates are based on local taxes applicable in Orissa and have been applied at a&#13;
rate of 8% for civil works, 12% for equipment and materials, 100/o for vehicles, and zero for other&#13;
expenditures. Economic costs have been estimated by multiplying the financial base costs plus physical&#13;
contingencies by the India standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9.&#13;
16.       Period of Analysis, Base Prices and Sunk Costs. The econornic imnpacts of the&#13;
subprojects are analysed over 30 years. Costs of construction were estimated by DOWR in&#13;
accordance with their 1995 schedule of rates. Prices used are all expressed in January 1995 constant&#13;
rupees. For all of the subprojects, any costs that have been incurred prior to 1 January 1995 are treated&#13;
as sunk costs and have been ignored for the purpose of the economic analysis.&#13;
17.       Marketing of Incremental Production. Agricultural production at present and estimated&#13;
following ful development for the SCC and SIFT components have been assessed. Considering the&#13;
two components jointly, incremental production is calculated at approximately 207,600 tonnes of&#13;
paddy, 5,200 tonnes of other cereals, 12,000 tonnes of pulses, 74,700 tonnes of oilseeds, 266,200&#13;
tonnes of sugarcane, other crops (chilli and jute) 4,800 tonnes, 86,700 tonnes of potatoes and 158,600&#13;
tonnes of vegetables. Total crop production in Orissa in 1988/89,7' and incremental project&#13;
production, are tabulated below. Average annual incremental project production is a mere one percent&#13;
for the total market.&#13;

18.       The average annual increase in project production over current production ranges from 1%&#13;
to 90/o for individual crops. Incremental agricultural output for the SCC and SlFr components is&#13;
negligible for rice, other cereals, pulses, and vegetables other than potatoes. Incremental output of&#13;
these crops will be readily absorbed in markets in Orissa and will substitute for imports from&#13;
neighbouring states. The increase in oilseeds production is also minimal. It is expected readily&#13;
absorbable by the market also in that production has been expanding rapidly and GOO have been&#13;
subsidising the price of groundnut in a drive to replace imported vegetable oil. The production of&#13;
sugarcane in Onssa has also been expanding rapidly in recent years. The expected 9% average annual&#13;
production is thus not excessive. The additional sugar production will be absorbed by sugar factories&#13;
in subproject locations, which have expressed their desire to expand output.&#13;
19.       Incremental potato production for the project is calculated at 87,000 tonnes, representing&#13;
an average annual increase of 9%. Though this appears high, there is no expectation of difficulty of&#13;
absorption in fresh markets adjoining project locations, in other markets in Orissa, or in adjoining&#13;
states. The average annual increase of potato production has been 91 percent during the same period,8'&#13;
and the recent trend in production of vegetables has been following an upward trend in recent years&#13;
(with average annual increase of 17 percent between 1988/89 and 1990/91). Potato production has&#13;
been expanding rapidly mainly in response to GOO program of building storage facilities in strategic&#13;
locations throughout the State.&#13;
Economic Prices and Costs&#13;
20.       Economic import and export parity prices are calculated based on the World Bank&#13;
Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets dated February 1995 (see Table I at Attachment 1). World&#13;
market prices for intemationally traded conmmodities are based on price projections for the year 2000 in&#13;
constant year end 1995 dollars. Farmgate equivalent import parity prices have been calculated for rice,&#13;
groundnuts, wheat, maize, urea, phosphate and potash. India is approaching self-sufficiency in nice,&#13;
l' Annual production was 98,900, 250,000 and 360,000 in 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91, respectively.&#13;
&#13;

oilseeds and wheat. However, India's high rate of population growth (2.2% per year), as well as the&#13;
relatively high income elasticity of demand for rice, other cereals and oilseeds, justifies considering&#13;
these commodities as import substitutes. Orissa is a net importer of rice and other cereals so that&#13;
intemal transport and handling costs have been added in calculating their import parity prices. Sugar is&#13;
considered to be an export conmmodity and an export parity price has been calculated.&#13;
21.       All other commodities have been considered as not traded on the international market.&#13;
Their financial prices have been adjusted to economic prices using a SCF of 0.9. In all cases average&#13;
farmgate prices have been used, based on informnation collected from rapid rural appraisal surveys, as&#13;
well as market data obtained from the Orissa Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department.&#13;
22.       The economic prices of fertilisers have been calculated based on the import parity prices of&#13;
urea, super phosphate and muriate of potash (refer Table 1 at Attachment I). The economic prices of&#13;
all other farm inputs are 1994 financial prices ruling at each subproject location adjusted by the SCF of&#13;
0.9.&#13;
23.       Labour Market and Wages. Orissa is a rural labour surplus state characterised by&#13;
significant underemployment particularly in the dry season of each year, or unemployed for more than&#13;
6 months of the year. Every year migrant labour moves to other states in India, for a period ranging&#13;
from 3 to 6 months from November to July of the following year. According to the State Labour&#13;
Institute of Orissa (SLI)9' the system of migrant "dadan" labour is well established in Orissa where rural&#13;
laborers, who are highly sought after in other states throughout India, are hired through agents and&#13;
work on a variety of agriculture and construction activities. Various socio-econornic surveys at the&#13;
district level have been carried out and SLI estimates that between 300,000 and 400,000 rural workers&#13;
migrate out of Orissa temporarily each year. These migrant workers normally return to Orissa before&#13;
the monsoon season when they find employment in the rural sector or tend to their own crops. This&#13;
represents about 3% of the total working population of 11.8 million in Orissa. Although the minimum&#13;
wage for agricultural labourers has been set since 1954, having been at Rs. 25/day since July 1990, in&#13;
practice actual wages paid vary throughout the State depending on the supply and demand for labour.&#13;
For example, rural wages vary at the various locations of the OWRCP sub-projects from Rs. 17/day to&#13;
Rs. 23/day for an 8 hour work day.&#13;
24.       There has been no detailed study carried out in Orissa of the shadow price of rural labour.&#13;
For this economic analysis the shadow price of farm labour has been estimated by multiplying the&#13;
financial rate ruling at each subproject site by the SCF of 0.9.&#13;
Scheme Completion Component (SCC)&#13;
Summary Results of SCC Economic Analysis&#13;
25.       The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the SCC component is based on the following&#13;
assumptions: (i) all costs and benefits are in constant November 1995 prices; (ii) project benefits and&#13;
costs are calculated for 30 years; (iii) each year of analysis is assumed to coincide with the India&#13;
financial year; (iv) quantifiable benefits for 6 of the subprojects (all with the exception of Naraj&#13;

include flood prevention, savings in construction costs as well as incremental production from&#13;
irrigation; (vi) investment costs incurred before 1 January 1995 have been considered sunk costs and&#13;
have been ignored; (vii) O&amp;M costs would be Rs. 524/ha of the CCA (in financial prices); (viii)&#13;
project implementation would be over a seven-year period; (ix) the opportunity cost of capital is 12%.&#13;
26.         The economic cash flow is presented in Table 2 at Attachment I. The overall ERR for the&#13;
SCC component is estimated to be 22% and the Net Present Value (NPV) at 12% is Rs. 2,114 million&#13;
in January 1995 prices. The Hariharjore subproject generates the highest net benefits following fill&#13;
development (270/o of total net benefits) followed by the Naraj subproject (24%) and Badanalla (23%).&#13;
SCC Sensitivity Analysis&#13;

30.        Benefits. Quantified benefits are the incremental agricultural production calculated for the&#13;
project for a CCA of 8,483 hectares. Water delivery is phased over three years. It is assumed that&#13;
farmers would filly adopt irrigated farming practices over a five-year time frame. Crop budgets used&#13;
in the analysis, the assumed cropping patterns, crop yields and production with and without the project&#13;
are as per DOWR Project Report dated November 1994. Full development is reached in year 11 when&#13;
the economic value of the annual incremental agricultural output is calculated at Rs. 187 million.&#13;
31.        Costs. Investment costs in financial and economic prices are set out in Annex 18. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR (Project Report dated Novernber 1994). The cost of dam&#13;
safety works (to be carried out as part of the Dam Safety Project) has been included in the analysis.&#13;
Total investment cost in financial prices applying an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$ is US$4368/ha.&#13;

36.         Benefits. Quantified benefits are the incremental agricultural production calculated for the&#13;
project for a CCA of 15,432 hectares. Water delivery is phased over three years. It is assumed that&#13;
farmers would fully adopt irrigated farming practices over an eight-year time frame. Crop budgets&#13;
used in the analysis, the assumed cropping patterns, crop yields and production with and without the&#13;
project are as per DOWR Project Report dated November 1994. Full development is reached in year&#13;
11 when the economic value of the annual incremental agricultural output is calculated at Rs. 227&#13;
million.&#13;
37.         Costs. Investment costs in financial and economic prices are set out in Annex 18. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR (Project Report dated May 1995). A total of 408.3&#13;
hectares would be needed for construction of canals. The lost production from this land has been&#13;
included as a cost. O&amp;M has been valued at Rs. 524/ha (financial prices and adjusted to economic&#13;
costs by applying the SCF of 0.9).&#13;

Naraj Barrage Subproject&#13;
41.       The benefit and cost streams of the Naraj Barrage are presented in Table 3 at Attachment&#13;
1.&#13;
42.      Benefits. The existing condition of tlie Naraj weir can be described as precarious. Should&#13;
the weir ffil catastrophic flood damage would occur downstream in the Puri district and irrigation&#13;
would be curtailed for probably five years before a replacement weir could be constructed. Three types&#13;
of benefits were quantified.&#13;
43.      (a) Irrigation benefits. Should the weir fail it is assumed that an area of 206,000 hectares&#13;
would not receive any irrigation during a five-year period. It is further assumed that the weir would fail&#13;
in year 10. The net economic loss of imrgation is valued at Rs. 805 million based on existing cropping&#13;
patterns and farmer practices, as well as a likely cropping pattern should the weir fail.&#13;
44.      (b) Reduced flood damage. At present considerable flooding occurs every year in the Puri&#13;
district (Stage II area) which would be reduced following construction of the barrage. Flood benefits&#13;
are estimated at about Rs. 106 million annually.&#13;
45.      (c) Cost Savings. By constructing a new barrage now, rebuilding the weir after the&#13;
existing weir failed would not be necessary. The cost of this is treated as a benefit.&#13;
46.      Costs. Investment costs in financial and economic prices are set out in Annex 18. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR (Project Report dated November 1994). O&amp;M has been&#13;
valued at 10% of the investment costs.&#13;
47.      Results. The ERR of the Naraj Barrage subproject is estimated to be 24% and the NPV at&#13;
12% Rs. 750 million.&#13;
48.       Sensitivity Analysis. A number of scenarios were tested to establish the economic viability&#13;

Badanalla Subproject&#13;
51.        The benefit and cost streams of the Badanalla subproject are presented in Table 3 at&#13;
Attachment I.&#13;
52.         Benefits. Quantified benefits are the incremental agricultural production calculated for the&#13;
project for a CCA of 8,650 hectares. Although 2,000 hectares could now be partially irrigated under&#13;
the works already completed, for the purpose of the economic analysis it is assumed that 1,000&#13;
hectares could be fully irrigated in the kharif. Water delivery for full irrigation is phased over four&#13;
years. It is assumed that farmers would modify their farming system from rainfed to irrigated a eight-&#13;
year time frame. Crop budgets used in the analysis, the assumed cropping pattems, crop yields and&#13;
production with and without the project are as per DOWR Project Report dated November 1994. Full&#13;
development is calculated to be reached in year 12 when the economic value of the annual incremental&#13;
agricultural output, net of the 1,000 hectares assumed to be irrigated in kharif plus the land lost to&#13;
canals (342 ha) is calculated at Rs. 139 million.&#13;
53.         Costs. Investment costs in financial and economic prices are set out in Annex 18. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR (Project Report dated November 1994). Total investment&#13;
costs in financial prices applying an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$ is US$1542/ha.&#13;

Baghua Subproject&#13;
75.      The benefit and cost streams of the Baghua subproject are presented in Table 3 at&#13;
Attu chment 1.&#13;
76.      Benefits. Quantified benefits are the incremental agricultural production calculated for the&#13;
project for a CCA of 6,240 hectares Stage I and Stage I areas of 3,000 ha and 3,240 ha respectively).&#13;
Water delivery for full irrigation is phased over three years. It is assumed that farmers would switch to&#13;
fully irrigated practices over an eight-year time frame. Crop budgets used in the analysis, the assumed&#13;
cropping pattems, crop yields and production with and without the project are as per DOWR Project&#13;
Report dated November 1994. Full development is calculated to be reached in year 12 when the&#13;
economic value of the incremental annual agricultural output is calculated at Rs. 58 million.&#13;
77.      Costs. Investment costs in financial and economic prices are set out in Annex 18. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR (Project Report dated November 1994). Included as a cost&#13;
is the value of agricultural production forgone from land still required for the reservoir and construction&#13;
of canals (664 ha phased over three years). Total investment cost to be incurred from 1 January 1995&#13;
in financial terms applying an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$ is US$1745/ha.&#13;

System Improvement and Farmer Turnover Component (SIFT)&#13;
Summary Results of SIFT Economic Analysis&#13;
81.        The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the SIFT component is based on the following&#13;
assumptions: (i) all costs and benefits are in constant January 1995 prices; (ii) project benefits and&#13;
costs are calculated for thirty years; (iii) quantifiable benefits include increased agricultural production&#13;
from improved irrigation water supply, preventing further decline in scheme performance which is&#13;
assumed to continue in the without project situation, savings in maintenance costs, reduced flooding&#13;
and canal safety; (iv) all major subprojects are included in the analysis and two medium subprojects&#13;
which are considered representative of diversion and storage type schemes'"; (v) O&amp;M costs without&#13;
project are taken at 1994/95 levels and with project at Rs. 524/ha of the CCA (in financial prices); (vi)&#13;
project implementation would be over a seven-year period; and (vii) opportunity cost of capital is&#13;
12%.&#13;
82.        Physical contingencies of 15% have been added to base investment costs for the economic&#13;
analysis. Economic costs have been estimated by multiplying financial costs by the SCF of 0.9. Costs&#13;
have been phased according to the DOWR. Project investmnent costs include a provision of Rs.&#13;
0' In the economic analysis of the SIFT component the two medium schemes are weighted in relation to their CCAs and the&#13;
total CCAs of the medium diversion and storage schemes included in the SIFT component.&#13;

Page 19of31&#13;
87.       Benefits. At present less than 30°/o of the CCA of 18,500 hectares is fully irrigated. The&#13;
remaining area is partially irrigated where the delivery of water cannot be guaranteed. Three types of&#13;
benefits have been quantified: (i) incremental agricultural production; (ii) reduced agricultural&#13;
production without the project; and (iii) saved O&amp;M costs. In economic terms the most important&#13;
benefit is the increased agricultural production that would be realised from the areas partially irrigated&#13;
at present. It is assumed that these areas will be fully irrigated following rehabilitation and&#13;
modernisation. The second benefit quantified is due to the fact that the scheme has been slowly&#13;
deteriorating over time due to insufficient O&amp;M funding and inadequate water management practices.&#13;
It has been conservatively assumed that in the absence of the project (i.e. in the future without project&#13;
situation) agricultural production will fall 0.5% per year. This gradual drop in production has been&#13;
treated as a benefit to the project assuming that this decline would be arrested as a result of the project.&#13;
Agricultural production benefits are phased in over four years from year 4 to year 7, assuming an&#13;
increase of 25% per year. Production benefits are based on the cropping patterns and crop yields&#13;
supplied by DOWR. Detailed crop budgets used in the analysis were prepared. O&amp;M costs incurred&#13;
on the scheme in 1994 of Rs. 382/ha (adjusted to economic values by the SCF of 0.9) are considered&#13;
to be a saved cost since the O&amp;M costs following project completion has been entered as a cost.&#13;
88.       Costs. Economic investment costs (refer para. 82) are phased over seven years and include&#13;
Group A and Group B works"'. In financial prices, the non-discounted investment cost is US$348/ha&#13;
using an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$.&#13;
Results. The ERR of the Kendrapara subproject is estimated to be 24% and the NPV at&#13;
12% Rs. 143 million.&#13;
89.       Sensitivity Analysis. A number of scenarios were tested to establish the economic viability&#13;
of the subproject. Results are tabulated below.&#13;
Group A works include all works necessary for irrigation purposes. Group B works include expenditure on roads and&#13;
bridges which would facilitate operation and maintenance of the scheme but would also generate social benefits to farmers.&#13;

Sakhigopal Subproject&#13;
91.       The benefit and cost streams of the Sakhigopal subproject are presented in Table 4 at&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
92.       Benefits. The present irrigation system is not capable of delivering water on a timely and&#13;
controlled basis throughout the command. Less than half of the CCA (CCA = 28,200 hectares)&#13;
receives water regularly during the kharif and no rabi irrigation is practised. The remaining area may&#13;
only receive water if crop failure is imminent and has been treated in the economic analysis as being&#13;
rainfed. Five types of benefits have been quantified: (i) increased agricultural production; (ii) reduced&#13;
expenditure on repairing canal breaches; (iii) reduced crop flood damage from canal breaches; (iv)&#13;
halting the continual degradation of the scheme due to which it is assumed agricultural production&#13;
would continue to fall 0.5% per year; and (v) savings of the O&amp;M costs which would be incurred in&#13;
the without project situation. In economic terms the most important benefit is the incremental&#13;
agricultural production which is phased in over three years from year 4 to year 6, assuming an increase&#13;
of 33% per year. Production benefits are based on the cropping pattems and crop yields supplied by&#13;
DOWR. Detailed crop budgets used in the analysis were prepared. O&amp;M costs incurred on the&#13;
scheme in 1994 of Rs. 28 1/ha (adjusted to economic values by the SCF of 0.9) are considered to be a&#13;
saved cost since the O&amp;M costs following project completion has been entered as a cost.&#13;

Rushikulya Subproject&#13;
97.        The benefit and cost streams of the Rushikulya subproject are presented in Table 4 at&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
98.        Benefits. The present irrigation system is not capable of delivering water on a timely and&#13;
controlled basis throughout the command. Sixty four percent of the CCA (CCA = 21,480 ha) receives&#13;
adequate irrigation in kharif while 24% is partially irrigated and the remaining area does not receive any&#13;
irrigation water. No rabi irrigation is practised. With the project it is assumed that more than 800/o of&#13;
the CCA would be filly irrigated in kharif and the remaining area would be partially irrigated. In the&#13;
analysis it is also assumed that a small area (less than 100/o of the CCA) would be partially irrigated in&#13;
rabi. Three types of benefits have been quantified: (i) increased agricultural production; (ii) halting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 19&#13;
Page 22 of 31&#13;
continual degradation of the scheme due to which it is assumed agricultural production would continue&#13;
to fall 0.5% per year; and (iii) savings of the O&amp;M costs which would be incurred in the without&#13;
project situation. In economic terms the most important benefit is the incremental agricultural&#13;
production which is phased in over four years from year 4 to year 7, assuming an increase of 25% per&#13;
year. Production benefits are based on the cropping patterns and crop yields supplied by DOWR.&#13;
Detailed crop budgets used in the analysis were prepared. O&amp;M costs incurred on the scheme in 1994&#13;
of Rs. 382/ha (adjusted to economic values by the SCF of 0.9) are considered to be a saved cost since&#13;
the O&amp;M costs following project completion has been entered as a cost.&#13;
99.       Costs. Economic investment costs (refer para. 82) are phased over seven years and include&#13;
Group A and Group B works. In financial prices, the non-discounted investment cost is US$550/ha&#13;
using an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$.&#13;

103.     The benefit and cost streams of the Baitarani subproject are presented in Table 4 at&#13;
Attachment 1.&#13;
104.     Benefits. The present irrigation system does not deliver water on a timely and controlled&#13;
basis throughout the command. Only 300/o of the CCA (CCA = 19,700 ha) receives adequate&#13;
irrigation in kharif while the remainder of the command is partially irrigated. No rabi irrigation is&#13;
practised. With the project it is assumed that 75% of the CCA would be fully irrigated in kharif and the&#13;
remainder would be partially irrigated. In the analysis it is also assumed that rabi irrigation of low&#13;
water demanding crops could be achieved over 32% of the command. Three types of benefits have&#13;
been quantified: (i) increased agricultural production; (ii) halting the continual degradation of the&#13;
scheme due to which it is assumed agricultural production would continue to fall 0.5% per year; and&#13;
(iii) savings of the O&amp;M costs which would be incurred in the without project situation. In economic&#13;
terms the most important benefit is the incremental agricultural production which is phased in over four&#13;

122.      Benefits. The present irrigation system is not capable of delivering water on a timely and&#13;
controlled basis throughout the command. Less than half of the CCA (CCA = 7,203 hectares) receives&#13;
water regularly during the kharif and no rabi irrigation is practised. The remaining area is inadequately&#13;
irrigated. Five types of benefits have been quantified: (i) increased agricultural production; (ii) reduced&#13;
expenditure on repairing canals; (iii) improved canal safety; (iv) halting the continual degradation of&#13;
the scheme due to which it is assumed agricultural production would continue to fall 0.5% per year;&#13;
and (v) savings of the O&amp;M costs which would be incurred in the without project situation. In&#13;
economic terms the most important benefit is the canal safety benefit. The present state of repair of the&#13;
main aqueduct and a number of siphons is extremely poor the possibility of failure is high. Should the&#13;
aqueduct fail irrigation would be disrupted on almost 5,600 hectares. The probability of failure is&#13;
estimated at 5%. Incremental agricultural production is phased in over four years from year 2 to year&#13;
5, assuming an increase of 25% per year. Production benefits are based on the cropping patterns and&#13;
crop yields supplied by DOWR. Detailed crop budgets used in the analysis were prepared. O&amp;M&#13;
costs incurred on the scheme in 1994 of Rs. 382/ha (adjusted to economic values by the SCF of 0.9)&#13;
are considered to be a saved cost since the O&amp;M costs following project completion has been entered&#13;
as a cost.&#13;
123.      Costs. Economic investment costs (refer para. 82) are phased over six years and include&#13;
Group A and Group B works. In financial prices, the non-discounted investment cost is US$212/ha&#13;
using an exchange rate of Rs. 32.0/US$.&#13;
124.      Results. The ERR of the Ghodahada subproject is estimated to be 290/o and the NPV at&#13;
12% Rs. 32.7 million.&#13;

C. PROJECT IMPACT ON FARMER INCOMES&#13;
Overview&#13;
127.     In this section the financial impact of the project for farmers is analysed. Crop incomes,&#13;
inclusive of the value of crop residues, at present and following full development are quantified for&#13;
typical farms (i.e., model farms). One model farm for each subproject is analysed. The ratio of&#13;
incremental returns to additional resources (i.e. costs) are calculated for each model farm in order to&#13;
gauge the financial attractiveness of the project for typical farmers. Increases in retums to family&#13;
labour are also calculated for the Scheme Completion Component (SCC) subprojects where a detailed&#13;
analysis of labour (family as well as hired) has been carried out.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
128.     The analysis is based on the crop budgets prepared for each of the subprojects analysed.&#13;
One farm model was prepared for each subproject. Farm models range in size from 1.13 ha to 2.07 ha&#13;
for the SCC subprojects. Since data on the number of farms within each command are not readily&#13;
available for the SIFT component, farm models for these subprojects are assumed to be of 1 hectare.&#13;
The areas of crops specified for each farm model for the without project situation are based on the&#13;
existing cropping patterns, which are assumed to be maintained in the future without project situation.&#13;
Crop areas specified for the future with project situation are based on the assumed cropping patterns&#13;
following fiull development.&#13;
129.      Farm crop incomes have been calculated for the farm models specified for each subproject&#13;
for both the without project and with project situations. Total crop production is valued at prevailing&#13;
farmgate prices (see para. 127) regardless of whether the product is consumed on the farm or sold.&#13;
Similarly all crop residues are valued at farmgate prices, although commonly they are consumed on the&#13;
farms on which they are produced normally being fed to livestock. A market for crop residues exists at&#13;
all subproject sites. The analysis does not include farm income derived from other farm activities such&#13;
as from livestock or the sale of family labour, nor does it include other income derived from any off-&#13;
farm activities. Nevertheless the analysis does provide a measure of the increases in net farm income&#13;
on typical farm holdings attributable to the project.&#13;
130.      A key concern for farmers is the extra return they can expect to get from committing more&#13;
resources following irrigation (SCC subprojects) or from improved irrigation (SIFT subprojects). The&#13;
ratios calculated of incremental farm crop income to additional costs provides a measure of the&#13;
financial attractiveness of the project to farmers.&#13;
131.      Of major concem to small farmers is the return they obtain from the work they do on their&#13;
farms. Following irrigation, the opportunity arises for farm families to increase their labour input,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 363 -&#13;
Annex 19&#13;
Page 29 of 31&#13;
particularly during the rabi season, by being able to crop more intensively by switching to higher valued&#13;
more labour demanding crops, and by cropping land that usually remains fallow under rainfed&#13;
conditions. Hence a detailed analysis was canied out of the labour requirements for each crop for all of&#13;
the SCC subprojects, since the introduction of irrigation into largely rainfed areas has a major impact&#13;
on labour '2'&#13;
Financial Prices&#13;
132.       Prevailing farmgate input and output prices were used in the preparation of the financial&#13;
evaluation of crop budgets and the farm models. The prices were derived from interviews with&#13;
farmers, and from wholesale and retail market price data adjusted for transport costs and traders'&#13;
margins. Care was taken to establish "normal" prices for products which exhibit widely fluctuating&#13;
year-to-year or seasonal prices, such as fresh vegetables, so as to reflect "average" prices during the&#13;
peak production periods. Prices have in general been adjusted to constant 1994 price levels. Financial&#13;
prices were derived for each subproject analysed.&#13;

Farm Crop Incomes&#13;
133.       Farm crop net incomes are tabulated below for the model farms of 6 of the SCC&#13;
subprojects for the future without project and future with project (following full developmnent)&#13;
situations. Net crop income is total farm crop income net of all costs excluding family labour.&#13;

134.       Farm crop incomes are estimated to rise substantially following foil development.&#13;
Increases range from more than double (in excess of 170%) to over 6000/o. On average farm crop&#13;
incomes are estimated to increase about 450%/o.&#13;

136.      The ratio of incremental returns to additional costs calculated range from 3.08 to 6.00 and&#13;
average 4.39. This indicates that the project would in general be highly financiafly attractive to farmers.&#13;
It can therefore be expected that farmers would adapt their farming practices from rainfed to irrigated&#13;
systems, and adopt the level of technology assumed in the crop budgets and farm model analysis.&#13;
137.      As a further measure of the financial impact of the project to farmers, the returns to family&#13;
labour calculated for the without project and with project situations by subproject are sumnmrised next.&#13;

138.      Retums to family labour are estimated to range from Rs. 19 to Rs. 71 per man-day in the&#13;
without project situation (average Rs. 45/man-day) and from Rs. 86 to Rs. 155 in the with project&#13;
situation (average Rs. I 1 3/man-day). Calculations indicate that the returns to family labour would on&#13;
average more than double following full development, confirming the financial attractiveness of the&#13;
project to farmers. These estimated returns to family labour can be compared to the minimum daily&#13;
wage for unskilled rural labour in Orissa of Rs. 25/man-day.&#13;

can therefore be anticipated that farmers would adapt their famiing practices as anticipated in the&#13;
analysis when more irrigation water is made available.&#13;

ORISSA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Expenditure Prioritization&#13;
I.    Implementation of the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (OWRCP) is linked&#13;
with the fundamental policy framework for public expenditure in the state's water resources&#13;
sector. The Orissa State Water Policy (1994) and the guidelines of the Planning Commission, as&#13;
well as concepts contained in the water sector literature,' form the basis for Orissa's new&#13;
investment policy. The new expenditure program must recognize the heritage of the past where&#13;
expenditures were spread too thinly over a wide array of construction sites to the detriment of&#13;
speedy completions. This heritage of ongoing sites will partly influence expenditure patterns in&#13;
the future, but within these constraints Government of Orissa (GOO) has decided upon a major&#13;
change in focus. DOWR expenditures will now emphasize intensified use and sustainability of&#13;
existing irrigation systems as well as upgrading the capabilities of the Department. Maintenance&#13;
works will henceforth be fully funded to required levels, a situation already achieved for the&#13;
1994/95 season. Expenditures on construction will be more sharply focused to emphasize,&#13;
particularly in the medium term, the completion of ongoing projects. To meet the new challenges,&#13;
Government of Orissa proposes to allocate its public expenditure budget in the following order of&#13;
priority:&#13;
(i)   Institutional strengthening activities supporting the reorganization of the&#13;
department including improving technical capabilities through training and&#13;
technical assistance;&#13;
(ii)   Adequate funding for operation and maintenance of existing facilities;&#13;
(iii) Improving existing systems including the farmer turn-over program-;&#13;
(iv)   Completion of ongoing viable projects; and&#13;
(v)   Continuing in a lirnited way project construction where infrastructure facilities and&#13;
basic construction facilities have been taken up.&#13;
2.    Priorities (i) to (iii) would have first call on state expenditures, and their fundarnental&#13;
nature would demand full funding under any reasonable scenario of the state's financial situation.&#13;
They are considered top needs, and funding to full required levels would be assured. Priority (ii)&#13;
has already been achieved by GOO, and priorities (i) and (iii) are to be given full funding with&#13;
Bank financial assistance under the OWRCP.&#13;
3.    Investments under (iv) and (v) comprise the area where difficult prioritization decisions&#13;
are required. The large water development potential of Orissa state and sizable backlog of&#13;
1 India Irrigation Sector Review (World Bank/GOI, 1991); Water Resources Management (World Bank, 1993);&#13;
Eighth Plan (GOI, 1985).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 372 -&#13;
Annex 21&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
ongoing projects must face up to budgetary limitations for the overall program and the need to&#13;
assure that all investments are well prepared and implemented according to acceptable&#13;
engineering, economic, environmental and social criteria, and in the context of the state's overall&#13;
basin and state water planning.&#13;
4.    Criteria to be used in preparing and evaluating individual investments are described at&#13;
Annex 15 of the OWRCP Appraisal Report. Use of these criteria will themselves provide a&#13;
valuable tool to screen investment candidates so as to identify potentially viable investments and&#13;
to reject candidates that do not fulfill the criteria due, for instance, to water availability&#13;
constraints, low economic viability, environmental concerns, etc. (refer Annex 15).&#13;
5.    The state's water planning activities (Annex 5) will also become a key guide for&#13;
investment decisions as multi-sectoral basin plans are refined and the state water plan is&#13;
progressively built up. In fact, basin planning, project planning, and expenditure prioritization will&#13;
become interactive processes, each feeding into the other.&#13;
6.    Beyond the preparation and selection criteria for individual investments and state water&#13;
planning, choice must still be exercised in planning and funding the state water sector program&#13;
due to overall limitations, present in any state or country, in availability of public expenditures.&#13;
The objective would be to fully fund a limited number of investments so that available expenditure&#13;
can be transformed to viable completed investments as expeditiously as possible.&#13;
7.    The dynamics of the choices available to Orissa will be continuously evolving over time.&#13;
First, knowledge of options will significantly improve during the course of the OWRCP period as&#13;
basin and state water planning and project specific knowledge develops. Secondly, political and&#13;
social development views will also change over time. Historically, constituent pressures have&#13;
played a dominant role in water development choices in most Indian states, and have been a&#13;
primary contributor to Orissa's current large backlog of ongoing projects, each incompletely&#13;
funded. Constituency pressures are appropriate and inevitable in any democracy, but Orissa&#13;
recognizes that these need counterbalancing by mechanisms for steering rational choices and&#13;
decisions based on sound knowledge and objective criteria.&#13;
8.    This will be achieved through multiple contributing developments under the project as&#13;
DOWR's capabilities expand. Primary elements will be through the development of DOWR's&#13;
basin planning, hydrological knowledge, project formulation, and programming and budgeting&#13;
activities. An important state forum for discussing priorities will be provided under the Water&#13;
Resources Board.&#13;
9.    Additionally, more sharply focused mechanisms will be employed specific to annual&#13;
budgeting and to approvals for investments. Decision has been taken that this will be through the&#13;
Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) process and Orissa's "High Powered&#13;
Committee" (HIPC) (para 14), also utilizing an investment ranking system as a basis for decisions&#13;
on funding allocations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 21&#13;

10.   Ranking of scheme completions and other water sector investments under categories (iv)&#13;
above will be as follows in order of priority:&#13;
Priority A:   High Priority - Fully Fund&#13;
Al.  OWRCP Funded Schemes&#13;
A2.   Other Externally Funded Projects, Flood Control and Drainage&#13;
Priority B:   Medium Priority - Implement to the extent that funds permit&#13;
Priority C:   Low Priority - Last call on funding if available&#13;
Priority D:   Candidate Development list&#13;
11.   Ranking will adjust over time within the discipline imposed by GOO's High Powered&#13;
Committee, the ARAPB, the annual discussions between GOO and the Planning Commission,&#13;
Delhi, and discussions between GOO/DOWR and the Bank, in particular at time of review of the&#13;
draft annual review, action plan and funding proposal.&#13;
12.   The table at Attachment I provides an illustration of the ranking exercise agreed for&#13;
1995/96 between GOO and the Bank. Budget estimates are provided only for Priorities (i)&#13;
through (iii) and the Priority A projects under priority (iv) (scheme completions) in the list.&#13;
Figures for OWRCP items are from the Appraisal cost table including contingencies. All of these&#13;
items will be fully funded to feasible implementation levels by GOO, in particular as concerns the&#13;
OWRCP and the other two Bank financed projects. Figures for non-OWRCP financed items are&#13;
DOWR estimates as approved in the Plan budget. Understanding between the Bank and GOO on&#13;
priorities below category A will be largely limited to understanding on their ranking and the&#13;
overall "good sense" of the program (focusing expenditures on a limited number of projects and&#13;
individual investments being soundly prepared and justified).&#13;
13.   GOO expenditures are expected to be incurred on a number of ongoing construction sites&#13;
in categories B and C. However, funding for such projects can be expected to be limited by the&#13;
overall limits of the state budget and the prior calls on expenditure for activities (i) to (iv)-A&#13;
above. Between them, Plan funding needs for categories (i) to (iv)-A in 1995/96 are estimated at&#13;
Rs. 2178 million (including Bank financed). Within this, the estimated funding needs for the&#13;
OWRCP are Rs. 1294 (of which estimated reimbursement from IDA would be about Rs 1090&#13;
million). This compares with a present 1995/96 DOWR Plan Budget objective of Rs. 3213&#13;
million made up of an allocation or Rs. 1859 million plus an incremental allocation of Rs. 1354&#13;
million against the OWRCP and the Hydrology Project. Actual DOWR Plan expenditures in&#13;
1994/95 were Rs. 1775 million, and in 1993/94 were Rs. 1570 million. The combined Plan needs&#13;
of categories (i) to (iv)-A (including OWRCP) are about 20% greater than Plan expenditures in&#13;
1994/95, which is achievable. Funding left for category (iv)-B and (iv)-C program would depend&#13;
on the degree to which Plan actuals reach the targeted Plan. The key concern for the Bank would&#13;
be the protection of the OWRCP, Dam Safety Project and Hydrology Project budgets. This&#13;
concern is mutually shared with GOO given the shared objectives above and the fact that on these&#13;
expenditures the costs are substantially reimbursed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

14.   The mechanism for expenditure review would fit in with the existing Governmental&#13;
system, with some adaptation to fit the requirements of the OWRCP and the objectives above.&#13;
The primary vehicle for expenditure planning and review would be the annual budget cycle&#13;
sharpened under the institutional improvements under the OWRCP through the Annual Review.&#13;
Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) described in the SAR paras 4.05 and 4.06. The ARAPB&#13;
would focus in detail on OWRCP activities but in its expenditure review and budget planning&#13;
sections would cover the entire program of DOWR and become the vehicle used by DOWR for&#13;
planning and justifying its overall program with GOO and the Planning Commission (GOI).&#13;
Timing of ARAPB production and review stages has accordingly been meshed with these needs.&#13;
The principal IDA supervision mission would coincide with the drafting and review stage of the&#13;
document, and the "Pre-Budget Scrutiny" of the Principal Secretary, DOWR, assisted by his&#13;
"Project Monitoring Committee" (SAR para 4.16). (The draft annual review, action plan and&#13;
funding proposal would be made available to IDA by October 31 each year for review and&#13;
comment, and the final ARAPB would be forwarded to IDA by April 15 each year.) The ARAPB&#13;
would include a ranking exercise as a means of justifying proposed expenditures. Supplementing&#13;
this process would be the oversight provided by GOO's "High Powered Committee. DOWR"&#13;
chaired by the Chief Secretary. This typically meets about monthly and provides opportunity for&#13;
interim budget adjustments and special scrutiny of particular programs and investment proposals.&#13;
The processes above would also be serviced by the progressive sophistication of DOWR&#13;
capabilities and available analysis from the water planning work, sharpened project preparation&#13;
and review processes, programming and budgeting capabilities, monitoring and evaluation, and in&#13;
other areas such as environmental assessment capabilities.&#13;
15.   During negotiations the above expenditure priorities, ranking system and mechanism for&#13;
planning and reviewing DOWR's expenditure program were confirmed. GOO also provided&#13;
evidence at negotiations that the Plan Budget allocation for the 1995/96 program included specific&#13;
allocations against OWRCP financed items corresponding to the figures for such items in the&#13;
attached table.&#13;

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.    Project Objectives. Orissa's future economic development and social welfare requires&#13;
better planning and allocation of water across sectors and, for irrigation - the largest user of&#13;
water, improved efficiency of public expenditures and water use, and enhanced agricultural&#13;
productivity. The project's primary objectives would be to: (a) improve the planning,&#13;
management and development process for the state's water resources; (b) increase agricultural&#13;
productivity through investments to improve existing schemes and complete viable incomplete&#13;
schemes; and (c) enhance institutional capability of the Department of Water Resources DOWR).&#13;
The proposed project would contribute to these objectives by helping GOO to establish multi-&#13;
sectoral water planning, enhance the efficiency of public expenditures, provide more efficient and&#13;
effective irrigation services, and upgrade DOWR's capabilities in all functional areas.&#13;
4.    Project Description. The Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (OWRCP) would&#13;
be a sector investment loan, financing an agreed state-wide program for Orissa's water sector&#13;
over a six year period. DOWR's state programn over the project period would involve a&#13;
combination of prioritized physical investments, policy reforms, and investment in institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 378 -&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
strengthening and capacity building. This would include emphasis on water planning,&#13;
environmental management, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) and agricultural intensification,&#13;
as well as strengthening of DOWR's capabilities in all functional and management areas. The&#13;
investment program would involve a major re-ordering of public expenditure priorities to&#13;
emphasize maintenance of water systems (to be funded by GOO), improved water management&#13;
(through rehabilitation and modernization of systems linked with farmer participation/turnover&#13;
and new cost recovery mechanisms) and selective scheme completions.&#13;
5.    Orissa' s new water sector strategy proposes an agenda of policy and institutional reforms&#13;
to strengthen the capacity of the DOWR to carry out its role in water resource use, planning, and&#13;
development. Underpinning the new strategy is a comprehensive framework for analyzing&#13;
policies and management options regarding water scarcity, efficiency of service, water allocation&#13;
and environmental impacts. Priority areas of action consistent with the new strategy are: (i)&#13;
'multi-sectoral water resources policy and planning' using the river basins as the planning unit;&#13;
(ii) 'institutional development' to upgrade management capability of DOWR through improved&#13;
functional responsibilities, institutional accountability and participation of farmers and the private&#13;
sector; (iii) farmer participation and turnover; (iv) redefined 'public expenditure priorities',&#13;
emphasizing improved performance of existing schemes, enhanced operations and maintenance,&#13;
completion of viable incomplete projects and improved cost recovery linked to service&#13;
improvements; and (v) 'improved technical performance' of water services delivery and&#13;
investment, including improved environmental management and R&amp;R.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
6.    Project Management and Implementation. The project would be implemented by Orissa's&#13;
DOWR. The Secretary, DOWR would have overall responsibility for project performance and&#13;
would be supported by an Additional Secretary who would also have the responsibility for the&#13;
new Directorate of Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R). Day-to-day project management&#13;
would be the responsibility of the Engineer in Chief (EIC) of DOWR, who would coordinate the&#13;
implementation of all project activities, supported by CEs or Directors responsible for their&#13;
respective management units: CE Mechanical; CE Water Services; CEs for Major Projects;&#13;
CEs for River Basins; and Directors for: Procurement; Monitoring, Evaluation, Program,&#13;
Budgeting and Accounts; and Personnel. The EIC will be assisted by an Additional EIC who&#13;
would have responsibility for Planning and Design functions through respective CEs for: Project&#13;
Planning and Formulation (CE-PF); Design and Research; Orissa Water Planning Organization&#13;
(OWPO); Hydrometry and Data Collection; and the Water and Land Management Institute&#13;
(WALMI). Environmental cells would be created in the OWPO and CE-PF units, plus supporting&#13;
cells at key basin level. The institutional structure, organigrams and position descriptions are at&#13;
Annex 3. Implementation responsibilities are at Attachment 2 of this Annex.&#13;
7.    For water planning (refer Annex 5) the Water Resources Board (WRB) would be the&#13;
highest state body for coordinating basin and state water planning and allocation across sectors.&#13;
The WRB is chaired by the Chief Secretary, with the Secretaries of Water Resources, Municipal&#13;
Administration, and Rural Development as Vice Chairmen, and includes representation from all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 379 -                             Annex 22&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
government departments associated with water use and quality. For coordination of the&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (refer Annex 12), the WRB would contain an Environmental Sub-&#13;
Committee. Specific management and implementation details for the Systems Improvement and&#13;
Farmer Turnover program are at Annex 6. Institutional and management arrangements for the&#13;
R&amp;R program are at Annex 10. Management arrangements for the Water Resources Research&#13;
Fund are at Annex 8. Institutional and management arrangements for the IPDP are at Annex 11.&#13;
8.    Training and Technical Assistance. Substantial training and technical assistance will be&#13;
required throughout DOWR in all technical and corporate management areas. Training and&#13;
consultancy needs have been prepared by DOWR and the Bank for each management unit, and&#13;
are detailed in their respective cost tables at Annex 18. To allow for the transfer of appropriate&#13;
skills from consultants to DOWR staff, technical assistance would be linked in all cases to staff&#13;
training through associating DOWR staff with consultants and interlinked formal training as&#13;
practicable. National and international study tours, training courses and temporary assignments&#13;
with experienced water agencies would also be used to provide first-hand exposure to new&#13;
technologies and management techniques. Technical assistance would include small consultancies&#13;
with individuals or firms as needed, in addition to a twinning arrangement throughout the project&#13;
period with an experienced consultancy group. Specific arrangements and procedures for training&#13;
and technical assistance are at Annex 13, including a draft TOR for the twinning arrangement.&#13;
9.    Additional to the above, DOWR would: (i) contract a senior institutional advisor,&#13;
institutional advisors and community organizers (NGOs) for the farmer organization and turnover&#13;
program (Annex 6); (ii) continue to hire the services of a national firm with expertise in&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation for assisting the R&amp;R Directorate with the R&amp;R program over at&#13;
least the first three project years; (iii) contract NGOs for implementation of the Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans (RAPs) (Annex 10); (iv) contract NGOs for implementation of the Indigenous&#13;
Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs); (v) contract a national fisheries specialist to advise on the&#13;
fisheries component of the R&amp;R program (Annex 10); establish a consultancy contract to assist&#13;
DOWR and GOO's Project Monitoring Committee (para. 16); (vi) under advice of the Research&#13;
Advisory Committee, contract state, national, and intemational research institutes for the research&#13;
and technology transfer program under the project's Water Resources Research Fund (Annex 8);&#13;
(vii) contract advisors for the Agricultural Intensification Program; and (viii) contract for other&#13;
needs as may be determined by DOWR and IDA during project implementation.&#13;
10.   Staff Continuity and Specialization. DOWR will ensure organizational and functional&#13;
effectiveness by establishing various categories of specialists. These specialists will represent the&#13;
broad range of functional responsibilities of DOWR from design to maintenance, to programming&#13;
and budgeting. Specialists will be selected and provided additional training through their&#13;
respective CEs, WALMI, other state and out-of-state agencies, and the consultancy consortium.&#13;
Study tours will also be arranged where appropriate to further enhance the expertise and&#13;
awareness of technologies and management skills of the specialists. Consistent with the&#13;
expenditure of time and funding to provide specialized training, posting policies will be modified&#13;
to take advantage of this additional training by retaining these employees in their specialized&#13;
disciplines. In many cases, transfers can still be accommodated but should be within the same&#13;
discipline. In other cases the specialization is so specific and limited that few if more than one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 22&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
location will be able to utilize that specialty. For example, an earth dam designer can only be&#13;
usefully posted with the CE for Design &amp; Research. In such instances the posting policy will&#13;
allow an extended stay in the same location, with due consideration to the preferences of the&#13;
employee. Promotions would actively favor employees staying in a post for more than three years&#13;
and employees staying in a particular specialty.&#13;
11.   Implementation Schedule. A Summary Implementation Schedule for the project is at&#13;
Attachment 1. Details by project component, including component-specific implementation&#13;
schedules as relevant, are in their respective annexes.&#13;
12.    Costs. Financing and Disbursements. Detailed project costs by component and year are&#13;
at Annex 18 and summarized in Chapter III of the main report. The financing plan is at para.&#13;
3.05. Disbursement arrangements are described at para. 3.16 and a Disbursement Schedule is at&#13;
Annex 20. Arrangements for retroactive financing, the special account and accounting and&#13;
auditing are at paras. 3.18 and 3.19.&#13;
13.   Procurement Implementation and Schedule. Procurement arrangements are described at&#13;
paras. 3.07 to 3.15 of the main report. Special management features to ensure efficient and timely&#13;
procurement are described (main report para. 3.14). Detailed procurement schedules with&#13;
contract packages, timing and estimated costs have been prepared for all field sites/components.&#13;
An Abstract of the Procurement Schedule for the project is at Attachment 3.&#13;
14.   Economic and Financial Analysis. The detailed economic and financial analysis for the&#13;
project is at Annex 19, which is summarized with risk assessments and description of&#13;
non-quantifiable benefits in Chapter V of the main report. The overall economic rate of return for&#13;
the project, including costs of all components but only the benefits of scheme completions and&#13;
SIFT components, is estimated at 17% Sensitivity tests and risks analysis are also at Annex 19.&#13;
C. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
15.   Management and Supervision Tools. The project is by nature complex and will require&#13;
close management, monitoring and supervision for its success. Successful implementation will be&#13;
sustained over the life of the project only by creating a management and monitoring structure&#13;
integral to and part of the management culture of the entire DOWR. This in turn will ensure that&#13;
this capability will continue beyond WRCP as a normal function of management at all levels&#13;
within the department. Skills in this area will be considerably enhanced through the introduction&#13;
of management information systems (MIS), monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) capability,&#13;
programming, budgeting and accounts (PB&amp;A), use of development indicators including the&#13;
results of a baseline survey, a system of quarterly reports and a closely followed Annual Review,&#13;
Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB), supplemented by special reports on certain components and a&#13;
mid-term review. These will form the basic tools for management, supervision and actions to&#13;
redress problem areas and exploit evolving opportunities for faster or modified implementation.&#13;
The above management systems will in themselves significantly raise the management capabilities&#13;
of DOWR, which were constrained within the former Orissa Irrigation Department (OID) due to&#13;
lack of basic management tools. The new organizational structure for DOWR (Annex 3) has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 381 -&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
developed along functional specialization lines and reflects the functional responsibilities of the&#13;
DOWR from this point into the foreseeable future. An important feature is the formation of&#13;
decentralized river basin management units for the provision and management of all water&#13;
services within a particular basin. This will ensure that more timely and responsive decisions&#13;
closer to the customers are made. These new organizational arrangements once fully established,&#13;
combined with strengthened management processes and intensive training and technical&#13;
assistance, will see DOWR evolve as a modem water agency. The management tools above are&#13;
described in the paragraphs below and relevant sections of the main report and its annexes.&#13;
1 6    GOO and GOI Project Monitoring. In view of the broad scope and the potential impact of&#13;
the project for the state, GOO will implement special measures to provide additional project&#13;
monitoring and coordination support at state level. A WRCP Project Monitoring Committee has&#13;
been formed by GOO comprising the Chief Secretary (chair), and Secretaries of DOWR, Revenue&#13;
&amp; Excise, Finance, Agriculture, Forest &amp; Environment, Welfare (R&amp;R), and the EIC as Member&#13;
Secretary. Additional members (who would have served with DOWR, other Government&#13;
departments or with the private sector or NGOs) would have relevant qualifications and&#13;
experience, a level of seniority, and a pro-active approach, enabling them to significantly&#13;
contribute to the Committee and its monitoring and guidance role for DOWR. Additionally, there&#13;
would be a state-level sub-committee of the PMC headed by the Principal Secretary DOWR, to&#13;
provide hands-on monitoring and supervision of OWRCP implementation. The Committee will&#13;
furnish minutes of its meetings to GOO and IDA, and as relevant on particular issues, to GOI&#13;
(e.g. Ministry of Water Resources, the Department of Economic Affairs, the Advisor (Irrigation)&#13;
of the Plarning Commission, and to other relevant Ministries such as Environment). As relevant&#13;
for particular issues, other GOO representatives will be invited to participate (e.g., Agricultural&#13;
Engineering Department, Environment, or District Collectors). Meetings will be at least quarterly&#13;
to discuss the quarterly reports and the ARAPB, and more often as needed. Additionally, a&#13;
Project Monitoring Consultancy will be arranged and funded under the WRCP with a national&#13;
consultancy firm. The Consultancy would assist the Committee in the periodic review and&#13;
assessment of the project as a whole, including site visits. The consultants would make two visits&#13;
per year, timed to overlap with IDA supervision missions, and would provide additional assistance&#13;
as needed. Consultant reports would be furnished to the committee and copied to IDA and GOI.&#13;
17.   IDA Supervision. An indicative IDA Supervision Schedule is at Attachment 4, and would&#13;
be adjusted as needed during project implementation. The overall plan comprises in a typical year&#13;
two formal visits, supplemented by correspondence, clearances and visits of DOWR staff to the&#13;
Delhi office as needed. One of the visits would be short and primarily of an expediting nature:&#13;
e.g. checking progress, helping resolve interim constraints, or dealing with consultancy,&#13;
procurement, disbursement and accounting matters that arise. One main mission a year would be&#13;
timed to coincide with the review of the draft Annual Review, Action Plan and Funding Proposal&#13;
in the October/November period and would make selective visits to the field, go through all&#13;
aspects of the project, help determine the forthcoming year's program and review the program&#13;
budget. GOO's Project Monitoring consultants (para. 16) would, inter alia, program their&#13;
missions to coincide with IDA supervision visits. Visits of the core staff of the main consultancy&#13;
contract would also be timed where possible to overlap with the IDA missions, and as needed,&#13;
similar arrangements would be made for specialists, especially where decisions are required on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 382 -&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
particular aspects of the project. Special meetings of GOO's 'Project Monitoring Committee"&#13;
(para. 16) would be convened by GOO at the time of the ID X visits for discussion with IDA staff.&#13;
These arrangements would enable harnessing of the required snecializations to enable effective&#13;
multi-disciplinary supervision and close interaction between DOWR and its consultants, GOO and&#13;
IDA, while keeping IDA resource requirements within reasonable dimensions. The IDA&#13;
Supervision Plan at Attachment 4 also allows for: (i) more intensive supervision at project start-&#13;
up, including in procurement and disbursement, institutional reorganization, for the systems&#13;
improvement and farmer turnover program, for the R&amp;R program and for basin planning; (ii) the&#13;
interim review of the farmer turnover program in PY2; and (iii) the mid-term review in PY3.&#13;
18.   Monitoring, Evaluation, Programming and Budgeting. With the emphasis of DOWR on&#13;
improving overall management of water resources in Orissa, there is a need to consolidate and&#13;
report the activities of DOWR in a format which will assist the EIC and the government in&#13;
assessing program progress and performance, and for programming and budgeting to maximize&#13;
effectiveness. There will be a Unit for Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Budget and Accounts&#13;
at the level of Director, reporting directly to the EIC. This unit will also develop and maintain a&#13;
Management Information System to support all activities in DOWVR. Consultancy assistance will&#13;
be used to guide the establishment and initial operation of the Unit, and as needed thereafter.&#13;
19.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The new Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) sub-unit will: (i)&#13;
monitor expenditures on programs relative to total estimated costs; (ii) conduct post-project&#13;
evaluations to compare benefits with original planning estimates; and (iii) evaluate organizational&#13;
effectiveness and performance of units within DOWVR, for compliance with DOWR's goals and&#13;
objectives. The M&amp;E sub-unit would utilize the program budgeting process for much of its data&#13;
to evaluate progress of projects and programs. At the request of any organizational unit or as&#13;
directed by the EIC, the M&amp;E unit would collect data, conduct site visits, initiate discussions with&#13;
water users and the public, and evaluate reports to determine any deficiencies or problems and&#13;
provide a valuable feedback with recommendations for corrective action.&#13;
20.   The Monitoring and Evaluation unit will also monitor and evaluate development effects on&#13;
crop yields, total crop production, crop diversification, farm income levels, water distribution&#13;
efficiencies and project affected persons. The current situation will be assessed based on field&#13;
visits, discussions with water users, sample surveys, questionnaires, and review of official&#13;
publications. The evaluation will determine these effects by comparing the situation at a given&#13;
time with the Baseline Survey (Annex 17). Annual reports will be prepared for dissemination to&#13;
the State, Government of India, the World Bank, universities and others. Also, the unit will&#13;
assess the effectiveness of the Farmer Organization and Turnover Program and its impact on&#13;
water delivery efficiencies, levels of service delivery, agricultural productivity, and other factors.&#13;
The unit will utilize the services of consultants or local or other universities for special surveys&#13;
and analyses, as appropriate. The development effects could be used in the future to assist the&#13;
Government in setting agricultural production targets by matching crop water demands with&#13;
available water supplies by region or command.&#13;
21.   Program. Budgeting and Accounting. DOW?R's new Programme, Budget and Accounts&#13;
sub-unit (PB&amp;A) will establish, maintain., and administer the financial management systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 383 -&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
including program, budget and cost allocation/accounting systems. The system will be used to&#13;
develop annual budgets by consolidating budget requests from all DOWR organizational elements&#13;
and ensure that the final budget request is consistent with the policies and instructions from the&#13;
Government. The unit will produce management reports tracking program progress and will&#13;
assist the EIC with financial management of DOWR. The unit will provide periodic management&#13;
reports for use by the EIC, the Additional EIC, CEs and other managers for decision-making&#13;
purposes, as well as for information and use of the Project Monitoring Committee and IDA.&#13;
22.   Development Indicators. Development Indicators (Attachment 5) corresponding to the&#13;
project objectives at para. 3 have been chosen to help track the project's impact on the project&#13;
objectives. Attachment 5 provides a matrix of monitorable indicators against each project&#13;
objective and comments on how such indicators may be monitored. Indicators include physical&#13;
indiicators for the field components and qualitative and progress indicators for the other&#13;
components, such as: implementation of the institutional restructuring and strengthening&#13;
DOWR's effectiveness; evidence of agricultural growth, productivity and crop diversification;&#13;
increased reliability and equity of water delivery; implementation and effectiveness of the farmer&#13;
participation and turnover program; and improved planning, programming and budgeting.&#13;
23.   Baseline Survey. To provide a basis for monitoring the development impact of the&#13;
project, and further refining the development indicators above, a baseline survey to be conducted&#13;
by consultants would be carried out in PY] (TOR for the Baseline Survey is at Annex 17). The&#13;
survey would comprise an overall survey supplemented by more detailed surveys at the level of&#13;
sample commands, and remote sensing for assessment of effective irrigation coverage and&#13;
cropping patterns, and would cover the following aspects: engineering indicators for operational&#13;
and maintenance performance, agricultural preduction indicators. performance indicators for the&#13;
institutional restructuring and strengthening; and indicators f;r the farmer participation and&#13;
turnover program. Survey decision would be closely tied in with the monitoring objective&#13;
indicated in the Monitorable Indicators of Development Impact (Attachment 5).&#13;
24.   Quarterly Reports. The quarterly reports would be issued within three weeks of the end&#13;
of each quarter and would be issued by the Monitoring, Evaluation, Programme, Budget &amp;&#13;
Accounts Unit after clearance from the EIC. Each quarterly report would be produced in&#13;
standard format and would track the project by its individual components, including physical and&#13;
financial progress, procurement, disbursement, and qualitative data from the baseline survey.&#13;
Emphasis would be on benefits, with data and written material restricted to items of clear&#13;
management and decision making relevance. The reports would incorporate brief submissions&#13;
from each implementation unit in DOWR which would quantify and conmpare progress with the&#13;
agreed targets in the Staff Appraisal Report and the previous ARAPB, and would highlight key&#13;
issues including problems and constraints. The report would be prefaced with an overview&#13;
section from the EIC's office summarizing decisions or recommendations based on the overview&#13;
and each management unit's submission. This would include commenta!4 *on the status of&#13;
decisions/actions outstanding from the last quarterly report and review oi any decisions/actions&#13;
still required related to recommendations of the GOO Project Monitoring Committee, GOI or&#13;
IDA. The reports would be presented to the Secretary DOWR, and copied to the Project&#13;
Monitoring Committee, relevant state officials, GO6 and IDA. The Project Monitoring&#13;
&#13;

Committee would meet after each quarterly report cycle to discuss and determine actions&#13;
required, and IDA would provide written advice and/or direct input during supervision missions.&#13;
25.   Annual Review. Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB). The ARAPB would be the main&#13;
vehicle for annual review of project performance and future needs, for adjusting DOWR's&#13;
program as needed, for budgeting by GOO of DOWR's Plan and Non-Plaii expenditures, and for&#13;
major review and supervision by GOO, GOI and IDA. For DOWR it would provide annual&#13;
opportunity to assess its program, to propose adjustments as needed, and to present its&#13;
consolidated plan and justification for financing needs for the forthcoming year. The ARAPB&#13;
would review for each component and responsible unit the past year's achievements in terms of&#13;
development indicators. physical targets and expenditures. and propose a justified work program&#13;
and proposed expenditure budget for the forthcoming fiscal year. It would also include: (i) a&#13;
description of each year's works, schedule of activities, staffing requirements and distribution of&#13;
responsibilities; (ii) proposed expenditures for the next fiscal year compared with the past year's&#13;
actual expenditures and the budgeted and expected expenditures of the current year; (iii) details&#13;
on major civil works contracts exceeding US$300,000, and equipment and vehicle contracts&#13;
exceeding US$200,000; and (iv) a financing plan and sources of funds. Special sections would&#13;
cover: (v) review of implementation progress related to the institutional strengthening and policy&#13;
reforms under the project; (vi) detailed review and proposal of maintenance needs (command-by-&#13;
command) and corresponding non-Plan expenditure requirements; (vii) item-wise review of the&#13;
overall Plan expenditure program of DOWR with justified proposals for the forthcoming year;&#13;
(viii) the farmer participation and turnover program; and (ix) progress of state water planning&#13;
under WRB/OWPO.&#13;
26.   Intensive Monitoring and Review of Farmer Organization and Turnover Program. Due to&#13;
the importance and innovative nature of the Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover&#13;
program, in particular the farmer participation and turnover aspects, a phased approach will be&#13;
taken, complemented by intensive monitoring by an FOT consultant who will be attached to the&#13;
DOWR CE Water Services unit. After about 18 months, an evaluation of Phase 1 will be&#13;
conducted culminating in an FOT planning workshop which will define the approach taken in&#13;
Phase 2. A similar evaluation of Phase 2 will be conducted about three and a half years into the&#13;
project that would provide the basis for planning in Phase 3. This evaluation procedure would&#13;
enable feedback and recommendations sufficiently early in project implementation to enable timely&#13;
modifications, including adjustments and expansion or scaling back of the program if needed.&#13;
27.   Midterm Review. By March 31, 1999 (end PY3), GOO/DOWR would carry out, jointly&#13;
with IDA and GOI, a Midterm Review of project progress and possible need for adjustments to&#13;
components, implementation arrangements and policy reforms, and thereafter implement its&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
28.   Implementation Completion Report. An Implementation Completion Report would be&#13;
prepared by GOO on the basis of IDA's guidelines, not later than six months from the closing date&#13;
of the Credit.&#13;

            India - Orissa Water Resources
            Consolidation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Orissa's future economic
            development and social welfare require better planning and
            allocation of water across sectors and, for irrigation,
            improved efficiency of public expenditures and water use,
            and enhanced agricultural productivity. The Orissa Water
            Resources Consolidation Project has the following primary
            objectives: 1) improve the planning, management and
            development process for the state's water resources; 2)
            increase agricultural productivity through investments to
            improve existing schemes and complete viable incomplete
            schemes; and 3) enhance the department of water resources
            institutional capability. The project will contribute to
            these objectives by helping the government of Orissa (GOO)
            to establish multi-sectoral water planning, enhance the
            efficiency of public expenditures, provide more efficient
            and effective irrigation services, and upgrade DOWR's
            capabilities in all functional areas. The components of the
            project are the following: 1) scheme completions; 2) systems
            improvement and farmer participation/turnover; 3) basin
            planning and environmental action plan; 4) water resources
            research and agricultural intensification; 5) institutional
            reorganization and strengthening; 6) resettlement and
            rehabilitation; and 7) indigenous peoples development plan.
