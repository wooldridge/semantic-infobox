FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They  include   several  country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and  the   views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
Married women wanting no more children, who are exposed to the risk&#13;
of pregnancy and are not using contraception, are defined as having unmet need&#13;
for contraception for limiting purposes. Married women seeking to delay&#13;
wanted pregnancies, who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy, but are not&#13;
using contraception, have unmet need for contraception for spacing purposes.&#13;
This paper reviews procedures for calculating unmet need and assesses&#13;
measurement errors, and their consequences, for estimating the number of women&#13;
who would benefit from increased availability of modern contraceptive methods&#13;
and for estimating the potential demand for such methods. High and low&#13;
estimates of unmet need for contraception for purposes of limiting family size&#13;
are presented for rural and urban areas of thirty-six developing countries and&#13;
estimates of unmet need for spacing purposes for nine countries. Low&#13;
estimates assume that women who want no more children or want to delay births&#13;
for more than one year and have been breastfeeding for less than one year or&#13;
are using traditional methods of contraception such as withdrawal or rhythm do&#13;
not have unmet need. High estimates count these women as having unmet need.&#13;
In half of the countries included in the sample, the high estimate of&#13;
unmet need for limiting purposes exceeds 20 percent of married women of&#13;
childbearing age, with levels of unmet need usually being higher in Latin&#13;
America and Asia than in Africa or the Middle East. Measures of unmet need&#13;
are lower in the latter two continents primarily because of smaller&#13;
proportions of women wanting no more children. Unmet need among rural women&#13;
exceeds that of urban women in all fourteen Latin American countries for which&#13;
data are available and in eight of the other twenty-one countries. Low&#13;
estimates of unmet need are typically about half the magnitude of the high&#13;
estimates.&#13;
The high estimates of unmet need for spacing purposes range from&#13;
3 percent of all married women of childbearing age in Colombia and Korea to&#13;
14 percent in Bangladesh. Only in Bangladesh and Thailand are the low&#13;
estimates more than half the magnitude of the high estimates. Levels of unmet&#13;
need for spacing are similar in rural and urban areas. According to the high&#13;
estimates, unmet need for spacing accounts for more than one-quarter of all&#13;
unmet need for contraception in five of the nine Latin American and Asian&#13;
countries for which data are available.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
Las mujeres casadas que no desean tener mas hijos, estin&#13;
expuestas al riesgo del embarazo y no estan usando m6todos anticonceptivos&#13;
se definen como mujeres que tienen una necesidad de anticonceptivos para&#13;
fines de limitaci6n. Las mujeres casadas que quieren aplazar embarazos&#13;
deseados, que estan expuestas al riesgo del embarazo pero no estAn usando&#13;
anticonceptivos tienen una necesidad de anticonceptivos para fines de&#13;
espaciamiento. En este trabajo se examinan distintos procedimientos para&#13;
calcular la magnitud de la necesidad de anticonceptivos y se evaldan los&#13;
errores de medici6n, asi como sus consecuencias en lo que respecta a&#13;
estimar el ntunero de mujeres que se beneficiarian si hubiera mas metodos&#13;
anticonceptivos modernos y a calcular la demanda potencial de dichos&#13;
m6todos. Se presentan estimaciones altas y bajas de la necesidad de&#13;
anticonceptivos para fines de limitaci6n de la familia en zonas rurales y&#13;
urbanas de 36 paises en desarrollo y estimaciones de la necesidad de&#13;
anticonceptivos para fines de espaciamiento correspondientes a nueve&#13;
paises. En las estimaciones bajas se supone que las mujeres que no desean&#13;
tener mas hijos o que desean aplazar los nacimientos por mas de un anio y&#13;
han estado amamantando durante menos de un aiio o estan usando un metodo&#13;
anticonceptivo tradicional, como el del coito interrumpido o el de la&#13;
continencia peri6dica, no tienen necesidad de anticonceptivos. En las&#13;
estimaciones altas estas mujeres se cuentan como si tuvieran necesidad de&#13;
ellos.&#13;
En la mitad de los paises comprendidos en la muestra la&#13;
estimaci6n alta de la necesidad de anticonceptivos para fines de&#13;
limitaci6n excede del 20% de las mujeres casadas en edad de concebir, y en&#13;
general el nivel de la necesidad es mas alto en America Latina y Asia que&#13;
en Africa o el Oriente Medio. En estas dos ultimas regiones la necesidad&#13;
de anticonceptivos es menor, principalmente porque hay una menor&#13;
proporci6n de mujeres que no desean tener mas hijos. La necesidad de&#13;
anticonceptivos es mayor entre las mujeres de las zonas rurales que entre&#13;
las de las zonas urbanas en el caso de los 14 paises latinoamericanos&#13;
sobre los cuales hay datos y en el de ocho de los otros 21 paises.&#13;
Tipicamente las estimaciones bajas de la necesidad de anticonceptivos&#13;
ascienden a la mitad de las estimaciones altas.&#13;
Las estimaciones altas de la necesidad de anticonceptivos para&#13;
fines de espaciamiento oscilan entre el 3% de las mujeres casadas en edad&#13;
de concebir, en el caso de Colombia y Corea, y el 14% en el de&#13;
Bangladesh. Bangladesh y Tailandia son los unicos paises en que las&#13;
estimaciones bajas ascienden a mas de la mitad de las estimaciones altas.&#13;
La magnitud de la necesidad de anticonceptivos para fines de espaciamiento&#13;
es la misma en las zonas rurales y en las zonas urbanas. Segdn las&#13;
estimaciones altas, la necesidad de anticonceptivos para fines de&#13;
espaciamiento representa mas del 25% de la necesidad global de&#13;
anticonceptivos en cinco de los nueve paises latinoamericanos y asiaticos&#13;
sobre los cuales hay datos.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
In order to measure the number of married women likely to benefit&#13;
from easier access to family planning services and to assess potential demand&#13;
for modern contraception, demographers have developed the concept of unmet&#13;
need (Westoff 1978; Westoff and Pebley 1981, 1983; and Nortman 1982).&#13;
Contraception can be used both for avoiding births altogether and for delaying&#13;
a wanted pregnancy. Married women wanting no more children, who are exposed&#13;
to the risk of pregnancy and are not using contraception, are defined as&#13;
having unmet need for contraception for limiting purposes. Married women&#13;
seeking to delay wanted pregnancies, who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy&#13;
but are not using contraception, are defined as having unmet need for spacing&#13;
purposes. The purposes of this paper are to evaluate alternative measures of&#13;
unmet need, to assess their biases, and to summarize unmet need estimates for&#13;
rural and urban areas of 36 developing countries. Estimates are based on data&#13;
collected in the World Fertility Surveys (WFS) and the Contraceptive&#13;
Prevalence Surveys (CPS). The estimates of unmet need discussed below&#13;
describe potential rather than actual demand for contraception. The actual&#13;
number of new contraceptors expected from increased access to family planning&#13;
methods will depend on the strength of motivation to restrict or delay&#13;
childbearing and the money, time, and psychic costs of contraception.&#13;
II. Definition, measurement, and interpretation of unmet need&#13;
Unmet need is defined simply as the proportion of married women&#13;
exposed to the risk of pregnancy who wish to avoid additional births or to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
delay wanted pregnancies but are not using contraception. Egcluding unmarried&#13;
women from the definition is a restriction imposed by lack of date on exposure&#13;
to the risk of pregnancy9 fertility desires9 and contraceptive use among&#13;
unmarried women. Translating this simple definition into actual estimctes of&#13;
unmet need is not straightforward9 since estimates vary with the definition&#13;
and measurement of desires for additional children9 exposure to the risk of&#13;
pregnancy9 and contraceptive use (Westoff and Pebley 1981p 1983X) In this&#13;
section I discuss9 first9 unmet need for limiting purposes and then unmet need&#13;
for spacingo&#13;
Desires for additional children&#13;
The starting point for calculating unmuet need is estimating the&#13;
proportion of women who want no more children. Both the CPS and eJFS&#13;
questionnaires included a question on whether or not women wanted additional&#13;
childreno  Calculating the proportion of women wanting no more children from&#13;
this direct question on family size desires is preferred to the alternative of&#13;
comparing actual with desired family size (g"If you could choose eszactly the&#13;
number of children to have in your whole life9 how many would that be?°°) and&#13;
assuming that women whose actual family size is equal to or more than desired&#13;
family size want no more children0 There are three reasons for preferring the&#13;
former procedureo First9 a question on desired family size is more&#13;
hypothetical than a question on whether or not additional children are wanted9&#13;
since women cannot costlessly choose faamily size nor have fewer children than&#13;
they already have0 Second9 previous research indicates that women when re-&#13;
interviewed respond more consistently to questions on whether they want&#13;
additional children than they do to questions on desired family :.ze0    In E&#13;
test of the stability of responses to questions included in the Xndonesian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
WFS, MacDonald et. al. (1978) found that a high proportion of women re-&#13;
interviewed after four months gave the same answer to a question on whether or&#13;
not additional children were wanted, but only 46 percent gave identical&#13;
responses to a question on desired family size. In an evaluation of a post-&#13;
enumeration survey of 286 women interviewed one month after the 1973 KAP&#13;
Survey, in Taiwan, China, Coombs (1977, p. 221) reports that 92 percent of&#13;
women gave the same answer to a question on whether they wanted additional&#13;
children, while only 67 percent gave an identical response to a question on&#13;
preferred family size ("Suppose you were recently married and were able to&#13;
have just the number of children you wanted, how many would that be?").&#13;
Finally, and most importantly, recent research has indicated that&#13;
responses to questions on desires for additional children have validity in&#13;
that they predict both contraceptive use and subsequent fertility. In an&#13;
analysis of twenty WFS data sets, Johnson-Acsadi and Weinberger (1980, p. 76)&#13;
report that, among women exposed to the risk of pregnancy, contraceptive&#13;
prevalence rates among women wanting no more children exceeded prevalence&#13;
rates among women wanting more children by at least 10 percent in all&#13;
countries except Nepal, where the difference was 8 percent. Differences&#13;
exceeded 10 percent in most countries even after adjustment for wife's age,&#13;
education, employment status, and number of surviving children. Longitudinal&#13;
studies in Taiwan, China, and the Republic of Korea show that responses to&#13;
this question predict subsequent fertility. Among a sample of married women&#13;
aged 18-39 initially interviewed in 1967 in Taiwan, China, four-fifths of&#13;
those wanting an additional child had at least one additional birth by 1974,&#13;
while only one-fifth to one-fourth of women wanting no more children had an&#13;
additional birth over the same period (Hermalin et. al. 1979). In a sample of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Korean married women with at least two children interviewed initially in 19719&#13;
88 percent of those wanting another child had an additional birth by 1976&#13;
compared to only 56 percent of women wanting no more children (calculated from&#13;
data given in Foreit and Suh9 19809 Table 89 po 97). There are no similar&#13;
tests of the predictive value of questions on desired family size, although&#13;
comparisons of actual to preferred family sizes give poorer predictions of&#13;
contraceptive use and subsequent fertility in Taiwan and Korea than do&#13;
responses to questions on desires for additional children (Boulier 1984b).&#13;
Still9 not all women wanting no more children use contraception and&#13;
not all women reporting desires for limiting family size are successful in&#13;
doing soo Several factors may account for these discrepancies between&#13;
attitudes and behavior. Hypotheses for these discrepancies and their&#13;
implications for measuring and interpreting unmet need measures are as&#13;
follows9&#13;
Lo   Some women may not take into account costs of regulating fertility in&#13;
answering questions on family size goals. If the benefits of avoiding births&#13;
are small relative to the monetary and psychic costs of regulating fertility9&#13;
then some women wanting no more children will have little motivation to use&#13;
contraception. For these women9 unmet need is measured correctly since they&#13;
would benefit from increased access to contraception and since lowering&#13;
contraceptive costs sufficiently would increase the quantity of contraceptives&#13;
demanded. Note9 however9 that some women may take account of the costs of&#13;
contraception in responding to questions on desires for additional children.&#13;
Suppose9 for example9 that modern contraceptives are only avEi½lble at a very&#13;
high price9 so that the only relevant alternative to more births are unsafe&#13;
abortions or abstinence (and possible marital disruption), Such women may&#13;
&#13;

well state that they want additional children and yet still adopt contra-&#13;
ception if it were more readily available. Unmet need is understated in this&#13;
case. There is no direct evidence on this point, but CPS and WFS survey data&#13;
indicate that the proportion of women wanting no more children is higher among&#13;
women knowing of a nearby source of family planning services compared to women&#13;
knowing only of distant sources or without knowledge of a source (Boulier&#13;
1984a).&#13;
2.   Questions on desires for additional children are asked only of&#13;
women. Decisions to have more births or to use contraception involve both&#13;
husband and wife. If there is disagreement between husband and wife and the&#13;
wife considers only her own preferences in responding to questions on family&#13;
size desires, then it is likely that calculations of unmet need based on this&#13;
question will overstate (understate) demand for contraception if the husband&#13;
wants more (fewer) children than his wife. The direction of bias in the&#13;
estimate of unmet need will vary from country to country, since in some&#13;
countries where both husbands and wives have been interviewed husbands want&#13;
more children than wives while in others the reverse is true.&#13;
3.   Unanticipated economic events, child mortality, unforeseen health&#13;
problems of husband or wife and additional experience with childrearing as&#13;
time passes may lead couples to alter fertility plans. As a result, prefer-&#13;
ences ascertained at one date may be imperfect predictors of future fertility&#13;
choices if couples' expectations about the future are not realized.&#13;
4.   Women replying that they do not know whether they want additional&#13;
children are assumed to want more children. Some unknown fraction of these&#13;
women may in fact want no more children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.   Finally9 at a more mundane level, no method of contraception is&#13;
perfectly effective--egcept for sterilization and complete abstinenceo Some&#13;
fraction of women wanting no more children but using even modern, highly&#13;
effective methods will eitperience contraceptive failure. Some women wanting&#13;
more children will be unable to have them because of their own or their&#13;
husband's infecundity.&#13;
Exposure to the risk of pregnancy0   Among women not wanting more&#13;
children9 those not exposed to the risk of pregnancy do not have unmet need.&#13;
This category clearly includes women who are pregnant at the tirwe of the&#13;
survey and women who are infecund9 including those sterilized fc'&#13;
contraceptive purposes0   It may also include breastfeeding women who are not&#13;
ovulating0  Self-reports of pregnancy status are sufficiently unirelicble that&#13;
Goldman and Hestoff (1980) discouraged their use as a proxy for estimating&#13;
current fertility0   On average9 it is li'tely that the proportion of pregnant&#13;
women is understated9 since early pregnencies (those in the first two months)&#13;
are not necessarily detected.&#13;
Estimates of infecundity are based on answers to the following&#13;
question°  "As far as you know9 is it physically possible for you and your&#13;
husband to have a child9 supposing you wanted one?"    Little is known about the&#13;
accuracy of reports on infecundity0 Mortman (19829 po 127) suggests that&#13;
self-reports on infecundity in developing countries are likely to understate&#13;
actual infecundity given the high v&amp;lue placed on reproductive capacity0&#13;
tJestoff and Pebley (19829 ppO 7-8) compare subjective reports of infecundity&#13;
(encluding the contraceptively sterilized) with the proportion of currently&#13;
married non-pregnant women having an open birth intervel for fivn years or&#13;
more and not reporting contraceptive use in that interval0 £-Zit&#142;, the eaception&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
of Jordan and Malaysia, this behavioral measure of infecundity was higher than&#13;
the subjective measure in all of the eighteen countries included in their&#13;
sample. In five countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, the Dominican Republic,&#13;
Guyana, and Jamaica), the behavioral measure of the proportion infecund was&#13;
more than twice the proportion of women classified as infecund by subjective&#13;
reports (Westoff and Pebley 1983, Table 2). The mean value of the percentage&#13;
of married women classified as infecund by the behavioral measure was 16&#13;
percent compared to only 10 percent using the subjective measure.&#13;
What are the consequences of using subjective reports on infecundity&#13;
for assessing unmet need? To some extent, the consequences depend on the&#13;
purpose for which the unmet need calculation is used. If the purpose of the&#13;
measure is to assess the size of the population most in need of contraception,&#13;
then "need" is overstated by including women who have managed to limit&#13;
fertility even though no contraceptive use is reported. However, if the&#13;
purpose of the calculation is to measure potential demand resulting from&#13;
increased availability of contraceptives, then "unmet need" is not seriously&#13;
upward biased if women who are truly infecund believe themselves to be fecund,&#13;
since they will be potential consumers of family planning services. Unmet&#13;
need is overstated only if women knowing they can not have additional children&#13;
report themselves as fecund.&#13;
Because breastfeeding inhibits ovulation, some women who are&#13;
breastfeeding are not exposed to the risk of pregnancy. Among lactating&#13;
women, the proportion who have resumed ovulation increases with duration of&#13;
breastfeeding. Consequently, it would seem that one might be able to estimate&#13;
the fraction of lactating women not exposed to the risk of pregnancy from data&#13;
on duration of breastfeeding. However, because of differences in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
breastfeeding practices (e.g., frequency of suckling), the relation between&#13;
duration and the anovulatory period varies across countries. For example, in&#13;
Guyana9 Jordan9 and Panama each month of breastfeeding adds only .3 months to&#13;
the birth interval compared to .7 months in Sri Lanka (Jain and Bongaarts&#13;
1981). Thus9 it is not possible to develop a simple method, easily applied to&#13;
all countries, for estimating the proportion of lactating women exposed to the&#13;
risk of pregnancy.&#13;
Westoff and Pebley (1983) attempted to assess the potential impact of&#13;
alternative treatments of breastfeeding on the measurement of unmet need by&#13;
assuming first that all lactating women were exposed to the risk of pregnancy&#13;
and then assuming that women beastfeeding for less than one year were not&#13;
exposed to the risk of pregnancy. For the eighteen countries they studied, an&#13;
average of about 5 percent fewer married women were estimated to have unmet&#13;
need when those breastfeeding for less than one year were assumed not to be at&#13;
risk. The reductions in estimated need exceeded 7 percent in Indonesia, Peru,&#13;
and Thailand and were smaller than 3 percent in Costa Rica and Jamaica0&#13;
If the purpose of an unmet need measure is to estimate the proportion&#13;
of women who would benefit from greater use of modern contraception, there are&#13;
two reasons why the Westoff-Pebley correction overestimates the reduction in&#13;
unmet need resulting from subfecundity of breastfeeding women0 First,&#13;
breastfeeding has a large impact on aggregate fertility, but is unreliable as&#13;
a method of limiting fertility for individuals0 A study of five Latin&#13;
American populations found that the cumulative percentage of noncontracepting&#13;
lactating women having a fertile conception (for example, a conception leading&#13;
to a live birth) within twelve months of a previous birth averaged 27 percent,&#13;
ranging from 14 percent in Peru to 46 percent in Costa Rica (Goldman, et al,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1983). Second, as is apparent from these data, lactating women should not be&#13;
assumed to be anovulatory for as long as one year. While in rural Senegal the&#13;
period of post-partum amenorrhea (a proxy for the anovulatory period) averages&#13;
18 months and breastfeeding averages 23 months, studies of populations&#13;
elsewhere show that even among women who are fuLly breastfeeding return of&#13;
menses occurs within six months in 20 percent to 50 percent of women, and&#13;
between 12 percent and 78 percent of women ovulate before first menses&#13;
(Population Information Program 1981, p. 540). Conception rates among&#13;
lactating women in the first six months following a birth are one-half to two-&#13;
thirds as high as those in months six through twelve in the five Latin&#13;
American countries examined by Goldman et al. 1983, Table 5). If it is&#13;
assumed that the anovulatory period among lactating women is only six months,&#13;
then allowing for subfecundity among lactating women would reduce unmet need&#13;
by less than the 5 percent figure reported by Westoff and Pebley. Since the&#13;
proportion of women lactating diminishes with time, assuming only a six month&#13;
period of subfecundity rather than a twelve month period would not reduce the&#13;
5 percent figure by as much as one-half.&#13;
If the purpose of an unmet need calculation is to assess potential&#13;
demand for contraception resulting from increased contraceptive availability,&#13;
then the appropriate treatment of lactating women depends on their responses&#13;
to reduced contraceptive costs. Direct evidence on this issue is not&#13;
available, although it has been suggested that prolonged breastfeeding is a&#13;
substitute for contraception (Jain and Bongaarts 1981; Knodel and Debalvaya,&#13;
1981). Knodel and Debalvaya report that Thai women who do not want more&#13;
children tend to breastfeed for longer periods of time than do women wanting&#13;
additional children, even after controlling for education of mother and region&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of residence0  The proportion of woomen breacfeading Is less and _hi averEge&#13;
duration of breastfeeding is shorter in Thasiland and in other countriea  among&#13;
user of modern contraception than among no-auoaTs (Population Infozmatiom&#13;
Program 1981, po 538)o  In Thailand, differ@ene remain after djumsaent for&#13;
education of mother and re(gion of recidence and after elimiati n    - t  pill&#13;
from the set of idern methods (Knodel and Dabalveya 19D ppp 373 374). Jd&amp;ii&#13;
and Dongaerts (1981, Dp  96) report thct the pEatial COrEElat.ion eceCffiient&#13;
between use of contraception and duration of breafeedin     is nsEative and&#13;

including mother's age, parity, education, and res&amp;idence0 The coefficient ie&#13;
not statistically significantly different from zEro in Xndonesia end is&#13;
poseitive In Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#13;
The findings of these studieo suggest that increaed avavilability of&#13;
modern contraception may induce some Lactating t'oE-sn to chift fron breast-&#13;
feeding to contraception0   Indeed, ths proportions of uomen initieallly&#13;
breastfeeding and average durations of breaectfeeding have declilned in come&#13;
countries with extensivs family planning activities0o  In Tciwan, China, the&#13;
percentage of infents breastfed dropped fron 93 percent in 1966 to only 50&#13;
percent in 1980 and the asverage duration of breastfeediL a2mong .ildrcn ever&#13;

or whether they were due to increased education of women, increased employment&#13;
opportunities outside the home, a shift from home delivery of babies to modern&#13;
clinics and hospitals, or other sources of change. A study of breastfeeding&#13;
behavior of women as it differs among areas of differential access to family&#13;
planning services would yield information on the likely changes in demand&#13;
resulting from increased availability, but no such study has yet been&#13;
conducted.&#13;
Contraceptive methods. The last step in the calculation of unmet&#13;
need for limiting purposes is to subtract women who are contracepting from&#13;
those wanting no more children and exposed to the risk of pregnancy. The&#13;
important decision here is whether one subtracts all users of contraception or&#13;
only users of "efficient" methods of contraception. Contraceptive failure&#13;
rates of women using traditional methods such as withdrawal, rhythm, and folk&#13;
methods are high relative to failure rates of those using modern methods such&#13;
as the pill, IUD, injection, condom, or female scientific methods. In the&#13;
five Latin American countries examined by Goldman, et al (1981, Table 5), the&#13;
proportion of women conceiving within two years of a birth was more than twice&#13;
as high for those who had used withdrawal or rhythm than for users of the&#13;
pill, IUD, or injection. The two year cumulative failure rate among condom&#13;
users was three-fourths that of those who used withdrawal or rhythm. If the&#13;
purpose of calculating unmet need is to establish the number of women who&#13;
would benefit from modern contraception, then users of inefficient methods&#13;
would be beneficiaries and should therefore be counted as having unmet need.&#13;
Since increased availability of family planning services tends to raise the&#13;
share of contraceptors using modern methods (Boulier 1984a), users of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1 12 -&#13;
inefficient methods should probably be counted among women havirng potential&#13;
demand for modern methods.&#13;
Mote9 finally9 that women relying on abortion to control fertility&#13;
and not using other methods of contraception are counted as having unmet&#13;
need. Where abortion is an important method of fertility limitation (as in&#13;
Korea)9 unmet need will be overstated9 since some women have access to an&#13;
effective method of fertility control and the method is not repo-ted.&#13;
Unmet need for spacing. Contraception is used to delay wanted births&#13;
as well as to prevent additional births altogether. Married women who wish to&#13;
delay a pregnancy9 are exposed to the risk of pregnancy9 and are not using&#13;
contraception9 have unmet need for spacing (Mortman 1982)o As with ifleasuring&#13;
unmet need for limiting purposes9 the magnitude of unmet need for spacing&#13;
depends on definitions of the population exposed to risk and of contra-&#13;
ception. In addition9 the period of delay must be defined0 I discuss this&#13;
issue first0&#13;
For a woman seeking to delay a wanted pregnancy9 the need for&#13;
contraception is greater the higher io her fecundity9 the greater the length&#13;
of desired delay9 and the more serious the consequences of failure to delay0&#13;
Goldman9 et al (19829 Table 5) report that the probability that a nonlac-&#13;
tating9 noncontracepting woman conceives within a year ranges from .46 to c58&#13;
in five Latin American countries and is 055 in Punjab9 India0     This probac&#13;
bility can be reduced substantially by the use of non-program methods such as&#13;
withdrawal and rhythm (Goldman et alt 19839 Table 4). Unless the consequences&#13;
of failing to delay a wanted pregnancy are severe9 then women seeaing delays&#13;
of less than one year have little need for family planning services0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
In calculating unmet need for contraception for spacing purposes&#13;
among women wishing to delay beyond one year, the appropriate treatment of&#13;
women who are pregnant, lactating, or using inefficient methods is the same as&#13;
for women wanting no more children. Of course, the potential benefits of&#13;
increased access to family planning services to lactating women and to users&#13;
of inefficient contraception and the potential demand for such services among&#13;
those seeking to delay a pregnancy are likely to be smaller than among&#13;
otherwise similar women wishing to terminate childbearing.&#13;
Static versus dynamic calculations of unmet need. The procedure&#13;
described above for calculating unmet need presents only a picture of the&#13;
population at a point in time. Nortman (1982) has developed a dynamic model&#13;
of the reproductive process which allows reproductive status of women to&#13;
change during the course of a year. She estimates the proportion of women&#13;
likely to have a birth in the year following the survey from information on&#13;
the reported pregnant at the time of the survey. Women having a birth during&#13;
the year are assumed to have the fertility desires (for example, desires for&#13;
additional children or desired timing of a subsequent birth) of women pregnant&#13;
at the survey date; women not projected to become pregnant are assumed to have&#13;
the same fertility desires as non-pregnant women at the time of interview.&#13;
Proportions of women expected to use contraception are projected on a basis of&#13;
patterns of contraceptive use among women falling into various pregnancy&#13;
status and fertility desire groups at the date of the survey. Her model&#13;
permits calculation of the proportion of women likely to need contraception at&#13;
any time during the year following the survey, the number of couple years of&#13;
protection needed during the year, and expected couple of years of use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
!ortman's procedure for calculating unmet need is considerably more&#13;
complesK than the static method described above, but a comparison of her&#13;
estimates of the proportions of fecund marrRed women needing contraception for&#13;
limiting and spacing purposes (Mortman 1982, Po 132)9 once they &amp;re converted&#13;
into proportions of all married women needing contraception (E3estoff and&#13;
Pebley 1983, Table 7), are not very different from the static high estimates&#13;
given in Tables 1 and 2 in the nest section egcept for Bangladesh and rural&#13;
Hestico. The high estimates given in the ne)at section assume that all&#13;
lactating women and users of inefficient methods who want no more children,&#13;
have uniset need for contraception. Total unmet needs defined as the sum of&#13;
unmet need for limiting and unmet need for spacing, derived from. Cortman's&#13;
dynamic procedure is within 5 percent of the static estimates for Colombia&#13;
(l978), Costa Rica (1978), Korea (1979), urban Nezico (1978), and Thailand&#13;
(l978). For Bangladesh (1979) and rural Mei:ico (1978), estimates of unmet&#13;
need for limiting purposes derived from the two methods are neaT..y identical9&#13;
but the dynamic procedure yields estimates of unmet need for spgeinr e.7hich are&#13;
more than twice as high as the static measure. Part of the difference can be&#13;
attributed to the fact that Nortman's estimates pertain to the proportion of&#13;
women needing contraception at any time during the yeaz following the survey&#13;
whereas the static measure assesses need at a single point in time0a The&#13;
differences in these two concepts of unm.2t need will be especially large where&#13;
fertility rates are very high, as they are in 3angladesh and rural IMezico, arii&#13;
where many women who give birth to a child in the year following the survey&#13;
are aosumed to have unmet need for contreceptioci for spacing pu?oses, as they&#13;
are in Mortman's modelo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
In short, the dynamic model is much more complex than the static&#13;
model, but appears usually to give results which are not very different from&#13;
those obtained from the simpler procedure. Given that the basic data from&#13;
which unmet need measures are calculated are not likely to be without error&#13;
and that precise estimates of unmet need are not required for most planning&#13;
purposes, the results from the static procedure are acceptable. A potential&#13;
advantage of the Nortman dynamic model is that it could be used to simulate&#13;
the consequences for unmet need of assumed changes in fertility desires and in&#13;
contraceptive use rates.&#13;
III. Estimates of unmet need for limiting in thirty-six countries&#13;
Table 1 shows estimates for the percentages of married women aged 15&#13;
to 49 wanting no more children and high and low estimates of unmet need for&#13;
limiting purposes in rural and urban areas of thirty-six developing countries&#13;
where CPS and WFS surveys were conducted. The high estimate of unmet need for&#13;
limiting is defined as the percentage of women wanting no more children who&#13;
are not pregnant, infecund, or using efficient contraceptive methods&#13;
(sterilization, pill, IUD, injection, condom, and female scientific&#13;
methods). The high estimate assumes that lactating women and users of&#13;
inefficient methods have the same unmet need as women wanting no more children&#13;
who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy and are not using any method&#13;
ofcontraception. The low estimate assumes that, among women who want no more&#13;
children, those who are breastfeeding for less than one year or using&#13;
inefficient methods would neither demand nor benefit from modern contraceptive&#13;

methods were they more readily available. Because CPS questionnaires did not&#13;
gather information on duration of breastfeeding, the proportion of women&#13;
breastfeeding for less than one year among women wanting no more children was&#13;
estimated by multiplying the proportion of lactating women wanting no more&#13;
children in the CPS survey by the ratio of all women lactating less than one&#13;
year to all lactating women obtained from an earlier WFS survey for the same&#13;
country. Since no data for Barbados or Honduras were available for&#13;
undertaking this adjustment, the low estimates of unmet need for these two&#13;
countries implicitly assume that all lactating women, regardless of duration,&#13;
have unmet need.&#13;
The median percentage of women wanting no more children in the&#13;
countries surveyed is 53 percent, but there is considerable variation among&#13;
regions (see Table 2 for a regional summary). Of the twenty-five Latin&#13;
American and Asian countries, there are only four (Honduras, Paraguay,&#13;
Indonesia, and Nepal) in which fewer than 50 percent of women want no more&#13;
children. By contrast, fewer than 50 percent of women want no more children&#13;
in three of the five Middle East and North African countries (MENA), and the&#13;
percentage is less than 30 percent in all sub-Saharan African countries.&#13;
The proportion of women wanting no more children tends to be higher&#13;
in urban than in rural areas. The median percentage wanting no more children&#13;
is 55 percent in urban areas and 51 percent in rural areas. The percentage of&#13;
women wanting to limit family size is greater in urban areas than in rural&#13;
areas in all MENA countries and in all Asian countries except Korea (80&#13;
percent of rural women versus 76 percent of urban women). Desires for family&#13;
limitation are greater in rural areas than in urban areas in about half the&#13;

Latin American countries and in four of six sub-Saharan African countries. In&#13;
these African countries the percentage of rural women wanting no more children&#13;
never differs from the urban percentage by more than 3 percent except in Sudan&#13;
where about one-third of urban, but only one-fourth of rural, women want no&#13;
more children.&#13;
The high estimate of unmet need shows substantial levels of unmet&#13;
need for contraception for limiting purposes and considerable variations&#13;
across regions (see Table 3 for a regional summary). The median value is 20&#13;
percent. Ten of the Latin American and seven of the Asian countries have&#13;
levels exceeding 20 percent. No sub-Saharan African country has unmet need&#13;
greater than 10 percent and the only country in MENA exceeding 20 percent is&#13;
Egypt. The low levels of unmet need in sub-Saharan Africa and MENA are&#13;
largely attributable to the small proportons of women wanting no more&#13;
children. There is, of course, also considerable variation in unmet need&#13;
within regions. For example, only 11 percent of women in Costa Rica have&#13;
unmet need compared to 41 percent in Peru. In Asia, unmet need ranges from 15&#13;
percent in Fiji and Indonesia to 31 percent in Sri Lanka.&#13;
The median of the low estimates of unmet need is only 10 percent,&#13;
about half the median of the high estimates. For most countries, the low&#13;
estimate is 40 to 65 percent of the high estimate. Notable exceptions are&#13;
Bangladesh, Cameroon, Guyana, Jamaica, and Nepal, where the low estimates are&#13;
more than 80 percent of the high estimates, and Peru, where the low estimate&#13;
is less than one-third of the high estimate. In Peru, nearly one-fourth of&#13;
married women wanting no more children are using inefficient methods such as&#13;
rhythm and withdrawal.&#13;

The low estimates of unmet need reveal the same regional pattern as&#13;
the high estimates although the range of variation is smaller. The percentage&#13;
of women with unmet need is no higher than 6 percent in any of the sub-Saharan&#13;
African countries and is less than 10 percent in four of the five MENA&#13;
countries. The percentage is greater than or equal to 10 percent in all of&#13;
the Asian countries and in more than half of the Latin American countries.&#13;
Excluding sub-Saharan Africa, the smallest value of the low estimate of unmet&#13;
need is 6 percent in Costa Rica and the largest value is 25 percent in&#13;
Bangladesh. The high estimates range from 11 percent in Costa Rica to 41&#13;
percent in Peru.&#13;
As judged either by the high or by the low measure, unmet need is&#13;
typically higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The median value of&#13;
unmet need for the high measure is 23 percent in rural areas and 19 percent in&#13;
urban areas. The corresponding figures for the low measure are 12 and 9&#13;
percent, respectively. Both measures show that the percentage of women with&#13;
unmet need is higher in rural than in urban areas in all Latin American&#13;
countries, except for Trinidad and Tobago, where the low estimate of urban&#13;
unmet need is only slightly higher than rural unmet need. In Asia, rural-&#13;
urban differences are small. The high measure gives differences greater than&#13;
3 percent only in Indonesia (urban 19 percent, rural 15 percent), and Thailand&#13;
(urban 11 percent, rural 19 percent). According to the low measure, rural&#13;
unmet need exceeds urban unmet need by more than 5 percent in Nepal, the&#13;
Philippines, and Thailand. Only in Pakistan does urban unmet need exceed&#13;
rural unmet need by more than 3 percent.&#13;
Both measures show relatively small differences in rural-urban&#13;
differentials in most MENA and sub-Saharan countries. Both measures indicate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 &#13;
that rural unmet need exceeds urban unmet need by about 5 percent in Egypt and&#13;
that urban unmet need exceeds rural unmnet need by about 5 percent in the&#13;
Sudan. In Syria9 the high estimate shows higher unmet need in urban areas9&#13;
but the low estimate reveals a slight excess of rural unmet need.&#13;
The rural-urban differentials in unmet need discussed above compare&#13;
the proportions of all married women having unmet need in the two areas.&#13;
Another way to look at rural-urban differentials is to compare the fractions&#13;
of women who want no more children but have unmet need. To some extent9 this&#13;
comparison reveals equity in access to contraception9 although differences in&#13;
the extent of infecundity and in motivation to avoid pregnancy may also give&#13;
rise to differences in the levels of contraceptive use. That is9 for a given&#13;
level of availability (price) of contraception9 women believing themselves to&#13;
be infecund (excluding the contraceptively sterilized) or women rflore highly&#13;
motivated to avoid an additional pregnancy are less likely to use contra-&#13;
ception than other women.&#13;
Table 5 gives estimates of women with unmet need as a percentage of&#13;
women who want no more children for each country using both the high and low&#13;
estimates of unmet need0 The median value of the percentage for the high&#13;
estimate is 37 percent0 As judged by the high estimate, more than 30 percent&#13;
of women who want no more children have unmet need in 30 of the 36 coun-&#13;
tries. The rural median is 44 percent and the urban median 34 percent0 The&#13;
rural percentage exceeds the urban percentage in 29 of 35 countries0 (There is&#13;
no rural-urban breakdown in Barbados0) The urban percentage is higher than&#13;
the rural percentage in Cameroon9 Indonesia9 and the Ivory Coast0 In&#13;
Bangladesh9 Fiji9 and Trinidad and Tobago9 the differences are one percent or&#13;

less. Rural-urban differences are widest in Latin America. In seven of the&#13;
Latin American countries, more than fifty percent of rural women wanting no&#13;
more children have unmet need, whereas only in three countries is the urban&#13;
percentage as high as 40 percent.&#13;
The low estimates of unmet need give very much the same picture,&#13;
although levels are lower. The median percentage of women having unmet need&#13;
among women who want no more children is 21 percent. The rural median is 24&#13;
percent and the urban median is 17 percent. The urban percentage is higher&#13;
than the rural percentage in six countries, and only in Cameroon and Pakistan&#13;
is the difference more than 5 percent. Rural-urban differences are largest in&#13;
Latin America, where the percentage of rural women having unmet need is&#13;
greater than 20 percent in eleven countries and is greater than 20 percent&#13;
among urban women in only four countries.&#13;
IV. Unmet need for spacing in nine countries&#13;
Table 6 gives the percentage of married women wishing to delay a&#13;
birth for at least one year and high and low estimates of unmet need for&#13;
spacing. The high estimate assumes that lactating women, users of inefficient&#13;
methods, and non-contraceptors have unmet need for spacing; the low estimate&#13;
assumes that women lactating for less than one year and users of inefficient&#13;
methods have no unmet need.&#13;
There is considerable variation in the proportion of women wishing to&#13;
delay a wanted birth in this small sample of countries. The lowest value is 4&#13;
percent (Korea) and the highest 27 percent (Costa Rica). Within countries,&#13;
urban and rural percentages are quite similar. In all cases, the percentages&#13;

differ by less than 3 percent. Only in Bangladesh is the high estimate of&#13;
unmet need above 10 percent. However, in five of the countries--Costa Rica&#13;
(1980), Honduras, Mexico, Bangladesh, and Thailand (1981)--the percentage of&#13;
women having unmet need for spacing accounts for more than one-quarter of all&#13;
unmet need (see Table 7). In three of the countries (Peru, Korea, and Nepal),&#13;
unmet need for spacing is higher in urban than in rural areas. In all&#13;
countries, the fraction of women who have unmet need among those wanting to&#13;
delay a birth is higher in rural areas.&#13;
The low estimates of unmet need for spacing are less than one-half&#13;
the high estimates in all Latin American countries and more than one-half the&#13;
high estimate in the three Asian countries. The percentage of women having&#13;
unmet need for spacing is more than 5 percent of all women in each of the&#13;
three Asian countries. In both Bangladesh and Costa Rica (1978), unmet need&#13;
for spacing accounts for more than one-third of overall unmet need when one&#13;
uses the low estimates of unmet need for both spacing and limiting.&#13;
In short, unmet need for spacing purposes is much lower than unmet&#13;
need for limiting but is a fairly important proportion of overall unmet need&#13;
in a few countries. Whether this conclusion would be altered for countries in&#13;
the MENA region or sub-Saharan Africa is an open question.&#13;
V. Conclusion&#13;
This paper has reviewed procedures for calculating unmet need for&#13;
contraception for limiting family size and for delaying wanted births and&#13;
assessed possible measurement errors and their consequences for estimating the&#13;
number of women who would benefit from increased availability of modern&#13;

methods. High and low estimates of unmet need for-contraception for purposes&#13;
of limiting family size were presented for rural and urban areas of thirty-six&#13;
developing countries and estimates of unmet need for spacing purposes for nine&#13;
countries.&#13;
In half of the countries included in the sample, the high estimate of&#13;
unmet need for limiting purposes exceeded 20 percent of married women of&#13;
childbearing age, with levels of unmet need being higher in Latin America and&#13;
Asia than in Africa or the Middle East. Unmet need measures were lower in the&#13;
latter two continents primarily because of smaller proportions of women&#13;
wanting no more children. Unmet need among rural women exceeded that of urban&#13;
women in all fourteen Latin American countries for which data were available&#13;
and in eight of the other twenty-one countries. Low estimates of unmet need&#13;
which assumed that users of traditional contraceptive methods such as&#13;
withdrawal and rhythm and women breastfeeding for less than one year would&#13;
neither benefit from nor demand modern contraception were typically about half&#13;
the magnitude of the high estimates.&#13;
The high estimate of unmet need for spacing purposes included fecund&#13;
married women wishing to delay a birth for at least one year but not using&#13;
modern contraception; the low estimate excluded from this group women using&#13;
traditional contraceptive methods or breastfeeding for less than one year.&#13;
The high estimates ranged from 3 percent of all married women of childbearing&#13;
age in Colombia and Korea to 14 percent in Bangladesh. Only in Bangladesh and&#13;
Thailand were the low estimates more than half the magnitude of the high&#13;
estimates. Levels of unmet need for spacing were similar in rural and urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30  -&#13;
areas. According to the high estimates9 unmet need for spacing accounted for&#13;
more than one-quarter of all unmet need in five of the nine Latin American and&#13;
Asian countries for which data were available.&#13;

            Evaluating unmet need for contraception :
            estimates for thirty-six developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Married women wanting no more children,
            who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy and are not using
            contraception, are defined as having unmet need for
            contraception for limiting purposes. Married women seeking
            to delay unwanted pregnancies, who are exposed to the risk
            of pregnancy, but are not using contraception, have unmet
            need for contraception for spacing purposes. This paper
            reviews procedures for calculating unmet need and assesses
            measurement errors, and their consequences, for estimating
            the number of women who would benefit from increased
            availability of modern contraceptive methods and for
            estimating the potential demand for such methods. High and
            low estimates of unmet need for contraception for purposes
            of limiting family size are presented for rural and urban
            areas of thirty-six developing countries and estimates of
            unmet need for spacing purposes for nine countries. Low
            estimates assume that women who want no more children or
            want to delay births for more than one year and have been
            breastfeeding for less than one year or are using
            traditional methods of contraception such as withdrawal or
            rhythm do not have unmet need. High estimates count these
            women as having unmet need.
