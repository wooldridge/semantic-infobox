relating to&#13;
Global Ini[astructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;

ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   CAISSE DE DEPOT ET PLAGEMENT DU QUEBEC, represented by its Senior Vice Presi lr&#13;
Private Equity and Infrastructh re and headquartered at 1000, Place Jean Paul Riopelle, Mc -In al&#13;
(Quebec) H2Z 2B3 (as an "Ac visory Partner"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DHVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPM EN&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), head quartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US \ ie&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvan&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC; 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("M GA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC C 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interl Eli: 'ial&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin, r :he&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging M arkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to :::r Ind&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic c rc vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on i! i, ng&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coor:Ii, ed&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize pr vate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robu ;t pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects anc hi is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm( r t.&#13;
(D) Governments, development fiiance institutions, donors, and private investors share an int ie! in&#13;
developing the market for priiate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand :;i:1 in&#13;
the numbers of structurally sc und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emE re ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of pri ate&#13;
investors that actively partici )ate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will be efit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowli-cig, to&#13;
find solutions to complex irfrastructure financing challenges that no single institutior c: uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure 1: 3: lity&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"). The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leverac ir Ithe&#13;
efforts of the wide range of ir stitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructh r: /ith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep ilal on,&#13;
structuring, and risk mitigatic n for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, i 31F&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported t,y the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepa o, ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure pro ects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for access irc the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pros p: ive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater IE Va ige&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular fir I  ge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interes ed in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure F a: lity&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facilit I Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended to be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set ot t ir&#13;

understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collat :z on,&#13;
they are of an indicative natura and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and A it,&#13;
other potential partners until the GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje:: i% s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to Nork together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fuither enhance their coordination, in particular by developing tI E IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establi:;hing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue tc&#13;
collaborate in developing the 31F, including but not limited to:&#13;

2.2   During the process of finaliz ng the design of the GIF, the multilateral development banl&lt;; Ii ted&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited to participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF d( sic is&#13;
finalized, additional collaborative efforts are required to develop the operational details f:i the&#13;
GIF, at all times complem nting existing efforts and facilities and building upon the s red&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the e" of&#13;
coordination between the Parties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Prelirr inary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the C IF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pr e: :s&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatic r&#13;
provision of appropriate risk r itigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial 2 n:&#13;
institutional investor engagerrent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publi,:-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer:i:1l&#13;
viability which require project )reparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastruit it&#13;
financing solutions that no sin 3le institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF eims to create a global platform to provide financial and coord ra: on&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of thi fv e&#13;
range of donor and developm Bnt finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDI&#13;
infrastructure, with the input aid ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemer : :: ild&#13;
stretch from upstream suppor on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to down stream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemen .&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset claE s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long. tor I&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilei.&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to or erate according to the following core principles, to be finalize Ju on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the irivate sector-specializing in project financing modalities t   'II&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing pub ic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure pro ects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sust inability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to b :t&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, c ,mplementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing te. ill cal&#13;
and financial resc urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul  1i1 ral&#13;
development inst tutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and fle xible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greate&#13;
leverage and adcress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resoL rces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected o involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t E&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF pa Ii, 's&#13;
are expected to fall into one c r more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wil he&#13;
considered Fundi ig Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partnurs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice z:nd support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde i&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc t&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne 's-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/ r institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as we Ia&#13;
other multilateral )r bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparat n,&#13;
optimal approach as to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inves ment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Co:ncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin,&#13;
management and use of fund -, and development of operational policies and procedures; a 1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, witl advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compoc it ci of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propc :3!( to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counci comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dire .c&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilit re&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve :i.&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wii i&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of )rojects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admir istered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicatec t :.: n&#13;
established for this purpose (Ihe GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu 1 ti n&#13;
as a coordinating body as pro ects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mov,&#13;
toward technical support and inancing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead inc \ ic jal&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemer tation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partnel&#13;
institutions, coordinated by th, GIF Management Unit in consultation with client goverrimei t;,&#13;
according to specific project r)quirements and the project origination processes. Composi i r 3f&#13;
the implementation teams mEy vary according to the need of individual projects and gover in: nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follow r g&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the GIl&#13;
partner institution 3;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-proj ,cts that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities it c&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-prcjects that require multiple parties to come together to provide&#13;
structuring, arran 3ing and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl r d )f&#13;
financial instrume nts; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial ia lity,&#13;
leverage public fL nds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s.14&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's service delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr cture investments that have global public good characteristic !: ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior cf&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnei tv &#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppo I provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with : v Iw&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and ot 1or&#13;
funding mechanisms. During he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac ii s,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr ! r ig;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PFIP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financi l1&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-i icluding in particular the management of environmental and :Ic 1l&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri cth e&#13;
projects in supporting sustain able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, eputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements  -&#13;
external implementing entitie,. under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an aporoach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc 0t 3r&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI :&#13;
Technical Partners who are eKpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
