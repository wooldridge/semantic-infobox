A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1. Countryand SectorIssues&#13;
&#13;
1.       Conditions for economic revival in West Bank Gaza (WBG) continue to be inhibited by a volatile&#13;
political and security situation. Restrictions on the movement o f people and goods, are stifling economic&#13;
activity, not least in Gaza where the Karni crossing point - the only commercial crossing point between Gaza&#13;
and Israel - has been sealed for significant parts of the past year.           In addition, the PA is facing an&#13;
unprecedented liquidity crisis brought about by a confluence of factors, including Israel's withholding of&#13;
Palestinian customs revenue, suspension of OECD-donors budget-related disbursements until the new&#13;
government meets a number o f political conditions espoused by the Quartet and the reluctance of commercial&#13;
banks to lend or provide banking services to the PA. As a result, for the past three months, the PA has been&#13;
unable to pay most recurrent costs and has not been able to make payments of public sector salaries since&#13;
March 2006 except for some limitedrecent payments to the lowest paid civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Inthe current fragile conditions, the agricultural sector (and the poultry industrywithin it) offers one&#13;
of the more secure sources o f income and nutrition for Palestinians. Data for the 2003/2004 agricultural year&#13;
put poultry production (meat and eggs) at around US$125 million, equivalent to roughly one-third of total&#13;
animal production.' At the same time, many families, especially among the poor, depend on poultry as their&#13;
most affordable source o f protein (88% o f total animal protein intake for Gazans is poultry-based2).According&#13;
to the WFP3, families in Gaza have reduced their total intake of animal protein out of economic necessity,&#13;
partially substituting poultry and eggs with significantly higher-priced beef, lamb, and fish. The lack of&#13;
affordable alternative protein sources could potentially have especially severe implications for the nutritional&#13;
status of children. The outbreak of Avian Influenza in Gaza, with its associated economic, social and&#13;
environmentalrisks,will thus compound an already fragile situation.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Providing an effective response to the onset of Avian Influenza in these circumstances is, and will&#13;
continue to be, challenging, requiring speed, flexibility and coordination o f priority actions. The Ministryof&#13;
Agriculture (MOA) does not have the capacity on its own to carry out activities throughout the WBG to&#13;
contain a spread o f the Avian Influenza. This is mainly due to in-house limitations, such as inadequate human&#13;
capacities and financial resourcesto carry out activities of such magnitude, in addition to the ministry's limited&#13;
experience in managing large-scale donor funded projects. While the institutional capacity o f the Ministry of&#13;
Health, another key agency in an effective Avian Influenza response, i s somewhat better, the current fiscal&#13;
crisis has nevertheless taken its toll. Furthermore, a protracted fiscal crisis may affect project implementation&#13;
(Le., non-payment of salaries inrelevant ministries, etc.). To summarize, the PA i s falling well short of having&#13;
the adequatecapacities andresourcesto combat an outbreak ofthe Avian InfluenzainWBG effectively.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Successfully containing the outbreak primarily depends on comprehensive culling o f poultry. In line&#13;
with WHO guidelines, already, 400,000 birds in Gaza have been culled within a three kilometer radius of&#13;
farms with positive H5N1 cases. Initially, the PA was unable to provide on its own full compensation for&#13;
owners o f the culled birds, who, on the basis of press reports, had been led to believe such compensation&#13;
would be forthcoming. Consequently, the PA suffered same loss of credibility among farmers. For example,&#13;
there were incidents confirmed by the MOA where some farmers showed resistance to the first round of&#13;
culling. This has also increased the risk that in the future farmers would be increasingly reluctant to report&#13;
suspected cases o f Avian Influenza, that they might practice unsafe culling procedures, or even sell infected&#13;

birds. Much o f the farmers' trust, however, has been restored through a recent initiative by the Russian&#13;
Government which enabled the PA to complete the compensation payments to the poultry producers who were&#13;
impacted by the outbreak. The total amount of cash payments funded by the Russian Government reached&#13;
US$1.7 million.&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement&#13;
&#13;
5.       In short, West Bank and Gaza is eligible for Bank fundingand has asked for World Bank assistance.&#13;
The Bank has a comparative advantage in providing fundingfor financing gaps insu port of the regional and&#13;
global "good" o f containing Avian Flu. According to the GPAIframework document ,West Bank and Gaza i s&#13;
                                                                                       !&#13;
eligible as a "newly-infected country with an active outbreak of avian flu among poultry but no human&#13;
infection (at the time of writing), and the existence of an appropriate program of rapid response, detection and&#13;
containment measures." Implementation and monitoring arrangements which the international and donor&#13;
agencies, including the Bank, could support are under discussion but not yet inplace.&#13;
&#13;
6.       HPAIcontrol programs require a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate socio-economic issues with&#13;
technical and regulatory policies. In this context, the Bank recognizes the key role currently played by UN&#13;
technical agencies through the UNInteragency Framework. The Bank's comparative advantage is its ability to&#13;
mobilize financial resources as well as to introduce international best practices within a framework of essential&#13;
multi-disciplinary approaches. The Bank is currently working with technical counterparts and the donor&#13;
community to ensure that all activities complement the National Plan.&#13;
&#13;
B. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. ProjectDevelopmentObjectivesandKeyIndicators&#13;
&#13;
7.       Consistent with the GPAI, the project development objective i s to achieve a minimum level of spread&#13;
o f AI to humans through better preparedness, control, and response; and achieve a minimum level o f income&#13;
loss o ftargeted farmers through compensation.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Thiswould bemeasuredby:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Sustained preventionrate among high-riskgroups;&#13;
     0   Reduced infection rate o f HPAI inpoultry; and&#13;
     0   A targeted percentageof farmer's income loss compensated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Project Components&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: AnimalHealthand Veterinarv ServicesWS%5,860,000)&#13;
&#13;
9.       This component will support the preparation and implementationofHPAIpreventionand containment&#13;
activities inthe poultry sector. Inthe design of this component particular attention has been paid to consistency&#13;
and coordination between the urgent short-term project activities that will be financed under a stand-alone&#13;
US$3 million grant from the UNTF Grant, and the longer term activities to be conducted under this Project, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Paragraph44 (ii).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Surveillanceand DiagnosticCapacity. (US$680,000) Activities include: (a) training of field staff on&#13;
        surveillance and monitoring; (b) provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for field&#13;
        technicians directly exposed to the risk of contamination during surveillance; (c) vaccines; (d)&#13;
         equipping of a veterinary laboratory in Gaza including supply of reagents and laboratory disposables,&#13;
         as well as the upgrading of the capacity of the existing laboratory in WB;          (e) training for lab&#13;
        technicians; (f)and some activities in community awareness and social mobilization (mainly targeted&#13;
         at persons along the poultry production line). Potential activities may also include the provision of&#13;
         appropriate quarantine measures and the development of a routine collection and update of&#13;
         epidemiological data.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Culling and Disposal. (US$380,000) This sub-component will support culling and preparationand&#13;
         disinfection of disposal sites and poultry farms, plus the provision of technical assistance to PA&#13;
         counterparts on culling proceduresand data collection.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Compensation for IncomeLoss. (US$4,800,000) This component will provide technical support for&#13;
         the compensation committee and a proportion of the compensationfunding. All the necessary legal,&#13;
         operational and institutional arrangements for carrying out this sub-component will be developed in&#13;
         the first few monthsof implementationthroughthe AITF grant to UNagencies (UNTF Grant).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comuonent2: HumanHealth (US$2,907,000)&#13;
&#13;
10.      This component will support activities aimed at preventing the spread of the AI virus to humans.&#13;
Particular attention has been paid in the design of the component to ensure consistency and coordination&#13;
between the urgent short-term project activities to be conducted under the UNTF Grant and the long-term&#13;
activities which will be conducted under this Project. The following activities will be supported under this&#13;
Component:&#13;
&#13;
         Prevention&amp; Human Safety (US$482,000): through (a) the protection of medical and field staff and&#13;
         other highly exposed groups involved in identification/surveillanceof the disease. Adequate resources&#13;
         will be allocated for Protective clothing (PPE), Prophylaxis treatment, disinfection materials, and&#13;
         vaccination against seasonal human influenza; and (b) social mobilization and raising public&#13;
         awareness inthe community.&#13;
&#13;
         StrengtheningPublic Health Surveillance Systems (US$75,000): To assess risks to public health&#13;
         and to guide preventive interventions, information is needed on the extent of influenza infection in&#13;
         animals and humans, on circulating viruses, and on other priority infectious diseases. To this end, the&#13;
         project would support strengthening the capacity of existing laboratories. This will include the&#13;
         provision of equipment necessary for specimen collection, transportation, and testing. It will also&#13;
         support upgradingof the diagnosticcapacity of existing laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
         Health SystemResponse(US$2,350,000): While precisefigures are difficult to estimate, the burden&#13;
         on the health system is likely to be considerable. With the present situation, the potential of the HPAI&#13;
         virus to become transmissible among humans is of serious concern. Thus, building an effective&#13;
         national public health response would be part of an integrated national plan to bring proven&#13;
         interventionsquickly up to a nationwide scale. Activities under this sub-componentwill include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             -   Vaccinations: Inthe event of an avian influenza pandemic(when vaccines become available),&#13;
                 funding will be made available for implementing a detailed logistical (procurement and&#13;
                 distribution) plan for the vaccinationoftargeted priority groups.&#13;
             -   Drug Therapy: The use of anti-viral drugs will be part of the approach to contain an avian&#13;
                 influenza pandemic and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, support will be&#13;
                 provided for the purchase of Tami flu (antiviral drug). Priority would be given to population&#13;
                 groups most exposed to immediate risk. The project would support the use of the anti-viral&#13;
                 drugs for: (a) post exposure; and (b) extendedprophylaxis;&#13;
             -   Medical services: Based on the needs assessment which will be conductedunder the UNTF&#13;
                 Grant, assistance will be provided to the health care system for preparedness to provide&#13;
                 optimal medical care and maintain essential community services. Strengthened clinical care&#13;
                 capacitycould be achievedthrough establishingspecializedunitsin selected hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
ComDonent3: PublicAwareness and EnvironmentalManaPement(US$519,900)&#13;
&#13;
11.      Current assessments indicatethere are at least two areas of activity where contingency funds will need&#13;
to meet evolving needs: (a) further activities on public awareness and information which may have not been&#13;
addressed under components 1 &amp; 2; and (b) implementationof an environmentalrisk management plan.&#13;
&#13;
(a) PublicAwareness and Information&#13;
&#13;
12.      A coordinatedawareness and information campaign is needed to target the general public, especially&#13;
the rural population and areas of commonbackyardpoultry breeding(high-risk areas). Some public awareness&#13;
activities will be carried out under Component 2 with oversight from the MOH. The MOA also plans to print&#13;
out and distribute leaflets and brochures (under Component 1) targeting poultry producers. Additional&#13;
activities not accounted for under Components 1 and 2 will be financed under Component 3. The PIU will&#13;
retain a communicationsspecialist/agency to prepare a public awareness strategy in consultation with key UN&#13;
agencies andNGOs (UNICEF, PARC, etc). Communicationmethodscould include:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Public meetings targeting women and farmers on means of protecting humans from AI. This may&#13;
         include field and houseto house visits;&#13;
&#13;
         Creation of a Hot line -emergency telephones where specializedveterinarianson call will be provided&#13;
         with basic instrumentsand clothing neededfor emergency checkups; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Mid-termevaluationworkshop.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Implementationof EnvironmentalManagementPlan&#13;
&#13;
13.      This sub-component will implement measures as described in the Environmental Management Plan&#13;
(EMP) which will be developedas part of the activities under the UNTF and ofthe Environmental Assessment&#13;
(see safeguards section). The EA/EMP will be developed following the "Interim Guidelines for Managing&#13;
Potential Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-Assisted Avian Influenza Control Projects",&#13;
Quality Assurance and Compliance Unit, April 2006.&#13;
&#13;
14.      These measures may include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   implementation o f sound culling methods;&#13;
    0   safe disposal of culled birds and disposal o f farm waste (manure, eggs, feathers, contaminated&#13;
        equipment, etc);&#13;
        transport of infectious materials and dead birds;&#13;
    0   appropriate landfill site management;&#13;
    0   safe disposal of medical waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. ProjectCosts and FinancingInstruments&#13;
&#13;
15.     Total project costs have been estimated at U S 1 0 million financed from the Trust Fund for Gaza and&#13;
West Bank (TFGWB). An additional US$3 million from the Avian and Human Influenza Facility Trust Fund&#13;
will be implemented through the UN agencies for urgent prevention and preparedness activities to be&#13;
implemented over an initial 12-month period. Cash compensation for the farmers affected by the mandatory&#13;
culling has already paid for an aggregate of US$1.7 million through a contribution from the Russian&#13;
Government. Other co-financiers, such as USAID, the EC and Norway, are expected to contribute through the&#13;
UNInteragency Framework either financially or inkind.&#13;
&#13;
16.      The WBG Country Financing Parameter (CFP) were approved on March 14, 2005 and made the&#13;
financing o f VAT and other reasonable taxes eligible under grant financing. Accordingly and, in line with the&#13;
CFP financing eligibility criteria, the WBG CFP was effectively applied from August 1, 2005 and all existing&#13;
Credit / Grant Agreements were amendedto reflect the new guidelines.Furthermore, the CFP has been applied&#13;
to all new operations ever since. The. Ministry of Finance will therefore maintain the same policies as applied&#13;
to existing projects for VAT, import duties and taxes on goods and services to the Project.&#13;
&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
1. Overall ProjectOrganizationand Management&#13;
&#13;
17.      Overall responsibility for overseeing and coordinating institutional and implementation arrangements&#13;
will be vested with the National Emergency Committee for Avian Influenza Control (NCAIC) established&#13;
since March 24, 2006. NCAIC is chaired by the Minister of Health and comprises the Deputy Minister of&#13;
Agriculture as vice-chairman and Senior Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry o f Local&#13;
Government, PEA, and the Poultry Professional Association. The NCAIC will provide policy guidance and&#13;
coordination at the national level to oversee the implementation of the Project. The Committee will be&#13;
responsible for ensuring coordination and linkages across relevant agencies with international partners and for&#13;
guiding and monitoring project implementation at the central level. It will review and approve annual work&#13;
programs (AWPs) and ensure that recommendations from the auditors (Project and Compensation Fund) are&#13;
complied with in a timely manner (see Appendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
18.      The primary implementing agencies (IAs) for the Project's physical activities will be the Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). UN Agencies, local and international NGOs, and&#13;
other public agencies and departments would also carry out specific activities as required.Both ministrieswill&#13;
appoint Component Coordinators (CCs) and senior representatives, responsible for coordinating activities&#13;
within the respective ministries. The component coordinators will be the counterparts o f the Agricultural and&#13;
Health Specialists secondedto the PIU as full staff to ensurethe overall technical coherence o fthe project. The&#13;
CCs will report to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and work with staff and consultants at the PIU as&#13;
well as in the field under their respective ministries supporting the development and organization o f project&#13;
activities and the M&amp;E o f said activities (see Appendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. InstitutionalArrangementsfor Implementation&#13;
&#13;
19.     The Project will provide financial and technical support for project management and coordination and&#13;
for M&amp;E. The PIU will be entrusted, under the overall guidance of the NCAIC, with day-to-day&#13;
implementation, supervision and monitoring o f project activities. It will also be responsible for coordination of&#13;
project activities, technical assistance and training, as well as the fiduciary tasks of procurement and financial&#13;
management. Finally, the PIU will be responsible for consolidating the Annual Work Programs (AWPs),&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and annual financial statements, Procurement Planning and progress&#13;
reports as well as the coordination of the financial audit. It will also provide fiduciary and technical support to&#13;
the implementingagencies and facilitate the work of the CCs.&#13;
&#13;
20.     CCs will be appointed in both MOA and MOH. They will coordinate and oversee project activities&#13;
within their respective ministry and associated institutions as well as with other relevant government&#13;
departments, NGOs and Donors so as to ensure effective inter-agency collaboration. The CCs will also be&#13;
responsible for the preparation of the AWPs as well the collection and organization of other financial&#13;
information and data on their respective project components for transmission to the PIU. This data will be used&#13;
as inputs for the quarterly and annual progress reports and FMRs. The CCs will be assisted by staff and, as&#13;
necessary, consultants, who would support planning and implementation of activities as well as M&amp;E of&#13;
project activities in both ministries. To facilitate Project management, a Project Operational Manual (POM)&#13;
will be prepared by negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
3. FinancialManagementand Procurement&#13;
&#13;
21.     To mitigate fiduciary risks and to respond to the emergency nature of the project, it has been agreed&#13;
that a self-contained Project Implementation Unit for the Avian Influenza Prevention and Control Project will&#13;
be set up to oversee day-to-day implementation, supervision and monitoring of project activities. The PIUwill&#13;
also be responsible for coordination of project activities, technical assistance and training, as well as the&#13;
fiduciary tasks of procurement and financial management. For reasons of efficiency, appropriate oversight and&#13;
better integration within the PA's administrative structure, it has been agreed to anchor the PIU at the M O H&#13;
since the Minister of Health is the Chairman of the National Emergency Committee for Avian Influenza&#13;
Control (NCAIC).&#13;
&#13;
22.     The PIUwill be headedby a Project Coordinator who will report directly to the NCAIC chaired by the&#13;
M O H on policy matters and all technical and operational details concerning overall Project implementation.&#13;
The PIUwill include, in addition to the regular fiduciary staff for financial management and procurement, high&#13;
level experts in agriculture, health, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E),outreach, etc. The PIU will report to the&#13;
MoF in compliance with the principlesand procedures of Public FinancialManagement in WBG as definedby&#13;
the Organic BudgetLaw, financial directives, and operational decrees applicable to ministries.Inthat vein, the&#13;
MOF will retain signing and processing responsibilities over the withdrawal applications. To ensure that West&#13;
Bank i s fully covered, a branch office will be maintained at the M O H in West Bank with up to three technical&#13;
staff who will coordinate with the main PIU in the Gaza.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The PIU will need to be strengthened to meet the Project's implementation requirements. It will be&#13;
necessaryto add a monitoring and evaluation expert and an outreach specialist to the current staff complement.&#13;
Finally, a tailor-made training program will be provided at an early stage for the existing finance and&#13;
procurement specialists. In the case of procurement, the services of a procurement consultant(s) or&#13;
procurement agent will be required to ensure appropriate overall administration, procurement and financial&#13;
management o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24.      The capacity-building of the PIU will be gradually strengthened through the envisaged grant from&#13;
AITF for immediate implementation of critical activities through the UNDP which will serve as&#13;
implementation agency with other expert UN agencies (such as the FA0 and WHO) as part of the Avian and&#13;
Human Influenza Facility Trust Fund Grant (UNTF Grant). This strengthening will include, inter alia: (a)&#13;
backstopping the PIU procurement specialist in the preparation o f the Procurement Plan and on-the-job&#13;
training; (b) assisting the PIU Financial staff in meeting the Administrator's financial reporting requirements;&#13;
and (c) finalization of the Project Operational Manual (POM).&#13;
&#13;
25.      FinancialManagement.An assessment of the PIU's financial management capacity was completed&#13;
in May 2006. The assessment recommended to strengthenthe existing capacity through additional training&#13;
and technical backstopping by a qualified financial management specialist(s) which will allow the PIU to&#13;
adequately support the implementation of the proposed project and meet the IDA financial reporting&#13;
requirements in accordance with the requirements o f OP 10.02. The PIU will maintain a good financial&#13;
management system consisting of proper accounting books, a reliable and functioning internal control system&#13;
and competent and experienced accounting and financial staff.&#13;
&#13;
26.      The Compensation Fund for which a Presidential Protocol was issued is operated by a national&#13;
committee chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture and comprising the General Directors o f MOA and&#13;
representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministryo f Planning and the Ministryof Finance. The strategy&#13;
issued by the committee was reviewed and found in need of further strengthening to improve its functioning,&#13;
the flow of funds, the management of the compensation of fund in the commercial bank, the methods of&#13;
payment (checks vs bank transfers), etc. In particular, the internal control system, proposed fund flow&#13;
arrangements and oversight arrangements need to be better articulated for greater transparency and&#13;
accountability. The flow of funds under this sub-component will only begin after the IDA is satisfied with the&#13;
existinginternal control system, fund-flow procedures and oversight arrangements. The financial management&#13;
procedures established for the Compensation Fundwill be described inthe Project Operation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
27.      The PIU will be responsible for the financial management aspects of the Project. To that end, it will&#13;
prepare and issue the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on the basis of information and data provided&#13;
monthly by the component coordinators at the MOA, M O H and all other implementing agencies. The FMRs&#13;
will consist of four tables namely: (a) Sources and Application o f Funds; (b) Use of Funds by Project&#13;
Categories/Activities; (c) Physical Progress Report - output; and (iv) Procurement Monitoring report -&#13;
narratives and tables. In addition, the PIU is also expected to produce a general a reconciliation o f the Special&#13;
account (SA), a progress report on project implementation with an analysis o f variances between planned&#13;
versus actual, and physical versus financial. A sample o f FMRs is included inthe POM. The PIU will submit&#13;
the FMRsto the IDA within 45 days ofthe endofthe relevant quarter.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Withdrawal of funds will be made based on disbursement methods such as reimbursement and&#13;
replenishments of the SA with Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Special commitments and direct payments&#13;
with full supporting documentation will also be allowed. The project's annual financial statements, along with&#13;
SOEs, the SA and the Compensation Fund will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and&#13;
recruited on a competitive basis. The audit will be conducted in accordance internationally accepted auditing&#13;
standards. The audit report would be submitted to IDA no later than six months following the closing of the&#13;
fiscal year under audit.&#13;
&#13;
29.      Procurement. An assessment o f the procurement capacity o f the PIU was conducted in May, 2006,&#13;
as part o f the appraisal mission. The assessment determined that the procurement capacity of the PIU needs to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be strengthened to meet the implementation requirements under the Avian Influenza Prevention and Control&#13;
Project. To this end, the PIU will be supported through the services o f Procurement Consultant(s) or a&#13;
Procurement Agent to ensure an appropriate procurement management o f the project. It is also envisaged that&#13;
the PIU will benefit from capacity-building through the grant that will be made available under the Avian&#13;
Influenza Trust Fund(AITF) to finance emergency activities.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Procurement of works, goods and services required for the activities to be financed under the project&#13;
shall be undertaken in accordance with the procedures set forth inthe Bank "Guidelines - Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 (the Procurement Guidelines). Similarly, the selection and&#13;
employment of consultant services shall be governed by the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (the Consultant Guidelines).&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     A Procurement Plan (PP) for project implementation covering the initial 12-month period of project&#13;
implementation will be prepared before negotiations. The PP will define the list o f goods, works, and services&#13;
to be procured duringthe initial period and their value, the method o f procurement, thresholds for the Bank's&#13;
prior review and the timetable to carry out the procurement. The PP will be updated annually, or as required, to&#13;
reflect the project's actual implementationneeds and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The procurement procedures and Standard Bidding Documents to be used for each procurement&#13;
method, as well as model contracts for works, goods and consultant services, will be presented in the Project&#13;
Operational Manual (POM).&#13;
&#13;
4. Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
33.      Retroactive financing will not be available under this project since the PA does not have the required&#13;
resources to finance emergency activities. However, a grant of US$3.0 million will be made available under&#13;
the Avian Influenza Trust Fund (AITF) for emergency activities to ensure the implementation of necessary&#13;
measures for surveillance, to minimize the risk of HPAI spread to animal and human populations and to&#13;
strengthen the PIU. This would entail the financing of the most critical start-up activities by various UN&#13;
agencies, including launching the compensation payment process, acquiring testing equipment, raising&#13;
awareness, safely disposing of birds, and decontaminating infected areas. The grant would also cover project-&#13;
related operating costs and consultant services for finalizing the compensation procedures and training the&#13;
fiduciary staff of the PCU. The said resources would be managed by UNDP in consultation with the PA.&#13;
Regarding procurement, the Bank will ensure that it i s carried out in compliance with the requirements under&#13;
"IDA Consultants Guidelines" and "IDA Guidelinesfor Procurement ofGoods and Works".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoringand Evaluation of OutcomedResults&#13;
&#13;
34.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) will be the responsibility of the PIU with input from each&#13;
implementing agency. In addition to progress reporting, regular PIU staff will be responsible for consolidating&#13;
the Annual Work Programs (AWPs), FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs) and Procurement Planning. M&amp;E&#13;
activities and will be strengthened by the recruitmenthecondmentof additional staff/consultants, as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Monitoring implementation progress in an emergency project of this nature will require continuous&#13;
and systematic reviews of the various activities. M&amp;Eactivities are intendedto: (a) measure input, output, and&#13;
outcome indicators (see Appendix 2); (b) provide regular and up-to-date information on the progress towards&#13;
meeting the interim activities' benchmarks and the overall Project objective; (c) alert the implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

partners to implementation problems and provide a basis on which performance could be improved; and (d)&#13;
determine whether the relevant stakeholdersare respondingas expected.&#13;
&#13;
36.     The findings of M&amp;Ewill be reflected inthe quarterly and annual progress reports (at mid-term) to be&#13;
prepared and submitted by the PIU. Accordingly, progress reporting will reflect progress under works done,&#13;
goods procured, technical assistance, performance indicators, and FMRs. Reporting will also cover issues&#13;
identified during implementation and the strategies and actions proposed to resolve such issues that affect&#13;
progress. The fourth quarterly report of the first year will be an annual mid-term report covering progress&#13;
during the past year. A Final Completion Report will be preparedand will cover the progress achieved since&#13;
effectiveness, evaluationof outcomes, andthe lessons learned.&#13;

National Authority who now meets the eligibility requirements for participating in the GPAI (Country&#13;
Eligibility Criteria under the GPAI). Specific provisions have been developed to meet the standard&#13;
requirements covering organization and staffing, as well management, procurement and financial&#13;

&#13;
D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1.       Economicand FinancialAnalyses&#13;
&#13;
38,      Production of broiler and layer sectors in Gaza in 2003/4 was valued at US$42.S5million. The Gazan&#13;
poultry sector's value-added, after input deductions, is estimated at around US$22 million6. Without the&#13;
project, it i s expected that avian influenza would force the Gazan poultry sector to remain inactive in the long&#13;
term and that this income stream would be lost. With the project, the sector i s expected to return to its current&#13;
level o f value-added within two or three years. A project investment o f US$10 million i s economically&#13;
justified inorder to restore an income stream of US$22 millionper year after two to three years.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Assuming that 5% of the Gazan population would be exposed to infected poultry during an&#13;
uncontrolled poultry epidemic, it is estimated that around 2,000 human hospitalizations and 300 human deaths&#13;
would ensue'. The project would avert these health impacts.&#13;
&#13;
40.      Poultry rearing plays a key role in household livelihoods and female incomes in Gaza, given that&#13;
Israeli restrictions and social customs limit access to formal employment. According to Esim and Kuttab&#13;
(2002)*, approximately one-half o f Palestinian women overall have had long-term involvement in poultry-&#13;
rearing.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Environmentaland Social Issuesand Safeguard Policies&#13;
&#13;
41.      The project has been classified as a category B Project since it involves moderate environmental&#13;
impacts which can be managed during project implementation. The project triggers OP 4.01 on Environment&#13;

Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management. The safeguard issues which pertain to the Project are: (a)&#13;
selection and implementation of culling methods; (b) selection and implementation of disposal methods for&#13;
culled poultry and associated waste; (c) safe disposal o f medical waste; and (d) mitigating the negative&#13;
economic impacts of disease-inducted death and/or mandated culling o f poultry on small-scale and backyard&#13;
poultry producers.&#13;
&#13;
42.      OP 4.09 on Pest Management: The procurement of any pesticide will be contingent on an assessment&#13;
o f the nature and degree of associated risks, taking into account the proposed use and intended users. The&#13;
Project will require that any pesticide it finances be manufactured, packaged, labeled, handled, stored,&#13;
disposed of, and applied accordingto standards acceptable to the Bank. The Bank does not finance formulated&#13;
products that fall in WHO classes IA and IB, or formulations o f products in Class 11, if (a) the country lacks&#13;
restrictions on their distribution and use; or (b) they are likely to be used by, or be accessible to, lay personnel,&#13;
farmers, or others without training, equipment, and facilities to handle, store, and apply these products&#13;
properly.&#13;
&#13;
43.      The project will not finance activities which would trigger OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, e.g.,&#13;
selected disposal sites, landfills and burial pits will be on public land rather than private sites to avoid land&#13;
expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
44.      The project will be processed under OP8.50 and the first activity o f this project will be the&#13;
development of an EMP, which will be disclosed inthe country and in the Bank's InfoShop.&#13;
&#13;
45.      The proposed investments in laboratory facilities, equipment and staff training will improve the&#13;
effectiveness and safety of avian influenza and testing procedures by meeting international standards by the&#13;
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Whatever medical waste is generated in health care facilities&#13;
and waste from the animal health component will be managed usingexisting country guidelines. The country&#13;
project will also support updating these guidelines, training health care workers to manage medicinal waste&#13;
following these guidelines and the purchase of equipment for the proper handling and disposal of medical&#13;
waste in selected facilities. This provision would be included inthe project operationalmanual (or equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
46.      Overall, the Project would assist government entities to develop a strategy for managing future&#13;
emerging and re-emerging disease outbreaks. As such, the project will improve environmental and social&#13;
safeguards in the following areas: (a) mainstreaming environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures&#13;
for the culling and disposal of animals and waste during an outbreak, in particular by adopting OIE standards&#13;
aligned with WHO procedures and recommendations, and improving bio-medical-waste management systems&#13;
in health facilities and laboratories; (b) financing safe culling and disposal options; and (c) development of&#13;
compensation policies for poultry farmers affected by future outbreaks.&#13;

&#13;
47.     Since the project supports investments for the culling and disposal of carcasses and laboratory waste,&#13;
an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared. The EMP will be developed following the&#13;
"Interim Guidelines for Managing Potential Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-Assisted&#13;
Avian Influenza Control Projects", Quality Assurance and Compliance Unit, April 2006. The EMP will cover&#13;
the selection o f appropriate culling methods, clean-up of animal waste from infected and culled poultry, and&#13;
selection and management of disposal facilities. The scope o f this EMP will be specified during the initial&#13;
period o f Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
48.     The disclosure of the EMP in the country and InfoShop will be a condition of disbursement for the&#13;
implementation o f culling and disposal activities. On the conditions of disbursement for the compensation&#13;
component, any conditions will apply for future culling, not past culling, with the conditionality applying only&#13;
to the completion and operation of the EMP.&#13;
&#13;
SocialAspects&#13;
&#13;
49.     The social impacts of the project, both positive and negative, will require close monitoring. While no&#13;
social safeguard policies are likely to be triggered, sensitivity to the political and security context (consistent&#13;
with 0.P 2.30: Development Cooperation and Conflict) would be prudent. In line with the MNA Regional&#13;
Social Development Strategy, the project design will include consultations with affected populations in&#13;
planning and decision-making on the AI response, including these beneficiaries' accountability to achieve&#13;
results. In particular, the management of the compensation activity (under the animal health component) will&#13;
requireattention to social impacts. The inclusionof a public awareness and information component will allow&#13;
corrective and mitigation measuresagainst social risks.&#13;
&#13;
50.     Inregional terms, the potential collaborationwith Israel and other neighbors offers a rare opportunity&#13;
to buildpeaceful cooperation and linkswhich mighthave broader payoffs.&#13;

                             Appendix 1: Internationaland CountryBackground&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Overall CountryImpactAssessment&#13;
&#13;
51.      As of early April, sporadic outbreaks of avian flu in both Gaza and Israel have put authorities and&#13;
civilians on alert, albeit with different levels of response and readiness.According to FAO/WHOreports, there&#13;
have been confirmed cases from eight locations in Gaza, with several other suspected cases under&#13;
investigation. There were also eight confirmed cases from Israel, all inareas close to Gaza or the West Bank,&#13;
and one case in an Israeli settlement located within the West Bank. By the end o f April 2006, preventive&#13;
culling of a target of 400,000 chickens in 45 farms was carried out by the M O A in Gaza (approximately 20%&#13;
o f Gaza poultryg). Although there remains some ambiguity regarding the culling process actually followed",&#13;
the PA's stated policy was to comply with international practice of cullingwithin a three kmzone o f outbreaks&#13;
(OIE and FA0 Guidelines).&#13;
&#13;
52.      Further assessment has been difficult due to lack of access, and conflicting information emanating&#13;
from different international and ministerial sources. However, the extent of the risk is clear. According to the&#13;
MOA, there are currently 2,252 poultry keepers (commercial farms) in the West Bank with an annual&#13;
population of 25 million broilers and 1,100 commercial poultry farms in Gaza with an annual population of&#13;
around 10 million broilers, plus widespread domestic household rearing o f birds (chickens, pigeons, geese,&#13;
etc., in backyards and on rooftops). (See documents in the project file for poultry statistics from the MOA).&#13;
Given Gaza's small geographic size and the widespread dispersion of poultry, it would not take many&#13;
outbreaks for the three km culling zones to cover the entire area and bird population. Moreover, although&#13;
suspected human cases of avian flu have thus far tested negative, due to Gaza's high population density&#13;
(around 4,000 per sq km, among the world's highest), the potential risk of human contagion is heightened&#13;
because of the close proximity of large populations to any infected poultry. Indeed, the possible impact of&#13;
further significant outbreak in Gaza, as well as the proximity of already confirmed outbreaks to Israel, Egypt&#13;
and Jordan puts the whole region at risk if it is not handled quickly and properly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Country Strategyinthe Contextof the GPAI&#13;
&#13;
53.      A presidential decree was issued early 2006 establishing the Avian Influenza National High&#13;
Contingency Committee headed by the Minister of Health and includingmembers from different ministries&#13;
and relevant organizations (MOH, MOA, MOF, MOEHE, MOSA, Environment Quality Authority (EQA), the&#13;
Union of Poultry Farmers, and NGOs). This committee was established in order to reinforce the Palestinian&#13;
National Plan for Pandemic Influenza that was formulated in late 2005 and headed by the MOH. The Plan,&#13;
which remains in draft form, sets up the responsibilities, actions and mechanism o f work. The plan i s based&#13;
around a set o f common objectives, namely:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

         Strengthening the coordination and communication with the international community and mainly the&#13;
        neighboring countries.&#13;
         Securing funds for implementing the neededactivities.&#13;
        Improvingthe capacity of the central public health laboratories (CPHL).&#13;
        Ensuring all governmental departments, health care facilities have developed and exercised the&#13;
        preparednessand response plans.&#13;
         Providing guidance to the private sector and public on preparednessand response, in conjunction with&#13;
        the government and local authorities.&#13;
&#13;
54.      The M O A has also prepared the National Avian Influenza Control and Eradication, with the main&#13;
objective of controlling the disease through an active, programmed surveillance system by developing the&#13;
capacity for early detection and containment of the virus, promoting education and awareness among farmers,&#13;
and facilitating coordination and information exchange among the MOH and the regional and international&#13;
organizations. This National Plan has been divided into chronological phases, with Phase 1laying out the basis&#13;
for implementing active surveillance measures, and Phase 2 the implementation o f effective containment&#13;
measures in the case of confirmed outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
55.      In an attempt to translate the National Plan described above, the MOA formed the Avian Influenza&#13;
Control and Eradication Plan Technical Committee headed by the Veterinary Services and Animal Health&#13;
Department. The mandate of this Committee is to supervise and evaluate the implementations of field&#13;
activities related to the control and eradication elements o f the National Plan, evaluate the epidemiological&#13;
status of Avian Influenza in WBG, and to determine the requirements for the surveillance and control.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Due to the inability of the PA ministries to provide the requisite funds necessary to implement the&#13;
above plans, none o f the plans have been actually executed. Instead PA ministries have been limited in their&#13;
response to only the most critical surveillance and awareness activities, with little, if any, funds available to&#13;
contain any possible occurrence o f a new outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
3. Country Responseto the A I Emergency&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Overall Coordination&#13;
&#13;
57.      Clearly, the PA is seriously constrained in its ability to address AI, largely due to international&#13;
response to the transition in government.        Despite this handicap, coordination between the Palestinian&#13;
ministries dealing primarily with the virus (MOH and MOA) as well as with relevant regional and&#13;
international organizations has been remarkably efficient, with the M O H taking the lead. The AI National&#13;
Committee (described above) coordinates development and communication of policies, assessment reports,&#13;
protocols and guidelines, as well as follow-up measures to fulfill the national plan. Although brochures and&#13;
telephone hotlines have been set up for both human and animal health inquiries, a stronger public awareness&#13;
and communications campaign i s neverthelessrequired(see below).&#13;
&#13;
58.      This committee's role has beenreinforced by (i)a task force chaired by FA0with representation from&#13;
the WB, UNICEF, WHO, UNRWA, EC, M O A &amp; M O H and (ii)regional cooperation whereby Israelis,&#13;
Palestinians and Jordanians are in close communication, sharing information and experience, in particular&#13;
through an initiative under the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance (MECIDS)".&#13;
&#13;
11This is an NGO initiative was calledfor by Search for CommonGroundOrganization, basedinJerusalem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59.     As partofthe internationalresponse, the UN,ledbyUNDP and inpartnershipwith other UNagencies&#13;
including FAO, WHO, and UNICEF, has prepared an InteragencyFrameworkfor the Avian Influenza and&#13;
Preparedness Responsein order to coordinate the individualefforts of each specialized agency in a systematic&#13;
collective approach for assistingthe PA in its immediate and longer term needsto bothmitigatethe epidemic&#13;
andto reducethe threat of a humanpandemic. Fivespecific objectivesare laid out:&#13;
&#13;
            Containment: Containing current outbreaks and preventing further outbreaks by surveillance,&#13;
            early detection and containment at source through urgent, intense and sustained interventions&#13;
            designedto preventthe virus from spreadingor beingtransmittedto humans;&#13;
            Mitigation: Mitigatingthe negative impact o f Avian Influenzaon the general public's nutritional&#13;
            status and food security, by providing humanitarian assistance in the form of food aid and&#13;
            livelihoodrecovery;&#13;
            CapacityDevelopment: Supportingthe veterinary and human health surveillanceand diagnostic&#13;
            services;&#13;
            Revitalization:Developinga long-term strategy to help the poultry industry recover from the&#13;
            damage; and&#13;
            Preparedness: Improvingnationalpandemic preparedness for containingand responding to any&#13;
            humanpandemicthat might emerge.&#13;
&#13;
60.     Portions of the Bank's resources will be channeled through the UN Interagency Frameworkfor the&#13;
implementation of those urgent activities in which the UN system has a comparative advantage in terms of&#13;
adequatecapacityandmobility to carry out immediatetasks.&#13;
&#13;
4.2 Animal Health&#13;
&#13;
61.     Generally,the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has been less well-preparedbut has reacted to specific&#13;
outbreaks-preparednessfundinggoes largelyto MOH, while MOA is increasinglyconstrained by inadequate&#13;
funding. As described earlier, the initial culling efforts carriedout by the MOA staff in Gaza (400,000 birds)&#13;
and in the West Bank (approximately5,500 birds belongingto 47 poultry breeders) have been carriedout in&#13;
compliance with the 3 km zoning recommendations. Initially, the MOA had envisaged carrying out a 100%&#13;
slaughter inthe West Bank (allowingbirdsto be frozen andusedfor food), butthis hasnot beenapplieddue to&#13;
limitedresourcesthat MOA prefersto conserve for possible cullingrequirementsthat mightemergeinthe near&#13;
future. Nevertheless, 100%slaughtering inthe West Bankremains an option should conditionsallow. As part&#13;
of its farmer-awareness and education campaign, MOH has already prepared and distributed approximately&#13;
20,000 brochures and 5,000 posters among poultry farmers in the West Bank. In addition, some interactive&#13;
awareness sessions at farms visited duringthe sampling and culling process have been carriedout with farm&#13;
owners and employees. The PA has expressed itsconcernto partners and donors about the needfor immediate&#13;
funding for compensation in order to encourage further culling; additional funding is also required for&#13;
necessary operational and recurrent expenditure in the areas of surveillance, culling and disposal, and to&#13;
address any new cycle of infections.&#13;
&#13;
62.     MOA has also put in place a strategy for farmer in order to encourage farmers to report suspected&#13;
cases, to encourage farmers to perform the culling process, and to compensate farmers on their capital loss.&#13;
The strategy set out as a target group all farmers whose birds were culled duringthe culling periodbased on&#13;
the records ofthe MOA andthe technicalteams inthe field. MOA considersfarmer compensationto be one of&#13;
its mainpriorities, and lists of farmers and compensationamountshavebeenprepared. As ofyet there are not&#13;
sufficient funds to carry out the compensation (estimated at around US$2 million for 100% culling); it is&#13;
fearedthat ifthe PA fails to compensatefarmers, therelationshipbetweenfarmers andMOA coulddeteriorate,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
possibly leading to unsafe practices by farmers such as informal culling and disposal o f birds should another&#13;
outbreak hit the area.&#13;
&#13;
63.     It should be noted that the MOA Plan has several shortfalls: it does not clearly address a strategic&#13;
outlook for options and costs of restoring public confidence, for vaccination to protect from the threat o f new&#13;
Avian Influenza infections, or for the safe restocking of poultry population.&#13;
&#13;
4.3 International Supportto the Avian InfluenzaEmergency&#13;
&#13;
67.      Several international organizations have mobilized assessments of the situation and identified areas in&#13;
need of support. A Rapid Expert Mission was carried out by WHO from March 30 - April 6, 2006, and&#13;
addressedmainly human health issues. On the animal health side, the FA0 conducted a mission from April 17&#13;
-29,2006,tomakearapidassessmentforcombatingAvianInfluenza.TheWorldBankcarriedoutitsRapid&#13;
Assessment Mission from March 28 - April 15, 2006, during which the mission conducted intensive&#13;
consultations with several UN agencies (including WHO, FAO, UNRWA and UNDP) in order to consolidate&#13;
efforts to produce the UN Interagency Framework for Avian Influenza and Pandemic Response" currently&#13;
being coordinated by UNDP. However, despite all these collective efforts, only modest funds have been&#13;
mobilized, due inpart to donor hesitancy about aid levels and distribution mechanisms in the context of recent&#13;
political developments:&#13;
&#13;
68.      Some donor commitments have materialized recently. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) financed&#13;
the purchase of two PCR machines for the MOA veterinary labs; a contribution from the Russian Government&#13;
financed a total of US$1.7 million in cash payments to all the farmers who lost their poultry stock through the&#13;
mandatory culling that was implemented. In addition, duringthe first week of June 2006, the PA was able to&#13;
make some additional compensation. F A 0 and WHO have also been usingtheir own funds to assist the PA in&#13;
carrying out capacity building activities, training for staff, and provision o f specialized technical advice. FA0&#13;
has also provided some urgently needed supplies for surveillance activities, such as PPE. The UNInteragency&#13;
Framework for Avian and Pandemic Response contains a preliminary budget o f around US$30 million to&#13;
cover containment and compensation, public health, nutrition and food security needs, institutional and&#13;
technical capacity strengthening, and agricultural recovery. The Bank's intervention within the Framework&#13;
will consist o f US$10 million from the TFGWB and an additional US$3 million under the Avian and Human&#13;
InfluenzaFacility Trust Fund, to be implementeddirectly through the UNsystemfor immediate needs.&#13;
&#13;
4.4 LessonsLearned&#13;
&#13;
69.      This is the first GPAI project within the framework of a fragile or conflict-affected country. Lessons&#13;
from other AI projects should therefore be adapted to the circumstances of WBG, where experience in&#13;
implementingprevious emergency projects also provides valuable guidance, notably:&#13;
-   Any project of this type must be kept simple in terms of objectives, number and complexity of&#13;
    components, and implementation arrangements - particularly with respect to simplified financial and&#13;
    procurement arrangements. Simplified implementation arrangements are a key to achieving the overall&#13;
    objective within the limitations and timeframe imposed by an emergency context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l2Collectiveeffort ofUNagencies(WHO, FAO, UNICEF, WFP, UNDPandUNRWA) to develop an integrated&#13;
conceptualframeworkthat identifiesthe roles/ways of coordinationto meet the objectives through ajoint program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-   Proper coordination with international organizations and national and non-government institutions inorder&#13;
   to ensure a comprehensive, collective approach and to minimize both duplication o f efforts and gaps in&#13;
    coverage i s of critical importance.&#13;
-   For the purpose of quick implementatioddisbursement, project implementation through a national&#13;
    counterpart that has already acquired adequate capacity and knowledge in implementing Bank-financed&#13;
    projects is the most efficient approach. Such an arrangement might be done through a retained national&#13;
    counterpart or by an existing Project ImplementationUnit (PIU).&#13;
-   Given the need for an immediate response and in recognition of the limited capacity o f the PA to respond&#13;
    immediately and effectively to the Avian Influenza threat, drawing on international technical assistance&#13;
    and implementation of activities -particularly those related to critical surveillance and startup activities -&#13;
    is an appropriate approach. I n the context of West BanWGaza (weakened PA institutions and an area prone&#13;
    to conflict) the Rapid Assessment team concluded that immediate implementation o f critical activities&#13;
    through the UNsystem with Government approval may be the only effective solutioni3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
FINANCIALMANAGEMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
73.      The PIU will be responsible for coordination on behalf of MOH and MOA and for financial&#13;
management under the Project. It will be responsible for ensuring that the Project establishes and&#13;
maintains: (i)adequate accounting systems and procedures; (ii)flow-of-funds mechanisms facilitating&#13;
timely disbursement of funds and timely payments for goods, works and services; (iii)regular reporting&#13;
on the use of funds; and (iv) appropriate arrangementsfor regularfinancialaudits. These responsibilities&#13;
will be described in detail in a manual of financial procedures and summarized in the Financing&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
74.      Staffing. The existingFMS staffing inthe PIU consistingof a Coordinator,a financial officer, a&#13;
procurement specialist and a disbursement officer would be adequate to meet the implementation&#13;
requirements of the project at the initial phase (first six months), but additional staff will be needed to&#13;
strengthen the existing capacity and to allow for periodic visits to the producers and to review the&#13;
implementationof the Compensation Fund. The additionalstaff will report to the financial officer and&#13;
together with the disbursement officer, they will be responsible for disbursement functions as well as&#13;
project accounting -- maintaining books of accounts, reporting day-to-day transactions and preparing&#13;
accounting reports and financialstatements, as well as monitoringfinancial flows to projectbeneficiaries.&#13;
The financial officer will have primary responsibilityfor the quarterly financial reports (FMRs) and will&#13;
preparethe annualfinancialstatements for audit.&#13;
&#13;
75.      Financial Reporting. For project monitoringpurposes, quarterly financial monitoring reports&#13;
will be required. The PIU will be responsible for designing appropriate financial monitoring reports&#13;
(FMRs) to include: (a) Project Sources and Uses of Funds, (b) Uses of Funds by Project Activity, (c)&#13;
Special AccountLocal Bank Account Statements, (d) Physical progress report - - output, and (e)&#13;
Procurement monitoringreport-narratives and tables. These financial reports will be submitted to IDA&#13;
within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The first quarterlyFMR will be submitted after the end of the&#13;
first full quarter following the initial disbursement. Formats of the annual financial statements and the&#13;
FMRswill be incorporatedinthe Project OperatinalManual(POM).&#13;
&#13;
76.      DisbursementArrangements. The Recipientwill establish a Special Account in a commercial&#13;
bank, acceptableto IDA. Disbursementsof the IDA Grant proceedswill be made basedon disbursement&#13;
methods such as reimbursements, advance, direct payments and Special Commitments. Supporting&#13;
documentation will include Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) and/or records (copies of records of&#13;
payment, e.g., invoices, receipts). For certain payments, above the Minimum Application Size as&#13;
specified in the Disbursement Letter, the PIU will submit withdrawal applications to the Bank for&#13;
paymentsto suppliers andconsultants directlyfromthe Grant / CreditAccount.&#13;
&#13;
77.      Quick Disbursable Funds. The Recipient would obtain quick disbursing funds since we are&#13;
already in an emergency situation.These funds would be disbursedfrom the Avian InfluenzaTrust Fund&#13;
(AITF) and managed by the UNDP toward the financing of critical activities which have already been&#13;
identifiedinan AITF technical annex preparedby the UNagencies and submittedto the IDA.The UNDP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will be the coordinatorand establish a PIU to that end. To preserve the integrity of the project however,&#13;
UNDPwill liaise with the projectPIUfor overall implementationandfiduciary aspects.&#13;
&#13;
78.     Internal Controls. It is expectedthat both the PIU and the Compensation Fund sub-component&#13;
would maintain adequate internal control systems. Although the Compensation fund does not have&#13;
previous experience in managing resources of this size, appropriate measures have been considered to&#13;
providing the needed mechanisms for an efficient management of the fund. The PIU on the other hand,&#13;
could be strengthened so that it maintain an effective internal control system to ensure that project&#13;
expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents are maintained; accounts are reconciled&#13;
periodically; project assets, includingcash, are safeguarded, and cash compensation grants are properly&#13;
accounted for. Irrespectiveof the accounting basis followed, detailed assethnventories register will be&#13;
maintained as part of the project internal control procedures. The PIU will implement appropriate&#13;
controls over inventories of drugs, vaccines, medical equipment, and other sensitive and/or expensive&#13;
assets will beespeciallyimportantfor the project.&#13;
&#13;
79.     Compensation Fund. The Government has established a national Compensation Fund from&#13;
which the producers of birdsculledwill be compensated. The requiredimplementationarrangements still&#13;
need to be developed and put in place, and the Project will provide support to that end. The necessary&#13;
legal, institutionaland operational details will be developed and agreed upon startingfrom appraisal and&#13;
continue duringthe first monthsof project implementationandwill be includedinthe OperationalPlan.&#13;
&#13;
80.     As a condition of disbursement of funds under the Compensation Fundsub-component, the PIU&#13;
will implementappropriate internalcontrol procedures and flow-of-fundsarrangements acceptableto the&#13;
Bank and documented inthe operational/financialmanual. The Projectwill provide US$ 5.6 million to&#13;
finance and operate this Fund. US$ 0.8 million will be disbursed through the AITF so as to launchthe&#13;
compensationprocessandkeepthe producersinvolved.The remaining$4.8 million will be disbursed into&#13;
a speciallyestablishedaccount, so as to providesufficient resources for immediateandfuture needs.&#13;
&#13;
81.     Internal Control Arrangements for the Compensation Fund. The procedures for recording&#13;
poultry culledunder government orders and for establishingand recordingpoultry producer's claims for&#13;
compensation payments will be established and agreed upon. A number of minimum internal control&#13;
procedures and risk mitigation measures will be implemented with respect to recording and verifying&#13;
poultryculling andclaims for compensationpayment beforeany flow of funds is initiated.&#13;
&#13;
    0    The financial and operational manuals will detail the mechanisms for identifyingthose eligible&#13;
         for compensation payments, ensuringthat there will be no multiple claims. It is expectedthat a&#13;
         CompensationFunddatabasewill be maintainedby the Project to facilitate recordkeeping, claim&#13;
         verification, paymentfacilitation, monitoringandauditing.&#13;
    0    The culling and the preparation and processing of culling records and compensation claims will&#13;
         be done inaccordancewith the agreeduponproceduresofthe compensationfund.&#13;
    0    All forms to be usedto recordpoultry culling and compensation claims will be providedby the&#13;
         Project. They will be pre-numberedandrecordedinthe databaseofthe CompensationFund. All&#13;
         unused forms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed forms, must be returnedto the&#13;
         CompensationFundwhenthe cullingrecordsare submitted.&#13;
    0    Compensationpaymentto poultryproducerswill be either by checks or by banktransfers. There&#13;
         will beno vouchers. Paymentwill bemadewithin a few weeks fromthe date of culling.&#13;
&#13;
82.      The backyard poultry producers will, at the time of culling, receive a pre-numbered Culling&#13;
Certificate in multiple copies noting the date and the type and number of birds culled. Each certificate&#13;
will be signed by Community Culling Technical Committee (CCTC) and countersigned by the poultry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
producer. Certificates not signed by all members of the CCTC and the poultry producer would be&#13;
considered invalid. Payment will be made in personand by checks inthe beneficiaryname at the village&#13;
level.To receive payment, each poultryproducerwill berequiredto presenthidher culling certificate; the&#13;
date and amount of payment will be recorded on the certificate and countersigned by the poultry&#13;
producer.&#13;
&#13;
83.     For medium- and large-scalepoultryproducers with morethan 3,000 birds (medium = 3,000 -&#13;
10,000 and large &gt;10,000), the producer or manager will, at the time of culling, receive an Enterprise&#13;
Poultry Culling Record, signed by the Veterinary services representative. The producedmanager&#13;
countersigns. This document is the official record that establishes the poultry producers' right to&#13;
compensation. Actual compensation payments will be based on the approved number of birds culled as&#13;
confirmed by the compensation committed. The compensation payments will be made by transfers&#13;
through the banking system. The Compensation Fund will transfer the funds to the commercial banks.&#13;
The latter will instruct its branchesinthe appropriate locations to credit the account(s) ofthe producers.&#13;
&#13;

making compensation payments are designed to minimize the risk of errors or fraud and ensure funds&#13;
reach the intended beneficiaries in a transparent manner. Once authorized by the PIU, compensation&#13;
payments will be effected by the CompensationFundin one of two ways: (i)in person and by checks in&#13;
the beneficiaryname in the village or (ii) transfers throughthe local bankingsystem or any other reliable&#13;
structure operatingin WB&amp;G..&#13;
&#13;

carriedout, additionalchecksto ensurethat the eligiblepoultryproducers, and only they, are paidand are&#13;
paid in full. This will include,but notbe limitedto, periodicoperational reviews, under TORSacceptable&#13;
to IDA, to confirm the validity and legitimacyof the compensation payments made. The reviewers will&#13;
be requiredto verify compensation claims and payments made inrandomly selected samples of villages;&#13;
this verification will include: checking against the database maintained by the Compensation Fund,&#13;
collectingand verifying informationavailableand obtained at the village level, checkingwith individual&#13;
poultry producers, checking forms and reports, etc.       Any significant weaknesses identified will be&#13;
promptlyrectifiedin close consultationwith IDA. In addition, the externalindependent auditors will be&#13;
asked to provide an opinion on the reasonableness of the accounting, reporting and internal controls in&#13;
respect of the operations ofthe CompensationFund, andthe audit TORS(acceptableto IDA) will include&#13;
these specific requirements. All ineligibleclaims will be refundedto the CompensationFundandto IDA.&#13;

                                                     38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87.     Accounting System, Accounting Policy and Procedures.                 The PIU existing financial&#13;
management system will be upgraded to satisfy the reporting needs of the new projects. It will be&#13;
comprehensivewith accounting system comprisingan adequate chart of accounts which is in compliance&#13;
with the existing laws and regulations in WB&amp;G. The internal control with contain the necessary&#13;
safeguard measures for segregation of duties and adequate authorizationand approval mechanisms for&#13;
preventionof errors and irregularities.&#13;
&#13;
88.      Books of Registry. In addition to any information system installed, and the books needed to&#13;
maintainan accurate and complete recordoftransactions, the PIU will maintaina set of additionalbooks&#13;
ofregistry, either within their systemsor outsidethem for controlpurposes. These books will includeand&#13;
not be limitedto (i)Fixedassets register; (ii)recordsofcompensationpayments, etc.&#13;
&#13;
89.      Budgeting. The project annual budget process will follow WB&amp;G budget cycle which operates&#13;
on an annual basis. The project budget and work plan will be prepared by the PIU on the basis of&#13;
informationprovidedby the main ImplementingAgencies and all other implementingentities. The final&#13;
consolidated budget will be reviewed and approved by the National Emergency Committee for Avian&#13;
InfluenzaControl, before submission to the IDA by November, latest, for the following implementation&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
90.      Project FinancialStatements. In additionto the quarterly financial reports relatedto the project&#13;
activities, the PIU will produce its customary Annual Financial statements and consolidated FMRs.&#13;
These projectannual financialstatements will be composedof: (a) consolidatedStatement of Sources and&#13;
Applications o f fund; (b) consolidated use of funds by project categoriedactivities;(c) SOE withdrawal&#13;
schedules, listing individual withdrawal applications relating to disbursement through the SOE, by&#13;
reference number, date andamount; (iv) notes on significantaccounting policiesand accounting standards&#13;
adoptedfor the preparationof the accounts; and any supplementary informationor explanationthat may&#13;
be deemedappropriate by Managementto enhanceunderstandingofthe financialsituationofthe project.&#13;
&#13;
91.      Country Risks. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) dated June 2004&#13;
concludes that the overall Public Finance Management (PFM) risk in WB&amp;G is adequate insofar as the&#13;
Bank's criteria and standards for approval of a general budget support operation (or adjustment lending)&#13;
are concerned. At the project levelhowever, the FinancialManagement risk Assessment datedNovember&#13;
2005 has concludedthat the financial management project risk at 42% was one of the highest in the&#13;
region. Project compliance with the FMRs is relatively low and the quality of those received needs&#13;
improvement.Furthermore, the PA's liquidity crisis is unprecedentedand civil servant salaries haven't&#13;
been paid since March 2006. A massive strike by the staff from MOA and MOH would bring project&#13;
implementationto a halt.&#13;
&#13;
92.      Project risk.The project risk from a financial managementperspective is considered substantial&#13;
giventhe prevailingfiscal situationofthe PA. Furthermore, the capacity constraint at the levelofthe PIU&#13;
could negatively impact the financial management at the initial stage of project implementation.&#13;
Mitigating measures would be considered under the AITF grant to build the capacity and ensure full&#13;
compliance with the IDA financialreportingrequirements.These measureshave been summarized inthe&#13;
actionplantable below.&#13;
&#13;
93.      Supervision. Financial supervision activities will include inter-alia, review of quarterly FMRs,&#13;
review o f annual audited financial statements and management letters as well as timely follow up on&#13;
issues arising there from. It will also include participationin Bank overall supervision missions of the&#13;
project, as appropriate.Statements of Expenditures will be systematically reviewed on a quarterly basis.&#13;
There will be about two financialmanagementsupervisions duringthe first year two years andthereafter,&#13;
it will be once a year. Bank supervision missions will consist of visits to the PIU as well as to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

implementing agencies to review to review financial management practices, procurement methods,&#13;
payment procedures and documentation.&#13;
&#13;
94.     Financial ManagementAction Plan. Financial management arrangements o f the PIU require a&#13;
number o f actions to ensure that arrangements are fully satisfactory for the project, with its specific FM&#13;
needs, especially with respect to the Compensation Fund. The following action plan will be discussed&#13;
with the Borrower during appraisal and at Negotiations. Satisfactory implementation of the action plan&#13;
will ensure the establishment of a financial management system that fully meets requirements of the&#13;
Project and of the Bank.&#13;

B. Assessmentof the agency's capacity to implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
110.    Procurement activities will be carried out by a self contained Project Implementation Unit (PIU)&#13;
to be set up and anchored to Ministry of Health.&#13;
&#13;
111.    The PIU will be headed by a Project Coordinator who will report directly to the National&#13;
Emergency Committee for Avian Influenza Control (NCAIC) chaired by the MOHfor policy matters and&#13;
all technical and operational details concerning overall Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
112.    The PIU will comprise, in addition to the Project Coordinator, 1 Financial Controller, 1&#13;
Accountant, 1 Procurement Consultant, 1 Procurement Officer, 1 Agricultural Expert, 1 Health Expert, 1&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, 1 Outreach Specialist          and 1 support staff. Other than the&#13;
Procurement Consultant, the M&amp;ESpecialist and the Outreach Specialist who are not ready available and&#13;
need to be hired, all other PIU staff will be civil servants. The two Experts will be designated from the&#13;
Ministries of Agriculture and Health and the three fiduciary staff will be designated from the PCU at the&#13;
GazaMOHunder ESSP 11.&#13;
&#13;
 113.    The PIU will report to the MoF for compliance with the principles and procedures of Public&#13;
Financial Management in WBG as defined by the Organic Budget Law, financial directives, and&#13;
operational decrees applicable to ministries.Inthat vein, the MOF will remain responsible for signingand&#13;
processing withdrawal applications (WAS). The PIU will be anchored to M O H and established in Gaza.&#13;
To ensure, that West Bank is fully covered, a branch office will be maintainedat the M O H inWest Bank&#13;
and appropriately staffed with at least four technical staff (procurement, FM, agriculture and health ) who&#13;
will work incoordination with the main PIU in Gaza. An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing&#13;
Agency to implement procurement actions for the project has been carried out in May 2006 by the&#13;
Procurement Specialist assignedto the project team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114.    The assessmenthas determinedthat the PIU will needto be established and strengthenedso as&#13;
to be brought in line with the implementation requirements under the Avian Project. This will be&#13;
supported by UNDP-executedAvian and Human InfluenzaFacility Trust FundGrant (UNTF Grant) for&#13;
the immediate implementationof critical activitiesbefore the mainproject is launched.Under that Grant,&#13;
the UNDPwill finalize the job descriptionof the fiduciary staff and assist the PA with their recruitment.&#13;
UNDP will also provide capacity-building as a means to gradually strengthen the main PIU prior to&#13;
project effectiveness. This will entail, inter-alia, (i)backstoppingthe PIU Procurement officer in the&#13;
preparationof the Procurement Planwith on thejob training, (ii)  assistingthe Financialstaff in settingup&#13;
the financial management system to comply with the Bank financial reporting requirements and (iii)&#13;

&#13;
115.    The overallprojectrisk for procurement is High.&#13;
&#13;
C. ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
116.    A Procurement Plan (PP) for project implementation covering the initial 12 month period of&#13;
project implementationwill be preparedby negotiations. The updated PP for each subsequent year will&#13;
be submittedto the Bank for approval before the end of the previous year and will use a pre-defined&#13;
format which will, as a minimum,list (i)  goods and services to be procuredduringthe following calendar&#13;
year, (ii)their value; (iii) the method of procurement; and (iv) the time table to carry out the&#13;
procurement.. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as&#13;
requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneedsand improvements in institutionalcapacity. An&#13;
initial PP is attachedto the presentappendix and shallbe finalizedand agreedon at Negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
D.ProcurementMethodsand Thresholds&#13;
&#13;
 117.    The Grant agreementwill define the appropriate procurementand selection methods. The annual&#13;
Procurement Plan (PP) shall set forth those contracts which shall be subject to Bank's prior review&#13;
process.All other contractsshallbe subjectto post review.&#13;

F.UNAgenciesasProcurementAgents&#13;
&#13;
 119.    In accordance with the Procurement Guidelines Section 3.9, the Project's procurement&#13;
 arrangements would include the use of Specialized Agencies of the United Nations (WHO, FA0 and&#13;
UNICEF) as suppliers of goods mainly for drugs and vaccines (total estimate of US$350,000) and some&#13;
 medical supplies such as reagents and lab equipment. Drugs to be procured under the project are&#13;
 registeredin Israelwhich will avoid difficultieswhich usually face the import and registrationof drugs&#13;
 offeredfrom abroad. In addition, it is foreseen under the Projectto use the UNDP as procurement agent&#13;
 to support the PIU procurement function. The use of UN Agencies as agents will have to meet the&#13;
 requirements of Sections 3.10 and 3.15 of the Procurement Guidelines. The procurement agents will&#13;
 follow the Bank's Procurement Guidelines under the standard agreement between the Bank and the&#13;
 respective agency.&#13;

G. ProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
120.    Given the high procurementrisk of the project and in addition to the prior review supervisionto&#13;
be carried out from Bank offices, two (2) supervision missions per year are recommendedto visit the&#13;
fieldto carry out ex- postreview of procurementactions.&#13;
&#13;
H. ProcurementAudits&#13;
&#13;
121.    Becausethe Projecthas high level of flexibility built inthe procurementarrangementsandto help&#13;
the Bank carry out post-reviews of procurement actions, independent consultants, as part of the project&#13;
and at the cost of the project, under TOR acceptableto the Bank, will be hired to review and audit the&#13;
procurement process during the implementation. The scope of work of the consultant to carry out the&#13;
procurement audit, does not replace the Bank obligation to carry out its ex-post review at least once a&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
I.Fraud,CoercionandCorruption&#13;
&#13;
122.    All procuring entities as well as bidders, suppliersand contractorsshall observe the highest&#13;
standardof ethics during the procurementand executionof contracts financed underthe Project in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
123.     The project has been classified as category B Project since it involves moderate environmental&#13;
impacts that can be managed duringthe implementation o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
124.     Prevention-focused activities are expected to have positive environmental impacts as project&#13;
investments infacilities, equipment, laboratories, and training will improvethe effectiveness and safety of&#13;
existing AI handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards established by the OIE.&#13;
This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into the protocols and&#13;
procedures for culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks, decontamination of production&#13;
facilities, and laboratory biosafety. However, adverse environmental health impacts, mainly inadvertent&#13;
spread o f HPAI, could occur when an emergency operation involves containment of HPAI outbreaks&#13;
through quarantine, isolation and stamping out actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not in&#13;
~1ace.l~&#13;
&#13;
125.     The primary potential riskscan be grouped into three categories:&#13;
&#13;
         (a)      Inadvertenthuman exposure and spread o fthe virus due to: improper culling and disposal&#13;
                  of dead birds (wild birds,16sick and dead birds from backyardand commercial poultries);&#13;
                  lack of, or improper use of personal protection equipment (PPE); improper disposal of&#13;
                  farm waste (i.e., bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an outbreak);             l7and&#13;
                  inadequate lab biosafety protocols.&#13;
&#13;
         (b)      Inadvertent release o f chemicals inthe environment from unsatisfactory decontamination&#13;
                  procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
         (c)      Release of chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from inadequate&#13;
                  laboratory and medical facility waste management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
126.     The project triggersOP 4.01 on Environment Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management. The&#13;
safeguard issues which pertain to the Project are (i)        selection and implementation o f culling methods; (ii)&#13;
selection and implementation of disposal methods for culled poultry and associated waste; (ii)safe&#13;
disposal o f medical waste; and (iv) mitigating the negative economic impacts o f disease-inducted death&#13;
and/or mandated culling o f poultry on small-scale and backyard poultry producers.&#13;
&#13;
127.     OP 4.09 on Pest Management: The procurement of any pesticide will be contingent on an&#13;
assessment o f the nature and degree of associated risks, taking into account the proposed use and the&#13;
intended users. The Project will require that any pesticides it finances be manufactured, packaged,&#13;
labeled, handled, stored, disposed of, and applied according to standards acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;

Bank does not finance formulated products that fall in WHO classes IA and IB, or formulations of&#13;
products inClass 11, if(a) the country lacks restrictions on their distribution and use; or (b) they are likely&#13;
to be used by, or be accessible to, lay personnel, farmers, or others without training, equipment, and&#13;
facilities to handle, store, and apply these productsproperly.&#13;
&#13;
128.     The project will not finance activities which would trigger OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.&#13;
e.g., selected disposal sites, landfills and burial pits, will be on public land rather than private sites to&#13;
avoid land expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
129.     The project will be processed under OP8.50 and the first activity of this project will be the&#13;
development of an EMP, which will be disclosed in the country and in the Infoshop. The proposed&#13;
investmentsin laboratory facilities, equipment and stafftraining will improve the effectiveness and safety&#13;
of Avian Influenza and testing proceduresby meeting international standards by the World Organization&#13;
for Animal Health (OIE). Whatever medicalwaste is generated inhealth care facilities and waste from the&#13;
animal health component will be managed using existing guidelines inthe countries. The country project&#13;
will also support updating these guidelines, training of health care workers to manage medicinal waste&#13;
following these guidelines and the purchase of equipmentfor the proper handling and disposal of medical&#13;
waste in selected facilities. This provision would be included in the project operational manual (or&#13;
equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
130.     Overall, the Project would assist the government entities to develop a strategy for managing&#13;
future emergingand re-emergingdiseases outbreaks.As suchthe project will improve environmental and&#13;
social safeguards in following areas: (a) mainstreaming environmental safeguards into protocols and&#13;
proceduresfor the culling and disposalof animals and waste during an outbreak, inparticular by adopting&#13;
OIE standards and aligned with WHO procedures and recommendations, and improving bio-medical-&#13;
waste management systems in health facilities and laboratories; (b) financing safe culling and disposal&#13;
options; and (c) development of policies on compensation for poultry farmers affected by future&#13;
outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
131.     Since the project supports investments for the culling and disposal of carcasses and laboratory&#13;
wastes, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared. The EMP will be developed&#13;
following the "Interim Guidelines for Managing Potential Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in&#13;
Bank-AssistedAvian Influenza Control Projects", Quality Assurance and Compliance Unit, April 2006.&#13;
The EMP will cover the selection of appropriate culling methods, clean-up of animal wastes of infected&#13;
and culled poultry and selection and management of disposal facilities. The scope of this EMP will be&#13;
specified during the initial period of Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
132.     Under the project an EnvironmentalSpecialist will be hired to oversee the implementation&#13;
of the Environmental activities. The disclosure of the EMP in the country and InfoShop will be a&#13;
condition for disbursement for the implementationof culling and disposal activities. On the conditions of&#13;
disbursement on the compensation component: any conditions will apply for future culling, not past&#13;
culling, with the conditionality applying only to the completion and operation ofthe EMP.&#13;

                       Appendix 9: AdditionalBackgroundon Compensation            '*&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Determiningthe Reasonsfor Compensation&#13;
&#13;
133.    The reason for compensation affects decisions about who shouldbe compensated(see 2) and how&#13;
the process should work (see 3-5). Compensation can therefore be considered for different reasons, which&#13;
are:&#13;
&#13;
    Compensation increasethe incentives to report suspected cases of AI influenza inpoultry&#13;
0   Itis arguably a government responsibilityto compensatewhen private assets of citizens are destroyed&#13;
    for public purposes;&#13;
    Livelihood support: Provide a "safety net" to protect the different groups of farmers against the&#13;
    economic losses incurred by having to wait for restocking and/or when they cannot sell their birds&#13;
    anymore due to the enforcement of movement restrictions. This may take the form o f insurance or&#13;
    some kindo f social security. Strictly speaking this is not compensation, although it is often discussed&#13;
    at the same time that compensation i s being planned, and in countries with a well-funded livestock&#13;
    sector, both compensation and livelihoods support mechanisms may be inplace.&#13;
&#13;
134.    These reasonsjustify a typical compensation process where any farmers whose birds are culled&#13;
by "culling teams" (as decided by authorities) are compensatedfor the birds destroyed. Ifthe government&#13;
provides complete compensation whenever things go wrong, individuals are not encouraged to take steps&#13;
to reduce risk. Therefore, compensation would not normally be 100% of lost revenues. Instead risks are&#13;
shared between farmers and the government, and part of the risk may be borne by some kindo f insurance&#13;
scheme to which farmers contribute (see later).&#13;
&#13;
DecidingWho Will be Compensated&#13;
&#13;
135.    The questions that need to be considered are: (i)which actors or stakeholders? (ii)should&#13;
compensation be limited to farmers or also include processors and marketers? (iii)Should all sizes of&#13;
farms/poultry production sectors be included? (iv) how will social biases (e.g., anti-poor, gender, ethnic&#13;
group, etc.) be avoided?&#13;
&#13;
136.    The aim o ftargetingwho is goingto be compensatedis basedon:&#13;
&#13;
    Encouraging early disease reporting;&#13;
0   Encouraging people to take part in official compensation schemes, everyone whose birds are culled&#13;
    needs to be included.&#13;
&#13;
137.    Ifcare is nottaken inplanning, certain key stakeholders (often the most vulnerable or those with&#13;
least "voice") can be excluded from compensation programs. This can reduce the effectiveness o f control&#13;
programs and the bio-security status in affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
138.    Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, ifthere is no compensation for dead animals there is&#13;
the risk of animal movement (Le. disease spread). However death might not be due to HPAI but to&#13;
similar diseases (e.g. NewcastleDisease).&#13;
'*This approachto compensationprovidedby FA0 consultant following April 2006 missionto WBG.&#13;
                                                     59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Agreeingon the Levelof Compensation&#13;
&#13;
139.     Special attention has been given up to now on the mechanism on how to determine the&#13;
compensation level. This is indeeda delicate but crucial area that needs to be seriously debated between&#13;
stakeholders in the poultry sector. Points that the government needs to take into account when deciding&#13;
the price for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
    It is generally better to have uniformpricesat nationallevelto avoid people/farmers moving birds.&#13;
    This is to avoid movementwf birds due to price differences, as this would increase disease spread&#13;
    nationally;&#13;
    Different prices by species and category (age, broiler or layer) should be negotiated but it is advised&#13;
    notto include too many categories. Keepthe list short to make it administratively implementable;&#13;
    Decide in advance what compensationprice will be based on productioncosts in the case o f West&#13;
    Bank and Gaza Strip given that market prices are distorted;&#13;
    State a date when the compensationwill be receivedby the farmer (and stick to it);&#13;
    It may also be necessary also to include production losses from "downtime" or birds that die from&#13;
    HPAI. For farmer compliance with the emergency contingency scheme. If farmers are adequately&#13;
    compensated they are more likely to comply with culling schemes. Losses from downtime can be&#13;
    considerable. However, while estimating losses is quite simple for commercial flocks, it i s more&#13;
    difficult for backyardflocks. WHY?&#13;
&#13;
DecidingWhether the Costs of ControlMeasureswill beRefunded&#13;
&#13;
140.     Funds should be readily available through pro-rata estimates (e.g. amount per farm/household&#13;
culled) for direct disease control measures associated to the culling activities such as disinfection,&#13;
protection for cullingteams etc.&#13;
&#13;
141.     A contingency or compensation plan will be less effective if it does not take into account the&#13;
direct costs o f culling and control measuresthat may be borne by farmers. Compensation programs might&#13;
provide good opportunities for building capacity in biosecurity. Funds may be provided to allow&#13;
upgradingo f biosecurity (e.g. birdproofing farms etc).&#13;
&#13;
Administeringand EnforcingCompensation&#13;
&#13;
 142.    Governments needto decide inadvance on the way people have to register for compensation. The&#13;
date o f compensation needs to be clearly stated to farmers for compliance. The numbers o f animals&#13;
reported need to be checked for accuracy taking into account that each production system presents a&#13;
different kind o f challenge. Accuracy checking is also important to avoid "double compensation" or&#13;
people missingout.&#13;
&#13;
 143.    However an accurate and accountable registration scheme may be difficult to implement (see&#13;
chart below). State culling teams could register the number o f birds culled, but they need to work fast,&#13;
otherwise infected birdsmight die or people cull their own birds before they can be registered.&#13;
&#13;
 144.    The system to make payments needs to be simple and make use o f existing institutions(e.g.&#13;
veterinary services, financial institutions, NGOs etc).     Farmers might not have a bank account for&#13;
receiving a payment. The efficiency o f these institutions, though, needs to be evaluated before engaging&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FundingStrata&#13;
&#13;
145.    The setting up, source o f funding and management o f the fund need to be planned in close&#13;
collaboration with the Ministry o f Finance and may require changes of legislation. Areas that needto be&#13;
discussed inadvance are:&#13;
&#13;
    Estimate how much is neededto set upthe fund (from previous information, i.e. number of animals,&#13;
    categories and compensation levels);&#13;
    Sources o f funding may be from national and/or local levels. Dependingon the structure of public&#13;
    finances of the country i.e. devolution levels;&#13;
    Ideally, funding i s from both public and private sources. With a well organized private sector, it i s&#13;
    possible to set up a fund for livestock emergencies, to which the government and the private sector&#13;
    can contribute. This sharing is to encourage reporting, help to ensure against losses, share the&#13;
    financial risk between the public and private sector so that both will take steps to reduce the disease&#13;
    risk;&#13;
    Commercial farmers may take out private insurance if a scheme i s available. Insuredfarmers will&#13;
    probably be askedtojoin a quality management scheme;&#13;
    Incase of internationalcontribution, there is a needto agree on how the funds will be disbursedand&#13;
    the monitoring process.HPAI being a Global Public Good (GPG) there is a rationale for international&#13;
    contribution;&#13;
    Decide who is going to manage the fund and where it i s going to be located (i.e. ministry of finance&#13;
    (MoF) / ministry of agriculture (MOA)).Decide on fast mechanisms to disburse those funds to the&#13;
    local level. MOAtends to have the technical expertise but generally MoF does not allow other&#13;
    ministriesto managefunds for what is labeled as "accountability reasons" (see chart below).&#13;
&#13;
146.    Finally, it is important to take a clear decision on what is the authorities' strategy whenhf the&#13;
disease becomes endemic with regard to the compensation scheme above elaborated. When dealing with&#13;
endemic HPAI and the possibility of poultry vaccination, attention should be drawn to the interventions&#13;
needed to modify biosecurity conditions associated to the existing poultry production system in the&#13;
country (Le. backyard raisingand smallholder producers).&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Avian Influenza
            Prevention and Control Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Avian Influenza Prevention and
            Control Project for West Bank and Gaza aims to achieve a
            minimum level of spread of Avian Influenza to humans through
            better preparedness, control, and response; and achieve a
            minimum level of income loss of targeted farmers through
            compensation.  This would be measured by: Sustained
            prevention rate among high-risk groups; reduced infection
            rate of HPAI in poultry; and a targeted percentage of
            farmer's income loss compensated. Monitoring
            implementation (M&amp;E) progress in an emergency project of
            this nature will require continuous and systematic reviews
            of the various activities. M&amp;E activities are intended
            to: (a) measure input, output, and outcome indicators; (b)
            provide regular and up-to-date information on the progress
            towards meeting the interim activities' benchmarks and
            the overall Project objective; (c) alert the implementing
            partners to implementation problems and provide a basis on
            which performance could be improved; and (d) determine
            whether the relevant stakeholders are responding as expected.
