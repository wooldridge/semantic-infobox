            Project design for payment systems
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Weaknesses in a payment system can
            result in inefficient use of the available money stock,
            inequitable risk sharing between trading parties, lack of
            confidence in the banking system, and inadequate support for
            the development of other essential financial services.
            Moreover, because of the opportunity cost of money, lags
            between the sale of goods and services and the receipt of
            funds are costly.  To meet market demand, this Note
            recommends four payment services: local clearinghouse
            arrangements to process local interbank debit and credit
            payments, a capability to process nonlocal inter- and
            intrabank debit and credit payments, a separate capability
            to process high-value and other time-sensitive credit
            payments, and a capability to process international payments
            in a variety of currencies.  The common factors that
            influence the success of the payment systems are: speed of
            payment, certainty and finality of payment, system
            reliability, safety and security, convenience, and cost.
            The challenge is to strike the right balance across these
            factors, depending on user needs.  This Note also includes a
            framework for modernizing the payment system.  Any
            initiative for such project must involve users--at the
            policy level and at the working level.
