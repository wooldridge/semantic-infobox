&#13;
The Environment and Natural Resources Division of EDI (EDIEN) conducted a core course on&#13;
Environmental Economics for Development Policy in Washington, D.C., from July 6-17,&#13;
1998. The two-week course was designed to introduce participants to the latest&#13;
developments and best practices in using environmental economics to address natural&#13;
resources and environmental problems. Environmental issues were examined at the macro,&#13;
sectoral, and project levels to enable participants to derive relevant policy recommendations.&#13;
Participants were expected to strengthen their analytical skills on new policies and programs&#13;
for sustainable development, and train various audiences on specific environmental issues of&#13;
relevance to their countries. The course consisted of a total of 39 thematic sessions,&#13;
including case studies, and a Saturday computer workshop. Forty-nine participants from 28&#13;
countries attended this course, consisting primarily of environmental economists and&#13;
researchers from governments, universities, and multilateral institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using both formative and&#13;
summative evaluation methods. The formative method used two in-course, open-ended group&#13;
interviews that were conducted in the middle of each week. Participants' views of course&#13;
structure and content, case studies, opportunity to ask questions, and learning methodology&#13;
were obtained for the course presenters and staff to make adjustments to improve the&#13;
course.&#13;
&#13;
Summative methods included two types of questionnaires. First, different course instructors'&#13;
skills were evaluated based on 24 end-of-session questionnaires (EOS). The average&#13;
response rate of EOS was 72 percent, ranging from a total of 15 respondents (Session 37) to&#13;
49 respondents (Sessions 22 and 23) out of 49 participants. Session 38 was the participants'&#13;
case study presentations and was excluded from the evaluation. Secondly, an end-of-course&#13;
(EOC) questionnaire was used to obtain respondents' feedback on overall course&#13;
performance. The EOC questionnaire was completed by 42 respondents (response rate =&#13;
85.7%). For the EOC respondents, 10 held either Doctorates or an equivalent, 28 held&#13;
Masters degrees or an equivalent, and 4 held Bachelors degrees or an equivalent. Twenty-&#13;
seven respondents held degrees in Economics. Of the 42 respondents, 15 (35.7%) were&#13;
women. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was&#13;
used for all questions in both EOS and EOC questionnaires.&#13;
&#13;
The course also used pre/post cognitive surveys to estimate the respondents' knowledge&#13;
levels before and after the course. Two different sets of 13 multiple-choice questions were&#13;
randomly assigned to pre/post course surveys. Forty-six respondents completed the pre-&#13;
course survey (response rate = 93.9 percent) and 42 completed the post-course survey&#13;
(response rate = 85.7 percent). Following is a summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents gave the indicator measuring the overall usefulness of the course one of&#13;
        the highest course performance ratings, 4.10 out of 5.0. Eighty-one percent of the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 respondents rated 4 or 5 on this indicator. Two items that were found particularly&#13;
 useful were the presentations (mean=3.81) and training materials (mean=3.95).&#13;
 Respondents also felt that the course provided new information (mean=4.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lA relatively lower rating was reported on the extent to which the respondents felt&#13;
 equipped at the end of the course to apply the approaches and analytical tools taught&#13;
 in the course. The mean score was 3.14 out of 5.0. Thirty-three percent of the&#13;
 respondents felt equipped well by rating 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post cognitive surveys indicated that the average number of correct responses&#13;
 given by the respondents was 5.91 out of 13 questions before the course (45.5&#13;
 percent correct) and 7.31 out of 13 questions upon completion of the course (56.2&#13;
 percent correct). This was a percentage increase of over 10 percent in the&#13;
 respondents knowledge. A T-test was conducted to see if the difference in the two&#13;
 mean scores was statistically significant. The result indicated that the respondents in&#13;
 fact scored significantly higher after the course (t=3.38, p&lt; .001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lResults from the respondents' self-assessment of their ability or knowledge before and&#13;
 after the course indicated positive increases in their understanding of all key issues.&#13;
 Pre-course mean scores fell between the mid- to high 2.0 on all items except four&#13;
 issues. Post-course ratings ranged between 3.59 and 4.18. The percentage gains&#13;
 varied from 27.3 percent (on the problems faced by governments in making society&#13;
 aware of the link between environment and economic development) to 57.1 percent&#13;
 (on the application of environmental valuation methods).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lSix indicators measuring the course instructors' communication and presentation&#13;
 skills exceeded 3.0 out of 5.0 for all instructors. Respondents' views, however, varied&#13;
 among 24 different groups of instructors. Seven groups of instructors received a below-&#13;
 4.0 average rating on all 6 indicators. Results showed that respondents' ratings on&#13;
 teaching methods of these instructors, either the use of relevant approaches and/or&#13;
 analytical tools, appropriate training materials, or illustrative examples and case&#13;
 studies, tended to be lower than other indicators of instructors skills. Nine groups of&#13;
 instructors whose mean scores exceeded 4.0 on all 6 items received particularly high&#13;
 scores on their ability to answer questions adequately and/or communicate their&#13;
 messages clearly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe course designers made changes throughout the course based on issues raised&#13;
 by the participants during the two mid-week in-course interviews. Two notable&#13;
 improvements made to the course were the allocation of certain time at the end of&#13;
 each session for questions and answers and the provision of personal assistance from&#13;
 instructors and staff for participants' better understanding of the logic of the course&#13;
 content and sequencing of a very large volume of information provided by the course.&#13;
 Participants also raised during the interviews that there was a need for more active&#13;
 exchange of views among participants. On the EOC questionnaire, 59% of&#13;
 respondents felt at the end of the course that there was still too little interaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were limitations to the evaluation. First, the statistical test of the pre/post&#13;
 cognitive surveys was based on the comparison of two unmatched groups. The paired-&#13;
 data matching individual respondents in pre/post surveys were not available due to&#13;
 anonymity of the surveys. Second, information on respondents' educational and&#13;
 professional levels was not available for the cognitive assessment. This information&#13;
 would be useful in assessing knowledge increases by respondents' different&#13;
 characteristics.&#13;
