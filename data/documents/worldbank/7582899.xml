                          PART 1: AFTERMATH OFTHE CONFLICT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.       The endof the conflict&#13;
&#13;
1.       The prospects for lastingpeace inAngola are now strong. InApril 2002 the representatives&#13;
o f the government and of UniZo Nacional para Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) signed a&#13;
ceasefire and peace agreement. Incontrast to agreements signed in 1991 and 1994, this agreement&#13;
has held, and UNITA has transformed itself into a political party. It i s anticipated that presidential&#13;
and parliamentaryelections will be heldin2009.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The peaceagreementcreateda uniqueopportunity to re-start development after almost four.&#13;
decades of war, and to achieve a permanent reduction inpoverty inAngola. To consolidate peace&#13;
and national reconciliation, the government quickly began to implement programs aimed at&#13;
restoring order and security, at addressing the needs o f the most vulnerable groups, at revitalizing&#13;
the economy, at restarting essential social services, and at rebuilding critical infrastructure,&#13;
including roads, bridges, and railways.      To both promote development, and to restore the&#13;
confidence of development partners and investors, the government i s undertaking economic&#13;
reforms and tackling issues of governance. It i s also improving oversight over government&#13;
revenues and increasing control ofpublic expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Economicand social impactofthe conflict&#13;
&#13;
3.       Angola `s almost 30 years of post-independence civil conflict have had devastating effects&#13;
on the country's economy, infrastructure, and citizens' quality of life. It i s estimated that over 1&#13;
million people were killed in the conflict and about 4 million people were displaced (including&#13;
100,000 unaccompanied children), about one-third of the country's 16 million citizens. Most of the&#13;
displaced fled to Luanda, Lobito, and other coastal cities.      Many continue to live in squalid&#13;
conditions in overcrowded urban and semi-urban areas without functioning health, water and&#13;
sanitation infrastructure, and without adequate social services. The potential for epidemics in such&#13;
conditions i s high, as demonstrated by the 2006 cholera epidemic. It i s also likely that the number&#13;
o f people infected by HIV/AIDS i s rising rapidly due to the increased movement of people and a&#13;
lack o f HIV/AIDS awareness. The country's health situation i s becoming even more complex as&#13;
millions o f internally displaced people are returning to their provinces o f origin.           Many&#13;
communities, already severely affected by the war, are struggling to cope with the influx of&#13;
returnees.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Angola has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. Nearly one in four&#13;
Angolans is extremely poor, surviving on less than US$0.75 a day, and about 70 percent o f&#13;
Angolans live on less than US$2 a day.1 The challenge for Angola now i s to ensure that its&#13;
growing oil and other revenues are used effectively to dramatically reduce poverty and the gap&#13;
between rich and poor. Although gross national income per capita i s US$1,980 (2006), income is&#13;
highlyunequally distributed(Angola has a Gini coefficient of 0.62). The richest 20 percent of the&#13;

Report 35362-AO.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
population controls 43 percent of household expenditure, while the poorest 20 percent enjoy just&#13;
4.4 percent.'&#13;
&#13;
5.      Angola's social indicators are among the worst in the world. Life expectancy i s just 47&#13;
years. Malnutrition is acute; about 45 percent of children under age 5 suffer from stunting (low&#13;
height-for-age) and 31 percent are underweight. About one in four Angolan children die before&#13;
their fifth birthday, 90 percent of whom perish due to malaria, diarrhea or respiratory tract&#13;
infections. The maternal mortality rate (at 1,700 per 100,000 births) i s one of the highest in Sub-&#13;
SaharanAfrica. Three infive people do not have access to safe water or sanitation. Primary school&#13;
enrollment i s among the lowest inAfrica; inthe regions most affectedby the war, just 25 percent of&#13;
children are enrolled inprimary school. Only 27 percent o f students who enter grade one complete&#13;
grade four. The limitedaccess to education has left 70 percent of adult men and 80 percent o f adult&#13;
women unable to read, write, or perform basic omputations.                  On average, women have less&#13;
education, lower health status, and a heavier work load than men. Regional disparities inaccess to&#13;
basic services are also substantial. For example, inthe eastern provinces where the humanitarian&#13;
needs are perhaps the most striking, distances to the nearest hospitals can sometime be more than&#13;
100 kilometers. Angola ranks 162 out o f 177 countries on the 2006 Human Development Index.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Despite massive oil revenues, Angola has made little progress towards attaining most&#13;
MDGs (although data limitations prevent sound assessment of Angola's status with respect to the&#13;
MDGs). Progress is evident only towards the goals of universal primary education and&#13;
environmental sustainability. The proportion of people with access to safe drinking water has also&#13;
increased since the 1990s. Inaddition, the number o f children immunized against measles and the&#13;
proportion of births attended by skilled birthattendants has risen, which should translate into better&#13;
childand maternal health&#13;
&#13;
C.       Currenteconomic conditions&#13;
&#13;
7.       Angola has prepared a draft PRSP (Estratkgia de Combate a Pobreza or ECP). Although&#13;
the ECP was approved by the Council of Ministers in December 2003, it has not been formally&#13;
released pending elaboration of a realistic and forward-looking macroeconomic framework&#13;
consistent with sound public expenditure policies. The PRSP i s being revised to address these&#13;
weaknesses and to cover 2006-08. The draft ECP proposes a public expenditure program focusing&#13;
on ten priority areas: (A) social reinsertion; (b) de-mining; (c) food security and rural development;&#13;
(d) HIV/ATDS; (e) education; (f) health; (g) basic infrastructure; (h) employment and vocational&#13;
training; (i) governance; and (j) macroeconomic management.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Thegovernment isjnancing its investmentprogram from a variety of sources. Angola has&#13;
taken out large lines o f credit, mostly from non-OECD donors, to finance its reconstructionneeds.&#13;
The government has been attracted to credit lines from non-OECD donors for several reasons.&#13;
Access to Chinese and other resources has enabled the government to predict that by 2008 it will&#13;
have restored a skeleton infrastructure to the point where it should be possible to proceed with the&#13;
long-delayed legislative and presidential elections. Still, the government recognizes the benefits of&#13;
accessing funds from the traditional donors, especially the World Bank. Of great importance i s the&#13;
legitimacy that the government gains by engaging with the multilateral institutions, which enables it&#13;
to attract funds from the private sector and other sources. Also o f value i s the expertise and global&#13;
knowledge offered by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Very little reliable data exist on incidence, nature, andgeographical distribution ofpovertyinAngola. A&#13;
highpriority i s to undertake a nationwide household survey to generate baseline data on poverty to underpin&#13;
the development and implementation of a meaningful poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.       Governance&#13;
&#13;
9.       Shortfalls in the effectiveness and transparency of public resource management continue to&#13;
hinder governance. Angola i s perceived to be one of the most poorly governed countries in the&#13;
world, according to indicators compiled by the World Bank Institute. The governance plan for the&#13;
country i s laid out inthe 2005 PEMFAR. Progress in implementingthe recommendations of the&#13;
review i s considered moderate or unsatisfactory overall. Poor governance discourages private&#13;
investment and limits the ability of a country to reduce poverty and inequality. Angola's adminis-&#13;
trative capacity is very low by international standards, limiting the ability o f the state to deliver&#13;
essential public services. Power is centralized inthe presidentialadministration, roles and functions&#13;
o f ministries and other state agencies (including state-owned enterprises) are not clear, and the lines&#13;
separating the state andprivate sectors are often blurred.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Nonetheless, someprogress seems to have been made in improving governance since 2002.&#13;
According to World Bank Institute indicators Angola's political stability, government effectiveness,&#13;
andvoice and accountability did likely improve between 2002 and 2005; control of corruption,&#13;
regulatory quality, and rule of law may also have shown some improvement inthe same period.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Partnerships&#13;
&#13;
11.      The Bank is leveragingits support by working inclose partnership with other stakeholders&#13;
in Angola's future. Given the declining importance of finance from OECD partners in Angola,&#13;
imaginative approaches to partnerships are needed to ensure that Bank and others' resources are&#13;
used as effectively as possible. This will mean closer collaboration with stakeholders in Angola's&#13;
future, including other donors, the private sector, civil society organizations, and Angolan&#13;
universities and think tanks.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Development partners are focusing on building institutional capacity in their programs to&#13;
foster good governance, and to ensure that finds are managed transparently and usedeffectively for&#13;
their intended purposes. Partners' investment funds are targeting social services, demining, and&#13;
strengthening macroeconomic management and statistical systems. Some bilateral partners are&#13;
promoting development o f civil society organizations so that over the mediumterm they can more&#13;
effectively act as institutions of accountability, strengtheningthe checks and balances insociety and&#13;
on government performance. Two particular challenges face development partners: the need to&#13;
strengthen collaboration and alignment among themselves, even while leadership structures are&#13;
weak; and working out how to engage effectively with non-OECD partners. The Bank and the&#13;
UNDP are co-leaders o f donor harmonizationefforts.&#13;
&#13;
 F.      Sector issues&#13;
&#13;
13.      Agriculture. Angola has immense potential to produce a diverse range of agricultural&#13;
goods.    However, lack o f transportation infrastructure, displacement of farmers and loss o f&#13;
livestock, and the collapse o f commercial agriculture and rural marketing have prevented this&#13;
potential from beingrealized. The Bank i s the government's most important partner inrevitalizing&#13;
agricultural productivity and competitiveness. The first phase o f EMRP has helpedreestablish the&#13;
institutional capacity o f Angola's two agriculture research centers, and of rural extension services&#13;
inthe provinces ofMalanje and BiC. It is also supporting the revitalization of capacity to produce&#13;
and multiply maize and other seeds and basic vegetative material of cassava and sweet potato&#13;
adaptedto the agro-climatic conditions of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.      Health. Health conditions are dismal. Angola's population i s burdened by nutritional&#13;
deficiencies and infectious and parasitic diseases. Malaria, respiratory infections, diarrhea diseases,&#13;
measles, and cholera are the main causes of illness and death. Sleeping sickness has reemergedin&#13;
the northwest. Reliable data on HIV/AIDS in Angola are lacking. However, proxy measures&#13;
indicate that the epidemic i s well established and that it has already reached the explosive phase in&#13;
Luanda and some other areas. The government i s particularly concerned with the high infant&#13;
mortality and the risingmaternal mortality rate.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Education. Angola spends a smaller percentage of public resources on education than any&#13;
other country of Sub-Saharan Africa (only 7 percent of the total public budget compared to an&#13;
average of 17 percent in Sub-SaharanAfrica), although about 59 percent of the total population i s&#13;
below 25 years o f age. Access to education at all levels of the system i s severely constrained and&#13;
educational quality i s very poor. As a result, Angola has one of the lowest rates o f literacy in Sub-&#13;
SaharanAfrica. Only 30 percent of the populationand 20 percent of women can read and write.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Transportation infrastructure.   The war and neglect have taken their toll on the road and&#13;
rail network. It i s estimated that some 80 percent o f the road network i s invery bad condition, and&#13;
most of the rail network i s closed apart from a few short-haul services near the ports. Peace opened&#13;
the way for alarge increaseinroadtransport, and about 50 percent ofthe primary roadnetwork has&#13;
been reopened to traffic since 2002 according to government estimates. Since 1975, air transport&#13;
has provided the only reliable mode o f long-distance transport withinAngola.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Electricity services. The electricity supply system in Angola has deteriorated during the&#13;
last 30 years. The main hydroelectric plants and transmission lines o f the system were built during&#13;
the 197Os, and important parts of the system are out of service due to war damage and lack o f&#13;
investment and maintenance. In the areas that still have electricity, including Luanda, power&#13;
failures and load shedding are frequent, and firms and households that can afford to rely heavily on&#13;
small-scale diesel generators.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Water supply. Only about 38 percent o f Angolans have access to safe water (compared to&#13;
55 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa), and 44 percent have access to adequate sanitation services. In&#13;
Luanda, 70 percent of the population rely on untreated river water brought into the capital by&#13;
tanker, paying prices 50 times the price paid by those connected to the pipednetwork. Water and&#13;
sanitation systems have totally collapsed inthe areas most affected by the war, including Malanje,&#13;
Kuito, andN'Dalatando.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Sanitation. About 61 percent of the urban populationhas access to some sanitation service,&#13;
with 18 percent connected to a sewer and the remainder relying on septic tanks, latrines, and&#13;
leaching pits. The first phase o f EMRP has supported the rehabilitation of water and sanitation&#13;
systems in urban areas in BiC, Malanje, Kwanza Norte, and in some rural areas of Moxico. It i s&#13;
also addressing some problems of sanitation and erosion inLuanda and Moxico.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Urban streets and drainage. Lack of maintenance and problems with drainage and erosion&#13;
have underminedmany urban streets, leaving many pavements in the main urban centers in a state&#13;
o f virtual collapse. Lack of proper drainage also contributes to landslides, which threaten life and&#13;
damage property.&#13;
&#13;
G.       Government's rehabilitationandreconstructionprogram&#13;
&#13;
21.      The government's rehabilitation and reconstruction program comprises two overlapping&#13;
phases. The first phase, called the priority phase (Priority Phase o f the Multisector Rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and Reconstruction Program, PPMRRP), was originally expected to be implemented during 2003-&#13;
08. The government subsequently expanded the scope of the PPMRRP to cover additional roads&#13;
required to conduct credible elections, and extended its implementation period to 2011 or 2012.&#13;
The proposed project will support implementation of the PPMRRP. The second phase of the&#13;
PPMRRPwill bepreparedtowards the endo fthe implementationperiod for the first phase.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The overall purpose of the PPMRRP is to consolidate peace and reestablish state&#13;
administration throughout the country, and to initiate the medium and long-term process of&#13;
reconstruction and economic rehabilitation. Specific objectives are to: (a) address the immediate&#13;
needs of the poorest people and displaced population; (b) rapidly improve the quality of life of&#13;
people living in both rural and urban areas by expanding access to vital public services; (c)&#13;
reestablish critical transportation links throughout the country and, in particular, to reconnect the&#13;
provinces most affected by the war-Bit,       Huambo, Moxico, Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul, Uige,&#13;
Cuando Cubango and Malanje; (d) enhance food security and start to revive the rural economy,&#13;
especially in the provinces most affected by war; and (e) strengthen capacity o f government at all&#13;
levels to formulate, prepare, implement, and manage medium and long-term development&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PART 2: BANKRESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.        Rationalefor Bankinvolvement&#13;
&#13;
23.       The objectives of Bank engagement in Angola laid out in the Interim Strategy Note for&#13;
2007-08 are: (a) strengthening public sector management and government institutional capacity,&#13;
(b) supporting the rebuilding of critical infrastructure and the improvement of service delivery for&#13;
poverty reduction, and (c) promoting growth of non-mineral sectors. The EMRP operations (phases&#13;
1 and 2) are helping the Bank achieve all three objectives. First, they are assisting in improving&#13;
public sector management through establishment of sound systems o f project management inall its&#13;
aspects, from project selection to procurement planning and execution, internal controls, auditing&#13;
(including physical and value-for-money auditing), monitoring and evaluation, and preparation and&#13;
maintenance o f project documentation and record keeping. Although the main beneficiary of these&#13;
efforts will be the PMIU inthe Ministry of Planning, participating line ministries and agencies will&#13;
also benefit from capacity building support. The EMRP-specific capacity building support will&#13;
complement the work of the Economic Management Technical Assistance to strengthen public&#13;
sector more generally. The EMRP operations are also helpingto buildcapacity o f local administra-&#13;
tions for decentralized service delivery. Second, they are contributing to the rehabilitation of&#13;
critical infrastructure and delivery of public services through investments inroads, bridges, electric-&#13;
ity, water, urban infrastructure, (under phase 1) health and education services. They will help in&#13;
reducingpoverty by targeting support to six of Angola's most war-affected provinces: Bit, Moxico,&#13;
Kwanza Norte, Luanda, Uige and Malanje (map 1). These provinces are home to about 58 percent&#13;
o f Angola's population and are expected to receive some 30 percent o f the internally displaced&#13;
people returninghome. Moreover, these provinces have also received much less public resources&#13;
than others. Third, the EMRP operations are helpingto promote growth o f non-mineral sectors by&#13;
improving the investment climate (through improved public sector management and governance&#13;
and through enhanced infrastructure) and through revitalizing agriculture in particular (through&#13;
support for buildingcapacity o f extension services and seed multiplication and for feeder roads).&#13;
&#13;
24.       The Bank has unique knowledge and analytical capacity to help with the design and&#13;
implementation o f complex multisector projects that combine investments with institutional&#13;
strengthening. Thus, although the resources from the Bank for rehabilitation o f infrastructure in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                          Map 1: Targeted provinces&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.     The EhfRPo&#13;
ensure that all arc as                                 le, EMRP Iand 2&#13;
are laying thc loun&#13;
&#13;

                                     6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
productivity and marketing o f farm goods. Similarly, they are providing support to deliver clean&#13;
water to people currently without adequate services, while a proposed water project aimed at&#13;
strengthening water sector institutions will follow. They are coordinating closely with the Third&#13;
Social Investment Fund to ensure that support for decentralization complements that o f the social&#13;
fund. They are also working in close coordination with the Economic Management Technical&#13;
Assistance Project to broaden the impact o f the support o f both for improved public sector&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The activities that comprise the proposed EMRPhave been selected because they:&#13;
&#13;
0       Are consistent with the strategies o f the government and o f the Bank.&#13;
0       Address the most urgent needs and priorities for social services and economic recovery.&#13;
0       Support good governance and effective decentralization.&#13;
0       Support activities that complement those o f other donors.&#13;
0       Are likely to mobilize additional donor support.&#13;
0       Are relatively simple and straightforwardto implement.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Lessonslearned,reflectedinthe designof the overallprogramandIDA-financed&#13;
        projects&#13;
&#13;
27.     Five key lessons are reflected inthe design o f both phase 1 and phase 2. Inaddition, phase 2&#13;
has beenadapted to buildon the lessons learned duringthe first year o fimplementationo fphase 1:&#13;
&#13;
0       Given Angola's limited administrative capacity and weak record on governance, the project&#13;
        will be implemented using the ring-fenced approach, while also incorporating specific&#13;
        measures to build capacity o f government over time for sound project and fiduciary&#13;
        management.&#13;
&#13;
0       Activities are being designed comprehensively and in an integrated manner to ensure&#13;
        coherence and synergy between sectors. Inaddition, work on roads, water supply systems,&#13;
        electricity, and the like will be closely coordinated to ensure that work i s properly&#13;
        sequenced and that bottlenecks are minimized.&#13;
&#13;
0       Government agencies are deeply involved in the preparation o f the activities and will be&#13;
        involved in implementation. This will build ownership and capacity to undertake future&#13;
        projects.&#13;
&#13;
0       Activities have been identified and designed with the participation o f all key stakeholders,&#13;
        including civil society organizations, development partners, and the private sector,&#13;
        whenever feasible. This will help to ensure that resources are spent wisely and that benefits&#13;
        are widely shared.&#13;
&#13;
0       Only the highest priority tasks have been selected for the EMRP given the limited&#13;
        absorptive capacity and the constraints to secure full financing for the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PART 3: DETAILEDPROGRAMAND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
A.      Programand Projectobjectives&#13;
&#13;
28.     The overall purpose o f the program is to help to build the foundation for long-term&#13;
reconstruction, economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment o f state administration throughout&#13;
the country. The specific objectives o f the EMRP 2 are to assist the government to: (a) facilitate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agricultural marketing in specific areas with high agricultural potential that have been affected by&#13;
the conflict; (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure; and (c) strengthen capacity o f&#13;
participating ministries and agencies for improved governance and transparency and o f local&#13;
governments for future decentralization. These objectives build on the objectives and activities o f&#13;
EMRP 1andare consistent with the ECPthe PPMRRP.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Program phasing&#13;
&#13;
29.      Although presented as a program, the EMRP i s a single project split into two phases by&#13;
necessity, rather than by design. It i s not an Adaptable Program Credit. Due to less than expected&#13;
financing under IDA 13, the Bank in2005 could finance only a part o f its intended contribution to&#13;
the overall emergency program. It was therefore decided to split the operation into two phases,&#13;
with the second phase to be financed under IDA 14. Inresponse to feedback from the Bank's&#13;
Board during discussions o f EMRP 1, the second phase has been simplified and the size o f the&#13;
credit reduced. Unlike phase 1, phase 2 will support only reconstruction or rehabilitation o f critical&#13;
infrastructure and o f feeder roads. It will not support health, education, or agriculture (except for&#13;
feeder roads), areas that were supported in EMRP 1. Measures to strengthen governance o f both&#13;
project management and o f general government operations have been added to EMRP2.&#13;
&#13;
30.      EMRP 1is supportingactivitiesthat address the most urgent needs andcanbe implemented&#13;
quickly.    These include: (a) activities to restart agriculture (particularly production and&#13;
multiplication o f seeds and planting material); (b) provision o f essential drugs, logistical support,&#13;
and refresher courses for nurses and auxiliary nurses to improve health services; (c) provision o f&#13;
teaching and learning materials and assistance to initiate teachers' training; and (d) support to&#13;
restore water services in Luanda and inthree provincial capitals. It i s also supporting: (a) technical&#13;
assistance and capacity building for sector ministries and agencies involved in implementing the&#13;
project to build local capacity for decentralization; (b) initial training programs; and (c) preparation&#13;
o f the environmental and social impact assessment for the overall project, and the social and&#13;
environmental management plan for phase 1 activities. Finally, it i s financing the management,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation o f the implementation o f phase 1 (including setting up the project&#13;
management unit and strengthening it especially with regard to fiduciary and safeguards aspects)&#13;
and engineering studies (detailed design, tender documents) and preparatory activities for phase 2&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
31.      EMRP 2 will build on the activities o f EMRP 1 and focus on upgrading infrastructure,&#13;
supporting rehabilitation or construction o f feeder roads, trunk roads (including bridges), electricity&#13;
services, rural water supply, water supply in a provincial capital, and urban infrastructure. It will&#13;
also support the preparation o f the medium-tern sector strategies,                 capacity building,&#13;
decentralization and local development, and continue support for program and project management.&#13;
&#13;
 C.      Progress of phase 1&#13;
&#13;
32.      EMRP phase 1 was approved by the Board on February 17, 2005 and became effective on&#13;
M a y 12, 2005. Phase 1 helped set up the project management and implementation unit (PMIU)&#13;
within the Ministry o f Planning. This institution was designed in consultation with the Bank's&#13;
financial management and procurement staff to ensure the project i s implemented in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's fiduciary safeguards and that funds are used as intended, to undertake environment&#13;
and social impact assessments for both phases, and to monitor and report on progress with project&#13;
implementation and outcomes. The project coordinator i s the Vice Minister o f Planning, supported&#13;
bya highlevel advisor (under FrenchDevelopment Cooperation funding).&#13;
&#13;

33.      Progress with implementation o f phase 1 i s generally satisfactory, despite a delay o f some&#13;
twelve months in implementation compared to the original plan, due in large part to difficulties in&#13;
recruiting suitable international staff required to ensure that the project funds are used as intended.&#13;
The PMIU i s now fully staffed and includes internationally recruited financial management and&#13;
procurement specialists,     and nationally recruited accountants,       procurement officers,     and&#13;
administrative staff. The government has complied with all fiduciary-related dated covenants inthe&#13;
financing agreement. The internal auditor and the independent external auditing firm have been&#13;
selected and recruited according to the Bank procedures and guidelines. Audit reports o f project&#13;
accounts have been produced and submitted in time to the Bank. Selection o f the firm for the&#13;
environmental and social impact assessment (safeguards) and for assistance in implementation o f&#13;
the environmental management plan i s well advanced, following delays due to the changing&#13;
activities o f phase 2 and to delays in its approval. The government did not want to proceed with&#13;
this activity untilapproval o fphase 2 was assured, since the most o fthe major investments that the&#13;
environmental and social assessment will address will take place under phase 2 financing.&#13;
&#13;
34.      EMRP 1 disbursements are currently some twelve months behind schedule because&#13;
preparation o f the detailed design and tender documents for roads (including feeder roads) and&#13;
electricity facilities was delayed (due to the delays in approval o f phase 2 and the subsequent&#13;
change in activities).   Supervision missions have all rated the project marginally satisfactory or&#13;
satisfactory and noted that the pace o f implementation i s accelerating, especially for the water,&#13;
education, and agriculture components. A full-time health specialist is being recruited by the&#13;
government to follow up on implementation the health component. This, with the quick assessment&#13;
o f the drugs needs being carried out, will help speed up implementation o f the health component.&#13;
The government has launched or i s launching requests for proposals for the preparation o f the&#13;
detailed design and tender documents (for electricity, water, roads, and feeder roads), which are&#13;
planned to be completed by July 2007 and will therefore enable speedy implementation o f EMRP&#13;
phase 2. The request for proposals for preparation o f detailed design and tender documents for the&#13;
trunk road has been delayed, due to uncertainties arising from the delays in Bank approval of&#13;
EMRP2. The contracts for procurement o ftextbooks andteachers guides have been awarded. The&#13;
Ministryof Educationrecruited an education project officer to assist inthe implementation of the&#13;
education component. The Ministry o f Education has also requested funding to finance a number&#13;
o f studies related to teacher management, school inspection, and school management. Equipment,&#13;
vehicles, and logistics support services needed to reestablish the institutional capacity o f Angola's&#13;
two agriculture research centers and o f rural extension services inthe provinces o f Malanje and BiC&#13;
have been procured, and training was provided to extension workers, researchers, and producers'&#13;
organizations. Seeds for multiplication have been procured, and preparation o f detailed design and&#13;
tender documents for feeder roads has been launched. Procurement o f drugs and logistic support&#13;
services for the health component are being processed. Two out o f three water contracts have been&#13;
awarded. The third will be partly awarded by M a y 2007, and the remaining part will only be&#13;
awarded once phase 2 i s approved to cover an estimated US$14million financing gap for the phase&#13;
1 water component. Selection and recruitment o f the environmental and social firm for safeguards&#13;
environmentalaction plan management i s being finalized. The preparation o f a study laying out the&#13;
options for decentralization has been completed, under UNDP financing, and comments were&#13;
submitted by the Bank. Capacity o f provincial and municipal officials, communities, and local&#13;
contractors to plan, budget, implement and monitor small-scale rural infrastructure i s now being&#13;
built under UNDP financing and UNCDF technical support.                 The Bank will help support&#13;
establishment o f fiscal transfer mechanisms, based on the results o f a pilot. UNDP, through&#13;
UNCDF, is responsible for coordination of all decentralization efforts, including those under the&#13;
Bank-financed Third Social Action Fund. Once the third contract for water infrastructure has been&#13;
awarded, over 80 percent o f EMRP 1funds will have been committed, and disbursements will pick&#13;
up significantly. Progressis summarized intable 1.&#13;

&#13;
   36.         The PPMRRP was estimated to cost about US$1,997 million inclusive of taxes and contin-&#13;
   gencies (table 2). The EMRP (phases 1and 2) i s estimated to cost about US$225 million (see table&#13;
   2 and 3). IDA financing is estimated to be US$153 million equivalent (including contingencies)&#13;
   (table 4), about 68 percent o f the costs o f the project and some 8 percent of the cost of the&#13;
   PPMRRP. The government will finance about 27 percent of the project costs, includingtaxes and&#13;
   duties. Other donors (European Union, UNDP, and the French Development Cooperation) are&#13;
   committed to financing some 5 percent.&#13;

38.       Phase 2 of the EMRP i s estimated to cost about US$133 million. IDA financing i s&#13;
estimated to be about US$102 million equivalent including contingencies, about 76 percent of the&#13;
costs of phase 2 (see table 4). The government i s financing about 23 percent, including taxes and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             12&#13;

percent.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Program andProject components&#13;
&#13;
39.      The proposed phase 2 of the program comprises the same four components as phase 1,&#13;
although with different activities: (a) rural development (which includes only feeder roads); (b)&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure (roads and bridges, electricity, water&#13;
supply, and urban infrastructure); (c) strengthening of human and institutional capacity, develop-&#13;
ment of sector strategies, and decentralization; and (d) management and monitoring of the project.&#13;
&#13;
 ComponentA: Rural developmentand delivery of social services&#13;
&#13;
40.      Rural development (US13 million, of which IDA will contribute US$9 million). This&#13;
component will support for rural development, by financing the rehabilitation o f some 600&#13;
kilometers ofrural roads.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Objectives. The subcomponent aims to facilitate access of rural residents to markets and&#13;
social services through the rehabilitation o f select feeder roads. Activitieswill take place primarily&#13;
in two provinces, Malanje and BiC, because these provinces are major producers of cassava and&#13;
maize, basic staples for Angolans.&#13;
&#13;
42.      Activities. The project will support the rehabilitation of some 600 kilometers o f rural roads,&#13;
300 kilometers in each of Malanje and BiC provinces for an estimated total base cost o f US$10&#13;
million over a period of 24 months. The final selection of roads among some 750 kilometers&#13;
initially identified and being studied will depend on the financial costs to be determined by field&#13;
surveys and engineering designs, which are underway. A tentative selection of the roads to be&#13;
rehabilitatedi s presentedintable 5.&#13;

&#13;
Water and sanitation subcomponent (US$25 million of whichIDA is contributing US$25million)&#13;
&#13;
51.      Objectives. The objectives of the water and sanitation subcomponent are to increase access&#13;
to supply o f safe drinkingwater inthe periurbanareas o f Luanda and the three provincial capitals of&#13;
Malanje, Kuito, and N'Dalatando.&#13;
&#13;
52.      Activities. The project will support water services in N'Dalatando and in rural areas o f&#13;
Moxico. All detailed design and tender documents have been completed under phase 1, tenders for&#13;
works have been launched and contracts have beenawarded. However, some US$14 million would&#13;
need to be secured from phase 2 to be able to award the water contracts under phase 1, given the&#13;
shortage o f funds of phase 1 to fully finance the water component. The project will also provide&#13;
technical assistance to strengthen the water utility. Specifically, the project will rehabilitate 35&#13;
kilometers o f the water network, provide 3,500 house connections, and construct 50 community&#13;
standpipes. Inrural areas inthe province of Moxico, the project will finance the constructionof 70&#13;
boreholes with hand pumps, and rehabilitate five small systems and 50 water points. The new&#13;
water points and small water systems will be managed by community organizations, which are&#13;
expected to collect adequate revenues through water charges to cover costs of operations and&#13;
maintenance. UNICEF will implement the activities inrural areas. The project under component C&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will also provide technical assistanceto the National Directorate of Water (DNA) and the Ministry&#13;
o f Energy and Water to reform policy and regulations for water services and to undertake future&#13;
public expenditure tracking studies.     In the three provincial capitals, the project will finance&#13;
technical assistance to help the water utilities provide water services on a commercial basis, fully&#13;
covering costs for operations and maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
53.      Costs.  The estimated costs for the subcomponent total about US$28 million under&#13;
component B and C (see table 9). IDA will finance about US$25 million or 100 percent o f the total.&#13;
Detailedcosts are giveninappendix 6.&#13;

54.      Urban services (US$ 17 million of which IDA will contribute US$I2 million). The project&#13;
through phase 1component D i s financing part of studies and preparation of detailed designs for the&#13;
works to be rehabilitatedunder EMPR 2.&#13;
&#13;
55.      Objectives. The objectives o f the urban services subcomponent are to prevent overflows of&#13;
sewage at critical points from the combined drainage and sewerage collection system in Luanda,&#13;
and to control erosion inMoxico province, which i s at risko fnatural disaster.&#13;
&#13;
56.     Activities. The subcomponent will finance a rapid assessment o f the drainage and sewerage&#13;
collection systems in Luanda and emergency repairs to prevent overflows of sewage, and studies,&#13;
equipment, and civil works to control erosioninMoxico. The project will also assist the provincial&#13;
Directorate of Public Works to prioritize interventions in marginal urban areas in Luanda, where&#13;
risks of major disasters are high.&#13;
&#13;
57.      Costs. The estimated cost i s about US$17 million (see table 10). IDA will finance about&#13;
US$12 million, about 70 percent of the total. Details of costs are presentedinappendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
58.      Sector development strategies and strengthening of human and institutional capacities&#13;
(US$8 million, of which IDA is contributing US$7 million). This component will support the&#13;
development o f different strategies, decentralization pilot and capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
59.     Activities. The project will support preparation of strategiesinthree key sectors: electricity,&#13;
transport, and water. It will assist preparation of a national transport strategy to help the govem-&#13;
ment to manage the transport sector. It will support the development and implementation of a&#13;
private sector participationstrategy. This subcomponent will also finance pilots to test mechanisms&#13;
and policies on decentralization intended to strengthen local capacity for decentralization (all&#13;
decentralization efforts and actions, including those o f the Social Action Funds, are coordinated&#13;
with the assistance ofUNDP). Itwill also finance the management of environmental aspectsof the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
60.     Infrastructure studies.    In recognition o f the need for substantial improvements in&#13;
infrastructural services, the government started opening up infrastructure to private sector&#13;
participation during the second half o f the 1990s. While the experience to date o f involving the&#13;
private sector in infrastructure remains quite limited, the government has established a good track&#13;
record o freformingpolicy and o f implementingprojects.&#13;
&#13;
61.     To assist the government in deepening and accelerating infrastructure reforms, the Public&#13;
Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, jointly with the Bank, initiated in 2002 a strategic study&#13;
entitled "Country Framework Report" on private participation in infrastructure.            The study,&#13;
completed in December 2003, included a framework for developing Angola's infrastructure sectors&#13;
during 2004-25 through greater private participation.       It covered electricity, natural gas, water&#13;
supply and sanitation, solid waste, telecommunications, airports, seaports, roads and bridges, and&#13;
railways.&#13;
&#13;
62.     Support for implementation o f the strategy under the project includes preparatory work to&#13;
underpin future policy reforms. However, as agreed with the government, the implementation o f&#13;
such reforms would not be included in the project, but would be part o f the next phase o f Angola's&#13;
development program.&#13;
&#13;
63.     Inadditionto some specific studies, thisactivity willprovide some technical assistance and&#13;
training for the ministries responsible for infrastructure, as well as for the provincial governments,&#13;
and sector agencies. Appendix 8 provides a detailed descriptiono f the proposedactivities.&#13;
&#13;
64.     Decentralization and support for local development.           Decentralization has been and&#13;
remains a central concern o f the government o f Angola. The Council adopted a strategic plan for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decentralization. This was followed by a study on decentralization and deconcentration supported&#13;
by UNDP that developed a local governance approach with a clearly sequenced set of activities to&#13;
implementthe strategic plan.&#13;
&#13;
65.      Objectives. The main objective o f the activity i s to help build capacity of the municipal&#13;
administration to plan and manage the delivery of sustainable public services in the longer term.&#13;
Specifically, the activity aims to: (a) establish a model for financing the subnational administra-&#13;
tions' development budget; (b) create a mechanism and practical tools for regular auditing,&#13;
monitoring and financial reporting requirements; (c) build capacity at local level to plan, budget,&#13;
implement, and monitor small-scale rural infrastructure; (d) pilot mechanisms for investment&#13;
programming, budgeting, implementation, assets' management, and accounting. Activities will be&#13;
focused on four municipalities, Kilamba Kiaxi (Luanda province), Kamacupa (BiC), Calandula&#13;
(Malange), and Sanza Pombo (Uige).&#13;
&#13;
66.     Activities. Once a fiscal transfer mechanism being piloted under UNDP finance with&#13;
technical support of the UNCDF has proved satisfactory, the EMRP will support, on a broader&#13;
basis, the establishment of fiscal transfer mechanisms and their corresponding management and&#13;
operational procedures. It will assist both central and local government to: (a) establish the transfer&#13;
mechanisms; (b) draft the management and operational procedures for disbursement of the&#13;
transfers; (c) develop improved procedures for municipal-level strategic planning, programming,&#13;
budgeting, implementation, auditing, monitoring and evaluation; (d) design a framework for&#13;
monitoring local government revenue; (e) conduct a revenue generation feasibility study to&#13;
investigate opportunities for municipalities to generate as well as mobilize income; and (0 assist&#13;
municipalities inthe implementationo f selected actions.&#13;
&#13;
67.      Costs. The decentralization and support to local governance subcomponent i s estimated to&#13;
cost about US$2.4 million. IDA will finance about US$1.9 million. Details o f the costs are&#13;
provided in appendix 3,&#13;
&#13;
 ComponentD: Management, monitoring and evaluation ofproject implementation&#13;
&#13;
68.     Management, monitoring and evaluation ofproject implementation (US$7 million, of which&#13;
IDA is contributing US$3 million). This component is financing project management and monitor-&#13;
ing and evaluation of implementation. It i s also financing preparation o f detaileddesign and tender&#13;
documents for investment activities. Specifically, this component will finance technical assistance,&#13;
consultant services, operating costs, logistical support, and equipment to complement project&#13;
management and monitoring and evaluation. This component will also help to build capacity of&#13;
participatingministries and agencies for transparent project management, with a particular focus on&#13;
procurement and financial management through on-the-job training, establishment o f modem&#13;
financial management systems, and other assistance. This i s expected to strengthen governance of&#13;
the participatingministries and agencies.&#13;

B.       Capacity of the governmentto executethe project&#13;
&#13;
70.      The capacity o f the government of Angola to execute the EMRP (phases 1 and 2) in&#13;
accordance with Bank procedures i s weak. National regulations cannot be used for the project&#13;
according to the country procurement assessment review carried out in 2002, because o f major&#13;
problems with transparency, enforcement and capacity. An action plan addressing the recommen-&#13;
dations of the procurement review i s being implemented through the ongoing Economic Manage-&#13;
ment Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 3744-AO).             Agreement has been reached with the&#13;
government on the implementation arrangements for EMRP (phase 1 and phase 2) to mitigate risks,&#13;
to compensate for government's weaknesses, and to strengthen government capacity to implement&#13;
future development projects.      These arrangements (see below) are already in place and are&#13;
fimctioning well.&#13;
&#13;
 C.      Programandprojectimplementationandmanagementstructure&#13;
&#13;
71.      Project oversight. An interministerial steering committee put into place under EMRP 1,&#13;
chaired by the Ministry o f Planning and comprising vice ministers (or their delegates) o f finance&#13;
and sectoral ministries involved inthe project, will be responsible for overall project oversight.&#13;
&#13;
72.      Project management.      Given the emergency nature o f the project, the relatively large&#13;
number o f activities to be completed within a short time frame, and the limited capacity of the&#13;
government, the following institutional arrangements have been agreed (and are being used to&#13;
implement phase 1 activities) to ensure that funds disburse quickly, multisectoral objectives are&#13;
reached, and absolute transparency i s maintained.&#13;
&#13;
73.      A PMIU has been set up by ministerial decree (Despacho 0067/GMP/2004) within the&#13;
Ministryof Planning to be responsible for overall management of EMRP 1and 2. It is headed by&#13;
the Vice Minister o f Planning (who i s also the secretary o f the steering committee) as project&#13;
coordinator supported by a high-level advisor (under French Cooperation funding). The PMIU&#13;
works in coordination with relevant ministries and agencies.          It has three main functions: (a)&#13;
procurement; (b) financial management; and (c) monitoring and evaluation o f project implementa-&#13;
tion.  It is also responsible for: (a) ensuring progress o f procurement in accordance with an&#13;
implementation schedule reviewed and approved by the World Bank; (b) ensuring that the&#13;
international procurement experts transfer skills to the local staff, as specified intheir contracts; and&#13;
(c) ensuring highethical standards and transparency. Finally, the PMIU i s responsible for ensuring&#13;
that project implementation complies with World Bank procurement, financial management, and&#13;
disbursement rules. Despite some delays at the start o f the implementation o f phase 1, the PMIUi s&#13;
performing satisfactorily and fulfilling its duties as expected.&#13;
&#13;
74.      The line ministries and participating entities are monitoring implementation and providing&#13;
the PMIUwith periodic monitoring reports o f progress, inaccordance with contracts that they have&#13;
signed. The roles and responsibilities o f the PMIU in relation to the line ministries and other&#13;
entities participating inthe project are specified inmemoranda o f understanding signed between the&#13;
PMIUand the ministries andnational entities.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Procurementand disbursementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
75.      Procurement. Procurement o f works, goods, and services under the EMRP will follow the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines o f M a y 2004. The thresholds for the use o f different procurement methods&#13;
are presented in the technical annex for the project and will be specified in the Financing Agree-&#13;
ment. The thresholds for prior review by the Bank o f the recipient's procurement decisions are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
specified in the procurement plan agreed during negotiations. The two kinds of thresholds have&#13;
been set relatively low to permit greater scrutiny and reduce the procurement risk. About 95 per-&#13;
cent of the total value o f contracts (about 75 percent of the total of the financing amount) would be&#13;
subject to prior review; regularpost-reviews will be carried out duringproject supervision.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The PMIU handles the procurement for the entire project in collaboration with the&#13;
participating sector ministries and agencies.       The participating ministries and agencies are&#13;
responsible for preparing the initial requirements for procurement, including the terms of reference,&#13;
bills of quantities, specifications, and the like and providing them to the PMIU. The PMIU&#13;
conducts the procurement process up to the award o f contract.            The ministries and agencies&#13;
participate in the preparation of short lists and the evaluation o f bids and proposals under the&#13;
direction of PMIU. The ministers or heads of agencies concerned sign the contracts and are&#13;
responsible for the management of the contracts. The PMIU monitors contract management and&#13;
assists the ministries and agencies in this task as needed. Payments for contracts are made by the&#13;
PMIU against certification received from the ministry or agency responsible for the particular&#13;
contract.   These arrangements were based on lessons learned in implementing post-conflict&#13;
reconstruction operations insimilar environments.&#13;
&#13;
77.      For phase 2, and based on the lessons learned from phase 1, the PMIU will maintain a&#13;
procurement section, headed by an internationally recruited chief procurement officer and staffed&#13;
with procurement officers, recruited nationally. If needed, other procurement officers, recruited&#13;
nationally will join the PMIU. The project implementation plan, under preparation, contains a&#13;
section on procurement, which will incorporate the procurement manuals that have already been&#13;
prepared for phase 1, updated to take into account procurement specific to phase 2.&#13;
&#13;
78.      Procurement for the project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated May 2004; and Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers dated May 2004; and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement for the project. The items in the different&#13;
procurement categories are briefly described below. The Bank's standard bidding documents,&#13;
including those for evaluation reports, will be used for all procurement under International&#13;
Competitive Bidding(ICB) and National Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures.&#13;
&#13;
79.      Procurement plans. A procurement plan for project implementation, which will govern the&#13;
choice o f the procurement methods used for all the contracts, was prepared duringpost-appraisal of&#13;
phase 2 and agreed at negotiations. This will be updated prior to project start. For every contract&#13;
that would be financed out of the credit, the plan specifies the procurement method or consultant&#13;
selection method to be used, whether there is a need for prequalification, the estimated cost, prior&#13;
review requirements, and a timeframe. The plan agreed on between the recipient and the Bank at&#13;
negotiations i s presented in appendix 11. The procurement plan will be updated annually, or more&#13;
frequently as required, to reflect the project implementation needs and improvements in the&#13;
institutional capacity. Any proposed revisions to the agreedprocurement plan will be submitted to&#13;
the Bank for its prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
80.      Procurement of goods. Goods procured under the phase 2 would include vehicles, trucks,&#13;
motorbikes, computer hardware and software, office equipment, pumps, and other water-related&#13;
equipment, and the like. Each contract for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or&#13;
more would be procured under ICB procedures, except for meters for the electricity component&#13;
which will be procured under NCB. Goods with a total estimated value per contract of less than&#13;
US$200,000 may be procured on the basis of NCB. Goods estimated to cost less than US$30,000&#13;
per contract may beprocuredon thebasis of Shopping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81.      Procurement of works. Works procuredunder this project would include the rehabilitation,&#13;
reconstruction, or expansion of roads, electric power supply, water and sanitation, and urban works.&#13;
Works with a total estimated total value per contract of US$l,OOO,OOO or more will be procured on&#13;
the basis of ICB. Prequalification will be done for works contracts o f U S 1 0 million or more.&#13;
Works with an estimated value per contract o f less than US$l,OOO,OOO may be procured on the&#13;
basis o f NCB. Works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract may be procured on the&#13;
basis of Shopping. Shopping procedures involve at least 3 quotations from suppliers or contractors&#13;
in response to a written invitation. For electricity supply, the standard bidding documents for&#13;
Supply and Installationof Plant and Equipmentwill be used. Where appropriate, LimitedInterna-&#13;
tional Bidding(LIB)for works may be used, as agreedinthe procurement plans.&#13;
&#13;
82.      Selection of consultants. Consultant services will be requiredfor the design o f most of the&#13;
civil works included in the project, construction supervision, studies, and technical assistance for&#13;
project implementation. Consultant services will be procured through a Quality-and-Cost-Based&#13;
Selection (QCBS) or other appropriate methods as specified inthe procurement plans. Consultant&#13;
assignments estimated to cost US$200,000 or more would be advertised to invite expressions of&#13;
interest. Small consulting assignmentsmay beprocured through Consultant Qualification Selection&#13;
(CQS) or Least Cost Selection (LCS). Technical assistance to municipal health teams would be&#13;
provided in four provinces through a QCBS procedure with a short list consisting only of qualified&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Single-Source Selection (SSS) may be used in exceptional cases, where the provisions of&#13;
paragraphs 3.9 to 3.13 of the Consultants Guidelines are met. Inphase 2, construction supervision&#13;
assignments may be procured through SSS, provided that the original selection o f consultants to&#13;
prepare the design or studies (under phase 1) was carried out through competition and for the entire&#13;
assignment coveringbothphases 1 and 2.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Specialized advisory services would be procured through Individual Consultants Selection&#13;
(ICs), based on the qualifications o f individual consultants for the assignment in accordance with&#13;
the provisions ofparagraphs 5.1 through 5.3 ofthe Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
85.      Procurement from UN agencies. Procurement from United Nations agencies for supplies&#13;
and works carried out under their own procedures may include UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, UNCDF&#13;
and the International Agency Procurement Services Organization. The standard form o f contract&#13;
with UNagencies will be used for such procurement. The items to be procured from UNagencies&#13;
would be agreed on in the procurement plans and would originally include: (a) the construction of&#13;
rural water supply systems with UNICEF for an estimated contract value of US$4.2 million; and (b)&#13;
implementation o f the studies and capacity building for the pilot decentralization activity through&#13;
UNDP andUNCDF.&#13;
&#13;
86.      Training. Workshops and study tours will be conducted according to annual training&#13;
programs that will be submitted to IDA for review prior to initiating the training. The programs&#13;
will specify the type of training (courses, study tours, workshops, on thejob, and others), subjects,&#13;
number o f trainees, duration of training, staff months, timing, estimated cost, and the like. The&#13;
procurement of any training activities that involve the hiring of consultants will follow the&#13;
Consultants Guidelines by using the QCBS, CQS or LCS for firms and ICs for individuals. The&#13;
appropriate methods will be specified inthe procurement plans.&#13;
&#13;
87.      Operating costs. Operating costs financed through the project would be procuredusingthe&#13;
PMIU's administrative procedures, as laid inthe manual o f administrative and financial procedures&#13;
which was reviewedand found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88.      Grants. Grants may cover the cost o f grants or other mitigation measures within the&#13;
framework o f the environmental and social impact assessment according to the World Bank&#13;
safeguard guidelines. They will also cover decentralization support grants to be disbursed through&#13;
the appropriate government budget line to benefit selected municipalities once the appropriate&#13;
framework and mechanisms have been agreed on to the satisfaction of IDA. Disbursement for&#13;
environmental and social mitigation grants will not be made until the environmental and social&#13;
assessment (under phase 1)has been completed and the environmental and social mitigation system&#13;
i s inplace.&#13;
&#13;
89.      Direct contracting. Direct contracting for works and goods may be used in exceptional&#13;
cases, such as for the extension o f an existing contract, standardization, proprietary items, spare&#13;
parts for existing equipment, and urgent repairs and emergency situations, according to paragraphs&#13;
3.6 and 3.7 of the Guidelines. The items to be procuredthrough direct contracting would be agreed&#13;
on inthe procurement plan.&#13;
&#13;
90.      Prior review of procurement by the World Bank. The thresholds for prior review by the&#13;
Bank are specified in the procurement plans. Table 11 shows: (a) the thresholds for the different&#13;
procurement methods, and (b) the initially-agreed thresholds for prior review by the Bank. The&#13;
Bank will previewprocurement arrangements proposed by the Recipient for the items specified in&#13;
the procurement plans for their conformity with the Financing Agreement and the applicable&#13;
Guidelines. Any procurement itemnot specified for prior reviewmay be subjected to a post-review&#13;
o f the procurement process. The prior review thresholds may berevisited at mid-term review based&#13;
on the performance of the PMIU.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Therefore, although the overall risk for procurement in the country i s high, given the measures&#13;
already in place for the project, and given that all procurement carried out to date under phase 1 i s&#13;
satisfactory, the overall project risk for procurement has been upgraded from high to average.&#13;
&#13;
94.     The thresholds for the methods o f procurement for phase 2 and for the prior review by the&#13;
Bank would be the same as for phase 1 in spite o f the change in the project's procurement risk&#13;
rating.  This is partly because the overall national risk remains high and partly to maintain&#13;
continuity with the implementation procedures that are being followed for phase 1. The recom-&#13;
mended frequency o f procurement supervision is likewise unchanged from phase 1. Thus, the&#13;
mitigating measures for phase 2 correspond more to the requirements o f high project risk, rather&#13;
than one o f average project risk.&#13;
&#13;
95.     Frequency of procurement supervision.          The frequency o f procurement supervision i s&#13;
proposed to be once every four months in the first year and once every six months in subsequent&#13;
years. Every supervision mission should also include a post-review o fprocurement decisions.&#13;
&#13;
96.      Audits o fprocurement and disbursement o f IDA and government funds will be undertaken&#13;
at regular intervals by internal and external auditors.       Appendix 9 presents the details o f the&#13;
procurement arrangements based on the assessments carriedout by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Disbursement arrangements&#13;
&#13;
97.     Disbursement.      All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. The government will finance&#13;
100 percent of: (a) taxes and duties (estimated at a rate o f 10 percent) except for the subcomponents&#13;
related to water supply, and grants for mitigation o f environmental and social risks, (b) expendi-&#13;
tures for operation and maintenance services; (c) recurrent costs related to the investments made&#13;
under IDA financing; and (d) salaries o f civil servants and office space inthe ministries for project&#13;
purposes. Inaddition, the government will finance (a) 30 percent o f counterpart funding for works&#13;
and goods under component A and B (except for the subcomponent on water supply which will&#13;
continue to be 100 percent IDA financed), and (b) 30 percent o f counterpart funding for technical&#13;
assistance and engineering and consultant services and training. The disbursement schedule i s&#13;
expected to be as follows: US$9 million (9 percent) i s expected to be disbursed duringIDA fiscal&#13;
year fiscal 2008, US$29 million (28 percent) during fiscal 2009, US$35 million (34 percent) during&#13;
fiscal 2010, US$25 million (25 percent) during fiscal 2011, and US$4 million (4 percent) during&#13;
fiscal 2012. Disbursement o f grants to mitigate environmental and social risks will not be made&#13;
until the environmental and social assessment (under phase 1) has been completed and the&#13;
environmental and social mitigation system i s inplace.&#13;
&#13;
98.     Designated Account. The phase 2 project will have one Designated Account that will be&#13;
opened ina commercial bank acceptable to IDA and will be operated in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
99.      Disbursements from IDA would be initially made on the basis o f details o f eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements).       IDA would then make advance disbursements&#13;
from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing into a recipient-operated Designated Account to&#13;
expedite project implementation. The advance to the Designated Account would be used by the&#13;
Recipientto finance IDA share o fproject expenditures. Another acceptable method o f withdrawing&#13;
funds from the Credit is the direct payment method, involvingdirect payments from the Credit to a&#13;
thirdparty for works, goods and services upon the recipient's request. Payments may also be made&#13;
to a commercial bank for expenditures against IDA special commitments covering a commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA'SDisbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for&#13;
direct payment and special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
100.    To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works, and services a&#13;
Designated Account with an authorized allocation o f US$8.5 million will be provided, covering an&#13;
estimated four months o f eligible expenditures financed by IDA. Upon Credit effectiveness, the&#13;
PMIU would submit a withdrawal application for an initial deposit to the Designated Account&#13;
drawn fiom the IDA Credit, for implementation o f phase 2, for an amount not to exceed US$4.25&#13;
million. The P M I U would submit a withdrawal application for the remaining balance of US$4.25&#13;
million when the aggregate amount o f withdrawals fiom the credit account plus the total amount o f&#13;
all outstanding special commitments entered into by IDA shall be equal or exceed the equivalent o f&#13;
SDR6.2 million for phase 2. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the Designated Account will be&#13;
made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in statements o f expendi-&#13;
ture or on full documentation for payments above thresholds for statements o f expenditure. The&#13;
Designated Account would be used for all payments inferior to about 20 percent o f the authorized&#13;
allocation and replenishment applications would be required to be submitted regularly on a monthly&#13;
basis. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made fiom the Designated Account, the&#13;
recipient will be obligated to refund the same. Ifthe Designated Account remains inactive for more&#13;
than six months, the recipient may be requested to refund to IDA amounts advanced to the&#13;
Designated Account. IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Financing Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o f the funds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
101.     Use of statements of expenditure. All applications for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the&#13;
Credit will be fully documented, except for (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than&#13;
US$l,OOO,OOO for works packages; (b) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$200,000&#13;
for goods; (c) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and&#13;
less than US$50,000 for individual consultants; (d) grants; (e) operating costs; and (0 training.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against statements o f expenditure will be&#13;
retained by PMKJ, and will be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions&#13;
and auditors. All disbursements are subject to the condition o f the Financing Agreement and the&#13;
procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
102.     When project implementation begins, the quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial management&#13;
capacity i s enabling PMIU to establish effective financial management and accounting systems,&#13;
which allow it to produce the FMRs. Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely&#13;
basis, and the recipient requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be&#13;
undertaken by the task team leader to determine if the project i s eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time-consuming voucher by&#13;
voucher.&#13;
&#13;
103.     Government project account.       This account will be opened in a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly in this account in accordance&#13;
with project needs. To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, uponproject effectiveness, the government would be required to make an initial deposit to&#13;
the project account o f US$2 million equivalent for EMRP 2 covering an estimated four months o f&#13;
eligible expenditures cofinanced by the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
F.      Financialmanagement arrangementsand audits&#13;
&#13;
104.    The public expenditure management and financial accountability review carried out by IDA&#13;
incollaborationwiththe government inMarch2004 revealed that themeasurestakenso far arenot&#13;
yet adequate to ensure that Bank-financed projects are managed transparently and in accordance&#13;
with the Bank fiduciary safeguards. The many existing off-budget accounts, a not yet fully&#13;
implemented financial management information system, inadequate systems o f internal control and&#13;
financial reporting, and inadequate external auditing, raise concerns. Despite some recent progress,&#13;
caution i s required.   Overall project financial management risk i s rated substantial, a slight&#13;
improvement on the highrisk rating for phase 1 (see appendix 10). The improvement arises from&#13;
the experience gained from running the first phase, and the success in filling key fiduciary&#13;
positions.  Under these circumstances, the ring-fenced financial management approach, with&#13;
dedicated bank accounts, qualified project staff, and a project financial management manual, will&#13;
continue to be used.&#13;
&#13;
105.    To establish an acceptable control environment and to mitigate risks, measures have been&#13;
specified inthe project's Financial Management Action Plan for phase 1. Implementation o f these&#13;
measuresi s satisfactory as detailed below:&#13;
&#13;
 Action required                                       Status&#13;

&#13;
106.    The PMIU i s requiredto submit a quarterly FMR to the Bank, in accordance with Bank&#13;
guidelines. An FMR includes: (a) a statement o f sources and uses of funds, (b) an up-to-date&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
description o f physical progress, and (c) status o f main procurement actions. The PMIU has&#13;
submitted all required FMRs for EMRP 1on time.&#13;
&#13;
107.    Internal controls and financial management manual.            EMRP internal controls and&#13;
procedures are documented in a financial management manual that has been reviewed by the Bank&#13;
and is considered satisfactory. This i s a document which i s updated as appropriate with any&#13;
changes when they occur. This one document will be used for EMRP 1and 2.&#13;
&#13;
108.    The financial management manual describes (for the accounting system) the major&#13;
transaction cycles o f the project; funds flow processes; the accounting records, the supporting&#13;
documents and the chart o f accounts.        It also summarizes authorization procedures, financial&#13;
reporting process, project's accounting policies, budgeting procedures, financial forecasting&#13;
procedures, procurement and contract administration monitoring procedures, procedures for the&#13;
replenishment o f the Special Account, and auditing arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
109.    Planning and budgeting.        Cash budget preparation follows government procedures.&#13;
Detailed procedures for planning and budgeting are documented in the financial management&#13;
manual.    Financial projections or forecasts are prepared and regularly revised.        The project&#13;
accountants will prepare annually the cash budget for the coming period based on the work&#13;
program. The cash budget includes the figures for the year, analyzed by quarter. The cash budget&#13;
for each quarter reflects the detailed specifications for project activities, schedules (including&#13;
procurementplan), and expenditure on project activities scheduled for the quarter. The annual cash&#13;
budget i s sent to the task team leader at least two months before the beginning o f the project fiscal&#13;
year. These arrangements established under EMRP 1will continue for and include EMRP2.&#13;
&#13;
110.    Accounting policies. IDA and counterpart funds for EMRP 2 will be accounted for on a&#13;
cash basis. This will be augmented with appropriate records and procedures to track commitments&#13;
and to safeguard assets. The accounting records will be maintained in dual currencies on a&#13;
computerized system. The books of accounts will include a cash book, ledgers, journal vouchers, a&#13;
fixed asset register, and a contracts register.    Annual financial statements will be prepared in&#13;
accordance with International Accounting Standards. All accounting and control procedures are&#13;
documented inthe financial management manual, and will be regularly updated by the PMIU.&#13;
111.    Financial monitoring reports. Quarterly financial monitoring reports produced by the&#13;
project will be reviewed by the Bank. Adequate accounting and financial management capacity (an&#13;
international financial management specialist and a national accountant already operational at the&#13;
PMIU) will enable the PMIU to establish effective financial management and accounting systems,&#13;
which should facilitate the production o f the financial monitoring report.&#13;
&#13;
112.    Internal audit. Consideringthe overall risk environment inAngola, there i s a needto put in&#13;
place a strong internal control mechanism and quality assurance system at all levels. This i s the&#13;
reason for the engagement o f a qualified internal auditor (a firm) with relevant experience with&#13;
donor-financed projects.     Selection o f the internal auditor has been finalized according to the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures. The internal audit reports are accessible to the&#13;
Bank's project supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
113.    External audits. The government external auditors recruited for EMRP 1 have been&#13;
engaged on a renewable contract, subject to satisfactory performance.        The contract o f these&#13;
auditors will be extended to include EMRP2 (this i s feasible from procurement perspective).&#13;
&#13;
114.    As presently done under EMRP 1, the external audit will cover all Bank and counterpart&#13;
funds with EMRP 2.          Consolidated audited project accounts will be produced, taking into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consideration the current audit policy guidelines o f the World Bank. The format to be adopted i s&#13;
documented in the financial management manual. Besides expressing a primary opinion on the&#13;
audited financial statements in compliance with international accounting standards, the audit report&#13;
will be submitted to IDAwithinsix months after the end o f each financial year. The auditor will be&#13;
required to prepare a separate management letter giving observations and comments, and providing&#13;
recommendations for improvements o f accounting records, systems, controls and compliance with&#13;
financial covenants in the Financing Agreement. If necessary during implementation, technical&#13;
audits could also be carriedout.&#13;
&#13;
115.    Financial covenants. The financial covenants for phase 1 have been complied with and&#13;
will be maintained for phase 2. The financial covenants are the standard ones as stated in Article&#13;
IV o fthe FinancingAgreement.&#13;
&#13;
G.      Supervision&#13;
&#13;
116.    Due to its status as a high-riskproject, the Bank will devote about three missions per year,&#13;
or an average o f 85 staff weeks per year intotal to supervise EMRP 1and 2. This is more than for&#13;
the ordinary projects, as recommended in the Bank's Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy.&#13;
Duringthe first year of EMRP2, supervision will focus onperformance o fthe executingentities in&#13;
managing contracts, procurement, and financial matters, as well as in completing the agreed&#13;
implementation plans.      Supervision will pay special attention to indicators o f corruption in&#13;
procurement that may signal that procurement involves bribes or kickbacks, bid collusion, or fraud.&#13;
During the following years, in addition to attention to procurement and financial management,&#13;
supervision will focus on progress in executing works, developing the sector strategies, and&#13;
strengthening capacity of government to implement future development projects, in addition to&#13;
reviewingregularly compliance with fiduciary, procurement and environmental safeguards.&#13;
&#13;
 H.     Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
117.    The project i s based on the results-based approach.      Key performance indicators are&#13;
specified inthe results framework inannex 1, buildingon experience inthe Democratic Republic o f&#13;
Congo with a similar multisector emergency reconstruction project.&#13;
&#13;
118.    Reviews. In addition to regular supervision by Bank staff, reviews to assess progress in&#13;
implementing the agreed activities will be carried out every six months by the Bank, together with&#13;
the government and the other involved parties.        This will be part o f the government donor&#13;
coordination process.      The interministerial steering committee through the PMIU will be&#13;
responsible for preparing the necessary documentation for the reviews and for planning the review&#13;
meetings. During the first reviews, special attention will be paid to assessing the distribution o f&#13;
donors' support to the PPMRRP, with a view to reorienting the IDA support ifnecessary to ensure&#13;
the equitable distribution o fresources overall.&#13;
&#13;
119.    A midterm review o f EMRP 1 is planned to be carried out by December 30, 2007.&#13;
Similarly, a comprehensive midterm review o f EMRP 2 will take place 24 months after its&#13;
effectiveness. The EMRP2 midterm review will assess implementation progress, coherence inthe&#13;
implementation o f both phases, achievement o f overall objectives, and the roles o f different&#13;
partners. Government will contract a consultant to review and assess progress in implementing the&#13;
program and to assist in preparing the necessary documentation for the midterm review. The&#13;
interministerial steering committee through the PMIU will be responsible for preparing&#13;
documentation for the review and for planning the midterm review meeting. The midterm review&#13;
will identify measures to improveperformance ifneeded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Coordinationofdonors&#13;
&#13;
120.     Several partners, includingthe UNsystem, the European Union, and FrenchDevelopment&#13;
Cooperation are providing parallel finance for the project. In addition, French Development&#13;
Cooperation is financing a highlevel advisor to assist the PMIU in implementing the project. All&#13;
partners supporting the project recognize the importance of coordinating their efforts to direct&#13;
assistance to priority needs in a timely manner, to prevent gaps or overlaps, to ensure sustainable&#13;
budget expenditure planning, and to reinforce their contribution to the policy dialogue. They have&#13;
agreed to coordinate assistance to the extent possible through regular meetings coordinated by the&#13;
Ministry of Planning. This coordinated approach is expected to improve effectiveness of the&#13;
project and to reduce the reputationalriskto the Bank of its engagement.&#13;
&#13;
J.       Environmentalaspects and compliancewiththe World Bank SafeguardPolicies&#13;
&#13;
121.     As the second phase of a project processed under Operation Policy (OP) 8.50, and&#13;
originally constrained by lower than expected IDA 13 finance, EMRP i s being processedunder OP&#13;
8.50. As such, it is not requiredto have project safeguard instruments approved and disclosed in-&#13;
country and at the InfoShop prior to appraisal. Like EMRP 1, EMRP 2 i s classified environmental&#13;
assessment category B. It will focus on rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing infrastructure&#13;
and on delivery of basic services. The appropriate actions that will be taken duringimplementation&#13;
with regard to compliance with national and Bank guidelines for environmental and social impact&#13;
assessment and mitigation are presentedinthe appendixes to the project technical annex.&#13;
&#13;
122.     Due to the multisector nature of EMRP 2, and because the environmental and social impact&#13;
characteristics of the project activities are not known in sufficient detail at this time, a&#13;
programmatic or strategic approach for environmental and social assessment (including screening&#13;
and categorization, preparation, public consultation, disclosure, review, approval and monitoring)&#13;
will be put inplace and implemented over the life o f both EMRP 1and 2. A resettlement policy&#13;
framework, to be reviewed and approved by IDA, will be prepared (prior to the start o f the major&#13;
works under EMRP 2), addressing the policy, principles, institutional arrangements and procedures&#13;
that the government will follow in each subproject involving resettlement or loss o f economic&#13;
activities, and disclosed separately.     Landmine issues will be addressed according to the&#13;
government landmines strategy, which i s supported by UNDP and other donors.                      Given&#13;
uncertainties regarding the location of some o f the activities and the complexity o f Angola's&#13;
environmental and social situation, this approach i s designed to ensure that the site selection, design&#13;
and implementation of all activities comply with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
&#13;
123.     All individual environmental and social impact assessments, environmental management&#13;
plans, pest management plans, and resettlement action plans for the various activities of EMRP 1&#13;
and 2 were expected to be completed within one year following effectiveness of EMRP 1.&#13;
However, given uncertainties regarding activities to be supported under EMRP 2, the&#13;
environmental and social impact assessments have been delayed. The request for proposals for&#13;
these services has been sent to the short-listed firms, and proposals have been received. The&#13;
selection of the firmwill be finalized as quickly as possible followingBoard approval of EMRP2.&#13;
&#13;
124.     An environmental consulting firm will be engaged for an initial period of three years to&#13;
manage and oversee the environmental and social aspects o f overall EMRP (1 and 2). The vast&#13;
majority o f environmental and social issues will arise in the context o f EMRP 2, as EMRP 1 has&#13;
focused on improving delivery of education, health, and agriculture services, and on preparations&#13;
for the infrastructure investments to be implemented under EMRP 2. The firm will also provide&#13;
institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services to the various ministries and national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
entities involved. The firm will help to build the capacity of the Secretary of Environment Estate,&#13;
o f the line ministries, and of the other entities participating inthe project to manage environmental&#13;
issues relating to project activities. The firm will also work with the government to screen all&#13;
infrastructure investments o f both phases o f EMRP for environmental and social impacts and&#13;
ensure that measures are identifiedto prevent or mitigate potential adverse affects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PART5: BENEFITSAND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
A.        Benefits&#13;
&#13;
125.      The EMRP operations will provide several important benefits. EMRP 1will help prevent&#13;
the further deterioration of health and loss of life of people who are living in extreme poverty by&#13;
contributing to food security and delivery of health care and other basic services, including&#13;
restoring water supply in the provincial capitals. EMRP 2 will help restore electricity supply in&#13;
provincial capitals and improve public health conditions inurban and rural areas. It will help revive&#13;
the economy by bringingdown the costs o f transportation, which will increase the competitiveness&#13;
o f goods. It will help to reintegrate the country by reestablishing transportation links between the&#13;
country's provinces.      It will help to reduce poverty among both agricultural producers and&#13;
consumers by stimulating agricultural production and reducing costs and time o f transporting food&#13;
from producers to markets. Over the medium and longer term, through capacity building, the&#13;
program will benefit the Angolan people by helping to create an improved legal and regulatory&#13;
framework and more stable and effective institutions-critical conditions for better governance.&#13;
Finally, it will help lay the groundwork for future policy and institutional reforms and a future&#13;
investment programfor the country's development.&#13;
&#13;
B.        Risks&#13;
&#13;
126.      When EMRP 1was submitted to the Board on February 17,2005, its size and complexity,&#13;
coupled with the macroeconomic constraints of Angola, made the development, safeguard,&#13;
financial, and fiduciary risks high. Duringpreparation of EMRP 1, the Bank worked closely with&#13;
government and development partners to ensure the risks were identified and mitigation measures&#13;
planned. The riskmitigation system that was agreedincludeda fully staffed and operational PMIU,&#13;
technical assistance financed by other partners, ring-fencing of procurement and financial&#13;
management, and a comprehensive financial management system, including internal and external&#13;
audits. The establishment o f the risk mitigation system was fully supported by government, and i s&#13;
operational (the first FMR and the first reports of the internal and external auditors have been&#13;
produced, all of which have been found satisfactory).               The financial and administrative&#13;
management systemwhich has been established and working for EMRP 1will be extended to cover&#13;
EMRP2.&#13;
&#13;
127.      Despite the country risk still being high, the risk mitigation measures described above&#13;
provide a reasonable safeguard for effective implementation of EMRP 2. Recent EMRP 1 review&#13;
missions by procurement and financial management specialists noted that the risk mitigation&#13;
measures are being satisfactorily implemented and the procurement risk for the project has been&#13;
upgraded to average instead of high.&#13;
&#13;
128.      Major risks and mitigation measures are presented intable 13:&#13;

            Angola - Second Emergency Multi-Sector
            Recovery Program Project

        <abstracts>
            The Angola Second Emergency Multi-Sector
            Recovery Program (EMRP) seeks to initiate the long-term
            process of reconstruction and economic rehabilitation. The
            program which is implemented in two phases (Phase 1 and
            Phase 2), comprises four components: (a) rural development
            and delivery of social services; (b) rehabilitation and
            reconstruction of critical infrastructure (roads and
            bridges, electricity, water supply, and urban
            infrastructure); (c) capacity building, institutional
            strengthening and development of sector strategies; and (d)
            management and monitoring of the project and preparation of
            the next steps. The program prevents the further
            deterioration of health and loss o f life of people by
            increasing food security, delivering health care and other
            basic services, restoring water and electricity supplies,
            and improving public health conditions in cities. It also
            helps lay the groundwork for future policy and institutional
            reforms and a future investment program for the
            country's development.
