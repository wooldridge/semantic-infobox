&#13;
The Macroeconomic Management and Policy Division of EDI (EDIMP) conducted a core course on New&#13;
Issues in Economic Growth in Washington, D.C. from June 8-12, 1998. The five-day course was aimed at&#13;
strengthening participants' analytical and research skills in the field of economic growth. The course was&#13;
designed to provide both a theoretical framework and empirical studies of the determinants of economic&#13;
growth, as well as the understanding of policy issues for achieving equitable and sustainable growth. Fifty-&#13;
one participants attended this course, consisting of selected participants from partner institutions in&#13;
developing countries and World Bank economists.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-course questionnaire. The&#13;
questionnaire was completed by thirty-eight respondents, 74.5 percent of the total number of participants.&#13;
There were two sections in the questionnaire. The first section asked respondents to rate the extent to&#13;
which the course met performance objectives. The second section asked the level of respondents&#13;
knowledge about topics covered in the course, before and after completing the course, based on self-&#13;
assessment. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to 5 = maximum was used to rate&#13;
respondents rating for each question in each section. Following are some of the major evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ·   All course performance ratings, including course content, organization and delivery, exceeded 3.0&#13;
        on a 5-point scale. Respondents' ratings were particularly high on the indicators measuring the&#13;
        adequacy of administrative assistance and the extent to which the course was a worthwhile&#13;
        experience. The mean scores on these two indicators were both 4.35 out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Of all indicators on the relevancy of the course, respondents indicated that the course was most&#13;
        relevant in meeting their personal learning needs. The mean score was 4.11 out of 5.0. This result&#13;
        seems to reflect the richness of the course presenters. Sixteen speakers from the World Bank and&#13;
        universities were invited to discuss various subjects of the course. Respondents felt that the&#13;
        presentations were very constructive, giving them a mean score of 4.16.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Results indicated respondents' high approval ratings of course trainers. Ninety-five percent of&#13;
        respondents felt strongly that the trainers encouraged participants to engage in the discussions,&#13;
        rating 4 or 5 on this indicator. Ninety-two percent also indicated that the trainers were successful in&#13;
        communicating their messages well. The two mean scores for trainers were 4.38 and 4.17,&#13;
        respectively, out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Indicators measuring the extent to which the course helped participants better assess various&#13;
        policy alternatives had relatively lower ratings, around the mid-3.0 in mean scores. One question&#13;
        asked respondents whether the course provided policy alternatives that were not previously&#13;
        considered. Respondents' rating on this indicator was 3.43 out of 5.0, the lowest mean score&#13;
        among all course performance indicators. This suggests that respondents were generally familiar&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  with the policies presented in the course before entering the course.&#13;
&#13;
· Respondents' pre/post self-assessment of their knowledge indicated positive increases in the level&#13;
  of their understanding of all key issues presented in the course. Pre-course mean scores of all&#13;
  respondents were in the 2.6-3.2 range. Respondents ratings of their knowledge after the course&#13;
  rose to the 3.2-4.1 range.&#13;
&#13;
· Respondents from the World Bank (N=13) indicated that they had a fair knowledge of issues such&#13;
  as problems in alternative development strategies and incentives to promote growth-creating&#13;
  policies before the course. The pre-course mean scores on these two topics were 3.69 and 3.62&#13;
  out of 5.0. Results showed that they felt more confident about these issues after the course,&#13;
  increasing mean scores to 4.23 and 4.0, respectively. The Bank respondents' largest gain was on&#13;
  the topic of empirical evidence on incentives, convergence and growth. The pre-course rating of&#13;
  3.15 rose to 4.15 after the course.&#13;
&#13;
· Non-Bank respondents (N=18) had relatively low pre-course knowledge ratings on all course&#13;
  topics. Pre-course mean scores ranged from the mid- to high 2.0 out of 5.0. They indicated that&#13;
  they had better understanding of all issues after the course. Knowledge gains were particularly&#13;
  large for this group on issues such as the problems in alternative development strategies and the&#13;
  relationship between growth, inequality and poverty. Mean scores on these two issues increased&#13;
  from 2.76 to 3.72, and from 2.59 to 3.83, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
· Pre/post knowledge assessment serves as an indicator of how much respondents felt they knew&#13;
  about a topic upon entering the course and how much they felt they learned at the end of the&#13;
  course. It should be noted that the results do not measure how much they actually learned. The&#13;
  present assessment consisted of questions about respondents' knowledge of key conceptual&#13;
  issues. In future courses, it may be useful to include indicators measuring changes in participants'&#13;
  analytical and research skills before and after the course. Obtaining data on participants who have&#13;
  taken optional technical lab classes also may be useful for this purpose.&#13;
