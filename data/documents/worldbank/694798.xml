I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          In the short span of fifteen years, policy analysis has become a mainstay of modern&#13;
economic management. As distinct from policy research, which is more academic and less time-bound,&#13;
policy analysis is tied to a specific decision point in government. Policy analysts, who are generally&#13;
trained in economics and statistics, consider both the consequences of alternative public policy choices&#13;
and the likelihood of their implementation. Public agencies in industrialized economies rely heavily on&#13;
policy analysts and when the desired skill base is lacking in government they turn to consultants for&#13;
specialized advice. In some cases, consulting firms or institutes fill government needs when civil service&#13;
or other prohibitions prevent the analysts from being hired directly.!'&#13;
1.2          Capacity for economic policy analysis has been steadily improving in Russia since 1992,&#13;
but is still very weak both in and outside government. Capacity constraints are becoming acute as the&#13;
reform agenda grows more complex. The Government of Russia (GOR) succeeded in reducing consumer&#13;
price inflation by reducing the fiscal deficit. The stabilization effort is being supported by a three-year&#13;
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement agreed with the IMF in March 1996. With the most evident&#13;
deficit reduction measures already taken, Russia needs to deepen structural reforms to sustain&#13;
macroeconomic stability and lay the basis for sustained growth.&#13;
1.3          The Bank has worked closely with the IMF and the Government to develop a&#13;
comprehensive agenda of structural reforms in areas such as privatization and enterprise restructuring,&#13;
financial sector reform, fiscal management, and the social safety net. Further work is required in each&#13;
area to translate this agenda into a detailed and monitorable package of policy actions. This will entail&#13;
intensive economic policy analysis to assess options that maximize allocative efficiency and promote&#13;
welfare.&#13;
1.4          However, elaboration of structural reform programs, and economic management more&#13;
generally, are complicated by the shortage of qualified economists in Government and by an institutional&#13;
setting for economic policy advice that is fragmented and in flux. The Government recognized the&#13;
limitations of employing ad hoc working groups during development of the EFF and requested Bank&#13;
support to build more sustained institutional capacity in public agencies for high-quality economic policy&#13;
analysis.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.5           The project concept was developed during a day-long brainstorming session in Moscow&#13;
in February 1996 attended by representatives of the core economic ministries, leading Russian economic&#13;
policy institutes, the Bank, and the EBRD. Based on an institutional analysis of the supply and demand&#13;
for economic policy advice2', and on a study of lessons of international experienceT', the group agreed&#13;
that there was a significant shortage of economic policy analysts in Russia compared to like-sized&#13;
economies that was undermining the development and implementation of structural reforms. They agreed&#13;
that establishment of a new governmental bureau for this purpose should be explored. Thereafter, a Bank&#13;
mission visited Moscow in early April to assess stakeholder views on such a body, and agreed with&#13;
Governmental representatives on the outlines of a charter and governance structure. The mission found&#13;
broad stakeholder support for the project, including from the Ministers of Finance and Economy.&#13;
1.6           On July 2, 1996, a founding body met to adopt the Charter and nominate the Board of&#13;
Trustees and Board of Directors of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. All of the leading economic&#13;
agencies of Government are represented in the governance structure, as well as eminent economists in&#13;
the Presidential Administration, Central Bank of Russia and Duma. After the presidential elections in&#13;
June 1996, minor changes to the Charter were discussed with the Bank and adopted by the Board of&#13;
Directors in December 1996. The BEA is registered with the Ministry of Justice as an independent not-&#13;
for-profit foundation.&#13;
1.7           The proposed Bureau of Economic Analysis Project (BEAP) recommends IBRD financing&#13;
of US$22.6 million to support the project for the following reasons, each of which is developed in&#13;
subsequent chapters:&#13;
*      it would address a critical skills and institutional gap in the supply and demand for&#13;
economic policy advice (chapter 2);&#13;
*      it incorporates the lessons of experience and would support the Bank's country strategy&#13;
(chapter 3);&#13;
*      it would finance high-priority economic policy studies in support of the transition to a&#13;
market economy and finance training and technical assistance to increase Govermnent&#13;
capacity to prepare the national accounts and high quality economic analyses (chapter 4);&#13;
*      it would create the BEA outside of Government but accountable to it, to provide an&#13;
objective, economy-wide perspective in assessing policy options, to carry out an agreed&#13;
work program of policy studies at Government request (chapter 5);&#13;

*      it would establish mechanisms for payment by ministries using the BEA as a market test&#13;
for its services, while avoiding contracts from private sources, to reduce conflicts of&#13;
interest (chapter 6); and&#13;
*      it would confer significant benefits in developing economic policy and the structural&#13;
reform agenda. Steps have been taken to minimize the risks under various scenarios&#13;
(chapter 7).&#13;

RUSSIAN BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PROJECT&#13;
II. THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING&#13;
2.1     Economic management and structural reform are complicated in Russia by an institutional setting&#13;
for economic policy advice that is fragmented and in flux. As views on the state's role in the economy&#13;
change, the market for economic advice is realigning both in terms of supply (economic research&#13;
institutes) and demand (from the President, Government, Duma, and the business community).&#13;
A. Supply and Demand for Economic Advice&#13;
2.2          As of 1991, there were 61 economic research institutes in Moscow specializing in&#13;
theoretical and applied economic research. Most (54) were attached to ministries and state committees,&#13;
including GOSPLAN, while the remainder were part of what became the Russian Academy of Sciences.&#13;
They were funded almost entirely from the budget. Although overstaffed and ideologically oriented, the&#13;
system after 1985 was sufficiently permissive to allow individual economists to be exposed to market-&#13;
economy principles. The first wave of reformers and business elites emanated from this community.&#13;
2.3          By 1994, prompted by enthusiasm for market principles, the number of organizations&#13;
carrying out economic research grew by 30 percent. They sought to fill the demand by business interests&#13;
and Government for analysis of current economic trends. The older institutes, which retained a mentality&#13;
more suited to the central allocative mechanism of the Soviet state and its branch and functional&#13;
ministries, were neither oriented nor positioned to meet the more short-term needs of the emerging&#13;
market. Their best researchers left, some to the new independent institutes, whose principal clients are&#13;
outside Government. Funding channels remained largely unchanged (directed by ministries to affiliated&#13;
institutes), but budget support declined on average by 40-60 percent while overheads (social security and&#13;
utilities) escalated. The financial squeeze forced the institutes to seek income from sources other than&#13;
their traditional public-sector clients. Nevertheless, salaries in scientific and economic research were,&#13;
by 1993, 35 percent lower than the economy-wide average.&#13;
2.4          Meanwhile, given the turbulent political background, the focus of strategic economic&#13;
decisions and their implementation has been shifting. There is increased demand for economic analysis&#13;
from the Duma, but it generally parallels the political outlook of the faction requesting advice.&#13;
Governmental ministries, not fully aware of their role in a transition economy, continue to request&#13;
traditional but short-lived programming documents from affiliated institutes.&#13;
2.5          The resulting reduction and consolidation of economic research institutes has been uneven,&#13;
such that weaker institutes may enjoy partial funding while some stronger institutes are at risk. The still&#13;
developing situation is not yet market-driven in that the present structure reflects neither the comparative&#13;
advantage nor the quality of the institutes. Increased funding from private sources for these institutes is&#13;
-4 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not a solution for government, given the potential conflict of interest in many sensitive areas of economic&#13;
policy.&#13;
B. Institutional Framework&#13;
2.6          In addition to the imperfect supply and demand structure, three institutional issues are&#13;
inhibiting the flow of economic advice in support of macroeconomic and structural reforms:&#13;
Lack of Analytical Objectivity. The market is "feudalized" into domains dominated by&#13;
a particular individual, group of interests, or government institution. In the unstable&#13;
climate, institute tasks and functions are often hostage to political or vested interests.&#13;
*     Disconnectionfrom Policy Process. With few exceptions, institutes do not enjoy access&#13;
to current information or to senior decision-makers (Deputy Prime Minister level and&#13;
above). Most are independent or report to ministries or state departments that technically&#13;
fall outside of Government. Research funded from external sources is at particular risk&#13;
of having little influence on the decision-making process.&#13;
Incoherent Policy Advice. The fragmentation of advice along narrow issues, provided to&#13;
multiple government users, has prevented the emergence of more coherent&#13;
macroeconomic or "general equilibrium" framework for decision-making.&#13;
2.7          As noted in the next section, these difficulties were temporarily overcome from 1992-95&#13;
through an ad hoc arrangement that developed outside existing institutional channels.&#13;
2.8          Economic Policy Advice in Support of the Reform Program, 1992-96. During 1992-96,&#13;
the economic reform program was developed and managed by a handful of reformist Government&#13;
officials. Most were located in the core economic ministries (Finance and Economy) under the First&#13;
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs or in GKI (State Property Agency). Their ability to drive&#13;
the policy agenda, however, was unrelated to their institutional affiliations. More important was their&#13;
participation, in 1992-94, in the Working Center for Economic Reform, or after 1994, on the Economic&#13;
Reform Commission under the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy. While ostensibly part of&#13;
Government, both bodies functioned more as in-house consulting firms to senior policy-makers. These&#13;
two groups, whose members overlapped, were the central nervous system of the reform program. They&#13;
developed and coordinated the macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform agenda underlying the&#13;
Bank's two Rehabilitation Loans, SAL I, and the Fund's Stand-by Arrangement and EFF.&#13;
2.9          The analytical needs of the reformist officials were met in the early stages primarily by&#13;
two Government institutions: the Center of Economic Forecasting and Analysis and the Center of&#13;
Information and Social Technologies. These had important advantages over other existing institutes&#13;
because they were granted access to current information and exposure to the policy process. Systematic&#13;
linkages between the core economic policy team and the older institutes atrophied.&#13;
- 5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.10          At the same time, efforts to increase capacity in the core economic ministries was initially&#13;
constrained by the shortage of qualified economists and low civil service payscales. As new graduates&#13;
with high-quality training began appearing in 1994, and external financing for international and Russian&#13;
economic expertise became available, the problem was temporarily eased. In the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
the matching of international expertise with recent graduates dramatically increased the Ministry's&#13;
capacity for macroeconomic modelling and analysis, which has been a critical component in the success&#13;
of stabilization efforts.4'&#13;
2.11          Recently, however, the cream of the younger talent pool has begun to leave the core&#13;
ministries for better remuneration in the private sector, and reliance on international experts, never an&#13;
ideal solution, cannot be maintained indefinitely. Due to financial constraints, the Center of Economic&#13;
Forecasting and Analysis has nearly ceased operations while the Center of Information and Social&#13;
Technologies has closed. All of the remaining institutions in research and policy analysis have been&#13;
weakened by under-funding and competition from the private sector. Capacity is insufficient to handle&#13;
the quantity of cross-sectoral analysis required for second-stage transition issues.&#13;
2.12          In summary, a critical demand has appearedfor objective and coherent economic policy&#13;
advice to inform strategic economic decisions during the next stage of the transition. This demand cannot&#13;
be met by the skill base presently available in existing institutes and ministries. Nor would the&#13;
strengthening of a single existing governmental structure provide a sustainable solution given civil service&#13;
restrictions that affect all publicly-supported ministries and institutes.&#13;
C. Plans and Programs&#13;
The Government&#13;
2.13          The Government's medium-term economic strategy includes actions to: (i) continue a&#13;
restrained macroeconomic policy stance as a precondition for sustained growth; (ii) strengthen Russia's&#13;
capacity to implement macroeconomic policy through the introduction of requisite instruments and&#13;
institutions; and (iii) advance structural reforms that can consolidate stabilization and enhance prospects&#13;
for sustained growth.&#13;
2.14          As part of its capacity-building strategy, the Government requested Bank financing to&#13;
support the establishment of the BEA. The initial request for financing, proposed in October 1995 by&#13;
the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy, was confirmed in a letter to the President of the World&#13;
Bank by the Minister of Economy in April 1996 and again to the President by the First Deputy Prime&#13;
Minister for Economy in Moscow in April 1997. In the absence of the project, a structural reform&#13;
agenda as ambitious as that agreed with the IMF will-be difficult to implement. Independent of the EFF,&#13;
however, the demand for sound economic policy advice will outpace existing institutional capacity as&#13;
more complex second-stage transition issues supersede the stabilization-oriented agenda of the past several&#13;
4/     Financing for the Ministry of Finance's macroeconomic unit has come from the EU, US Treasury, and World&#13;
Bank.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
years. The BEAP responds to the high priority placed by government on grounding the next phase of&#13;
reforms in objective economic analysis&#13;
External Donor Assistance&#13;
2.15         Most donors have targeted elements of the reform  agenda for support, such as&#13;
privatization or agriculture. Few have focussed on strengthening capacity for cross-sectoral policy&#13;
analysis. The IMF, EU, USAID, Bank and other organizations have made important contributions in&#13;
building skills related to public finance and fiscal policy, including in the Ministry of Finance and Central&#13;
Bank. The EU is also supporting the Russian - European Centre for Economic Policy, which is a&#13;
collaborative organization. But the needs in government for analytic capacity far outweigh the aid&#13;
provided to date.&#13;
2.16         There are several organizations which could be counterparts to the BEA, for which&#13;
twinning arrangements would be very useful. These include the Economic Development Institute of the&#13;
Bank, the OECD, and bilateral agencies with similar functions, such as the U.S. Council of Economic&#13;
Advisors or the Korean Development Institute, and statistical agencies, such as EUROSTAT and Statistics&#13;
Canada. Such contacts were initiated during project preparation and will be developed further by the&#13;
Scientific Secretary of the BEA, who will coordinate external donor support as part of the External&#13;
Outreach Program (see Appendix 13).&#13;
2.17         In addition, the Bank and BEA are in touch with several interested donor agencies to&#13;
support the proposed project by providing experts in areas under analysis by the BEA, by offering&#13;
fellowships for advanced study of macroeconomics and policy analysis, and by financing study tours to&#13;
provide comparative international experience in a given policy area. Commitment in principle to provide&#13;
grant support has been secured from several agencies.&#13;

III. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.1           The Russia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is scheduled to be discussed by the Board&#13;
in June 1997. The proposed Bureau of Economic Analysis Project (BEAP) is fully consistent with the&#13;
objectives of the CAS and with operational standards for project quality:&#13;
*      Responds to the government's request for assistance in grounding reforms in high-quality,&#13;
objective economic analysis;&#13;
*      Builds institutional capacity for fiscal and economic management, which is a key&#13;
structural reform priority;&#13;
i      Supports fiscal consolidation by financing the core analytic work required to develop the&#13;
Government's tax reform strategy;&#13;
*      Helps accelerate the structural reform program by strengthening capacity in government&#13;
to assess reform options in key areas such as privatization and enterprise restructuring;&#13;
private and financial sector development; social safety net and agriculture;&#13;

e      Incorporates lessons of experience for institutional development projects, as outlined&#13;
below, including through increased attention to borrower commitment, governance&#13;
structure, and organizational management.&#13;
B. Lessons of Experience&#13;
3.2    Lessons of Experience from  Institutional Development2' TALs.  Technical assistance loans&#13;
(TALs) are traditionally among the weakest performers in the Bank portfolio. The rating for TALs in&#13;
the 1996 Annual Review of Portfolio Performance (ARPP) was particularly poor.6' While the causes of&#13;
poorly performing Bank TALs are a source of continuing debate, OED findings suggest that governance&#13;
problems and weak management have been two main reasons for poor past performance of TALs. A&#13;
special study commissioned in response to the 1996 ARPP confirmed an additional finding: that borrower&#13;
5/     The Bank distinguishes between substitution TA, where consultants and advisors fill short-term gaps in local&#13;
capacity, and institutional development TA (IDTA), which aims to build capacity by strengthening local skills and&#13;
institutions.&#13;
6/     Only 3 projects were rated satisfactory of 16 projects evaluated. Annual Review of Portfolio Performance 1995,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
commitment to the project's intent, design and strategy is the critical, but not sole, determinant of good&#13;
performance. -&#13;
3.3     The fluid institutional and political environment in Russia makes it particularly important to&#13;
ensure strong ownership of project objectives by a broad spectrum of government and institutional actors.&#13;
This project had its origin in a special brain-storming session during project identification that included&#13;
representatives of core economic ministries (the demand side of economic advice) and key economic&#13;
research institutes (the supply side). Two studies were commissioned for the meeting: one on the&#13;
institutional setting for economic advice in Russia, and the other on experience internationally of&#13;
economic policy advice to governments.0' After a full day of discussion, the session recommuended the&#13;
establishment of a new institution combining design features of various successful institutes. Following&#13;
this, a survey of prominent stakeholders (including the Ministers of Finance and Economy) was&#13;
undertaken to ensure broad consensus for project objectives and the organizational design.&#13;
3.4     The Bank has been involved in promoting research networks and economic policy institutes in&#13;
a number of countries. It supported the Korea Development Institute, the Thai Development and&#13;
Research Institute, and economic research networks in the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.&#13;
However, these predominantly involved grant resources coordinated from a number of donors rather than&#13;
loan financing, as in the proposed project. Nevertheless, a relevant lesson of experience is the need to&#13;
ensure demand for a new institute's services. This has been discussed with stakeholders, who agree that&#13;
payment by ministries for policy analysis is a desirable proxy for a market test.&#13;
3.5     Lessonsfrom  Bank TALs in Russia. The Bank's experience with TALs in Russia underscores&#13;
the importance of these lessons of experience. Earlier projects in Russia9' demonstrated the importance&#13;
of strong Borrower commitment to the project objectives, design and strategy, as noted above, as well&#13;
as to design issues affecting institutional performance. In this regard, governance structure and strong&#13;
project management have proven to be of critical importance.L°' A significant amount of time during&#13;
preparation of the proposed project was devoted to designing an appropriate governance structure that&#13;
would suit the legal and institutional environment in Russia as well as the project objectives. In addition,&#13;
the organizational structure combines the need for strong project management with the Russian tradition&#13;

the last fifty years. Although these institutes or councils differ greatly from one country to the next in&#13;
terms of their size, modus operandi, and institutional arrangements, some key factors distinguish effective&#13;
institutes. The central factor determining success is that the research and policy advice of the institute&#13;
is viewed as a national priority. This and other factors, which have been noted in designing the project,&#13;
include:&#13;
*      association with a powerful government agency while remaining outside the formal&#13;
bureaucracy;&#13;
*      direct access to/influence on key policymakers;&#13;
*      secure sources of financing;&#13;
*      staff composed of a small but elite group of top academics in the economics field;&#13;
*      attractive and competitive salaries to retain top academics; and&#13;
*      a clear mandate to conduct economic research and formulate policy in the best interests&#13;
of the national economy as a whole.&#13;

THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
RUSSIAN BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PROJECT&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
4.1   Due to shortcomings in the institutional framework, the Government has very limited capacity&#13;
to produce cross-sectoral analyses grounded in modern, market-based economics. This has constrained&#13;
the development and implementation of structural and market-oriented reforms. The proposed project&#13;
will address the principal institutional shortcomings and demonstrate the value of objective economic&#13;
policy advice as an essential component of national economic policymaking.&#13;
4.2   The principal development objective of the project is to build institutional capacity for sound&#13;
economic analysis in support of market-oriented and structural reforms. To meet this objective, the&#13;
project has three sub-goals:&#13;
a.    to increase the quantity and quality of cross-sectoral economic policy studies for use by&#13;
Government;&#13;
b.    to establish the BEA outside of Government but accountable to it, to provide an objective,&#13;
economy-wide perspective in assessing economic policy options; and&#13;
c.    to improve the reliability of the national accounts as the basis for sound economic&#13;
analysis.&#13;
4.3    The performance indicators (Appendix 1) were agreed at negotiations. They are designed to&#13;
monitor both the project outputs and impacts in terms of their utility, quality, and efficiency of&#13;
production. Project outputs will provide for sounder economic analysis based on more reliable National&#13;
Accounts and economic data and the integration of macroeconomic and welfare considerations into&#13;
sectoral and economic reform options. The principal project impact is expected to be the preparation of&#13;
detailed action plans in support of the Government's medium-term economic reform agenda. Based on&#13;
project outcomes, the Government is expected to positively assess the value of retaining this institutional&#13;
model.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
4.4   The project will finance three components:&#13;
a.    Policy Studies (US$11.0 million). This component would finance four products: (i) an&#13;
annual report on the state of the economy; (ii) quarterly indicators of economic&#13;
performance; (iii) medium-term policy studies on cross-sectoral topics in support of the&#13;
structural reform agenda; and (iv) quick-response notes in response to developments in&#13;
the policy environment. The BEA would manage the budget for delivery of these&#13;
products, which could generally be produced in cooperation with economic agencies&#13;
and/or institutes.&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
b.     Establishing the Bureau of Economic Analysis (US$17.5 million). Included in the BEA&#13;
component are several categories of investment and incremental recurrent costs needed&#13;
to establish the BEA, build capacity in policy analysis, and develop technical and&#13;
institutional linkages to domestic and international institutes.&#13;
c.    Improvement of National Accounts (US$6.8 million). The component would finance&#13;
computers, training, and technical assistance to help Goskomstat, the national statistical&#13;
agency, accelerate its present efforts to develop an integrated framework of national&#13;
accounts useful for economic and financial analysis and policy decisions.&#13;
4.5    Policy Studies (US$11.0 million).  Development and implementation of the Government's&#13;
structural reform agenda will require in-depth analyses from an economy-wide perspective, taking into&#13;
account the inter-relationships among industries, taxpayers and consumers. To this end, the BEA would&#13;
manage the budget for production of a number of outputs, some of which may be produced in&#13;
collaboration with other agencies or institutes, but with the BEA maintaining quality control. The most&#13;
important output would be medium-term policy studies in several areas (see Appendix 11), including&#13;
macroeconomic analysis and growth strategies, financial markets, enterprise economics and social policy.&#13;
Financing would be provided for local consultants, data requirements such as surveys, and if necessary,&#13;
international experts to assist in the completion of each study, which is expected to take approximately&#13;
three to six months. These studies will be focused on high-priority themes (for example, taxation or&#13;
pension reform) that are expected to lay the basis for significant policy decisions that are likely to impact&#13;
savings and investments and fiscal revenues and expenditures. These studies would be the BEA's core&#13;
product, consuming approximately 50 percent of its time. The themes chosen for the studies would&#13;
provide the central chapters of the annual report on the state of the economy, which would also discuss&#13;
economic trends and conditions based on the quarterly economic indicators produced by the BEA.&#13;
Production of the annual report and quarterly indicators are expected to consume another 25 percent of&#13;
the BEA's time.  The BEA will also need flexibility to respond to requests from senior officials on&#13;
developments in the policy environment. For this purpose, approximately 25 percent of the BEA's time&#13;
is expected to be spent producing quick-response policy notes.&#13;
4.6    Bureau of Economic Analysis (US$17.5 million). The justification for establishing the BEA,&#13;
its governance structure, and operational procedures are discussed in Chapter 5. This component would&#13;
finance the technical and human resource base needed to increase capacity for economic policy analysis&#13;
both in the BEA and in the core economic ministries. These expenditures would include: (i) computer&#13;
and information technology needed for the BEA's statistical analysis and for linkages with Goskomstat,&#13;
the core economic ministries, and Russian and international academic institutes. Included in this activity&#13;
would be development of a library and on-line databases to facilitate the research needs of its staff and&#13;
consultants; (ii) training, study tours and fellowships both for BEA staff and for government staff&#13;
participating in policy studies, to develop analytic skills based on modern, market-based economics in&#13;
core economic agencies; and (iii) office furnishings to establish the BEA's premises. The incremental&#13;
recurrent costs, to be financed on a declining basis, would include managerial and support staff salaries,&#13;
internal communications (meetings of the Boards of Trustees and Directors and Academic Council), and&#13;
publications.&#13;
4.7    The BEA component would also include the budget of the External Outreach Program (Appendix&#13;
13), which will produce and distribute the annual report and quarterly economic indicators and promote&#13;
exchanges between the BEA and academic institutes, both in Russia and abroad, by means of conferences,&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
seminars, and twinning arrangements. The purpose of the External Outreach Program will be to further&#13;
cooperation within Russia and internationally on economic policy issues in the BEA's work program.&#13;
4.8    Cooperation with the Economic Development Institute (EDI) of the World Bank. Given its&#13;
experience internationally and in the region, EDI is well-positioned to provide BEA with assistance in&#13;
many areas, and in particular, training on economic policy analysis with a sectoral focus and technical&#13;
assistance on consensus-building and dissemination of analytical work. A formal arrangement is under&#13;
discussion whereby EDI will assist BEA in identifying training needs in policy analysis, and by&#13;
developing the first two training seminars for BEA staff and consultants and selected ministry staff. In&#13;
addition to offering technical assistance and training, BEA professional staff may compete for access to&#13;
EDI programs such as: (i) mid-level career training at the Joint Vienna Institute; (ii) a Scholarship&#13;
Program for study at any accredited university worldwide; and (iii) the Robert McNamara Fellowship for&#13;
post-graduate research. After the BEA has developed its policy study and external outreach programs,&#13;
EDI will consider establishing a formal partnership with the BEA, which would provide a stronger&#13;
network of training and institutional support.&#13;
4.9   Improvement of National Accounts (US$6.8 million). The main economic policy tools (fiscal,&#13;
monetary, and exchange rates) of a market economy cannot be applied on a sound basis to promote&#13;
growth with stability unless a good set of national accounts and data on other macroeconomic variables&#13;
are available. Goskomstat, the state statistical agency, has initiated several measures to adjust to the data&#13;
needs of a market economy and to compile GDP estimates through the production and expenditure&#13;
approaches based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). Despite notable progress both in&#13;
Goskomstat and by other data-collecting agencies, additional work is needed to accelerate the development&#13;
of an integrated framework of the national accounts. The component would make a significant&#13;
contribution to this objective by financing computer equipment, training and technical assistance needed&#13;
to improve the quality of economic statistics by improving data collection, upgrading the information&#13;
base, and by refining the methodology of computations.  The work program would follow the&#13;
recommendations in Russian Federation: Report on the National Accounts, produced in October 1995 by&#13;
a Joint Team including Russian agencies, led by Goskomstat, and international experts, led by the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
C. Project Management and Evaluation&#13;
4.10   Project Management. The Borrower shall make the proceeds of the Loan available to BEA and&#13;
Goskomstat on a grant basis. The Borrower agreed that the project would be managed in accordance&#13;
with an Agent Agreement between the Ministries of Finance and Economy, on one hand, and the BEA,&#13;
on the other. The Agent Agreement specifies the mechanism for payment of the local cost contribution&#13;
and taxes on the part of the Borrower. According to the Agent Agreement, which must be signed as&#13;
a condition of loan effectiveness, BEA is obligated to facilitate the strengthening of institutional&#13;
capacity in government agencies in the area of economic policy analysis and studies, and to support&#13;
the implementation of Part C of the Loan (Goskomstat component) through procurement and&#13;
disbursement services. The respective roles of BEA and Goskomstat in project implementation are&#13;
outlined in the Operations Manual. In summary, all substantive matters regarding the improvement of&#13;
the National Accounts would be managed by Goskomstat, and BEA would make available its expertise&#13;
in procurement and disbursement for this purpose to Goskomstat.&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.11   Monitoring and Evaluation. Evaluation will occur in the project at the following levels: (a)&#13;
project impact (overall impact in achieving development objectives); (b) BEA operations (the efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness of Bureau operations); and (c) impact of policy studies (relevance of objectives to&#13;
priority requirements). The plan for evaluating overall project impact is discussed in Appendix 1,&#13;
Performance and Monitoring Indicators and in Appendix 14, Evaluation Policy. The evaluation plan was&#13;
incorporated in the Operations Manual and the Project Agreement, both of which were approved by&#13;
the Board of Directors as a condition of Board Presentation.&#13;
4.12   BEA agreed to maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor the&#13;
achievement of objectives in line with project indicators. BEA agreed to furnish a report to the Bank&#13;
by June 30, 2000 that integrates the results of monitoring and evaluation activities. These shall be&#13;
discussed between the BEA and the Bank as part of the Mid-term Review, which would occur by&#13;
September 30, 2000.&#13;

THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
RUSSIAN BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PROJECT&#13;
V. THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Approach and Justification&#13;
5.1          The Government continues to develop and implement structural reform programs and&#13;
national economic policy with only minimal levels of analytic support grounded in the framework of&#13;
modern market-based economics. It has attempted to obtain the policy studies and analyses needed with&#13;
a variety of ad hoc arrangements relying on both Russian and foreign experts located in both&#13;
governmental units and non-governmental institutes. Experience has highlighted the shortcomings of this&#13;
approach:&#13;
*     Analysis and advice currently provided is fragmented, tends not to be cross-sectoral or&#13;
cross-ministerial, and varies widely in quality.&#13;
*     Current government procedures (civil service salaries, incentives for quality, etc.) are&#13;
insufficient to attract and retain staff with the required skills within the government and,&#13;
hence, to sustain needed analytic capacity.&#13;
a     Procuring services from private institutes or consulting firms is not a good substitute for&#13;
the government having its own capacity, given the need for confidentiality and lack of&#13;
scale economies stemming from distributing work among many groups.&#13;
*     Government experience with grant financed foreign experts has strengthened its belief&#13;
that it must have capacity funded by resources under its control.&#13;
5.2          The BEA is proposed to remedy these shortcomings. It will be a major source for the&#13;
government of policy reports, studies, and reports on economic issues, and it will report regularly to the&#13;
government on the state of the economy. Its status as a foundation outside the government would free&#13;
it from governmental procedures and constraints. The presence on the BEA's governing boards of&#13;
representatives from its clients-the major units of the federal government with principal responsibility&#13;
for economic policy-would assure the BEA's responsiveness and accountability to governmental needs.&#13;
5.3          The BEA is a non-commercial entity set up as a foundation under Russian law. It will&#13;
therefore not be restricted by governmental salary scales or personnel practices, and will be in a position&#13;
to offer levels of remuneration and support facilities that will allow it to compete effectively with the&#13;
private sector for the high quality staff required to produce the products needed by policy makers. An&#13;
Academic Board will help to ensure the quality of its staff and its output. The BEA's position outside&#13;
the government will ensure the independence and objectivity of its work and increase its ability to take&#13;
a cross-sectoral or cross-ministerial view of economic issues.&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Governance Structure&#13;
5.4          A summary of the governance structure of the BEA is shown in Appendices 6 and 7&#13;
(Charter and Internal Rules and Regulations). Following the requirements of the Law on Non-&#13;
Commercial Foundations, the BEA was established on July 2, 1996 by two non-governmental founders&#13;
who then formed a General Assembly comprised of founders (Academy of the National Economy and&#13;
the Higher School of Economics) and participants (the principal governmental economic agencies as well&#13;
as non-governmental representatives). The Assembly's principal responsibility is to approve the Charter&#13;
and appoint the Trustees and members of the Board of Directors.  Trustees and Directors are&#13;
representatives of the institutions or governmental units which comprise the Assembly. The Assembly&#13;
has no executive functions.&#13;
5.5          The Trustees advise on the overall strategic direction of the BEA, monitor its finances,&#13;
and promote its efficiency. Through its Chairman, the Trustees propose the candidate for the position&#13;
of BEA President to the General Assembly.  Trustees are ministerial level officials and eminent&#13;
individuals in the Presidential Administration, Duma and economics profession. The Chairman of the&#13;
Board of Trustees will be the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy. The Trustees are expected to&#13;
meet at least annually.&#13;
5.6          The Board of Directors provide the primary managerial oversight of the BEA. The Board&#13;
approves the annual work program of the BEA, appoints the Academic Council, approves large contracts&#13;
above US$ 250,000, reviews and approves the BEA's annual budget, and organization and staffing plan&#13;
and changes to the Operations Manual. The General Assembly elects the Chairman, who is normally&#13;
either the Minister of Finance or Economy, with one of the Deputy Chairmen (two are elected by the&#13;
Board) representing the alternate ministry. The Minister of Economy was appointed on July 2, 1996 to&#13;
be the first Chairman of the Board of Directors.l' Board members must attend Board meetings in person&#13;
with no substitutes and are chosen to represent their institutions or ministries. The Directors are expected&#13;
to meet at least quarterly.&#13;
5.7          The Academic Council will serve a quality control function. It has no managerial or&#13;
statutory responsibilities. It would assist in maintaining high quality standards by reviewing and advising&#13;
the Director General and Board of Directors on staff qualification requirements, the qualifications of&#13;
proposed staff, and the substantive outputs of the BEA's work program. It would also evaluate the&#13;
performance of the BEA  periodically.  Members--individuals (including non-Russians) with an&#13;
international standing in the economics profession--are appointed by the Board of Directors. The list has&#13;
been prepared by a task force headed by the Minister of Environment, who is also highly respected as&#13;
an economist, and members are in the process of being invited. At negotiations, the BEA confirmed that&#13;
the Academic Council had been constituted and that international experts would be invited to join the&#13;
Council before Loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.8          The management structure of the BEA includes a President and Director-General. The&#13;
President is a non-salaried official who provides strategic guidance on government priorities by means&#13;
of his nomination by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He would serve as a liaison between the&#13;
11/ During the Government reorganization in March 1997, the Minister of Economy became Minister (without portfolio)&#13;
for economic policy and Deputy Director of the Economic Reform Commission. He remains Chairman of the Board of&#13;
Directors.&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government and BEA. The Director-General, who is appointed by the Board of Directors, is the chief&#13;
executive officer who manages the day-to-day work of BEA. Both positions and their functions are&#13;
described in the Charter (Appendix 6).&#13;
C. Clients&#13;
5.9          With its main focus on national economic policy, the BEA's main client is the First&#13;
Deputy Prime Minister for Economy, who, as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, will be the ultimate&#13;
arbiter of priorities for the BEA's work program. The BEA will work primarily with the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, Ministry of Economy, Central Bank and others according to its mandate in formulating and&#13;
carrying out its work program, but will also interact with ministries and committees that become clients&#13;
of the BEA or that regulate sectors central to the BEA's work program. The principal governmental&#13;
clients for the BEA's policy studies, policy notes, research, and periodic reports on economic conditions&#13;
will initially be:&#13;
i.    The First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy&#13;
ii.    The Ministry of Economy&#13;
iii.    The Ministry of Finance&#13;
iv.    The Committee for State Property (GKI)&#13;
v.    The State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat)&#13;
vi.    The State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy&#13;
vii.   The Central Bank of Russia&#13;
5.10         As a major user of economic data, the BEA will need to interact extensively with&#13;
Goskomstat on data issues. As a data user, the BEA will be a client of Goskomstat. At the same time,&#13;
one of the BEA's activities will involve upgrading the quality of economic statistics and data needed for&#13;
economic policy work. Consequently, Goskomstat will also be a client of the BEA's for its upgrading&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
5.11         Some of the BEA's outputs will be intended for the public as client. Most notable of&#13;
these public reports will be the BEA's annual report on the state of the economy. This report will attempt&#13;
to assess overall economic conditions and trends, evaluate the objectives and performance of economic&#13;
policy, and present relevant economic data in an accessible format.&#13;
D. Organizational and Management Structure&#13;
5.12         Key sections of the Operations Manual outlining the organizational and staffing structure,&#13;
along with the functional organizational chart, are in Appendix 10.&#13;
5.13         Operating Principles. The BEA would be guided by several principles that are included&#13;
in the Operations Manual. These are objectivity and impartiality in its analytic work, cost-effectiveness&#13;
in its operations, coordination (to prevent duplication of effort), creativity, respect for confidentiality, and&#13;
high ethical standards and transparency. The duties and responsibilities of the BEA's executive&#13;
management as outlined in the Operations Manual are consistent with these principles, ensuring&#13;
uniformity, effectiveness, and transparency of operations. The Bank and BEA agreed on a draft&#13;
Operations Manual which was subsequently approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 1997 as&#13;
a condition of Board Presentation. The BEA agreed that any amendment of the Operations Manual&#13;
shall be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.14          Organizational Structure. The Executive Management of the BEA consists of the&#13;
following entities: (a) Executive Management, represented by the Director General; (b) Policy Analysis;&#13;
(c) Scientific Secretariat; and (d) Administrative and Accounting Departments. The Director General's&#13;
primary responsibilities are to ensure that the objectives of the project are attained in the most effective&#13;
manner; to successfully manage the BEA's financial, human and material resources; to represent the BEA&#13;
in dealing with other organizations; and to report to the governing authorities of the BEA in accordance&#13;
with its Charter. The Policy Analysis Department is the largest department and is responsible for the&#13;
BEA's outputs, primarily policy studies (discussed in Section E). It is headed by the Director-&#13;
Coordinator of Programs. The Scientific Secretariat, headed by the Scientific Secretary, cooperates&#13;
closely with the Policy Analysis Department. It is responsible for international contacts, seminars and&#13;
conferences, exchange programs and training, external donors and sponsorships, liaison and coordination&#13;
with Russian academic institutes, publishing and public relations. Finally, the Administrative and&#13;
Accounting Departments, also headed by managers, will be responsible for management of financial&#13;
resources and accounting, personnel, administrative and office support, and procurement. BEA agreed&#13;
that: (i) it shall, at all times, employ a Director General and a Deputy Director General, a Chief&#13;
Accountant and a Scientific Secretary, whose qualifications and experience shall be acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; and (iii) by December 1 of each year starting in 1998, the BEA shall prepare its organization&#13;
and staffing plan for the following year, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
5.15          Policy Analysis Department. This is the main operational output unit. As its scope of&#13;
work is highly variable and unpredictable, the Department will be organized on a matrix basis, with most&#13;
of the substantive work sub-contracted to consultants or organizations. Five group managers, with&#13;
support from a specialist in resource planning, will manage the program under the direction of the&#13;
Director-Coordinator of Programs. The group managers' scope of duties has been determined by the&#13;
expected initial work and is functionally divided as indicated in the staffing tables. These are expected&#13;
to evolve in light of changing priorities. However, there would always be a manager of statistics and&#13;
data.&#13;
5.16.         The group managers will initially have a limited number of direct subordinates. The&#13;
Resource Planning Specialist will assist in assigning researchers/economists and support staff (primarily&#13;
computer operators) to individual outputs. The work, e.g., a policy study, will be allocated to a project&#13;
manager, who will carry out the planning and implementation of the assignment. His or her assignment&#13;
plan will show the need for internal and external resources (either from ministries, Russian academic&#13;
institutes or foreign or Russian experts), on either a full or part-time basis. The internal resources&#13;
(researchers, support staff) will be allocated to the particular project managers in accordance with the&#13;
assignment plan/schedule of staff prepared by the Resource Planning Specialist. The external resources&#13;
needed (individuals or organizations) will be subcontracted in cooperation with the Procurement&#13;
Specialist, in accordance with BEA rules and Bank procedures. The initial Staffing Table is shown in&#13;
Appendix 10.&#13;
5.17.         Staff Remuneration.  Staff remuneration policies and Terms and Conditions of&#13;
Employment are described in the Operations Manual. The BEA will maintain salary levels competitive&#13;
with the market rate in private and international organizations in order to attract the best candidates for&#13;
like positions. The basic salary scale was based on a local comparator study commissioned in November&#13;
1996 based on similar functions in foreign institutions and the Resident Mission. The BEA salary system&#13;
consists of a grading system that ranks positions in terms of responsibilities, required level of qualification&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and job complexity, and a salary scale that ranges from I to 20. Salary reviews will take place regularly,&#13;
and all salary adjustments must be approved by the Director General.&#13;
E. Work Program&#13;
5.18          During negotiations, the BEA agreed that each year, it would prepare for approval by&#13;
its Board of Directors a work program that must be consistent with the Government's economic reform&#13;
priorities. It would consist of studies, either planned or of a quick-response nature, that are requested&#13;
by an outside client or initiated by the BEA. The first-year work program (Appendix 11) was developed&#13;
after assessing the needs of client agencies and establishing priorities in light of the national economic&#13;
agenda. From these general categories, terms of reference have been prepared for the first year of policy&#13;
studies. These have been reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Operations Manual governs the scope&#13;
and execution of the work program. An Output Table identifying the source, management and nature&#13;
of BEA outputs is shown in Appendix 12.&#13;
5.19          The work program should contribute to furthering market-economy and structural reforms&#13;
in Russia. Within this objective, the three principles guiding the selection and orientation of BEA's&#13;
analysis will be growth, efficiency and equity. Using these principles, the Board of Directors has&#13;
identified the highest priorities for studies in the medium-term as being in macroeconomic analysis and&#13;
public finance, financial sector reform and enterprise economics, social policy and growth strategies.&#13;
Topics would be selected after the completion of an overview paper that identifies the major problems&#13;
amenable to policy reform and assigns priorities to the analysis of each problem. Priorities for analysis&#13;
will be determined by rough estimates of: (i) the pay-off from policy reform; (ii) the costs of reform;&#13;
and (iii) the likely speed or realizable schedule of policy reform. The assignment of priorities will be&#13;
based mainly on economic costs and benefits, although at times judgments about the political feasibility&#13;
of reform will be needed. High priorities for analysis will be those that produce large net benefits&#13;
quickly.&#13;
5.20          The BEA will work within an economy-wide perspective and consequently take into&#13;
account the inter-relationships between industries, consumers and taxpayers. In particular, the BEA will&#13;
test the claims of those proposing sector or enterprise-specific advantages through regulation or&#13;
protection. Both through a unit specialized in social sector analysis and, where feasible, by incidence&#13;
analysis of impact of policy options on households, the BEA would seek to advance the Government's&#13;
welfare objectives in making these assessments. To support this analytical work, the project will finance&#13;
improvements in Goskomstat's methodology for household income surveys.&#13;
5.21          A priority in the short term will be to build upon the achievements of the past several&#13;
years by developing a comprehensive medium-term economic program for 1997-98 that would guide the&#13;
1998-99 transformation of the Russian economy to a market-based system. This will require developing&#13;
and expanding upon the policy agenda outlined for 1996 (included in the EFF) in the selected areas of&#13;
BEA focus, e.g., taxation and financial sector reform. The objective would be to help domestic agencies&#13;
by performing appropriate analysis in support of development of an action plan.2/&#13;
12/   In this regard, the BEA would be an important counterpart to the Bank/Fund team in monitoring the EFF agenda.&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.22         As a medium-term target the BEA will develop a consistent framework from which to&#13;
analyze the diverse range of government policies and programs. The intention will be to indicate the&#13;
most important options to promote the guiding principles of growth, efficiency and equity.&#13;
5.23         Work program priorities would evolve in light of national priorities. Examples of the&#13;
types of issues that might be explored within each theme include:&#13;
*     Macroeconomic Analysis and Public Finance: macroeconomic and growth strategies,&#13;
taxation of natural resources, budget priorities, intergovernmental fiscal transfer&#13;
mechanisms&#13;
*     Growth and Efficiency: private financial markets; savings and investment; regulatory&#13;
policy (including monopoly and pro-competition); sectoral performance (agriculture,&#13;
industry, infrastructure, energy); international economics (trade, external debt, balance&#13;
of payments).&#13;
*     Developing social sector reforms: employment, incomes and poverty.&#13;
F. Legal Framework&#13;
5.24         Rationale for Non-Commercial Foundation Status. The BEA was established as a non-&#13;
commercial foundation, which is a legally autonomous entity pursuant to the Civil Code. This legal status&#13;
allows the BEA to have independence and thus, greater objectivity in its analytic work. Moreover, civil&#13;
service salary scales are not sufficient to attract the quality economists needed for it to become a viable&#13;
policy analysis institute, and Russian law prohibits civil servants from receiving payments that exceed&#13;
official salary scales. The establishment of BEA as a non-commercial foundation followed the precedent&#13;
set in several Bank projects, including the Management and Financial Training Project (3824-RU) and&#13;
the Legal Reform Project (4035-RU), under which the National Training Foundation and the Foundation&#13;
for Legal Reform were founded as non-commercial foundations.&#13;
5.25         Accountability to the Government.  Nevertheless, the BEA will be accountable to&#13;
Government by means of its Charter, the Government decree permitting the BEA's establishment (Decree&#13;
# 1025 dated July 1, 1996), a second Government decree (to be issued) establishing the regulatory&#13;
framework for Government participation in the BEA, and the documentation supporting the Bank Loan.&#13;
As a condition of negotiations, the Government confirmed the First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy&#13;
as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The General Assembly, which approved the Charter and&#13;
appointed the Boards of Trustees and Directors, is comprised of the principal economic agencies of&#13;
Government, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Central Bank, Goskomstat, the&#13;
State Property Committee (GKI) and the State Anti-Monopoly Committee. Well-respected academic&#13;
institutes, including the Academy of National Economy and the Higher School of Economics, comprise&#13;
the remainder of the institutional representatives on these bodies. The BEA has been established pursuant&#13;
to a Government decree. The Charter requires a majority of the Boards of Trustees and Directors to&#13;
be representatives of governmental agencies. In addition to the Loan Agreement between the Bank and&#13;
the Borrower (GOR), the BEA agreed on the contents of a Project Agreement with the Bank.&#13;
5.26         Legal Establishment of the BEA under Russian Law. The BEA was registered with the&#13;
Ministry of Justice according to Russian law, for which it had to complete the following actions to&#13;
establish itself as a legal foundation: (i) convened a Founders' meeting, at which time the Founders,&#13;
which are required to be non-governmental institutions, invited governmental bodies to join as Participants&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of what then became the General Assembly; (ii) the General Assembly adopted the BEA's charter,&#13;
elected the Board of Directors and Board of Trustees, and named its Director General; (ii) approved and&#13;
officially signed off on the minutes of the Founders' meeting; (iii) registered with the Ministry of Justice&#13;
as a legal entity, which required, inter alia, that the BEA have an official address. Each of these steps&#13;
has been completed. Given that the BEA is registered as a legal entity, it can officially open a bank&#13;
account and hire staff.&#13;
G. Cost Recovery, Budget and Financing Mechanisms&#13;
5.27         Cost Recovery. In order to lay the basis for financial sustainability over the medium&#13;
term, the BEA will require that agencies contribute to the cost of each study. The BEA will need to&#13;
develop a reputation for excellent analytical work in order to derive significant cost recovery for its&#13;
studies. Until such reputation is established, the BEA has reached agreement with the Ministry of&#13;
Economy on interim procedures to govern MOE's contribution to the first-year work program.&#13;
Thereafter, the Scientific Secretary will be designated as the BEA official in charge of business&#13;
development for the purpose of canvassing client ministries to assess cost recovery potential. The&#13;
objective would be to express the needs of client ministries as actual and specific demand supported by&#13;
funding.&#13;
5.28         Budget and Financing Mechanisms. BEA's budget will depend on its work program,&#13;
which will in turn dictate its human resource needs. The first-year staff and consultant budget was&#13;
developed by BEA and approved by the Bank on the basis of the draft work program. It is expected that&#13;
this will evolve with experience during the course of the year, on which basis amendments would be&#13;
needed for the following year's budget. Similarly, BEA's financing plan will evolve annually according&#13;
to improvements in cost recovery. Consequently, BEA agreed that, by an agreed date each year, BEA&#13;
shall submit to the Bank for review its proposed budget andfinancing plan, which must be satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. The Government will finance its share of BEA's annual expenditures through the&#13;
Ministry of Education, which will in turn pass the funds to the BEA. The financing mechanism is&#13;
included in an Agent Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and BEA. As a condition of&#13;
negotiations, the Government provided a draft Agent Agreement, which was acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
that specifies the commitment of the Borrower to contribute its local cost share, as identified in the&#13;
annual budget. Signing of the Agent Agreement between the BEA and Borrower is a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;

A. Project Costs&#13;
6.1           The total project cost is estimated at $36.8 million, including contingencies amounting&#13;
to about $2.8 million and taxes amounting to $2.4 million. The Bank would finance about $22.6 million&#13;
or 61 percent of total project costs. Project costs include technical assistance (both foreign and local),&#13;
equipment, training, and incremental operating costs on a declining basis incurred during the&#13;
implementation period. The estimated project cost summaries are shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2; the&#13;

Assumptions in Estimating Project Costs&#13;
6.2           All project costs are based on December 1996 prices. Project costs were estimated as&#13;
follows:&#13;
a.    Investment Costs ($19.2 million)&#13;
*      Technical Assistance (TA).  TA costs were derived from  recent fees quoted for&#13;
comparative specialized services in Bank-financed projects in Russia. Both foreign and&#13;
local consultants will be responsible for any tax liability incurred in the course of the&#13;
project.&#13;
*      Most of the research and analysis conducted by the BEA will be carried out with the&#13;
assistance of local consultants contracted on both short- and long-term bases. The cost&#13;
estimate for local consultants is between $2,000 and $4,000 per person-month.&#13;
*      Some foreign TA  will be needed to guide BEA  staff and local consultants in&#13;
internationally-recognized analytical techniques in selected policy areas. The cost of&#13;
foreign TA is estimated at US$20,000 per person-month, which includes fees, travel,&#13;
housing and subsistence, and overheads.&#13;
*      Training. The cost of participating in training programs abroad was calculated at $8,000&#13;
per person-month, and was based on the cost of programs similar to those envisioned&#13;
under the loan. This cost includes the training itself, travel, housing and subsistence, and&#13;
insurance.&#13;
*      Equipment. Equipment unit costs were based on recent quotations from local suppliers&#13;
in Moscow.&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
b.     Recurrent Costs ($17.6 million). The Bank would finance incremental recurrent costs&#13;
on a declining basis over the life of the project, from about 80 percent in year 1 to 20&#13;
percent in year 5.&#13;
Incremental Staff. Incremental staff costs were estimated on the basis of a November-&#13;
1996 study of current competitive rates for local staff in the private sector and in&#13;
international financial organizations operating in Moscow.&#13;
c.     PPF ($1.5 million). In order to assure a smooth start-up following loan effectiveness,&#13;
the PPF will be used to finance initial establishment of the BEA, including refurbishment&#13;
of the facilities, rent, furniture, initial office technology equipment, office operating costs,&#13;
staff salaries, training, and consulting services.&#13;
6.3           Local Cost Contributions. The GOR would finance the following costs:&#13;
*      Rent. Based on the terms of a five-year lease signed in February 1997, monthly rent and&#13;
utilities are $650 per square meter per year. The BEA will occupy and pay rent on&#13;
approximately 500 square meters of office space and have access to another 500 square&#13;
meters of facilities, to include conference rooms, a library, and an auditorium. The&#13;
additional area is being financed by the GOR as part of its local cost contribution.&#13;
*      Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M).  The GOR would finance the O&amp;M  of all&#13;
equipment purchased under the project (e.g., computers, xerox machines, etc.), which&#13;
is estimated at 5 percent of equipment cost.&#13;
*      Contributions to Policy Studies. A Government contribution is required for each output&#13;
requested by a Government agency. In all cases, this would include the time of ministry&#13;
staff assigned to work on the study team led by the BEA. A financial contribution is also&#13;
expected in the first year of project operation. Financing for each study requested by a&#13;
government agency will be transferred from the budget of the respective ministry. The&#13;
BEA already received a contract for two of its first-year studies.&#13;
B. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
6.4           The so-called "CPPR Conditions", agreed for all projects in the Russia program by the&#13;
Government and Bank in February 1996, have been fulfilled. This includes hiring of the start-up team,&#13;
(including the Director-Coordinator of Programs, the Manager of Administration, Chief Account,&#13;
procurement specialist, and a senior economist). All procurement documentation for critical first-year&#13;
activities has been received, including terms of reference and lead consultants or staff for the first group&#13;
of policy studies. The lease has been signed for BEA premises, and temporary offices are available while&#13;
minor refurbishment is being undertaken. A contract has been signed with a management consultant to&#13;
assist with initial procurement, to establish procurement and accounting systems, and to train BEA staff&#13;
in these areas. This preparatory step should ensure rapid initiation of project activities upon loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
6.5          Components A and B of the project would be implemented by the BEA, and component&#13;
C would be implemented by Goskomstat with assistance in procurement and disbursed from BEA. BEA&#13;
has been formed as a non-commercial foundation reporting to the First Deputy Prime Minister for&#13;
Economy. The Minister for economic policy and Bank Alternate Governor was appointed Chairman of&#13;
the Board of Directors. A Board of Trustees chaired by the First DPM for Economy was also&#13;
designated. A Director General is designated and has been confirmed by the Board of Directors and a&#13;
President (non-paid liaison to Government) has been appointed by the First Deputy Prime Minister for&#13;
Economy. The BEA is registered as a legal entity. Candidates for the Academic Council, to be&#13;
comprised of eminent economists, both Russian and foreign, have been identified and are being invited&#13;
to participate. The Academic Council will provide quality control for staff appointments and BEA&#13;
outputs. Guidance for institutional and project management is included in the Operations Manual. Start-&#13;
up costs were financed by a sub-project under the Portfolio Development Loan (3844-RU). A PPF was&#13;
approved for final preparation and early implementation activities.&#13;
6.6          Implementation would be phased in a gradual manner. During year 1 more effort would&#13;
be devoted to obtain the office equipment, computer equipment, Local Area Network, customization of&#13;
software, books and publications for the Library, and fewer policy related work as compared to Year&#13;
2. Year 1 staffing is initially expected to be about 27 (see Appendix 10). Project Administrative Unit&#13;
staff would consist, inter alia, of a Procurement Specialist who would be trained in the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Procedures, and who will be responsible for the procurement of goods and other services.&#13;
6.7          It is envisaged that the BEA, inter alia, may be required to quickly respond to the&#13;
Government's request for flexible response papers which may be about 25% of the BEA's annual work&#13;
program. In order to carry out tasks of such exigent nature, the Bureau would have to develop&#13;
streamlined procurement procedures for acquiring specialists depending on the needs of the Government.&#13;
These assignments are likely to be small, short-term contracts. To employ consultants on short notice,&#13;
while still permitting adequate Bank oversight, the BEA and the Bank agreed on an appropriate&#13;
procurement plan wherein BEA would develop a roster of consultants from different disciplines and&#13;
experience, through advertisement and further screening. The BEA would submit the consultant's roster&#13;
(which is to be updated periodically) for the Bank's review and comments. The funds set aside for the&#13;
tasks described above would be capped at, e.g., no more than 25 % of the annual budget and an aggregate&#13;
of $1.5 million.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
6.8          All Bank-financed works, goods and consulting services will be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1981), and&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (1981)&#13;
respectively. International Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (NS) procurement will use commercial&#13;
documentation acceptable to the Bank that will be adequate for later review and audit purposes. The&#13;
BEA's Administration Department will be responsible for tracking procurement actions and approvals as&#13;
well as periodic reporting to the Bank on procurement progress. Additional details on expected&#13;
procurement actions are provided in Appendix 5. A summary of procurement categories and procurement&#13;
methods is shown in Table 6.3. A General Procurement Notice will be issued in the second quarter of&#13;
1997.&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a.    The majority of procurement actions under the proposed project will be for consulting&#13;
services. To insure that the standard of consultants procured under the project is of&#13;
sufficiently high quality, the BEA will submit for Bank's prior review, terms of reference&#13;
for all consulting contracts. In addition, the BEA will develop a roster of Consultants&#13;
in various disciplines based on a competitive recruitment process. The qualifications of&#13;
the candidates selected by BEA management will be pre-screened by the Academic&#13;
Council prior to their review and no-objection by the Bank. In this manner, high quality&#13;
standards will be maintained while providing flexibility to BEA.&#13;
b.    Technical Assistance and Consulting Services.  Approximately US$8.5 million in&#13;
Consulting Services contracts will provide foreign and local technical assistance for&#13;
individual specialists/advisors, studies, training programs, seminars, and workshops&#13;
arising under two major components of the project (i.e., Policy Studies and Improving&#13;
National Accounts). The procurement method to be used for acquiring Technical&#13;
Assistance and Consulting Services would be in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency, dated 1981. Under the Policy Studies component, TA would assist&#13;
the Bureau in the production of a number of regular outputs, including medium-term and&#13;
quick-response policy studies as well as the annual report on the state of the economy and&#13;
the quarterly economic indicators. Under the Improving National Accounts component,&#13;
TA would assist the Government in the improvement of the quality of economic statistics&#13;
through the provision of training, seminars, and workshops. The number of contracts&#13;
to be administered for TA and Consulting Services for these purposes under the two&#13;
components will be directly linked to the development and submission of the annual work&#13;
program of the BEA.&#13;
c.    Recurrent Costs. These costs include compensation for the BEA's professional and&#13;
support staff and operating costs of the BEA. The staff proposed to be employed should&#13;
be experienced, capable, and their terms and conditions of employment should be&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and subject to prior review. Leasing of premises for the BEA was&#13;
based on obtaining at least three quotations from rental agencies in Moscow. For all&#13;
goods and equipment purchases which fall in the category of recurrent costs, NS will be&#13;
used for contracts below $50,000. IS will be used for contracts greater than $50,000 but&#13;
less than $300,000. In addition, the Bank will conduct prior reviews of all contracts of&#13;
goods above $100,000.&#13;

E. Disbursements&#13;
6.9           The loan is expected to be fully disbursed over 5 years, closing on September 30, 2003.&#13;
The Bank would finance: (i) 100% of expenditures for consultant services; (ii) 100% of expenditures for&#13;
study tours and other training; and (iii) for equipment, 100% of foreign expenditures for direct imports,&#13;
100% of local ex-factory costs for locally manufactured items and 80% of local expenditures for other&#13;
items procured locally. Incremental recurrent costs, excluding rent, would be financed on a declining&#13;
scale, from 100% in year one to 20% in year five. Table 6.4 gives the estimated project disbursement&#13;
schedule.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.10         Special Account.  To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars&#13;
in a commercial bank in Russia. During the early stages of the project, the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account would be limited to US$600,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under&#13;
the loan reach $5 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$&#13;
1.2 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should&#13;
be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other&#13;
appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
6.11         The commercial bank holding the SA has been chosen on the basis of open competitive&#13;
bidding, which, as a pre-condition, is required to meet the following criteria:&#13;
i.    it should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts which&#13;
would be audited by an internationally recognized audit firm;&#13;
ii.    have significant foreign correspondence banking in all major currencies;&#13;
iii.   have some experience, or at least the capacity to acquire experience, in issuing&#13;
letters of credit, transacting direct foreign payments;&#13;
iv.    be a member of SWIFT, or plan to use the facility to expedite payments;&#13;
v.    be willing and able to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited&#13;
in the SA would not be set off, seized or otherwise attached to satisfy amounts&#13;
due to the commercial bank by the Borrower;&#13;
vi.   be willing and able to adequately maintain accounts as required by the Bank,&#13;
including regular statements, and any other information that may be&#13;
considered necessary; and&#13;
vii.   charge competitive rates for services and other transactions fees.&#13;
6.12         Disbursements will be fully documented, except that expenditures related to training,&#13;
study tours and contracts of goods and services valued less than $100,000 would be made on the basis&#13;
of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained at the BEA,&#13;
and made available for review by Bank supervision missions and auditors.&#13;
6.13         Accounts and Audits. The BEA will maintain a single set of project accounts, including&#13;
the Special Account. Project records will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). All project accounts&#13;
(including the Special Account and SOEs) will be subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit report will be submitted to the Bank by the BEA within six&#13;
months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;

RUSSIAN BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PROJECT&#13;
VII. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
7.1          The principal project benefit in the short term will be the preparation of detailed action&#13;
plans in support of the Government's medium-term structural reform agenda. These would result from&#13;
the BEA's ability -- based on access to the necessary skills, data, and collaboration with economic&#13;
agencies -- to provide and mobilize high-quality economic policy advice directly to decision-makers in&#13;
Government, and to help integrate macroeconomic and welfare considerations into sectoral and economy-&#13;
wide reform agendas. Without the project, the lack of systematic and well-coordinated economic&#13;
analysis, especially in the design and implementation of structural reforms, is likely to persist.&#13;
7.2          As a result of the project, the Government is expected to retain and enhance the capacity&#13;
in governmental institutions for analytic economic work. The fellowships/training in mainstream&#13;
economics and policy analysis financed by the project, as well as increased experience in coordinating&#13;
policy development across ministries, will lay the basis for sustainable improvements in Government&#13;
capacity once the loan closes. The project will finance a Training Needs Assessment for economic policy&#13;
analysts in Government, that will guide BEA training strategy. Therefore, a principal benefit in the&#13;
medium-term will be sounder economic analysis based on more reliable National Accounts and improved&#13;
capacity for cross-sectoral analysis.&#13;
Risks&#13;
7.3          The accountability of the Bureau to Government poses risks that are common to all&#13;
governmental advisory bodies. The first is that the BEA's influence may rise or fall depending upon the&#13;
interests and status of its government sponsors. While close association with the office of the First&#13;
Deputy Prime Minister is the most appropriate arrangement at present, flexibility is needed in the event&#13;
of institutional changes. Second, the closer the association with senior government officials, the more&#13;
the work program may become influenced by political considerations. While accountability is important&#13;
to increase the BEA's impact, too close an association can undermine its analytic objectivity. The present&#13;
governance structure combines governmental and non-governmental representatives, with a certain degree&#13;
of flexibility to change the balance of power between them depending upon the circumstances. It also&#13;
combines accountability to a senior Government official -- the First Deputy Prime Minister -- with&#13;
accountability to economic ministries. This should help maintain the benefits of analytic objectivity while&#13;
minimizing the risks resulting from accountability to Government. However, the tension between&#13;
objectivity and accountability exists in all governmental advisory bodies and cannot be removed entirely&#13;
by the project design.&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.4           Another risk is the lack of a tradition of coordination and information-sharing across&#13;
layers of Government and among economic agencies, which is critical for cross-sectoral analysis. Rather,&#13;
authority tends to be concentrated in institutions headed by prominent individuals, who prefer to compete&#13;
rather than cooperate. The governance structure of the BEA has been designed to reduce the risk of&#13;
insularity by giving authority to a broader group of stakeholders (economic agencies and institutes) who&#13;
would both direct the BEA and be its primary clients. This will particularly be the case for Goskomstat,&#13;
without which the data requirements for economic analysis could not be met.&#13;
7.5    Finally, the staff recruitment process may not be sufficiently competitive to meet the quality&#13;
standards required to maintain the BEA as a center of excellence. This is a particular risk with enclave&#13;
projects because it can intensify institutional rivalries with civil servants. The risk is further intensified&#13;
if first-year products are less than exemplary. This risk has been discussed at length with BEA&#13;
management and various strategies have been developed in response. First, technical criteria for each&#13;
staff position have been developed. These would be monitored through observance of compliance with&#13;
the Bank's procurement process (competitive selection) and by the quality control function of the&#13;
Academic Council, which will review requirements for staff qualifications as well as candidates for&#13;
individual positions. Second, a training program for all BEA analysts and their key counterparts in&#13;
government will take place in the first year on the National Accounts framework and in analytic&#13;
techniques, to establish a quality standard in the early phase of the project. Finally, international&#13;
expertise or study tours are required as inputs to all policy studies up to and including year three of the&#13;
project.&#13;

APPENDIx 2&#13;
IMPROVING THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS&#13;
The statistical component of the Bureau project will contribute to improvement of short term (monthly and&#13;
quarterly) macroindicators, as well as annual estimates. The GOR needs timely and reasonably reliable&#13;
short term macro-information for monitoring economic developments and for policy decisions. It will also&#13;
finance surveys to collect data currently not available but very important for estimates of macroindicators&#13;
and for design of economic and social policy.&#13;
The component will be facilitated by a statistical group (unit) at the Bureau. ft will be staffed with five&#13;
people. Two statisticians - one high level and one of research assistant, both working on a permanent&#13;
(contractual) basis. Three high level statisticians will be working at the Bureau on secondment from&#13;
Goskomstat. The arrangements can be made for them to work on a rotation basis through annual&#13;
contracts. This will ensure a good working relationship between Goskomstat and the Bureau.&#13;
The statistical component will cover the following:&#13;
i.    Creating an                at Goskomstat for improvement of estimates of short term&#13;
macroindicators and annual estimates. This component covers the following:&#13;
a) financing procurement of hardware and software for a local area network at the Department&#13;
of National Accounts and Balance of Payments.&#13;
Creation of a LAN with powerful servers for data storage will enable statisticians to share information&#13;
allowing the Bureau to receive needed information via modem. On the other hand it has to establish links&#13;
between Goskomstat and other Government agencies data producers. Links have to be established with&#13;
Ministry of Finance (Government finance statistics), Central Bank (monetary survey) and Customs&#13;
Department (foreign trade statistics). All these data are needed on a timely basis for Goskomstat to be able&#13;
to produce estimates of macroindicators.&#13;
To ensure that the Department of National Accounts is able to use data from the department of Input-&#13;
Output analysis of Goskomstat (importance of good input-output table for national accounts is described in&#13;
the Report on Russian national accounts) hardware will be provided for this Department'.&#13;
b) financing improvement of the process of estimation of short term economic indicators.&#13;
Goskomstat has adopted a time table for estimation of monthly, quarterly and annual estimates,&#13;
reconciliation of estimates, and a general policy for revision of estimates following the recommendations&#13;
of the working group of experts authors of the Goskomstat - World Bank study on the Russian national&#13;
accounts&#13;
1 It is planned to supply the Department of Input-Output Analysis with a very limited amount of hardware and&#13;
software purchased with funds from an IDF grant, if the project will be approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The time table is proposed as follows:&#13;
First estimates of basic monthly macroindicators based on trends and ratios - end of the month.&#13;
Second estimate of indicators based on monthly statistics (what available) - 15 days after the month&#13;
ends.&#13;
First estimate of quarterly macroindicators based on second estimates of the first two months and first&#13;
estimate of the third month - end of the last month of the quarter.&#13;
Second estimate of the quarterly data based on second estimates of the three months - 15 days after the&#13;
third month ends.&#13;
Reconciliation of estimates for three months and quarterly estimates based on quarterly statistics - a&#13;
month after the quarter ends.&#13;
Revisions of quarterly estimates are also performed after the fourth and seventh month after the quarter&#13;
ends.&#13;
Final revision of all the quarters is done in March of the following year.&#13;
First estimates of annual data based on twelve months - in January of the following year..&#13;
Second estimate of annual data based on data for four quarters - in March of the following year.&#13;
Third estimate of the annual data based on annual statistics - in October of the following year.&#13;
Fourth estimate based on annual estimates and reconciliation with estimates for the four quarters - in&#13;
March of the year next to the following.&#13;
Fifth estimate of annual data on new benchmarks derived from an input - output table developed once in&#13;
five years - after the table is developed.&#13;
The estimates may be performed for five years back. After these estimates are done, the annual data are&#13;
considered to be final.&#13;
These changes in the revision policy schedule have to be discussed by the GOR involving Goskomstat,&#13;
Ministries of Economy and Finance, Central Bank, Customs Committee, etc. It has to be an agreement&#13;
reached on a schedule of data flows, needed for national accounts, from the government agencies to&#13;
Goskomstat, as well as flows of data from Goskomstat to the Bureau and other government agencies-data&#13;
users.&#13;
The proposed improvements in the revision policy places additional demands on the staff of the&#13;
Department of National Accounts and Balance of Payments. This project brings additional resources&#13;
needed to improve the time table and revision policy.&#13;
It is proposed to finance the incremental costs for hiring additional (up to 5) staff members at Goskomstat&#13;
for an initial two year period with an understanding that afterwards the costs to be financed by the GOR.&#13;
The new tasks and schedule will also involve training at the statistical offices of other countries -&#13;
Canada, Norway, UK and some others can be good candidates for training. It is planned to have&#13;
training sessions for 15 people. Each person will receive a month of training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It also may involve short term consulting arrangements by experts from other countries experienced in&#13;
estimates of short term macroindicators. Funds are allocated for two months of consulting.&#13;
2.     Strengthening the collection of data critically needed for estimates of national accounts.&#13;
For development of good macroeconomic statistics the "raw' basic data are critical. An analysis of data&#13;
and problems in this area during transition is available in the joint Goskomstat-World Bank report on&#13;
national accounts. It is proposed that this project finance data collection (surveys) in two critical areas:&#13;
a) new household surveys based on changing the sample and questionnaire in the old family&#13;
budget survevy&#13;
Development of a reasonable social policy in the Russian Federation is currently affected by lack of&#13;
reliable data on household income and expenditure. The existing family budget surveys have sampling&#13;
problems that do not allow the gathering of reliable information about income distribution and expenditure&#13;
patterns. This in turn, does not allow the Government to conduct its social protection policy and develop&#13;
targeted measures to reduce poverty. The questionnaires which were designed many years ago do not&#13;
allow the collection of data on income from the non-state sector, non-cash and non-wage income,&#13;
expenditures on goods and services supplied by new emerging private enterprises, etc. The sampling&#13;
errors do not allow the gathering of reliable information on income and expenditure distribution by region&#13;
of the Russian Federation, which is very important given the size of the country, differentiation of&#13;
economic development, and price levels in the regions.&#13;
Good information on household income and expenditure is critical for estimation of national accounts. It is&#13;
the basis of estimating retail trade turnover, value and volume of services offered by the economy to the&#13;
population. for example. On the expenditure side the data are used to estimate household consumption.&#13;
On the income side of the accounts it is used to estimate household income and profits of small -&#13;
household owned businesses.The project would be launched along the lines as proposed in Mr. Juan&#13;
Muoz's report to the World Bank in January 1996, prepared after his visit to Goskomstat of the Russian&#13;
Federation (report available).&#13;
b) Survey of new private enterprises in different sectors of the economy.&#13;
Economic reform brought into the market hundreds and thousands of small, mostly privately owned&#13;
businesses in different sectors of the economy. For a number of reasons economic activities of these&#13;
enterprises are poorly captured by data collection methods employed by Goskomstat. Estimates are done&#13;
to assess the volume and value of output of goods and services produced by those enterprises. These&#13;
activities are estimated to be 20-30% of GDP. Information on these activities is very important to the&#13;
Govemment for design of fiscal policy. The share of income generated by these businesses is increasing&#13;
and has an increasing effect on execution of the state budget. It is very important to have information on&#13;
these economic activities for estimates of macroindicators which in tum are used for policy decisions.&#13;
The size of the sample will be determined in discussions with Goskomstat based on the coverage needed.&#13;
It is proposed to allocate up to $800 thousand in the project for this survey.&#13;
3.     Assistance to support the subscription of the Russian Federation to the Special Data Dissemination&#13;
Standards. (SDDS)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Goskomstat of the Russian Federation is interested in subscribing to the IMF SDDS with an understanding&#13;
that they will join the initiative in 1998. Goskomstat will start shortly discussions with other agencies -&#13;
Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and Customs Committee about their willingness and readiness to&#13;
participate. If the discussions will end in an agreement Goskomstat will need to improve only one&#13;
indicator, from all the requested indicators which fall under Goskomstat's domain. It is quarterly&#13;
information on labor markets - employment, unemployment, wages, income, etc.&#13;
Goskomstat has launched a labor survey according to ILO methodology which is what IMF is requesting.&#13;
However, lack of funds do not allow Goskomstat to do it on a quarterly basis - it is an annual survey.&#13;
Goskomstat would need at least $600 thousand in 1997 or 1998 to launch the survey on a quarterly basis.&#13;
It is proposed to allocate in the project the above amount with the Government's understanding that&#13;
starting in 1999 GOR will finance this survey on a quarterly basis.&#13;

1. Macroeconomic Monetary Policy&#13;
The state still retains a strong position in the Russian economy and protectionism in&#13;
the form of subsidizing losses due to mismanagement and hopeless loss-making production&#13;
entities has not been eradicated. However, the role of the state in regulating economic&#13;
processes is still weak and ill-defined. In the macroeconomic sphere monetary regulatory&#13;
bodies have managed to achieve control of the main ruble aggregates. The circulation of&#13;
surrogate money, however, is totally unregulated. The issue of surrogates is a serious brake&#13;
on the implementation of macroeconomic policy leading to growing defaults on payments and&#13;
errors in forecasting the main macroeconomic indicators, including the GDP. It raises the&#13;
question of the prospects of the development of this segment of money circulation. Another&#13;
problem is the lack of adequate macroeconomic forecasting instruments, which prevents&#13;
evaluation and analysis of medium-range prospects of economic development of Russia.&#13;
Features of the present-day macroeconomic policy. Considering the very mixed results&#13;
of progress towards the market at the macro level, including the monetary sphere, an analysis&#13;
of macroeconomic policy in the context of slow structural reform is imperative. The search&#13;
for macroeconomic solutions calls for the study of a number of specific short-term trends&#13;
caused by the flaws in the structural and institutional policy in the transitional period. The&#13;
implementation of the monetary policy in turn requires that two priority issues be addressed:&#13;
a) how to diminish the role of surrogates in money circulation; and b) to what extent and due&#13;
to what causes the danger of further dollarization of the Russian economic persists.&#13;
Middle-range macroeconomic policy prospects. An analysis of this problem&#13;
presupposes first and foremost a development of a model for medium-range macroeconomic&#13;
forecasting. Attempts to develop such a model were made by the IMF and the EBRD. These&#13;
were essentially balance models whose main aim was to see that there are no contradictions&#13;
between basic premises as regards GDP structure, budget, the balance of payments and the&#13;
balance of savings. A group of Russian experts is already developing a medium-range&#13;
econometric model. The U.S. Treasury is expected to help in the implementation of that task.&#13;
It would be useful to combine all efforts under the Economic Analysis Office considering the&#13;
broad possibilities of that organization in terms of enlisting the services of qualified&#13;
consultants and the use of research results in the government's conduct of economic policy.&#13;

2.    Tax and Budget Policy. Regional Transfers. Social Sphere Financing&#13;
The reduction of the state budget deficit and the rate of inflation has yet to bring&#13;
about a cardinal improvement of Russia's financial position. The main cause is the&#13;
contraction of budgetary expenditure because of the low tax collectability. Cuts in budget&#13;
spending were not accompanied by adequate structural transformations. Budgetary spending&#13;
is under heavy pressure to cover the losses of non-government enterprises. Another aspect&#13;
of the current policy is substantial undercollection of taxes, largely due to indirect support&#13;
of virtual bankrupts through non-payments or direct failure to pay taxes to the federal budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
The issue of surrogate money, which has assumed dangerous proportions, is a way of&#13;
avoiding taxes for enterprises and imposing budgetary restrictions on local budgets. In&#13;
developing a tax and budgetary policy in Russia one has to bear in mind that the&#13;
contributions of enterprises to the pension and social funds, which are impossible to cancel,&#13;
account for more than 11 percent of the GDP.&#13;
Structural aspects of thle fiscal policy. A comprehensive analysis of the factors which&#13;
cause low tax collectability stemming from a lack of coherent structural policy is of primary&#13;
importance. The solution of that problem hinges on a consistent development of effective&#13;
mechanisms to remove the structural barriers in the way of tax payments into the federal&#13;
budget.&#13;
The role of subsidies in fiscal policy. In the first place, the scale and sources of&#13;
hidden and overt subventions of various economic agents should be analyzed. Specifically,&#13;
it is necessary to assess to what extent this is subsidized by federal and local budgets, and&#13;
what role the off-budget funds play. The aim of this research is to find ways to reduce or&#13;
eliminate the channels for unwarranted subsidizing.&#13;
Medium-range budget strategy. A separate study must be devoted to the level and&#13;
economic structure of budgetary spending and the size of the budget deficit. Such a study&#13;
may provide the basis for budgetary strategy in the coming years. There must be a broad&#13;
discussion of possible changes in government policy to ensure for the budget the role of&#13;
stimulant of economic activity and a stabilizing macroeconomic factor. It would also be&#13;
useful to assess the concrete significance of budgetary means for the financing of the&#13;
economy and the servicing of the state debt and reveal the actual share of the sources that&#13;
support these functions of the federal budget.&#13;

3.    Support of Entrepreneurship. Anti-Monopoly Policy, Natural Monopolies&#13;
The Russian economy is still highly monopolized. One of the main causes is continued&#13;
significant government participation in the economy and poor development of small and&#13;
medium enterprises capable of competing with the former 'monsters". It is no accident that&#13;
while incomes are substantially lower than in Europe, the prices for a number of goods,&#13;
including daily necessities, have exceeded the average European level. The quality of the&#13;
goods and services provided domestically is fairly low. This is particularly true of the&#13;
services market where there is virtually no foreign competition. In some sectors services of&#13;
acceptable quality are unavailable.&#13;
Large-scale production and anti-monopoly policy. The high level of monopolization&#13;
in the planned economy was intimately connected with the activities of giant industrial&#13;
enterprises. Eliminating the consequences of former monopolism is complicated by the&#13;
possible appearance of new entities which behave in a monopolistic way. These include the&#13;
financial-industrial groups (FIGs), and vertically integrated oil companies. The main aspects&#13;
of anti-monopoly policy that call for broad discussion and mutually coordinated decisions&#13;
involve the study of the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
* what is the relationship, in terms of macro-economic effectiveness, between such&#13;
methods of combating monopolism as downsizing of giant enterprises and the creation.&#13;
instead, of small and medium production entities;&#13;
* what is the actual impact on the degree of monopolization exerted by the activities&#13;
of the FIGs, especially those created 'from the top' by administrative decree.&#13;
Regulation of natural monopolies. It is necessary, above all, to determine the reasons&#13;
why the corresponding law and regulatory acts fail to ensure effective control of the activities&#13;
of natural monopolies and their expenditures. As a result, there is considerable room for&#13;
arbitrary price-fixing and cross-subsidizing of tariffs and for providing inferior quality&#13;
services. A possible answer to the problem could be a statutory act that would allow the&#13;
prices and tariffs of natural monopolies to be challenged, specifically, when services are&#13;
substandard.&#13;
The problem of the merger of natural monopolies with government agencies called&#13;
upon to regulate them must be the subject of broad public discussion. The analysis must take&#13;
into account that the government ministries and departments all too often act as lobbies for&#13;
the interests of the monopolies before the budget and the public, rather than instruments of&#13;
supervising them.&#13;
Consumer goods market. The consumer market has become quite competitive, mainly&#13;
due to large amounts of imported goods. This prompts the need to study the issue to what&#13;
extent the increase of import duties contributes to the monopolization of the consumer&#13;
market, an issue that is of direct relevance to decision-making in the anti-monopoly sphere&#13;
and in foreign trade.&#13;
A distinct problem that calls for a preliminary study is the market policy of retail&#13;
networks. Their prices are not going down despite the prerequisites for competitive behavior,&#13;
which would seem to suggest the presence of a conspiracy or the existence of a single&#13;
monopoly boss. To make decisions in this area it is necessary to find out whether the&#13;
behavior of the owners of retail networks reflects a growing monopoly trend or some other&#13;
processes.&#13;
4.    Industrial Policy, Accumulation and Investments.&#13;
Economic Growth&#13;
Russia has not yet overcome an investment crisis. The volume of investment continues&#13;
to shrink. Centralized expenditure as opposed to the own assets of enterprises still accounts&#13;
for a comparatively large share of the sources of financing. The amount of borrowed&#13;
financial resources is insignificant. This is true of bank credits and foreign investments as&#13;
well as the savings of households. Along with an obvious structural shift of investment&#13;
toward the services sphere there remain sectors which have been virtually untouched by&#13;
market transformations -- the Military-industrial Complex and agriculture.&#13;
Main types and sources of accumulation. In view of the fact that less than half of the&#13;
total volume of depreciation deductions goes into investments it is necessary to determine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
what the state can do to change the situation. One should draw attention to such possible&#13;
measures as the development of more detailed standards of writing-off, account of the&#13;
changes in the cost of certain types of assets and their regular re-evaluation, and strict control&#13;
of the use of depreciation deductions.&#13;
The profits of enterprises as a source of financing cannot be increased through direct&#13;
government intervention. Even so, two specific questions require analysis: a) to what extent&#13;
a cut of profit tax can enlarge the accumulation fund given poor tax collection and a lack of&#13;
inclination to invest; b) what can be the impact, in terms of giving a greater role to profit&#13;
in financing, of the creation of German-type long-term pension funds whose assets are used&#13;
by companies as borrowed capital and are included in the liabilities of the balance sheet.&#13;
Extending the range of financing channels. Analysis must focus, first, on finding out&#13;
to what extent the removal from circulation of quasi-money and surrogate money used only&#13;
for current transaction settlements (treasury bonds and tax exemptions, growing mass of bills&#13;
of exchange issued against government guarantees) will increase real money supply; and&#13;
second, how a reduction of the budget deficit will affect the growth of accumulations.&#13;
Conditions for accumulation. It would be useful to conduct an empirical study to&#13;
determine to what extent accumulation is stimulated by the desire to invest as a result of&#13;
economic stability and by the development of the legal mechanisms of reform. The real&#13;
condition for growing investments may be a cut of the real interest rate and reduction of the&#13;
share of government borrowing which creates a 'displacement effect' in the credit market.&#13;
The question of the impact of the state on resumption of economic growth through a full-&#13;
scale industrial policy and revision of the basic approach to privatization calls for serious&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Possibilities of economic growth. The main factors of economic growth should be&#13;
monitored. The impact of industrial policy on the development of individual sectors&#13;
(industry, agriculture, the services). This must involve an analysis of the investment climate&#13;
to see how favorable conditions for investment can be created. A separate area of analysis&#13;
must be devoted to competition in high-technology markets and the possible role of the state.&#13;
5.    Agrarian and Land Policy&#13;
In terms of the main economic indicators (production volume, effectiveness of the use&#13;
of production inputs) the situation in the agrarian sector continues to worsen. Agriculture and&#13;
food production are ill-equipped for operating in a market environment. The government has&#13;
yet to develop a coherent and realistic conception of reform in agriculture. Clearly, the state&#13;
has limited resources to support producers and end users of agricultural produce. The priority&#13;
government decisions must aim at effective use of available resources, stimulating and&#13;
supporting private farming.&#13;
Prospects for the development of the agrarian sector. The first issue that needs&#13;
investigation is to what extent the incentives for agricultural production have been suppressed&#13;
and what is the role of subsidies, especially easy-term subsidies of agricultural enterprises.&#13;
It is important to determine the scale of regional dispersion and the role of subsidies in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
bringing down the producers' prices. An empirical study of the possible consequences of&#13;
government price subsidies for the correlation of prices, incomes and trade mark-ups in the&#13;
agrarian sector could be the next stage in the study. The possible use of mortgage transaction&#13;
mechanisms must also be assessed.&#13;
Change in the organization of agricultural production. Thle Nizhny Novgorod and&#13;
Oryol models are examples of such change. An adequate legal framework has been created&#13;
in Russia for large-scale reform and rehabilitation of agri-businesses. Work in this direction&#13;
must get political and organizational support at the federal level. The main goal is to provide&#13;
organizational and legal basis for an agricultural land market.&#13;
An analysis and broad public discussion are needed of the possible structural policy&#13;
in the agro-industrial complex comprising demonopolization of individual sectors,&#13;
encouragement of small and medium production and trade firms in rural areas, including&#13;
credit, marketing and other forms of cooperatives.&#13;
Decision-making must be based on the study of the activities of privatized agricultural&#13;
firms in terms of the current and future competition and opportunities for foreign investment.&#13;
In this context, the relationship between competition and local monopoly, mark-ups and costs&#13;
of agricultural produce processing must be studied.&#13;
The Russian model of agrarian development and international experierce. lf decisions&#13;
on the support of private enterprise in the agrarian sector are to be valid, they must be based&#13;
on the study of international data on the size of agricultural enterprises and their effectiveness&#13;
and different forms of agricultural production entities. In the light of world practice the&#13;
question of token and real privatization, the possibility of legally withdrawing from collective&#13;
farms with the means of production that enable new private agriculture to perform well in&#13;
a market economy merits a special study.&#13;
6.    Reform of Enterprises, Corporate IMIanagement. Restructuring of Production&#13;
The extremely low pace of production restructuring is the main obstacle to&#13;
modernization of the sectoral structure of the economy and restoration of investments. As a&#13;
result of privatization, real power in the enterprises belongs to the former managers who are&#13;
as a rule unable to respond adequately to the tough requirements of the market. The former&#13;
organizational structures, methods of production, financial and business activities have&#13;
survived. Marketing and financial management is still a major weakness. Advances in&#13;
Russian industry depend on overcoming the shortage of investment resources and the&#13;
emergence of new channels for the spread of managerial skills.&#13;
Reform of enterprises and government policy. The main subject of analysis is the&#13;
behavior of enterprises in the post-reform period. One of the main problems arising in the&#13;
course of the study is determining whether restructuring of enterprises has made them more&#13;
effective. The question of the adaptation of enterprises to a new market situation (prices,&#13;
competition, pressure of import, the need to use stock market instruments) needs to be&#13;
considered. Another area is the methods by which the state influences the process of&#13;
enterprise reform. It is necessary to study the possible result of the post-privatization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
restructuring including the adoption of new standards of accounting and reporting,&#13;
maintenance of an independence register of shareholders and clear delimitation of&#13;
responsibilities of owners and managers.&#13;
Property, supervision and management of enterprises. The state has proved unable&#13;
to manage its blocks of shares in enterprises. This prompts an all-sided investigation into how&#13;
the state, first, can contribute to the transfer of production assets to such owners as are&#13;
capable of ensuring major investments and effective management: and second, to provide the&#13;
owners of enterprises with real access to their control and management. The next important&#13;
issue that calls for analysis and prompt and sound decisions is what to do with the Russian&#13;
industrial "monsters' (the Integrated Power Grid of Russia, or RAO EEC, Rostelecom,&#13;
Mosenergo and others). A study is needed of the consequences of the choice of this or that&#13;
form of managing the government's share (on the one hand, retention of the assets by the&#13;
state or transfer thereof to the regional authorities which would perpetuate the status quo and,&#13;
on the other hand, transfer in trust to banks or sale through investment tenders). Note should&#13;
be made of the possible temptation to meet budgetary needs through the sale of government&#13;
shares which would discourage the appearance of real strategic investors.&#13;
Bankruptcv of inisolvent enterprises. The practice of bankruptcy is a key mechanism&#13;
for the redistribution of assets in favor of efficient owners and restructuring of production.&#13;
In analyzing the problem it should be borne in mind that technically the majority of Russian&#13;
enterprises are virtual bankrupts. The study must evaluate to what extent large-scale&#13;
application of bankruptcy procedures is held back by the flaws in the existing legislation,&#13;
reluctance of creditors to initiate law suits, resistance to the actions of the Federal Directorate&#13;
for Insolvency on the part of enterprise managers and local authorities, the weakness of&#13;
arbitration courts and enforcement of their decisions. Change hinges on the effectiveness of&#13;
measures with regard to insolvent enterprises in terms of their impact on the quality of&#13;
production management. The emphasis in the development of decisions must be on two&#13;
aspects: a) identifying and removing the main barriers in the way of the application of&#13;
bankruptcy procedures: b) determining the methods of management of potential bankrupts&#13;
irrespective of the mechanism of bankruptcy.&#13;

and World Experience&#13;
7.     Financial System. Financial Inistitutions and Miarkets&#13;
The state of the Russian financial system does not lend itself to a definite assessment.&#13;
The biggest advances have been made in the banking system which, however, experienced&#13;
a major crisis in 1995 and is now poised for a structural transformation because many banks&#13;
have gone bankrupt. Other financial institutions are far less developed. The stock market is&#13;
dominated by government securities which are the most reliable and profitable. But the&#13;
potential of that segment of the market has largely been exhausted while the corporate&#13;
securities market has low liquidity and is hardly developing at all. An inadequate&#13;
infrastructure is a brake on expansion of the stock market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Banks and thlefinancing of industry. Two interconnected problems stand out which&#13;
require profound examination. The first is the evaluation of the prospects of the banking&#13;
system itself. The likely consequences should be assessed of such measures as: a) providing&#13;
a group of leading (spearhead) banks with additional powers accompanied by special&#13;
supervision of their activities; b) the identification of hopeless banks where the interests of&#13;
clients and private investors must be protected; c) the barriers in the way of the creation of&#13;
new banks which are proliferating in excess of the requirements of the economy by setting&#13;
higher authorized capital standards.&#13;
The second problem is the participation of banks in the financing of enterprises. A&#13;
practical study is in order of the prospects and consequences, first, of granting long-term&#13;
bank credits to "inefficient" enterprises (government-owned, defense-related); secondly,&#13;
government support of enterprises which cannot be liquidated for strategic reasons and which&#13;
have been affected by bank bankruptcies.&#13;
Non-banking financial institutions. One of the key problems in this area is&#13;
macroeconomic evaluation of the price and time period of transition to a new type of&#13;
financial institution. The decisions taken must proceed from an analysis to determine the&#13;
current and future economic need for pension funds and insurance companies and in what&#13;
shape these institutions should exist in Russia and how they can be strengthened. With&#13;
respect to investment funds it is necessary to determine whether they are capable of&#13;
performing their main task of attracting large amounts of the population's money. An&#13;
alternative should also be studied of establishing long-term financing funds of banks in order&#13;
to mobilize the assets of households. A separate question that requires study is whether the&#13;
Russian economy needs a large number of investment funds and whether solid foreign&#13;
partners can ensure their survival.&#13;
Prospects of the stock market. In the first place a broad discussion is necessary of the&#13;
prospects of the formation in Russia of a developed and stable stock market using modern&#13;
instruments in which the interests of all the market participants are legally secured. Along&#13;
with such an assessment an analysis is needed of the mechanisms which could make it&#13;
possible to strengthen and protect the national stock market institutions. The question should&#13;
be answered to what extent the solution of this problem can be advanced by the development&#13;
of stock and over-the-counter trading in securities and the creation of a single centralized&#13;
settlement and depositary system. Civilized modes of existence of national producers based&#13;
on the protection of the rights of shareholders must also be studied.&#13;
Borrowed capital niarket. Most projects at present are financed either by the&#13;
enterprises' own capital, by the government budget or EBRD loans. The main challenge in&#13;
making decisions in this area is to see how the capital market can be "lengthened", and how&#13;
investor confidence can be increased. It is necessary to assess: a) the role of state guarantees&#13;
in such matters as stability of taxes and tariffs and terms of project crediting; b) the use of&#13;
the possibilities of the Savings Bank (Sberbank) which commands considerable confidence.&#13;
The problem of risks in the process of investments and savings must be examined. In making&#13;
decisions it should be borne in mind that the confidence of individual and institutional&#13;
investors depends on how reliable the market instruments are and how the risks are shared&#13;
in practice.&#13;

Industry&#13;
8.    Incomes, Employment, Poverty&#13;
The reform of the social sphere is proceeding very slowly exacting a heavy&#13;
macroeconomic, political and social cost, Real per capita incomes fell by 40 percent&#13;
compared with 1991, and the differentiation of incomes between different social strata has&#13;
increased dramatically. Among those hardest hit by the fall of real incomes are families&#13;
with children in whlich one or both working members are employed in the budget-supported&#13;
sphere or in crisis-ridden sectors of production, the families of unemployed people, as well&#13;
as pensioners. The share of the population with incomes below the official "poverty line' has&#13;
never been below 25 percent recently. Unemployment is growing steadily, both in the overt&#13;
and hidden forms. In some regions of Russia unemployment has already reached a critical&#13;
point.&#13;
Reform of the pension system. To solve this problem it is necessary to know how a&#13;
transition from the distributive to the accumulative pension system can improve the position&#13;
of pensioners, ensure regular payment of pensions, guarantee that the size of a pension&#13;
reflects the labor record and is linked to the price index. In the course of the investigation&#13;
it is necessary to clearly determine what market instruments are the best for a viable pension&#13;
system.&#13;
Revision of the system of social support. The main task is to create the necessary&#13;
conditions for targeted assistance to the vulnerable social strata. A close study is needed of&#13;
the existing range of money allowances, privileges and subsidies established under federal&#13;
legislation. Such a review would determine, first, to what extent ineffective schemes that&#13;
have no specific addressee should be curtailed or abolished altogether; secondly, what&#13;
allowances and benefits should be made available only on condition of compliance with clear-&#13;
cut criteria (the number of children or dependents in a family, the size of income).&#13;
Reform of the wage system in the budgetary sphere. Decisions in this area must&#13;
proceed from an analysis of the consequences of a strengthened financial base of the budgets&#13;
of the subjects (members) of the Federation through the redistribution of tax proceeds in&#13;
favor of the regions and targeted transfers from the federal budget; the granting of&#13;
discretionary rights to the regions to determine the levels of wages and salaries in the budget-&#13;
supported sphere with the Center determining only the minimum wage. A special study must&#13;
be made of the interconnection between all the minimum money allowances regulated at the&#13;
federal level and the minimum living standards.&#13;
Policy note. System of minimum social guarantees in tihe income sphere.&#13;
9.    Foreign Trade, Payment Balance. Movement of Capital and Foreign Debt&#13;
A very controversial situation has developed in Russia's foreign trade. The continuous&#13;
payment balance surplus in current transactions indicates that accumulation exceeds domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
investment in the Russian economy. The lack of positive changes in the aggregate domestic&#13;
demand and supply has a negative impact on the structure of foreign trade: the positive&#13;
balance is achieved almost totally through the export of fuel and raw materials. The policy&#13;
with regard to foreign loans aims at reducing borrowing switching to easy-term loans.&#13;
However, payments to service Russia's foreign debt continue to grow. The flight of capital&#13;
from Russia is still accompanied by an extremely small inflow of foreign investment.&#13;
Trade and payment balance. Factors affecting trade balance against the backdrop of&#13;
current decline and expected economic growth. A thorough analysis of how structural&#13;
adaptation affects exports and imports is needed. Different sectors have different effects on&#13;
trade balance. An assessment of changes in the structure of payment balance (an account of&#13;
current transactions, an account of transactions involving capital and financial instruments).&#13;
Trade policy and national interests. A serious problem that requires a close scrutiny&#13;
and balanced political decisions is the policy aimed at protecting Russian manufacturers from&#13;
imports, primarily in the automobile, pharmaceutical and food industries, where domestic&#13;
demand has been met largely due to imports. Protectionism, while causing prices to soar,&#13;
fails to stimulate supply of competitive domestic goods. In this regard, it is necessary to&#13;
conduct an empirical study of the effects of the development of import substituting industries&#13;
in Russia, including through foreign investment.&#13;
Another problem facing Russia's trade policy concerns exports* and is closely&#13;
interconnected with the tax system. The abolition of oil export tariffs has removed obstacles&#13;
to oil exports as the main source of currency revenues. However, it is important to find out&#13;
whether the excise tax on oil extraction, introduced in a bid to make up for the lack of&#13;
budget revenues, can lead to a decrease in oil extraction. It is also necessary to consider how&#13;
possible measures to improve the collection of taxes and ensure their timely transfer from&#13;
regions to the center may affect export,&#13;
Outflow of capital and ways to stop it. A return of capital taken out of the country&#13;
could become a significant source of investment resources. While making decisions in this&#13;
area it is necessary to study various options, such as an amnesty for all capital taken out of&#13;
the country, including "dirty' money, and a number of benefits for repatriated capital, except&#13;
'dirty' money. In working out measures to stop the "flight" of capital, it is necessary to try&#13;
to assess how efficiently authorized banks act as currency control agents and what effects the&#13;
solidary responsibility of banks for a failure to return currency may have, including as a&#13;
result of the export of currency earning goods.&#13;
Competitiveness in Russia as a recipient of capital. Available assessments indicate that&#13;
foreign investment cannot be considered at this point as a considerable potential source of&#13;
accumulation on the national scale because of the flaws in the country's legal system and&#13;
fierce competition on foreign capital markets. It would be expedient, therefore, to study the&#13;
role of foreign investment at the level of individual regions or industries, including by taking&#13;
into account the final decision on the procedure for using the law "On Production Sharing&#13;
Agreements."&#13;
The government is facing the need to create conditions that would allow Russia to&#13;
enter competition for markets and international investment. To this end, radical changes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I !&#13;
the tax system should be accompanied by a discussion on the effects of attempts to revise the&#13;
law on foreign investment, stop the practice of granting individual benefits to investors and&#13;
introduce a system of state and private investment insurance.&#13;
10.   Methods and Instruments of Economic and Statistical Analysis&#13;
A market economy requires a developed system of statistics covering all key economic&#13;
processes. In the course of its transition to market relations, Russia has confronted the need&#13;
to create a statistical base that would reflect the new economic conditions. The American&#13;
system of national financial accounts could provide one of the most vivid examples for&#13;
Russia. The bureau of economic analysis could take an active part in the development of such&#13;
a system in Russia.&#13;
The current system of statistics in Russia is generally characterized by poor quality.&#13;
In assessing Russia's methods of statistics, it is necessary to take into account, in addition&#13;
to the transitional nature of the economy, such specific factors as unfinished privatization,&#13;
the non-payment crisis, partial dollarization of payments, hidden types of debts of enterprises&#13;
and banks, the specific nature of the population's savings and the existence of a large-scale&#13;
shadow economy. As Russia proceeds with the privatization of enterprises and the creation&#13;
of an efficient financial system and develops more intricate economic ties, the use of national&#13;
financial accounts will be needed as a basis for a macroeconomic analysis and forecasts.&#13;
Prospects for the development of a system of sratistics. To study and reliably forecast&#13;
economic development one needs information about the sources, amount and forms of savings&#13;
of the population, non-financial enterprises, the financial sector and the government and data&#13;
on foreign economic payments. An analysis of the dynamics of revenues, assets and liabilities&#13;
of various economic agents and intersectoral flows of capital is also necessary to study the&#13;
key problems facing the Russian economy:&#13;
*     creation of a tax base in a long-term perspective;&#13;
*      formation of savings of enterprises and the population;&#13;
*     accumulation of financial means and their transformation into investment;&#13;
*      forecasts of interest rates and securities quotations; and&#13;
*      the "flight" of capital.&#13;
It is also necessary to take into account the real difficulties that one comes across&#13;
during the collectiun and processing of statistical data in the transition period. These&#13;
difficulties are particularly evident when one tries to draw a watershed among various sectors&#13;
of the economy. It would be expedient to find out the legitimacy of an approach that divides&#13;
the public sector into federal and regional levels. The non-financial sector includes public and&#13;
private enterprises; the financial sector banking and other financial institutions. Small&#13;
businesses are part of the structure of the population's assets. It is also necessary to discuss&#13;
ways of reflecting inflationary effects and money surrogates in statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
The bureau of economic analysis could launch a pilot project to study the flow of&#13;
capital in the Russian economy. Such a project could determine sectors and principal market&#13;
instruments, make a primary assessment of the structure of the economy and ai.nual flows&#13;
in various sectors. The project could be carried out by the statistics group of the bureau of&#13;
economic analysis in conjunction with Central Bank and Goskomstat representatives in the&#13;
bureau.&#13;

Supplement&#13;
LIST OF POLICY PAPERS TO BE PREPARED IN YEAR ONE&#13;
1.    Macroeconomic, Monetary and Credit Policy&#13;
Scenarios of macroeconomic policy in the mid-term perspective&#13;
Being investigated is one of the most pressing current problems -- the issuance of&#13;
money surrogates that do not lend themselves to government control and whose total volume&#13;
has substantially exceeded the amount of money in circulation. Analysis of the negative&#13;
consequences of the dissemination of surrogates in terms of the effectiveness of&#13;
macroeconomic policy. Study of conditions capable of preventing a further issuance of&#13;
surrogates. Study of mid-term scenarios of the development of the economy which are largely&#13;
determined by the restructuring and partial monetization of accumulated money surrogates.&#13;
Prospects of the dc-dollarization of the Russian economy are also assessed. This theme&#13;
presupposes a study and adaptation of international experience for the purpose of perfecting&#13;
models of macroeconomic forecasting.&#13;
Instruments of macroeconomic policy&#13;
The study centers on methods of transition from macrostabilization to economic&#13;
growth and growth of investments. Substantiation of the choice of concept of economic&#13;
policy: to be based on smoothing out the cycles of economic activity or on high rates of&#13;
economic growth  in  the  long-term, perspective. Study of alternative variants  of&#13;
macroeconomic policy that express themselves in a substantial level of taxation, or, on the&#13;
contrary, of borrowing; the most likely impact of these variants on economic growth. An&#13;
analysis of monetary policy will make it possible to study the main instruments from the&#13;
viewpoint of flexibility and effectiveness when dampening the consequences of possible&#13;
shocks in the monetary system. Such issues as the policv of debt-servicing, pattern of&#13;
spending and the extensive use of tax exemptions are studied in the context of budget policy.&#13;
2.    Tax and Budget Policy. Regional Transfers. FLnancing of the Social Sphere.&#13;
Diagnosing the tax crisis and the principles of tax reform in the aspect of economic&#13;
growth&#13;
The low coilectibility of taxes requires, first of all, an analysis of both the objective&#13;
and subjective causes of this situation. It is necessary to study the structure of current tax&#13;
payments on the basis of information provided by the State Tax Service, the Federal&#13;
Treasury and the State Customs Committee. Evaluation of the consequences of changes in&#13;
the tax legislation that occurred in the course of the financial year. Elaboration of a model&#13;
to forecast tax revenue. The study is based on the existing macroeconomic model of assessing&#13;
taxes with a subsequent transition to a more advanced multi-sectoral model. Analysis of&#13;
quantitative evaluations of changes in tax legislation, in particular, the corresponding articles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
of the Tax Code. International experience and possibilities of perfecting the Russian tax&#13;
system.&#13;
3.    Support for Entrepreneurship. Anti-Monopoly Policy, Natural Monopolies&#13;
Barriers to access and transactional costs. (Ensuring conditionsforfair competition)&#13;
Analysis of existing barriers in Russia to the entry of a sector by new enterprises. The&#13;
extent to which remaining giant enterprises can economize on the scale of production. Is it&#13;
really so that in Russia we are observing a classic variant of negative saving on scale --&#13;
growth of long-term average costs as output increases because of the high level of&#13;
management expenses. Evaluation of the forming of vertically integrated oil companies from&#13;
the viewpoint of mergers that create an obstacle to entry into the sector. Methods of control&#13;
over key types of raw materials and state-of-the-art technologies. Analysis of ensuring&#13;
conditions for fair competition: down-sizing enterprises and support for small businesses.&#13;
Organized markets as a means of making information available and reducing transactional&#13;
costs as transactions are performed and new enterprises set up.&#13;
4.    Industrial Policy, Savings and Investments. Economic Growth&#13;
Volume and sources of national accumulation&#13;
Analysis of the consequences for the process of accumulation resultant of the&#13;
transformation of the structure of ownership in the course of transition to the market. A&#13;
special study is made of the problem of interconnection of the volume and sources of&#13;
accumulation with, firstly, the development of various sectors of the economy and, secondly,&#13;
the performance of enterprises in the post-privatization period. Summing up of international&#13;
experience from the viewpoint of traditional sources of accumulation. Analysis of potential&#13;
sources of accumulation in the Russian economy -- amortization, profits of enterprises and&#13;
savings of the population. Study of the question of how to increase the share of amortization&#13;
payments in the overall volume of accumulation. In the course of the study it is necessary&#13;
to determine the extent to which preconditions for raising the norm and real volume of the&#13;
population's savings can be utilized.&#13;
6.    Reform of Enterprises, Corporative Management. Restructuring of Production&#13;
Management of state enterprises and state property&#13;
Analysis of the problem of managing state enterprises. This requires defining&#13;
strategically important sectors in terms of national interests. Concept of the system of&#13;
managing enterprises in strategic sectors. Study of the question of the technique of privatizing&#13;
such enterprises on the basis of a specially elaborated scheme.&#13;
Study of the problem of managing state property connected with the management of&#13;
government-owned packages of shares. Criteria for selecting enterprises when a part of their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
shares are to remain in the hands of government bodies. This includes, in particular, the&#13;
shares of strategic enterprises since this ensures the economic interests of the state. A special&#13;
mechanism should be created to manage the packages of such shares, but this requires an&#13;
additional investigation. Analysis of the question of the efficacy of the existing and&#13;
alternative ways of selling government-owned shares.&#13;
7.    Financial System. Financial Institutes and Markets&#13;
Relative size and structure of the financial system&#13;
Diagnosis of the current state of the system, correlation of assets in different&#13;
segments. The place and role of the banking sector. Ratio of bank assets to GDP. Assessment&#13;
of the economy's requirements in the development of new financial institutes -- pension and&#13;
insurance companies, investment funds. Relation of M-2 to the total volume of money&#13;
supply. Analysis of the problem of adequacy of capital to the economy's requirements. Study&#13;
of the financial system from the viewpoint of distributing the mobilized resources with the&#13;
aim of ensuring economic growth. Assessment of the possibilities of financial institutes to&#13;
solve the task of attracting money of the population. One of the key aspects of the study --&#13;
how to utilize the population's savings to finance the economy.&#13;
8.    Incomes, Employment, Poverty&#13;
Poverty and social aid programs&#13;
Concept and overall scale of poverty in Russia. Dynamics of poverty, the share of the&#13;
poor among the entire Russian population. Study of the interconnection of poverty and the&#13;
sharp differentiation of the population's incomes. Forms of manifestation of relative and&#13;
absolute poverty in Russia. Level of poverty from the viewpoint of regional dispersion.&#13;
Analysis of the question of how long a poor person remains poor in Russia. 'Invisible" poor,&#13;
poverty and unemployment. The extent to which poverty influences the increase in the&#13;
number of refugees. Directions of the reform of social security. Criteria of identifying the&#13;
main recipients of assistance. Evaluation of psychological risk connected with the&#13;
implementation of aid programs.&#13;
9.    Foreign Trade, Balance of Payrnents. Movement of Capital and External Debt&#13;
Russia's comparative advantages on the world comrnodity mark-ets&#13;
Study of the question to what extent and in what areas Russia's comparative&#13;
advantages are due to specialization. In particular, should rich natural resources, fertile lands,&#13;
comparatively cheap labor in the absence of state-of-the-art technologies be regarded as the&#13;
basis for specialization in the output of raw-material commodities and agricultural produce.&#13;
Analysis of real production cost in the fuel and energy sector from the viewpoint of ensuring&#13;
Russia's comparative advantages. Can a deepening of specialization within a sector help&#13;
Russia's consolidation on the markets of hi-tech products (space, aviation and laser&#13;
hardware). Measures needed to give Russia access to new foreign markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
10.   Methods and Instruments of Economic and Statistical Analysis&#13;
Methodology and main directions in thle development of macroeconomic statistics&#13;
in Russia&#13;
Analysis of financial flows between sectors of the economy as a basis for working out&#13;
decisions in the area of macroeconomic policy. Assessment of changes in the financial assets&#13;
and liabilities of various agents of the economy from the standpoint of choice of the most&#13;
effective decisions. The system of national accounts (SNA), that is forming in Russia, is the&#13;
key instrument for analyzing macroeconomic indicators. One of the main tasks confronting&#13;
Russian statistics is to do away with the internal contradictions between indicators. In this&#13;
connection it is important to determine the extent to which the forming of SNA influences&#13;
the completion of work to regularly draw up inter-sectoral balances, the transition to the&#13;
working out of the financial account and the account of the financial sector. The solution of&#13;
this task requires special efforts to determine and integrate the necessary data that is now in&#13;
the possession of diverse agencies (Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Ministry of&#13;
Finance, State Committee for Statistics).&#13;

EXTERNAL OUTREACH PROGRAM&#13;
l.    The Bank and BEA discussed the following model for the External Outreach program, which&#13;
would be modeled on KDI's International Development Exchange Program, which has been critical to&#13;
KDI's increasingly important role in promoting international economic cooperation. The purpose of&#13;
the External Outreach Program will be to further cooperation within Russia and internationally on&#13;
economic policy issues in the BEA's work program. The Scientific Secretary will lead this effort, and&#13;
he/she will be responsible for developing relations and ensuring coordination with various external&#13;
bodies in order to meet the following objectives:&#13;

APPENDIX 14&#13;
EVALUATION POLICY&#13;
BEA Operations&#13;
1.    Measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness of Bureau operations will be required for: (i)&#13;
accountability to BEA directors and sponsors and (ii) improvement in BEA policies, procedures and&#13;
capacities.&#13;
2.     The Operations Manual details the procedures for an annual assessment to be performed by the&#13;
Bureau for independent review by the Academic Council or a Committee of the Board of Trustees (such&#13;
as an audit committee). The Council or Committee would submit the report and its comments to the&#13;
Bank and to the Boards of Directors and Trustess for review during the latter's annual meeting.&#13;
3.     The report will measure and assess:&#13;
a.     adherence to BEA budgetary and financial policies, including local cost contributions&#13;
(includes sources and uses of funds)&#13;
b.     efficiency and effectiveness of assignment planning (process by which teams are&#13;
assembled to complete a given policy study or report)&#13;
c.     qualifications and selection process of staff, consultants and ministerial secondments&#13;
d.    implementation of annual training plan for BEA and ministerial staff; and&#13;
e.     external communications (frequency and nature of contact with Russian and international&#13;
organizations).&#13;
4.     Data sources would include: (a) aggregated annual project results; (b) BEA budget outlays; (c)&#13;
third-party evaluations, including from training institutions.&#13;
Impact of Policy Studies&#13;
5.     Annually, the Academic Council will undertake an internal review of BEA outputs that will be&#13;
provided to the Board of Trustees and the Bank. The intention would be to evaluate: (i) the relevance&#13;
of the study's objectives to priority requirements in the national economic agenda; (ii) the quality of the&#13;
analysis, particularly in the use and interpretation of data and the realism (in terms of implementation)&#13;
of the policy options proposed; and (iii) the impact, if any, on the course of the national policy debate.&#13;
Impact evaluations of this nature are difficult to measure quantitatively and must rely on multiple&#13;
reviewers whose analyses can be compared. To assist the Bureau in achieving its impact objectives, the&#13;
Bank would finance an independent evaluation of BEA outputs every two years as part of Bank&#13;
supervision activities.&#13;

            The principal development objective of
            the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Project is to build
            institutional capacity for sound economic analysis in
            support of market-oriented structural reforms. To meet this
            objective, the project has three sub-goals: (1) to increase
            the quantity and quality of cross-sectoral economic policy
            studies for government use; (2) to establish the BEA outside
            of but accountable to government, for an objective,
            economy-wide perspective in assessing economic policy
            options, and (3) to improve the reliability of the national
            accounts as a basis for sound economic analysis. The project
            will finance three components: (1) Policy studies- for local
            and international consultants, and to obtain data to use in
            medium-term policy studies focused on macroeconomic analysis
            and public finance, social policy, and enterprise economics
            and financial sector reform; for production of the annual
            report, quarterly indicators, and quick-response policy
            notes, and for databases to support these initiatives; (2)
            Bureau of Economic Analysis- for the technical and human
            resources needed to increase capacity for economic policy
            analysis both in the BEA and in the core economic
            ministries, including computer and information technology, a
            library, on-line databases, and training, study tours, and
            fellowships; and (3) Improvement of national accounts- for
            computer equipment, training, and technical assistance
            needed to improve the quality of economic statistics.
