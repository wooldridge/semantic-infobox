       This report is based on site reports and country data summaries prepared by field research teams in&#13;
&#13;
Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Both the contents and presentation of this report benefited substantially from detailed&#13;
&#13;
and incisive comments received from peer reviewers Caroline van den Berg and Richard Pollard. Research&#13;
&#13;
teams in Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia reviewed drafts and provided valuable feedback and photographs&#13;
&#13;
from fieldwork. Clara Mutter and Dewi Herlina patiently and painstakingly prepared and assembled chapters&#13;
&#13;
into the final document. Any shortcomings remaining however, are fully attributable to the author.&#13;

Why a Multi-Country Study of Sanitation&#13;

Rural sanitation projects have, by and large, not enjoyed&#13;

&#13;

however, of whatdoes work for rural sanitation, and why.&#13;
&#13;
What makes services sustainable and what leads to their&#13;
&#13;
effective use by all? This multi-country study therefore set&#13;
&#13;
out to find communities where sanitation interventions&#13;
&#13;
have been relatively more successful and learn from&#13;
&#13;
them what contributed to the success.&#13;

Policy formulation efforts are under way in Cambodia,&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia and Vietnam, in the sanitation and water&#13;

* - Sanitation interventions had been made in many of the Indonesian communities from more than one source during the course of the past&#13;
20 years. It was difficult to fully isolate the impact of the different projects. The study focused on the current sanitation situation which was&#13;
most influenced by: a) the last project intervention and b) the communities' own initiatives after the last project.&#13;

        ** - In 7 out of 12 communities in Vietnam 38 ­ 65% of all latrines were open pit / dug holes, not considered as sanitary&#13;
             toilets. Bracketed figures show access to all types of latrines, both sanitary and unsanitary. Elsewhere "access" means&#13;

community behavior from using dry pit latrines to flush latrines, and a reduction in the use of water bodies or orange groves as&#13;

The research teams used a common checklist to observe&#13;
&#13;
a randomly selected number of household latrines in both&#13;
&#13;
poor and better-off parts of communities in the three&#13;
&#13;
countries. A total of 140 latrines were observed in&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia, 95 in Cambodia and 110 in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Average use and maintenance scores for latrines&#13;
observed in Cambodia and Indonesia (pour-flush type&#13;
&#13;
mostly) were between 72 ­ 83 per cent of a maximum of&#13;

    i .e. totally self financed, were better maintained and&#13;

    of higher quality as compared to project-provided&#13;

    ones. These were more likely to be the latrines of&#13;

&#13;
A review of factors stimulating or hindering demand for&#13;
&#13;
sanitation facilities in the 3 countries provides evidence&#13;
&#13;
why sanitation facilities need to be seen and managed&#13;
&#13;
as consumer goods, if the goals of universal access,&#13;

effective use and community health improvement are to&#13;
&#13;
be realized.&#13;

&#13;
As Figure 3a clarifies, there are also country ­ specific&#13;
&#13;
factors that push up demand for household latrines.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of land within or around homes was an&#13;
&#13;
important factor in Indonesia where the study villages&#13;
&#13;
were larger and more crowded than elsewhere. In&#13;
&#13;
Vietnam a very strong demand ­ promoting influence was&#13;
&#13;
sanitation promotion by local governments and village&#13;
&#13;
development boards, which along with local medical            Crowded villages may have demand for household latrines&#13;
authorities conducted community campaigns for cleaner         but no land to site them on.&#13;
&#13;
villages and generated peer pressure on families to&#13;
&#13;
conform by building household toilets.                        in Cambodia the study communities had fewer supply&#13;
&#13;
                                                              options than elsewhere and got their latrines mainly&#13;
&#13;
"Project assistance" was mentioned as a factor in             through projects. Local sanitation promotion was also not&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia and Vietnam, but not in Cambodia. Interestingly,    mentioned as a demand-stimulating factor in Cambodia.&#13;

The match between local practices related to disposal&#13;
&#13;
or use of human excreta and the sanitation technology or&#13;
                                                                  In Cambodia the rural laborer's daily wage in&#13;

stimulator of demand for household latrines in Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
and to a lesser extent in Cambodia. The night soil is used        to pay the 30,000 ­ 40,000 Riels in cash which&#13;
&#13;
directly as fertilizer for local agriculture. This has led to     is the amount currently required as the user's share&#13;

for traditional practices of defecation in the open                  able to adjust payments rules for the poorest, by&#13;
and (b) poor people's lack of resources for investing                spreading them over several months or even several&#13;
in latrines. The study looked at the problem through the             harvest seasons. Family groups in several Indonesian&#13;
eyes of user communities and found some surprising                   villages initiated community level savings and credit&#13;

5. Impact of Hygiene Awareness and Practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community health improvements do not result from the&#13;
&#13;
existence of sanitation facilities. People's use of water&#13;
&#13;
and sanitation facilities in ways that promote health is&#13;
&#13;
the critical issue. The study examined community beliefs&#13;
&#13;
and practices related to cleanliness and hygiene, using&#13;
&#13;
participatory diagramming (PHAST) methods separately&#13;
&#13;
with men and women's groups. The results showed some&#13;
&#13;
patterns common to all 3 country situations. Some&#13;
&#13;
area-specific hazardous practices also come to light.&#13;

Many others simply discarded the project - given cement&#13;
&#13;
pans without building the pour-flush toilet, or installed the&#13;
&#13;
pan on the pit but never built enclosures around it and&#13;

&#13;
cement glazes over cement pans to make them smoother&#13;

and tinted the white glaze blue or pink to have a choice&#13;

            Achieving sustained sanitation for the poor

        <abstracts>
            Rural sanitation projects have, by and
            large, not enjoyed high levels of success in developing
            countries. Many lessons have been learned about what does
            not work, from the numerous broken down, unused or discarded
            "improved" latrines dotting the rural landscape
            and the still high mortality and morbidity from water and
            sanitation related diseases. There is little known
            documented evidence however, of what does work for rural
            sanitation, and why. What makes services sustainable and
            what leads to their effective use by all? This multi-country
            study therefore set out to find communities where sanitation
            interventions have been relatively more successful and learn
            from them what contributed to the success. Policy
            formulation efforts are under way in Cambodia, Indonesia and
            Vietnam, in the sanitation and water supply sector. The aim
            was to feed into this effort by investigating how positive
            outcomes such as high sanitation coverage came about in the
            selected communities in each country and what influencing
            factors helped or hindered those outcomes. The consultations
            also explored to what extent community hygiene behaviors had
            changed towards more health protecting practices, and what
            actually sustains access of the poor to sanitation, over the long-term.
