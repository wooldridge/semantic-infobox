                               Mr. James T. Movick&#13;
                          Director general of the Paciï¬&#129;c Islands&#13;

&#13;
This report provides a refreshingly new analysis of foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangements,&#13;
which are prevalent in approximately half of the national exclusive economic zones&#13;
of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s oceans. Fisheries access arrangements have often been demonized as a&#13;
license for the ï¬&#130;eets of developed nations to â&#128;&#156;rip oï¬&#128;â&#128;&#157; ï¬&#129;sheries resources of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
poorer countries. This report illustrates how theyâ&#128;&#148;together with charters and joint&#13;
venturesâ&#128;&#148;can actually be regarded as a trade in services. As with other trade, the&#13;
principles of comparative advantage apply and can, under the right circumstances,&#13;
beneï¬&#129;t all parties.&#13;

As the Paciï¬&#129;c Island countries of our region provide material for two of the eight&#13;
case studies (and New Zealand, a member of our organization, provides material for&#13;
a third), I would like to reiterate brieï¬&#130;y the lessons that we have learned. As a group&#13;
of newly independent nations, including the smallest in the world, our members were&#13;
quick to recognize the need to work togetherâ&#128;&#148;at ï¬&#129;rst simply to assert their rights over&#13;
the large areas of ocean that became their EEZs, and then to put in place systems for&#13;
uniform and cooperative monitoring, control, and surveillance. The Paciï¬&#129;c Islands&#13;
Forum Fisheries Agency was established by those governments in 1979 to strengthen&#13;
their national eï¬&#128;orts and to coordinate their collective and cooperative eï¬&#128;orts. Over&#13;
time we have been able to develop systems that have increased the value of access to&#13;
the resource, providing greater revenue for those who wish to grant access and greater&#13;
leverage for those that use it to induce foreign investment in domestic industry and&#13;
processing. This has been achieved in a complex shared ï¬&#129;shery for highly migratory&#13;
species extending over a huge area.&#13;
&#13;
It has not been easy. As contributor Les Clark notes, â&#128;&#156;itâ&#128;&#153;s a long haulâ&#128;&#157; and we have&#13;
much more to do; but as he also says, â&#128;&#156;cooperation works.â&#128;&#157; I realize that every region&#13;
is diï¬&#128;erent and not all of what we have learned will be applicable elsewhere, but the&#13;
Forum Fisheries Agency stands ready to share our experience through South-South&#13;
cooperation.&#13;

&#13;
The ï¬&#129;sheries sector has become one of the most globalized of all food commodity sec-&#13;
tors with about one third of production entering international markets. The increasing&#13;
internationalization of its supply and value-chains has given policymakers the task&#13;
of rising to new challenges concerning harvesters, aquaculture producers, processors,&#13;
traders, distributers, and retailers. Consumers are also exposed to and subject to the&#13;
impacts of global trends as supply chains get longer and growing urbanization and&#13;
improved distribution increase the range of products available.&#13;
&#13;
In the international debate on ï¬&#129;sheries issues, the impact of globalization has there-&#13;
fore ï¬&#129;rmly come to the forefront. This includes a focus on how globalization manifests&#13;
itself throughout the value-chain and the eï¬&#128;ect on various stakeholder groups as well&#13;
as how policy decisions at the national, regional, and international level are inï¬&#130;uenced&#13;
by global factors. In the debate, however, there is one issue that clearly has not received&#13;
the attention it deserves from an analytical perspective, and that is the issue of ï¬&#129;sh-&#13;
ing services the services oï¬&#128;ered in bunkering and other activities in ports, as well as&#13;
in monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS), research, harvesting, and processing.&#13;
&#13;
Fishing services are already part of many bilateral and multilateral ï¬&#129;shing agreements,&#13;
but the topic ï¬&#129;gures only sporadically in policy discussions and even more rarely in&#13;
economic analysis, despite the potential for these services to generate value and eco-&#13;
nomic beneï¬&#129;ts. This report is therefore all the more valuable as it provides in-depth&#13;
knowledge and experience to policymakers as much through its discussion of the con-&#13;
ceptual framework of ï¬&#129;shing services as through the various case studies undertaken.&#13;
Moreover, the case studies have provided critical practical caveats and important gov-&#13;
ernance lessons, not the least of which is that the development of secure user rights sys-&#13;
tems is essential for ï¬&#129;sh resources to deliver their full contribution to economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which celebrates its 20th anni-&#13;
versary in 2015, clearly recognizes that each country will seek solutions that best ï¬&#129;t its&#13;
own circumstances. In doing so, policymakers will build on the principles of the Code,&#13;
binding international commitments, voluntary instruments, the best scientiï¬&#129;c advice,&#13;
and the experience of others. In this sense, the report Trade in Fishing Servicesâ&#128;&#148;Emerging&#13;
Perspectives on Foreign Fishing Arrangements, is a timely addition to our knowledge and&#13;
eï¬&#128;orts to ensure that our ï¬&#129;sheries resources will deliver secure optimal, equitable, and&#13;
sustainable returns for economic growth, improved social welfare, and development.&#13;

In memory of Professor William T. Burke, 1926â&#128;&#147;2014, whose legal research and writ-&#13;
ings had a profound inï¬&#130;uence on the report.&#13;
&#13;
This report is the culmination of a global analytic and empirical study commissioned&#13;
by the World Bank, which set out to improve understanding of the arrangements for,&#13;
and outcomes of, allowing foreign access to the ï¬&#129;sh resources of coastal states, particu-&#13;
larly developing countries. The report argues that the various forms of access arrange-&#13;
ments are, in fact, mechanisms for international trade in ï¬&#129;shing services. Within this&#13;
'TIFS' context, the authors present detailed economic, legal, and empirical analyses&#13;
which provide powerful new insights on how such arrangements can increase the eco-&#13;
nomic, social, and environmental beneï¬&#129;ts derived by developing-country (and other)&#13;
coastal states from their valuable ï¬&#129;sh resources. In particular, the study highlights&#13;
concern over the current interpretation of the so-called â&#128;&#152;surplusâ&#128;&#153; principle within&#13;
UNCLOS, and emphasizes comparative advantage as a key determinant of increased&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
The overall review was coordinated by Stephen Cunningham (IDDRA Ltd.), a spe-&#13;
cialist in ï¬&#129;sheries economics with wide-ranging international-development experience&#13;
in ï¬&#129;sheries.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Approximately half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s economic exclusion zones (EEZs) are subject to&#13;
some form of foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangement (FFA). Although the discourse on such&#13;
arrangements has been heavily inï¬&#130;uenced by government-to-government â&#128;&#156;foreign&#13;
ï¬&#129;sheries access agreements,â&#128;&#157; it is important to set the discussion within a wider con-&#13;
text, which includes joint ventures between coastal-state and distant-water interests&#13;
and chartering of foreign ï¬&#129;shing vessels by coastal state interests.&#13;
&#13;
Such arrangements represent mechanisms to allow international trade in ï¬&#129;shing ser-&#13;
vices (TIFS), oï¬&#128;ering the possibility for coastal states, especially developing countries,&#13;
to increase the beneï¬&#129;ts from the exploitation of their ï¬&#129;sh resources.&#13;
&#13;
This report presents an analytic review of economic and legal principles supported by&#13;
empirical casework to elucidate actual and potential cost and beneï¬&#129;t ï¬&#130;ows associated&#13;
with FFAs.&#13;
&#13;
The proposition that social welfare depends on sustained economic growth is well&#13;
established both theoretically and empirically. Increasing gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) per capita is of interest not just for its own sake but because it is very strongly&#13;
associated with increases in the Human Development Index (HDI), particularly for&#13;
low levels of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
Marine ï¬&#129;sh resources represent valuable natural capital that, if managed carefully and&#13;
sustainably, have the potential to make a perennial contribution to economic growth&#13;
through the resource rents that they can generate.&#13;
&#13;
The general proposition that trade is an important driver of economic growth is also&#13;
well established. However, in the case of ï¬&#129;sheries, it is the importance of trade in ï¬&#129;sh&#13;
and ï¬&#129;sh products that has dominated the policy agenda. Yet there is no a priori rea-&#13;
son to believe that trade in services will be less important than trade in goods in the&#13;
case of ï¬&#129;shing. In fact, as the trend away from free and open access to ï¬&#129;sh resources&#13;
toward access regimes based around use and property rights of diï¬&#128;erent kinds takes&#13;
hold, there is every reason to believe that there will be increasing interest in generating&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;further beneï¬&#129;ts from ï¬&#129;sh resources through international           In the absence of any legal requirement to enter into such&#13;
trade in ï¬&#129;shing services of all kinds, in particular harvest-      arrangements, coastal states will do so only if they per-&#13;
ing and processing services.                                       ceive it to be in their economic interests. If foreign ï¬&#129;shers&#13;
                                                                   have a comparative advantage, it can beneï¬&#129;t coastal states&#13;
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea                to import their services. Such a comparative advantage&#13;
(UNCLOS), also called the Law of the Sea Convention                could arise for many reasons throughout the ï¬&#129;sh value&#13;
or the Law of the Sea treaty, is the international agree-          chain. For instance, foreigners may have comparative&#13;
ment that resulted from the third United Nations Con-              advantage in the following operations:&#13;
ference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which                       Â» Fishing, due to skill or access to capital enabling&#13;
took place between 1973 and 1982. The UNCLOS                               them to operate more eï¬&#131;ciently in capital-intensive&#13;
raises a number of issues relating to trade in ï¬&#129;shing                      ï¬&#129;sheries;&#13;
services. A key question concerns the so-called surplus                 Â» Processing, due to the scale of operations; and&#13;
principle: If the coastal state has surplus ï¬&#129;sh resources,              Â» Marketing, due to market access, proximity to&#13;
is it obliged to grant access to other states, including                   customers, and product branding.&#13;
distant water ï¬&#129;shing states, albeit subject to conditions?&#13;
This report concludes that there is no such requirement.           Comparative advantage does not depend only on the rela-&#13;
The power of the coastal state to set the allowable catch          tive eï¬&#131;ciency of the ï¬&#129;shing industry of the coastal state&#13;
is â&#128;&#156;sovereign and non-reviewable,â&#128;&#157; and the coastal state           compared with distant water ï¬&#129;shers. Comparative advan-&#13;
is authorized to determine its own harvesting capacity in          tage may also arise because the coastal state has other&#13;
relation to the living resources of its EEZ. Consequently,         proï¬&#129;table sectors that can make better use of its capital&#13;
a rational coastal state will only declare a surplus if it is in   and labor resources than can the ï¬&#129;shing industry, or the&#13;
its interest to do so. It is not clear, however, whether this      distant water nation may have few other opportunities&#13;
crucial conclusion is widely understood. Indeed, it could          and may be prepared to ï¬&#129;sh at very low cost. There is a&#13;
be conjectured that some developing-country states                 need to promote understanding of comparative advan-&#13;
may have established foreign-ï¬&#129;shing access agreements              tage with respect to ï¬&#129;shery policy development.&#13;
under the misapprehension that this was a requirement&#13;
of UNCLOS.                                                         Comparative advantage will determine the gains that are&#13;
                                                                   available from trade. These gains will be shared between&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER ONE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Approximately half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are subject to some&#13;
form of foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangement (FFA). Such arrangements are primarily estab-&#13;
lished for export2 but can also be important for local and regional markets. While the&#13;
discourse on such arrangements has been dominated by government-to-government&#13;
foreign ï¬&#129;sheries access agreements, it is important to set the discussion within a wider&#13;
context that includes joint ventures and chartering of foreign ï¬&#129;shing vessels by coastal&#13;
state interests. FFAs also concern a variety of resources and resource management&#13;
situations, including&#13;
     Â» National ï¬&#129;sh resources located entirely within one countryâ&#128;&#153;s EEZ;&#13;
     Â» Fish resources that straddle the EEZ of two or more countries;&#13;
     Â» Fish resources that straddle EEZ and areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ);&#13;
        and&#13;
     Â» In some cases, resources that are caught in ABNJ.&#13;
&#13;
FFAs often provide access to the ï¬&#129;sh resources of developing countries for so-called&#13;
distant water ï¬&#130;eets (DWFs) from developed and middle-income countries. Some types&#13;
of FFAs, particularly access agreements, can account for 50 percent of public rev-&#13;
enues in some African and small-island countries. However, although FFAs oï¬&#128;er the&#13;
possibility for coastal states, especially developing countries, to increase the beneï¬&#129;ts&#13;
they obtain from the exploitation of their ï¬&#129;sh resources, the context within which&#13;
they are negotiated and the institutional arrangements under which they are executed&#13;
may be prejudicial to long-term resource sustainability and optimal utilization. Thus,&#13;
key questions might include the following: Under what conditions is it best for coastal&#13;
states to use foreign ï¬&#129;shing services? How can coastal states ensure that they optimize&#13;
the beneï¬&#129;ts on a sustainable basis?&#13;
&#13;
Despite the substantial beneï¬&#129;ts potentially available both to coastal states and distant&#13;
water ï¬&#129;shing ï¬&#130;eets, FFAs have tended to suï¬&#128;er from a negative reputation associ-&#13;
ated with factors such as poor transparency, inequitable beneï¬&#129;t sharing, conï¬&#130;ict with&#13;

APPROACH AND STRUCTURE&#13;
OF THE REPORT&#13;
The approach adopted by the study was to develop an analytical review of the legal&#13;
and economic principles underpinning trade in ï¬&#129;sh harvesting and processing services.&#13;
This review was supported by empirical casework to elucidate actual and potential&#13;
beneï¬&#129;ts and costs associated with such services. The study focused on marine ï¬&#129;sh&#13;
stocks, but many of the issues are likely to be relevant to ï¬&#129;sh stocks from large inland&#13;
water bodies, such as the Great Lakes of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The report is presented in two parts. The ï¬&#129;rst (chapters 1 to 9) discusses and synthe-&#13;
sizes the study ï¬&#129;ndings and presents a set of recommendations for further action,&#13;
whereas the second part comprises a set of nine contributing appendices.&#13;
&#13;
Appendix A (Gordon Munro) comprises a detailed legal and economic review and&#13;
analysis of the background to FFAs. Legal aspects focus on the UN Convention on the&#13;
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) framework concerning access to coastal-state ï¬&#129;sh resources&#13;
by distant-water ï¬&#129;shing ï¬&#130;eets. The economic principles important to a coastal stateâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
decision to use, or not use, foreign harvesting services are then discussed in detail. The&#13;
following speciï¬&#129;c issues are considered in some detail:&#13;
     Â» The key area of comparative advantage;&#13;
     Â» The crucial role of coastal state governance arrangements; that is, the need for&#13;
       a rational set of exploitation arrangements within which FFAs can ï¬&#129;t;&#13;
     Â» The basis on which FFAs are negotiated and agreed to;&#13;
     Â» Dealing with asymmetric bargaining power;&#13;
     Â» Dealing with principal-agent problems;&#13;
     Â» The need for MCS capability in order to assert genuine sovereignty over EEZs;&#13;
       and&#13;
     Â» The transition process away from FFAs with changing comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
Appendices B through I comprise a set of case studies commissioned from a range of&#13;
authors with detailed knowledge of the subject (see table 2.1) to investigate diï¬&#128;erent&#13;
aspects of trade in ï¬&#129;shing services around the world. The case studies were chosen&#13;

and the international community in general. Two questions caused particular concern.&#13;
&#13;
First, where the total allowable catch in the coastal state exceeds its harvesting capac-&#13;
ity, that is, where a surplus exists, is the coastal state obliged to grant access to other&#13;
states, including distant water ï¬&#129;shing states, albeit subject to conditions (the so-called&#13;
surplus principle)? In this regard, Munro (appendix A), following Burke (1983, 1994),7&#13;
argues forcefully that the relevant articles of UNCLOS (62 in particular) are in fact&#13;
empty because the coastal state alone determines the total allowable catch (TAC) or&#13;
equivalent and determines its own harvesting capacity.8 Therefore, the coastal state&#13;
alone determines whether there is a surplus. There is no requirement for the coastal&#13;
state to prove to the international community that a surplus does or does not exist.&#13;
&#13;
Second, does the coastal state have a responsibility to manage the resource in an opti-&#13;
mum manner, in the sense of maximum sustainable yield (MSY)? UNCLOS may&#13;
also appear open to an interpretation here. In practice there is no such requirement&#13;
because the relevant article (Article 61.3) states that the implementation of MSY may&#13;
be â&#128;&#156;qualiï¬&#129;ed by relevant environmental and economic factors.â&#128;&#157; As a result, the coastal&#13;
state is under no obligation to observe or maintain a particular level of utilization&#13;
above zero from a particular ï¬&#129;shery.&#13;
&#13;
In summary, the power of the coastal state to set the allowable catch is â&#128;&#156;sovereign and&#13;
non-reviewableâ&#128;&#157; and the coastal state is authorized to determine its own harvesting&#13;
capacity in relation to the living resources of its EEZ. As Munro stresses in appendix A&#13;
â&#128;&#156;it cannot be overemphasized that the coastal state is called upon to give away nothing&#13;
for free.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&amp;#12;Putting these various points together, it is clear that a        responsibility, the latter seems to go beyond its remit as&#13;
rational coastal state will only declare a surplus if it is in   established by UNCLOS. In any event, the EU Parliament&#13;
its interest to do so.                                           may deï¬&#129;ne sustainability requirements that it wishes to see&#13;

It is not clear, however, that this crucial conclusion is        from UNCLOS. Distant-water states do not have respon-&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER FOUR&#13;
ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES&#13;
Taking the position that there is no requirement for a coastal state to use foreign ï¬&#129;shing&#13;
services (harvesting or processing), Munro (appendix A) sets out the economic argu-&#13;
ments that may justify their use.&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding the discussion above, UNCLOS (Article 62[1]) does provide a useful&#13;
starting point for the discussion because it requires coastal states to â&#128;&#156;promote the objec-&#13;
tive of optimum utilization of the living resources within the EEZ.â&#128;&#157; Unfortunately,&#13;
analytical progress can only be made if the term optimum is deï¬&#129;ned, and this term can&#13;
be and is interpreted diï¬&#128;erently by diï¬&#128;erent people, depending in large part on how&#13;
they perceive the beneï¬&#129;ts of ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation. The issue of â&#128;&#156;beneï¬&#129;tsâ&#128;&#157; and&#13;
their interpretation is discussed fully in section 6 below.&#13;
&#13;
For the purpose of economic analysis, it is assumed that ï¬&#129;sh resources are the property&#13;
in some sense of all citizens of the coastal state and that optimum utilization involves&#13;
ensuring that this natural capital makes the maximum contribution to the state as a&#13;
whole through time. Many national ï¬&#129;sheries laws include an article establishing pre-&#13;
cisely such ownership and identifying the state as having a stewardship or custodian&#13;
role on behalf of its citizens.&#13;
&#13;
Under these conditions, it would seem that the decision of whether to use foreign ï¬&#129;sh&#13;
harvesting services is relatively straightforward: do so if they increase the economic&#13;
return from ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation.&#13;
&#13;
However, the net economic returns obtained from foreign ï¬&#129;shing, and especially the&#13;
sustainability of these returns, will depend crucially on the way in which the coastal&#13;
state exercises its stewardship role. If the coastal state leaves its ï¬&#129;sh resources under&#13;
free and open access, or common pool, arrangements, then these resources will not&#13;
produce their main economic return, which is the resource rent.&#13;
&#13;
Somewhat paradoxically, the Moroccan case study (appendix D) and the experience&#13;
of other developing coastal states tends to show that under free and open access con-&#13;
ditions, the use of foreign ï¬&#129;shing services may be the only way to generate substantial&#13;

citizens of the country as a whole through the payments         and Morocco), is that the coastal state will be in a posi-&#13;
made to the national treasury. The problem is that such         tion to gradually capture an increasing proportion of the&#13;
ï¬&#129;nancial returns are insecure because they do not depend        potential rents throughout the value chain through its&#13;
on eï¬&#128;ective ï¬&#129;sheries management. Moreover, if foreign           ï¬&#129;sh-harvesting arrangements. However, the proportion of&#13;

than domestic ï¬&#129;shers, then the overall level of ï¬&#129;shing          ple to determine. The diï¬&#131;culty is that rents are not some&#13;
eï¬&#128;ort will tend to increase, given the ineï¬&#128;ective ï¬&#129;sheries      ï¬&#129;xed amount awaiting collection but a dynamic amount&#13;

For the moment assume that, as is increasingly the case         seeks to take too high a share of the rents, it runs the risk&#13;
around the world, the coastal state has in place a set of       of stiï¬&#130;ing innovation in its ï¬&#129;sheries and thereby missing&#13;
institutional arrangements that encourage the economi-          out on future rent growth. This is of course a general&#13;
cally rational exploitation of the ï¬&#129;sh resources. Under         problem that does not only aï¬&#128;ect foreign ï¬&#129;shers.&#13;
these conditions, why use foreign ï¬&#129;shing services?&#13;
                                                                Many coastal states include objectives in their ï¬&#129;sheries&#13;
The answer is that if foreign ï¬&#129;shers have a compara-            policy to develop, for instance, product value addition&#13;
tive advantage, it will pay the coastal state to import         locally because of the supposed multiplier beneï¬&#129;ts, but&#13;
their services. Such a comparative advantage could arise        without ever considering whether they have or can gener-&#13;
for many reasons throughout the ï¬&#129;sh value chain. For            ate a comparative advantage in the activity and whether&#13;

In addressing this problem, it might be useful to draw on       The diï¬&#131;culty of ensuring sustainable cooperation incre-&#13;
the managerial economics literature, especially concern-        ases with the number of participants. Where more than&#13;

Another diï¬&#131;culty for the coastal state as principal is that     mation of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA)&#13;
it will face the classic principal-agent problem of uncer-      subcoalition.&#13;
tainty and asymmetric information. For instance, its&#13;
distant-water ï¬&#129;sher agents will have far better knowledge       Under PNA leadership, the Paciï¬&#129;c Island countries (PICs)&#13;
of their harvesting, processing, and marketing costs than       agreed to Harmonized Minimum Terms and Conditions&#13;
the coastal state can ever hope to have.                        for Foreign Fishing Vessel Access, established a foreign&#13;

A related problem is that many coastal states, especially       good standing and otherwise risk being banned from all&#13;
developing countries, do not have well-developed moni-          member coastal state EEZs, implemented compliance&#13;
toring, control, and surveillance systems. As a result, they    provisions that required distant water governments or boat&#13;

Under such circumstances, agency costs can be expected          this way, they have managed gradually to reduce agency&#13;

The aim for the principal, therefore, is to ï¬&#129;nd ways to&#13;
reduce the agency costs. The ways in which this might be        Although the leadership role played by the PNA was&#13;
done depend on the particular circumstances.                    important, success came through the support given by all&#13;

COMMON FORMS OF TIFS&#13;
Having set out in general terms the economic arguments in favor of importing&#13;
ï¬&#129;sh-harvesting services, this section discusses the form that these services might take.&#13;
&#13;
A ï¬&#129;rst case that must be mentioned, although it is not developed further in this report,&#13;
is trade at the level of an individual. Fishing companies in developing countries can&#13;
ï¬&#129;nd it proï¬&#129;table to engage in international trade in ï¬&#129;shing services by employing, for&#13;
instance, a foreign skipper or engineer who may have skills unavailable in the domestic&#13;
market. Similarly, they may ï¬&#129;nd it attractive to utilize foreign crew members, either&#13;
because of unavailability or cost on the national market.&#13;
&#13;
Other than such individual-based service trade, such trade occurs mainly in one of&#13;
three frameworks:&#13;
    Â» Foreign ï¬&#129;sheries access agreements (government to government);&#13;
    Â» Joint ventures; or&#13;
    Â» Chartering of foreign ï¬&#129;shing vessels.&#13;
&#13;
FOREIGN FISHERIES ACCESS AGREEMENTS&#13;
Much of the international debate about foreign ï¬&#129;shing has revolved around these&#13;
agreements, which have not always received a good press. Orellana (2008)10 summa-&#13;
rizes some of the main issues. He points out that although these arrangements may be&#13;
a signiï¬&#129;cant source of income for some developing countries, nonetheless â&#128;&#156;it is clear&#13;
that developing countries do not always get the best end of the access arrangement&#13;
bargains.â&#128;&#157;11 He argues that the coastal state may receive only a fraction of the actual&#13;
resource value and â&#128;&#156;more than a few access arrangements have led to the depletion of&#13;
host country stocks.â&#128;&#157; Foreign ï¬&#130;eets may contribute to overï¬&#129;shing, especially by discard-&#13;
ing catches that are not part of the access agreement. Developing countries may have&#13;
weak monitoring control and surveillance. Agreements may include strategic stocks,&#13;
for instance due to their importance for domestic ï¬&#129;shers or for domestic food security.&#13;

Before going further, it is important to clarify what kind                              ï¬&#129;shery within a coastal state EEZ, the output of which is&#13;
of trade foreign ï¬&#129;sheries access agreements represent. It                               entirely exported at a world price of â&#130;¬4 per kilogram (see&#13;
is easy to think that such agreements represent an export                               table 5.1). Suppose the coastal state faces harvesting costs&#13;
of ï¬&#129;shing opportunities. Orellana gives what is probably                                of â&#130;¬3 per kilogram, whereas a distant water state can har-&#13;
the standard deï¬&#129;nition when he says that â&#128;&#156;Fisheries access                              vest the same resource at a cost of only â&#130;¬1 per kilogram.&#13;
agreements can be described as a form of trade, where a&#13;
country with ï¬&#129;sheries resources in its Exclusive Economic                               If the coastal state insists on using its own harvesting&#13;
Zone sells ï¬&#129;shing rights to another country.â&#128;&#157;12 At ï¬&#129;rst sight,                          services, then the net gainâ&#128;&#148;the resource rentâ&#128;&#148;from its&#13;
there is much to be said for this description because of the                            ï¬&#129;sh resources is limited to â&#130;¬1 per kilogram. If, however,&#13;
apparent direction of the cash ï¬&#130;ows: cash is ï¬&#130;owing into the                            the coastal state decides to use (import) foreign ï¬&#129;shing&#13;
coastal state, which must therefore be exporting something.                             services, the resource rent would be â&#130;¬3 per kilogram&#13;
                                                                                        because of the distant water stateâ&#128;&#153;s lower harvesting costs.&#13;
In fact, however, appearances are very deceptive in this&#13;
case because, as Munro argues conclusively in appendix A,                               However, the coastal state will not receive all of the â&#130;¬3 per&#13;
the coastal state is actually importing ï¬&#129;sh-harvesting ser-                             kilogram because it must pay for the harvesting services&#13;
vices from the distant-water country. The payment for the                               that it chooses to import. This payment is made implicitly&#13;
import, however, is implicit and disguised because it is part                           or indirectly through the negotiated access terms. Suppose&#13;
of the gains from trade that the coastal state leaves with                              for example that the access fee is set at â&#130;¬2 per kilogram. In&#13;
the distant-water ï¬&#129;shers. The failure to appreciate that                                this case, the gains from trade will be split equally between&#13;
foreign access agreements are a form of import (coupled                                 the two parties.&#13;
with the failure to collect data on trade in ï¬&#129;shing services)&#13;
could mislead policymakers about how best to utilize the                                The harvester has a gain of â&#130;¬1 per kilogram (â&#130;¬4 revenue&#13;

In brief, Munroâ&#128;&#153;s argument is as follows. Although it may                               kilogram access fee but must deduct the â&#130;¬1 per kilogram&#13;
appear that the (foreign or distant water state) exporter of                            net return that could have been made by domestic ï¬&#129;shers).&#13;
services is paying the (coastal state) importer, it is crucial to&#13;
distinguish between the explicit and implicit payments for                              In other words, the coastal state is implicitly paying the&#13;
imported services. Consider the simplest case of a single                               distant water operator â&#130;¬1 per kilogram for its harvesting&#13;
                                                                                        services. This is the eï¬&#128;ective cost of importing foreign&#13;
                                                                                        ï¬&#129;shing: it is the share of rents left with the foreign ï¬&#129;shers&#13;

LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
This section draws out the key lessons that emerge from the legal and economic&#13;
analysis and from the case studies. Although the focus of these lessons is on trade in&#13;
ï¬&#129;shing services, this issue is so intertwined with the general ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation&#13;
system that it is diï¬&#131;cult to avoid discussing more general issues at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
IMPORTANCE OF THE BENEFIT FOCUS&#13;
Economic analysis proceeds from an assumption that the policy aim is to maximize&#13;
the sustainable returns from ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation to coastal state citizens in gen-&#13;
eral. The key element of these returns is the generation of sustainable resource rents,&#13;
broadly deï¬&#129;ned.13 Achieving such an aim requires the design and implementation of a&#13;
set of institutional arrangements (the â&#128;&#156;management systemâ&#128;&#157;) that will provide the nec-&#13;
essary incentives. There is no unique system, in either time or space, that will do this;&#13;
each coastal state must ï¬&#129;nd the solution that best suits its ï¬&#129;sheries at diï¬&#128;erent times.&#13;
The case studies oï¬&#128;er some insights into the kinds of systems that work.&#13;
&#13;
What is clear is that success requires that ï¬&#129;sh resource wealth, in the sense of rents&#13;
throughout the value chain, be placed at the heart of ï¬&#129;sheries policy. Such wealth is a&#13;
recipe for heaven or hell in ï¬&#129;sheries exploitation depending on the management sys-&#13;
tem. Where institutional arrangements are ineï¬&#128;ective, it is the implicit wealth of the&#13;
resource that drives overexploitation, which is why it is the most valuable resources that&#13;
are overï¬&#129;shed ï¬&#129;rst. On the other hand, with appropriate institutional arrangements,&#13;
ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation is capable of generating substantial amounts of wealth in&#13;
perpetuity.14&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
  The deï¬&#129;nition of resource rents throughout this report includes both nonmarket and market beneï¬&#129;ts&#13;
14&#13;
  The discussion here focuses on ï¬&#129;sh resource wealth because this is central to understanding ï¬&#129;rst why ï¬&#129;sh resources&#13;
are overexploited and second what is the potential contribution that ï¬&#129;sh resources might make to economic growth.&#13;
Evidently ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation generates other beneï¬&#129;ts such as health. A key policy question is to evaluate the&#13;
extent to which one set of beneï¬&#129;ts may need to be traded oï¬&#128; against another or, indeed, whether beneï¬&#129;ts can be&#13;
achieved simultaneously. Health and wealth beneï¬&#129;ts do not seem to be in competitionâ&#128;&#148;both depend on sustainable&#13;
stocks, although tension may exist between exporting and direct food security. However, unless the potential wealth&#13;
beneï¬&#129;ts are recognized and estimated, it is impossible to know what trade-oï¬&#128;s are actually being made, a problem that&#13;
seems to have aï¬&#132;icted the development of ï¬&#129;sheries policy in many countries around the world.&#13;

&amp;#12;It must be stressed that observing the crucial role played       However, although rights-based systems are developing&#13;

Observation of ï¬&#129;sheries policy (and related policy docu-         the way in which the coastal state policymakers perceive&#13;

the world suggests that the aim of wealth generation&#13;
underpinning economic analysis is not unreasonable.              Some governments may still focus on economic beneï¬&#129;ts in&#13;
The intention of ï¬&#129;sheries policy often is to maximize the        ï¬&#129;nancial terms, and in this case they may negotiate access&#13;
wealth beneï¬&#129;ts of ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation; it is achieving     agreements with foreign governments to provide a frame-&#13;
the result that is the diï¬&#131;culty. For instance, ï¬&#129;sheries policy   work for the importation of ï¬&#129;shing services from foreign&#13;
almost everywhere aims to improve product quality as a           ï¬&#129;shing companies. There is a big diï¬&#128;erence, however,&#13;
way of increasing product value addition. The aim is to          between this arrangement and ï¬&#129;nancial returns resulting&#13;
increase either ï¬&#129;sh prices or the return from ï¬&#129;sh landings,      from eï¬&#128;ective ï¬&#129;sheries management. In the latter case,&#13;
for instance by reducing post-harvest losses. If countries       the returns represent the resource rents, whereas in the&#13;
are not interested in the wealth potential of their ï¬&#129;sh          former case, they may have nothing to do with improved&#13;
resources, why would they bother with such objectives?           ï¬&#129;sheries management.&#13;
&#13;
Such policy objectives are generally uncontroversial but,        More frequently, it seems that governments focus on&#13;
unfortunately, although they make sense taken on their           the economic impacts of the ï¬&#129;shing activity itself, with&#13;
own terms, their ultimate impact depends crucially on            the focus on developing domestic employment, local&#13;
the nature of the ï¬&#129;sheries management system in place.           product value addition, incomes and livelihoods, and&#13;
In particular, if the access regime remains free and open        so on. In this case, policy will focus on those directly&#13;
(or if it corresponds to â&#128;&#156;regulated open accessâ&#128;&#157;), then we       involved in the activity (especially ï¬&#129;shers, but also pro-&#13;

There is a need, therefore, for education concerning the         perceived negatively because such services will be seen as&#13;

In the development of internationally funded projects, it&#13;
is important to recognize both the need to develop such            Because host countries have restricted ï¬&#129;shing in their&#13;

appropriate, do so through subregional or regional organ-        The key legal question is whether states that have yet to&#13;

players cannot expect to achieve stability. The key to suc-                      important role, in helping to ensure the long-term stability&#13;
cess clearly lies in deterring free riding. There are signs                      of the cooperative ï¬&#129;shery game that is the RFMO. The&#13;
that RFMO members are recognizing this and taking                                game may be best understood as a multistage game, with&#13;
steps against unregulated ï¬&#129;shing, for instance by black-                         the PICs ï¬&#129;rst bargaining among themselves, with the PNA&#13;
listing vessels and introducing certiï¬&#129;cation programs to                         subcoalition having the dominant role, and then bargain-&#13;
guard against ï¬&#129;sh laundering.                                                    ing with the DWFS members of the WCPFC, using their&#13;

Unfortunately, free riding is not the only diï¬&#131;culty faced&#13;
by RFMOs. Its members may also be asymmetricâ&#128;&#148;that                                Strengthening coastal state coalitions and their linkages&#13;
is, they may have diï¬&#128;erent management goals. To address                          to RFMOs will make it more expensive for distant-water&#13;
this problem, the RFMO must ï¬&#129;nd some way to imple-                               ï¬&#129;shers to ï¬&#129;sh the high seas in an opportunity cost sense, in&#13;
ment the compensation principle, discussed in section 4,                         that high-seas performance could be taken into account in&#13;
whereby the dominant players or subcoalition compen-                             the allocation of ï¬&#129;shing rights to foreign ï¬&#129;shers. Altering&#13;

In game theory, such compensations are called side pay-&#13;
ments, which may or may not be monetary in form. With                            However, a useful supplementary approach that may&#13;

this would mean that a playerâ&#128;&#153;s payoï¬&#128; from the cooperative                       performance generally, is to ensure that unacceptable&#13;

A key issue in considering the use of foreign ï¬&#129;shing            the very least, this requires clearer consideration of the&#13;

In many cases, coastal states may not be suï¬&#131;ciently aware&#13;
of the role that small-scale ï¬&#129;shers play or could play under    HUMAN RIGHTS&#13;

CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND AND AIMS&#13;
Approximately half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s economic exclusion zones are subject to some&#13;
form of foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangement. FFAs often provide access to the ï¬&#129;sh resources&#13;
of developing countries for so-called distant-water ï¬&#130;eets from developed or middle-&#13;
income countries. This study was commissioned to improve understanding of the&#13;
actual and potential cost and beneï¬&#129;t ï¬&#130;ows associated with these arrangements and to&#13;
provide general guidance on the means to secure optimal, equitable, and sustainable&#13;
returns from them. The approach adopted by the study comprises an analytical review&#13;
of economic and legal principles that relate to FFAs, with supporting empirical infor-&#13;
mation drawn from eight detailed case studies from around the world.&#13;
&#13;
FFAs AS TRADE IN FISHING SERVICES&#13;
Although the discourse on FFA has tended to focus on government-to-government&#13;
foreign access agreements, this report argues that such agreements are simply one&#13;
particular form of a broader set of provisions for international trade in ï¬&#129;shing services.&#13;
Furthermore, whereas it is widely recognized that trade in ï¬&#129;sh and seafood products&#13;
has a crucial role to play in increasing the beneï¬&#129;ts from ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation, the&#13;
importance of TIFS has largely been overlooked until now.&#13;
&#13;
TOWARD BETTER FFAs: DELIVERING THE&#13;
BENEFITS THROUGH TIFS&#13;
The study shows how TIFS can be an important mechanism for coastal states, espe-&#13;
cially developing countries, to increase the beneï¬&#129;ts from the exploitation of their ï¬&#129;sh&#13;
resources and enhance the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s contributions to economic growth and hence to&#13;
social welfare. Although ï¬&#129;sh resources already contribute to growth, as renewable nat-&#13;
ural capital, they have the potential to make a far greater and perennial contribution&#13;
than is currently the case. Under eï¬&#128;ective management, exploitation can generate an&#13;
investable surplus that can be used to fund economic growth and development.&#13;

Emerging Perspectives on Foreign Fishing Arrangements                                        31&#13;
&amp;#12;Although trade is an important factor in delivering this          EEZ. A few of these have operated in ways that have&#13;
contribution, the nature of international trade in ï¬&#129;shing         undermined the reputation of the whole sector and of&#13;
services and the beneï¬&#129;ts that accrue are inextricably linked      New Zealand itself. As a result, all foreign charter vessels&#13;

evolving worldwide, although much remains to be done.             The Alaskan case study presents a rather diï¬&#128;erent experi-&#13;
The key issues and policy questions are to clarify who            ence with TIFS. In essence, joint ventures were used as a&#13;
owns the resource, who may exploit it, and under what             way of transferring ï¬&#129;shing skills from foreign to U.S. ï¬&#129;shers.&#13;
conditions it may be exploited.                                   Together with various legislative changes, this transfer of&#13;
                                                                  skills changed comparative advantage in the ï¬&#129;shery, which&#13;
Experience from around the world suggests that these              went from being almost entirely foreign to completely&#13;

variety of approaches: some have opted for property               rights-based exploitation system, that substantial economic&#13;

may not be as skilled as the ï¬&#129;shers from other distant           to underestimate the inï¬&#130;uence that markets can have&#13;

in ï¬&#129;shing services that play a signiï¬&#129;cant and increasing role in strategies to optimize&#13;
the economic beneï¬&#129;ts from ï¬&#129;sh resource exploitation. The casework shows how&#13;
several countries have made and are making use of trade in ï¬&#129;shing services in a&#13;
variety of ways.&#13;
&#13;
Given the breadth of issues presented and discussed in this report, it is diï¬&#131;cult to distill&#13;
a succinct set of recommendations. While the authors oï¬&#128;er the following recommen-&#13;
dations for immediate consideration, they recognize that readers may wish to develop&#13;
them further.&#13;
    1. UNCLOS and â&#128;&#156;surplusâ&#128;&#157; principle. A workshop should be convened to&#13;
        consider the ramiï¬&#129;cations of the studyâ&#128;&#153;s key ï¬&#129;nding regarding the emptiness&#13;
        of the UNCLOS â&#128;&#156;surplusâ&#128;&#157; principle. This might involve the preparation of a&#13;
        preliminary legal review and downstream documentation to generate a better&#13;
        global understanding, particularly by coastal-state policymakers.&#13;
    2. Appreciation of TIFS as central to FFAs. This report, together with the&#13;
        output from the legal workshop, should be used to foster a great understanding&#13;
        of the central role that TIFS plays in foreign ï¬&#129;sheries arrangements. Moreover,&#13;
        formal recognition should be given to the proposition that TIFS is as important&#13;
        as trade in ï¬&#129;shing products by including the former in discussions at the FAO&#13;
        Sub-Committee on Fish Trade and at the FAO Committee of Fisheries.&#13;
    3. Eï¬&#128;ective ï¬&#129;sheries management. The centrality of eï¬&#128;ective ï¬&#129;sheries&#13;
        governance and management frameworks in coastal statesâ&#128;&#153; EEZ should be&#13;
        emphasized. Any potential beneï¬&#129;ts from FFAs should then be analyzed and&#13;
        considered within such legal frameworks. Given that eï¬&#128;ective management is&#13;
        increasingly likely to be underpinned by secure tenure arrangements, discus-&#13;
        sions should take place concerning the inï¬&#130;uence that such arrangements will&#13;
        have on improving the performance of international trade.&#13;
    4. Small scale ï¬&#129;shers. Following directly from the previous recommendation,&#13;
        immediate attention should focus on the requirement to include all partici-&#13;
        pants of the domestic sectorâ&#128;&#148;but particularly small-scale ï¬&#129;shersâ&#128;&#148;in processes&#13;
        to deï¬&#129;ne more eï¬&#128;ective management arrangements based on secure tenure&#13;

        with community-based and communally-held                   ï¬&#129;shing services into a more central position in the&#13;

        whether or not small-scale ï¬&#129;shers have such rights,        of their underpinning legal and economic prin-&#13;

REPORT SUPPLEMENT&#13;
&#13;
                       CASE STUDY SUMMARIES&#13;
This report supplement presents short summaries of all eight case studies. While these&#13;
are intended to provide a ï¬&#130;avor of the main ï¬&#129;ndings respective to each, the authors urge&#13;
the reader to delve into the full appendices in order to provide the complete picture.&#13;
&#13;
FOREIGN FISHING AGREEMENTS IN THE&#13;
WESTERN PACIFIC&#13;
This case study (appendix B) was prepared by Les Clark and presents the case of&#13;
foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangements in the Western Paciï¬&#129;c, detailing the process through&#13;
which the Paciï¬&#129;c Island countries (which here means the members of the Forum&#13;
Fisheries Agency) are gradually, but surely, increasing the economic returns that they&#13;
receive from their tuna resources.27&#13;
&#13;
Approximately 30 to 35 years after the establishment of their EEZs, most Paciï¬&#129;c&#13;
Island countries have a mix of arrangements in place for foreign ï¬&#129;shing, including&#13;
access agreements, charters and joint ventures, serving a mix of ï¬&#129;nancial and eco-&#13;
nomic objectives. Some PICs are heavily dependent on economic returns from these&#13;
arrangements, which provide 40 to 50 percent of national government revenues, as&#13;
well as providing jobs and private incomes.&#13;
&#13;
The data available indicate that access revenues grew from 3.5 to 4 percent of landed&#13;
value in the early 1980s, earning $13.5 million in 1981, to 6 to 8 percent of landed&#13;
value, earning $60 to $80 million in the 2000s. While much of this increase was due to&#13;
the increase in the landed value of the catch, especially with the development of the&#13;
purse seine ï¬&#129;shery, there was also substantial additional growth from the early 1980s&#13;
to the later 1990s, resulting from factors such as increased coordination among PICs&#13;
and enhanced ï¬&#129;shery management capacities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Indeed, as the Appendix makes clear, the process is far from ï¬&#129;nished. This is perhaps a good place to issue a general&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
warning that each of the Appendix is as up to date as possible but ï¬&#129;sheries policy can change very quickly.&#13;
&#13;
Emerging Perspectives on Foreign Fishing Arrangements                                                                    39&#13;
&amp;#12;By the mid-2000s, there was a growing feeling that returns    progress and faces a number of threats, an important one&#13;

The key legal question pertaining to foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangements          based upon the writings of Professor William T. Burke, Professor&#13;

INTRODUCTION                                                                  catch, it shall, through agreements or other arrangements and&#13;

The purpose of this appendix is to explore the legal and economic&#13;
principles underlying foreign ï¬&#129;shing arrangements. By necessity,          1&#13;
                                                                            At a later point, complications arising from the international sharing of such&#13;
we commence with a discussion of the legal principles. As will            resources will come up for discussion.&#13;

Emerging Perspectives on Foreign Fishing Arrangements                                                                                                 45&#13;
&amp;#12;  pursuant to the terms, conditions, laws, and regulations referred         by over-exploitationâ&#128;&#157; (UN 1982, Article 61(2)). Even this seem-&#13;
  to in paragraph 4 [Article 62(4)], give other States access to the        ingly reasonable constraint is not really binding. Another state&#13;
  surplus catch, having particular regard to the provisions of arti-        (for example, a DWFS), believing that a particular coastal state is&#13;

  mentioned therein (UN 1982, Article 62(2)).                               could object. Under UNCLOS, this could lead, it would seem,&#13;
                                                                            to the objection being dealt with under the Disputes Settlement&#13;
    So there we have it. Where the total allowable catch exceeds&#13;
                                                                            mechanism (UN 1982, Part XV). Yet, Article 297(3(a)) would&#13;

the coastal state is obliged to grant access to other states, certainly&#13;
                                                                            settlement, unless the perceived endangerment of the resource was&#13;
including DWFSs, albeit subject to conditions laid down in Article&#13;
                                                                            seen to be extreme (UN 1982 Article 297(3(b))). Then, the matter&#13;

                                                                            would be brought before a conciliation commission. If the com-&#13;

                                                                            mission found against the coastal state, the coastal state would be&#13;
forward enough. Nonetheless, it will be the conclusion of this sec-&#13;

is essentially empty.&#13;
                                                                            sees the power of the coastal state to set the allowable catch to be&#13;
    There are two fundamental questions arising from Article 62(2).&#13;
                                                                            â&#128;&#156;sovereign and non-reviewableâ&#128;&#157; (Burke 1983, p. 29). In essence,&#13;
The ï¬&#129;rst is how the allowable catch is to be determined in light of&#13;
                                                                            the coastal state can do what it wants in terms of setting the allow-&#13;
Article 56(1), which states that â&#128;&#156;in the exclusive economic zone,&#13;
                                                                            able catch.&#13;
the coastal State has sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring,&#13;
                                                                                The answer to the second question, the determination of the&#13;
exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resource, whether&#13;
                                                                            coastal stateâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to harvest the allowable catch, is much eas-&#13;
living or non-livingâ&#128;&#157; (UN 1982, Article 56(1)). The second key&#13;
                                                                            ier. The coastal state is authorized by Article 62(2) of UNCLOS&#13;
question, of course, is how the coastal state capacity to harvest the&#13;
                                                                            to determine its own harvesting capacity in relation to the living&#13;
allowable catch is to be determined.&#13;
                                                                            resources within its EEZ (Ibid.).&#13;
    With regards to the ï¬&#129;rst question, the determination of the&#13;
                                                                                If the setting of the allowable catch is wholly within the discre-&#13;
allowable catch, we commence with Article 62(1), which states that&#13;
                                                                            tion of the coastal state, and if the determination of the coastal&#13;
the coastal state shall promote the objective of optimal utilization&#13;
                                                                            stateâ&#128;&#153;s harvesting capacity is also wholly within the discretion of&#13;
of the living resources within the EEZ, and shall do so without prej-&#13;
                                                                            the coastal state, then it follows that a rational coastal state will&#13;
udice to Article 61, which, in turn, calls upon the coastal state to&#13;
                                                                            not declare there to be a surplus, unless it is in the interest of the&#13;
determine the allowable catch of living resources within the EEZ&#13;
                                                                            coastal state to do so. To quote Burke once more, â&#128;&#156;it is apparent&#13;
(UN 1982, Article 62(1)). As Burke points out, it is the coastal state,&#13;
                                                                            that giving access [to DWFSs] is not meaningfully an obligation of&#13;
and the coastal state alone, that can implement this goal of opti-&#13;
                                                                            the coastal State. If the coastal State decides that declaration of&#13;
mum utilization (Burke 1983, p. 29). The question is then whether&#13;
                                                                            a surplus meets its interest, only then is it required to give access&#13;
Article 61 imposes constraints upon the coastal state in setting the&#13;
                                                                            under terms and conditions it prescribesâ&#128;&#157; (Burke 1983, p. 30).&#13;

that produce the maximum sustainable yield. However, the article&#13;
                                                                            tion on coastal State authority to forbid access to foreign ï¬&#129;shing.&#13;

utilization above zero from a particular ï¬&#129;shery (Burke 1983, p. 29).&#13;
                                                                            which, inter alia, certainly allow the coastal state to demand remu-&#13;
He continues, â&#128;&#156;in light of Article 62(1) [promoting the objective of&#13;

    The one apparent constraint imposed upon the coastal state is&#13;
                                                                            must not be in violation of Article 300, the good faith and abuse&#13;

the early 19th century (David Ricardo), present day international            compensate (pay) A for its harvesting services. The compensation will,&#13;
economists, such as Noble Laureate Paul Krugman, insist that the             however, be implicit, rather that explicit. The access fee paid by A&#13;
doctrine has lost none of its validity over the past two centuries           must be suï¬&#131;ciently below â&#130;¬4.00 per kg to cover Aâ&#128;&#153;s harvesting costs.&#13;
(Krugman, Obstfeld, and Melitz 2012). Thus, with respect to a par-               In fact, in this simple stylized example, one can specify the&#13;
ticular intra-EEZ ï¬&#129;shery, the DWFS ï¬&#130;eets may have a comparative              range of negotiated access fees. They must lie between â&#130;¬1.00 and&#13;
advantage in harvesting, processing, or marketing the ï¬&#129;nished ï¬&#129;sh            â&#130;¬3.00 per kg. At â&#130;¬1.00, all of the gains from trade in services go&#13;

    Return to the example in which the DWFS vessels harvest the              Suppose the access fees were set at â&#130;¬2.00 per kg. The gains from&#13;

make sense, if the DWFS ï¬&#130;eet has a comparative advantage in                      Now let us return to the question of comparative advantage in&#13;
harvesting, but not processing or marketing. The argument would              ï¬&#129;sheries. There are numerous reasons why a DWFS might possess a&#13;

resource, this would represent a commitment of produced capital              distribution (see Munro 1985 for a full discussion). For example, so-&#13;
and labor that could be used elsewhere in the economy (opportu-              called factor proportionsâ&#128;&#148;such as relative abundance of labor and&#13;

harvesting the resource, the state would be better oï¬&#128; in seeing such         vantage. Thus, suppose that a coastal state, which has a relatively&#13;
capital and labor being used, not in the ï¬&#129;shery, but rather elsewhere        low abundance of produced capital, has oï¬&#128;shore intra-EEZ ï¬&#129;sheries&#13;
in the economy. On the other hand, if the DWFS ï¬&#130;eets possess                 that are capital intensive in nature. It then might well be determined&#13;
a comparative advantage in neither harvesting, nor in processing,            that the coastal state has a comparative disadvantage in both har-&#13;
nor in marketing then there is no obvious economic case for grant-           vesting and processing the relevant resources in comparison with a&#13;

    It is perhaps useful at this point to draw upon an analogy. The              There is in addition a special form of comparative advantage,&#13;

of DWFS harvesting, processing, and marketing services is analogous          above, we think of the coastal state in a fee ï¬&#129;shing arrangement as making two&#13;

one has to distinguish between explicit and implicit payments for            relative bargaining. The rational coastal state will strive to push the b(t) as close&#13;

    We next introduce costs and prices, along with some highly sim-                     Realistically, we do not assume that the coastal state can tax the&#13;

The use of FFAs by the PICs traces from decisions made in 1977                      The major objective is broadly to assist developing countries in&#13;
by regional Leaders at the South Paciï¬&#129;c Islands Forum. Noting the                   identifying the means to secure equitable and sustainable returns&#13;
developments in the Law of the Sea, the Leaders took a number of                    from FFAs. A useful starting point in analyzing returns to PICs is to&#13;

foreign ï¬&#130;eets were seen as longer term arrangements, while for          and Central Paciï¬&#129;c Ocean which establishes the Western and Cen-&#13;

Among PICs too, there were substantial diï¬&#128;erences, with some such       explicitly through instruments such as access agreements.&#13;

more eï¬&#128;ective for domestic development rather than access agree-&#13;

an important opportunity to advance the EEZ concept. This was           the application of penalties for non-compliance such as forfeiture&#13;

key elements of UNCLOS related to EEZs, particularly the sover-         ments.4 For example, Paciï¬&#129;c Island participants in a workshop on&#13;

The compliance umbrella aspect of access agreements was designed                           access fees. Cash grants are particularly valuable in the con-&#13;

         generate higher levels of access fees through oï¬&#128;ering greater                     scope for these payments in the future, perhaps ensuring&#13;
         ï¬&#130;exibility is based on the greater freedom oï¬&#128;ered by access                       that these grants do not contribute to over-exploitation or&#13;
         agreements to negotiate higher fees for vessels whose own-                        enable boat owners to make a fair contribution for access.&#13;
         ers could aï¬&#128;ord to pay more than would be the case if fees                        Such grants remain, however, a key feature and attraction&#13;

         agreements with a Paciï¬&#129;c Island country do have diï¬&#128;erent                          as in agreements with Japan, the aid tied to the access agree-&#13;

         to ï¬&#129;sh for less than it would have been prepared to agree to               enter into access agreements that included licensing conditions&#13;
         if fees were diï¬&#128;erentiated. In the same way, it is likely easier           rather than leaving coastal states to license vessels directly under&#13;
         to provide in access agreements for diï¬&#128;ering processes for                 regulations and license conditions. They included the opportunity&#13;
         adjustments of fees with catch values than it would be in a                to remind coastal states of their obligation, as they saw it, to give&#13;
         system of direct licensing based on published fees. There are              access to any surplus in the available yields that could not be taken&#13;
         however some major disadvantages in setting fees in access                 by domestic ï¬&#130;eets and of the requirement to take into account the&#13;

         often set by the boat owners in the ï¬&#130;eet with the least capac-             government agreements also gave some ï¬&#130;ag states a legal basis for&#13;

include:&#13;
                                                                                  most closely ï¬&#129;t the concept of â&#128;&#156;importing ï¬&#129;shery servicesâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
       a) multi-annual arrangements: The eï¬&#131;ciency of busi-                        would see PICs individually or collectively pay vessels to catch&#13;
          nesses throughout the tuna supply chain is generally                    ï¬&#129;sh, instead of having the vessels pay PICs. In this model,&#13;
          enhanced by longer terms for access to ï¬&#129;sh resources to                 harvesting would be competitively contracted. Instead of&#13;
          reduce uncertainty about supply, allow enhanced plan-                   the vessels paying PICs the current 6â&#128;&#147;10 percent of catch&#13;
          ning and enable producers to give assurances to customers               value for catching rights, PICs would contract vessels by&#13;
          of a relatively smooth supply of products over time. With               paying them a percentage of the catch with PICs retaining&#13;
          those kinds of beneï¬&#129;t increased returns can be extracted                ownership of the catch, which they could then sell or have&#13;
          for multi-annual access.                                                processed. Given the increased commercial involvement and&#13;
       b) pooling: In the regional purse seine ï¬&#129;shery, there are                  risks that would be taken on by PICs from this form of trans-&#13;
          potentially valuable gains to vessels from being able to roam           action, it is more likely that this kind of arrangement would&#13;
          freely across zones as ï¬&#129;shing conditions change. The value              be implemented through a joint venture with a processor,&#13;
          of this ï¬&#130;exibility will vary between vessels depending on               broker, or brand owner. The partner neednâ&#128;&#153;t be a processor&#13;

          and the FSM Arrangement are both pooling arrangements,                  ments for the catch to be processed under contract wher-&#13;
          but currently the days for those arrangements are taken oï¬&#128;              ever the greatest value would be created, taking into account&#13;
          the top from the TAE before PAEs are calculated. Addition-              PICs interest also in generating employment domestically.&#13;

       c) transferability: An alternative to pooling is to allow days&#13;
                                                                           largely removed. In practice, the continued use of bilateral access&#13;

       d) tendering/auctioning: It is only a matter of time before                of detailed regulations on access terms and conditions; and&#13;
          days are tendered or auctioned, either bilaterally for access        b) a reï¬&#130;ection of their political context, with ï¬&#129;shing states&#13;

          brokers or brand owners instead of ï¬&#130;eets: selling                reasons for moving to replace the process of negotiations over&#13;

to lack rights within the host country. In practice, this can lead         to reduce direct interactions between large-scale and small-scale&#13;

    The 2013 China Fisheries Statistical Yearbook reports that in 2012, of         Whereas ï¬&#129;sheries experts showed that China was overreporting its&#13;

Of these, 1,793 vessels with a total engine power of 1.112 mil-                    in 2012, valued at Y 13.21 billion (approximately $2.17 billion or&#13;
lion kilowatts were DWF vessels. The 2012 China Fisheries Yearbook                 $1.77 per kg).15 However, ï¬&#129;sheries experts estimated that the real&#13;
reports that China had 2,230 DWF vessels in 2011. The discrep-                     amount and value of Chinese catch taken outside of its own EEZ&#13;
ancy in the size of the ï¬&#130;eet is because while a majority of the DWF                annually to be 4,604,000 tons (with a margin of error of Â±687,000)&#13;
industry operates on a regular basis, a few hundred vessels operate                from 2000 to 2011, for an ex-vessel landed value of â&#130;¬8.93 billion&#13;

bers account for these temporary vessels and sometimes they do                     try, the total is 4,498,000 tons, or over three and a half times more&#13;
not. The 2013 China Fisheries Yearbook reported 1,830 permanent                    than Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s oï¬&#131;cial statistics report. The largest source of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

    Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s DWF ï¬&#130;eet is the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest in terms of number and                 (Â±241,000), Oceania at 198,000 tons (Â±31,000), Central and South&#13;

    The Quota Management System was introduced in 1986.&#13;
Under this system, ï¬&#129;shing companies and other individuals were                   300,000&#13;

to ï¬&#129;sheries. This settlement provided for the allocation of quota (or   in foreign joint ventures or put ACE on the market to the highest&#13;

To get buy-in from countries excluded from coastal waters in the&#13;

make surplus ï¬&#129;sh within their EEZs available to foreign ï¬&#130;eets until&#13;

new set of institutions and a new direction that governed not only                    intended to eventually eliminate foreign ï¬&#130;eets from its EEZ and&#13;
the scientiï¬&#129;c determination of total allowable catches (TACs) but                     replace that foreign processing and catching capacity with domestic&#13;
the allocation of those allowable catches to traditional users and                    capacity. Joint ventures became the ï¬&#129;rst contractual instrument to&#13;
new potential users. An important explicit aim of the FCMA was                        facilitate the transition from foreign-dominated ï¬&#129;sheries to domestic&#13;
to set up mechanisms, incentives, and plans to ultimately replace,&#13;
with domestic ï¬&#130;eets, the foreign ï¬&#130;eets that had previously plied&#13;

    The FCMA was founded on three major pillars. First, it man-                     of the biologically determined TAC. The harvester cooperatives then deter-&#13;

  To bring the story full circle, the harvester coop developed in the Bering Sea    group-determined norms, including quota holdings for both target and bycatch&#13;

            Trade in fishing services : emerging
            perspectives on foreign fishing arrangements
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report is an output of a World Bank
            study whose aim is to provide guidance to developing coastal
            countries in identifying the means to secure optimal,
            equitable, and sustainable returns from foreign fishing
            arrangements, or FFAs, particularly ensuring that they are
            underpinned by effective national management systems. It
            also seeks to encourage DWF or flag states to adopt
            responsible policies and practices with regard to the
            behavior and activities of their fleets. The primary aims of
            the report are as follows: to identify how coastal states
            might benefit from international trade in fishing services;
            to consider the conditions necessary for such benefits to be
            sustained and to increase further in the future; and to
            discuss the implications for different stakeholders,
            especially in the coastal state. The report centers on an
            analytical review of economic and legal principles supported
            by empirical casework to elucidate actual and potential cost
            and benefit flows associated with FFAs. It attempts to
            identify a set of relevant principles, particularly learning
            from case examples of best practice, which could inform the
            development of guidelines for future FFAs in developing
            country fisheries. To explore these issues, the report
            adopts a trade in fishing services (TIFS) framework.
            Particular emphasis is placed on harvesting services,
            although the post-harvest value chain and processing aspects
            are also recognized as crucial.
