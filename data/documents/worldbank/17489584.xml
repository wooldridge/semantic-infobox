including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary&#13;

considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the IBRD and IDA under their respective&#13;
Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
2.    Commingling, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
