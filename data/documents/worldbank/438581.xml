Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Second Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
L IN1RODUCTION&#13;
1.    The proposed Second Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project combines an&#13;
adjustment component in support of the budget of Republika Srpska, one of the two Entities that&#13;
comprise Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a transport investment component aiming to address&#13;
some of the large-scale damage occurring as a result of the hostilities in the country. This&#13;
Technical Annex complements the Memorandum of the Managing Director and the Credit&#13;
documentation prepared by the Bank in support of this Project.&#13;
IL ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT&#13;
Economic Background&#13;
2.    The declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of 1991 was&#13;
quickly followed by an exhausting war that lasted three and a half years. The war completely&#13;
shattered the economy and left extensive human and physical devastation. By 1995, Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina's GDP had shrunk by 80 percent from its pre-war level, and its per-capita GDP had&#13;
declined to US$500. Separate economic management systems within the country developed&#13;
during the war. Republika Srpska adopted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) dinar as&#13;
well as its tax, trade, and banking legislation. Within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
separate fiscal and financial policies and management were implemented in the majority Bosniak&#13;
and Croat areas.&#13;
3.   In the Federation, post-war economic recovery is weli underway. Industrial production&#13;
increased by 90 percent during 1996, reflecting the limited production base before the recovery&#13;
started and the large scale of international assistance. In 1996, about 80% of donor resources&#13;
were committed to the Federation territory, and the vast majority of them  are under&#13;
implementation. In Republika Srpska, economic recovery has lagged behind and began only&#13;
gradually after the lifting of international sanctions in February 1996. In large part resulting from&#13;
sanctions, donors provided just 3-4% of resources in Republika Srpska. Following the lifting of&#13;
sanctions, trade and the supply of basic commodities have improved to a certain extent.&#13;
Nevertheless, the difficult post-war situation in supply and production, particularly in non-&#13;
agricultural sectors, renains largely unchanged. Current estimates place Republika Srpska&#13;
production in late 1996 at 8-10 percent of its pre-war level. Because of the very low level of&#13;
economic activity and tax rate reductions early in the year, 1996 tax revenues of Republika Srpska&#13;
folU below their 1995 level, which forced further expenditure restraint in order to maintain the&#13;
budget balance. Credit and monetary expansion were also limited under FRY's tight monetary&#13;
program.&#13;
4.    War damage and resultng urgent reconstruction needs are large and widespread across all&#13;
economic sectors of both Entities. However, destruction did not occur uniformly and did not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

have the same effects on the economy in all parts of the country. Output fell most in the Bosniak&#13;
majority areas due to the destruction of large segments of the transport and communications&#13;
networks, water and energy supples, and productive assets, as well as loss of human ife. In the&#13;
Serb majority areas, the decline was also severe in terms of destruction and damage of basic&#13;
infrastructure, exacerbated by the economic sanctions on Repubfika Srpska, and difficulties of&#13;
access to and communication with Republika Srpska. In the Croat majority areas economic&#13;
activity has continued relatively less affected, at about 60 percent of the prewar level.&#13;
Macroeconomic Developments&#13;
5.    The Dayton Agreement and implementation of a major donor assistance program in 1996&#13;
set the stage for economic recovery, especially in the Federation.1 This recovery was facilitated&#13;
by continued adherence to the stabilization policies of 1994.  Important steps toward&#13;
normalization of financial relations with international creditors were taken in 1995 and 1996 with&#13;
membership in the international financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund (DMF),&#13;
World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). These&#13;
institutions helped Bosnia and Herzegovina to develop an economic policy framework under&#13;
which international assistance was provided. The framework encouraged mainnce of&#13;
macroeconomic stability by continuing to limit fiscal deficit of the consolidated public sector to&#13;
levels compatible with available sources of foreign financing. However, even if macroeconomic&#13;
stability has been so far maintained, post-war economic recovery has been clearly uneven between&#13;
the two Entities.&#13;
I     The donor assistance prgam provides across-thewboard fincal and technical support to ensure&#13;
sstainale employmnt creation and growth. The program's goals include preventing bottlencs in all areas of&#13;
infrastructure and providing basic services in heth, education and housing; ensuring minimal living stmdards for&#13;
the most vulnerable segments of the population; and rapidly establishing institutions for economic managment,&#13;
with an emphasis on the development of a private sector and the transition to a market economy.&#13;

rise of three-fbld in the course of&#13;
1996 (Table 2). Prices were roughly stable during 1996, albeit with high month to month&#13;
fluctuations. The tightness of monetary policies reflected the intention of the authorities of the&#13;
FRY to maintain a fixed exchange rate for the Yugoslav dinar.&#13;

S.    Though Republika Srpska's GDP is estimated to have expanded by 28 percent in real&#13;
terms in 1996 (from a severely depressed base), and industrial output to have grown by nearly 30&#13;
percent, the sustainability of growth is highly questionable in view of a paucity of domestic&#13;
savings and external assistance. The growth seen in 1996 was achieved primarily through a&#13;
restart of industry and other activities that did not require fresh investments or significant worldng&#13;
capital. Dearth of working capital and funds for investment are now projected to be the major&#13;
constraints to sustained growth in 1997 and beyond. Official data put estimates for Republika&#13;
Srpska's GDP in 1996 at US$828 million, which represents an increase of about 28% in real&#13;
terms over 1995. The industrial capacity utilization rate stands at about 16%, as of end-1996.&#13;
9.    It is notable that the share of capital goods in overall industrial output fel substantialy&#13;
from 1995 to 1996 (Chart l). This is mostly attributed to a reduction in military-related activity,&#13;
and therefore, reduced demand for military-related machinery.&#13;

Macroeconomic Policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its Management in Republika&#13;
Srp.ka&#13;
10.   The overall economic program for Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the continuation of&#13;
sound macroeconomic policies, the rebuilding of public administration, market oriented stucural&#13;
reforms, and the reconstruction of critical physical assets. The strategy has three macroeconomic&#13;
piliars: (i) the use of a fixed exchange rate as a nominal anchor through the currency board&#13;
arrangement; (ii) fiscal discipline, aimed initially at the avoidance of domestic borrowing by all&#13;
levels of government; and (iii) large scale external assistance on concessional terms. This&#13;
program is expected to be supported by a stand-by arrangement with the IMF, currently being&#13;
negotiated. In this context, Republika Srpska authorities have adopted an economic program for&#13;
1997 (see Annex I of the Memorandum of the Managing Director to the President).&#13;
11.  In 1997, the monetary regime will be gradually transformed with the institution of the&#13;
Bosnia and Heregovina Central Bank that will function strictly as a currency board. The passage&#13;
of the legislation on the central bank in mid-1997 after prolonged negotiations between the two&#13;
Entities signified unification of monetary policies at the State level. A domestic currency - the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
convertible mark - will be introduced and it will be maintained at a fixed rate vis-a-vis the&#13;
Deutsche mark. In the meantime, the Yugoslav dinar and the Deutsche mark will continue to&#13;
circulate freely within Republika Srpska, as will the Croatian kuna and the Deutsche mark in the&#13;
Federation. They will continue to be acceptable as the means of payment even beyond the&#13;
introduction of the convertible mark. Monetary conditions in 1997 are expected to continue to be&#13;
such that low inflation could be maintained.&#13;
12.   Republika Srpska authorities maintained a balance in the cash budget in 1996, with&#13;
domestic revenues and external financing covering total public expenditures. Thus, no reliance&#13;
was placed on borrowing from the domestic banking system or from the non-bank public; in large&#13;
part this outcome reflected lack of loanable funds within the banking system and the lack of&#13;
savings by the general public that could be used to finance a possible budgetary deficit. In accrual&#13;
terms, however, the budget was in significant deficit as arrears were run up in relation to debt&#13;
service, wage and pension payments -- estimates of the volume of arrears are, however, not&#13;
available. Hence, Republika Srpska's budget was clearly not on a sustainable basis in 1996.&#13;
13.   The Republika Srpska budget for 1997 has been approved by Parliament. The budget&#13;
focuses both on ways to strengthen the revenue base and on the prioritization of aqe diues.&#13;
Revenue increases are expected to stem mainly from a strengthening of economic activity and&#13;
impro-vements in tax and customs administrations. Tax policy will be guided by the principle of&#13;
applying relatively low rates to a broad base. Excise and sales taxes are projected to rise&#13;
significantly, but the growth in customs revenues will be relatively modest as it will be affected by&#13;
the introduction of the new trade and customs regime from the second half of 1997. The fill year&#13;
effects of the changes in the trade and customs regime are expected to be substantial, but will be&#13;
felt in their entirety only in 1998. Until this time, there is a clear need for fiscal resources to&#13;
support essential social expenditures and external debt servicing obligations.  Budgetary&#13;
expendiures have been limited to projected revenues and the likely level of external assistance&#13;
through donor financing, including quick disbursing support from the Bank. The budget execution&#13;
law permits reductions in all categories of expenditure (other than wages, benefits for war invalids&#13;
and survivors and transfers to the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina) as necessary to ensure that&#13;
no recourse to domestic borrowing becomes necessary. Payments on external debt (principally to&#13;
the Bank) are fMlly provided for within Republika Srpska's budget.&#13;
14. Republika Srpska authorities will take steps to strengthen budget planning, formulation&#13;
and execution through improvements in systems and personnel. These efforts will be supported&#13;
by technical assistance from the Bank and by a proposed Public Finance Reform Credit that is&#13;
being prepared.&#13;
15.   Fiscal discipline is reinforced by the current monetary arrangements in Republika Srpska.&#13;
The authorities lack independence in monetary policies as the major currency crcuating in&#13;
Republika Srpska continued to be the Yugoslav dinar, and in the absence of availability of credit&#13;
to the Entity authorities or private sector (beyond donor financing), increase in the demand for&#13;
currency could be satisfied only by running current account surpluses. In effect, the firm&#13;
monetary policies being followed by the FRY authorities in 1996 created the conditions for the&#13;
virtual absence of inflation in Republika Srpska.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16.   As for external assistance, considerable extenal financing will be needed to normalize&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina's relations with external creditors, as wdl as to meet the requiements of&#13;
the reconstruction program. Timely avalability of intemational support will be of crucial&#13;
importance in advancing economic recovery and transition.&#13;
17.   Since the beginning of the hostilities, Republika Srpska maintained a fiee trade regme&#13;
with the FRY; thus, the two Entities -- with the Federation enjoying a free trade regime with&#13;
Croatia - had differing trade policies. In addition, the customs tariffs regime and rates, other&#13;
import regulations, including restrictions, differed between the Entities. Three pieces of key&#13;
legislation have been passed by the State Parliament in 1997 - the trade policy law, the customs&#13;
policy law and the customs tariffs law. These laws will ensure common policies in all these areas&#13;
and will constitute an important step towards the formation of common economic institutions at&#13;
the level of the State. The legislation will go into effect once published in the official Bosnia and&#13;
Hwzegovina Gazette. Republica Srpska authorities are now required to take steps to implement&#13;
this legislation, inter alia, by revising the tariff code, removing quantitative and value restrictions&#13;
on trade, and revising the free trade area agreemnents. They will also participate in a tariff&#13;
conumssion with Federation partners in order to rationalize and liberalize the trade and customs&#13;
regime firther.&#13;
18.   With respect to structural reforms and the promotion of a market based economy, the&#13;
Republika Srpska authorities have passed an amended privatization law in spring 1996 which&#13;
provides for rapid privatization using a variety of methods. Steps are being taken to reform the&#13;
company law, develop a commercial code, strengthen collateral laws, and establish the framework&#13;
for a capital market, with significant progress expected in the second half of 1997. Republika&#13;
Srspka authorities intend to restructure the banking system with a view to rapid privatization of&#13;
banis and to encourage foreign participation in both bank and enterprise privatization.&#13;
111 TRANSPORT INVESTMENT COMPONENT BACKGROUND&#13;
19.   Large-scale damage occurred as a result of the hosfilities. Transport links leading to or&#13;
near confrontation lines suffered the most extensive destruction. Over 2,000 km of the main road&#13;
network were in need of immediate repair. Seventy bridges were damaged; all bridges connecting&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia were destroyed; no infastrucure      ce had been&#13;
carried out during four years; most of the railway lines were inoperable; Sarajevo Airport was&#13;
partly destoed and closed to regular civilian traffic; public transport vehicles and insbllations&#13;
were damaged or run down. Transport institutions lost premises, records, staff funds and, in&#13;
many instances, did not have access to those parts of the system which remained operable.&#13;
Moreover, the sector institutions were forcibly fragmented and communication was severed&#13;
among them.&#13;
20.   Since the end of hostilities, the condition of the transport in r  has sgnificantly&#13;
improved, mainly through the implementation of the Emergency Tranort Reconstruction Project&#13;
(ETRP) 'and IFOR/SFOR activities to restore strategic ira   . Road and railway links&#13;
The ETRP socured filzding of about USS145 million, ftom over 20 donors, including IDA which providod a&#13;
credit of US$35 million, of which 68% has boen disbured so fir.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
have been gadually restored in much of the country. Road traffic on part of the main network&#13;
has already reached prewar levels. The Sarajevo-Ploce and the Bosanik Novi/Novi Grad - Tuzlia&#13;
railway lines have been reopened to minimal standards but no commercial trains are yet running.&#13;
A few civilian charter flights are now serving Sarajevo Airport, and public transportation&#13;
companies are progressively resuming their activities.&#13;
21. Major transportation bottlenecks remain, however. In the road sector, more than half of&#13;
the main network still needs to be rehabilitated. Road maintnace needs to be undertaken&#13;
urgently to avoid firther rapid deterioration of infiastructure and maintenance organizations need&#13;
to be organized and equipped. In the railway sector, the economically important part of the&#13;
network has been restored to minimal standards, but operating agreements (paragraph 32) and&#13;
further rehabilitation are needed before commercial trains can run regularly. In particular,&#13;
signaling and telecommunications systems have to be restored to ensure safety. Extensive work is&#13;
still required on Sarajevo Airport to accommodate regular traffic. Public transport systems will&#13;
continue to require a considerable leve of assistance in the years to come.&#13;
22.   Roads and bridges. Damage to road structure is mainly due to lack of mntenance and&#13;
heavy traffic. Destroyed bridges on the main routes are redistributing traffic to under-designed&#13;
parts of the network, which accelerates their degradation. The ongoing ETRP is financing&#13;
emergency maintenance and reconstruction on about one third of the principal road network in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Republika Srpska succeeded in undertaking some emergency&#13;
mainenance activities on its own. In parallel, IFORISFOR has undertaken an extensive patching&#13;
program to rehabilitate critical sections of the trunk roads and instaled over 40 temporary bridges&#13;
on major routes, to respond to the emergency situation. However, it is estimated that in order to&#13;
totally reduce the maintenace and reconstruction backlog, an additional US$400 million will be&#13;
required.&#13;
23.   Tunnds and landslides. The problem of lack of maintenance, in addition to damage,&#13;
also apply to tunnels and landslides. Tunmels need urgent attention for structural rehabilitation,&#13;
water infiltration, and lighting systems. Numerous landslides have been reported which need to be&#13;
treated in order to ensure the safety of the road structures. As a first measure, 3 tunnels have&#13;
been rehabilitated under the ETRP, while IFOR and local governments also repaired some&#13;
landslides.&#13;
24.   Construction and maintenance equipment: Construction and maintenance equipment&#13;
has suffered from the hostilities as follows: (i) directly: much construction equipment has been&#13;
damaged or desoyed and replacement of these items is critical to ensure sustainability of&#13;
reconstruction and maintenance; and (ii) indirectly: through lack of maintenance and spare parts,&#13;
notably those which need to be imported. As a result of the embargo, maintenance units in&#13;
Republika Srpska are short of tires, which paralyze the finctioning part of their equipment.&#13;
Under the ETRP, construction, maintenance and asphalt/quarry equipment is being supplied by&#13;
various donors. It is expected that the ETRP will meet the equipment needs within the&#13;
Federation, while needs in Republika Srpska have to be addressed under the proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
25. Sava/Una miver bridges. All bridges conmecting Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia were&#13;
destroyed. Under the ETRP, works on the Orase bridge are scheduled to start by September&#13;
1997 and the Brcko railway bridge is being reconstructed. IFOR has istalled temporary&#13;
structures on the Vojlinja railway bridge and the Bosanski Gradiska/Gradiska and Bosansid&#13;
Brod/Brod road bridges. One bridge still needs reconstruction and eight others rehabilitation in&#13;
order to fiily restore communications to the prewar level.&#13;
26.   Railways. The railway system was severely damaged during the war. On the Federation&#13;
side, rehabilitation and repair works under the ETRP, led by the EU, made it possible to open the&#13;
Sarajevo-Ploce line on July 30, 1996. Conditions permit an average speed of 60 kn/h for two&#13;
pairs of trains per day, but in the absence of inter-Entity agreements, no commercial trains are&#13;
running yet (paragraph 66). On the Republika Srpska side, as a result of EFOR efforts to&#13;
rehabilitate strategic links, extensive track rehabilitation and bridge restoration has been&#13;
undertaken on the Vojlinja - Doboj - Zvornik line. As a result, the main part of the East-West&#13;
(from Bosanski Novi/Novi Grad to Tuzla) and North-South (from Ploce to Doboj) railway lines&#13;
have been reopened to minimal conditions (e.g. an average speed of 50 km/h on the Sarajevo-&#13;
Capljina section), allowing trains to run from Ploce to Northern Europe. However, infrastructure&#13;
conditions are still far from attaining international standards, notably as concems operating safety.&#13;
27. Civil Aviation. As a result of the hostilities, Sarajevo Airport was partly destroyed and&#13;
still remains largely closed to regular civilian traffic, and airspace control over the territory of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina was rendered impossible. The ongoing ETRP will achieve the first phase&#13;
of the upgrading of Sarajevo Airport to near prewar conditions. On August 15, 1996, Sarajevo&#13;
Airport was reopened to five non-scheduled civilian charter ffights per week and one carrier&#13;
resumed scheduled operations. But the persistent lack of civilian navigation equipment impedes&#13;
regular connections, especially in the winter. The rehabilitation, led by EBRD, is expected to be&#13;
completed by December 1998. The ETRP also includes supply of equipment to the Mostar and&#13;
Banja Luka Airports. However, resuming regular civilian flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
wil also require, inter alia, adequate passenger and freight facilities, inter-Entity and international&#13;
agreements to reopen air routes, and ICAO certification.&#13;
28.   Ports River ports on the Sava and Drina rivers were partially damaged and have sufferet&#13;
from neglect. The port of Ploce was bombed during the hostilities, the oil terminal was shut down&#13;
and berths require urgent attention. The port of Ploce rehabilitation is included under the ongoing&#13;
Bank-financed Emergency Transport and Landinne Clearing Project to the Republic of Croatia&#13;
(Loan 4104-HR).&#13;
29.   LandmineL  To clear a first portion of the 16,000 identified minefields in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, demining operations are underway throughout the country. Dewning is undertaken&#13;
to military standards by the local armies and IFOR/SFOR, and, to civilian standards, through the&#13;
Bank's Emergency Landmine Clering Project (Credit 2905-BOS). This project is implemented&#13;
by the Entity mine clearing agencies, with the United Nations Mine Action Center assistance.&#13;
These agencies are issiing project site risk assessments, and are implementing necessary studies&#13;
and demining operations. It is estimated that at least a decade will be required to clear most of the&#13;
mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
30. Urban Transport. Public transport companies have seen their equipment destmyed,&#13;
stolen or rendered inoperable through lack of maintenance, spare parts and tools. Under the&#13;
ETRP, around fifty buses and twaity mini-buses, including spare parts and workshop equipment,&#13;
have been delivered (mainly to Sarajevo) through the EU's Essential Aid Program and bilateral&#13;
donations. Twenty second-hand buses have been deivered from Spain and ten from Norway.&#13;
And an estimated hundred new and second-hand buses have been donated by European cities to&#13;
the main urban transport companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, two new traims with&#13;
spare parts donated by the Czech Govenment are on their way to Sarajevo.&#13;
31. Institutions. Weakness of the institutions and very limited budgetary support impede&#13;
satisfkctory development of road and railway operations and  nteace institutions. The&#13;
situation is most difficult in the Federation where the prewar road organization has been dissolved&#13;
with no new institution yet created to take its place. In the meantime the Federation Project&#13;
Implementaion Directorate (PID) and a road maintenance unit within the Federation Ministry of&#13;
Transport and Communications fulfill only part of the functions of a road administration.&#13;
Nevertheless, the creation of the PI) as weli as a road mintenance unit at the level of the&#13;
Federation to implement the Federation road and bridge program has laid the ground work for the&#13;
creation of a Federation Road Dirtorate (paragraphs 57 and 58). In Republika Srpska, a Road&#13;
Directorate is operating, albeit with insufficient maintenance funding, through a barely finctioning&#13;
Road Fund.&#13;
32.  In the railway sector, operating arrangements have to be agreed upon between the relevant&#13;
authorities which presently control various parts of the 1,000 km long network, in order to allow&#13;
railway operations to restart as soon as possible on the whole network. In the civil aviation&#13;
sector, some nter-Entity agreements ha  already been reached to permit the resumption of&#13;
civilian fights over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and an EU-financed Civil Aviation Master Plan,&#13;
seting out the full needs of the sector, has been prepared.&#13;
33.   The implementation of the 1996 prograrn demonstrated the lack of an adequate legal and&#13;
institutional framework. First steps to resolve this issue have been made, notably through:&#13;
* The Commission on Public Corporations, charged with fostering cooperation both at State&#13;
and Entity levels and developing legislation, to manage country-wide and intemational&#13;
communications (paragrphs 34 and 35);&#13;
*  The Program Managenent Advisor through the International M ment Group, assisting&#13;
the government authorities in overall donor coordination and program definition (paragrph&#13;
71); and&#13;
* The draftng of a Law on Roads in the Federation.&#13;
34.   The Commission on Public Corporatiom. In compliance with the Dayton-Paris Peace&#13;
Agreement, a Commission on Public Corporations has been established, under the chinship&#13;
of an EBRD representative, to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in the reconstruction of both&#13;
physical and institutional links between the Entities in the transport sector. This Commission is&#13;
composed of five members: two repreves of the Federation, one representative of&#13;
Republika Srpska and two international members (including the chairman) apponted by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
president of EBRD. The Commission is exammining, iter alia, the institutional transport issues and&#13;
has established working groups in the following key sectors: power, railways, roads, water, posts&#13;
and telecommunications.&#13;
35.   The above working groups were requested to identify the difficulties and shortcomings of&#13;
the public utility companies of the Entities, as weil as regulatory and other problems to be solved&#13;
in order to achieve proper power supply and proper communications within and between the&#13;
Entities. Emphasis has been put on linkages between the Entities, rationality and economic&#13;
viability. Although a practical approach is being emphasized and priority is being given to short&#13;
term requirements and related arrangements, the ultimate objective of the Commission is to&#13;
propose long term solutions and structures to the parties. Within the framework of its activities,&#13;
the Commission is actively addressing transport sector organization issues,1 fbcusing on: (i)&#13;
coordination, through the specific inter-Entities transport worjing groups; and (ii) development of&#13;
the railway operations, through a railway working group.&#13;
IV. WORLD BANK STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS IN BOSNIA AND BERZEGOVINA&#13;
36.   On April 1, 1996, Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfilled the conditions of succession to the&#13;
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.&#13;
Membership is retroactive to February 25, 1993. The resolution of Bosnia's arrears with the&#13;
World Bank, through consolidation of its IBRD debt, allowed regular Bank lending to begin in&#13;
June 1996. With a war-devastated economy, low post-war per capita GDP and lack of&#13;
reditworthiness, Bosnia and Herzegovina was declared IDA eligible.&#13;
37.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing, with the Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina authorities, a blueprint for reconstruction of the country's economy. A three- to&#13;
four-year Priority Reconstruction Program totaling some US$5.1 billion was presented to and&#13;
endorsed by a donors' conference co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU, following sgning of the&#13;
Dayton-Paris Peace Accords in December 1995. This conference, and a second one in April&#13;
1996, led to 1996 commitments of about US$1.8 billion from some sixty bilateral and multilateral&#13;
donors for immediate and priority reconstruction activities. A third donors' conference in July&#13;
1997 mobilized additional pledges of US$ 1.1 billion for reconstruction.&#13;
38.   During 1996, the Bank followed an assistance strategy aimed at jump-starting economic&#13;
activity through support of a broad range of economic sectors. Leveraging Bank resources with&#13;
significant fimding from donors was an important element of this strategy. Before arears&#13;
resolution, the Bank supported a series of immediate assistance programs through a special&#13;
US$150 million Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH). Seven emergency operations&#13;
were approved under the TFBI, including rebuilding of government institutions and fimding of a&#13;
line of credit to small business, as well as support for rehabilitation in the agriculture, water and&#13;
sanitation, transport, health, education and heating sectors.&#13;
Assuming the fimcdon of the Transport Corporation which, so far, has not been cnited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
39.   Since the start of regular Bank lending in mid-1996, US$207.6 million in IDA resources&#13;
have been committed, supporting an additional nine operations focused on clearing of landmines,&#13;
reconstruction of electric power, housing, hospitals and schools, establishment of a guarantee&#13;
facility for industry, and three programs to support recovery of employment through public&#13;
works, re-training and loans to microbusinesses. The Bank's assistance program also supported&#13;
the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional reforms: the Transition&#13;
Assistance Credit, approved by the Board in September 1996, was the first operation focusing on&#13;
institution-building in the Federation and a series of structural reforms needed for advancing the&#13;
transition to a market-economy. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has also committed&#13;
US$2 million to an equity fund and US$0.7 million for a microbusiness project.&#13;
40.   While emphasis during the first post-war year was on moving quickly with emergency&#13;
reconstruction across a range of sectors, the Bank's assistance strategy in 1997 and beyond will&#13;
shift to focus on sustainability and ensuring the medium- to long- term viability of policies and&#13;
investments. Significant donor resources will be needed for the next several years; however,&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina must increasingly become more self-reliant in preparation for the time&#13;
when these inflows are no longer available. This will mean viable government institutions,&#13;
sustainable government budgets, improved cost-recovery policies and mechanisms and structural&#13;
reforms that stimulate private investment. Three overarching objectives will guide the Bank&#13;
Group strategy: (i) further development of the basic institutional infrastructure for economic&#13;
management; (ii) transition to a market economy through deepening of major structural reforms;&#13;
and (iii) continued, selective support of physical reconstruction.&#13;
41.   Further policy-enhancing investment or adjustment operations are envisaged to support&#13;
institution-building at the State and Entity level, as well as key reforms in the areas of public&#13;
fiance, banking, privatization and trade liberalization. In the area of reconstruction, foture Bank&#13;
operations will support key areas such as the network infiastructure sectors of energy and&#13;
transport, as well as education, agriculture and other sectors essential to economic recovery.&#13;
Limited IDA resources will continue to make partnerships with other donors essential: mobilizing&#13;
co-funding for future operations, and coordinating strategies -- e.g., eventual exit from those&#13;
sectors where other donors are more fully engaged or have greater comparative advantage - will&#13;
be important elements of this partnership.&#13;
V. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
42.   The proposed Project consists of two components: (i) an adjustment component of US$9&#13;
nillion equivalent, which will benefit Republika Srpska, and (ii) a transport investment component&#13;
of US$175 million equivalent, which will benefit Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of&#13;
rehbilitating and relinidng national and international transport systems.&#13;
Project Challenges&#13;
(A) The adjustment component&#13;
43.   Republika Srpska budget is clearly not yet on a sustainable basis, although Republika&#13;
Srpska authorities maintained a balance in the cash budget in 1996. On accral terms, the budget&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
was in significant deficit as arrears were run up in relation to debt service, wage and pension&#13;
payments. Recent policy decisions taken by the authorities and enacted into law in the trade and&#13;
customs areas, the adoption of a sound budget for 1997, the measures to be taken in cooperation&#13;
with the Bank in implementing the budget as well as the trade and customs laws constitute&#13;
important first steps towards ensuring sustainability of policies and they deserve Bank support&#13;
through the adjustment component. Furthermore, a clear need exists for fiscal resources to&#13;
support urgent social sector expenditures and external debt servicing obligations.&#13;
(B) The transport investment component&#13;
44.   The restoration of an effective transport system is a precondition for economic recovery in&#13;
the two Entities: restart of industry and development of commerce are contingent upon the&#13;
removal of infrastructure bottlenecks. Hence reconstruction efforts aim to:&#13;
* remove critical infrastructure bottlenecks;&#13;
* resume operation of major transport networks;&#13;
* ensure sustainable development of the transport sector and related institutions; and&#13;
3 rebuild the local contracting and consulting industry.&#13;
45.   In December 1995, in a joint effort between the Government, the Bank and the EU, a&#13;
reconstruction program was prepared that envisages total emegency reconstuction fimding&#13;
requirements of about US$5 billion over the next three to four years. Within that program, the&#13;
finding for the Transport Reconstruction Program (TRP) was estimated at US$698 million to be&#13;
committed over three to four years.&#13;
46.   The TRP has the following objectives:&#13;
rehilitation and re-start of maintenance on the main road network;&#13;
* physical restoration and resumption of traffic on the main railway lines;&#13;
* re-opening of Sarajevo Airport to regular civilian traffic;&#13;
*  upgrade of Mostar and Banja Luka Airports;&#13;
*  rehabilitation of two ports on the Sava River;&#13;
* rehabilitation of public transportation systems in the main cities;&#13;
*  development of transport institutions; and&#13;
* implementation of related works (e.g. mine clearing), provision of consulting services and support&#13;
to institutions.&#13;
47.   While remaiing valid as an overall framework, the TRP has been reduced from an original&#13;
total cost of US$698 nillion to US$583 million to take into account the continuous update of&#13;
reconstruion   needs made through 1996 and IFOR activities - large-scale patching of roads,&#13;
instlation of many temporary bridges, and railway repairs. In addition, the time horizon for the&#13;
rehabiitation of the secondary and tertary road networks has been extended, since damage to&#13;
these networks is not of major economic significance. Furthermore, the first year requirements&#13;
temselves have been revised downward from US$301 million to US$163 million, to maintain a&#13;
coherent program while coping with: (Q) delays experienced in raising donor financing for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
transport; (ii) persistent difficulties in appraising a country-wide program; and (iii) a still limited&#13;
local absorptive capacity.&#13;
48.    The revised TRP would, therefore, require US$583 million (Table 3) over a three to four&#13;
year period as follows:&#13;
*  In 1996, US$192 million was committed, including US$145 million for the ETRP;&#13;
* In 1997, US$175 million is required for the investment component of the proposed Second&#13;
Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project (paragraph 49);&#13;
* In 1998 and 1999 about US$216 million will be needed.&#13;

49.    The proposed investment component of the Second Emergency Transport Reconstuction&#13;
Project (SETRP) will continue reconstruction activities under the ongoing ETRP.1 It adheres to&#13;
the TRP objectives focusing on the restoration of a sustainable transport system. The objectiv  of&#13;
It would also seek to cover the rmaining financing gap under the ETRP (about US$18 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
the IDA (F financed part of the investment component of the SETRP is to assist the Borrower&#13;
in further rehabilitating the main road network while supporting the progressive re-establishment&#13;
of- adequate road maintenance activities countrywide.  The remaining of the investment&#13;
component of the SETRP wiil be financed by donors, in the framework of the international&#13;
community support to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the pledging session of&#13;
the third donors' conference, held on July 24, 1997 in Brussels, donors pledged to the 1997&#13;
tranche of the reconstruction program about US$1.1 billion and an additional US$140 million in&#13;
support of peace implementation activities. The sectoral breakdown of the US$1.1 billion is&#13;
expected to be finalized by the end of September 1997.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
(A) The adjustment component:&#13;
50.   The adjustment component supports Republika Srpska fiscal and trade reforms, by&#13;
creating the conditions for efficient budget formulation and execution and for the effective&#13;
implementation of the recently approved trade and customs policy reforms. It is expected that the&#13;
counterpart funds would be used to undertake urgently needed social expenditures and finance the&#13;
xernal debt service requirements of Republika Srpska in 1997.  By supporting policy&#13;
implementation and the budget, these resources will help attaining fiscal stability and enhance the&#13;
prospects for the overall sustainability of policies.&#13;
(B) Transport investment component:&#13;
51.   The objectives of the transport investment component is the rehabilitation of the primary&#13;
transport network countrywide, and the reconstruction of the remaining key transport links with&#13;
the rest of Europe. The investment component will continue the reconstruction activities initiated&#13;
under the ETRP and will: (i) ranove critical infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii) resume operation of&#13;
major transport networks; (iii) ensure sustainable development of the transport sector and related&#13;
institutions; and (iv) rebuild the local contracting and consulting industry. The specific objective&#13;
of the IDA (ITF) financed part of this component of the Project is to assist the Borrower in&#13;
further rehabilitting the main road network while supporting the progressive re-establishment of&#13;
adequate road maintenance activities countrywide. For 1997, it is assumed that reconstruction&#13;
efforts made during 1996 will not be sustainable without a stuctred and strong follow-up to&#13;
devlop the emergency interventions into a concrete restart of the transport sector operations.&#13;
Furthermore, strong support is needed to achieve the necessary inter-entity arrangements aimed at&#13;
relinldng the Entities transport networks and setting up efficient transport institutions.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
52.   The project would consist of the following two main Components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
(A) The adjustment component (US$9 milion)&#13;
53.   The adjustment component will provide US$9 million to Republika Srpska to support&#13;
key macroeconomic policy reforms. The proceeds will support the approved 1997 budget in line&#13;
with agreed budget priorities that include essential social expenditures and debt servicing&#13;
obligations. This component provides needed fiscal resources that help alleviating the acute needs&#13;
of 1997; and&#13;
(B) The transport investment component (US$175 miDlion)&#13;
54. The investment component of the SETRP will concentrate on the principal road/railway&#13;
network rehabilitation of the remaining part in the Federation and the rehabilitation of the East-&#13;
West corridor, Bosanski Novi/Novi Grad - Banja Luka - Doboj - Bijeljina, as well as the North-&#13;
South Corridor, Bijeljina - Zvornik - Ustipraca - Foca/Srbljine - Trebinje, in Republika Srpska.&#13;
Thus, the investment component of the SETRP comprises a civil works component accounting&#13;
for around 60% of the total cost. Donors would be encouraged to finance civil works under&#13;
appropriate packages. The investment component of the SETRP would also complete the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Sarajevo Airport, and supply necessary equipment to Mostar and Banja Luka&#13;
Airports.&#13;
55.   The proposed investment component of the SETRP amounts to US$175 million. This&#13;
amount includes a notional allocation of US$38 million for railways, which may not mateialize&#13;
(paragraph 66). This component of the Project will include the necessary subcomponents to&#13;
overcome in a balanced manner the most serious transport system constraints not taken into&#13;
account by the ongoing ETRP. The inestment component of the Project would be divided into&#13;
three on the following levels:&#13;
a State of Bosnia and Herzegovina: items of an international nature including the rehabilitation&#13;
of the Sava/Una rivers bridges and of Sarajevo Airport;&#13;
e  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: rehabilitation of roads, bridges and Mosn Airport,&#13;
procurement of railway and urban transport equipment, including safety equipment, and&#13;
technical assistance; and&#13;
* Republika Srpska: road and bridge rehabilitation, supply of construction/maintenance&#13;
equipment, procurement of railway, urban transport and navigation equipment to Banja Luka&#13;
Airport, and technical assistance.&#13;
56.   Under the Project, the Bank would finance, out of an IDA Interim Trust Fund    )&#13;
Credit, the total cost of the adjustment component and part of the transport invesmn&#13;
component focusing on the rehabilitation of roads, reconstruction of bridges and related mine&#13;
clearing and technical assistance, within the Federation and Republika Srpska. In addition,&#13;
aintenance equipment would be provided to Republika Srpska. The IDA (IF) Credit would&#13;
also support the establishment, within the Federation, and the strengthening within Republika&#13;
Srpska, of road administrations. The following paragaphs describe in details all subcomponents&#13;
to be financed under the investment component of the SETRP. Lists of items to be included in&#13;
the diflerent subcomponents are attached in Annexes 3 to 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
Subcomponent 1: Roads and bridges (US$102 million)&#13;
57.   Road Maintenance Administration. A gradual increase of road maintenance to an&#13;
acceptable level is of prime concern in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Improvements are required in&#13;
both management and financing. To assist in this, a working paper on the organization and&#13;
financing of road maintenance was prepared by the Bank and submitted to both Entity Mnistries&#13;
of Transport. The proposals contained in the working paper to re-establish efficient road&#13;
maintenance activities and related budget have been generally well received. Within the&#13;
Federation Ministry of Transport and Communications (FMTC), an embryo current maintenance&#13;
unit has been set up and has so far managed the 1996-97 winter maintenance program. This unit&#13;
has also prepared a current maintenance program for 1997. A declaration of intent concerning the&#13;
setting up of a road administration at the Federation level has been sent to the Bank. It was&#13;
agreed that the road maintenance structure will consist, as a starting point, of two units: a current&#13;
maintenance unit, to be built on the unit presently existing in the FMTC and a rehabilitation unit,&#13;
to be built upon the existing Federation Project Implementation Directorate (PID). In Republika&#13;
Srpska, the road administration is presently operational but its managemet capacity needs to be&#13;
strngtened.&#13;
58.   Road Maintenance Financing. It was agreed that both Entities will allocate in 1997&#13;
about US$15 million for road maintenance activities. This will constitute a first step toward&#13;
susainability. However, estimated needs for a satisfactory financing level of road maintenance&#13;
activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina exceed US$100 million per year. Within the Federation, the&#13;
budget for road maintenance has been US$5 million for January to April 1997. Within Republilca&#13;
Srpska, the 1996 maintenance budget was about US$10 million.&#13;
59.   In addition to the routine and current maintenance activities to be funded out of budgetary&#13;
sources, US$100 million is required from the donor community for the Project, to reconstruct&#13;
firther priority bridges, landslides and tunnels on the main network and to complete rehabilitation&#13;
of the main road sections.' The program includes:&#13;
*  repair of 200 km of road sections (US$50.5 million);&#13;
*  repair of 12 bridges, including bridges on the Sava/Una rivers (US$36.1 million);&#13;
*  repair of tunnels and landslides (US$3.3 million);&#13;
*  construction and maintenance equipment for mainteance units in Republika Srpska (US$10.9&#13;
million); and&#13;
*  road safety equipment (US$1 million).&#13;
Particular attention should be paid to catching up with the repair and reconstruction needs in&#13;
Republika Srpska, where very few works were implemented in 1996. In addition, priority should be&#13;
given to the few damaged road and bridge links which may be hindering inter-Entity movements, as&#13;
wel as to links to neighboring countries.&#13;
1 BDeyd the rehabilitation phb of the primy network, the next objcive (pat of the 1998-1999 program)&#13;
would be to reduce, a extenively u possible, the backlog of mainteance on the whole road network. The&#13;
achievement of this obetive would require intenive participation of the local traport institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
60.   Roads. The Project would include the remaining priority links to be rehabilitated within&#13;
the Federation and would rehabilitate two main existing corridors in Republika Srpska; Bosanski&#13;
Novi/Novi Grad - Banja Luka - Bjeljina and Bjeljina -Foca/Srbjine - Trebinje. This would include&#13;
upgrading of road sections on an estimated 1,000 km of the principal network.&#13;
61.   Bridges. About ten bridges would be rehabilitated or reconstructed. It is expected that&#13;
designs would mostly follow the originals, provided that initial standards and construction&#13;
processes were adequate. In order to complete the rehabilitation of bridges on the main North-&#13;
South road from Bosanski Samac/Samac to Ploce via Sarajevo (E 73), the Karuse bridge has been&#13;
proposed for inclusion in the program. This bridge, located on the Inter-Entity Boundary Line,&#13;
has a one-lane temporary bridging structure in place which does not allow sufficient traffic flow.&#13;
62.   Sava and Una Rivers Bridges. The Bosanski Samac/Samac road/railway bridge is&#13;
proposed for complete reconstruction, whereas three other bridges on the Sava and Una Rivers&#13;
are proposed for rehabilitation under EU financing. Therefore seven out of the eleven links&#13;
between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighboring countries (Republic of Croatia and FRY)&#13;
across the Sava and Una Rivers would be restored.&#13;
63.   Tnneds and Landslides.  The SETRP includes the rehabilitation of tunnels and&#13;
landslides, mostly located on the road sections in Republika Srpska. The amount to be allocated&#13;
to landslides wiD have to be confirmed by both Entities, taldng into account rehabilitation of&#13;
landslides already foreseen as part of the road program.&#13;
64.   Construction and Maintenance Equipment.  Maintenance equipment would be&#13;
supplied to Republika Srpska to upgrade the maintenance units. Supply of tires is included fbr&#13;
loaders, graders and trucks used in maintenance and construction activities. The Project would&#13;
also support the upgrading of winter maintenance activities by equipping the maintenance units&#13;
with trucks and snowploughs. The upgrading component would be dedicated to physical works&#13;
equipment, necessary to gradually improve maintenance operations in Republika Srpska. Offlice&#13;
and engineering equipment would be provided through the institution building component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
65.   Road Safety Equipment. Significant discontinuities in the road network conditions, lack&#13;
of horizontal and vertical signalization, combined with an increase in vehicles and traffic are likely&#13;
to increase road accidents. To increase road safety, US$1 million is allocated to restore adequate&#13;
signalization and install crash barriers on the most dangerous parts of the primary network.&#13;
Subcompownt 2: Raihways (US$38 million)&#13;
66.   The railway network has been rehabilitated to the extent that operations on practically the&#13;
whole network are possible. The central focus must therefore be on creating conditions that will&#13;
allow traffic to resume (paragraph 32). As long as railway operations are impeded by political&#13;
difficulties, it is not recommended to include financing in the 1997 program fbr railways.&#13;
However, once it has been demonstrated over an adequate period of time that trains can run&#13;
across the network on a reasonable technical and commercial basis, donors would be encouraged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
to provide further assistance to upgrade the infrastructure to acceptable standards and restore&#13;
maintenance capacities, with a special focus on international accesses. Current speed limits and&#13;
line capacities (axle load and traffic frequency) are low, and safety is of great concern. Speed&#13;
limits have to be increased, not only for more efficient operation but also to avoid excessive rail&#13;
wear, which would result in high maintenance costs. The following areas would be supported:&#13;
(i) track upgrading and re-electrification of the economically viable part of the network;&#13;
(ii) supply of signaling and telecommunications equipment; and&#13;
(iii) rehabilitation and supply of equipment and tools to maintenance centers.&#13;
The priority railway investment program is shown in Annex 4.&#13;
Subcomponent 3: Mine clearing (UJS$1 million)&#13;
67.   Civil works sites have to be cleared of mines before the start of physical works. This&#13;
subcomponent would be implemented through the arrangements defined in the Bank's Emergency&#13;
Landmine Clearing Project. The site is understood as being the effective area where works are&#13;
planned, but also includes a reasonable surrounding area, allowing some freedom of movement&#13;
and a margin of safety for construction and repair teams. Cleared areas will be clearly marked.&#13;
Any civil works contractor selected under the Project would have to obtain a Risk Assessment&#13;
Certficate and obtain specific mine-related risks insurance coverage before starting works.&#13;
Subcomponent 4: Civil aviation (US$11 million)&#13;
68.   The restoration of air traffic between Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries is a&#13;
critical element of the recovery process. Efforts, led by the EBRD and the EU, are aimed at&#13;
resuming regular commercial flights and at restoring a civil aviation authority that could handle air&#13;
tffic over Bosnia and Herzegovina - a major source of revenue before the war. Actions&#13;
required include: (i) completing the rehabilitation of the passenger terminal at Sarajevo Airport&#13;
(about US$5 million); (ii) rehabilitating the control tower and supplying equipment at Mostar&#13;
Airport (about US$5 million); and (iii) supplying additional navigational and communication&#13;
equipment to Banja Luka Airport (about US$1 million). The contents of the 1997 civil aviation&#13;
program are tentative, and will be worked out by the EBRD and the EU in collaboration with&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina representatives.&#13;
Subcomponent 5: Urban transport (US$13 million)&#13;
69.   This subcomponent would consist of the supply of buses, spare parts and workshop&#13;
equipment, mainly in Republika Srpska, and the supply of tram sets and related spare parts to&#13;
Sarajevo. Buses would be provided to urban transport companies selected on the basis of an&#13;
ongoing countiywide urban transport study conducted by the Iternational Managanent Group.&#13;
As a contribution to the urban transport sector rehabilitation, a "1,000 buses" operation proposed&#13;
by Italy is being considered. This operation would provide 1,000 second-hand urban buses&#13;
donated by Italian municipal transport companies. This operation is still being worked out with&#13;
cost/benefit analyses, cost-recovery mechanisms, adequate cost estimates, implementation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
filacing 1 arrangements to be precisely spelt out. The Italian Govenmment is expected to proceed&#13;
in 1997 with a pilot operation of about 100 buses, and then to build the main operation on the&#13;
lessons learned from that operation.&#13;
Sukbcomont 6: Inrllution building (US$ 2.5 million)&#13;
70.   The Project would support the build-up of transport management and plannin&#13;
organizations, as wel as of maintenance structures -- taking into account the Transportation Law&#13;
existing in Republika Srpska and being drafted in the Federation.  The Federation Road&#13;
Directorate needs to be set up and the Republika Srpska Road Directorate requires upgrading. In&#13;
general, the operation and management of the maintenance units need to be improved. There is a&#13;
crucial need for training, in order to upgrade both knowledge and management processes.&#13;
Therefore, the Project would provide support for recurrent expenditures and financing for&#13;
equipment to enable the establishment and operation of the maintenance systems. The diflerent&#13;
items proposed in the institution building subcomponent are:&#13;
(i) Project Implementation Directorates (US$1,300,000): Equipping the Republika Srpska&#13;
Project Implementation Directorate and financing operating costs of the Federation and Republik&#13;
Srpska PIDs (US$300,000) to implement Project components financed by the IDA (ITF) Credit&#13;
(see Annex 8). This allocation comprises also an estimated US$1,000,000 to cover basic&#13;
operating costs of the three PIDs to assist donors in the implementation of their respective parts&#13;
of the Project;&#13;
(ii) Assistance to the Roads Directorates (US$1,000,000): Orgnization and operating&#13;
costs of the Directorates for the Entities, including supply of equipment and necessary training;&#13;
(iii) Miscellaneous Technical Assistance (US$200,000): this item is not precisely defined&#13;
but would provide flexibility to provide Technical Assistance in accordance with needs identified&#13;
during implementation. Possible items might include:&#13;
Urban Transport Assistance: Consulting services to assist urban bus companies in&#13;
improving operations, fare collection and cost recovery and in possible privatizing of&#13;
suburban services; and&#13;
Sava River Ports Study: The water and railway traffic to and from the Sava River ports is&#13;
presently non-existent, the situation of the Brcko area is still unsettled, and an agreement&#13;
between the Governments concerned regulating activities on the Sava River has to be&#13;
reached. However, a study would be required to determne the level of future&#13;
rehabilitation and investments on the basis of the expected volume of goods shipped via&#13;
the Sava River.&#13;
m Ameo_ion of ltaian municipalities and the lulian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have indicat their inlmet&#13;
in financing part of the operation. However, additional fids would be required to cover the supply of upr&#13;
p.m&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Subcomponent 7: Technical assistance (UlS$7 million)&#13;
71.   This subcomponent mainly includes assistance to the PIDs to prepare and implement the&#13;
1997 program. Foreign assistance should be gradually phased out and local consultdg groups&#13;
increasingly involved in project management. Required assistance includes services for:&#13;
(i) Project Advisory Services (US$400,000): Engineering services to assist the three PIDs&#13;
in setting up and supervising contracts financed under the IDA (ITF) Credit (see Anmex 6);&#13;
(fi) Program Management Advisor (US$1,000,000): these services, set up under the&#13;
ETRP through the International Management Group would continue in 1997.&#13;
(iii) Project Feasibility Studies, Design and Supervision (US$5,600,000): Required&#13;
feasibility studies, design and construction supervision under the Project.&#13;
VL PROJECT COSTS&#13;
72.   The estimated cost of the adjustment component is US$9 million. The estmated cost of&#13;
the transport investment component, is US$175 million (Table 4). The cost estimate for the&#13;
investment component is based, for the civil works and services categories, on average costs of&#13;
the latest contracts awarded under the ETRP, as contract prices underwent a noticeable decrease&#13;
during 1996. Furthermore, the use of ICB and NCB for works under the IDA (I1F) Credit will&#13;
support the "calibration" of the local civil works costs to international standards. The total cost&#13;
includes US$15.7 million to meet any physical contingencies for civil works and US$3.4 million&#13;
for price condngencies.&#13;

VIL Project Finandng&#13;
73.   The adjustment component of the Project will be entirely financed by a part of the&#13;
proposed IDA (ITF) Credit in the amount of SDR6.51 million (US$9 million equivalent).&#13;
74.      The investment component identified financing to date includes the remaining part of the&#13;
proposed IDA (ITF) Credit for an amount of SDR21.7 milion (US$30 million equivalent),&#13;
Netherlands (US$0.2 million), and Japan (US$0.4 million grant for preparatory activities). In&#13;
addition, the EC is expected to commit about US$52 million. Furthermore, as a first step towards&#13;
financial sustainability of the transport sector, it has been agreed at negotiations tat Bosnia and&#13;
Heregovina authoities should finance part of the reconstruction program.  As such, the level of&#13;
the beneficiaries counterpart funding includes US$2.9 million equivalent to cover 10%  of the civil&#13;
works costs to be financed under the IDA (ITF) Credit. Other donors would be ncouraged to&#13;
finance at least 90 percent of their civil works component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
75.   With the Entities contributing about US$2.9 million, the remainder totals US$89.5 million&#13;
and would be sought from donors pledges made at the Third Donor Conference held on July 24,&#13;
1997 in Brussels. A financing plan of the investment component of the Project is presented in&#13;
Table 5. The scope of the Project may have to be adjusted to match the available resources, an&#13;
operation which would be facilitated by the fully modular design of the project.&#13;

VmL INSTITUTlONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT DPLEM:ENTATION&#13;
77.   The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the Borrower of the IDA (ITF) Credit. The&#13;
Borrower will onlend, under subsidiary agreements, the proceeds of the Credit to both the&#13;
Federation and Republika Srpska on the same terms and conditions as the Borrower shall repay&#13;
the Credit to the Association. Donors will be strongly encouraged to coordinate their activities.&#13;
In this respect, they will be advised to use the information and assistance framework provided by&#13;
the State and Entity Ministries for Transport, the Bank the Program Management Advisor and&#13;
the Transport Task Force.&#13;
78. The adjustment component of the Project will be implemented by the Republika Srpska&#13;
Ministry of Finance, with the Credit proceeds flowing to the Republika Srpska budget account.&#13;
The investment component of the IDA (ITF) Credit would be implemented through the Entities&#13;
PIDs, which will have a central role in coordination of all reconstruction activities in the transport&#13;
sector. To that effect, donors would be encouraged to use and financially support the PIDs. To&#13;
enhance the efficient use of resources, donors will also be encouraged to liaise with the Transport&#13;
Task Force in Sarajevo, comprised of representatives of the Governments and the main donors in&#13;
the transport sector, in order to ensure the appropriateness of donors' projects on the ground. On&#13;
the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Program Management Advisor, as defined under the&#13;
ETRP, as well as his two deputies, one in each entity, would assist the respective ministries in&#13;
their relations with the donor community, and the PIDs in implementing their tasks.&#13;
79.  Procurement: The following procurement section relates only to the investment part of&#13;
the IDA (IIF) Credit and Bank-administered donors' funds. Considerable experience was gained&#13;
under the ETRP. The fast-track approach 1 used for a quick contracting of works has been&#13;
uccessfl, and will also be used under the Project. Intemational competition will be used more&#13;
extensively than under the ETRP. Therefore, thresholds for International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB) have been lowered under the part of the Project that will be procured according to the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines. A postqualification of Bidders would be applied for each contract to be&#13;
procured following ICB or National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. Procurement will&#13;
be processed in close coordination with the Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit (PMAIU).&#13;
80.   Procurement under the IDA (MIT) Credit will follow the Bank's G elinc: Procwwnen&#13;
under IBRD Loas and iDA Credts, Januay 1995, Revised Jwwary 1996 wnd August 1996&#13;
and the Guidelines: Use of Consulans by World Bank Borwers and by World Bank as&#13;
&amp;ecuang Agency, Jwauiy 1997 in all respects, except that counties that are iigible to&#13;
borrow from the IBMD or IDA and that do not parucipt in financing of the lTP will be&#13;
ineligible sources. Furthermore, with the exception of Bank administered donors' funds, which&#13;
will follow the standard Bank Guidelines, all other procurement will be on a paralle basis and will&#13;
follow the procurement procedures of each donor. A procurement plan is attached.&#13;
IXu approcwh, bah  on the Small Wora Procuremet Prooduras (paragrph 88), allown the preparton of&#13;
bidding documts to go in parallel with the design. The biddhlg documenta not to the potential bidders oonain&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
81.   Advertisement: A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in Development&#13;
Business in March 1997 announcing works, goods and consultants services to be procured and&#13;
initing interested eligible suppliers, contractors and consultants to express interest and to request&#13;
any complementary information from the project implementation agencies. The GPN has also&#13;
been published in Bosnian, Serbian and English in the local press.&#13;
82.   For procurement under the IDA (ITF) Credit, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
modified in light of the ITF procurement eligibility guidelines, will be used. For procurement&#13;
under Bank administered trust fiinds, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used.&#13;
These documents have already been customized under the ETRP, approved for each component&#13;
and translated. The period allowed for submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks.&#13;
83. Goods: International Competitive Bidding (ICB): ICB will be used to procure goods for&#13;
contracts esimated to cost more than US$500,000 each. Cost of local transportation would not&#13;
be eligible for repayment under the IDA (rIF) Credit.&#13;
84.  International Shopping (IS): IS will be used for procuring project equipment and matials&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$100,000 and less than US$500,000 per contract, up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$1.0 million. IS is based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at&#13;
least three suppliers in at least two countries.&#13;
85. National Shopping (NS): This method will be used to procure locally available goods, for&#13;
contracts to cost less than US$100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000,&#13;
with at least three quotations obtained from local suppliers. NS will be mainly used to procure&#13;
equipment for the PIDs.&#13;
86. Works: International Competitive Bidding (ICB): ICB for works will be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost more than US$2.0 milion each.&#13;
87. National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Given the dispersed nature of works (repairs of&#13;
roads, etc.), NCB is will be used for contrcts over US$1.0 million but less than US$2.0 million&#13;
per contract. However, interested foreign contractors will be allowed to participate in NCB.&#13;
88.   Small Works Procurement Procedure: Small Works Procurement Procedure will be used&#13;
for works contracts estimated to cost up to US$1.0 million per contract. These works will be&#13;
procured under lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. A list of local qualified&#13;
contractors is already available in the Federation. A similar list will be drawn up in Republika&#13;
Srpska in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The invitation shall&#13;
include a detailed description of works, including basic specifications, the required completion&#13;
period, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank and relevant drawing, where&#13;
applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for&#13;
the required work, and who has the experience and resources to succesflly complete the&#13;
contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
89. Direct Contracting for Works: Any direct contracting not identified in the procurement&#13;
plan will be subject to the Bank's prior approval. Such approval has been obtained for the&#13;
Ostrozac bridge on M17 between Jablanica and Konjic as this conract would cover the&#13;
completion of the bridge construction which was interrupted by the hostilities (estimated cost&#13;
US$1.5 million).&#13;
90.   The mine clearing subcomponent of the investment component of the IDA (ITF) Credit&#13;
would be carried out under the Emergency Landmine Clearance Project for Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina. Therefore, the procurement procedures would be those used under that project&#13;
(National Competitive Bidding in which foreign firms are not precluded from participating). The&#13;
tasks involved would be to: (i) determine whether there are landmines in the areas where project&#13;
works are to be carried out; and (ii) remove the mines where needed.&#13;
91. Services: Consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997, which shall&#13;
include mainly selection procedures based on Consultants' Qualifications and Least-Cost.&#13;
Procurement documentation for contracts with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 each will&#13;
also be subject to Bank's prior review. For individuals, the prior review threshold will be&#13;
US$50,000. Follow up assignments will be permissible to the extent that this will be indicated in&#13;
the initial TORs.&#13;
92.   The project elements to be financed out of the investment part of the IDA (F) Credit,&#13;
their esfimated costs and the procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 7.&#13;

93. Credit effectiveness is expected in early September 1997 and start of the physical&#13;
implementation in October 1997. Completion of activities under the IDA CIT) Credit is expected&#13;
fir December 31, 1999, with the proposed Credit closing six months later on June 30, 2000. The&#13;
implementation plan for the non-WDA financed part of the project will be updated by the Bank in&#13;
accordance once the breakdown of the donors' pledges made at the Third Donor Conference will&#13;
have been finalized.&#13;
94.    Prior Review: Prior review in accordance with paragaph 2 of the Appendix 1 of the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines will be followed for: (3) Goods: all ICB and IS; (ii) Works: all ICB and Direct&#13;

(inclucding contigenies)&#13;
96.   Special Accounts:  To facilitate timely project implementation of the investment&#13;
component, the Borrower would open, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, two Special&#13;
Accounts, to be maintained and operated by each Entity through their respective PIDs, in a&#13;
currency and a bank to be agreed upon. The authorized allocation of each of the two Special&#13;
Accounts would be limited to US$2.0 million. Replenishment applications should be submitted&#13;
on a monthly basis, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate&#13;
documents. The PIDs should have exclusive access to the funds concerning their respective&#13;
operations.&#13;
97.   Statements of Expenditure (SOEs): Disbursements would be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditures for contracts (a) for works up to US$2,000,000 equivalent with the exception of&#13;
the first contract between US$1,000,000 and US$2,000,000; (b) for goods up to US$500,000; (c)&#13;
all incremental operating costs; (d) for consulting firms up to US$100,000 equivalent; and (e) for&#13;
individual consultants up to US$50,000 equivalent, for which detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures will be reviewed by both PIDs and their respective Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications, and made available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
missions. Disbursements against contracts exceeding US$2,000,000 equivalent would be made&#13;
against normal documentation.&#13;
98.   Accounts: Separate and auditable project accounts would be established in the Entity&#13;
Ministries of Transport and Communications. The project accounts would comprise: (i) a record&#13;
of withdrawals from the IDA (ITF) Credit with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying&#13;
documentation; (ii) a record of transactions of the Special Accounts and the copies of the bank&#13;
statements on this account. Project account documentation would be maintained for one year&#13;
after they have been audited.&#13;
99.   Audits: The project accounts would be audited at the end of each fiscal year of the&#13;
Borrower by independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate&#13;
audit statements would be prepared for the Special Accounts and for Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest six months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year.&#13;
100. Reporting: The PIDs will prepare and furnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports (see&#13;
Annex 7) showing the status of implementation of the project, as well as financial reports, in a&#13;
format and content acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
101. Supervision Plan: Project implementation would incorporate maximum flexibility in view&#13;
of the fact that it will need to be adapted to changing circumstances. Implementation progress&#13;
would be evaluated at mid-term, i.e. approximately 12 months after effectiveness. The review&#13;
would assess the need for any adjustments, based on implementation experience to date. It is&#13;
expected that the Bank Resident Mission in Sarajevo would handle most of the procurement&#13;
review and supervision of activities financed out of the IDA (ITF) Credit.&#13;
102. Enviromnmental Aspects. The Project is expected to include the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of existing infrastructure and as such will not require any land acquisition. The&#13;
relative small scale of works would not require the opening of new quarries or asphalt plants sites.&#13;
Furthermore, by improving badly damaged roads surface, shoulders and drainage, and removing&#13;
downed bridge decks from rivers and their banks, the Project would have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment. Therefore and as an emergency operation, the Project has not been assigned an&#13;
environmental category. However, any subcomponents which present an opportunity for&#13;
environmental enhancement will be designed accordingly, and all subcomponents will be&#13;
monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no degradation to the environment.&#13;
IX. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
103.  The adjustment component of the Credit provides the Bank with a vehicle to support&#13;
fiscal and trade reforms in Republika Srpska, which have been prominent elements in the&#13;
economic dialogue with the authorities over the last year. The policy decisions taken by&#13;
Republika Srpska authorities and enacted into law in the trade and customs areas, the adoption of&#13;
a sound budget for 1997, the measures to be taken in cooperation with the Bank in implementing&#13;
the budget as well as the trade and customs laws constitute important first steps toward ensuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
sustainability of macroeconomic policies. Also, the authorities are putting in place an overall&#13;
reform framework with the purpose of developing a market based economy rapidly. Meanwhile,&#13;
a clear need exists for fiscal resources to support urgent social expenditures and external debt&#13;
servicing obligations. During 1996, IDA's Board approved eight projects providing financial&#13;
support to both Entities. However, none of them provided adjustment assistance to Republika&#13;
Srpska in support of macroeconomic reforms. Such support was provided to the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina through the IDA-supported Transition Assistance Credit.  The&#13;
adjustment component supported by this project should be seen as the first element in a program&#13;
of envisaged adjustment lending from which Republika Srpska will benefit. Further adjustment&#13;
credits could be considered in late 1997 and beyond in support of firther reform of public&#13;
finances, as weil as privatization of enterprises and banks - but the timing of the support will&#13;
depend crucially on reform measures being adopted.&#13;
104. With respect to the transport investment component, the Project derives from the&#13;
Reconstruction Sector Reports prepared jointly by the Bank, the EBRD and EU for the&#13;
Information Conference held in January 1997, and the third donors' conference. The sector&#13;
reports emphasize that to restart production and employment on any significant scale,&#13;
economically important rail and road linkages have to be secured quicldy. The investment&#13;
component of the Project therefore supports a key objective in the Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
reconstruction strategy, namely the rehabilitation of the transport network, to underpin the&#13;
reconstruction and economic development of the country. As the World Bank has taken the lead&#13;
in the international reconstruction effort and in coordinating aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
substantial IDA involvement is of prime importance in order to mobilize the required resources.&#13;
105.  Economic Justification. For the road subcomponent of the investment component, the&#13;
ERR has been estimated at more than 30%, using the Highway Design and Maintenance&#13;
Standards Model (HDM) III model (see Annex 9). Part of the data used in the economic&#13;
evaluation are best estimates; in the absence of precise information and the still highly changing&#13;
traffic patterns. Traffic growth has been estimated at about 3 to 4% per annum, and vehicle&#13;
operating costs were calculated using input data from the Albania-adapted HDM III model. For&#13;
other civil works subcomponents of the investment component, including mainly reconstruction or&#13;
rehabilitation of bridges and rehabilitation of landslides all located on the principal network, the&#13;
rates of return are expected to be high since: (i) downed bridges are critical bottlenecks causing,&#13;
at certain locations, long waiting times. Furthermore, damaged bridges are being used, despite&#13;
the constant risk of coilapse; and (ii) rehabilitation of landslides will avoid fiuther degradation of&#13;
the road sections.&#13;
106. Moreover, the Project will support the restart of industry by re-establishment of transport&#13;
links; and jobs will be created directly for the construction and local consultant industry through&#13;
the road and bridge reconstruction and maintenance program. As a serviceable transport system&#13;
is essential for the economy, the project will also indirectly support the creation of jobs&#13;
throughout the territory.&#13;
107. Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA InvolvementL A multitude of important lessons has&#13;
been learned from Bank-supported emergency projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 1996,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
covering adjustment and investment operations. At a cross-sectoral level, the Bank has learned&#13;
important lessons as to the institutional framework necessary to allow timely and sustainable&#13;
reconstruction investments to take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
108.  Regarding the adjusmnent component, a recent Country Portfolio Performance Review&#13;
highlighted that close attention must be placed on implementation of underlying reforms and the&#13;
execution of the budget as planned. The experience from the previous adjustment operation, the&#13;
Transition Assistance Credit, suggests that specific arrangements should be made to ensure that&#13;
counterpart funds finance agreed priority expenditures. This lesson has been taken into account in&#13;
the design of the proposed adjustment component, which would help to support agreed priority&#13;
social expenditures and debt servicing obligations set out in the Republika Srpska's approved&#13;
1997 budget.&#13;
109. As for the transport investment component, lessons learned while implementing the&#13;
ETRP have been taken into account as foilows: (i) the fast-track civil works procurement&#13;
approach used under the ETRP has been successful, allowing for quick award and implementation&#13;
start of the contracts. This approach will also be used under the Project; (ii) foreign technical&#13;
support has been crucial in 1996, and the Bank recommends that it be maintained at a reduced&#13;
level in 1997, in order to gradually increase the technical responsibilities of local authorities and&#13;
consultants; (iii) rehabilitation requires not only repairs but also maintenance.  Thus far,&#13;
IFOR/SFOR has assisted in most critical maintenance works but this will not continue. Entity&#13;
authorities have to assume these responsibilities -- and need to be supported to that effect. Under&#13;
the institution building component of the Project, assistance in maintenance organization, supply&#13;
of basic equipment to undertake maintenance, and staff training will be provided to both Entities'&#13;
Road Administrations; and (iv) the institutions involved in the transport sector should receive the&#13;
funding necessary to fulfill their mandate. Both Entities' Governments have been requested to&#13;
allocate adequate budgets to road maintenance.&#13;
Risks&#13;
110.  The main project-specific risks in the adjustment component of the Project stem from&#13;
possible weaknesses of the Republika Srspka authorities in the implementation of the 1997&#13;
budget, and in the implementation of planned reforms in the fiscal, customs and trade areas, and&#13;
possible slippages in policy planning and execution of further reforms, in particular, enterprise and&#13;
bank privatization, and less than whole-hearted engagement in the pursuit of market oriented&#13;
reforms. The risks in the policy areas would be addressed by the Bank continuing to maintain its&#13;
strong policy dialogue with the authorities and by a concerted program of technical assistance by&#13;
the Bank and by other donors in all the reform areas -- this wider program of technical assistance&#13;
is being coordinated by the Bank. The Republika Srpska authorities have shown increasing&#13;
responsiveness to the policy dialogue with the Bank. The Bank intends to maintain this intensive&#13;
policy dialogue with the aim of ensuring that reform policies in line with the Dayton/Paris Accord&#13;
are adopted. Risks are mitigated also by the program of adjustment lending currendy under&#13;
discussion with the authorities covering public finance reform and support of enterprise and bank&#13;
privatization within the context of promoting a market based economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
111. Regarding the investment component, both the Governments and the Bank are better&#13;
prepared, thanks to the implementation of the ETRP, to handle project related risks. Assuming&#13;
that peace is maintained, project risks include: (i) overextending the local construction capacity&#13;
(not less than five infrastructure projects will be implemented this year). To mitigate this risk,&#13;
local contractors will be advised to form joint ventures with foreign companies and NCB as wel&#13;
as ICB would be broadly used; (ii) delays in implementation due to the fragility of institutions.&#13;
However, the implementation of the ETRP has already strengthened the institutions and the&#13;
technical assistance to be provided under the Project wil ensure adequate institutional capacity;&#13;
(iii) delays in program progress due to a slow implementation of the mine clearing component. So&#13;
far, however, under the ETRP, mine clearing activities have not constituted an obstacle to works&#13;
progress; (iv) failure to close the financing gap. If participation from the Donors' Community&#13;
partly fails to materialize, the scope of the project will be adjusted downwards to match available&#13;
resources. As the bulk of the project is made up of smal subcomponents providing flexibility in&#13;
implementation such that the project can be easily adjusted; and (v) failure in providing&#13;
counterpart funds, mainly for maintenance. Clear targets and vigorous supervision wil be needed&#13;
to manage these risks.&#13;
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
112. During negotiations, the following matters were discussed and agreed with the Borrower&#13;
and the Entities, as respect to the Project investment component:&#13;
(i) The creation of a Federation Road Directorate;&#13;
(ii) Each Entity Government has committed itself to allocate in 1997 about US$15 million&#13;
to road maintenance activities;&#13;
(iii) Lending and onlending arrangements;&#13;
(iv) PIDs Terms of Reference and staffing;&#13;
(v) Procurement arrangements; and&#13;
(vi) Financial and Audit arrangements;&#13;
113. Conditions of effbctiveness and disbursement would be: (i) execution of the Project&#13;
Agreement on behalf of the Administrator and an Entity; (ii) execution of the Subsidiary Credit&#13;
Agreement on behalf of the Borrower and the Entity; and (iii) receipt of legal opinions that both&#13;
the Project Agreement and the Subsidiary Credit Agreement have been duly executed and are&#13;
legally binding upon the parties.&#13;
114. By reaching the above agreements, the Project would be suitable for a SDR 28.2 million&#13;
(US$39 million equivalent) Credit under the standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, to the&#13;
Borrower.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Second Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
Project Implementation Directorates&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Large-scale damage occurred as a result of the hostilities. Transport links leading&#13;
to or near confrontation lines suffered the most extensive destruction. Over 2,000 km of&#13;
the main road network were in need of immediate repair. Seventy bridges were damaged;&#13;
all bridges comecting Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia were destroyed; no&#13;
infrastructure maintenance had been carried out during four years; most of the railway&#13;
lines were inoperable; Sarajevo Airport was pauly destroyed and closed to regular civilian&#13;
traffic; public transport vehicles and installations were danaged or run down. Transport&#13;
institutions lost premises, records, staid funds and, in many instances, did not have access&#13;
to those parts of the system which remained operable. Moreover, the sector institutions&#13;
were forcibly fiagnented and communication was severed among them.&#13;
2.    Since the end of hostilities, the condition of the transport infratructre has&#13;
significantly improved, mainly through the implementation of the Emergency Transport&#13;
Reconstruction Project (ETRP) ' and IFOR activities to restore strategic inrastructure.&#13;
Road and railway links have been gradually restored in much of the country. Road traffic&#13;
on part of the main network has already reached prewar levels. The Sarajevo-Ploce and&#13;
the Bosanski Novi (Novi Grad) - Tuzla railway lines have been reopened to minimal&#13;
standards but no commercial trains are yet running. A few civilian charter flights are now&#13;
serving Sarajevo Airport, and public transportation companies are progressively resuming&#13;
their activities.&#13;
3.    Major transportation bottlenecks remain, however. In the road sector, more than&#13;
half of the main network still needs to be rehbed. Road maintenance needs to be&#13;
undertaken urgently to avoid further rapid deterioration of iacu  and maintenance&#13;
organizations need to be organized and equipped. In the railway sector, the economicaly&#13;
important part of the network has been restored to minimal standards, but operating&#13;
agreements and further rehabilitation are needed before commercial trains can run&#13;
regularly. In particular, signaling and telecommunications systems have to be restored to&#13;
ensure safety. Extensive work is still required on Sarajevo Airport to accommodate&#13;
The ETRP secured funding of about US$145 million fiom over 20 donors, including IDA which&#13;
provided a credit of USS35 million, of which 68% has been dibured so far.&#13;

regular trffic. Public transport systems wiD continue to require a considerable level of&#13;
assistance in the years to come.&#13;
4.    As part of the World Bank's assistance strategy for the reconstruction of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina, a Transport Reconstruction Program was prepared in December 1995&#13;
and continuously updated since, which requires total commitments of US$583 nillion as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* In 1996, US$192 million was committed, including US$145 million for the ETRP;&#13;
* In 1997, US$175 million is required for the proposed Second Emergency Transport&#13;
Reconstruction Project (SETRP);&#13;
* In 1998 and 1999 about US$216 million wil be needed.&#13;
Second Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project&#13;
5.    Bosnia and Herzegovina is the Borrower of the IDA MIT) Credit. The IDA (ITF)&#13;
Credit is to be implemented through two Project Implementation Directorates (PIDs) one&#13;
in each Entity. Cofinanciers would have the possibility to use, after agreement with the&#13;
relevant government, the PIDs to implement their respective parts of the Project. The&#13;
PIDs would be responsible to coordinate and provide assistance in the overall&#13;
mplementation of the Projet. On the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Program&#13;
anent Advisor, as defined in 1996 under the ETRP, as well as his two deputies,&#13;
one in each Entity, would continue in assisting the respective ministries in their relations&#13;
with the donor community.&#13;
PmDs Taus of Reference&#13;
6.    The PIDs will have the primary implemenation responsibilities of the IDA-&#13;
financed part of the SETRP. The PIDs will also provide liaison with donors, ministries&#13;
and other public entities on project activities. Such liaison will include facilitating the&#13;
inteaction of concerned agencies and the provision of information as described in&#13;
paragraph 7 (iv) below. In this regard, the PlDs will be the consolidated repository for&#13;
project information and data which it will make available to concerned parties in&#13;
appropriate format.&#13;

of withdrawal applications and the collection, maintenance of all relevant documents. The&#13;
Disbursement Handbook which details disbursement procedures for International&#13;
Development Association Credits, provides information on procedures and should be&#13;
considered a part of these Terms of Reference. The documents to support the&#13;
expenditures will be retained by the PIDs for at least one year after the receipt by IDA of&#13;
the audit report (see paragraph 7 (iii) below) for the year in which the last disbursement&#13;
was made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and the&#13;
Bank upon request.&#13;
(iii) Monitoring, and accounting: The PIDs will establish a management information&#13;
sem, which will cover inter alia: (a) procurement activities for works, goods and&#13;
services, (b) all financial activities including payments and disbursements; (c) project&#13;
preparation and progress; and (d) an accounting system following generally accepted&#13;
intenational standards in order to provide information on the receipt and use of funds and&#13;
in line with the Credit Agreemt. The system would ensure timely and accurate&#13;
accounting of all transactions under the Entity respective part of the Credit, and a clear&#13;
presentation of financial information. It should enable identification of the use of all funds&#13;
by components and categories. The accountng system should reflect the movement and&#13;
receipts and payments through the Special Account with balances agreed with monthly&#13;
financial statements from the bank where the Special Account would be opened and with&#13;
periodic statements from IA. The accounting system will be reviewed by auditors to be&#13;

            The Second Emergency Transport
            Reconstruction Project has several main objectives: a)
            supporting fiscal and trade reforms; b) rehabilitation of
            the primary transport network country wide; and c)
            reconstruction of the remaining key transport links with the
            rest of Europe. The project consists of two components. The
            adjustment component will support macroeconomic policy
            reforms. The transport investment component will: a) carry
            out maintenance and reconstruction on the most critical
            parts of the transportation networks; b) supply equipment to
            restart transport operations; and c) ensure the
            sustainability of reconstruction activities by strengthening
            local institution and taking proper organizational measures
            to ensure operations efficiency.
