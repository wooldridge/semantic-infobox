The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby&#13;
submits its report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the&#13;
proposal that the Bank grant to the State of Rio Grande do Sul (the Borrower) a loan in an&#13;
amount of two hundred and eighty million Dollars ($280,000,000), which loan is to be&#13;
guaranteed by the Federative Republic of Brazil. The purpose of said loan is to improve the&#13;
Borrower's capacity to mitigate economic volatility by supporting measures to increase&#13;
resources available to the Borrower and to reinforce the integrated water resource management&#13;
framework.&#13;
1.   The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of&#13;
the purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.   The Committee is of the opinion that the Program toward the financing of which the&#13;
proceeds of such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth&#13;
in Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said Program is designed to promote&#13;
the development of the productive facilities and resources of the Federative Republic of&#13;
Brazil and is in the interest of the Federative Republic of Brazil and of the members of the&#13;
Bank as a whole.&#13;
