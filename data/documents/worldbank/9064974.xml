            This note is based on a World Bank Group
            database that uses transaction values as a proxy for
            measuring privatization trends. It includes only the values
            resulting from the full or partial sale, concession, lease,
            or initial public offering of existing state owned
            enterprises or other government assets. An update of the
            World Bank Group's Privatization Database shows that
            privatizations in developing countries amounted to US$70
            billion in 2006 or US$105 billion including two mega Chinese
            offerings. Both results beat all previous years in nominal
            terms. Contrary to popular perceptions of a slowdown, the
            data show that privatization in its various forms continued
            in a broad range of countries and sectors, particularly
            infrastructure and banking. Initial public offerings were
            prominent, especially in China.
