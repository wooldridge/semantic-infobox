including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;

exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;

procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is&#13;

total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant Agreements that have been fully countersigned&#13;
on or prior to the Calculation Date (the "Cumulative Grant Total"). The calculated fee shall depend on&#13;
where the Cumulative Grant Total stands as the Grant Amount is added and shall be determined in&#13;
