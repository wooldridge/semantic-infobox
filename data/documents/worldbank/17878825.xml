                     We will turn now to Item No. 3 on the agenda, a&#13;
&#13;
           proposed loan to the Ivory Coast in the amount of $11 million&#13;
&#13;
           for an educational project.   Here I will ask Mr. Bazin&#13;
                                                  /.&#13;
           of the West African Department to tr~re to the table and&#13;
&#13;
           introduce it to you.&#13;
&#13;
                     Good morning,sir,&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. BAZIN:   Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Chairman, Members of the Board:&#13;
&#13;
                     Following a road project in 1968 and an oil palm&#13;
&#13;
           and coconut development project in 1969, this education&#13;
&#13;
           project would be the third Bank operation in the Ivory Coast.&#13;
&#13;
           The project has two noteworthy features.    For the first&#13;
&#13;
           time the Bank would be directly involved in the field of&#13;
&#13;
           primary education and also, for the first time, the Bank would&#13;
&#13;
           participate in the financing of instructional television.&#13;
&#13;
                     The Ivory Coast provides particularly justified&#13;
&#13;
           grounds for these innovations.   The reason is that the&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                  28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           country has achieved remarkable economic performance since&#13;
&#13;
           independence in 1960.   The development of human resources,&#13;
&#13;
           however, has not followed the same pace. In fact, economic&#13;
&#13;
           growth has been at an annual average rate of 8 percent,&#13;
&#13;
           exports have more than doubled, and GDP per capita reached&#13;
           $280 in 1968.&#13;
&#13;
                     However, immigrants so far have provided a large&#13;
&#13;
           part of the skilled labor.     More than 5,000 expatriates&#13;
&#13;
           hold positions in the public or semi-public sectors alone,&#13;
&#13;
           and in the private sector about 90 percent of the professionals&#13;
&#13;
           and 70 percent of the technicians are also expatriates.&#13;
&#13;
                     No doubt the number of qualified Ivorians at all leve s&#13;
&#13;
           have increased in the last few years, but the demand for them&#13;
&#13;
           has increased even more.     This trend is likely to continue&#13;
&#13;
           during the 1971-65 period, when total investment is expected&#13;
&#13;
           to be almost 50 percent higher than the average over the&#13;
           last few years.&#13;
&#13;
                     The shortage of skilled nationals has therefore&#13;
&#13;
           ecome a critical problem for the country and unfortunately&#13;
&#13;
           he present educational system has not proven able to remedy&#13;
           his situation.&#13;

                     Primary education has continued to prepare primary&#13;

           school leavers exclusively for secondary school entrance&#13;
&#13;
           and for white collar jobs. In so doing it has failed to respon&#13;
&#13;
           to the real needs of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
                     It has even greatly contributed to unemployment&#13;
&#13;
           or underemployment and by alienating young people from their&#13;
&#13;
           local culture and environment, it has accelerated urbanization&#13;
&#13;
           particularly in the capital Abidjan:   during the last three&#13;
&#13;
           years, about 135,000 persons have increased the number&#13;
&#13;
           of unemployed in urban areas.   The most important&#13;
&#13;
           component of these persons consists of primary school leavers.&#13;
&#13;
           Each year 45,000 you,people leave primary school without&#13;
&#13;
           any desire to find employment in their own village.     Many&#13;
&#13;
           of them go to the town where their hopes of finding jobs&#13;
&#13;
           and participating in their country's economic achievements&#13;
&#13;
           are very often disappointed.&#13;
&#13;
                     The Government is aware of these shortcomings and&#13;
&#13;
           has drawn up a long-term educational program based on a new&#13;
&#13;
           policy.   The main objectives of this policy are to improve&#13;
&#13;
           the efficiency of the system and to expand the output&#13;
&#13;
           of technical, vocational, agricultural education; and at the&#13;
&#13;
           secondary and post-secondary levels.&#13;
&#13;
                     As regards primary education, the program provides&#13;
&#13;
           for the introduction of television which will be associated&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           with new teaching techniques and curriculum reform.       It is&#13;
&#13;
           expected that this new important step should succeed in&#13;
&#13;
           providing the country and its economy with human resources&#13;
&#13;
           more adapted to present and future needs.       The lessons which&#13;
&#13;
           will emerge from this first national ITV program should be&#13;
&#13;
           of great importance to the Bank and to other developing&#13;
&#13;
           countries.    This is the main reason why the Bank felt justifie&#13;
&#13;
           in participating in this first international effort.&#13;
&#13;
                        I would like to point out thattn order not to&#13;
&#13;
           delay the implementation of this project any further,&#13;
&#13;
           it was decided in agreement with the Government to make the&#13;
&#13;
           signing of the management consultants' contract a condition&#13;
&#13;
           of effectiveness instead of a condition of signing of the&#13;
&#13;
           proposed loan.     The legal documents have been amended accord-&#13;

                        Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

                        MR. McNAMARA:   Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                        Gentlemen, may I have your comments or&#13;
&#13;
           questions?&#13;
&#13;
                        Mr. Plescoff and then Mr. Lynch.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. PLESCOFF: Mr. Chairman, I thank the staff&#13;
&#13;
           for the very interesting expose which has been made, and I&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY    ONFIDENTIAL                                                   31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           think this is a very interesting case, but first, Ivory Coast&#13;
&#13;
           is the country which is growing the fastest in West Africa&#13;
&#13;
           and has a record of achievement in the economic field,&#13;
&#13;
           and I must say that I should have known, but I was amazed to&#13;
&#13;
           read in the report that only 9 percent of the population&#13;
&#13;
           is literate.   It is really surprising that a country with&#13;
&#13;
           only 9 percent of the population literate, could achieve what&#13;
&#13;
           they have achieved up to now, and I feel sure that the need&#13;
&#13;
           for education is really the first need in a country which&#13;
&#13;
           has succeeded in the economy and even in the industrial&#13;
&#13;
           field, not only in agriculture.   I think this is a very importa t&#13;
&#13;
           characteristic of the presentation which has been made.&#13;
&#13;
                      I support this loan not only because I represent&#13;
&#13;
           France which is helping the Ivory Coast in this, but not&#13;
&#13;
           enough as we can see, because the literacy is not sufficient,&#13;
&#13;
           but also because I was a teacher and I have been a student&#13;
&#13;
           in a training college, and I was glad to see that the training&#13;
&#13;
           college is an important part of the program because this is&#13;
&#13;
           where we can help at the lowest cost the Ivory Coast to produce&#13;
&#13;
           teachers who would be able to increase the education in the&#13;
&#13;
           country.&#13;
&#13;
                      The modern feature of TV is also a very interesting&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         32&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           one.   I understand it's one of the first experiments in that&#13;
&#13;
           field, and it would be very interesting to follow the&#13;
&#13;
           technical difficulties and the results and best return we can&#13;
&#13;
           have in education through TV because it avoids having a&#13;
&#13;
           great number of teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                     I have just one technical question in that field.&#13;
&#13;
           I'd like to know if the staff has studied if it is only by&#13;
&#13;
           TV emission that this would be done or if in the future&#13;
&#13;
           there would not be some kind of cassette which could be sent&#13;
&#13;
           to the villages to be used instead of emission.      I wonder&#13;
&#13;
           if that step has also been studied.&#13;
&#13;
                     Anyway, I'm glad of this loan.      I support it.&#13;
&#13;
                     I also have one question. It's that Ivory Coast is&#13;
&#13;
           only receiving a Bank loan for education, and there's no&#13;
&#13;
           blend contract with IDA.     I would like to have a comparison&#13;
&#13;
           of the situation of income per head in the Ivory Coast and in&#13;
&#13;
           other countries which have received blend contracts with IDA,&#13;
&#13;
           to know if we're not unfair to the Ivory Coast, which has such&#13;
&#13;
           big important expenditures to make, by giving only a high-cost&#13;
&#13;
           Bank loan for education.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:     Thank you.   Let's take them one at&#13;
&#13;
           a time, the two questions.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         33&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    First, with respect to the possible use of film&#13;
&#13;
           ersus live TV, Mr. Bazin, would you like to answer that or&#13;
&#13;
           o you wish&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. BAZIN:   Mr. Lethem will answer that.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA: Mr. Lethem will comment on that.&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. LETHEM: This is indeed a possibility to use&#13;
&#13;
           alternative ways to reach pupils in schools than by television.&#13;
&#13;
           By "cassette" I would assume that you mean especially&#13;
&#13;
           video tapes which can be projected in the classroom.     In&#13;
&#13;
           the case of the Ivory Coast, it is unlikely that this system&#13;
&#13;
           will be used because the Government has a program to cover&#13;
&#13;
           through the national television system almost the whole of the&#13;
&#13;
           country's area, and therefore from a technical point of view,&#13;
&#13;
           the areas where electiricty is not available are being&#13;
&#13;
           covered by battery-operated television receivers.&#13;
&#13;
                     As far as we know, the technical studies have not&#13;
&#13;
           demonstrated the need to use video tape recorders.     The out-&#13;
&#13;
           lying areas which would have necessitated it might also have&#13;
&#13;
           been difficult to reach in terms of transportation of the&#13;
&#13;
           tapes, and the solution of beaming the programs appears more&#13;
&#13;
           economical.&#13;
&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA: And now the second question on the&#13;
&#13;
           allocation of IDA funds, I think perhaps we can best answer th t,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          34&#13;
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         r. Plescoff, by sending you a technical note on the subject,&#13;
&#13;
         end it to all the members of the Board, showing the distribu-&#13;
&#13;
         ion of IDA.   The fact is we lack adequate IDA funds to meet&#13;
&#13;
                  of all countries that might qualify on a basis&#13;
&#13;
         f income per capita for IDA.   In the case of the Ivory Coast,&#13;
&#13;
         f course, the debt service charges are not now high.    They are&#13;
&#13;
        not nearly as high as debt service charges in other countries&#13;
&#13;
        with comparable per capita income.   Quite frankly, that is&#13;
&#13;
        the reason why other countries and not Ivory coast are&#13;
&#13;
        receiving either IDA credits or blends of credits and loans.&#13;
&#13;
        But I'll be very happy to expand on that answer with a technica&#13;
&#13;
        note to the members of the Board.    I'll ask Mr.Cope to follow&#13;
&#13;
        that and take care of it.&#13;
&#13;
                  Mr. Lynch.&#13;
&#13;
                  MR. LYNCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                  I think this is an extremely carefully thought out&#13;
&#13;
        intricate and balanced project, and if I may say so, strikingly&#13;
&#13;
        presented this morning.&#13;
&#13;
                  It comprehends major and fundamental reforms at&#13;
&#13;
        primary and secondary and tertiary levels, all three.&#13;
&#13;
                  I too agree very much with its vocational bias,&#13;
&#13;
        particularly at the primary level.    I believe that every&#13;

           that while there are of course higher aims of education&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  ! I . think&#13;
           for the individual, for development of the individual, .&#13;
&#13;
           that these are more and not less likely to be achieved in the&#13;
&#13;
           longer term if the elementary requirement of a root in national&#13;
&#13;
           need is there at the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
                       I therefore have no quarrel with the ultimate&#13;
&#13;
           objectives of this project and very little with its structure.&#13;
&#13;
           I do see, however, in the report that it has been a long time&#13;
&#13;
           evolving.   There was an IBRD-UNESCO-FAO mission in January&#13;
&#13;
           1967, a Bank-UNESCO mission in May 1968, and still even after&#13;
&#13;
           that, the IBRD appraisal mission in the spring of last year&#13;
&#13;
           found it necessary to make apparently quite big modifications&#13;
&#13;
           in the proposals as they had evolved that far.&#13;
&#13;
                       This is rather long gestation for the project, and&#13;
&#13;
           even though obviously a very profound change implied by this&#13;
&#13;
           proposal will take a long time to work out, I think that&#13;
&#13;
           this is really a little too long and is illustrative of the&#13;
&#13;
           need which we have seen recently in the Jackson report&#13;
&#13;
           of a more integrated and faster moving UN development system&#13;
&#13;
            hich comprehends the maximum IBRD involvement at the earliest&#13;
&#13;
           stages.&#13;
&#13;
                       There is, though, one feature of the project which&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     36&#13;

&#13;
           has been welcomed by Mr. Plescoff as it has eventually been&#13;
&#13;
           brought forward on which I must confess to some reservation.&#13;
&#13;
           I must admit at the beginning to a considerable distrust of&#13;
&#13;
           television as a means of instruction. I think that by its very&#13;
&#13;
           nature the medium tends to be ephemeral and impressionistic&#13;
&#13;
           and if, as Mr. Plescoff hopes, it is eventually to displace&#13;
&#13;
           teachers, then I think that one comes up at that stage against&#13;
&#13;
           a further grave disadvantage in the lack of a stimulus of&#13;
&#13;
           individual personality on the student, which I think is&#13;
&#13;
           terribly important, even where the main aim of the primary stag&#13;
&#13;
           anyway is vocational.&#13;
&#13;
                     The system has been operating, I see in the report,&#13;
&#13;
           in Niger for three years. I think probably this is the first&#13;
&#13;
           experiment of the kind in a less developed country, and I think&#13;
&#13;
           it is implicit in the report that it hasn't been in operation&#13;
&#13;
           long enough there for firm conclusions to be drawn as to the&#13;
&#13;
           value of this form of instruction in the context of a less&#13;
&#13;
           developed country, but it may be that in more advanced&#13;
&#13;
           countries there has been in operation for a sufficiently long&#13;
&#13;
            ime a system of television instruction which would enable&#13;
&#13;
            s to arrive at some conclusions as to its value or otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
                     Furthermore, I wonder in the context of   ~er   how muc&#13;
&#13;
            f the benefit has been due to television as such and how much&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            37&#13;

             it is due to parallel reforms of curricula and new teaching&#13;
&#13;
             methods, which I am glad to hear are to accompany the&#13;
&#13;
             introduction of television in the Ivory Coast.&#13;
&#13;
                         I think I would have been rather happier if the&#13;
&#13;
             !TV component of this project had not been so central to it&#13;
&#13;
             but had rather, as in Niger I believe, been more in the nature&#13;
&#13;
             of an experiment.&#13;

                         Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

                         MR. McNAMARA: Thank you, Mr. Lynch.&#13;
&#13;
                         Let me ask Mr.Ballantine to comment initially on&#13;
&#13;
             this and he might ask some members of his staff to expand&#13;
&#13;
             on his comments, and I may add some afterwards.&#13;
&#13;
                         Go right ahead.&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. BALLANTINE:   Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, on&#13;
&#13;
             the first point I noted that Mr. Lynch has raised the lack of&#13;
&#13;
             stimulus in the educational TV system.     I take it your&#13;
&#13;
             feeling is that there's a rather passive role played by the&#13;
&#13;
             students.    I might say that one of the bits of experience that&#13;
&#13;
             we have observed which was also raised by Mr. Lynch is&#13;
&#13;
             out here at Hagerstown, Maryland, where a large number of our&#13;
&#13;
             staff have visited.    I have been there myself and sat in a&#13;
&#13;
             classroom while this process is going on.     It is not passive.&#13;
&#13;
             The program is arranged so that at intervals the studio&#13;
                              I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        1&#13;
&#13;
        I.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       38&#13;

&#13;
           eacher will pause and the classroom teacher will then take&#13;
                                               ~&#13;
           ver and the studio teacher will haveposed a question and the&#13;
                                               I&#13;
           tudents will he asked to discuss it for a period of five minute&#13;
&#13;
           r so, and there was certainly nothing passive in the way that&#13;
&#13;
           hose students responded.&#13;
&#13;
                    I might add also that sitting in the back of the room&#13;
&#13;
           t was clear that the demonstration--this was in sixth grade&#13;
&#13;
           cience -- that was conducted was obviously much more visible&#13;
&#13;
           o all the members of the class than it would have been had it&#13;
&#13;
           een conducted in live form at the front of the classroom.&#13;
&#13;
                    On the question of the experience that we have had&#13;
&#13;
                    observe on this, I would like to cite four cases from&#13;
&#13;
           mong very many.   The first is actually 23 cases, which were&#13;
&#13;
                   in a study by the International Institute of Educationa&#13;
&#13;
           lanning in Paris and published in three volumes called "New&#13;
&#13;
                   Message to Educators."   These 23 cases were both in&#13;
&#13;
           eveloped and developing countries, and they illustrated&#13;
&#13;
                  and failure.   I regard it as one of the most valuable&#13;
&#13;
                  or volumes to introduce oneto the subject of educational&#13;
&#13;
               I'd be very happy if members of the Board wished, to try to&#13;
&#13;
                  to have copies of that distributed to everyone because&#13;
&#13;
            think it's for all of us a good start on our own education in&#13;
&#13;
            is field.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                 39&#13;

&#13;
                                       Going back to the Hagerstown case, this is perhaps&#13;
&#13;
           one of the cases where there is really hard evaluative&#13;
&#13;
           evidence.                    Hagerstown in most subject areas, until the beginnin&#13;
&#13;
           of this experiment, was a mediocre educational syst,m.p,sed&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
           i~       :&lt;;&gt;n a national basis.                 It stood either at about            th~&#13;

&#13;
           m~ddle           percentile or in a few cases, a little                       belo~'t.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       After the experiment had about five or six                    ye.~rs,          its&#13;
&#13;
           positJon had risen up, I believe, to the top quartil, ,in all&#13;

                Â·!:.- ';&#13;
                         subject areas, and it was quite clear that with the same&#13;

           inputs except for the adoption of TV, they would                                  nQ~ ~~~e&#13;

&#13;
                  MR. McNAMARA:     And Mr. Lynch, I am sure you noticed&#13;
&#13;
         n the Appraisal Report, therefore, quite a wide range of&#13;
&#13;
         otential development of this between now and 1980, a high figu e&#13;
&#13;
         hat is four or five times the level of the low objective,&#13;
&#13;
         nd the exact point in the range at which the system will&#13;
&#13;
         ventually move toward will depend upon the success of the&#13;
&#13;
        'nitial experiment.     That's one of the reasons why the project&#13;
&#13;
         as taken as long as it has to prepare.     Initially, the costs&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          41&#13;

           were far in excess of potential benefits and it is only after&#13;
&#13;
           it has been worked and re-worked that we think we have a progr&#13;
&#13;
           that is satisfactory in terms of both quality and cost.&#13;
&#13;
                     I think it is a very, very worthwhile experiment,&#13;
&#13;
           and absolutely fascinating one.   I do very much share&#13;
&#13;
           your own skepticism about mechanical aids substituting for&#13;
&#13;
           quality of teaching. ABout once a month a visitor comes to my&#13;
&#13;
           office to try to convince me we should finance a satellite&#13;
&#13;
           communication system or nationwide TV system or something of&#13;
&#13;
           that kind, and the point that Mr. Plescoff raised is a pertinen&#13;
&#13;
           one.   I always ask him, well, what are they going to put into&#13;
&#13;
           this satellite.   The satellite or TV is nothing more&#13;
&#13;
           than a wire or a substitute for a wire, and the important&#13;
&#13;
           question is what goes in one end and what comes out the other,&#13;
&#13;
           and is what comes out properly adjusted to the requirement&#13;
&#13;
           of the students, and here there has been a tremendous attention&#13;
&#13;
           given to exactly that input and output.   Frankly, the TV&#13;
&#13;
           mechanism which attracts the attention and interest of most&#13;
&#13;
           readers is really a relatively insignificant part   ~f   it.&#13;
&#13;
           It is the effort to address thefpint that shocked Mr. Plescoff&#13;
&#13;
            r surprised him, which surprised me equally, 9 percent&#13;
&#13;
           literacy in that nation.   That's the basic problem and the&#13;
&#13;
            overnment is addressing it and using this as a tool to move&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              42&#13;

           that literacy rate up, and it's the most efficient one&#13;
&#13;
           they feel available to them.&#13;
&#13;
                       I am sure this Board will be as interested as I&#13;
&#13;
           am going to be over the years ahead, to see how this&#13;
&#13;
           progresses, and it will be a year or two or three before we ar&#13;
&#13;
           prepared to report to you, but we will do so.&#13;
&#13;
                       Mr. Lynch.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. LYNCH: I am deeply grateful for the explanation,&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, and I'm glad to hear even yourself say that it&#13;
&#13;
           is essential for this to be treated as an aid.       I still have s me&#13;
&#13;
           residual skepticism, perhaps from a Marshall McLuhan type&#13;
&#13;
           of feeling that the medium tends to be the message.&#13;
&#13;
                       (Laughter)&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:     Well, if it does, it fails certainly&#13;
&#13;
           in this case.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. LYNCH: Yes.     I'll watch it with interest, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:     Dr. Chen.&#13;
&#13;
                       DR. CHEN:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                       I would like to give my warm support to this project&#13;
&#13;
           Like Mr. Plescoff, I was really shocked by this low literacy&#13;
&#13;
           rate of approximately 9 percent and correspondingly only&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     43&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         20 percent of the technical supervisory and professional worker&#13;
&#13;
         are Ivorians, which means a very large percentage of   ~xpatriate   .&#13;
&#13;
         For all these reasons, I believe this is certainly a very&#13;
&#13;
         sound project and will fulfill the need of the country.&#13;
&#13;
                   On~be positive side, I must say that the Government&#13;
&#13;
         of Ivory Coast has done very well in the last decade since&#13;
&#13;
         its independence in 1960, resulting in the average growth&#13;
&#13;
         rate of about 7 percent over a three-year period between&#13;
&#13;
         1966 and 1968.&#13;
&#13;
                   Speaking of their foreign exchange reserves, it&#13;
&#13;
         has reversed from the past trend of deficit into $36~1/2&#13;
&#13;
          illion in 1968.   In fact, stated in your report, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
          aragraph 10, this $36-1/2 million in reserves represents&#13;
&#13;
          ractically three months' imports.   It means that the Ivory&#13;
&#13;
          oast now owns over half of the net foreign assets of the&#13;
&#13;
          even-member West African Monetary Union.&#13;
&#13;
                   All in all, I must say that the economic performance&#13;
&#13;
          f Ivory Coast is excellent, although there are other short-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   I welcome especially the innovation of this TV&#13;
&#13;
          ducational program, as so well told by Mr. Ballantine.     The&#13;
&#13;
          uccess of the TV education program or education facilities&#13;
&#13;
          re beyond doubt, in other words, and I believe that in course&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY    ONFIDENTIAL                                                  44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            f time, the television program will greatly contribute to&#13;
&#13;
           the solution of skilled manpower shorta9es in the Ivory&#13;
&#13;
           Coast.&#13;
                     Finally I note with gratification that the Govern-&#13;
&#13;
           ment of Ivory Coast is increasing its expenditure on&#13;
&#13;
           education on the recurrent items, and I also, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
           welcome the very generous terms, 30 years' amortization with&#13;
&#13;
           ten years' grace, although I too am inclined to agree with Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Plescoff, I wish it could have been a sort of blend of&#13;
&#13;
           loan and IDA credit.   There must be good reason to the&#13;
&#13;
           contrary, as we may see in your paper later.&#13;
&#13;
                     Finally, I have one question to ask, which has alread&#13;
&#13;
           been explained by you in part. I notice in your report,&#13;
&#13;
           paragraph 3, negotiations were held here at the end of&#13;
&#13;
           September through October 7.   It is almost six months since&#13;
&#13;
           then, and now it has come Â· to the Board. I would like to know th&#13;
&#13;
           reason which accounts for this long delay, other than that we&#13;
&#13;
           had to go over these cost figures.   My question leads to a&#13;
&#13;
           rather specific problem, whether these problems could be&#13;
&#13;
           negotiated out during the neqotiations or do we have to wait&#13;
&#13;
           as Â· long as six months before it comes to the Board?&#13;
                     MR. McNAMARA:   MR. Lethem, would you comment on that,&#13;
&#13;
           please?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             45 .&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. LETHEM:   We felt during negotiations and&#13;
&#13;
           before presenting the ioan for signing, that there would be&#13;
&#13;
           a signed contract between the Government and the architect-&#13;
&#13;
           consultants who are in charge of implementation of the whole&#13;
&#13;
           program. We had been given to understand                du~nq        negotiations&#13;
&#13;
           that such contract would take aÂ· little time'to, finalize.&#13;
&#13;
           In fact, it did take more than expected.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAMARA:   Mr. Hanemann.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. HANEMANN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                        I would like to make some comments and I have some&#13;
&#13;
           questions.     It is stated here, and we have heard it also&#13;
&#13;
           repeated by the staff that this is the first direct involve-&#13;
&#13;
           ment in the field of primary education through this ITV&#13;
&#13;
           element.     Of courset Mr. Chairman, one could look at the&#13;
&#13;
           matter, at this ITV element, as a kind of replacement ~f&#13;
&#13;
           teacher training in wbioh the Bank Group has already been&#13;
&#13;
           involved on various occasions.      Practically the TV is to some&#13;
&#13;
           extent replacing some teacher training, but if we look at&#13;
&#13;
           it ; as was said, as a first involvement, direct                     invol~e~ent&#13;
&#13;
            ib the field of primary education, and not as a kind of&#13;
&#13;
            replacement of teacher training, the question comes up of&#13;
&#13;
            c~';lr~~ to what extent the World Bank Group could Â·~~c~nto&#13;
&#13;
            t~i~h~ ield   of giving assistance to primary educatf~~Â·&#13;
                                                                           ..    .   â&#128;¢   I&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      We   ha~   already taken over responsibilities in the&#13;
&#13;
           field of industrial training, vocational training, agricultural&#13;
&#13;
           training, secondary training, teacher training, and I wonder&#13;
           whether the management has already some concept to what&#13;
&#13;
           extent it could in addition to this educational training&#13;
&#13;
           enter into an involvement in the primary education, because&#13;
&#13;
           resources are limited for financing primary education or&#13;
&#13;
           giving assistance to primary education through World Bank loans ,&#13;
&#13;
           which is very expensive financing for the countries concerned.&#13;
&#13;
           Our IDA resources are limited, so we have to be selective&#13;
&#13;
           to some extent.       We cannot do everything.&#13;
&#13;
                        I wonder to what extent the management intends&#13;
&#13;
           to go to become involved, directly involved in primary&#13;
&#13;
           edUcation, because I think the needs in this field are' enormous&#13;
&#13;
           arldc the resources are of course limited, so this woiilli!lbe&#13;
&#13;
           a g~h~tal question whether it's already possible         t6    qf~! some&#13;

                        The second question, Mr. Chairman, refers .     or&#13;
                                                                           the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           ssistance element is presented.    Here the World Bank is&#13;
&#13;
           repared to finance technical assistance in order to avoid&#13;
&#13;
            survey of method to improve utilization of existing secondary&#13;
&#13;
                   including setting up model timetables, or planning&#13;
&#13;
           tudies of vocational education, or explaining the    ~upervieion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           f teachers of science, and so on, and I wonder to what extent&#13;
&#13;
           he efforts in this field are a matter of World Bank financing&#13;
&#13;
             ~~ther this also is not more a matter for UNESCO.       It&#13;
&#13;
             probably difficult to draw a borderline between the activiti s&#13;
&#13;
             the two institutions in this field, but I would be happy&#13;
&#13;
             I could hear a little bit about the way in which this&#13;
&#13;
           echnical assistance to elaborate the setting up of model&#13;
&#13;
            imetables and curricula--how   cooperation~d   coordination with&#13;
&#13;
            ESCO has worked out, and what are the intentions of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
           Group to enter these fields or to leave this matter to UNESCO.&#13;
&#13;
                    The third question, Mr.Chairman, refers to the&#13;
&#13;
           reception network which has finally to be established in order&#13;
&#13;
           to make this production center useable.   I read in paragraph&#13;
&#13;
           3.16 of the Appraisal that the Government of Ivory Coast&#13;
&#13;
           has agreed that it will execute by 1980 a program to provide&#13;
&#13;
           at least 2,860 classrooms with ITV.   Now, when one looks at the&#13;
&#13;
           diagram in   Annex 13, and you touched upon this already, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Chairman, I believe that the establishment of TV's in classroom&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        48&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           up to 1980, with 2,860 classrooms to be provided with TV's&#13;
&#13;
           that is a relatively small part of what is mentioned here&#13;
&#13;
           as the maximum or the Government request.              It seems&#13;
&#13;
           to indicate that what the Government requested, the Ivory&#13;
&#13;
           Coast Government, was interested in having all this reception&#13;
&#13;
           network implemented, financed by the Bank, but the Bank felt&#13;
&#13;
           that this was not a matter for the Bank to do; it was a matter&#13;
&#13;
           for the Government.              But even in the course of ten years'&#13;
&#13;
           time, until 1980, there seems now to be rather broad gap betwe&#13;
&#13;
           that which is intended to be done or agreed to be done by&#13;
&#13;
           the Ivory Coast Government and what the Ivory Coast Government&#13;
&#13;
           had in mind when it made a request.              At least, it seems&#13;
&#13;
           as       though~       there was a question raised whether by&#13;
&#13;
           1980, there couldn't already be installed TV's in 50,000&#13;
&#13;
           classrooms, so I would be happy if I could get some informatio&#13;
&#13;
           about the way in which this matter had been discussed with the&#13;
&#13;
           I!~f.~            Coast Government, and what has been the   reason , ~s~&#13;

           classrooms until 1980, with TV reception network.                 In fact,&#13;
&#13;
           if one looks at the minimum borderline under IBRD analysis&#13;
&#13;
           in the diagram in Annex 13, it seems that much more could be&#13;

           done, or could~ve been done.&#13;
&#13;
                       It might well be that due to the fact that it is&#13;
&#13;
           to some extent still an experiment, one was reluctant&#13;
&#13;
           to go beyond this limit of 2,860 classrooms, but on the other&#13;
&#13;
           hand, we heard from the staff that there are some positive&#13;
&#13;
           experiences made in this field, so that it seems a rather long&#13;
&#13;
           time which is lost until 1980, with only 2,860 classrooms&#13;
&#13;
           provided with television, whereas 50,000 would be needed,&#13;
&#13;
           perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
                       This is what is represented under the words "governme t&#13;

           to what extent will we become involved in financing primary&#13;
&#13;
           education?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
            ery briefly the Bank's history of the Bank policy on education&#13;
&#13;
            hen I believe it was in 1963 the Chairman first brought the&#13;
&#13;
            olicy to the Board, it stated we would support projects in&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   We have therefore stayed away from direct involvement&#13;
&#13;
            primary education.   Wemd various good reasons for this.&#13;
&#13;
           irst of all, we felt at that time that there was an excessive&#13;
&#13;
           oncentration on primary education, largely in response to&#13;
&#13;
           ocial and political pressures, at the expense of some of the&#13;
&#13;
               productive types of education, which we had been financing&#13;
&#13;
               large extent. Therefore, we should not encourage&#13;
&#13;
              borrowers to go further in this direction.&#13;
&#13;
                    Secondly, we felt that the construction of one- or&#13;
&#13;
                   schoolhouses all over a country probably did not lend i -&#13;
&#13;
           elf easily to the Bank's procedures on supervision, contracting,&#13;
&#13;
           nd so forth.&#13;
&#13;
                    The most important reason was that we were fairly&#13;
&#13;
           ~ppy about the state of primary education and its relevance&#13;
&#13;
           o the needs of the students, most of whom would never get&#13;
&#13;
           eyond primary education.&#13;
&#13;
                    Several years ago, President Nyerere produced a&#13;
&#13;
           aper called "Education for Self-reliance," in which he pointed&#13;
&#13;
           o the fact that primary education is essentially designed to&#13;
&#13;
           repare you for secondary education, and secondary education&#13;
&#13;
           s essentially designed to prepare you for the university, and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           that he felt a system ought to be at each level self-contained&#13;
&#13;
           and meaningful in itself and related to the lives of the&#13;
&#13;
           students who would go out from there.&#13;
&#13;
                      Now, there has been a broad and significant shift&#13;
&#13;
           in the philosophy of educational development, more or less&#13;
&#13;
           at this particular point in time.       The decade of the sixties&#13;
&#13;
           was a time of expansion in numbers. often at increasing expens&#13;
&#13;
           and pressure on budgets, at higher costs with lower quality,&#13;
&#13;
           with greater dependence on foreign teachers, with very little&#13;
&#13;
           attention to the quality of aspects and by quality I mean&#13;
&#13;
           not only the quality of learning but also the relevance and&#13;
&#13;
           usefulness to   a developing country.&#13;
&#13;
                      There is at present in the thinking of all of us&#13;
&#13;
           in this field, a recognition tha,probably this phase of&#13;
                                               I&#13;
           educational development is coming to an end.       There will be&#13;
&#13;
           more quantitative expansion, but the dominant emphasis,&#13;
&#13;
           as the Chairman has indicated in some of his speeches, will be&#13;
&#13;
           in the future on quality, on relevance, on economy and&#13;
&#13;
           efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
                      Now, coming back to the question of policy, we&#13;
&#13;
           r~gara   this as an exceptional case and the policy that I am&#13;
&#13;
           trying to apply under the management's direction is that we&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         52&#13;

           would engage in financing a primary education in experimental&#13;
&#13;
           projects which promise greater efficiency, economy or&#13;
&#13;
           r elevance.           We believe that this one does.      There will be&#13;
           o thers coming to the Board, increasing I think in numbers,&#13;
&#13;
           but not in a great rush all at once, but I would say that in th&#13;
&#13;
           whole area of education, two areas are emerging of increasing&#13;
&#13;
           tdgnificance and let me say first I think we 'Me paid good&#13;
&#13;
           attention within the area of formal education.                I think&#13;
&#13;
           we have made constructive loans which have helped to reform&#13;
&#13;
           and improve systems as well as to Â· expand quantity, but I&#13;
&#13;
           fel that primary education is drastically in need of change&#13;

&#13;
           out, and that           ~here   were perhaps increasing technical assistanc&#13;
&#13;
           which anticipates your second question, Mr .Hanemann, w.o lll.d it b&#13;
&#13;
           a proper role for the Bank .            The - second ~ a~a,althouqh   it is&#13;
&#13;
           beyond this question, but I'll mention, is the area of non-&#13;
&#13;
           ~rmal             education.    If you look at a developed country with a&#13;
&#13;
           school leaving age of 15, the percenta9e of children aged 6 to&#13;
&#13;
           1 5 in school runs 90 percent or more.               ~y   a very crude&#13;
&#13;
           c't$?}Hâ&#128;¢-&#13;
                   " ion, I would estimate that in            ~ica,     the percentage&#13;
           of children 6 to 15 who are in school is not more than 35&#13;
&#13;
           percent and perhaps substantially below that.                 At every   levelâ&#128;¢ ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           therefore, the system is inadequate to meet the needs.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             53&#13;

STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        If I may take just one more moment to illustrate my&#13;
&#13;
           point, in East Arrica the entering labor force in 1966&#13;
&#13;
           consisting of 500,000 people, had the following educational&#13;
&#13;
           inventory:     43 percent had had no education at all; an&#13;
&#13;
           additional 73 percent had had less than four years of&#13;
&#13;
           education; 76 percent, in other words, had had no or negligible&#13;
&#13;
           education.     This is a labor force that will   continue down&#13;
&#13;
           to theÂ·year'2000 and the inventory that the East African countrÂ·es&#13;
&#13;
           are stuck with as far as that year's entry is concerned.         It ta es&#13;
&#13;
           only simple arithmetic projecting the growth of GNP and the&#13;
&#13;
           groth of education expenditure to demonstrate that solving&#13;
&#13;
           this problem through conventional means is impossible from the&#13;
&#13;
           point of view of resources.       I think therefore that one of th&#13;
&#13;
           major tasks we have in the future will be to explore and find&#13;
&#13;
           ways to solve this problem of human resource development&#13;
&#13;
           in addition to the development of formal education systems&#13;
&#13;
           and I might say that despite some few isolated successful&#13;
&#13;
           experiments, this is a great terra incognita.      None of us&#13;
&#13;
           know very much but I would feel that it is our job as the&#13;
&#13;
           leading development finance agency in the world to tackle this&#13;
&#13;
           problem anathough we may make many mistakes, my own feeling&#13;
&#13;
           is the worst mistake we could make is to do nothing.&#13;

&#13;
             point to those he has made, what he has said -- if you&#13;
&#13;
             imagine this situation, fifty      ~ears   from now, two-thirds of&#13;
&#13;
             labor force in certain age groups, such as 50- to 60-year-&#13;
&#13;
             males in many of the Asian and most of the African&#13;
&#13;
              some of the Latin American countries, two-thirds of the&#13;
&#13;
                         will never have attended school, fifty years from n      I&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           nd at varying degrees, lesser percentages of those&#13;
&#13;
           ounger individuals fifty years from now, and this is a problem&#13;
&#13;
           e addressed, and there isn't any answer to it that we&#13;
&#13;
           now of, but it is one we will pay increasing attention to.&#13;
&#13;
                       And now, Duncan, can you move to the second question,&#13;
&#13;
           he question of technical assistance, why wouldn't it have&#13;
&#13;
           een better to finance the technical assistance referred to in t e&#13;
&#13;
           ppraisal Report, by UNESCO?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. BALLANTINE:   I   think the answer is that&#13;
&#13;
           NESCO is an implementing agency, net a financial agency.&#13;
&#13;
           ts resources are very limited, and it depends, I think, for&#13;
&#13;
           bout half of its technical assistance activities on UNDP&#13;
&#13;
           inancing.     W1have in the past tended to move alongside other&#13;
&#13;
           gencies' functions, bilateral in some cases, multilateral&#13;
&#13;
                       and link our capital financing with their technical&#13;
&#13;
           ssistance.     With our expanded program, however, we are finding&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                            55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           we are outrunning the availability of that other financing.&#13;
&#13;
           We intend wherever possible to join forces with other agencies,&#13;
&#13;
           but we feel that form the point of view of timing and volume&#13;
&#13;
           of available funds, we will have to go more deeply into the&#13;
&#13;
           financing, at least of technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                        I might say that in our lending portfolio thus&#13;
&#13;
           far, we have spent about 67 percent or 70 percent, rather, on&#13;
&#13;
           construction, about 27 percent on equipment, and less than&#13;
&#13;
           3 percent on technical assistance.      I think in view of the&#13;
&#13;
           imperatives of the new decade that I was speaking of, we&#13;
&#13;
           should expect to finance a much larger percentage in our&#13;
&#13;
           lending of technical assistance than 3 percent, although I&#13;
&#13;
           repeat we will ally with other agencies wherever that appears&#13;
&#13;
           feasible.&#13;

&#13;
           part of the comprehensive financing plan for the ITV education&#13;
&#13;
           scheme.     T~e Bank was asked to finance the construction of&#13;
&#13;

           here,          i~       how satisfactory the coverage of the country will be&#13;

&#13;
           administrative system, maintenance system, because you have&#13;
&#13;
           tp emsire that the programs are received on time, that is&#13;

           that the sets are functioning when                   needed~   also that the&#13;

&#13;
           that feedback comes from the classroom to the production cente&#13;
&#13;
           in order to improve the programs.&#13;
&#13;
                                    In view of that experimental character, we discussed&#13;

&#13;
             minimum which the Bank is asking the Government to reach.&#13;
&#13;
             Of course we expect that the minimum will be more than&#13;
&#13;
             reached by 1980 and it is very likely that the coverage will&#13;
&#13;
             be somewhere between the minimum and a maximum number,&#13;

&#13;
           and its natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
                        On the borrowing side, we have a very sizeable&#13;
&#13;
           loan from Japan, a new source of funds for the World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
           and I think it is very significant that we should have been&#13;
&#13;
           able to raise these funds at such a favorable rate, given the&#13;
&#13;
           present situation of the capital market.     I think it carries&#13;
&#13;
           the same interest as Japanese Government-guaranteed securities,&#13;
&#13;
           and this is a tremendous vote of confidence in our institution,&#13;
&#13;
           a demonstration that the creditworthiness of the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
           firmly established and will not be impaired by our decision&#13;
&#13;
           to expand the volume of our operations, and to enter into new&#13;
&#13;
           fields of activity, such as population, education, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
                        I think such an agenda gives an accurate reflection&#13;
&#13;
           of the role being assumed by the Bank increasingly as a&#13;
&#13;
           leader in development assistance.     So a few words of acknowledg&#13;
&#13;
           ment and appreciation are in order this week, since it coincide&#13;
&#13;
           with the second anniversary of your association with the Bank&#13;
&#13;
           Group.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, withzegard to the project before us, I would&#13;
&#13;
           like just briefly to say that I am pleased, very pleased that&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank has finally directly entered into the field of primary&#13;
&#13;
           education.     It is something I have advocated for quite a while,&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY    NFIDENTIAL                                                      59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           so it is very gratifying to me that our first intervention&#13;
&#13;
           in the field as represented by the Ivory Coast project,&#13;
&#13;
           would set the right pace.   It is, I believe, an outstanding&#13;
&#13;
           project as well as an experiment of the highest interest,&#13;
&#13;
           because of the possibility of implementing similar projects&#13;
&#13;
           in other developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
                     It is of course in this particular field of what&#13;
&#13;
           might be called loosely research and development in education&#13;
&#13;
           that the Bank can make the most useful contribution.      So I&#13;
&#13;
           am very happy to give my complete support to this project.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Chairman, you have already discussed at some&#13;
&#13;
           length in various public statements the current crisis in&#13;
&#13;
           education in the developing countries, and the need for&#13;
&#13;
           various reforms, so I hardly need to draw a picture of the&#13;
&#13;
           tremendous waste, both in terms of resources and more&#13;
&#13;
           importantly in human capital, which exists in this&#13;
&#13;
           field in most countries.    We have been eloquently and&#13;
&#13;
           strikingly told this morning by Mr. Ballantine that it is not&#13;
&#13;
           unusual for example to find in the typical African country tha&#13;
&#13;
           something like 55 to 60 percent of the school population&#13;
&#13;
           never completes the primary cycle of education, and of those&#13;
&#13;
           that go into secondary school, there remains a mere 6 percent&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             60&#13;

          who do actually   ~o   through the complete cycle.   These statistic&#13;
&#13;
          speak for themselves.     Obviously something needs to be done&#13;
&#13;
          and I am glad that the Bank is now willing to take this&#13;
&#13;
          challenge.    The usefulness of the part that the Bank can&#13;
&#13;
          play in this domain is of course very largely dependent on&#13;
&#13;
          the objective it assigns to itself.      You have in this regard&#13;
&#13;
          chosen as the three key objectives first to assist our member&#13;
          countrieâ&#128;¢ to bring more relevance to the content of their&#13;
&#13;
          education systems and programs: second, to assist them to&#13;
&#13;
          achieve more efficiency in the educational process, both throug&#13;
&#13;
          better training for teachers and the use of technologically&#13;
&#13;
          advanced supporting materials such as the TV; ahd third,&#13;

          to assist them achieve this objective in an econa.tc way.&#13;
&#13;
                       I think those are the key elements to any improvement&#13;
&#13;
          we can bring in this field, and I want you to know that&#13;
&#13;
          you have my unqualified support for your efforts in this&#13;
&#13;
          regard.&#13;
&#13;
                       Thank you.&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA: Thank you very much, Mr. Tazi.&#13;

&#13;
                       Mr. Chairman, I think we have had so far an extremely&#13;
          interesting discussion of this fascinating project, and I was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         61&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           particularly interested in the responses which were given to&#13;
&#13;
           the two questions asked by Mr. Hanemann, both of which questio s&#13;
&#13;
           I must say had been in my mind.&#13;
&#13;
                     I confess I was not wholly in sympathy with the&#13;
&#13;
           response given to those two questions, and in that respect,&#13;
&#13;
           judging by the reaction around the table, I might find&#13;
&#13;
           myself at variance with at least some of my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
           The difficulty of course about questioning the benefits of&#13;
&#13;
           educational expenditure is that it is rather like casting&#13;
&#13;
           doubts on the virtue of motherhood.   Educational   exp~nditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           is by definition in the minds of all of us an extremely good&#13;
&#13;
           thing, but like other forms of resource use, it is not costles ,&#13;
&#13;
           and the only question, therefore, there might be in the minds&#13;
&#13;
           of those who control or influence such expenditures is&#13;
&#13;
           whether they are likely to be more productive and hence in the&#13;
&#13;
           longer run in the best interests of the member countries where&#13;
&#13;
           those expenditures are being incurred.&#13;
&#13;
                     That after all, is what the Bank's operations are&#13;
&#13;
           supposed to be all about, and that, after all, is what the&#13;
&#13;
           process of economic development in the developing countries&#13;
&#13;
           is supposed to be all about.&#13;
&#13;
                     So, however much our emotions may be stirred&#13;
&#13;

           the poignant state of education in many of our member&#13;
&#13;
           countries, it does always do well to try to keep a cool head&#13;
&#13;
           in addressing oneself to those problems.&#13;
&#13;
                     It is, I think, with those thoughts in mind that&#13;
&#13;
           when the Bank adopted its policy on education to which Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Ballantine referred earlier, that it did largely confine itsel&#13;
&#13;
           or let me put it in a negative sense, it kept out of the&#13;
&#13;
           primary education field, except in some perhaps minor&#13;
&#13;
           indirect ways, and what I think Mr. Ballantine has suggested&#13;
&#13;
           this morning, and I understand, sir, with your endorsement,&#13;
&#13;
           is that the time has come to make a change in that and to re-&#13;
&#13;
           cast our thoughts upon that question.&#13;
&#13;
                     I'm not sure about that.    Certainly I'm not aware&#13;
&#13;
           that the matter has ever been put to the Board for its&#13;
                                                         C-hOl   "'JÂ£_ ;.,&#13;
           consideration, and if we are to make such a ahcnaqein our poli ies&#13;
&#13;
           I would personally appreciate the opportunity of having it&#13;
&#13;
           discussed by the Board before action is taken, so to speak,&#13;
&#13;
           to change our policies ad hoc.&#13;
&#13;
                     Let me say, perhaps, in passing, I take full note&#13;
&#13;
           of what Mr. Ballantine has said about What he called the&#13;
&#13;
           change in educational thought on this question of primary&#13;
&#13;
           education, and indeedÂ· generally.    I don't think this is the&#13;
&#13;
           moment to enter into a debate upon that matter with him, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            6&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           I don't propose to.     I would just say that it is within my&#13;
&#13;
           limited experience of these matters that I have tended to&#13;
&#13;
           find that educationists as a class are rather to be distrusted&#13;
&#13;
           and I don't of course in saying that -- I realize our own empl yee:&#13;
&#13;
           in that field are exempt from that suspicion, but as I say,&#13;
&#13;
           with limited experience, I have tended    ~find   they have&#13;
&#13;
           usually imbibed rather too much of psychology in the course&#13;
&#13;
           of their training and as a result, their views tend to change&#13;
&#13;
           if not from one year to the next, at least from one decade&#13;
&#13;
           to the next, going up and down like women's hemlines,&#13;
&#13;
           because I can't think offhand of a field in which fashions are&#13;
&#13;
           more prevalent than education, so I think we do well to be&#13;
&#13;
           a little cautious in accepting what purports to be a new view&#13;
&#13;
           about these matters..&#13;
&#13;
                     Well, I won't say any more about that, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
           at this time.&#13;
&#13;
                     It is clear that the four qualities which I think&#13;
&#13;
           were mentioned, quality, relevance, economy, and efficiency&#13;
&#13;
           can all be assessed as merits.     Clearly everyone must be in&#13;
&#13;
           favor of efficiency.     Everyone must be in favor of economy.&#13;
&#13;
           Everyone must be in favor of relevance.     T~ only question         ~&#13;
&#13;
           about quality is how much does it cost, and what are the&#13;
&#13;
           returns, what are its benefits?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                    Now, the second question to which Mr. Ballantine&#13;
&#13;
           referred in his response to Mr.Hanemann was really a quite&#13;
&#13;
           separate matter and doesn't depend for its answer upon what&#13;
&#13;
           view one takes of the answer given to the first question, and      hat&#13;
&#13;
           question was, assuming that it is appropriate on economic&#13;
&#13;
           grounds for considerable expenditures to be undertaken in the&#13;
&#13;
           developing countries in the priamry education field, necessari      ,&#13;
           I might say, at the expense of expenditures in other sectors of&#13;
&#13;
           those economies, because, as has been said, resources are not&#13;
&#13;
           unlimited, the question is who should do it?     Mr. Hanemann&#13;
&#13;
           I think in his question referred to UNESCO.    A similar questio&#13;
&#13;
           which had been in my own mind, and I thought of UNESCO also, I&#13;
&#13;
           also though of UNDP which after all was originally set up&#13;
&#13;
           with a biref in the technical assistance field    ~rticularly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Now, UNESCO of course has a much broader brief than that&#13;
&#13;
           and it may be that Mr. Hanemann's question is therefore the&#13;
&#13;
           more appropriate one and the one which I had misframed.&#13;
&#13;
           However, whether it is more appropriate to think in terms of&#13;
&#13;
           UNESCO or UNDP, the real question is, is it appropriate for the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank to make a take-over bid in this field? After all, I think&#13;
&#13;
           there must be some limit to our ambitions, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           That also is a question which perhaps at some future date we&#13;
&#13;
           may have a better opportunity to discuss than is provided&#13;

           aspect of it apart from the fact that it does tend to impinge -,&#13;

&#13;
           with that aspect of this project since it does so only&#13;

           does attract attention is the instructional television aspect&#13;

           of it.   Like Mr. Lynch, I have somewhat mixed views about&#13;

           certain amount of time each Saturday morning watching with my&#13;

          orne residual doubts about the use of television as an   instruc~&#13;

          bout the Hagerstown experiment, I was reminded in the course&#13;
&#13;
          f that of, I think, a rather famous experiment in economic&#13;
&#13;
          rganization which I think was carried out by the Mayoylinic&#13;
&#13;
          any, many years ago, and which is probably to be found in&#13;
&#13;
          i/terature which is no longer read by economic students, where          .7&#13;

          'twas found thatpperatives, when certain conditions of&#13;
&#13;
                   changed, became more productive.    This was deemed&#13;

                   to be the result of changing the conditions.     Unfor-&#13;
&#13;
                   as the experiment continued, it was discovered that&#13;

&#13;
           that so far as the TV component of this project is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
           I too think it's going to be a fascinating experiment and&#13;
&#13;
           I am quite prepared to support it on that basis.       I would&#13;
&#13;

           of this kind until we have at least a modicum of experience&#13;

           from the present one, and if I may say so, I should also like&#13;

           to have that remark apply to the general question of financing&#13;

           a project in a primary educational field, at least subject&#13;

                        Mr. Ballantine pointed out I think that this project&#13;

&#13;
           I think, Mr. Stone, the experim&amp;nt you were talking about&#13;
&#13;
           was carried out not by Mayo but by Western Electric Company&#13;
&#13;
           at their Hawthorne works in Chicago under the direction of&#13;
&#13;
           Dr. Rauthisberger in the mid-thirties.&#13;

                     Yes, Mr. Samarakkody.&#13;

                     MR. SAMARAKKODY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
                     I greatly appreciate being able to support this proje t.&#13;
&#13;
           I find that this scheme is the result of a kind of recon-&#13;
&#13;
           naissance mission in which IBRD is going to be associated,&#13;
&#13;
           and they've found out the difficulties of education in&#13;
&#13;
           this country and have come out with this project which covers&#13;
&#13;
           vocational education, secondary education, technical education,&#13;
&#13;
           post-secondary education, general secondary schools,&#13;
&#13;
           ~acher training, and primary education. I think it is a packa e&#13;
           which it would be not wise for us to try to look upon piece-&#13;
&#13;
           meal.   It is the result of study by UNESCO, the United Nations&#13;
&#13;
           agency which is charged with the problem of education.&#13;
&#13;
                     In this particular country, the school dropout rate&#13;
&#13;
           is very high. The reasons for it have been analyzed, and&#13;
&#13;
           this is an attempt to overcome some of the problems that arise&#13;
&#13;
           in this country.   Unless we do support primary education,&#13;
&#13;
           whatever the earlier policies of this Bank were, I think it is&#13;
&#13;
           time for us to review those policies because without widesprea&#13;
&#13;
           primary education in a country, you cannot possibly harness&#13;
&#13;
           the best talents in the country.&#13;

                          The situation in this country reminds me of what&#13;
&#13;
                the English poet said, "Full many a flower is born to blush&#13;
&#13;
                unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air."&#13;
&#13;
                          I think if you give education only to 44 percent&#13;
&#13;
                of the children in the country, 60 percent, the flowers of&#13;
&#13;
                60 percent of the country must necessarily go to waste, so I&#13;
&#13;
                take great pleasure in .being able to support this project.&#13;

&#13;
                which Mr. Stone put on the problem of cost versus quality,&#13;
&#13;
                has given me one idea if we cannot diminish the cost,to increa e&#13;
&#13;
                the output of the system of TV.   If we have 3000 or 5000&#13;
&#13;
                villages with TV in schools, and the schools are closed in the&#13;
&#13;
                evening, couldn't it be used for the parents to improve the&#13;
&#13;
                agricultural process, teaching them even when they cannot&#13;
&#13;
                read, something which could be useulf?      Did that idea come&#13;
&#13;
                into the minds of the Ivory Coast people --except that it is&#13;
&#13;
                the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Agriculture, bu&#13;
&#13;
                wouldn't. it be possible for the Bank to coordinate its&#13;

&#13;
                    MR. LETHEM: We have not wished at this stage to push&#13;
&#13;
           in this experiment for too many experiments at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
           However, as part of the preliminary studies to this project,&#13;
&#13;
           there has been involvement by ILO to examine how to use the     ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           television medium for the training of thoseprimary school&#13;
&#13;
           leavers who would not benefit from secondary education.&#13;
&#13;
            s you know, the employment of primary school leavers is one&#13;
&#13;
            f the difficult problems to solve in Africa, and this study&#13;
&#13;
            ooks into the problem of how to use television for assisting i&#13;
&#13;
                 training.&#13;
&#13;
                     In any case, this is only the first phase of a tele-&#13;
&#13;
            ision scheme.    Adult education will be performed with the&#13;
&#13;
            ystem at hand, once, and possibly if time is available also&#13;
&#13;
            n parallel with the teaching of primary school children.&#13;
&#13;
            n fact, Ivory Coast has already had an experiment and a rather&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           brief as possible because most of the comments that I intended&#13;
&#13;
           to make have been made by others, and the questions I had&#13;
&#13;
           intended to ask have been more than answered by the&#13;
&#13;
           interventions that Mr. Ballantine made, but I do want to&#13;
&#13;
           emphasize how much I personally welcome this project and in&#13;
&#13;
           view of the range of problems it addresses itself to&#13;
&#13;
           in the Ivory Coast, it seems to me that in view of the&#13;
&#13;
           constraints on resources for both capital investment and&#13;
&#13;
           traditional forms of education, and probably even more&#13;
&#13;
           importantly, the constraints with respect to the recurrent&#13;
&#13;
           costs involved in traditional forms of education, on the&#13;
&#13;
           scale that would be required in most developing countries,&#13;
&#13;
           in a very short time if this problem of low literacy rates&#13;
&#13;
           and lack of meaningful training is to be dealt with in any&#13;
&#13;
           meaningful way in the next few years, or in the foreseeable&#13;
&#13;
           future for that matter.   I think Mr. Ballantine also&#13;
&#13;
           emphasized that they're proceeding in an area here that&#13;
&#13;
           is not well known, and essentiallly there is a good deal of&#13;
&#13;
           chance-taking, I think.&#13;
&#13;
                     In view of the problem, I don't see where we have&#13;
&#13;
           any choice but to take whatever chances are involved in this&#13;
&#13;
           type of experiment.   In view of the experience in educational&#13;
&#13;
           TV already undergone here on this continent and elsewhere,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           I am not sure that I regard the experiment as all that&#13;
&#13;
           dangerous.    The problems that have to be overcome, and I&#13;
&#13;
           think the consequences in terms of productivity, although&#13;
&#13;
           not necessarily measurable in the ways we're accustomed to,&#13;
&#13;
           may ot be able to measure them precisely, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
           early stages, nevertheless, I think they'll be there, and&#13;
&#13;
           it may not be all that important whether we can measure them&#13;
&#13;
           precisely, particularly the benefits in terms of development&#13;
&#13;
           of human resources, which I think is the primary objective&#13;
&#13;
           of economic development.&#13;
&#13;
                        I think the involvement in other areas is&#13;
&#13;
           pointless unless that is the primary objective.&#13;
&#13;
                        I personally also welcome the fact this involves&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank in primary education and the introduction on a&#13;
&#13;
           nationwide scale of the ITV, and I would certainly agree with&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Stone's comment about the effectiveness of television&#13;
&#13;
           on pre-schoolers, from my own observation, and this is&#13;
&#13;
           consistent with your comment that the effectiveness will&#13;
&#13;
           probably be determined by what is put on to that television&#13;
&#13;
           screen, not the fact of the television screen.&#13;
&#13;
                        I think this project is certainly a pioneering&#13;
&#13;
           project so far as the Bank's concerned, and unlike one or two&#13;

           full benefits of the program.   I would imagine it would&#13;
&#13;
           require a minimum of five years and probably a good deal longer&#13;
&#13;
           If we wait until that time to try to identify effective means&#13;
&#13;
           of overcoming the literacy problem that exists, the problem&#13;
&#13;
           is going to be a good deal larger by the time we get around&#13;
&#13;
           to dealing with it.&#13;

           Bank Group is aware of the continuous effort of the Ivory&#13;
&#13;
           Coast toward development and is confident that the success&#13;
&#13;
           story of its economic performance over the past decade can-&#13;
&#13;
           be successfully maintained.&#13;
&#13;
                     Second, the Ivory Coast Government also considers&#13;
&#13;
           that this decision is a critical test for its capacity to&#13;
&#13;
           serve as an example for other developing countries which are&#13;
&#13;
           faced with several difficulties arising from the inadequacy of&#13;
&#13;
           their education system, not only to their economy but in&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTL   CONFIDENTIAL                                               75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          general to a global and harmonious development policy.&#13;
&#13;
          I am convinced that this challenge will be met.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Chairman, we also realize that this decision&#13;
&#13;
          is along the lines of the comments you have made in your&#13;
&#13;
          recent speech at Columbia University, in which you referred&#13;
&#13;
          in particular to the need for quality goals and a new approach&#13;
&#13;
          to development problems. I'm sure therefore that all developin&#13;
&#13;
          countries,especially in Africa, will be hopeful that it marks&#13;
&#13;
          a first concrete step of a new Bank policy which will be&#13;
&#13;
          increasingly oriented in the future toward a more direct&#13;
&#13;
           relationship between the classical ends of economic developmen&#13;
&#13;
           and its primary beneficiary which in the final analysis is the&#13;
&#13;
          human being.&#13;
&#13;
                    Please allow me to express once more my deep&#13;
&#13;
           appreciation to the officers and the staff of the Bank for the&#13;
&#13;
           efficient way in which they handled this important operation&#13;
&#13;
           and for the excellent and very well documented presentation&#13;
&#13;
           they just made of the approved loan.&#13;
&#13;
                     Last but not least, I would like to congratulate&#13;
&#13;
           you, Mr. Chairman, for recommending this loan at this&#13;
&#13;
           particular juncture and I can assure you that the Government&#13;
&#13;
           of the Ivory Coast is indeed grateful to you and to all those&#13;
&#13;
           who have made possible this investment.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            76&#13;
STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Thank you.&#13;

            Ivory Coast - Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is a partial transcript of the
            Board discussion concerning the First Education Project in
            the Ivory Coast.  The project has two noteworthy features.
            The first time the Bank will be directly involved in the
            field of primary education and also, for the first time, the
            Bank will participate in the financing of instructional
            television. The Ivory Coast provides particularly justified
            grounds for these innovations. The reason is that the
            country has achieved remarkable economic performance since
            independence in 1960. Primary education has continued to
            prepare primary school leavers exclusively for secondary
            school entrance and for white collar jobs. In so doing it
            has failed to respond to the real needs of the economy. The
            Government is aware of these shortcomings and has drawn up a
            long-term educational program based on a new policy. The
            main objectives of this policy are to improve the efficiency
            of the system and to expand the output of technical,
            vocational, agricultural education; and at the secondary and
            post-secondary levels.
