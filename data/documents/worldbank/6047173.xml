                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
By training and supporting key individuals in a country, WBI expects to contribute to the&#13;
country's development and poverty reduction. This evaluation examines the extent to&#13;
which this expectation has been achieved in Guatemala. Focusing on WBI activities&#13;
carried out during the period of FY02 and FY03, this evaluation assesses both the process&#13;
and the impact of WBI programs in Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
The process evaluation addresses how WBI sets strategic directions, designs and&#13;
implements learning activities for the country. The evaluation looks at the relevance of&#13;
WBI activities in terms of addressing key issues of the country, the level of the alignment&#13;
with the Bank's assistance strategy for Guatemala and the program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The impact evaluation considers the outcome of a WBI intervention, i.e., the extent to&#13;
which it has met its activity and program objectives. The impact issue is addressed by&#13;
examining the following evaluation questions:&#13;
       · What is the effectiveness of WBI activities in Guatemala?&#13;
&#13;
       · Did participants utilize what they learnt from the WBI activities?&#13;
       · What changes have WBI activities brought to individuals, organizations and&#13;
           the country?&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the evaluation explores some of the conditions under which WBI could&#13;
enhance the impact of learning programs on individuals and on the country, as well as&#13;
bring a comparative advantage in Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
Both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were employed in order to&#13;
benefit from new and available information.       The final analysis was based on the&#13;
following information :&#13;
&#13;
       · A desktop review of alignment of WBI activities with the Bank's Country&#13;
           Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Guatemala;&#13;
&#13;
       · A survey of 45 Guatemalan participants who attended at least one WBI&#13;
           learning activity during FY02 and FY03 (a longer than one-day event);&#13;
&#13;
       · Two focus group discussions with selected participants;&#13;
       · Several individual interviews with the WB Operations staff members, WBI&#13;
           task managers, local partners and client representatives; and&#13;
       · A case study of the WBI Anti-Corruption Project (ACP) implemented in&#13;
           Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
The primary conclusion from this evaluation is that WBI programs have brought some&#13;
positive impact to Guatemala, but that the impact could be greater if WBI improves the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
viii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
design and implementation of the programs offered. This conclusion is based on ten&#13;
findings.&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities in Guatemala were partially aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy. During the study period, there were a total of 33 Bank projects and 57 WBI&#13;
events for Guatemala. More that 700 participants were trained by WBI. By mapping the&#13;
topic areas and size of the WBI events with the four CAS priority areas, the WBI&#13;
activities in Guatemala seem to be aligned partially with the Bank's assistance strategy,&#13;
especially for the topics of Reducing Poverty and Improving Economic Management.&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities offered were mostly relevant to participants' work and to their country.&#13;
Both survey participants considered that that most WBI activities delivered were relevant&#13;
to their work and to their country (mean rating = 4.7 and 5.1 on a 7-point scale), but only&#13;
moderately relevant to some country development goals. The Anti-Corruption Project&#13;
was regarded as "highly relevant" by both the Operations team and the client.&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities in Guatemala were not designed strategically at the country level. By-&#13;
and-large, the WBI activities in Guatemala were not designed strategically at the country&#13;
level, reflecting the stage of the country's development. According to the Operations&#13;
staff, WBI had little flexibility on the offerings in the country and most offerings were&#13;
not completely tailored for the needs of the CAS and the choices were mainly supply&#13;
driven. On the other hand, WBI activities were generally organized well at event and&#13;
activity levels.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of WBI activities were implemented independently in the country, facilitated&#13;
through local partners. Over 60 percent of activities were delivered through local&#13;
partners. The Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala is believed to be a very successful&#13;
example of joint WBI and Operations implementation.&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities were effective in influencing individual knowledge and perceptions. The&#13;
participants gave high ratings to the WBI activities for raising awareness, providing&#13;
knowledge and skills, and helping understand the participant's role as agent (mean&#13;
ratings=5.2, on a 7-point scale).     The level of perceived effectiveness is positively&#13;
influenced by the perceived relevance of the event to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
Participants reported moderate utilization of knowledge and skills gained from WBI&#13;
activities. The mean rating of utilization was 4.5, on a 7-point scale. Utilization was&#13;
strongest in teaching and research applications, followed by raising public awareness.&#13;
Higher utilization of knowledge and skills was associated with having developed an&#13;
action plan during the course, or having a positive country environment.&#13;
&#13;
WBI has brought some positive impact/changes. Participants believe that WBI activities&#13;
have brought a moderately positive change to the country in the course topic areas (mean&#13;
rating = 5.1, on a 7-point scale). The changes were greater at individual levels than at&#13;
organizational or country level. The level of impact was influenced by the level of&#13;
utilization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Policy advisory support is seen as an effective intervention strategy in helping the&#13;
country build capacity. The case study of the Anti-Corruption Project has demonstrated&#13;
that policy advisory services as a non-traditional learning activity can be very effective in&#13;
enhancing capacity, especially at the country level, through building the country's&#13;
ownership and providing technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
WBI made little effort to ensure the sustainability of built capacity. The level of follow&#13;
up and facilitation of continued learning for participants is low.&#13;
&#13;
WBI' s advantage in Guatemala is not apparent.              According to participants and&#13;
Operations staff, unless WBI is willing to be more flexible and to provide a range of&#13;
products that are tailored according to the country's needs, it will not have comparative&#13;
advantage over other providers in Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
Drawing on the key findings, the evaluation offers several lessons that can be used by&#13;
WBI to improve its programs:&#13;
&#13;
The first lesson is that WBI can provide important technical assistance or more direct&#13;
knowledge products to the country. The content relevance to participants and to the&#13;
country is the key to the success of programs offered in the country. This is true&#13;
regardless of kinds of activities, types of delivery modes or location. This lesson has&#13;
been already applied by WBI since Guatemala became a focus country and a new&#13;
regional program coordinator has been assigned. A strategic plan for Guatemala at the&#13;
country level has been developed for FY05 in consultation with the Operations team.&#13;
&#13;
The second lesson is that the influence of the WBI intervention cannot reach maximum&#13;
impact if it focuses only on a relatively small number of individual participants. Within a&#13;
given organization or institution there must be a critical mass of participants in order to&#13;
substantially influence policy.      WBI needs to place more attention to building&#13;
institutional capacity in the country.&#13;
&#13;
The third lesson is that program impact can be enhanced strategically by:&#13;
        · designing and implementing programs jointly with Operations; and&#13;
&#13;
        · promoting country- and particularly government­ownership of the activity.&#13;
&#13;
The fourth lesson is that program impact can be enhanced technically by:&#13;
&#13;
        · using an action plan during the learning event; and&#13;
        · using the non-traditional learning approach of policy advice services.&#13;
&#13;
The final lesson is that program impact cannot be sustained in the country without the&#13;
continuing involvement and effort of WBI after the learning event is over.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                 1. CONTEXT AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
1.1     In collaboration with the regions, the World Bank Institute (WBI) has identified a&#13;
group of focus and priority countries. These countries have been selected because of&#13;
their size, regions and their status as Low Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) where&#13;
knowledge and learning activities may dominate the Bank's engagement strategy, or by&#13;
their status as Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper countries (PRSP), in which learning&#13;
programs are particularly important.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     Strategically, WBI is gradually moving from a thematic focus on training&#13;
individuals in global events to a country focus, i.e., to enhancing in-country capacity by&#13;
tailoring WBI programs to the specific needs of each country.               Training and other&#13;
learning products continue to be the main element in WBI's package of assistance, but&#13;
they are increasingly conceived as part of a menu of services which includes diagnostics&#13;
and advisory work, strengthening of learning and service delivery organizations, and&#13;
consulting on capacity enhancement issues.              This new country focus is aimed at&#13;
increasing the efficacy and impact of the WBI intervention and ensuring that these results&#13;
are sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     In response to this strategic change, the World Bank Institute Evaluation Group&#13;
(WBIEG) has conducted a country-focused evaluation in the 12 WBI focus countries. In&#13;
FY03, the evaluation occurred in the following five countries: Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Sri&#13;
Lanka, and Thailand.     In FY04, the evaluation was carried out in seven countries:&#13;
Burkina Faso, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tajikistan, and Yemen. Table 1&#13;
summarizes the scope for these two evaluations.&#13;

&#13;
                                 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
1.4     Building on findings and experience of the first five country focus evaluations,&#13;
the FY04 evaluation encompasses the WBI learning activities implemented in FY02 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FY03 in seven countries.1            Guatemala is one the countries included.              The overall&#13;
objectives of the evaluation are to:&#13;
&#13;
       (1) understand the process used by WBI to design and to deliver learning&#13;
              activities in Guatemala;&#13;
&#13;
       (2) assess the effectiveness and impact of WBI programs at individual,&#13;
              institutional and country levels;&#13;
&#13;
       (3) establish a baseline for further monitoring and evaluation activities; and&#13;
&#13;
       (4) form recommendations for the improvement of WBI programs.&#13;
&#13;
1.5       Additionally, the evaluation explores the conditions under which WBI produces&#13;
impact on individuals and on the country, as well as the comparative advantage of WBI&#13;
in the country.&#13;
&#13;
                         EVALUATION QUESTIONS AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
1.6       The evaluation design is based on several assumptions. It acknowledges that&#13;
achieving a country development goal is a result of collective effort, and that knowledge&#13;
intervention is only part of the effort. It considers the staged change that determines how&#13;
the country's capacity can be influenced by learning events. As such, the evaluation&#13;
seeks to address both the process and impact issues of a WBI intervention within a&#13;
common framework as shown in Table 2 below.&#13;

&#13;
       · How WBI activities were implemented for Guatemala?&#13;
&#13;
Impact questions&#13;
&#13;
1.8    The evaluation considers the impact of the WBI intervention as the extent to&#13;
which it has met its activity and program objectives. At the activity level, impact is&#13;
concerned with building capacity of individuals, institutions and the government. At the&#13;
program level, impact is concerned with the benefit that the country gains as a result of&#13;
changes in individuals, institutions and the government.         Realistically, the current&#13;
evaluation places attention on the following impact questions:&#13;
&#13;
       · What is the effectiveness of WBI activities in Guatemala?&#13;
       · Did participants utilize what they learnt from the WBI activities?&#13;
&#13;
       · What changes have WBI activities brought to individuals, organizations and&#13;
           the country?&#13;
&#13;
Data collection and sources&#13;
&#13;
1.9    Five main data collection methods were used, including qualitative and&#13;
quantitative methods. First, we searched relevant program documents and data to gather&#13;
a descriptive record of activities and outputs of each activity implemented by the Bank&#13;
and by WBI in Guatemala. The findings of the review set the context for the evaluation.&#13;
Additionally, the following data collection activities were employed:&#13;
&#13;
      (1) A participant survey&#13;
&#13;
      (2) Focus group discussions with selected participants&#13;
&#13;
      (3) Interviews with Bank Operations staff, especially those located in the country&#13;
           office, interviews with WBI task managers, and interviews with local program&#13;
           partners or client representatives&#13;
&#13;
      (4) A case study of a successful WBI learning program implemented in&#13;
           Guatemala&#13;
&#13;
Study population&#13;
&#13;
1.10   The WBI Client Record System (CRS) shows that over 700 Guatemalans attended&#13;
various WBI learning events during FY02 and FY03. Based on the study criteria, the&#13;
evaluation identified all participants who attended learning activities that were longer&#13;
than one day in duration, as impacts of shorter activities are likely to be negligible or&#13;
non-existent. As a result, 163 individual participant records from 27 learning events were&#13;
extracted from CRS. Forty percent of these participants (n=66) attended four WBI&#13;
learning events delivered in Guatemala, and the remaining sixty percent (n=97)&#13;
participated in 23 learning events outside the country. Annex 1 provides a list of WBI&#13;
learning events that include Guatemalan participants during FY02 and FY03.&#13;

                     2. DATA COLLECTION RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
2.1     Data collection was carried out between December 2003 and March 2004. This&#13;
section provides a summary of the scope, process and results of each data collection&#13;
activity.&#13;
&#13;
                                    DESKTOP REVIEW&#13;
&#13;
2.2     The evaluation conducted a desktop review and analysis of all Bank activities&#13;
implemented in Guatemala during FY02 and FY03.              This covered the following&#13;
information:&#13;
        · 2002 Guatemala PRSP;&#13;
&#13;
        · 1998 Guatemala Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and 2002 CAS Progress&#13;
           Report;&#13;
&#13;
        · WBI's Country Program Brief (CPB);&#13;
        · Information from the Business Warehouse documenting all Bank lending and&#13;
           no-lending activities carried out in Guatemala; and&#13;
        · All WBI activities in Guatemala and WBI activities that included Guatemalan&#13;
           participants in other locations.&#13;
&#13;
2.3     The review and analysis centers on assessing the relevance of the WBI&#13;
intervention to Guatemala's needs.&#13;
&#13;
                                  PARTICIPANT SURVEY&#13;
&#13;
2.4     A survey was carried out with Guatemalan participants who attended WBI&#13;
learning activities longer than one-day in FY02 and FY03 and who also had valid contact&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
Instrument&#13;
&#13;
2.5     The survey instrument used follows the one applied across all eleven countries&#13;
studied in FY03 and FY4. A copy of this survey instrument is attached at Annex 2.&#13;
Specifically, the survey instrument seeks information from participants about:&#13;
        · their perceptions of WBI activities regarding relevance and effectiveness;&#13;
&#13;
        · their use of knowledge and skills learnt from the WBI event; and&#13;
        · their perceived impact of knowledge utilization at individual, organizational&#13;
           and/or country levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Response rate and representation&#13;
&#13;
2.6     Of 163 individual participants extracted from CRS, 132 had a contact information&#13;
were targeted for the survey. The survey was carried out during December 2003 and&#13;
February 2004 through a local consultant. A total of 48 participants were found to have&#13;
either wrong contact information or could not be located during the survey period,&#13;
making the final adjusted sample 84 participants. Forty-five participants completed the&#13;
survey, making an adjusted response rate of 54 percent. These respondents represented&#13;
15 learning events, four offered in Guatemala and 11 outside the country. The list of&#13;
learning events attended by the surveyed population, together with some features of the&#13;
events, is summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
2.7     To understand the representation of the final sample, comparisons were made&#13;
between survey respondents and the remaining population. Table 3 shows that, overall,&#13;
there are no significant differences between the two groups with respect to available&#13;
demographic information, the venue of learning events they attended, or the sectors they&#13;
represented at the time they were trained.&#13;

Characteristics of respondents&#13;
&#13;
2.8     Table 4 presents the key characteristics of survey respondents and the WBI&#13;
activities they attended during the study period.     Nearly 40 percent of respondents&#13;
represent academic society.        The rest almost equally represent Non-Government&#13;
Organizations (NGOs) and government sectors. Over half of the respondents have been&#13;
working in teaching and research fields since completing the WBI learning events. Only&#13;
two respondents stated that they work directly in making policy and legislation. More&#13;
than 55 percent (n=25) are at senior and top levels of their organization, 27 percent are&#13;
middle managers, and less than 10 percent are at junior and entry levels. There are&#13;
somewhat more males among the respondents.&#13;

&#13;
                                  FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS&#13;
&#13;
2.9    The purpose of focus group discussions (FGDs) was to obtain more detailed&#13;
information from participants, to elaborate their feedback on the effectiveness of the&#13;
learning event, and to solicit their recommendations for improving WBI programs.&#13;
&#13;
2.10   Two focus group discussions were conducted during March 2004 in the World&#13;
Bank Country Offices in Guatemala City. The discussions were moderated by a local&#13;
consultant, following a standard interview protocol, a copy of which is attached at Annex&#13;
4.&#13;
&#13;
2.11   Of 27 individuals invited, 13 participated in the focus groups. The most common&#13;
reason for declining to participate was that they were too busy with their current work.&#13;
The characteristics of the focus group attendees and their training information are&#13;
summarized in Table 5.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS&#13;
&#13;
2.12   Unstructured interviews were conducted to address both the process and impact of&#13;
WBI activities in Guatemala. The interviewees were:&#13;
       · Four WB Operations staff who had worked in Guatemala;&#13;
&#13;
       · Three WBI task managers whose learning activities were physically delivered&#13;
            in Guatemala;&#13;
&#13;
       · Two local partners who were involved in implementing WBI activities within&#13;
            the country; and&#13;
&#13;
       · One client of the WBI Anti-Corruption Project (stakeholder).&#13;
&#13;
2.13   These interviews took place in Washington and in the country office. Interviews&#13;
lasted 30 to 60 minutes and all were conducted face-to-face. All interviews were guided&#13;
by a set of questions whichare attached at Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
                                      CASE STUDY&#13;
&#13;
2.14   A case study of the Anti-Corruption Project (ACP) is analyzed to (a) illustrate&#13;
how WBI designed and delivered an intervention for Guatemala; and (b) explore the&#13;
extent to which WBI has enhanced country capacity, through a non-traditional learning&#13;
event. The case study largely relies on a desktop review of program briefs, press and&#13;
government documents, and interview information with the three Operations staff, one&#13;
WBI task manager and one client representative.&#13;

   3. PROGRAM RELEVANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
3.1     WBI activities in Guatemala were reviewed from two perspectives: the extent to&#13;
which WBI designed the programs that were relevant to Guatemala, and how effectively&#13;
WBI activities were implemented for the country during the study period.&#13;
&#13;
              RELEVANCEOF WBI ACTIVITIES TO THE COUNTRY'S NEEDS&#13;
&#13;
3.2     This section presents some key messages derived from the analysis of the degree&#13;
to which WBI activities offered for Guatemala reflect the country's needs and were&#13;
aligned with CAS. A detailed review and analysis results, including a mapping table, are&#13;
provided in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
Critical issues identified in Guatemala PRSP&#13;
&#13;
3.3     The 1996 Peace Accords ended 36 years of armed conflict within Guatemala.&#13;
The fundamental cause of the conflict has been widely attributed to the historical pattern&#13;
of exclusion, particularly with regards to indigenous groups. The Peace Accords placed&#13;
poverty reduction at the forefront of the national agenda in order to build a more&#13;
equitable and inclusive society. The 1998 Guatemala PRSP aims to reconcile the past by&#13;
focusing the national agenda on three primary pillars: economic growth with equity,&#13;
investment in human capital, and investment in physical capital.&#13;
        · Economic Growth with Equity. Although Guatemala has had surprisingly&#13;
            solid economic growth for a historically exclusive society, the growth rates&#13;
            have not been sufficient to benefit the poor. Guatemala has one of the highest&#13;
            poverty rates in Latin America. The Guatemala PRSP asserts that the country&#13;
            must achieve stronger economic growth in order to achieve the underlying&#13;
            goal of reducing poverty.&#13;
        · Investment in Human Capital. The second pillar of the PRSP focuses on&#13;
            building human capital while targeting the poorest citizens. Investments are&#13;
            concentrated in the areas of greatest need which includes health, education&#13;
            and food security.&#13;
        · Investment in Physical Capital.        The third pillar invests in the physical&#13;
            infrastructure of Guatemala's poorest and most remote areas. The areas of&#13;
            priority include: water supply, basic sanitation, roads and energy.&#13;
&#13;
3.4     Additionally, three areas of need are outlined in the PRSP as part of Guatemala's&#13;
efforts to reduce poverty and build social inclusion: i.e., public sector modernization,&#13;
governance, and decentralization and participation.&#13;
&#13;
Issues identified in the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
&#13;
3.5     Subsequent to the 1996 Peace Accords, the World Bank Group's assistance&#13;
intensified during the implementation of the CAS strategy from 1998 to 2001. The 2002&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CAS Progress Report builds on the foundation laid in the 1998 CAS, which shared the&#13;
national PRSP goals of reducing poverty and building a more inclusive society. The&#13;
CAS has four interlinked development priorities that closely mirror, though do not&#13;
perfectly align with, the pillars of the PRSP:&#13;
&#13;
        · Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion;&#13;
        · Strengthening social cohesion and participatory decision processes;&#13;
&#13;
        · Improving economic management to maintain macroeconomic stability and&#13;
            foster growth; and&#13;
&#13;
        · Improving governance and public sector management.&#13;
&#13;
3.6     The World Bank's products are designed to make progress in the priority areas,&#13;
and are composed of lending and non-lending products. There were a total of 19 active&#13;
lending products during FY02-03 that were valued at a total of $760.5 million. During&#13;
the same period, there were nine non-lending products valued in the amount of $731,000.&#13;
&#13;
3.7     The review of alignment of the Bank activities and PRSP suggests that the goals&#13;
outlined by the CAS, along with Bank products, are clearly strongly aligned with the&#13;
goals stated in the Guatemala PRSP (Annex 6).&#13;
&#13;
Alignment of WBI activities with the CAS&#13;
&#13;
3.8     This section examines the degree to which WBI activities appear to align with the&#13;
World Bank Group's products during the fiscal years of 2002 and 2003. During the study&#13;
period, there were a total of 33 Bank projects, and 15 WBI in-country events. There were&#13;
also 42 WBI regional and global events that included participants from Guatemala. More&#13;
than 700 individuals were trained by WBI.&#13;
&#13;
3.9     The types of WBI activities are mapped into two categories: those held within&#13;
Guatemala, and those held out-of-country that included Guatemalan participants. The&#13;
contents of WBI activities and Bank products are mapped under the four CAS priorities&#13;
and within the major WBI classifications.         For example, the Universatization of&#13;
Education lending product is mapped under the "Reducing Poverty and Social Inclusion"&#13;
CAS priority, and further mapped under the WBI "Education Program" classification.&#13;
This helps broadly reveal which lending and WBI activities address specific CAS&#13;
priorities while gaining additional insights by the area of focus. The detailed mapping&#13;
result is tabled and included in Annex 6. Some key information is extracted in Table 6&#13;
and displayed in Figure 1.&#13;

*There were only 19 active lending products during FY02-03, however five of them could not be disentangled between the CAS&#13;
priorities of Reducing Poverty and Decentralization and Participation. The costs of those activities were split bet ween the two priority&#13;
areas, and that is why there appears to be more lending products in the chart above.&#13;

Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion&#13;
&#13;
3.10        Poverty reduction is the centerpiece of Guatemala's development agenda, and this&#13;
development priority overall has the greatest number of WB products and WBI activities:&#13;
10 lending products, five non-lending products, six in-country WBI activities, and 21 out-&#13;
of-country WBI activities with Guatemalan participants. Breaking this development&#13;
priority down by WBI classification reveals that in the Education Programs classification,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Universalization of Basic Education lending product is aligned with four WBI&#13;
activities aimed at the education sector. In Poverty and Growth there are two active&#13;
lending and four non-lending products that are aligned with WBI activities (both in and&#13;
out of country). There are three WBI classifications in which there were Bank products:&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources, Rural Poverty and Development, and Social&#13;
Protection and Risk Management ­ yet no WBI activities within Guatemala. The same is&#13;
true for Health, Nutrition and Population, where there is one non-lending product. There&#13;
were no Bank products or in country WBI activities in the City and Urban Management&#13;
classification. This makes sense since the focus for this priority is on rural communities.&#13;
Similarly, in the area of Water Programs there were neither in-country WBI activities nor&#13;
Bank products.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening social cohesion and participatory decision processes&#13;
&#13;
3.11    Both the CAS and PRSP stated that poverty reduction is the primary goal, which&#13;
is strongly tied to the goal of building social inclusion.        The WBI classification of&#13;
Community Empowerment and Social Inclusion was the only classification that aligned&#13;
with this development priority. There were seven lending products in this classification,&#13;
yet only one WBI activity was held in Guatemala (FY2003). Furthermore, there were no&#13;
Guatemalan participants involved in WBI activities held outside of the country in this&#13;
area. This could be interpreted as a lack of demand, or more likely, a lack of opportunity&#13;
for the poor to be involved in activities of this sort due to financial constraints.&#13;
&#13;
Improving economic management to maintain macroeconomic stability and foster&#13;
growth&#13;
&#13;
3.12    Under this CAS priority, there were a total of four lending products, four non-&#13;
lending products, two in-country WBI activities, and nine out-of-country WBI activities&#13;
with Guatemalan participants.&#13;
&#13;
Improving governance and public sector management&#13;
&#13;
3.13    This fourth development priority had a total of three lending products, six in-&#13;
country WBI activities, and six out-of country activities with Guatemalan participants.&#13;
There were two WBI classifications which appear to be least aligned: Governance and&#13;
the Public Sector. Governance had one lending product, four in-country WBI activities,&#13;
and four out-of-country WBI activities with Guatemalan participants. The Public Sector&#13;
had two lending products, two in-country WBI activities, and two out-of-country WBI&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
Summary&#13;
&#13;
3.14    The level of alignment of WBI activities with CAS objectives and Bank&#13;
lending/non-lending products is somewhat mixed.                Using the criteria of WBI&#13;
classification, of the fourteen categories, only half seem to be aligned relatively well&#13;
between Bank lending/non-lending products and in-country WBI activities, i.e., Reducing&#13;
Poverty and Improving Economic Management. The areas where the alignment was least&#13;
are Improving Governance and Public Sector Management.&#13;

                                             STAKEHOLDERS' VIEWS OF RELEVANCE&#13;
&#13;
3.15    Both survey and focus groups participants were asked their opinions about the&#13;
relevance of WBI activities to their individual work, to their country's needs and to&#13;
country development goals.&#13;
&#13;
Relevance to participants' work&#13;
&#13;
3.16    WBI activities were highly relevant to participant's work. As shown in Figure 2,&#13;
using a 7-point scale (1=not relevant and 7=extremely relevant), a relatively large share&#13;
of survey respondents (&gt;40 percent) felt that the WBI activity they attended was highly&#13;
relevant to their work (6 and 7). And another 37 percent respondents gave a rating of&#13;
relevance at or just above the midpoint (4 and 5). The mean rating score of the perceived&#13;
relevance is 4.7, which indicates that the WBI activity designed was somewhat relevant&#13;
to the participants needs.&#13;
&#13;

Relevance to the country's needs&#13;
&#13;
Views of participants&#13;
&#13;
3.17    Survey participants felt that WBI activities were highly relevant to their country's&#13;
needs. As seen in Figure 3, the majority of respondents rated the WBI activity as having&#13;
high relevance to their country needs. The mean rating is 5.1 on a 7-point scale.&#13;
&#13;
3.18    On the other hand, focus group participants indicated that some of the contents&#13;
and models of WBI activities were not easily adaptable to a more complex and culturally&#13;
diverse society like Guatemala, where there are more than twenty different ethnic groups.&#13;
Some of the models exposed were seen as better suited to more homogenous societies.&#13;
Thus, researchers participating in one of the focus groups insisted on the importance of&#13;
doing more national research, and directing international financial resources to strengthen&#13;
local capacities to conduct social research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    12&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Views of Operations staff and partners&#13;
&#13;
3.19    At the country level, Operations staff felt that WBI had little flexibility on the&#13;
offerings, and most activities were not tailored for the needs of the CAS.&#13;
&#13;
3.20    On the other hand, all partners/clients interviewed felt that most WBI activities&#13;
delivered in Guatemala were relevant to the country's needs. According to data from the&#13;
Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) Center in Radefal Landivar University, of&#13;
the 38 programs broadcasted during the period of May 2002 and January 2004, 14 or 37&#13;
percent were from WBI, the highest offering of any organization. This high acceptance&#13;
rate, as commented by the director of GDLN, reflects that WBI events were considered to&#13;
be relevant to the country's needs. However, in most cases the "relevance" referred to by&#13;
partners is largely in narrow terms, i.e., not in reference to other national priority areas,&#13;
rather it is concentrated on a particular topic field. The exception is the Anti-Corruption&#13;
Project, which is highly regarded as "meeting the country's needs" by both the&#13;
Operations team and the client country.                             As one client representative interviewed&#13;
indicated at the interview:&#13;
&#13;
        "Anti-corruption/transparency is one of the themes identified by the government&#13;
        to be addressed in the next five years2. The Bank's support is just right on the&#13;
        topic (to her, WBI is the Bank). Importantly, the Bank plays its role in a very&#13;
        smart way. Rather than standing in the front to tell what the government should&#13;
        do, the Bank has stayed behind the scene to facilitate the process. That certainly&#13;
        enhanced the ownership of the government and civil society trust of the&#13;
        government."&#13;

Relevance to the country development goals&#13;
&#13;
3.21    Despite the fact that most survey respondents rated the WBI activities as having&#13;
relatively high relevance to their work and to their country, WBI activities were rated as&#13;
moderately relevant to country development goals. Table 7 shows between 30 and 40&#13;
percent survey participants felt that the WBI activities were not directly relevant.&#13;

According to these respondents, the WBI activities were moderately relevant to the&#13;
following three country development goals: eradicate extreme poverty, achieve universal&#13;

&#13;
Activity planning for the country's needs&#13;
&#13;
3.22    Although the review of alignment of WBI activities and CAS shows some degree&#13;
of coherence, it may be largely interpreted as coincidence rather than a result of strategic&#13;
planning. From the interviews with the Operations staff, there is no evidence showing&#13;
that WBI activities for Guatemala (in-and out-country) in FY02 and FY03 were&#13;
strategically planned at the country level. The Operations staff were not aware of a big&#13;
picture, i.e., what WBI tried to achieve in Guatemala. Rather, they were simply aware of&#13;
individual training courses held from time to time which they considered to be of "benefit&#13;
most to individuals." Some staff commented:&#13;
&#13;
        "There was little flexibility on the offerings by WBI, and they were not tailored&#13;
        for the needs of the CAS. There is a major effort recently by WBI to better&#13;
        coordinate, particularly since Guatemala became a focus country and they&#13;
        assigned a new program coordinator."&#13;
&#13;
        "Six months ago, I was not aware about WBI activities, even no idea about WBI.&#13;
        Over the past 6 months, I became more aware about WBI, especially the Anti-&#13;
        Corruption Project."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.23     On the other hand, the planning and organizing process seems to be carried out&#13;
well at the activity and event levels. Most courses/events delivered within the country,&#13;
either by face to face or through DL, were carefully planned and tailored in some degree&#13;
to meet participants' needs. In the case of the Community Empowerment and Social&#13;
Inclusion program (CESI), a formal needs assessment was conducted through a survey&#13;
and focus group interviews. Despite all these efforts at the activity level, Operations staff&#13;
still felt that WBI activities were largely supply driven. One country office staff pointed&#13;
out:&#13;
&#13;
         "Yet, the WBI activities were not "strategic" designed, I think you can say that&#13;
         the organization of the events was well designed, but their choices were not really&#13;
         demand-driven or requested. My sense is that they were mainly supply-driven,&#13;
         and just now we can see a major change and effort to ensure that the events are&#13;
         not only better aligned but also demand-driven."&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
&#13;
3.24     It is observed that more than half of in-country courses and events of FY02 and&#13;
FY03 were implemented in an independent fashion. Even though some courses were&#13;
aligned well with ongoing WB project topics, there was no much interaction between the&#13;
Operations team and WBI. For example, one Operations staff commented during the&#13;
interview:&#13;
&#13;
      "Many WBI programs are relevant to what we are doing in the country, such as&#13;
      community empowerment. However, we were not involved in decision-making about&#13;
      how the program could be implemented in the country, nor consulted about who&#13;
      should be given a priority for the training. From the participant list, we can see&#13;
      most of these WBI selected trainees were likely to gain benefit for themselves and&#13;
      had little influence on the community."&#13;
&#13;
3.25     On the same line, one former participant commented during the focus group&#13;
discussion:&#13;
&#13;
      "It is important that before designing a course WBI takes into account the social,&#13;
      political and cultural reality of the countries in order to improve its success.&#13;
      Countries, even in the same region, are not homogenous but respond to different&#13;
      needs and specific topics."&#13;
&#13;
3.26     Meanwhile, most WBI activities were implemented through a local partner. Of&#13;
the 15 FY02 and FY03 activities covered in the survey, at least two third (n=10) used a&#13;
local partner during the implementation. In most cases, local partners were individuals or&#13;
consulting firms. The exception is the GDLN Center in Radefal Landivar University.&#13;
The most common use of the local partner was as a facilitator, or as someone to make&#13;
logistical arrangement and recruit participants. It has been shown that using a local&#13;
partner have made the WBI implementation in country easier. On the other hand, this&#13;
approach has weaken somewhat the interaction between the Operations and the WBI&#13;
team. Many times the Bank country office was not fully aware of what these partners&#13;
were doing. During the interview, two country Operations staff mentioned that, before&#13;
2002, they were often consulted when WBI offered a course, especially regarding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
participant selection. Since GDLN has been involved, they have become less aware of&#13;
WBI courses in a timely fashion. Sometime, they were copied emails just before the&#13;
course commenced. Given a short notice, there was little time for them to review and to&#13;
make suggestions.&#13;
&#13;
3.27    During the study period, only one WBI activity has been integrated or joint&#13;
implemented with the Operations team. In this category, WBI and Operations share the&#13;
ownership of the activity. Mutual WBI and Operations involvement is seen not only in&#13;
program/activity design but throughout the entire implementation process. The impact of&#13;
the activity implemented through this model will be examined in the report through a&#13;
case study of the Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala.&#13;

             In 2000, Alfonso Portillo became the first democratically elected president since&#13;
             the conflict. In the post-war period, support and trust for the government was at&#13;
             an all time low. There were rampant allegations of corruption against both the public&#13;
             and private sector. It became increasingly apparent that the government needed to&#13;
             change its image to renew citizen support, strengthen investor confidence, improve&#13;
             human rights, and recover from economic hardships caused by the civil war. Due to&#13;
             increasing pressure from the public and international community, President Portillo&#13;
             tried to reestablish public faith in the democratic process and requested support&#13;
             from the World Bank to design an Anti -Corruption strategy for the country.&#13;
&#13;
             In January 2002, following the request of the Guatemalan government, a team of&#13;
             individuals from Latin American and Caribbean Region (LAC) and WBI Government&#13;
             Group (WBIGG) met with the Guatemalan officials to discuss designing and&#13;
             implementing an Anti-Corruption strategy that could work in the context of&#13;
             Guatemala's post-war environment.&#13;

                                                  IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
4.1     In the previous section, we present how WBI activities for Guatemala were&#13;
designed, planned and implemented. In this section, we turn attention to evaluation&#13;
results concerning the outcome of WBI activities in Guatemala. As discussed earlier in&#13;
Chapter 1, the evaluation is concerned with specifically the impact on capacity building&#13;
at individual, organizational and country levels.                  Understanding that changes in&#13;
individual behaviors and organizations occur in stages, a set of outcome proxy measures&#13;
is used to assess the extent to which the WBI intervention has enhanced capacity of&#13;
individuals, organizations and the country, namely, effectiveness, utilization and impact&#13;
(change).&#13;
&#13;
4.2     The analyses presented here are based on information derived from the survey,&#13;
focus groups and case study, as the evaluation did not obtain much impact information&#13;
from other data sources.&#13;
&#13;
                       Box 2: WBI Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala:&#13;
                                             Stage of Change&#13;
 In April 2002, Francesca Recanatini from WBIGG visited Guatemala to present to the government, civil&#13;
 society and international community the major components of the Anti-Corruption strategy, how it has been&#13;
 implemented in other countries, and the ways in which it can be adapted to fit Guatemala's particular&#13;
 circumstances. This seven-stage framework also outlines the roles that the World Bank and the country&#13;
 would play in various stages of the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                   PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS&#13;
&#13;
4.3    Through the participant survey and focus groups, we asked the participants to&#13;
assess the effectiveness of the WBI activities in respect with the following dimensions:&#13;
       · raising awareness;&#13;
&#13;
       · providing knowledge and skills;&#13;
       · helping understand their role as agent in development;&#13;
&#13;
       · helping develop strategies to address the needs of organizations;&#13;
       · helping develop strategies to address the needs of the country; and&#13;
&#13;
       · helping develop contacts and partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
4.4    Figure 4 shows that although moderate to high mean effectiveness scores are&#13;
obtained across all dimensions (mean=4.0-5.2, on a 7-point scale), the WBI activities&#13;
appear most effective in influencing individuals.               Approximate 50 percent of the&#13;
respondents gave higher rating scores (6 and 7) to the aspects of raising awareness,&#13;
providing knowledge and skills, and helping understand their role as agent in&#13;
development ­ notably focusing on individual level dimensions (Figure 5). Respondents&#13;
considered the WBI activities as less effective in helping participants develop strategies&#13;
to address the needs for organizations and the country, or to develop contacts and&#13;
partnerships.&#13;

4.5    More detailed comments came from the focus group discussions. Participants&#13;
reported that the WBI learning events helped them in four main ways:&#13;
&#13;
4.6    First, the learning events helped them develop a new way of thinking and wider&#13;
vision. The courses generated a more accurate knowledge about a specific topic through&#13;
learning what is happening in other countries. The content, theoretical framework, and&#13;
concepts offered a wider vision of the topics and allowed participants to at least discuss&#13;
issues that were not yet on the political agenda of Guatemala. For example, national&#13;
educational assessments were only a part of a broader reform in education currently&#13;
going on in the country. Participants learned some new concepts such as the importance&#13;
of adopting new ways of evaluating individuals and institutions, as well as students in&#13;
classrooms. They also learned new ways of framing anti-poverty strategies.&#13;
&#13;
4.7    Second, participants learnt advanced knowledge, theory and techniques.&#13;
Participants found that the WBI courses represented advanced knowledge or theory and&#13;
techniques in some fields, particularly in educational reform, quantitative analysis, and&#13;
competitiveness ­ although some strategies and tools introduced in the learning events&#13;
will not necessarily be applied with new governmental measures.                 Additionally, the&#13;
course material provided was seen as very useful and up-to-date.&#13;
&#13;
4.8    Third, the WBI activities helped participants establish networks with international&#13;
and national counterparts. One participant noted that:&#13;
&#13;
       "The WBI courses allow us to debate issues that are not necessarily in the&#13;
       national agenda and to start a conversation among professionals as a way to&#13;
       create a rich network of people interacting about a specific issue."&#13;
&#13;
4.9    Finally, the learning activities gave participants a sense of achievement and&#13;
reward.   Most participants found that the courses have had an impact on their&#13;
professional activities, although they reported that the kind of impact and change that&#13;
they could make would depend on the political will of decision-making officials.&#13;

                                          Earaly Indicators of Impact&#13;
               At the first meeting in April 2002, WB met with the Guatemalan government and civil&#13;
               society to establish the foundation of partnership necessary to begin the Anti-Corruption&#13;
               Project (ACP).      Though the discussion was productive, it was clear that the&#13;
               "fragmentation of the civil society and the unwillingness of some civil society groups to&#13;
               work jointly with the government" would create obstacles in forming the Steering&#13;
               Committee. In response, members of WBIGG met with civil society representatives to&#13;
               exchange information and ideas about how to encourage a more participatory A-C&#13;
               process.&#13;
&#13;
               Both parties agreed to form a preliminary working group with the government and that&#13;
               both would choose the future members of the ACP Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
               WBIGG also met with members from the international donor community to get their&#13;
               support. UN representatives, USAID, IDB, and the Japanese and Italian embassies&#13;
               welcomed WBI's role in helping the Guatemalan government.&#13;
&#13;
               After various negotiations and discussions, the Guatemalan government signed a formal&#13;
               Memo of Understanding on April 26, 2002 outlining their strong commitment to working&#13;
               with the international community and the World Bank to fight corruption.&#13;

&#13;
4.10    Participants were asked if they were able to use the knowledge and skills that they&#13;
learnt from the WBI activities in the following areas:&#13;
        · Research&#13;
&#13;
        · Teaching&#13;
        · Public awareness in development issues&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
        · Country development strategies&#13;
&#13;
4.11    Between 50 and 70 percent of respondents said that they had been able to make&#13;
use of the knowledge and skills acquired from learning events. However, as shown in&#13;
Figure 6, the reported utilization is at a moderate level. On average, only about a third of&#13;
the respondents reported that they used the new knowledge or skills very often in their&#13;
work (ratings of 6 or 7 on a 7-point scale, from low to high).&#13;

&#13;
4.12   Moreover, considerable variation can be seen in utilization across the areas of&#13;
knowledge and skills (see Figure 7). The most use of the WBI activities is in teaching,&#13;
followed by raising public awareness -- areas reflecting individual work and&#13;
responsibility.     Similar to the perceived effectiveness, the level of utilization at&#13;
organizational and at country levels (e.g. influencing legislation or developing country&#13;
strategy) is rather limited (mean ratings=3.7 and 4.2).&#13;

4.13   The message derived from the focus group discussion supports the above finding.&#13;
Some participants have applied new perspectives learned on a daily basis, particularly in&#13;
their professional activities.               Participants also used knowledge and skills learnt to&#13;
influence organizational or institutional change. Some concrete examples include:&#13;
&#13;
       · Use of some of the methodologies and contents in distance learning programs.&#13;
            One participant tried to use WBI training programs methods in a virtual&#13;
            course related to indigenous rights;&#13;
       · Introduction of new knowledge and pedagogy in already existing higher&#13;
            education programs (Masters degrees in Social Sciences);&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         · Application of new evaluation paradigms in educational institutions;&#13;
&#13;
         · Generation of institutional discussions about the importance of development&#13;
             models or national education reforms; and&#13;
         · Application of evaluation tools in the classroom.&#13;

                 Box 4: WBI Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala: Utilization&#13;
&#13;
   Following the Memo of Understanding, a series of meetings of the government with civil society was&#13;
   facilitated by the Bank during May and June 2002.&#13;
&#13;
   These meetings led to two National Workshops that were facilitated by the Bank. The final outcome of the&#13;
   first workshop in July 15, 2002 was the formation of a temporary committee called the "Comision&#13;
   Transitoria." This governing body consisted of members from government and civil society. The Comision&#13;
   Transitoria built upon the suggestions made in the first National Workshop and created a draft proposal to&#13;
   discuss at the second Workshop held on September 9, 2002. This proposal outlined the structure of the&#13;
   Steering Committee, which is:&#13;
   ·    Consejo Coordinador (Committee Coordinator): to coordinate various activities and work related to anti -&#13;
   corruption;&#13;
   ·    Technical Unit: to collect and analyze empirical data using Governance and Anti -Corruption (GAC)&#13;
   diagnostics; and&#13;
   ·    Foro (Forum): to discuss issues regarding the two other bodies' work&#13;
&#13;
   In the following months, the Consejo Coordinator was responsible for choosing the members of the Technical&#13;
   Unit to perform three GAC diagnostics and an action plan. WBI held a number of videoconferences with the&#13;
   Consejo to guide them in these efforts. In May 2003, another workshop was held with the international&#13;
   anti-corruption community to discuss transparency and promotion of the Consejo's efforts in fighting&#13;
   corruption in Guatemala. As a result, by October 21, 2003, the Consejo was ready to launch phase two of&#13;
   the ACP model.&#13;

4.15    As seen in Figure 8, the WBI activities have produced moderate impact. Using a&#13;
7-point scale (1=strong negative; 4=neutral; 7=strong positive), over 60 percent of&#13;
respondents rated changes brought by the WBI activity in the course/event topic areas as&#13;
positive.  Close to half of this group believe that the change is fairly strong. Few&#13;
participants felt that the changes were negative.                                                Finally, nearly nine percent of&#13;
participants answered "did not know". The mean rating of the impact is 5.1.&#13;

(mean=5.4), which are again concentrated at individual levels. Public awareness, which&#13;
shows the third most positive change, may be seen at both individual and community&#13;
levels.&#13;

4.17    Moreover, participants attending the focus group discussions stated that the WBI&#13;
training courses met the demand of Guatemala's development needs, and were relevant to&#13;
participants' professional development tasks.                        However, the instability or even non-&#13;
existence of a national policy in the sectors where they work or where they could&#13;
influence the most has made their contribution difficult. Government changes in 2004&#13;
have been crucial for most high-ranking officials, including those who attended the&#13;
courses in previous years. Without policy changes, even if most employees were selected&#13;
to be trained by their institutions, some governmental constraints would still exist.&#13;
However, participants felt that the education and research institutions are more flexible to&#13;
adopting or adapting some of the tools learned in their WBI learning activities.&#13;

                         FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PROGRAM OUTCOME&#13;
&#13;
4.18    A common Ordinary Least Squares and Two-Stage Least Squares regression&#13;
analyses were conducted to determine what factors influence participants' perception of&#13;
impact. Three models are examined in sequence: influences on effectiveness, influences&#13;
on utilization and influences on change (impact).                            Based on the findings from the&#13;
previous evaluation study, three groups of influencing variables were of primary interest&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                              24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for the evaluation: (i) the perceived relevance of the activity; (ii) course features; and (iii)&#13;
participant characteristics.3              In addition, the study extracts some results of Level 1&#13;
evaluation to explore their usefulness for the impact evaluation.4 A description of all&#13;
variables included in each category is summarized in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
       Model 1: effectiveness=f(perceived course relevance)+....&#13;
       Model 2: utilization=f(predicted perceived effectiveness)+...&#13;
       Model 3: change=f(predicted utilization)+...&#13;
&#13;
4.19      Considering the small number of respondents, the dependent variables&#13;
(effectiveness5, utilization and impact) were first correlated with relevant independent&#13;
variables to eliminate the total number of independent variables introduced into each of&#13;
the models.        For example, four independent or predictor variables are found to be&#13;
significantly correlated with effectiveness, the first dependent variable (see Table 8).&#13;
Each dependent variable was then regressed onto those variables shown to be&#13;
significantly correlated withit.&#13;
&#13;
Factors influencing the effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
4.20      Table 8 shows the regression results on effectiveness with the four relevant&#13;
variables. The results suggest that the perceived effectiveness cannot be explained by a&#13;
participant's assessment of whether he/she acquired new information from the event at&#13;
the time they attended the event (Level 1). Neither can it be explained by his/her&#13;
proficiency in language of instruction. Rather, the perceived effectiveness is enhanced&#13;
by the level of perceived relevance of the activity to the country's needs.&#13;

Factors influencing the utilization&#13;
&#13;
4.21     To simplify the analysis of predictors of utilization, in addition to constructing an&#13;
overall aggregated measure of use, two sub-dimensions of use were constructed as well:&#13;
use at individual level and use at organization/country level6. Table 9 shows the result of&#13;
the regression of utilization on the predicted effectiveness, plus three independent&#13;
variables that are correlated with this outcome (not the same three found for&#13;
effectiveness).          It shows that across all three aggregated use measures, the level of&#13;
utilization is significantly influenced by the predicted overall effectiveness of the WBI&#13;
event. Moreover, a positive country development environment predicts the utilization for&#13;
two of these three dependent variables, as does the course feature variable, development&#13;
of an action plan. The fourth predictor variable, working environment, is not found to&#13;
significantly affect the level of utilization.&#13;

Factors influencing the impact/changes&#13;
&#13;
4.22     Table 10 shows the results of the three separate regressions testing the influence&#13;
of the four variables correlated with impact (change). Notably, the perceived impact of&#13;
WBI intervention (measured in three dimensions ­ overall, individual and organization),&#13;
is significantly associated with the same utilization dimensions, i.e., individual use&#13;

where the event was held. In addition, no course features seem to have strong influence&#13;

and developing an action plan, coupled with a positive country environment can enhance&#13;
the utilization of knowledge and skill acquired from the learning event, which may then&#13;
lead to broader impact.&#13;

     Box 6: WBI Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala: Political influences on impact&#13;
&#13;
 In December 2002, Oscar Berger Perdomo, leader of the conservative Grand National Alliance party, won the&#13;
 presidency and changed the pace of the Guatemalan A-C project. The election brought in a new President as well&#13;
 as a different set of political actors.&#13;
 In February 2004, new members were elected for the Comision Coordinador to continue the implementation of&#13;
 the GAC diagnostics and A-C project. The field work began in May 2004 with a draft report following in October&#13;
 2004.&#13;
 In March 2004, newspaper Prensa Libre broadcasted a high level meeting of the WB with the new president and&#13;
 representatives from civil society in Guatemala. The objective of the meeting was to exchange the view of&#13;
 corruption issues with the new government, the nature and consequence of corruption, and to reinforce the&#13;
 government commitment to fighting corruption.&#13;
 Mass media and civil society groups continue to raise public knowledge on corruption issues. In recent articles of&#13;
 the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre from March 11 and 12 of 2004, there are reports that the United States&#13;
 denied nine visas to former President Portillo and several ex -ministers who have been accused of illegal activities&#13;
 and are still under investigation.&#13;
 In the context of this increasing public awareness and desire for government accountability, President Berger&#13;
 and his administration appear willing to continue supporting initiatives against corruption and for transparency.&#13;
 At the May meeting, officials recognized that initiatives such as the System Integrated of Financial&#13;
 Administration, the System BancaSAT and entru Guatecompras are achievements that already produce positive&#13;
 fruits. Meanwhile, the newly appointed presidential agent for Transparency, Carols Vielman, emphasized that the&#13;
 government finds "important coincidences among its plans and the approaches of the World Bank". It confirmed&#13;
 that a diagnosis of corruption will be carried out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   HOW TO SUSTAIN THE BUILT CAPACITY?&#13;
&#13;
4.24     The evaluation has revealed that WBI activities have brought some benefits to the&#13;
country, particularly to individuals. The next question is whether, and through what&#13;
mechanism, WBI has ensured and enhanced the sustainability of the built apacity. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
answer this question, the evaluation seeks past participants' experiences with WBI&#13;
follow-up activities and networking with other course participants.&#13;
&#13;
4.25    The evaluation reveals that WBI took little initiative to ensure the sustainability of&#13;
impact and that the level of facilitation of continued learning and exchange was low.&#13;
&#13;
4.26    Only a few survey respondents (n=9) experienced a follow up by WBI. Of the six&#13;
follow-up respondents who contacted WBI, four rated that WBI was very and extremely&#13;
useful.&#13;
&#13;
4.27    Over 50 percent (n=25) of the respondents said that they were provided with the&#13;
contact information of other participants during the learning event. However, 15 of them&#13;
never used it.    Eight people showed initiative in using this contact information to&#13;
continue activity-related discussion and two used it to organize follow-up activities.&#13;
&#13;
4.28    Consistent results are derived from the focus group discussion and interviews&#13;
with the WBI task managers. There was no WBI-initiated follow up after the event.&#13;
Focus group attendees noted that, while the WBI courses create national and international&#13;
networks between researchers and specialists working on the same issues, these&#13;
connections are not utilized after the event.      Participants strongly expected WBI to&#13;
facilitate the networking process.&#13;
&#13;
4.29    A lack of follow up with the participants after the activity may also explain why&#13;
both the WBI task managers and partners interviewed can not make any comments about&#13;
the impact of the event.&#13;
&#13;
                THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGEOF WBI IN GUATEMALA&#13;
&#13;
4.30    This section examines general perceptions of participants and Bank staff about&#13;
WBI's role in Guatemala, in comparison with other similar organizations/institutions.&#13;
&#13;
4.31    Of the participants surveyed and interviewed, only a few attended similar learning&#13;
events organized by other organizations/institutions. According to these participants,&#13;
WBI's comparative advantage in Guatemala is not apparent. The most prominent non-&#13;
WBI institutions in Guatemala that offer similar courses are the Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank (IADB) and the Swedish, Canadian, and Spanish cooperation&#13;
agencies. In the case of IADB, one participant mentioned that the difference is that after&#13;
trainees finish the course, IADB organizes monthly conferences about the topic covered&#13;
and invites trainees to attend them. They also believe that there is more flexibility with&#13;
other organizations/institutions in terms of being able to change some of the course&#13;
contents.&#13;
&#13;
4.32    Moreover, GDLN in Rafael Landivar University conducted an end course&#13;
evaluation for 15 courses delivered through the center in 2003. Of the 15 courses&#13;
evaluated, eight were organized by WBI. Figures 11, 12, and 13 present the comparison&#13;
of evaluation results using four indictors: quality of content, quality of methodology,&#13;
applicability of course to Guatemala, and overall satisfaction with the course.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
4.33    Despite the fact that participants gave a high rating to both WBI activities and&#13;
non-WBI activities, WBI receives more ratings of "excellent" for the quality of content&#13;
and methodology than non-WBI organizers. Applicability is perhaps not a very good&#13;
criterion, as, in principle, the course selected to broadcast by GDLN has to be relevant&#13;
and applicable to the country. Ratings of applicability are very high for both sources of&#13;
activities: all participants vote WBI activities applicable to the country, compared to 95&#13;
percent of participants for non-WBI activities.                     Finally, a similarly high number of&#13;
participants showed satisfaction with the courses organized by WBI and non-WBI, with&#13;
non-WBI only about 3 percentage points higher.&#13;
&#13;
4.34    All Bank staff interviewed (Operations and WBI task managers) agreed that WBI&#13;
is unique in Guatemala if it provides services that meet the country's needs. It is unique&#13;
in (a) providing knowledge products as a means to aid programs; (b) accessing and&#13;
connecting with international experts and new cutting-edge knowledge and technology;&#13;
and (c) providing a high quality product. However WBI has to be more flexible and is&#13;
willing to provide a range of products that are tailored according to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
           5. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
&#13;
5.1     By training and supporting key individuals in a country, WBI's objective is to&#13;
contribute to the country's development and poverty reduction. This evaluation examines&#13;
the extent to which this objective has been achieved in Guatemala. Focusing on WBI&#13;
activities carried out during the period of FY02 and FY03, the evaluation looks at both&#13;
the process and the impact of WBI programs in Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     The primary conclusion from this evaluation is that WBI programs have brought&#13;
some positive impact to Guatemala, but that the impact can be greater if WBI improves&#13;
the design and implementation of the programs offered. This conclusion is based on the&#13;
following key findings.&#13;
&#13;
                                       KEY FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
        · WBI activities in Guatemala were partially aligned with the Bank's assistance&#13;
            strategy. During the study period, there were a total of 33 Bank projects and&#13;
            57 WBI events for Guatemala. More that 700 participants were trained by&#13;
            WBI. By mapping the topic areas and size of the WBI events with the four&#13;
            CAS priority areas, WBI activities in Guatemala seem to be aligned partially&#13;
            with the Bank's assistance strategy, especially for the topics of Reducing&#13;
            Poverty and Improving Economic Management.              The areas where the&#13;
            alignment was least are Improving Governance and Public Sector&#13;
            Management, and Strengthening Participatory Decision-Making.&#13;
        · WBI activities offered were highly relevant to participants' work and to their&#13;
            country. Both the participant survey and the focus groups indicated that WBI&#13;
            activities delivered were highly relevant to their work and to their country&#13;
            (mean ratings=4.7 and 5.1, on a 7­point scale), but only moderately relevant&#13;
            to some country development goals. Among all activities in Guatemala, the&#13;
            Anti-Corruption Project has been regarded as "highly relevant" to the country&#13;
            by both the Bank Operations staff and client country.&#13;
        · WBI activities in Guatemala were not designed strategically at the country&#13;
            level. Despite some of alignment of WBI activities with the Bank's assistance&#13;
            strategy, by-and-large, WBI activities in Guatemala were not designed&#13;
            strategically at the country level, reflecting the stage of the country's&#13;
            development. Operations staff claimed that WBI had little flexibility on the&#13;
            offerings, and most activities were not tailored for the needs of the CAS and&#13;
            the choices were mainly supply-driven. This is perhaps due to the fact that&#13;
            Guatemala became a focus country after FY03, and for most non-WBI focus&#13;
            countries, global and regional approaches were still predominant in FY02 and&#13;
            FY03. On the other hand, most WBI activities were organized well at the&#13;
            event and activity levels. Some assessments were carried out to tailor the&#13;
            content of the activity to meet participants' needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   · The majority WBI activities were implemented independently in the country,&#13;
     facilitated through local individual partners. The evaluation reveals that most&#13;
     WBI activities were implemented independently in the country. More than 60&#13;
     percent of activities were delivered through local partners. However, the role&#13;
     of the local partners was limited to facilitation, logistical arrangement and&#13;
     participant recruitment. The Anti-Corruption Project in Guatemala is believed&#13;
     to be a very successful example of joint WBI and Operations implementation.&#13;
   · WBI activities were very effective in influencing individual knowledge and&#13;
     perceptions. Of the six effectiveness dimensions measured, the participants&#13;
     gave higher ratings for raising awareness, providing knowledge and skills, and&#13;
     helping understand the participant's role as agent (mean rating = 5.2 on a 7-&#13;
     point scale). The perceived activity effectiveness is seen to be positively&#13;
     influenced by the perceived relevance of the event to the country's needs.&#13;
   · Participants reported moderate utilization of knowledge and skills gained&#13;
     from WBI activities. The majority of survey respondents used knowledge and&#13;
     skills gained from the WBI activity at a moderate level (mean rating = 4.5, on&#13;
     a 7-point scale).    The utilization was strongest in teaching and research&#13;
     applications, followed by raising public awareness - all areas reflecting&#13;
     individual work and responsibility. Similar to the perceived effectiveness, the&#13;
     level of utilization at organizational and at country levels (e.g. influencing&#13;
     legislation or developing country strategy) is rather limited (mean ratings=3.7&#13;
     and 4.2).&#13;
   · The level of utilization of knowledge and skills is associated with having&#13;
     developed an action plan during the course, or having a positive country&#13;
     environment.&#13;
&#13;
   · WBI has brought some positive impact/changes. As reported by participants,&#13;
     WBI activities have brought a moderately positive change in the course topic&#13;
     areas (mean rating = 5.1 on a 7-point scale). However, the changes were seen&#13;
     greater at individual levels than at organizational and the country levels. The&#13;
     level of impact is found to be influenced by the level of utilization.&#13;
&#13;
   · Policy advisory support is seen as an effective intervention strategy in helping&#13;
     the country build capacity. The case study of the Anti-Corruption Project has&#13;
     demonstrated that policy advisory services as a non-traditional learning&#13;
     activity can be very effective in enhancing capacity, especially at country&#13;
     levels, through building the country's ownership and providing technical&#13;
     assistance. The degree of civil society involvement and having established a&#13;
     Memo of Understanding may suggest that the impact of the WBI intervention&#13;
     has gone beyond individual levels.&#13;
   · WBI made little effort to ensure the sustainability of built capacity. The&#13;
     evaluation shows that WBI took very little initiative to ensure sustainability of&#13;
     capacity that was built. The level of follow up and facilitation of continued&#13;
     learning for participants is low.&#13;
&#13;
   · WBI' s advantage in Guatemala is not apparent. The message from both&#13;
     participants and Operations staff interviews suggests that although WBI is&#13;
&#13;
31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            unique in providing cutting-edge and high quality knowledge products to the&#13;
            country, WBI has to be more flexible and should be willing to provide a range&#13;
            of products that are tailored according to the country's needs. Otherwise,&#13;
            WBI will not have apparent advantage in Guatemala.&#13;
&#13;
                                     LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
&#13;
5.3     Drawing on the findings, the evaluation offers several lessons that can be used by&#13;
WBI to improve its programs:&#13;
&#13;
5.4     The first lesson is that WBI can provide important technical assistance or more&#13;
direct knowledge products to the country, thus brining positive impact to the country.&#13;
The content relevance to participants and to the country is the key to the success of&#13;
programs offered. This is true regardless of kinds of activities, types of delivery modes&#13;
or location. WBI has done well in ensuring the relevance of learning events to individual&#13;
participants in Guatemala, and it should do more to ensure the relevance of WBI&#13;
activities to the country's needs. In this regard, CAS can be used as an instrument to&#13;
identify needs and to set priorities for the country programs. This lesson has been already&#13;
applied by WBI since Guatemala became a focus country and a new regional program&#13;
coordinator has been assigned. A strategic plan for Guatemala at the country level has&#13;
been developed for FY05 in consultation with the Operations team.&#13;
&#13;
5.5     The second lesson is that the influence of the WBI intervention cannot reach&#13;
maximum impact if it focuses only on a relatively small number of individual&#13;
participants. Within a given organization or institution there must be a critical mass of&#13;
participants in order to substantially influence policy. WBI needs to place more attention&#13;
to building institutional capacity in the country. This requires that WBI identifies the&#13;
institutions or organizations that are critical in influencing policy and ensures intensive&#13;
and widespread training within those institutions or organizations.&#13;
&#13;
5.6     The third lesson is that program impact can be enhanced strategically by:&#13;
        · Designing and implementing programs jointly with Operations.                 The&#13;
            experience of the Anti-Corruption Project clearly shows that the involvement&#13;
            of Operations is extremely helpful in moving the project forward.&#13;
        · Promoting country-and particularly government­ownership of the activity.&#13;
            Again, the experience of the Anti-Corruption Project shows how government&#13;
            ownership of the intervention activity can influence the progress and the&#13;
            impact of the intervention.&#13;
&#13;
5.7     The fourth lesson is that program impact can be enhanced technically by:&#13;
&#13;
        · using an action planning during the learning event; and&#13;
        · using the non-traditional learning approach of policy advice services.&#13;
&#13;
5.8     The final lesson is that program impact cannot be sustained without the&#13;
continuing involvement and effort of WBI. A strong voice heard from the focus group is&#13;
that WBI needs to take the initiative to follow up and to facilitate continued learning and&#13;
networking after the event is over.&#13;

        ANNEX 6A: REVIEW OF ALIGNMENT OF WBI ACTIVITIES&#13;
               WITH WB COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGIES&#13;
&#13;
The following examines the critical issues in Guatemala, the World Bank Group's efforts&#13;
to meet the development priorities, and then assesses the degree of alignment between&#13;
WBI activities in FY02-03 and WB efforts. The first section describes the critical issues&#13;
that were identified by the Guatemalan government in the 2002 Guatemala PRSP. The&#13;
second section uses the 1998 Guatemala CAS and 2002 CAS Progress Report to describe&#13;
the issues that the WB tried to address through its lending and non-lending products, and&#13;
explains how those efforts aligned with the priorities of the PRSP. The final section uses&#13;
the 2004 CBP and information from the Business Warehouse to describe and assess the&#13;
level of alignment that WBI activities had with WB products.&#13;
&#13;
                       THE CRITICAL ISSUES IN GUATEMALA (PRSP)&#13;
&#13;
The 1996 Peace Accords ended 36 years of armed conflict within Guatemala. The&#13;
fundamental cause of the conflict has been widely attributed to the historical pattern of&#13;
exclusion, particularly with regards to indigenous groups. This prevented the majority of&#13;
citizens from improving their economic standing, gaining access to social services, and&#13;
playing a significant role in their own development. The Peace Accords therefore placed&#13;
poverty reduction at the forefront of the national agenda in order to build a more&#13;
equitable and inclusive society. The Guatemala PRSP aims to reconcile the past by&#13;
focusing the national agenda on three primary pillars: economic growth with equity,&#13;
investment in human capital, and investment in physical capital.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Growth with Equity&#13;
&#13;
The Guatemala PRSP asserts that the country must achieve stronger economic growth in&#13;
order to achieve the underlying goal of reducing poverty. Although Guatemala has had&#13;
surprisingly solid economic growth for a historically exclusive society, the growth rates&#13;
have not been sufficient to benefit the poor. Guatemala has one of the highest poverty&#13;
rates in Latin America, and continues to put the majority of the burden on rural&#13;
communities with 81 percent the poor and 93 percent of those in extreme poverty living&#13;
in the countryside. The strategies for improving economic growth include: maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability, reforming the financial sector, reorienting public expenditures&#13;
to the social sectors and infrastructure, and promoting agricultural and rural development.&#13;
&#13;
Investment in Human Capital&#13;
&#13;
The second pillar of the PRSP focuses on building human capital while targeting the&#13;
poorest citizens.   Investments are concentrated on the areas of greatest need which&#13;
includes health, education, and food security. Guatemala has some of the worst health&#13;
facilities in Latin America, the lowest life expectancy, and highest maternal and infant&#13;
mortality. The national interventions aim to extend coverage of basic health services,&#13;
improve access to the services, and strengthen health promoting and disease prevention&#13;
services. In education, Guatemala ranks third from last for illiteracy. Investments are&#13;
targeted at increasing net enrollment in pre- and primary schools, and reducing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
illiteracy rate. In regards to food security, the focus is again on the poor and excluded,&#13;
who are highly dependant on agriculture.         Women and indigenous populations in&#13;
particular have limited opportunities and face discrimination in the labor market.&#13;
Furthermore, land ownership in Guatemala is one of the most unequal in the world which&#13;
constrains investment.&#13;
&#13;
Investment in Physical Capital&#13;
&#13;
The third pillar invests in the physical infrastructure of Guatemala's poorest and most&#13;
remote areas. The areas of priority include: water supply, basic sanitation, roads, and&#13;
energy. Progress has been evident in water supply and electricity, with 70 percent of&#13;
households having piped water and electricity. Sanitation is mixed, with 90 percent&#13;
having some kind of basic sanitation but fewer than half having access to sewage&#13;
systems. The roads are especially deficient in the rural areas, which constrains access to&#13;
markets and basic services.&#13;
&#13;
Additional areas of need&#13;
&#13;
As part of Guatemala's efforts to reduce poverty and build social inclusion, three&#13;
additional areas of need are outlined in the PRSP yet do not fall neatly into the primary&#13;
pillars: public sector modernization, governance, and decentralization and participation.&#13;
Progress in modernizing the public sector includes instituting an integrated financial&#13;
management system within all ministries to improve management, such as with tax&#13;
collection and transparency. In the area of Governance, the PRSP includes actions to&#13;
combat corruption and improve transparency, which are expected to supplement and&#13;
enhance the influence of efforts at the public sector. Finally, decentralization and&#13;
participation will be the means of expanding coverage to the rural populations. It will&#13;
enable traditionally excluded groups to take ownership over program design and&#13;
oversight, which simultaneously empowers them to drive development in their own&#13;
communities and strengthen expenditure management.&#13;
&#13;
                   ISSUES THE WORLD BANK GROUP TRIED TO ADDRESS&#13;
&#13;
Subsequent to the 1996 Peace Accords, the World Bank Group's assistance intensified&#13;
during the implementation of the CAS strategy from 1998 to 2001. The 2002 CAS&#13;
Progress Report builds on the foundation laid in the 1998 CAS, which shared the national&#13;
PRSP goals of reducing poverty and building a more inclusive society. The CAS has&#13;
four interlinked development priorities that closely mirror, though do not perfectly align&#13;
with, the pillars of the PRSP:&#13;
        · Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion.&#13;
&#13;
        · Strengthening social cohesion and participatory decision processes.&#13;
        · Improving economic management to maintain macroeconomic stability and&#13;
            foster growth.&#13;
        · Improving governance and public sector management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The World Bank's products are designed to make progress in the priority areas, and are&#13;
composed of lending and non-lending products. The lending products are long-term&#13;
projects that can last many years and include large loans. The non-lending products are&#13;
learning and research-based activities that involve less funding and are typically shorter&#13;
in duration. There were a total number of 24 active lending products during FY02-03&#13;
that comprised a total of $760,500,000. During the same period, there were nine non-&#13;
lending products in the amount of $731,000.&#13;
&#13;
Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion&#13;
&#13;
This first development goal is broken down into four sub-priorities which cut across&#13;
several of the PRSP priorities. First, the CAS seeks to induce economic growth and&#13;
create income-generating opportunities for rural populations much in the same way the&#13;
PRSP seeks economic growth with equity by promoting agricultural and rural&#13;
development. Bank lending projects that aligned with this priority include the Land&#13;
Administration and Land Fund Projects. Second, the CAS promotes more effective and&#13;
far reaching social programs, while the PRSP seeks to reorient public expenditures to the&#13;
social sectors and invest in human capital by focusing in food security, education, and&#13;
health. Lending products that aligned with this priority include the Universalization of&#13;
Basic Education Project and the Social Investment Fund Project. The third priority&#13;
focused on ensuring effective delivery of social services targeted at the poorest, which&#13;
aligns with the PRSP's goal of reorienting public expenditures to the social sector.&#13;
Lending activities tied to this priority include the Reconstruction and Local Development&#13;
Project and the Poverty Analysis, Policy Formulation and Monitoring Evaluation Project.&#13;
There are also five non-lending products in this area. The fourth priority seeks to foster&#13;
rapid improvements in infrastructure, and promote better functioning markets and rural&#13;
financial systems. This aligns with the PRSP priority of investing in physical capital&#13;
among poorest areas, and extending coverage of infrastructure in the sectors of water,&#13;
sanitation, roads, and energy. Lending projects that align with this priority include the&#13;
Rural and Main Roads Project, the Western Altiplano Natural Resources Management&#13;
Project, Community Management of the Bio-Itza Reserve, and the Management and&#13;
Protection of Languna del Tigre Project.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening social cohesion and participatory decision processes&#13;
&#13;
This second development goal of the CAS focuses on improved targeting of government&#13;
spending, aiding poorer communities, and empowering them to take greater control over&#13;
their own development. This aligns with the decentralization and participation priority of&#13;
the PRSP, which seeks to improve targeting, increase community ownership of program&#13;
design, and strengthen participatory expenditure management. Bank lending products&#13;
that aligned with these priorities include the Second Rural and Main Roads Project and&#13;
the Strengthening the Ombudsman Office for Indigenous Women within the Guatemala&#13;
Government Project.     Other relevant lending products that also address that cut across&#13;
additional development priorities include the Universalization of Basic Education Project,&#13;
Community Management of the Bio-Itza Reserve Project, and the Land Administration&#13;
and Land Fund Projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Improving economic management to maintain macroeconomic stability and foster&#13;
growth&#13;
&#13;
This third development goal of the CAS seeks to maintain a stable macroeconomic&#13;
environment. This aligns with the imbedded priorities of the PRSP pillar of Economic&#13;
Growth with Equity. The first imbedded priority is maintaining macroeconomic stability.&#13;
Lending products that aligned with this priority include the Competitiveness Project and&#13;
Private Participation in Infrastructure Project. The second imbedded priority is instituting&#13;
reforms to strengthen the financial sector. The lending products that align with this&#13;
include the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan and the Financial Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan. There were four non-lending products that supported this development&#13;
goal.&#13;
&#13;
Improving governance and public sector management&#13;
&#13;
This fourth overarching development goal of the CAS focuses on reforms that combat&#13;
corruption and misuse of public funds. It seeks to concentrate these reforms in the areas&#13;
of the financial sector, tax administration, public sector procurement, and the judicial&#13;
sector. The PRSP pillar of Economic Growth with Equity and the imbedded priority of&#13;
reforming and strengthening the financial sector is in alignment with the lending product&#13;
Integrated Financial Management III. The PRSP's pillar of Public Sector Modernization&#13;
has two priorities that align with relevant Bank lending products. The first is combating&#13;
corruption and improving transparency, which is aligned with the Judicial Reform&#13;
Project.   The second priority is modernizing institutions in the public sector by&#13;
integrating financial management systems and strengthening tax collection mechanisms.&#13;
This is in alignment with the Bank lending product entitled Tax Administration Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan Project.&#13;
&#13;
             WBI ACTIVITY ALIGNMENT WITHTHE BANK'S INTERVENTIONS&#13;
&#13;
The goals outlined by the CAS along with Bank products clearly have strong alignment&#13;
with the goals stated in the Guatemala PRSP. This section examines the degree to which&#13;
WBI activities appear to align with the World Bank Group's products during the fiscal&#13;
years of 2002 and 2003. WBI activities are mapped into two categories: those held&#13;
within Guatemala, and those held out-of-country that included Guatemalan participants.&#13;
The WBI activities and Bank products are mapped under the four CAS priorities and&#13;
within the major WBI classifications. So, for example, the Universalization of Education&#13;
lending product is mapped under the "Reducing Poverty and Social Inclusion" CAS&#13;
priority, and further mapped under the WBI "Education Program" classification. This&#13;
helps broadly reveal which lending and WBI activities address specific CAS priorities&#13;
while gaining additional insights in the area of focus.&#13;
&#13;
Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion&#13;
&#13;
Since poverty reduction is the centerpiece of Guatemala's development agenda, this&#13;
development priority overall has the greatest number of WB products and WBI activities:&#13;
10 lending products, five non-lending products, six in-country WBI activities, and 21 out-&#13;
of-country WBI activities with Guatemalan participants. Breaking this development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
priority down by WBI classification reveals that there were no Bank products or WBI&#13;
activities in the City and Urban Management classification. This makes sense since the&#13;
focus for this priority is on the rural communities. There appears to still be a level of&#13;
demand in this area, however, as there were two WBI activities held out-of-country that&#13;
included Guatemalan participants. Similarly, in the area of Water Programs there were&#13;
neither in-country WBI activities or Bank products.           The same is true for Health,&#13;
Nutrition and Population excepting for one non-lending product. As with the Water&#13;
Program, Guatemalan participants were involved in out-of-country WBI activities. What&#13;
is different about the lack of activities and products in these classifications is that they are&#13;
more in line with the priorities stated in both the CAS and the PRSP, which seek to build&#13;
rural access to clean water and health services.&#13;
&#13;
In the WBI classifications of Education Programs and Poverty and Growth&#13;
classifications, there were both WBI activities held within Guatemala as well as Bank&#13;
lending products. In the Education Programs classification, the Universalization of Basic&#13;
Education lending product is aligned with four WBI activities aimed at the education&#13;
sector. There were no Guatemalan participants involved with Education activities held&#13;
outside of Guatemala. In Poverty and Growth there are two active lending and four non-&#13;
lending products that are aligned with two WBI activities. There were also six WBI&#13;
activities held outside of the country that included Guatemalan participants.&#13;
&#13;
There are three WBI classifications in which there were Bank products yet no WBI&#13;
activities within Guatemala: Environment and Natural Resources, Rural Poverty and&#13;
Development, and Social Protection and Risk Management. The Environment and Rural&#13;
Poverty and Development classifications each had three lending products. Furthermore,&#13;
there appears to have been a significant level of demand for Environment, as there were&#13;
nine out-of-country WBI activities with Guatemalan participants. The Social Protection&#13;
classification had only one lending product and there were no out-of-country WBI&#13;
activities that were attended by Guatemalans.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening social cohesion and participatory decision processes&#13;
&#13;
Both the CAS and PRSP stated poverty reduction to be the primary goal, which is&#13;
strongly tied to the goal of building social inclusion.           The WBI classification of&#13;
Community Empowerment and Social Inclusion was the only classification that aligned&#13;
with this development priority. There were seven lending products in this classification,&#13;
yet only one WBI activity was held in Guatemala (FY2003). Furthermore, there were no&#13;
Guatemalan participants involved in WBI activities held outside of the country in this&#13;
area. This could be interpreted as a lack of demand, or more likely, a lack of opportunity&#13;
for the poor to be involved in activities of this sort due to financial constraints.&#13;
&#13;
Improving economic management to maintain macroeconomic stability and foster&#13;
growth&#13;
&#13;
Under this CAS priority, there were a total of four lending products, four non-lending&#13;
products, two in-country WBI activities, and nine out-of-country WBI activities with&#13;
Guatemalan participants. There were four WBI classifications under this development&#13;
priority: Financial Sector Policy Outreach, Private Sector Development, Public-Private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Partnerships in Infrastructure, and Trade.     The Financial Sector and Private Sector&#13;
classifications each had lending products, no WBI in-country activities, and no&#13;
Guatemalan participants attending WBI activities held out-of-country. More specifically,&#13;
the Financial Sector had two lending products, three non-lending products, and one&#13;
external WBI activity with Guatemalan participants (2002). The Private Sector has one&#13;
lending product, one non-lending product, and seven out-of-country WBI activities. The&#13;
Public-Private Partnership had one lending product and one WBI activity in Guatemala.&#13;
In the area of Trade, there were no lending activities, one in-country WBI activity, and&#13;
one out-of-country WBI activity with Guatemalan participants.&#13;
&#13;
Improving governance and public sector management&#13;
&#13;
This fourth development priority had a total of three lending products, no non-lending&#13;
products, six in-country WBI activities, and six out-of country activities with Guatemalan&#13;
participants.  There were two WBI classifications which appear to be least aligned:&#13;
Governance and the Public Sector. Governance had one lending product, four in-country&#13;
WBI activities, and four out-of-country WBI activities with Guatemalan participants.&#13;
The Public Sector had two lending products, two in-country WBI activities, and two out-&#13;
of-country WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
                                CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
&#13;
The level of alignment between WBI activities in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 with the&#13;
Bank's lending products appears to be somewhat mixed.             In regards to the four&#13;
overarching CAS development priorities, there seems to be good alignment. The first&#13;
development priority of Reducing Poverty had a total of ten lending products, five non-&#13;
lending products, six in-country WBI activities, and twenty one out-of-country WBI&#13;
activities. The second development priority of Strengthening Participation marked the&#13;
least alignment of the four with seven lending products, no non-lending products, one in-&#13;
country WBI activity, and no out-of-country WBI activities. The third development&#13;
priority of Improving Economic Management and Growth had four lending products,&#13;
four non-lending products, two in-country WBI activities, and nine out-of-country WBI&#13;
activities. The fourth development priority had three lending products, no non-lending&#13;
products, six in-country WBI activities, and six out-of country activities.&#13;
&#13;
Beyond the four overarching development priorities of the CAS, the extent to wich WBI&#13;
activities are aligned with Bank lending products becomes more questionable to the&#13;
degree of precision. Using the criteria of WBI classification, of the fourteen categories,&#13;
only half were aligned between Bank lending/non-lending products and in-country WBI&#13;
activities. That is, if a WBI classification did or did not have a lending/non-lending&#13;
product, seven times out of fourteen WBI activities followed suit. Therefore there were&#13;
also seven classifications in which there either was a WBI activity but no lending/non-&#13;
lending product, or there was a lending/non-lending product and no in-country WBI&#13;
activity to complement it. In sum, the WBI activities in 2002-2003 seem generally&#13;
aligned in support of CAS objectives and Bank lending/non-lending products, however&#13;
the extent of precision remains questionable.&#13;

            Country focus evaluation of WBI client
            activities in FY02-03, Guatemala : A baseline assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            By training and supporting key
            individuals in a country, WBI expects to contribute to the
            country's development and poverty reduction. This
            evaluation examines the extent to which this expectation has
            been achieved in Guatemala. Focusing on WBI activities
            carried out during the period of FY02 and FY03, this
            evaluation assesses both the process and the impact of WBI
            programs in Guatemala. The process evaluation addresses how
            WBI sets strategic directions, designs and implements
            learning activities for the country. The evaluation looks at
            the relevance of WBI activities in terms of addressing key
            issues of the country, the level of the alignment with the
            Bank's assistance strategy for Guatemala and the
            program implementation. The impact evaluation considers the
            outcome of a WBI intervention, i.e., the extent to which it
            has met its activity and program objectives.
