&amp;#12;&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. The Conflict and its Consequences&#13;
1.    Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest-suffering countries among the members of the&#13;
World Bank. An estimated 7 million people remain vulnerable to hunger and very large numbers are&#13;
dependent on a massive inflow of food and humanitarian aid. Afghanistan's infrastructure has been&#13;
destroyed or degraded; its human resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded. State&#13;
institutions are largely nonfunctional, and the economy and society have become increasingly fragmented.&#13;
2.     September 11, 2001 precipitated wholesale changes in the political and military situation in&#13;
Afghanistan, transforming the overall context for national reconstruction and for World Bank support to&#13;
Afghanistan. The collapse of the Taliban regime was followed by the conclusion on December 5, 2001,&#13;
in Bonn, Germany, of the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-&#13;
establishment of Permanent Government Institutions (a.k.a. the Bonn Agreement), an agreement among&#13;
the different groups in opposition to the Taliban regime on a new structure of government and a process&#13;
that would lead to the election of a fully representative government within a period of about 2 and 1/2&#13;
years.&#13;
3.     The Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) is part of the Afghanistan Interim Authority&#13;
which is expected to remain in power for six months. Fully vested with the sovereign functions of&#13;
government, the Afghanistan Interim Authority peacefully took over central administration on December&#13;
22, 2001. An emergency Loya Jirga will take place in June 2002. The Loya Jirga will decide on a&#13;
Transitional Authority that is expected to pave the way for a new constitution and an elected, fully&#13;
representative government for Afghanistan within two years. The Interim Authority has the power to&#13;
repeal and amend laws and regulations by decree.&#13;
4.     The AIA has moved quickly to restore basic government functions and reestablish international&#13;
relations. However, expectations among the population for a "peace dividend" are high, and if the AIA&#13;
and its successor do not deliver results relatively quickly, the prospects for further progress and the peace&#13;
process will dim.&#13;
5.     Despite being hampered by very limited capacity and the difficult security situation in many parts&#13;
of the country, the AIA has made considerable progress and has gained widespread international&#13;
recognition and some moral authority. The AIA has also presented a draft National Development&#13;
Framework to the Interim Donors Group in April 2, 2002, which laid out the AIA' s development strategy.&#13;
6.     Beyond popular expectations for a peace dividend, major infrastructure bottlenecks will need to&#13;
be removed in order to stimulate early economic recovery and growth. War has not only devastated&#13;
Afghanistan's existing infrastructure but prevented new investment from taking place. Immediate&#13;
challenges include repairing urban piped water, sanitation systems and other essential urban&#13;
infrastructure, restoring essential electric power supplies, establishing communications systems, removing&#13;
major transport bottlenecks and re-establishing safe emergency air traffic services.&#13;
B. Features of the Existing Infrastructure Sector&#13;
7.     Urban infrastructure. During this period of massive population movement under war conditions,&#13;
existing urban infrastructure not only failed to match the increasing demands, but actually deteriorated&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
owing to lack of maintenance and outright destruction. Street lighting has almost disappeared. Public&#13;
buildings such as markets, municipal offices, workshops and depots lie damaged and have been looted of&#13;
all tools and equipment. About a quarter of urban housing has been seriously damaged or destroyed, and&#13;
about 40 percent of housing units are in unplanned areas. Urban management capacity has been&#13;
decimated. Urban water supply and sanitation, solid waste management and storm water drainage&#13;
facilities are in urgent need of repair. Access to adequate and safe water and sanitation facilities is limited&#13;
although in some areas NGOs and communities have improved conditions. Currently an estimated 23&#13;
percent of the population has access to safe water, although this masks wide differences among provinces&#13;
and districts. Coverage is poor, less than 20 percent of Kabul's population has access to piped water and&#13;
many provincial and secondary towns have no networked services. Many urban families lack access to&#13;
safe sanitation. Hygiene education accompanying water supply installation has been introduced by some&#13;
NGOs, but coverage remains limited. Water borne diseases are a major cause of the prevailing high&#13;
infant and child mortality rates. Approximately 85,000 children under age five die annually from&#13;
diarrheal diseases. Few residential or public buildings in Afghan cities have sewerage systems, and those&#13;
that do, discharge wastewater directly into rivers without treatment. In 1997, sanitation coverage was&#13;
estimated to be 23 percent of the urban population and 8 percent of the rural population.&#13;
8.     Power. The vast majority of the Afghan population relies on traditional household fuels (wood,&#13;
bushes, crop residues and animal waste) for its energy needs. There are reports of over-exploitation of&#13;
forestry resources and non-sustainable production and use of firewood leading to deforestation and severe&#13;
environmental degradation in many areas. The current situation poses a disproportional burden on&#13;
women and children, for example, in terms of gathering of fuel wood and exposure to pollution from&#13;
cooking stoves. Only about 4 percent of the population is reported to have access to electricity, but the&#13;
faltering supply is limited to the larger urban areas. The existing network is characterized by (a) daily&#13;
rationing of electricity - in Kabul, about half of the consumers are provided with electricity on alternative&#13;
evenings; (b) an almost total lack of offices, workshops and stores facilities due to buildings having been&#13;
destroyed totally or partially; (c) the absence of conductors and insulators, which have been stolen from&#13;
many overhead transmission and distribution lines; (d) high technical losses caused by poorly repaired&#13;
transmission and distribution lines; (e) inadequate outdated generation and substation plant and&#13;
equipment, for which spares will be difficult and expensive to acquire; (f) a lack of all consumables,&#13;
including even simple cleaning rags, stationary, and light bulbs; (g) an absence of hand tools, modern&#13;
workshop and laboratory equipment and vehicles; (h) no communications equipment or computers; and&#13;
(i) an enthusiastic MOP staff, most of whom are close to retirement, and who have been out of touch with&#13;
many of the latest developments in the power sector industry.&#13;
9.     Mining, Oil &amp; Gas. The infrastructure of the country's commercial energy sector is in disarray,&#13;
caused by a combination of the direct effects of the wars that have blighted Afghanistan, and by&#13;
subsequent pillages of much of the sector equipment. Exports of natural gas stopped in the late eighties.&#13;
The two producing gas fields in the north that remain have depleted over the years and the combined&#13;
remaining reserves are now estimated to be about 15 billion cubic meters. The current gas production is&#13;
about 550,000 cubic meter per day, which is one fourth of the production in the 1980s. Seventy percent of&#13;
current production is used in a fertilizer factory and power plant. Transmission and distribution pipelines&#13;
have corroded and about 30 percent of gas is being lost due to leakage. All gas facilities are in a&#13;
desperate need of rehabilitation and apart from a loss of revenue, pose a major safety hazard. In the&#13;
mining sector, the situation is not much better. Ineffective legislation and weak public sector institutions&#13;
limit the ability of the central government to exert sovereignty over mineral resources and to mobilize&#13;
investment for their development. While some geological survey work has been conducted in the past,&#13;
the large laboratory of the geological survey department has been completely destroyed. The existing&#13;
coal mines are hardly operational. Semi precious gem stones and industrial minerals are being&#13;
inefficiently mined but detailed information is not available.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.    Communications. Twenty years of conflict in one of the poorest countries in the world has left&#13;
Afghanistan with a barely functioning and limited communications sector. Adding together the analogue&#13;
and wireless local loop networks suggests a country teledensity on the order of 2 telephones per 1,000 (14&#13;
phones per 1,000 in Kabul, 0.6 phones per 1,000 in the rest of the country). A number of fixed lines&#13;
remain operational in Kabul although the analogue and digital networks are not interconnected. A&#13;
number of private companies were offering satellite telephony in various cities. In April 2002, a private/&#13;
government joint venture began telecom operations in Kabul. International access and internet services&#13;
are expected to be available in May 2002. Radio and television broadcasting facilities are very limited,&#13;
and there is no functioning system to provide information to rural and displaced groups on sources of&#13;
support, weather, and emergencies. In 1999, there were only three radio stations operating in the country,&#13;
only one is operating today, with a broadcast footprint that only covers the province of Kabul.&#13;
11.   Roads. Roads provide the principal means of transport for both internal and international traffic.&#13;
The road network comprises about 5,800 kilometers (km) of national roads, of which 3,100 km are&#13;
primary highways including 2,400 km roads that were originally paved. The national primary road&#13;
network largely consists of the ring road (Herat-Kandahar-Kabul-Mazar-i Sharif-Shibergan-Maimana-&#13;
Herat) and the six international links to neighboring countries. The remaining network of 2,700 km&#13;
secondary national roads and 15,000 km provincial roads is either gravel or earthen. The coverage and&#13;
condition details of tertiary road network consisting of village access roads is not known, except that&#13;
these roads are all unpaved. More than two decades of conflict combined with a prolonged lack of&#13;
maintenance has resulted in damages to long sections of roads, critical structures, bridges and other&#13;
structures.  Overall, the road network has been rendered only partially usable and that too at a&#13;
significantly high transportation cost. According to the last condition survey undertaken in 1994, 17&#13;
percent of the network was in good condition, 35 percent in fair condition and the remaining 48 percent in&#13;
poor condition. Based on recent visits to some sections of the network, the road conditions have&#13;
deteriorated significantly.&#13;
C. AIA Response and Strategy&#13;
12.   The formal infrastructure sector in Afghanistan is currently largely owned and operated through&#13;
centralized ministries, with some operational and production functions delegated to government&#13;
enterprises. The reach of formal services is, however, very limited. In the urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation sectors, there is already substantial private participation in service delivery mainly through&#13;
communities, NGOs and UN agencies. In rural areas, NGOs and communities have been and are likely to&#13;
remain the core providers of infrastructure services. The AIA has stated it will encourage scaling up of&#13;
community-based, decentralized approaches to improve and expand the delivery of infrastructure&#13;
services. It also plans to open up the infrastructure sectors to private participation and investment,&#13;
starting with the telecommunication and oil and gas sectors.&#13;
13.   Attracting sustainable and efficient private participation in the infrastructure sectors will require,&#13;
first of all, a sound general business environment characterized by well-defined property rights, rule of&#13;
law, and open entry. For those parts of the infrastructure sectors characterized by monopoly power,&#13;
attention will also be needed to create a suitable regulatory framework. It will, however, take time to&#13;
formulate and obtain consensus on new policy frameworks, modify legislation and regulations, achieve&#13;
financial sustainability and reorganize the sectors. The AIA therefore favors a parallel approach of using&#13;
existing government structures to supervise or implement emergency repairs and reconstruction work&#13;
while maximizing the use of service delivery schemes that involve communities and the local private&#13;
sector, and working towards the policy and structural changes appropriate for each sector.&#13;
14.   In proceeding with this parallel approach, the AIA recognizes the risk of developing large and&#13;
inefficient public sector in-house construction and operations departments and public enterprises.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Functional arrangements and processes put in place to facilitate emergency reconstruction should not be&#13;
in conflict with the AlA's medium- to long-term vision for service provision in the infrastructure sectors.&#13;
Therefore a strategic priority is to identify medium- to long-term options for service delivery.&#13;
15.    The ALA will launch a number of critical initiatives over the next three months to commence&#13;
reconstruction. The focus is on projects that are quick to implement, that address major bottlenecks to the&#13;
reconstruction effort, and that do not create barriers to the future emergence of private sector- and&#13;
community-led infrastructure service provision.&#13;
D. Sector Specific Vision&#13;
16.    Urban. Afghanistan's urban vision is for well functioning cities with inclusive, efficient, and&#13;
self-sustaining management systems, operated by municipalities in close collaboration with residents.&#13;
Municipalities would be the principal actors for reconstruction of the urban environment. To the extent&#13;
possible, urban services will be expanded into new and informal areas by integrating, formal service&#13;
delivery with community interventions, ensuring that all citizens can engage effectively in city&#13;
governance. Investments in private facilities, such as houses, will be the responsibility of families and&#13;
communities, while public infrastructure (urban roads, sanitation, public parks, etc.) will be the&#13;
responsibility of municipalities and carried out through local contractors or labor based contracts.&#13;
Flexible urban planning to facilitate appropriate development of housing and municipal services is a&#13;
priority need. Ultimately urban reconstruction and development activities will need to take place in the&#13;
context of strengthened capacity and greater financial autonomy at the municipal level.&#13;
17.   Urban Water Supply. The delivery of urban water supply presents particular challenges and&#13;
opportunities. The nodal agency, the Central Authority for Water Supply and Sewerage (CAWSS), lacks&#13;
resources to move back into its role as a central implementer of investments. Experience from other&#13;
countries suggests that a more effective institutional model would be for decentralized service delivery&#13;
with an increased role for the private sector (building initially from the existing base of small-scale&#13;
contractors, NGOs and UN agencies). Municipalities are likely to play a key role in ensuring service&#13;
delivery at the city level. The central government and CAWSS would then move into a more facilitating&#13;
role, developing appropriate policy and regulatory instruments and overseeing the delivery of sustainable&#13;
water supply and sanitation within an agreed framework of technical, social and environmental standards.&#13;
18.   Power. The AIA's vision for the power sector is to encourage community service delivery,&#13;
particularly in rural areas, and encourage local and foreign private investors to provide services at least&#13;
cost in an environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable way. Government would withdraw from&#13;
implementation of investment projects and operations while keeping responsibility for policy making and&#13;
putting in place an appropriate regulatory framework. As a first step, the AIA plans, over the next few&#13;
months, to bring the semi-autonomous "enterprises" reporting to the Ministry of Water and Power under a&#13;
new framework of company law reflecting the Constitutional Law of 1964 which would provide them&#13;
with real autonomy. The AIA intends to privatize the Power Construction Unit and the Spinghar&#13;
Construction Unit (which deal with electrical and mechanical installation and civil construction activities,&#13;
respectively) as soon as possible. The options for further restructuring and possible privatization of Da&#13;
Afghanistan Breshna Moassesa (DABM - the power utility), which is responsible for operation and&#13;
maintenance of the system throughout the country, will need some further study, but it is expected to be&#13;
implemented in the near future.&#13;
19.   Oil, Gas and Mining. In the mining and oil and gas sectors, the AIA envisions the development&#13;
of the country's considerable hydrocarbon and mineral potential to supply the needs of the domestic&#13;
market, to export and to generate revenue for the benefit of its population. As the resources required for&#13;
development of this potential vastly exceeds available budgetary resources, and since recognition is given&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to the positive role the private sector can play, AIA seeks to establish as soon as possible an enabling&#13;
environment that would attract investments from both local and international private investors. This&#13;
requires the strengthening of government institutions which must be equipped with logistical support and&#13;
qualified manpower to enable them to effectively promote, control, manage and monitor Afghanistan's&#13;
hydrocarbon and mining resources.  The AIA recognizes that the development of the enabling&#13;
environment and the appropriate institutions will take time, but given its revenue and employment&#13;
generation potential attaches high priority to this activity.&#13;
20.    Telecommunication. Even before the AIA was installed, private investors, in joint venture with&#13;
the Ministry of Telecommunications, had initiated mobile telephone systems on a modest scale.&#13;
Recently, one of these joint ventures, previously active in the North, has started to operate services in&#13;
Kabul. The AIA is in the process of formulating a new telecommunications policy which would allow&#13;
entry of other private operators, both in mobile and other telecommunication services such as internet.&#13;
New licenses and other regulations are already being formulated and new operators will be invited on a&#13;
competitive basis.&#13;
II. IDA'S RESPONSE&#13;
A. Afghanistan's Relations with IDA&#13;
21.    Afghanistan is a member of IDA, IFC, IMF, and ADB. Afghanistan became a member of the&#13;
IMF and World Bank in 1955. IDA has provided 21 development credits to Afghanistan since 1964 in a&#13;
wide range of sectors including education, roads and agricultural activities. Of the original US$230&#13;
million approved by IDA for Afghanistan, US$83 million was disbursed and US$147 million was&#13;
subsequently canceled. IDA operations were suspended shortly after the 1979 Soviet invasion of&#13;
Afghanistan, and the Resident Mission in Kabul was closed. Afghanistan has repaid US$9.2 million to&#13;
IDA and was up to date on debt service payments until June 1992, when the country went into non-&#13;
accrual status. Lending operations remained suspended due to the continuing fighting, absence of a&#13;
national government, and Afghanistan's entry into non-accrual status with IDA.&#13;
22.    Afghanistan's Arrears to International Financial Institutions. Resuming normal financial&#13;
relations with the IFIs will require Afghanistan to clear outstanding arrears which total, as of January 31,&#13;
2002, around US$51 million including US$25.2 million to IDA, about US$16 million to the ADB, and&#13;
US$9.8 million to the IMF. The AIA is committed to clearing its arrears to IDA by the end of the&#13;
summer, which will set the stage for a resumption of normal relations with IDA.&#13;
23.   IDA has not extended any credits to Afghanistan since 1979 although it has remained engaged&#13;
with the assistance community. Efforts included continuous monitoring of political and economic&#13;
developments; managing selective investments in the Afghan refugee communities; working closely with&#13;
the UN and donors; undertaking knowledge-building and knowledge-sharing activities; and providing&#13;
analytical and strategic depth for the work of the wider assistance community.'&#13;
B. The Transitional Support Strategy&#13;
24.   IDA's Transitional Support Strategy, which was presented to the Board on April 4, 2002 with the&#13;
Public Administration Emergency Project, is predicated on the need for well-coordinated efforts by&#13;
Afghanistan's development partners to realize Afghanistan's reconstruction and development priorities.&#13;
The key objectives of IDA's assistance over the next six to nine months are to assist the authorities in&#13;
See Afghanistan: World Bank Approach Paper, November 2001 for more details.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
establishing capacity in areas essential to facilitate the reconstruction program; to support high-priority&#13;
reconstruction activities that can also help jump-start economic activity; and to continue to build IDA's&#13;
knowledge base to allow for setting a well-designed program of future assistance. To deliver assistance&#13;
outside of Kabul, it will be vital to utilize the experiences and networks of NGOs and UN agencies, and to&#13;
develop mechanisms to channel funds directly to community groups or traditional governance structures.&#13;
25.    Assistance to Afghanistan, for both recurrent and capital expenditures, is likely to be received&#13;
from various donors and delivered through a variety of mechanisms. Hence, aid coordination will be&#13;
essential to ensure a comprehensive and unified budget that is in line with agreed national priorities. One&#13;
mechanism to assist in such coordinated funding is the multi-donor, IDA-administered Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund that will provide financing for priority expenditures including recurrent costs.&#13;
Donor funding for recurrent expenditures, including wage payments, is an essential element of the support&#13;
needed since the scope for own-revenue collection is at present very limited.&#13;
C. Rationale for Early Grant Assistance&#13;
26.    Legal Basis for Assistance to Non-Accrual Member. Under IDA's Twelfth Replenishment&#13;
Resolution, IDA 12 donor funds may be used for post-conflict grants under the following conditions: (i)&#13;
the proposed grant has been designed in accordance with OP 2.30; (ii) early performance is promising as&#13;
evidenced by the recipient country having taken convincing steps towards social and economic recovery;&#13;
(iii) arrears to IBRD and/or IDA are large and protracted, and cannot be easily or quickly cleared using&#13;
domestic resources; (iv) a concerted intemational effort to provide positive financial flows and other&#13;
assistance is underway, and other creditors have agreed not to make net withdrawals of financial&#13;
resources from the country; and (v) altemative sources of financing for post-conflict recovery are&#13;
inadequate or available only on inappropriate terms.&#13;
27.    With respect to the first two criteria, the proposed Grant has been designed in accordance with&#13;
OP 2.30, and Afghanistan is in the midst of establishing its path towards social and economic recovery.&#13;
As for Afghanistan's arrears to IDA, it has been in non-accrual status since June 1992, with outstanding&#13;
principal of US$74.7 million and overdue principal and charges of US$25.2 million. In terms of criterion&#13;
(iii), these amounts are "large and protracted" compared with Afghanistan's capability to service debt,&#13;
and Afghanistan does not have domestic resources available to clear them. As for the last two criteria, the&#13;
proposed grant would be part of the first steps in fulfilling the pledge by the World Bank Group&#13;
institutions to contribute to the international effort to assist Afghanistan; other multilateral creditors have&#13;
agreed not to make net withdrawals of financial resources prior to arrears clearance; bilateral creditors are&#13;
not expected to make net withdrawals; and alternative sources of funding are not adequate to meet&#13;
Afghanistan's needs in the immediate post-conflict period. Thus the proposed grant is consistent with the&#13;
adopted framework for IDA's provision of post-conflict grant assistance.&#13;
28.    Program of IDA Grants for early support to post-conflict recovery. The proposed grant is&#13;
part of a program of early IDA support to Afghanistan's post-conflict recovery. The program includes the&#13;
Emergency Public Administration Project (US$10M) which was approved by IDA on April 4, 2002, the&#13;
proposed Emergency Education Rehabilitation and Development Project (US$15M), the proposed&#13;
Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (US$33M), and the proposed Emergency Community&#13;
Empowerment and Public Works Project (US$42M).   This program consists of priority activities&#13;
expected to be implemented rapidly, primarily during the next 12 months. Rather than bundling the&#13;
package of emergency, quick support into one operation, as has been done in some other post-conflict&#13;
situations, the program consists of several operations organized along logical groupings in order to&#13;
enhance the focus, efficiency of management, sustained sectoral focus during supervision, and orderly&#13;
transition to normal IDA support as lessons are leamed from the various projects.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D. Rationale for Selection of Reconstruction Projects&#13;
29.    To respond to the combination of short and medium/long term needs and to maximize the use of&#13;
available resources, IDA interventions in the infrastructure sectors have been designed programmatically&#13;
in three broad phases:&#13;
* Under a Post Conflict Fund, IDA is providing support to the ALA to: (i) carry out engineering&#13;
design and production of bidding documents for the highway from Kabul to the northern region;&#13;
(ii) draft licenses for the telecom sector; (iii) complete the needs assessment for broadcasting; (iv)&#13;
contract urgent solid waste collection services; (v) procure equipment for urgent water supply&#13;
repairs in Kabul and prepare bidding documents for further urgent water supply works; and (vi)&#13;
procure urgent equipment and engineering support for the electricity sector. Some of these&#13;
activities are also contributing to the preparation of the proposed Project.&#13;
* Under the proposed Project, IDA will support (i) municipal public works (5 cities); (ii) urban&#13;
water supply (up to 12 secondary cities); (iii) sanitation (Kabul); (iv) procurement of essential&#13;
electricity transmission and distribution materials (Kabul and secondary cities); (v) procurement&#13;
of essential tools and equipment for the electricity sector; (vi) repairs to key hydropower stations&#13;
(serving Kabul); (vii) recommissioning of the gas turbine in Kabul; (viii) engineering and&#13;
management support; and (ix) technical assistance including policy and regulatory advice,&#13;
training and additional engineering support.&#13;
* Under follow-up projects, IDA will provide longer term support to investment in a restructured&#13;
institutional setting.&#13;
30.   It is recognized that rehabilitation of key parts of the road network is vital for the relief and&#13;
reconstruction efforts. Given the terrain of the country and the need for recommencement of normal&#13;
commercial activity, the resumption of internal and international commercial flights are also critical. The&#13;
current Project, however, includes only those investments where disbursements can commence in July&#13;
2002, and be completed within 12 to 18 months. As the time required for preparation and procurement of&#13;
civil works and equipment for transport precludes such rapid disbursement, IDA and the ALA are&#13;
currently discussing a stand alone transport project, the preparation of which is being funded under the&#13;
Post Conflict Fund.&#13;
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
31.    The objective of the proposed Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project is to improve&#13;
selected infrastructure service delivery in order to enhance the quality of life, health status, and welfare of&#13;
the population and to support the economic recovery of the country. This will be achieved by: (i)&#13;
carrying out urgent reconstruction and rehabilitation works to restore critical urban services and power;&#13;
(ii) providing employment opportunities through labor-based reconstruction activities; and (iii) providing&#13;
urgently needed policy advice and capacity building to the AIA in selected sectors to promote sustainable&#13;
infrastructure service delivery which fosters community and private sector participation. The outcomes of&#13;
the Project are expected to be improvements in infrastructure facilities and delivery, while laying the&#13;
foundations for sector reforms and institution building which would lead to sustainable development of&#13;
the infrastructure and energy sector. Monitoring indicators are given in Annex VI.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
32.    In pursuit of the above project objectives, the proposed Grant will finance the most urgent&#13;
reconstruction and technical assistance requirements in the urban infrastructure and energy sub-sectors,&#13;
and will set the stage for additional future assistance from the Bank Group and other donors in support of&#13;
the AIA's national development priorities. The needs for the infrastructure reconstruction program are&#13;
large, and IDA will only be able to finance part of the requirements. Criteria used to select activities as&#13;
part of the first IDA project include: (i) quick impact and readiness for disbursement; (ii) employment&#13;
creation; and (iii) geographical balance, i.e. including provincial cities other than Kabul.&#13;
33.    The project includes three components: (i) restoration of urban services, (ii) restoration of power,&#13;
and (iii) policy advice, training and engineering support in selected sectors.&#13;
34.    Selection of Cities for Each Subcomponent. The Bank fully supports the AlA's intention to&#13;
ensure a wide distribution of reconstruction support around the country within the practical constraints of&#13;
the infrastructure sectors and proposed interventions which will be supported by other donors. Given the&#13;
concentration of 85 percent of the urban population in five cities (Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat&#13;
and Jalalabad), these cities will be the focus of the urban component. The needs assessment has identified&#13;
12 cities where rapid improvements can be made in piped water supply systems; these cities will be&#13;
targeted by the urban water supply sub component. In power, the Project will concentrate on repair and&#13;
reconstruction of generation in Kabul and on transmission and distribution in Kabul and secondary cities.&#13;
Component 1: Urban Services&#13;
(estimated cost: US$16 million)&#13;
35.    Part A: Municipal Public Works Program  (US$3M equivalent). The program would support&#13;
labor-intensive public works at the municipality level up to a maximum of $50,000 for each sub-project.&#13;
A total of about 100 "sub-projects" would be financed under the program over the 18 month project&#13;
period in the five participating cities. It is estimated that 18,000 person-weeks of labor would be&#13;
supported by the Project.&#13;
36.    To ensure a needs-based distribution of program funds, allocations to each of the participating&#13;
municipalities would be calculated on three criteria: (i) urban population; (ii) number of refugees and&#13;
internally displaced people; and (iii) war damage based on number of damaged houses. These allocations&#13;
would represent a ceiling amount to be disbursed for sub-projects in any one municipality.&#13;
37.    Sub-projects are currently being identified by communities through the Gozar/Mantaqa and&#13;
District Shuras as appropriate. Applications will be screened at the municipal level according to the&#13;
following criteria: (i) degree of labor intensity; (ii) economic impact; (iii) wide social or environmental&#13;
impact; and (iv) consultation with and endorsement by local civil society/ community groups. A long list&#13;
of "eligible" project types was prepared based on findings from the Needs Assessment carried out by UN&#13;
Habitat2. The existing systems whereby municipalities contract small local contractors and NGOs will be&#13;
used to carry out these types of works.&#13;
2 Examples of projects which have been proposed by Kabul Municipality include: (i) rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of parks and green areas; (ii) repairing damaged flood control walls along the Kabul River; (iii) repair&#13;
and clearing of rubble on municipal access roads; (iv) provision of public toilet facilities close to markets and public&#13;
open spaces; and (v) filling, draining and re-designation of areas occupied by handaks (surface and waste water&#13;
collection ponds).&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38.    Subprojects would aim for social inclusion of the various local ethnic/religious groups, both as&#13;
direct project beneficiaries and as employees. This would be done at the individual project level where&#13;
feasible or over the complete range of subprojects in a given city. For all sub-projects the municipalities&#13;
should ensure that a special gender-separated consultation is held to elicit the views of the female&#13;
population.&#13;
39.    MHBTP will be responsible for coordination. The project cycle of the program would be divided&#13;
into three stages: identification of municipal allocations; promotion and appraisal of subprojects; and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
40.    Part B: Urban Water Supply Improvements (US$9.8M equivalent). This subcomponent would&#13;
support repair and rehabilitation of the water supply systems (including goods, works and engineering and&#13;
consultant services) in the 12 cities outside Kabul which have a formal network installed by CAWSS.&#13;
41. In attempting to assist these 12 provincial towns, many options have been considered for designing&#13;
and constructing the works required to restore water supply systems to good working condition thereby&#13;
serving those households already connected plus significant areas that will be served by rehabilitated&#13;
standposts. Options considered included bringing in a management contractor to rehabilitate and operate&#13;
the systems, but the lack of information precluded this approach. It was therefore agreed that the works&#13;
will be implemented by small private contractors, UN agencies or NGOs, as appropriate. CAWSS will&#13;
carry out the design and prepare the technical specifications and bidding documents with the support of a&#13;
consultant who will also supervise the works and ensure that operational training and support are&#13;
provided to provincial CAWSS staff. Based on the operational experience gained during this phase,&#13;
CAWSS assisted by the consultant, will prepare technical designs and assemble data on demand and&#13;
willingness to pay which will subsequently be used by the AIA to prepare a more progressive intervention&#13;
(possibly a management contract or contracts) at a later stage.&#13;
42.    Urgent works will be selected for execution by CAWSS based on the following criteria: (i)&#13;
numbers of families gaining access; (ii) impact on long-term operational capability of the system; (iii)&#13;
availability of funds from other sources; and (iv) equitable distribution of investments between the cities.&#13;
43.    Designs, technical specifications and bidding documents for a first batch of emergency works in&#13;
key cities will be prepared with support from a consultant funded from the PCF to enable implementation&#13;
of works to commence in July.&#13;
44.    Part C: Sanitation Improvements (US$1.5M equivalent). This subcomponent would support&#13;
repair and rehabilitation of critical sanitation facilities, including excreta disposal, solid waste&#13;
management and drainage; implementation of pilot sanitation interventions in a low-income areas of&#13;
Kabul; and ongoing support to Kabul Municipality to finance contracted services such as solid waste&#13;
collection.&#13;
45.    A consultant will carry out a rapid assessment of critical investment needs in Kabul, including the&#13;
assessment of existing requests for support from the community level, prepare bidding documents and&#13;
supervise the works for rehabilitation, the pilot project, and for ongoing contracted services. These&#13;
consultant services will initially be procured using the PCF. Modalities for health and hygiene education&#13;
will also be identified and contracts with local organizations or NGOs prepared. The existing system of&#13;
contracting with small scale contractors, local NGOs and UN agencies currently employed by Kabul&#13;
Municipality will be used. Implementation of urgent works will commence in July or August.&#13;
46.    Part D: Engineering and Management Support (US$1.7M equivalent). This subcomponent&#13;
would include: (i) engineering and management support to MHBTP to implement the municipal public&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
works program including support to the screening and processing of municipal public works projects, and&#13;
development of community planning and consultation processes in the five cities; (ii) engineering support&#13;
for the operation of water supply systems in 12 secondary cities over a period of 18 months, preparation&#13;
of designs, technical specifications and bidding documents, supervision of works, and future system&#13;
planning for each system; and (iii) engineering support to Kabul Municipality to identify, design and&#13;
supervise priority sanitation interventions.&#13;
Component 2: Power&#13;
(Estimated cost: US$15 milion)&#13;
47.   Part A: Transmission and Distribution Materials (US$6.5M equivalent). This subcomponent&#13;
consists of the procurement of transmission and distribution materials, including insulators, line supports&#13;
(including, as an interim measure until a pole factory is established, the import of steel poles), conductor,&#13;
conductor joints, cables, cable joints and boxes, transformers, switchgear and ring main units. This&#13;
equipment will be used to repair networks in some secondary cities, including augmenting the materials,&#13;
which are in stock for Herat; make urgently needed repairs in Kabul, and replace stolen insulators and&#13;
conductors on various transmission lines, including those between Shirkhon Bander and Kunduz, and&#13;
Hairatan and Pulikhumri.&#13;
48.   Part B: Essential Tools and Equipment (US$1.5M equivalent). To enable the enterprises to&#13;
begin the work of rehabilitation and repair, and facilitate a resumption of routine preventative&#13;
maintenance, this component consists of the procurement of essential stock of tools (including conductor&#13;
stringing and joining equipment), cable jointing tools, transformer repair and maintenance equipment and&#13;
related supplies, survey equipment, metering and fault test equipment, vehicles, portable diesel generating&#13;
units, communications equipment (including cell phones), computers, printers, copiers, and essential&#13;
office equipment and software.&#13;
49.   Part C: Hydropower Station Repairs (US$2.5M equivalent). This subcomponent will correct the&#13;
poor state of repair of several hydropower stations (including Naghlu, Daruanta and Pulikumri II).&#13;
Replacement spare parts will be procured from the original manufacturers of the plant and equipment, and&#13;
under the supervision of the manufacturers' engineers, DABM staff will install them.&#13;
50.   Part D: Re-commissioning of Gas Turbine and Supply of Fuel (US$3.7M equivalent). This&#13;
subcomponent includes the re-commissioning, by the original plant supplier, of the 45 MW Kabul (North&#13;
West) gas turbine plant. The component will include the supply of diesel fuel and additives to enable the&#13;
plant to operate in the event of hydro plant outages, and during winter evenings in 2002 and 2003.&#13;
51.   Part E: Engineering and Management Support (US$0.8M equivalent). This subcomponent will&#13;
support (i) supervision of the erection of the equipment and plant described in Parts A through D of the&#13;
project, to ensure that the work carried out is to an appropriate standard, training and ensuring that&#13;
environmental impacts, if any, are positive; and (ii) engineering support for the preparation of the follow&#13;
up projects as well as introduction of modern design and construction techniques.&#13;
Component 3: Policy Advice and Other Support&#13;
(estimated cost: US$2 milion)&#13;
52.   This component will include urgently required policy and regulatory advice, training and&#13;
additional engineering support to key infrastructure services including, inter alia, water supply and&#13;
sanitation, urban services, power, telecom, transport, mining, oil and gas. While a broad policy vision has&#13;
been articulated by the AIA for most infrastructure sectors, this component will provide AIA with the&#13;
necessary support to detail and start to operationalize the specific reform agenda and improve efficiency&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
by optimizing private sector and community participation. The component will help AIA to put in place&#13;
the necessary framework and the legislation to promote private sector participation in the mining and&#13;
hydrocarbon sectors. In the urban, water supply and sanitation sectors, the objective is to reinforce the&#13;
current level of private sector and community involvement and facilitate a move to more formal private&#13;
sector participation. For the power sector, the objective is to support AIA's current efforts to divest the&#13;
construction units and design an appropriate industry structure. Draft terms of reference are being&#13;
discussed and will be defined by AIA not later than July 1, 2002. Additional details on background,&#13;
sector strategy, and policy advice are provided in Annex I.&#13;

IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Detailed Implementation Arrangements by Component&#13;
Urban Component.&#13;
53.   Part A: Municipal Public Works. By July, the Ministry of Housing, Building and Town Planning&#13;
(MHBTP) will have determined the allocation of resources between the five municipalities based on the&#13;
agreed criteria and issued information to the municipalities on the mechanisms and rules for accessing&#13;
funds. MHBTP will also have convened a meeting of the mayors, key municipal staff and community&#13;
leaders to enable a consultation on the rules and modalities of the program. At the municipal level during&#13;
May and June, communities will be generating proposals (using the existing system of the district shura&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
or other appropriate mechanism) which will be prioritized at the municipal level. Proposals would then&#13;
be forwarded by municipalities to MHBTP for their no objection. Implementation will commence in&#13;
July. The materials and labor required to implement sub-projects of Part A would be procured by each&#13;
municipality on a case by case basis. At the close of the project, MHBTP would carry out an ex-post&#13;
evaluation to ascertain the extent to which the objectives and targeting aims of the subcomponent have&#13;
been met.&#13;
54.    Part B: Urban Water Supply Improvements. PCF funds will be used to procure the services of a&#13;
consulting firm with expertise in the water and sanitation sector. CAWSS, with support from this&#13;
consultant, will prepare technical designs, specifications and bidding documents for the most urgent&#13;
works to commence in July. Works will include re-establishment of supply, repair of transmission and&#13;
distribution networks, and repair and provision of new standposts to reach the maximum number of&#13;
consumers. The materials and labor required to implement the works will be procured by MPW. For the&#13;
remaining works, the consultant will present outline proposals to CAWSS who will prioritize&#13;
interventions across the cities according to the agreed criteria. The consultants will then package the&#13;
works appropriately and prepare bidding documents. Each package will include a health education&#13;
component to be contracted to local NGOs. The consultant will supervise the works and certify the&#13;
payments. The consultant will also assist CAWSS in the operation of the systems and produce an&#13;
analysis of long term investment and management needs for each city which will form part of the&#13;
preparation material for any future investments.&#13;
55.    Part C: Sanitation Improvements. Kabul Municipality already has a list of priority actions&#13;
identified by District Shuras which will form the basis of this subcomponent. Using PCF funds Kabul&#13;
Municipality will procure the services of a consulting firm or individual to review the sanitation situation&#13;
and assist in the final selection of urgent works and/or key pilot interventions in consultation with&#13;
community groups and the agencies currently working in the city. Selection of urgent works will be done&#13;
in the light of longer term strategic investment needs. The consultant will package the works, prepare&#13;
bidding documents or other documentation (if, for example, works are to be community executed). The&#13;
materials and labor required to implement the works will be procured by Kabul Municipality. Given the&#13;
simple nature of many of the works and the existing database covering the sanitation situation in Kabul,&#13;
implementation will commence in July or August.&#13;
56.    Part D: Engineering and Management Support. This technical assistance will be provided by&#13;
consultants selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Power Component.&#13;
57.    Part A: Transmission and Distribution: The staff of the Power Construction Unit (PCU) will&#13;
install in several teams, the replacement insulators and conductors on 110 kV and 220 kV transmission&#13;
lines. Rates for installation will be prepared by PCU and reviewed and, if necessary, corrected by the&#13;
Planning Department of the MOP, which will effect a contract with the PCU to carry out the installation&#13;
works. However such contract will exclude the cost of PCU staff. The installation of materials and&#13;
replacement parts on the distribution systems will be carried out by the DABM as part of its resumed&#13;
maintenance routine. Part of the work under this subcomponent is required to be implemented through&#13;
departmental labor/force account in view of scattered work in remote locations/emergency nature of the&#13;
work.&#13;
58.    Part B: Essential Tools and Equipment: The essential stocks of tools and vehicles, etc. will be put&#13;
to use by the various power sector enterprises.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59.    Part C: Strategic Spare Parts for Hydropower stations: DABM will install the strategic spares&#13;
for the hydro plants as part of its resumed maintenance routine, but under the supervision of the supplier&#13;
of the spares for each hydro station.&#13;
60.    Part D: Re-commissioning of NW Kabul Gas Turbine Plant: The PCU will carry out the&#13;
completion of the gas turbine unit under the supervision of the supply contractor, via a contract to be&#13;
issued to the PCU by the Planning Department of PWP. (The PCU erected the gas turbine units in 1986&#13;
under the supervision of the supplier.)&#13;
61.    Parts E: Engineering and Policy Strategy Assistance: This technical assistance will be provided&#13;
by consultants selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Policy Advice and Other Support Component.&#13;
62.    Policy advice and other technical assistance will be provided by consultants selected in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines. The following ministries will be the key counterparts for policy advice&#13;
and technical assistance: (i) Ministry of Public Works for water supply and transport; (ii) Ministry of&#13;
Water and Power for power; (iii) Ministry of Mines and Industry for mining and oil and gas; (iv) Ministry&#13;
of Telecommunications for telecommunications; and (v) possibly other ministries. The Afghanistan&#13;
Assistance Coordination Agency (AACA) will assist with coordination.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
63.    Major procurement, overall financial management and audit functions for the proposed Project&#13;
will be undertaken by three Agents - Procurement, Financial Management and Audit - funded under the&#13;
recently approved IDA grant-financed Emergency Public Administration Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
The three Agents are responsible for carrying out these core functions on behalf of the ALA and in&#13;
cooperation with the line ministries. This arrangement of having specialized firms in place early on&#13;
(contracts are expected to be signed by end May 2002) would ensure compliance with IDA procedures&#13;
from the outset, and expedite implementation of project activities.&#13;
64.    Goods, works and consulting services financed under the Project shall be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants,&#13;
and using the Bank's model standard bidding documents. Each contract for goods or works estimated to&#13;
be equivalent of US$300,000 or more and the first three contracts for goods and the first three contracts&#13;
for works, irrespective of value, shall be subject to prior review by IDA. Each contract for employment&#13;
of consulting firms estimated to cost US$100,000 or more, and US$50,000 or more in case of individual&#13;
consultants, shall be subject to prior review by IDA. All other contracts will be subject to the post award&#13;
review. For some of the urgent repair/replacement/recommissioning work, direct contracting with the&#13;
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is envisaged. For some of the major consulting services, the&#13;
preferred selection method is Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS); however, to facilitate quicker&#13;
selection of firms for this emergency project, selection based on Consultants' Qualification (CQ) is being&#13;
adopted. Detailed procurement arrangement is provided in Annex III.&#13;
C. Disbursement and Financial Management&#13;
65.    Since there is no Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country Financial&#13;
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate knowledge of country issues and&#13;
related strengths and weaknesses. Financial management capacity in the country is not fully functional&#13;
and appropriate mitigation measures have been suggested through the engagement of the Financial&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Management Agent. The Financial Management Agent will be responsible for assisting the MOF to&#13;
maintain the accounts for all Government expenditures, including IDA financed projects, including the&#13;
proposed project, in addition to building capacity within AIA for these functions.&#13;
66.    Funds Flow: Funds flow under the project will use the existing government system as much as&#13;
possible. As is the practice for government expenditure, all project payments will be routed through the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Financial Management Agent to be appointed will support the MOF in&#13;
executing and recording project payments.&#13;
67.    Treasury officials at the MOF will be the authorized persons to operate the USD Special Account&#13;
of the project at Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB); IDA funds will be deposited into the Special Account.&#13;
When a project payment is required to be made, implementing agencies (line ministries and other&#13;
government departments) will submit a standard payment request to the MOF-Treasury. Treasury&#13;
officials, after verifying the documents and checking the availability of funds in the Special Account and&#13;
budget will, (a) for payments in Afghanis issue a check in Afghanis for encashment at DAB and (b) in&#13;
case of a payment in foreign currency instruct DAB to execute the payment.&#13;
68.    For the municipal works component of the project, MOF will, on the advice of Ministry of&#13;
Housing, Building and Town planning (MHBTP) transfer advance funds out of the special account to the&#13;
municipalities to enable them to make payments to communities, small contractors or NGOs promptly.&#13;
69.    All withdrawal applications to the IDA, including replenishment, reimbursement and direct&#13;
payment applications, will be prepared and submitted by the MOF.&#13;
70.    Due to reasons related to security, damaged infrastructure, and a breakdown in communication&#13;
between the branches and the Kabul office of Da Afghanistan Bank (the Central Bank), the AIA will face&#13;
a challenge in effecting payments throughout the country. Although not all the branches of Da&#13;
Afghanistan Bank are currently fully functional, efforts are being made to rehabilitate the branches so that&#13;
the payment needs of the AIA throughout the country can be met, including making arrangements for&#13;
secure transport of cash notes around the country. In addition, in the short term there could be a shortage&#13;
of Afghani currency notes within the formal system. Salary payments have recently been made in 25 of&#13;
the 32 provinces, and the payment systems are being restarted throughout the country. Although the AIA&#13;
and Da Afghanistan Bank prefer to use the normal payment systems, in the case that Da Afghanistan&#13;
Bank cannot provide the payment services in all required locations, the AIA could resort to alternative&#13;
systems (e.g., Hawala) to effect payments in these locations. If the AIA chooses to use such an&#13;
alternative system for the flow of funds on IDA-financed activities, the implementation mechanisms and&#13;
risk mitigation measures will be agreed with IDA prior to the flow of funds through the alternative&#13;
system.&#13;
71.   Audit Arrangements: The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General with the&#13;
support of the Audit Agent with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project&#13;
financial statement to the Association would include a summary of funds received (showing funds&#13;
received from all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/&#13;
activities and by main categories of expenditures.&#13;
72.    Retroactive Financing: Provision has been made to reimburse AIA for payments it makes, up to&#13;
SDR 3.5 million, between April 1, 2002 and Grant signing for Project expenditures.&#13;
73.    Disbursement Method:  Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with full&#13;
documentation or against statements of expenditures as appropriate).&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74.    Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs): Disbursements will be made on the basis of SOEs&#13;
for: (a) consultants and training for contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals; and (b) works and goods for contracts not exceeding US$300,000.&#13;
D. Environment and Social Safeguard&#13;
75.   The principles governing social and environmental management will be applied through an&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the Framework) which is attached in Annex V. The&#13;
Framework is applicable to all activities financed by the proposed Project, and includes (i) key policy&#13;
principles for social and environmental management, (ii) tools to guide the screening of subprojects for&#13;
significant social and environmental impacts, and to assist in the mitigation of such impacts, (iii)&#13;
procedures to ensure that these principles and tools are appropriately applied, and (iv) guidelines for&#13;
capacity building and monitoring. The Framework will be operationalized through the proposed Project's&#13;
arrangements for implementation, capacity building and monitoring.&#13;
76.   The reconstruction and rehabilitation interventions envisaged under the proposed project are not&#13;
expected to generate significant negative environmental effects. Rather, they should contribute to the&#13;
improvement of environmental conditions. Limited adverse impacts could result, however, from&#13;
inadequate design and construction practices. To limit the extent of these risks, the Framework provides&#13;
a negative list of activities ineligible for support under the proposed project. To mitigate the remaining&#13;
potential impacts, the guidelines and codes of practice included in the Framework provide social and&#13;
environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated in the design, contracting and monitoring of sub-&#13;
projects. The only intervention expected to require a separate environmental report is the rehabilitation of&#13;
the NW Kabul power plant, for which an environmental audit will be conducted as part of&#13;
recommissioning.&#13;
77.   No activities will be supported that require involuntary land acquisition or the acquisition of land&#13;
requiring the resettlement or compensation of more than 200 people. Consequently, no Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan will be required for the proposed project. The voluntary donation or compensated&#13;
contribution of land for subproject activities will be guided by the "Guidelines for Land and Asset&#13;
Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation" included in the Framework.&#13;
78.   Given the nature of the operation (being processed under OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery&#13;
Assistance) and the proposed activities for IDA financing, an exemption has been obtained from the&#13;
requirement to make the Framework publicly available prior to appraisal. The Framework will, however,&#13;
be made publicly available in Afghanistan and at the World Bank Info Shop prior to presentation of the&#13;
proposed project to the World Bank Board.&#13;
79.   Gender. The last twenty years of social upheaval has greatly affected the overall gender situation&#13;
in Afghanistan, resulting in very restrictive policies vis-a-vis women's participation in public life, access&#13;
to education and other services as well as employment opportunities. This development culminated&#13;
during the Taliban regime where women and girls were effectively excluded from any participation in&#13;
public life. With the replacement of the Taliban regime, women have regained the right to education,&#13;
employment opportunities and services, but the prevailing social norms are still very conservative and&#13;
restrictive regarding women's participation in the national development effort.  There are huge&#13;
differences between Kabul and the much smaller secondary cities, and the rural areas. In addition, there&#13;
are considerable regional differences with the south and southeastern areas of the country being more&#13;
restrictive and conservative than the western and northern areas. These variations to some extent coincide&#13;
with ethnic differences. To this should be added the great difference in outlook of returning refugees&#13;
(whether repatriating from the West or from the neighboring countries) and those who remained in&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80.   The components of the project will benefit households in general by providing increased level of&#13;
services including power, water, sanitation and transport. While women and children are not specifically&#13;
targeted, they will be the primary beneficiaries of the interventions in water and sanitation in terms of&#13;
health gains (the under-S mortality rate is currently 25%) and reduced workload in water collection. The&#13;
realization of these benefits will be ensured through the provision of health education as part of the water&#13;
and sanitation interventions.&#13;
81.   The types of public works planned under the project are not expected to generate labor&#13;
opportunities for women to any significant degree, with the exception of the health education component&#13;
to be managed by the municipalities, which will primarily be employing women. During the process of&#13;
consultations with local communities, separate arrangements shall be made to ensure participation by and&#13;
consultation with women, as they can not be expected to be covered through the general community&#13;
consultations.&#13;
E. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
82.   Monitoring arrangements include plans for intensive supervision by IDA to ensure that any&#13;
implementation difficulties are dealt with promptly. At a minimum, a full supervision mission is needed&#13;
quarterly, with specialists visiting Afghanistan more frequently if needed during Project implementation.&#13;
A quarterly progress report will be prepared and submitted to IDA, which consolidates all components&#13;
including progress towards meeting implementation and development objectives, as further detailed in the&#13;
Project's procurement plan and detailed monitoring indicators. Responsibility for this reporting rests with&#13;
the AACA, with each implementing agency agreeing to provide requisite input. Annex VI provides&#13;
additional details on monitoring indicators for the Project.&#13;
F. Justification&#13;
83.   This project is expected to be the start of a longer term involvement of IDA and other Bank&#13;
Group instruments in selected infrastructure sub sectors. This first operation will, apart from emergency&#13;
assistance, set the stage for: (i) increasing access to sustainable urban infrastructure services and power;&#13;
and (ii) developing the vast potential of energy and mineral resources for the benefit of the Afghan&#13;
population at large. In addition to the creation of suitable legal and regulatory frameworks, capacity&#13;
building efforts supported by the Project would help to create absorptive capacity for handling donor&#13;
assistance, community driven development as well as other forms of private sector involvement across&#13;
infrastructure sectors.&#13;

ANNEXES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I: DETAILED INFORMATION ON RELEVANT INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS&#13;
A. Urban Services&#13;
1.     Sector Organization. Under the 1964 Constitution, all local authorities fall under the Ministry&#13;
of Interior, except for Kabul which is headed by an appointed mayor with ministerial rank. There are 32&#13;
provinces in the country, each administered by a Provincial Governor, to whom all mayors report. Each&#13;
Province has a capital town varying in size from 5,000 people to Kabul's population of 2.5 million.&#13;
There are 217 municipalities with a population of 5,000 or more, but more than 85 percent of the urban&#13;
population are concentrated in the five largest towns.&#13;
2.     The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is responsible for municipal governance and oversight while&#13;
the Ministry of Housing, Building and Town Planning (MHIBTP), formerly the Ministry of Urban&#13;
Development, historically was responsible for the preparation of master plans, housing plans and&#13;
oversight of construction norms and standards. Several years ago, MHIBTP was subsumed under the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works but was recently re-established although it lacks staff and assets.&#13;
3.     Notwithstanding Kabul's special status, its functions are typical of an urban local authority. Prior&#13;
to 1992, the responsibilities of Kabul Municipality were the implementation of the city's master plan,3&#13;
construction of canals, ditches, flood protection measures, solid waste management, supervision of public&#13;
parks, greening the city, construction and paving of roads, control of food prices, distribution of land plots&#13;
for commercial and residential purposes, recovery of residential sites, cultural services and expansion of&#13;
food markets. In cooperation with other ministries, it was also indirectly involved in the construction of&#13;
the city sewerage system, water supply, construction of prefabricated apartments, city power,&#13;
communications, public health, education, and sport. Public urban transport is controlled by the Ministry&#13;
of Transport while traffic management falls under the MOI.&#13;
4.     Staff of municipalities are centrally appointed: top-level managers require the Prime Minister's&#13;
approval; middle managers require the Minister's approval; and all other employees require the approval&#13;
of the Provincial Governor. Since 1992, there have been no elections to city councils, with all officials&#13;
being appointed by the administration of the day.&#13;
5.     While sources of municipal revenue are varied, revenue collection has been at a low level owing&#13;
to the disturbances and a lack of service provision. Significant sources of revenue raised at the local level&#13;
(customs, business tax, levies, income tax) flow to the central government with little redirected back to&#13;
the local level. While there are claims that local governments are autonomous, their lack of local revenue&#13;
and their relatively limited sphere of action, highly circumscribed in the development arena, would&#13;
indicate that they are not.&#13;
6.     Within municipalities each district has a president and vice president, below whom are five&#13;
offices: engineering, foodstuffs control, statistics, administration, and income. Residential areas are&#13;
currently organized administratively by the municipality in all cities into gozars (neighborhoods), with&#13;
distinct physical boundaries, each with a wakil-e-gozar (neighborhood level representative). Typically,&#13;
about 15-20 gozars form a single district. Prior to the Mujahideen takeover, elections were held for&#13;
community representatives at district level, via mosques and collection centers. In connection with the&#13;
3 The 1978 master plan was not implemented fully, reportedly due to insufficient funds, lack of management and&#13;
planning capacity. Unplanned shelter expansion occurred, with other government agencies also contributing&#13;
through the construction of facilities without reference to the master plan.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
rehabilitation efforts district shuras have been formed, and representatives from each shura combine to&#13;
form an informal council which meets regularly at municipal level.&#13;
7.     Urban Water Supply and Sanitation. The nodal agency for delivery of urban water supply and&#13;
piped sewerage is the Central Authority for Water Supply and Sanitation (CAWSS) which falls under the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works (MPW). CAWSS was established in 1978 as a quasi autonomous, publicly-&#13;
owned company. CAWSS is responsible for the water supply system in Kabul and has established&#13;
networks in twelve provincial cities4. CAWSS serves 31,500 connections in Kabul, about 3,000&#13;
connections each in the major provincial towns (Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif), and about 1,000&#13;
connections in the smaller towns such as Ghazni. The average staffing is therefore about 10 per 1,000&#13;
connections, which is low compared to the regional average (25-30 per 1,000), but above "good practice"&#13;
levels of 4 to 5 per 1,000.&#13;
8.     Within Kabul the former Soviet-style public housing complexes and some other buildings are&#13;
maintained by an independent agency within the MPW, known as the Macro-Rayan Maintenance&#13;
Department, which maintains independent water supply and sanitation systems. Sanitation, other than&#13;
sewerage, is the responsibility of the municipalities.&#13;
9.    In most urban areas, NGOs have taken responsibility for investments and management of&#13;
significant parts of the water supply and sanitation systems. Key players include Habitat, ICRC, CARE&#13;
International and German Agro Action. The scale of NGO/ Agency involvement is significant. (ICRC,&#13;
for example, have constructed 46,000 latrines in Kabul, and solid waste management in the city is&#13;
maintained only because of significant support provided through CARE, Habitat and ICRC.) Any future&#13;
strategy will need to reflect this situation. In addition, NGOs and Agencies have worked closely with&#13;
various community fora and directly with households and are a significant resource in terms of future&#13;
engagement between water supply and sanitation service delivery agents and consumers.&#13;
10.   The linkage between CAWSS staff in the provincial towns and Kabul is limited and these staff&#13;
seem to have a stronger relationship with provincial governors or the municipalities. In recent times&#13;
communication with the Southern cities such as Kandahar, Ghazni, Jalalabad, Herat, has been maintained,&#13;
but not with the Northern Cities formerly under the Northern Alliance. Even in Kabul, CAWSS has lost&#13;
many of its physical assets (records, equipment etc) and many of the staff are requesting capacity building&#13;
to bring them up to date with new approaches in the areas of management, office technology, water&#13;
supply and sanitation technology and modern institutional approaches to the sector. Nonetheless,&#13;
CAWSS staff and staff in the Agencies and NGOs in all the cities have shown dedication and creativity in&#13;
keeping at least parts of the network operational.&#13;
11.   Sector Status. Most urban Afghans currently lack access to basic services - and must either go&#13;
without or rely on costly alternatives. Among the most serious costs, particularly for women and&#13;
children, are the costs in terms of health (from unsafe water and sanitation and household air pollution&#13;
from burning traditional biomass fuels) and time (for example, fetching water and fuel).&#13;
12.   Most of the urban water supply systems in Afghanistan's cities and towns have been severely&#13;
damaged either directly during the period of conflict, or indirectly due to the prolonged period of neglect&#13;
and lack of maintenance. As a result the systems are operating at very low levels of efficiency. Source&#13;
yields are adversely affected by deterioration in the boreholes, lack of appropriate pumps, and fluctuating&#13;
power supplies. The distribution networks have been broken and mended haphazardly using any&#13;
4Charikar, Ghazni, Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif, Mehterlam, Qala-e-Naw, Qalat,&#13;
Shiberghan and Taluqan.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
available pipe materials and informal connections are widespread. Significant parts of the systems have&#13;
been cut off from the network and there are a large number of alternative systems which have been built&#13;
around new borewells. However a significant number of consumers are still able to access some supply&#13;
through standposts which will form a major source of potable water for the foreseeable future.&#13;
13.    When and if water does reach the house, consumers have little incentive to conserve water. While&#13;
there seems to be a convention of paying for water supply, cost recovery is very low. Tariffs are&#13;
inconsistent with costs and the level of metering is very poor . In Kabul in 2001 CAWSS billed less than&#13;
US$150,000 (or less than US$5 per connection) of which only about 18 percent was collected due in part&#13;
to the confused situation with regard to tenure and the inability of government institutions to pay their&#13;
bills.&#13;
14.    As a consequence coverage is low and service unreliable. There is heavy reliance on local or on-&#13;
site water and sanitation solutions. It is estimated that less than 20 percent of Kabul's population are&#13;
currently served by piped water. Access to safe sanitation is very limited in urban areas although&#13;
impressive work has been done by NGOs and UN agencies to construct latrines utilizing composting&#13;
toilets. In many families hygiene practices are poor. Diarrheal disease is a major cause of infant and&#13;
child mortality - estimated to account for 27 percent of deaths in children between birth and one year, and&#13;
12 percent of deaths of children between the ages of one and five.&#13;
15.    Around a quarter of urban housing is seriously damaged or destroyed and about 40 percent of&#13;
housing units are in unplanned areas. Urban infrastructure is also severely damaged or destroyed: about&#13;
40 percent of roads are damaged and 50 percent of drains are broken or do not function. About 50&#13;
percent of houses have no solid waste collection and sanitary disposal sites do not exist.&#13;
16.    Afghan authorities now have to cope with rapid urban growth due to high natural population&#13;
increase, urbanization, and a current influx of returning refugees and displaced people; a backlog of land&#13;
and housing needs caused a combination of years of turmoil and a rigid master planning system; a&#13;
deteriorated housing stock, overcrowding, and pressure to make more land available for housing; a&#13;
mismatch between land and housing prices and income levels; an outdated and incomplete land&#13;
registration system; pressure to resolve disputed property claims; and a severe lack of financial resources.&#13;
17.    The key donors active in the urban services sector are:&#13;
*  Agencies and NGOs including Habitat, ICRC, CARE International, German Agro Action&#13;
and DACAAR who have provided support for both water supply and sanitation in various&#13;
cities during the past 10 years;&#13;
*  KfW supporting urban water supply in Kabul and possibly Herat;&#13;
*  EU planning to support urban development in a number of secondary cities;&#13;
*  USAID who have been providing support to agencies delivering urgent urban services&#13;
such as solid waste management;&#13;
*  ISAF providing support to urban reconstruction; and&#13;
5 In Kabul, both volumetric and flat rates are used, depending on whether the connection is equipped with a meter.&#13;
Current volumetric rates are Afg. 1000/ m3 for households ($0.03 / m3), and Afg. 4500/m3 for offices and NGOs&#13;
($0.13/m3). Few meters are likely to be operational at the current time. For those connections without a meter,&#13;
rates are Afg. 120,000/year ($3.43/year) for % inch connections, Afg. 240,000/year for /4 inch connections, and Afg.&#13;
480,000/year for 1 inch connections. Connection fees are Afg. 100,000 for % inch connections, Afg. 200,000 for 3/4&#13;
inch connections, and Afg. 400,000 for 1 inch connections. A labor charge of Afg. 80,000 has to be paid in addition&#13;
to the connection fee. Consumers have to be settle their bills at local branches of the Afghan Bank, which then&#13;
transfers the money to CAWSS own Bank account.&#13;

* Government of Japan who previously provided support to construct water supply in&#13;
Kandahar and have launched a US$3M urban reconstruction fund for Kabul jointly with&#13;
lTNDP.&#13;
18.   In view of the large number of agencies and donors already active or interested in supporting&#13;
sector investments in Kabul City, particularly in water supply, short and medium term interventions by&#13;
IDA will focus largely on the delivery of improved services in provincial and other secondary cities.&#13;
Where other donors are willing and able to quickly support investments in particular cities this will be&#13;
coordinated. Where possible, secondary cities will be dealt with in geographic clusters by donors to&#13;
facilitate interventions.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
B. Power&#13;
1.    Overview of the power sector. In 1966, the Government created a state-owned power sector,&#13;
when it bought out the private investors who jointly owned with Government the country's Electricity&#13;
Corporation. Currently, the Ministry of Power (MOP) is responsible for the power sector, under&#13;
Afghanistan's Usage of Electricity Act of 1986. The Act describes the rights of the consumer and sets&#13;
down the responsibilities of the MOP with regard to the generation and supply of electricity, and the&#13;
development of new and renewable energy sources. In the 1980s, the Government passed the Enterprises&#13;
Act, which set out the responsibilities of the various departments, or enterprises, of the various sectors&#13;
including the power sector. This Act describes the memberships of the Boards of Directors of the&#13;
enterprises, along with their responsibilities and the need to operate each entity in a cost effective and&#13;
autonomous manner.&#13;
2.     The enterprises in the power sector are: (i) Da Afghanistan Breshna Moassesa (DABM), which is&#13;
responsible for the operation and maintenance of Afghanistan's generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
assets, as well as the sales of electricity. DABM accounts for about 80% of the country's electricity&#13;
production and distribution, with the Ministries of Mines and Industry, and Light Industry accounting for&#13;
much of the remaining generation, as owners of major industrial and small-scale enterprises; (ii) the&#13;
Water and Power Engineering Consultancy Authority (WAPECA), which, under specific contracts with&#13;
the Planning Department of the MOP, designs the additions to Afghanistan's generation and transmission&#13;
capacity; (iii) the Spinghar Construction Unit, which is similarly awarded contracts by the Planning&#13;
Department to build the civil works of its substations and power stations; (iv) the Power Construction&#13;
Unit, which is contracted by the Planning Department to erect power station equipment, and transmission&#13;
and distribution lines and the associated substations; and (v) the New and Renewable Energy Research&#13;
and Development Center. However, the enterprises, which are quasi-government departments, have not&#13;
been run autonomously, because successive governments have controlled most decisions and the Ministry&#13;
of Finance has controlled, through its budget, the sector's annual recurrent costs and investments.&#13;
3.     Recognizing that this is not a desirable situation, the AIA's vision for the power sector is to&#13;
encourage community service delivery, particularly in rural areas, and encourage local and foreign private&#13;
investors to provide services at least cost in an environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable way.&#13;
Government would withdraw from implementation of investment projects and operations while keeping&#13;
responsibility for policy making and putting in place an appropriate regulatory framework. As a first step,&#13;
the AIA plans, over the next few months, to bring the semi-autonomous "enterprises" reporting to the&#13;
Ministry of Water and Power under a new framework of company law reflecting the Constitutional Law&#13;
of 1964 which would provide them with real autonomy. The AIA intends to privatize the Power&#13;
Construction and the Spinghar Construction Units as soon as possible. The options for further&#13;
restructuring and possible privatization of Da Afghanistan Breshna Moassesa (DABM - the power&#13;
utility), which is responsible for operation and maintenance of the system throughout the country, will&#13;
need some further study, but it is expected to be implemented in the near future.&#13;
4.     Generation assets. Afghanistan has never had a national grid, and several isolated electricity&#13;
networks are centered on Kabul or the other secondary cities. The countrywide total of generating&#13;
capacity supplying the networks in the early 1990s amounted to 377 MW. As a result of the above&#13;
events, this capacity has declined to a fragile 200 MW, all of which is old and near to collapse. Details of&#13;
generation capacities for Kabul and the other cities are contained in Table 1 below. Much of the&#13;
operational plant is centered on Kabul, where currently each evening half of the consumers in rotation are&#13;
fed by three hydroelectric power stations, with a total nameplate rating of 188 MW. These power stations&#13;
are currently de-rated to about 120 MW, because of their age and their un-maintained, vulnerable&#13;
condition. Currently their total output is further downgraded to a total of about 60 MW because the&#13;
Kabul river on which the hydro stations are sited, is fed mainly by melting snow; and dryer than usual&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
conditions have prevailed for the last four years, resulting in the reservoir outflow having to be carefully&#13;
rationed every day. The hydro-generation and associated substation plant and equipment are outdated and&#13;
have been poorly maintained. Much of it needs replacing. If the systems are to continue running in the&#13;
interim for the next year or two, strategic spares and consumables must be purchased and installed as soon&#13;
as possible. Because the stations are 35 and 45 years old, the spares will be difficult and expensive to&#13;
acquire.&#13;
5.     Kabul. city also has two gas turbine stations. One has been damaged by warfare, and this,&#13;
combined with its age, means that it is uneconomic to rehabilitate. The other with a capacity of 45 MW is&#13;
in mothballs, and has not been operated for 10 years. Most of the equipment to convert the station to a&#13;
more efficient combined cycle unit utilizing the turbines' waste heat, was delivered to site but it was not&#13;
installed because inter-factional fighting in 1988 and conditions since prevented the contractor from&#13;
completing the work. The station would use diesel at the rate of about $4,000 per hour, which DABM&#13;
cannot afford to procure. Thus the current evening supply of electricity to Kabul is limited to 60 MW,&#13;
which is about half the connected demand.&#13;
6.    In the secondary cities, where hydro-electric power has been the predominant source of supply,&#13;
the generation capacities of the machines are much lower than their nameplate ratings, because they are&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
7.     Transmission and distribution. In the early 1990s, Afghanistan's networks were made up of&#13;
about 3,800 km of transmission lines and about 5,450 km of distribution lines. These have been damaged&#13;
by factional fighting, and have had little or no maintenance, due to a lack of funds. Hundreds of&#13;
kilometers of conductor and the supporting towers and insulators have been stolen. The networks lengths&#13;
have been reduced to about 2,170 km and 3,700 km of transmission and distribution lines respectively.&#13;
The factories in Kabul and Kandahar, which produced pre-stressed spun concrete poles for the&#13;
transrnission, distribution and telephone networks, have been completely destroyed. Afghanistan's&#13;
substation capacities have been simnilarly depleted, from a total capacity of 507 MVA in the early 1990s,&#13;
to about 315 MVA today. Details of the town networks, the transmission lines and associated substations&#13;
are contained in Table 2. In some cities, many lower voltage cables have been dangerously repaired with&#13;
the metal of the joints in the open and above ground. Several accidental deaths have occurred in the last&#13;
year when adults or children have touched them. Table 2 also records the many transmission and sub-&#13;
transmission voltages that have been foisted upon the sector when network materials have being donated&#13;
to Afghanistan by various countries. There is an eventual need for some standardization to reduce stores,&#13;
associated tooling and costs. The missing transmission lines should be supplying important secondary&#13;
towns such as Gulbahar, Kunduz and Pulikhumri, where supplies of electrical power are needed by&#13;
existing, operational publicly-owned textile and soap factories, cement mills, coal mines and other&#13;
commercial undertakings, where work can be provided to returning immigrants, and production can begin&#13;
to support the rebuilding of the devastation.&#13;

8.    Imports.   Afghanistan imports electrical power from four sources. (i) It began to import&#13;
electricity from Uzbekistan in 1985. Imports ceased during the Taliban rule, but were resumed in March&#13;
2002. Uzbekistan is supplying up to 22 MW to the city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Jawzjan province, via a&#13;
220 kV transmission line currently operating at 110 kV. No purchase agreement has been effected yet.&#13;
(ii) Afghanistan has been importing power from Turkmenistan since 1993, supplying Andkhoi district&#13;
near the border with about 5 million kWh per year via a 110 kV line; and supplying Turghundi district in&#13;
Herat province with about 8 million kWh via a 10 kV line. The tariff is US cents 5 per kWh. The 110 kV&#13;
line from Andkhoi and Jergodog was commissioned on April 15, 2002, and supplies from Turkmenistan&#13;
are now available to Balkh and Jawzjan province. MOP has plans to build a 220 kV line to Herat city ,&#13;
6Herat city provides an interesting case of private sector participation in the power sector. The city's publicly&#13;
owned generators have long since been destroyed, and its 6.0 kV system has been abandoned as a result. However,&#13;
the city has about 80 privately owned, 50-125 kW, diesel generators, which feed into small area low voltage&#13;
networks. Consumers, who must provide their own connections and meters, pay the city's MOP Directorate, who in&#13;
turn reimburses the owners of the generators according to their supplies. Based on the monthly cost of diesel fuel, a&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
where power imports from Turkmenistan can be distributed. The city has had distribution materials in&#13;
stock since 1975, which were provided by East Germany to upgrade the now defunct 6.0 kV system to 20&#13;
kV. They were never installed. (iii) Tajikistan is supplying power to villages near the border in the&#13;
province of Badakhshan, through 6 and 10 kV sub-transmission lines. If the insulators and aluminum&#13;
conductor are restored to the 110 kV line from Sherkhan Bandar to Kunduz, Tajikistan power can be&#13;
supplied to Kunduz and the surrounds. No power purchase agreement has yet been effected. (iv) Iran&#13;
supplies about 500 kW to Zaranj town in Nimroz province. No power purchase agreement has been&#13;
effected Iran yet.&#13;
9.     Consumers. Currently there are about 90,000 electricity consumers in Afghanistan. But in 1990&#13;
in Kabul alone there were about 150,000 consumers. Their combined maximum, though unsatisfied,&#13;
demand in the winter months was about 300 MW. Currently Kabul has only 56,000 domestic consumers,&#13;
about 1,920 commercial and 2,250 industrial consumers. Government offices and undertakings, grouped&#13;
under the commercial tariff classification, number about 500 connections. Of the 56,000 domestic&#13;
consumers, about 60 percent are government employees. Kabul's current annual maximum demand,&#13;
which is also unmet, is about 130 MW on winter evenings. It consists largely of a domestic heating load.&#13;
Because of limited generation and transmission capacities, only about half of the consumers are provided&#13;
with electricity on alternative evenings. In the secondary cities, conditions are much worse, and supplies&#13;
are usually only provided for a couple of hours each evening at best. Everywhere security is threatened&#13;
by the lack of street lighting. Afghanistan's installed working capacity for electricity generation at 0.11&#13;
kW per capita, and the utilization of electricity of 16 kWh per year per capita is probably the lowest in the&#13;
world. Only about 4 percent of the population has access to power supplies.&#13;
10.    System losses. Total losses in the Afghanistan power systems are difficult to estimate accurately.&#13;
However, technical losses, caused by poorly repaired transmission and distribution lines, which have&#13;
inadequate capacities, are estimated to be about 35 percent. Non-technical losses (theft) are estimated to&#13;
be about 15 percent. Each consumer is individually metered, and DABM operates a strict disconnection&#13;
policy for defaulting payers. However, the billing system currently used is entirely manual, no use of&#13;
computerization is involved, thus the process is slow, and data and records are difficult to access.&#13;
11.    The status of the sector enterprises. DABM's service area is geographically large (the country&#13;
has an area of 652,000 km2), much of it with a very low population density. Historic data related to the&#13;
sector is sparse, and most of the records have been destroyed; often burnt as fuel in the winter when the&#13;
offices of the power sector were billeted by factional forces. Currently throughout the country, the power&#13;
sector infrastructure is in disarray, caused by a combination of the direct effects of the wars that have&#13;
blighted Afghanistan for the last twenty-five years, and by subsequent pillages of much of the sector&#13;
equipment. The consequent damage has been compounded by a lack of spare parts and a lack of&#13;
appropriate maintenance, caused by an under-funding of the sector by succeeding governments, despite&#13;
DABM's financial viability over the years. The substantial loss in value of the Afghani has contributed to&#13;
the problem. The tariff was recently reduced' in Kabul, which DABM estimates will decrease its&#13;
delegation of the owners sets the domestic, shopkeepers' and comnmercial tariffs, in which the Directorate allows a&#13;
reasonable profit.&#13;

collections by two-thirds to about 5 billion Afs/month. As a result of these difficult conditions, the&#13;
otherwise diligent electricity staff, which has made heroic efforts to keep the aged system operating, has&#13;
been unable to properly maintain and repair much of the remaining equipment. All five power sector&#13;
enterprises have suffered badly from the conditions of the last 25 years. Buildings have been partially or&#13;
totally destroyed, and looted of tools, plant and equipment. The enterprises are operating with a few ex-&#13;
USSR trucks, all of which are about thirty years old. Spares are not available for them. The power sector&#13;
has virtually no office furniture, no stationary or consumables, no light bulbs or cleaning materials, and&#13;
no telephones or radio communications. The power sector shares one, recently donated, desk-top&#13;
computer and a printer.&#13;
12.   The five enterprises have a total of about 6,044 staff positions, and the MOP has 537 staff&#13;
positions. Twenty or so years ago, most of these posts were filled. In response to AIA's invitation to&#13;
return to work, about 2,000 staff have recently reported back for duty, to join the 3,500 who remained in&#13;
their posts. However, many of the sector's staff are close to retirement, and because of the conditions that&#13;
have prevailed for the last twenty-five years, most of the staff have been unable to remain current with&#13;
modem worldwide developments in the power sector.&#13;
13.   IDA support to the sector. The proposed Project complements and takes into account proposed&#13;
interventions from other donors. Specifically, KfW is funding rehabilitation of parts of the Kabul&#13;
transmission and distribution networks of part of west Kabul, and the partial establishment of a 110 kV&#13;
substation at Breshna Kot in Kabul. The IDA grant funds will be used to concentrate on repair and&#13;
reconstruction of hydro and thermal generation in Kabul, and transmission and distribution in some&#13;
secondary cities as well as some urgently needed repairs, not covered by KfW, in Kabul.&#13;
14.   The Grant will help to prepare follow-on projects, which will address many of the problems&#13;
described above and which can only be resolved over a longer time span. These will likely include: (i)&#13;
the rebuilding of the transmission lines from Naghlu to Gulbahar, and from Pulikhumri to Kunduz; (ii) the&#13;
further expansion of the Breshna Kot substation in Kabul, (iii) the replacement with modem, more&#13;
efficient, higher capacity generating plant, which will utilize the same quantities of river water as is&#13;
currently used, in the Mahipar, Naghlu and Sarobi, Darunta, Pulikumri II, and other hydro power stations;&#13;
(iv) the procurement and installation of the long since planned third and final unit (18.5 MW) in the&#13;
existing Kajakai hydroelectric power station; (v) the installation of the combined cycle unit at the gas&#13;
turbine plant in Kabul and (vi) reconstruction, modernization and standardization of Afghanistan's&#13;
transmission and distribution networks.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
C. Oil and Gas&#13;
1.    The petroleum sector, when efficiently managed, can contribute significantly to the economic&#13;
development of any nation. Afghanistan has significant potential oil and gas resources. This potential,&#13;
however, is under explored. Initial hydrocarbon exploration activities carried out by Russia was&#13;
perfunctory and had concentrated only at shallow productive geological horizons. Due to the political&#13;
disturbances, no exploration activities have been conducted after 1979. Recoverable reserves of oil are&#13;
estimated at 14 million tons, and the gas reserves estimated at about 120 billion cubic meters (bcm) with&#13;
the likelihood of additional reserves of about 1000 bcm at deeper horizons (at depths greater than 3000&#13;
meters). Currently, petroleum products are supplied by several local private sector entrepreneurs with&#13;
minimum government control, monitoring or management. Infrastructure for local production of oil and&#13;
gas are currently not functional and the level of local expertise in oil and gas exploration and producticn&#13;
is limited. There is currently no foreign private sector participation in the overall sector. All these factors&#13;
have contributed to the country's inability to develop its hydrocarbon resources. As a result, Afghanistan&#13;
remains a country with attractive untapped oil and gas potential.&#13;
2.     The AIA has developed a strategy that would create a petroleum sector that is efficient and cost&#13;
effective in meeting the demand of products and services at least economic, financial and environmental&#13;
cost to the country, while at the same time promote the development of the country's hydrocarbon&#13;
potential, institution capacity and manpower needs for the sector. The AIA, however, is aware that in&#13;
order to achieve the objectives of this strategy it would have to establish an enabling environment that&#13;
would attract investments from both private local and international groups. This will also require&#13;
strengthening the capability of government institutions and to equip them with logistical support and well&#13;
trained manpower to enable them control, manage and monitor activities in the sector efficiently.&#13;
3.    In this regard, the AIA plans to implement the following set of actions:&#13;
* Develop institutional capacity and improve the level of expertise of its manpower;&#13;
* Develop appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow the promotion of private&#13;
sector investment in the sector and the efficient development of the resources in an&#13;
environmentally and safe manner;&#13;
* Restore the capability for local production of oil and gas and the rehabilitation of essential&#13;
infrastructure to facilitate the transport of oil and gas;&#13;
* Promote to the private sector (local and foreign) new areas for exploration and production; and&#13;
facilitate technology transfer;&#13;
* Evaluate the economic and financial viability of local industries such as refinery, fertilizer, etc.;&#13;
and&#13;
* Evaluate the viability of the country as a preferred transit route for gas exports from the&#13;
surrounding former Soviet Union countries.&#13;
4.     The policy advice and other support to be provided under this component will assist the AIA to&#13;
implement this strategy and would be executed over a six month period. This will lay the foundation for a&#13;
number of additional activities that may be undertaken under future projects and with assistance from&#13;
other donors. Some activities that relate to the development of Cadastre and Data Management&#13;
Information Systems and the development of geological data maps are described in the section on mining.&#13;
The Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI) will be the principal beneficiary and agency responsible for&#13;
implementing the activities. The exact scope of the technical assistance is being formulated, but may&#13;
include:&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
(a)   Assistance and advice in the implementation of the restructuring of MIMI, to separate the&#13;
responsibilities for petroleum (oil and gas) from mining into two distinct departments,&#13;
and the development and implementation of programs for training the staff of the&#13;
ministry and the agencies;&#13;
(b)   Advice on creation of an independent Directorate within the Ministry for petroleum&#13;
resources development that would be vested with the exclusive mandate to design, draft&#13;
and implement policies in the sector;&#13;
(c)   Analyze existing legislation and regulations pertaining to petroleum  resources&#13;
development with a view of preparing a modem legal regulatory framework as part of a&#13;
"Declaration of Sector policy" that would: (i) set the basic rules and regulations that&#13;
would govern petroleum operations in the country; (ii) regulate these activities as they are&#13;
carried out by both domestic and international enterprises; and (iii) define the principal&#13;
administrative, economic and fiscal guidelines for promoting investment activities in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
5.    The outcome could be a legal and regulatory framework that would include a new Petroleum&#13;
Law, Petroleum regulations, Modem Concession and Production Agreements that would be in line with&#13;
international best practices and would facilitate the promotion of private sector interest in the sector.&#13;
6.     Another component could provide assistance to MMI in undertaking several studies for&#13;
promoting the development of the petroleum resources of the country. The hydrocarbon potential of&#13;
Afghanistan has not been fully explored. Geologically, two petroleum basins (the Amu-Darya and the&#13;
Afghan -Tajik basins) extend southwards from the countries of the Former Soviet Union into the north&#13;
and north western parts of Afghanistan. These basins are considered to be highly productive. The Amu-&#13;
Darya basin, which is productive in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, is estimated to have recoverable&#13;
reserves of over 200 trillion cubic meters of gas (or 37 billion barrels of oil equivalent). Although also&#13;
found productive in Afghanistan, this basin has not been fully or comprehensively explored. The only&#13;
exploration done in this basin was carried out perfunctorily by the Russians in the 1970s during which&#13;
about 250 billion cubic meters of recoverable gas reserves and 14 million tons of oil reserves were found&#13;
in the shallow horizons (at depths less than 3000 meters). The other basin which is productive in&#13;
Tajikistan has not been explored in Afghanistan. In addition to these two basins, three other areas in&#13;
Afghanistan also have hydrocarbon potential. These are in the areas around Herat, the south and south&#13;
eastern parts, and the eastern part of the country, where Total Oil Company did some exploration&#13;
activities in 1976. These basins would need to be evaluated for their hydrocarbon potential with the&#13;
intention of promoting them to the private sector for exploration and development.&#13;
7.     Furthermore, there is need to evaluate the economic viability of utilizing the gas currently being&#13;
produced at Sherbagan for power and non-power demand in other parts of the country; and also to&#13;
evaluate the potential of the country as a transit route for gas export from the countries of former Soviet&#13;
Union (FSU) to the Arabian Sea. The following studies could be undertaken:&#13;
(a)   a geological, geophysical, geo-chemical analysis of the petroleum basins in the country&#13;
with the view of identifying areas that can be promoted for exploration of oil and gas&#13;
deposits; development of a concession map for these new areas to be promoted; and&#13;
development of a program for promoting these areas to interested local and foreign&#13;
private investors in several cities including Kabul (Houston, London, Singapore and&#13;
Moscow);&#13;
(b)   feasibility studies of: (i) a gas pipeline to transport gas from the Sherbergan area to Kabul&#13;
for power and non-power demand; (ii) development of a fertilizer and refinery plants in&#13;
the country; (iii) a cross country gas pipeline for the transport of gas from the FSU&#13;
countries through Afghanistan to the Arabian sea.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
D. Mining&#13;
1.    Mining can and does contribute to economic development and human well-being. If conducted in&#13;
an environmentally sustainable manner, exploitation of mineral resources can provide substantial tax&#13;
revenues to central and local governments, create direct and indirect jobs, and stimulate spin-off&#13;
industries in and around the mining operations. Exploration in Afghanistan has identified occurrences of&#13;
gold, barite, talc, chromites, and other minerals. However, to date, attempts to develop the iron ore and&#13;
copper deposits have not proven successful. There is a considerable, but as yet un-quantified, semi-&#13;
precious stone industry undertaken mainly by artisans. Quarry, construction and industrial minerals are&#13;
also exploited, although at a drastically reduced rate from previous years. Finally, the country has&#13;
reasonably good quality coal resources and some of this is mined for domestic and industrial purposes as&#13;
well as fuel for electricity generation. However, the coal exploitations have suffered due to antiquated&#13;
machinery and lack of new investment.&#13;
2.     However, the benefits from mining have eluded Afghanistan. Previous policies which fostered&#13;
the use of State institutions to find and develop the resources have not proven successful to generate&#13;
investment in the sector. For the past 15 years the country has been isolated politically and the public&#13;
institutions responsible for mining and the personnel in them have been unexposed to new developments&#13;
and international best practices in mining. Finally, for the past 25 years the security situation in the&#13;
country has limited the ability of the central government to establish national sovereignty over mineral&#13;
resources and to promote exploration and development of them.&#13;
3.     The AIA is conscious of the need for the central government to exert its control over valuable&#13;
non-renewable mineral resources. At the same time, the AIA is aware that development of the mineral&#13;
resources will require investments much larger than the can be provided from internal budgetary&#13;
resources and thus seeks to establish an enabling environment which is conducive to investments by both&#13;
private local and international groups. In order to manage its prerogatives as owner of mineral resources&#13;
and to stimulate the private sector, it will be necessary to strengthen government oversight institutions&#13;
and to equip them with logistical support and personnel required for the task.&#13;
4.     The policy advice and other support to be provided to the MMI will be executed over&#13;
approximately six months. Additional activities may be undertaken under a subsequent project or by&#13;
other donors, essentially to reinforce and build upon the reforms introduced during the present project. It&#13;
is expected to include the following activities:&#13;
(i) Policy Dialogue and Strategic Vision for the Mining Sector.&#13;
*  Prepare a baseline assessment of the current situation with respect to national policies, legislation,&#13;
taxation, institutional structure, small scale mining, quarry and industrial materials, inventory and&#13;
conditions of existing enterprises, social and economic impacts of mining, and other existing&#13;
conditions.&#13;
* Examine the international mining context, specifically with reference to international best&#13;
practices with Afghanistan should adopt in order to attract and retain local and international&#13;
investment.&#13;
*  Provide training for a limited number of officials and reinforce certain logistical support to the&#13;
Ministry.&#13;
*  Help conduct a national dialogue on mining policy and strategy involving relevant stakeholders.&#13;
*  Assist in the formulation of a "declaration of sector policy" which will be endorsed by the&#13;
highest political leadership in the country. These policies will serve as the basis for further&#13;
reform of the mining sector conducted in subsequent activities.&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
(ii)   Reform of the Mining Law, Regulations, and Tax Regime. Based upon the policies adopted&#13;
during the previous activity would involve both local and international legal, regulatory and tax&#13;
experts and:&#13;
* Analyze the existing legislation and regulations pertaining to mining (including sector specific&#13;
and other legislation) with a view producing a new mining law and regulations.&#13;
* Draft the new mining law and regulations and help to explain it to the political leadership.&#13;
* Prepare tax policies and regulations and manuals specific to the mining sector in line with&#13;
international practice.&#13;
* Produce procedural manuals to implement the law and regulations, specifically in terms of title&#13;
issuance, registry, health and safety and environment.&#13;
*  Provide training to certain ministry and other staff in administration of mining legislation.&#13;
(iii) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. This could include assisting the AIA to&#13;
restructure the public institutions responsible for oversight of the sector and to build capacity so that&#13;
personnel may become proficient with modern management techniques. In addition, it will provide&#13;
assistance to set up a proper mining title registry, cadastre office, and data management system.&#13;
Specific activities include:&#13;
* Analysis of existing structure and organization of the ministry with reference to how other&#13;
successful mining countries organize and staff the public sector oversight institutions.&#13;
* Conduct a skills and needs assessment of existing Ministry staff and recommend re-deployment,&#13;
training, and re-structuring.&#13;
* Provide training for ministry personnel in the new skills necessary to effectively administer the&#13;
sector in line with the new organizational set-up.&#13;
Possible joint Activities for both the Mining and Oil and Gas Sectors&#13;
Geo-Spatial Mapping.&#13;
5.     Proper cartography and maps making use of advanced research techniques in the earth sciences&#13;
are essential to a number of uses: geology, water resources, vegetation patterns, seismic detection,&#13;
environmental protection, and other uses. Afghanistan has been relatively extensively mapped from a&#13;
geology point of view, even though much of this information may be in donor countries and not&#13;
Afghanistan. In addition, the Afghanistan Information and Mapping System (AIMS) project has been&#13;
working under the auspices of the UNDP for the past seven years to improve the basic cartography of the&#13;
country and to integrate the datasets into an operational GIS system. The work to be undertaken under&#13;
this international consultant contract is only the initial step towards geo-spatial mapping. Follow-on&#13;
projects could build upon this initial work. The initial work undertaken will:&#13;
* Collect and compile existing geology and other maps pertaining to the earth sciences;&#13;
* Standardize and digitize these existing maps to conform to international standards and those used&#13;
by the AIMS project.&#13;
* Integrate the earth science maps into the overall GIS system being developed for the country.&#13;
* Coordinate with other relevant government agencies and other projects to supply needed earth&#13;
science information for purposes such as geology, petroleum, seismic detection, hydrology,&#13;
vegetation cover, environment and other uses.&#13;
* Provide for the dissemination of the maps and information to the public through all available&#13;
means, printed and electronic.&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Cadastre and Data Management Information System.&#13;
6.     The comerstone for effective management of mineral resources (including oil and gas) is a&#13;
modem mine title administration and cadastre system. Afghanistan to date does not have an adequate&#13;
registry or recording of exploration and exploitation titles. It is essential to rapidly move to establish such&#13;
a system in order to render effective the dispositions of the new mine law. In addition, proper legal title&#13;
and registry of claims will be an essential element to establish central govemment control over national&#13;
mineral resources and remove possibilities for abuse. This sub-component could provide technical&#13;
services, computer hardware and software, and training to the appropriate unit of the Ministry of Mines&#13;
and Industry to:&#13;
* Set up and equip to a functional level a new mining cadastre office, including procedure manuals&#13;
and computer hardware and software.&#13;
* Train Afghan personnel to use the new system.&#13;

ANNEX III: PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Institutional Capacity&#13;
The project envisages three main components:&#13;
Component 1: Urban Services&#13;
Component 2: Power&#13;
Component 3: Policy Advice and Other Support&#13;
The IDA Emergency Public Administration Project is funding the services of a Procurement&#13;
Agent to support the AACA and various ministries. The Procurement Agent will be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of all goods, works and consultancy services for the Emergency Infrastructure&#13;
Reconstruction Project.&#13;
In view of the post-conflict environment in the country, the procurement risk is considered high,&#13;
despite the use of procurement expertise of the specialized firm (Procurement Agent) in the AACA.&#13;
Project supervision will include procurement expertise in most missions over the life of the IDA Grant.&#13;
Threshold limits described below have been set considering these risks.&#13;
B. Procurement Methods&#13;
The procurement arrangements and the estimated costs for the project components to be funded&#13;
by IDA are shown in Table A. Procurement under the IDA Grant would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and&#13;
August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999).&#13;
The "Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of Consultants" (July 1997, Revised April 1998&#13;
and July 1999) would be used for all consulting services. For the procurement of works and goods, IDA&#13;
shall suggest appropriate bidding documents/contract formats to be used.&#13;
General Procurement Notice for this project has been published in the on-line version of UNDB.&#13;
Bl: Procurement of Goods (US$17.6 Million)&#13;
The procurement of goods consists of items such as transmission and distribution materials,&#13;
essential tools, vehicles, office equipment, spare parts for repair/replacement/ re-commissioning of hydro&#13;
power stations/gas turbine (including supply of fuel), equipments for water supply, sanitation and solid-&#13;
waste. Modified International Competitive Bidding (MICB), International/National Shopping (IS/NS),&#13;
procurement through UN Procurement Agency (UN Procurement) and Direct Contracting (DC)&#13;
procedures will be used.&#13;
Modified ICB (US$3 M): This will be used for purchase of fuel for the gas turbine in accordance&#13;
with para 2.65 of the Guidelines involving multiple awards over the project period. Bidders can send&#13;
their requests by fax and no bid security would be required.&#13;
International/National Shopping (US$11.5 M): This will be used for goods estimated to cost less&#13;
than or equal to US$500,000 equivalent per contract. The contract packages are expected to be in the&#13;
range of US$10,000 to US$200,000 with few contracts of up to US$500,000. Under shopping&#13;
34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX III&#13;
procedures, the Procurement Agent will use simplified documents and procedures for soliciting, receiving&#13;
and evaluating competitive quotations from usually at least three suppliers (in International Shopping&#13;
from two different countries). The shopping method to be used will be based on IDA's memorandum of&#13;
June 8, 2000, Guidance Procurement Notes on handling procurement under Shopping Method. In view of&#13;
the emergency operations, the threshold will be higher than the normal limit of US$ 100,000.&#13;
Procurement through UN Procurement Agency (US$0.5 M): This will be used for goods&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 or equivalent per contract, with the UN acting as suppliers&#13;
pursuant to their own procedures.&#13;
Direct Contracting (DC) (US$2.6 M): This will be used for procurement of spares for repair and&#13;
rehabilitation of power stations from the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). It is expected that&#13;
there will be two to three contracts in the range of US$400,000 to US$2,000,000 each.&#13;
B2: Works (US$10.9 Million)&#13;
Works will comprise of reconstruction and upgrading of sub-station, repair/ installation of pumps,&#13;
pipes, reconstruction work for sanitation, sewers, solid waste management, drain cleaning, clearing of&#13;
rubble, improvement of parks, etc.&#13;
Ouotation. Direct Contracting. Force Account and Community Participation (US$10.9M)&#13;
As the above work comprises many small value items scattered over a wide area and under busy&#13;
city conditions, the same will be procured on the basis of (i) lump sum fixed price contract soliciting&#13;
quotations from at least three qualified suppliers/contractors; (ii) direct contracting with a qualified&#13;
supplier/contractor; or (iii) through community participation procedures in accordance with paragraph&#13;
3.15 of the Guidelines. The value of each contract will be less than the equivalent US$50,000 in each of&#13;
the above three cases.&#13;
Force account procedure is being used for scattered/emergency work for an aggregate limit of&#13;
US$1,800,000.&#13;
B3: Consulting Services and Training (US$4.5 Million)&#13;
Although for consulting services the preferred selection method should be Quality and Cost&#13;
Based Selection (QCBS), it is envisaged that for some consultancies, for quicker selection, the method to&#13;
be used is Selection based on Consultants' Qualification (CQ). (This means seeking of Expressions of&#13;
Interest (EOI) based on brief TOR, specifying in the EOI criteria for establishing a shortlist with a view to&#13;
selecting the firm with the most appropriate qualification and references. The selected firm will be asked&#13;
to submit a combined technical-financial proposal before being invited for negotiations). The EOI for&#13;
these consultancies shall be published in UNDB/ Development Gateway and other targeted&#13;
announcements. For major consultancies the description, estimated cost and method of selection are as&#13;
under:&#13;

ANNEX IV: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT &amp; DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
Since there is no Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country Financial&#13;
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate knowledge of country issues and&#13;
related strengths and weaknesses. Financial management capacity in the country is not fully functional&#13;
and appropriate mitigation measures have been suggested through the engagement of the Financial&#13;
Management Agent.&#13;
Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
Strength: The engagement of the Financial Management Agent, along with the AlA's&#13;
commitment to transparent and accountable financial management, are the primary strengths of the&#13;
Project financial management.&#13;
StaffMng and Training&#13;
The Financial Management Agent will support the MOF, the line ministries and other&#13;
implementing agencies to perform the necessary financial management functions. One of the critical&#13;
functions of the Financial Management Agent will be to provide hands-on support to implementing&#13;
agency staff to enhance their financial management capacity.&#13;
Accounfing Policies and Procedures&#13;
The Project will follow standard AIA financial management policies and procedures, including&#13;
using the AIA Chart of Accounts to record Project expenditures. The use of these procedures will allow&#13;
for adequate recording and reporting of Project expenditures&#13;
Accounts will be consolidated centrally in the MOF (by the Financial Management Agent) for all&#13;
implementing entities and consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and&#13;
uses of Project funds.&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General with the support of the Audit&#13;
Agent with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project financial statement to&#13;
the Association would include a summary of funds received (showing funds received from all sources),&#13;
and a summnary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/ activities and by main&#13;
categories of expenditures. The format of the annual Project financial statements will be similar to the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The audit of the Project accounts would also include an&#13;
assessment of: (a) the adequacy of the accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain&#13;
adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association&#13;
financing. The annual Project financial statements audited by the Auditor General would be submitted&#13;
within 6 months of the close of AIA's fiscal year. The following audit reports will be monitored in the&#13;
Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;

Special Account&#13;
The Auditor General will audit the accounts of all the implementing entities. However, a&#13;
consolidated audit report (with consolidated financial statements) will be issued for the project.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i) sources and uses of funds&#13;
by disbursement category and project component; (ii) physical progress; and (iii) status of procurement&#13;
activities. These will be submitted to the Association within 45 days of the end of the quarter.&#13;

Total Project Costs          33,000,000&#13;
Financing Percentage.  Since collection of tax revenue has just begun and is sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentages have been set at 100 percent with the understanding, however, that MOF will&#13;
submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. The tax structure of the AIA will be reviewed&#13;
within six months of Grant signing at which time standard disbursement percentages will be set and&#13;
financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
Retroactive Financing. Provision has been made to reimburse AIA for payments it makes, up to&#13;
SDR 3.5 million, between April 1, 2002 and Grant signing for Project expenditures.&#13;
Disbursement Method.   Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with full&#13;
documentation or against statements of expenditures as appropriate.&#13;
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis of SOEs for:&#13;
(a) consultants and training for contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals; and (b) works and goods for contracts not exceeding US$300,000.&#13;
Special Account. A Special Account would be opened and maintained in a bank acceptable to the&#13;
Association; and would be operated by MOF in accordance with the Association's operational policies.&#13;
The Authorized Allocation of the Special Account would be US$3.3 million which represents the&#13;
estimated amount of expenditures to course through the Special Account in a 3-month period. Given the&#13;
short disbursement period and the immediate need for special account funds, the full amount of the&#13;
Authorized Allocation of the Special Account will be available to MOF upon effectiveness.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX IV&#13;
Minimum application size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) monthly, or (2) when the Special Account balance is reduced by 40 percent, whichever&#13;
comes first. The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct&#13;
payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation of the&#13;
Special Account. In the event that banking facilities are not fully functional at Grant effectiveness, IDA&#13;
may, on an exceptional basis, waive minimum application size requirements in order to accommodate&#13;
urgent needs.&#13;
Authority to withdraw Grant funds. MOF will retain the right to sign and submit withdrawal&#13;
applications to the Association.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive supervision. The focus&#13;
during the supervision will be on the internal control arrangements for the Project and functioning of&#13;
accounting, financial reporting and auditing.&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V: ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK&#13;
I.     Objectives&#13;
The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework provides general policies, guidelines, codes of&#13;
practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of World Bank supported emergency&#13;
reconstruction operations in Afghanistan. Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective of&#13;
the Framework is to help ensure that activities under the proposed reconstruction operations will:&#13;
*      Protect human health;&#13;
*      Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
*      Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their&#13;
cumulative effects;&#13;
*      Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
*      Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
II.    General Principles&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations, and the related&#13;
need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing&#13;
potential environmental and social risks, this Framework is based on the following principles:&#13;
1. The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which may not&#13;
be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation&#13;
for the selection and design of subprojects, and the planning of mitigation measures;&#13;
2. The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will not support environmental Category A&#13;
subprojects8, nor subprojects requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or more people.&#13;
Consequently, no Environmental Impact Assessments (ElAs) or Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
(RAPs) will be required. With the exception of support for the emergency rehabilitation of the&#13;
Kabul North-West power plant, no subprojects requiring separate, site-specific environmental or&#13;
social reports will be supported. With this exception, all proposed subprojects will be screened to&#13;
ensure that the environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the&#13;
application of standardized guidelines and codes of practice;&#13;
3. Activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment, such as those entailing the construction&#13;
or installation of new or significantly expanded infrastructure, will be supported under subsequent&#13;
operations. The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will finance feasibility and&#13;
detailed design studies for these subsequent investments, which will include environmental and&#13;
social impact assessments as required by World Bank safeguard policies;&#13;
4. Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity between&#13;
genders, and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density.&#13;
Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the&#13;
basis of professional competence, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. In all&#13;
projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated&#13;

43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the female population, along with that of the&#13;
male population; and,&#13;
5. Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of these&#13;
operations. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the World&#13;
Bank Infoshop.&#13;
III.   Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be consistent with the&#13;
following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements:&#13;
*     A negative list of characteristics that would make a proposed subproject ineligible for&#13;
support, as indicated in Attachment 1;&#13;
*      Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, presented in&#13;
Attachment 2;&#13;
*     Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of&#13;
archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites, provided in&#13;
Attachment 3;&#13;
*     Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the mitigation of potential environmental&#13;
impacts, presented in Attachment 4; and,&#13;
*     The requirement that confirmation is received through the Regional Mine Action Center&#13;
that areas to be accessed during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities have been&#13;
demined.&#13;
In addition to these requirements, an environmental audit will be conducted as part of feasibility study&#13;
and detailed design for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West power plant.&#13;
IV.    Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed operations, including the&#13;
Ministries of Reconstruction and Rural Development, Public Works, Power, and Housing, Planning and&#13;
Building. Each Ministry will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation&#13;
requirements to its own subprojects.&#13;
Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the&#13;
implementation of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework.&#13;
V.     Capacity Building And Monitoring Of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
As part of the capacity building that will be provided for implementation of the proposed operations, the&#13;
Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive training in the&#13;
application of the Safeguard Framework.&#13;
To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the application of&#13;
the Framework, GoA will contract specialist social and environmental services. During supervision of&#13;
these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the Framework, and if required will&#13;
recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
VI.    Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was prepared in consultation with the principal&#13;
NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. It will be&#13;
disclosed by GoA in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made available at the&#13;
World Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
The environmental audit to be prepared for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West thermal power&#13;
station will be made publicly available by GoA, and at the World Bank Infoshop. Since no other separate&#13;
environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under the proposed reconstruction&#13;
operations, no additional disclosure requirements will apply. In this regard, however, it is worth noting&#13;
that GoA intends to make all project documentation publicly available through the Afghan Information&#13;
Management System (AIMS).&#13;
The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies for future&#13;
infrastructure investments, for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and&#13;
disclosure will apply. In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments9 proposed for future&#13;
operations, the implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local nongovernmental&#13;
organizations about the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.&#13;
The implementing agency will initiate such consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful&#13;
consultations, will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and&#13;
language that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.&#13;
For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least twice, (i) shortly after&#13;
environmental screening and before the terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
(ELA) are finalized, and (ii) once a draft ELA report is prepared. For the initial consultation, the&#13;
implementing agency will provide a summary of the proposed project's objectives, description, and&#13;
potential impacts. For both Category A and B projects, the implementing agency will provide these&#13;
groups with a summary of the EIA report's conclusions. In addition, the implementing agency will make&#13;
the draft reports available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs.&#13;

ANNEX V&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition. Entitlements and Compensation&#13;
I. Objectives&#13;
Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be involuntarily displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed by the proposed emergency reconstruction operations. Subproject proposals that&#13;
would require demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize&#13;
or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion&#13;
along rights of way should be reviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of&#13;
these guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition Assessment is attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that all&#13;
such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be assisted to improve, or at&#13;
least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to pre-project levels.&#13;
Categorization&#13;
Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People, PAPs) and&#13;
the magnitude of impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
a.     S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement of more than 200 PAPs and where a&#13;
full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions will be ineligible&#13;
for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
b.     S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement of less than 200 persons. In such&#13;
cases, the following documentation is required: (1) a land acquisition assessment, (2) the&#13;
Minutes or record of consultations which assess the compensation claimed and agreement&#13;
reached, and (3) a record of the receipt of the compensation, or voluntary donation, by those&#13;
affected (see below).&#13;
c.     S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse&#13;
social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved livelihoods&#13;
are expected from such interventions.&#13;
II. Eligibility&#13;
PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affected by the project. PAPs&#13;
deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;

ANNEX V&#13;
Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation&#13;
PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
a.   Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals may elect to&#13;
voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or permanently from their&#13;
land without compensation.&#13;
b.   Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected" will&#13;
be eligible for compensation from the local community or alternatively from the&#13;
Government. A PAP shall lodge his/her claim for compensation to the local community&#13;
representatives/shura head and it shall be verified by the implementing agency. The claim&#13;
shall be lodged within 2 weeks of completion of the consultations with the concerned&#13;
community, and before project implementation begins.&#13;
Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.  The&#13;
documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other claims. A format&#13;
is attached in Attachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any compensation&#13;
claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
III. Compensation Principles&#13;
The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any of the following means of compensation are&#13;
provided in a timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
(1)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets with the&#13;
remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at replacement cost for&#13;
that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost assets will be according to&#13;
following principles:&#13;
a.    replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent productive&#13;
assets;&#13;
b.     materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
c.    replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
d.     other acceptable in-kind compensation;&#13;
e.    in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in public, i.e.&#13;
at the Community Meeting.&#13;
(2)    Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets&#13;
rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation for the&#13;
entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset, according to the&#13;
principles in (1) a-d above.&#13;
Consultation Process&#13;
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in a&#13;
proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community meetings for each&#13;
affected mantaqa/gozar (urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to inform the local population&#13;
about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these Guidelines. The&#13;
49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
Minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held, agreements reached, and include&#13;
details of the agreement, based on the format provided in Attachment 2(ii).&#13;
The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and&#13;
any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project documentation and be available for&#13;
inspection during supervision.&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing agency shall:&#13;
a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the&#13;
affected person and the local community;&#13;
b. not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory manner to&#13;
the affected persons;&#13;
c. if more than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the subproject shall be&#13;
deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village level. If&#13;
this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the agreements recorded&#13;
in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying out the project can also be&#13;
addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the municipal or district level. If this also fails,&#13;
the complaint may be submitted to the relevant implementing agency for a decision.&#13;
Verification&#13;
The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of compensation&#13;
having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers, who will&#13;
maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they undertake reviews and&#13;
post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all relevant project documents, including&#13;
details of the relevant authority for complaints at municipal/district or implementing agency level.&#13;

Attachment 3&#13;
Protection of Cultural Pronerty&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of "outstanding universal value"&#13;
from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point of view, including&#13;
unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural property is defined as&#13;
sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, or religious&#13;
significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risk of damaging cultural&#13;
property, as the sub-projects will largely consist of small investments in community infrastructure and&#13;
income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor urban public works.&#13;
Further, the negative list of attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for support (Attachment&#13;
1), includes any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable cultural property. Nevertheless,&#13;
the following procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment of chance finds should be&#13;
followed and included in standard bid documents.&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance of Historical and Cultural Monuments&#13;
(Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities of cultural heritage&#13;
agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course of project implementation. This law establishes&#13;
that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment of historical and cultural&#13;
monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry of Information and&#13;
Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
2. Whenever chance finds of cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are made the&#13;
Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of work endanger the&#13;
historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended until a solution is found for&#13;
the preservation of these artifacts.&#13;
3. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact is found in the countryside of a&#13;
province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal) should be informed&#13;
within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In case the immovable&#13;
historical or cultural artifact is found in a city, the provincial branch of the Department of&#13;
Maintenance of Historical Values of the Ministry of Information and Culture should be informed&#13;
within two weeks (art. 18). If the find is made within the center, the Archaeological Committee&#13;
must be informed directly within one week (art. 25).&#13;
4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a fine or&#13;
imprisonment for a period of one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
5. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay&#13;
compensation in accordance with the value of the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period of one&#13;
month to ten years depending on the gravity of the crime (art. 71).&#13;
54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX V&#13;
In case of a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the implementing&#13;
agency is responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage until the responsibility&#13;
has been taken over by the relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness of the project's&#13;
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity building activities, as appropriate.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency
            Infrastructure Reconstruction Project is to improve selected
            infrastructure service delivery, in order to enhance the
            quality of life, health status, and welfare of the
            population, and to support the economic recovery of the
            country. This will be achieved by: 1) carrying out urgent
            reconstruction, and rehabilitation works to restore critical
            urban services, and power; 2) providing employment
            opportunities, through labor-based reconstruction
            activities; and, 3) providing urgently needed policy advice,
            and capacity building to the Government, in selected
            sectors, to promote sustainable infrastructure service
            delivery, which fosters community, and private sector participation.
