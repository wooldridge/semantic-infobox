            The authors look at the rise of the
            Internet as the main application behind the emerging global
            information infrastructure. Many now believe that the
            Internet provides a window into a future in which access to
            information will be independent of geographic location and
            interactivity in a multimedia environment will be
            ubiquitous. The authors review the need for a regulatory
            framework for the Internet in three critical areas:
            provision of backbone access, Internet service providers,
            and information services. They also explore the problem of
            the appropriability of content, discussing intellectual
            property rights in the digital era and other remedies to the
            cost recovery problem. For developing countries, however,
            the critical bottleneck is still their weak information infrastructure.
