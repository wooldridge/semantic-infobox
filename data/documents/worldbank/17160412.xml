to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply&#13;

to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's&#13;
obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.    Mana2ement of the Contributions&#13;

signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund&#13;
fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust&#13;
