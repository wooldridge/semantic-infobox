REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND BANK STRATEGY&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1. 1         The Government of Kazakstan has requested World Bank assistance to finance a project&#13;
in support of irrigation and drainage rehabilitation and improvement. The proposed project would&#13;
rehabilitate irrigation and drainage infrastructure covering some 30,000 ha. of on-farm irrigation as well&#13;
as limited inter-farm works, promote development of privatized farms through pilot initiatives for farmer&#13;
training and information, and strengthen the environmental capacity of concerned ministries and agencies.&#13;
The proposed project is the fourth bank-financed investment project in Kazakstan and the first in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
B. Sector Overview&#13;
1.2          Agriculture is a major contributor to Kazakstan's economy. It accounts for about one-&#13;
quarter of GDP and around 23 percent of total employment. Livestock contributes between 50 to 60&#13;
percent of total output with beef, mutton, dairy products and wool being the major livestock products.&#13;
The crop sector is dominated by grain, mostly wheat, which accounts for about 65 percent of total crop&#13;
output. Other important crops are fodder crops, potatoes, and vegetables. Agriculture continues to be&#13;
a major source of export earnings with agricultural products constituting about ten percent. Major&#13;
exports include grain, meat, and wool.&#13;
1.3          About 200 M ha, or 75 percent of Kazakstan's total land area, is used for cropping and&#13;
grazing, with most agricultural land-devoted to extensive livestock grazing. Kazakstan can be divided&#13;
into three distinct geographical areas: the South, where most irrigated agriculture takes place; the North&#13;
where most rain-fed crop and livestock production occurs; and the expansive central region, which is&#13;
suitable mainly for extensive grazing. Cropped land covers about 35 million ha, of which nearly 33&#13;
million ha is rain-fed and about 2.4 million ha is irrigated. Cereals cover about 62 percent of total&#13;
cropped area with forage and vegetable crops accounting for most of the rest.&#13;
1.4          Kazakstan has a typical continental climate with cold, dry winters and hot dry summers.&#13;
Annual precipitation in the agricultural lands varies from less than 150 mm in the extreme Southwest to&#13;
nearly 450 mm in the foothills of the Southern mountains. Kazakstan is primarily located on steppes and&#13;
much of the Southern part of the country is desert. Soils are moderately fertile. Soils in the desert area&#13;
have a high natural salt content and tend to be alkaline, making them vulnerable to surface salinity under&#13;
conditions of poor irrigation and drainage. About 26 percent of the land is vulnerable to erosion,&#13;
primarily by wind.&#13;
1.5          Most production takes place on the recently privatized successors to state and collective&#13;
farms. State farms, which numbered about 2,100 before privatization, were particularly large, averaging&#13;
80,000 ha in 1992 of which just over 13,000 ha were cultivated. Nearly a third of these farms are&#13;
located in the North and produce rain-fed grain. Another 600 farms are engaged in extensive sheep&#13;
raising and 380 are intensive dairy and beef operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.6          Collective farms or their successors number about 430 and are smaller than state farms&#13;
with average cultivated area of about 9,800 ha. Collectives tend to be more diversified in production than&#13;
the former state farms but traditionally in terms of management there has been little difference between&#13;
the two. As in other parts of the FSU, private plots on state farms and near urban centers are playing&#13;
a growing role in total output particularly for meat, milk, vegetables and fruit.&#13;
1.7          Performance in agriculture since independence has been poor. Output in the sector fell&#13;
by about 13 percent in 1994, following a 12 percent decline in 1993 and an average 5.3 percent decline&#13;
per annum between 1990 and 1993.  Last year saw another poor harvest with grain production&#13;
particularly hard hit. Declining yields are primarily the cause of lower output though area cropped has&#13;
also declined. Yields have been adversely affected by sharp declines in input usage. Fertilizer utilization&#13;
has dropped by two-thirds since 1992, fuel shortages have disrupted planting and harvesting activities,&#13;
and worn-out farm machinery has not been replaced.&#13;
1.8          The financial position of most farms has deteriorated markedly in the past three years,&#13;
with a sharp increase in the number of farms reporting losses. The losses have been due largely to&#13;
official pricing and marketing policy that depressed producer prices well below world market levels while&#13;
the prices of inputs were liberalized. The resulting cost price squeeze served to tax the sector by an&#13;
estimated US$323 to US$756 million in 1993.&#13;
C. Agricultural Policy Reforms&#13;
1.9          The Government has accelerated its reform program in agriculture over the last two years&#13;
in an effort to stem the crisis in the sector and restore growth in output and improve productivity and&#13;
rural incomes. The focus of the reform program in agriculture is on three key areas: (i) price and&#13;
government trade policy; (ii) marketing reform; and (iii) farm privatization and restructuring. Price and&#13;
trade reform is aimed at ending the cost-price squeeze facing agriculture through measures to allow farm&#13;
prices to rise to world market levels. The measures include an end to compulsory delivery of agricultural&#13;
commodities to the Government at fixed and low prices relative to world market prices and trade reforms&#13;
aimed at ending restrictions on agricultural exports. Government procurement of commodities has&#13;
decreased from over 20 million tons per annum as recently as 1992 to less than 800,000 tons for 1995,&#13;
and new rules for public procurement have been implemented to make it voluntary with competitively&#13;
determined prices.&#13;
1.10         Market reforms are aimed at privatizing the state enterprises that were formerly&#13;
responsible for all aspects of marketing and processing of agriculture commodities and encouraging the&#13;
entrance of new trading, input supply and processing firms into the sector. Privatization of the state&#13;
agricultural enterprises is nearly complete in a process that has transferred ownership to the suppliers of&#13;
the enterprises and the workers. New entrants to the sector are being encouraged by the gradual&#13;
development of a legal, and regulatory environment conducive to commerce. Already much of the old&#13;
structure for marketing and processing of livestock products, and fruits and vegetables has been bypassed&#13;
by private sector marketing channels. Less progress has been made in the development of alternative&#13;
channels for grain trade though even there private traders and exporters are offering increasing&#13;
competition to former state-owned firms.&#13;
1.11         Farm privatization also has moved quickly (Annex A). Farm privatization in Kazakstan&#13;
began seriously in 1991, with the advent of legislation defining objectives and methods. Subsequent&#13;
legislation has further refined the process and the timetable including passage of the end of 1995 of a new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
land code and supporting legislation on land registration. By the end of 1995 over 80 percent of former&#13;
state farms had gone through the privatization process and the remainder are slated to be privatized early&#13;
in 1996. Privatization in Kazakstan refers to land management, and does not result in private land&#13;
ownership. Rather, the State retains ownership of all land and confers inheritable use rights to the&#13;
workers, the managers, and sometimes to other non-agricultural people in the farming community. These&#13;
lease rights can be sold, sub-let, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred.  On the farm  level, the&#13;
privatization process involves three steps. First the farms' land and non-land assets are evaluated and&#13;
entitlement to land leases and shares of non-land assets are distributed to eligible farm members. Second,&#13;
a period of formal and informal consultations are held with the farming community on the options and&#13;
process of privatization. Finally, a general assembly meeting of the farming community is held during&#13;
which the farm members decide on the post-privatization structure of the farm and the conditions of&#13;
membership/ownership, and elect the manager.&#13;
1.12          The initial decisions on the ownership and management structures have in most instances&#13;
been to adopt a cooperative ownership structure with management arrangements and operating procedures&#13;
similar to the former state model. This initial lack of restructuring can be traced to the harsh economic&#13;
environment within which the process is unfolding coupled with weaknesses in implementing the&#13;
privatization program. Information on alternative farm structures is often not available or inadequately&#13;
explained, and farm members are unclear about the procedures if they chose to opt out of the cooperative&#13;
and establish their own operation. Despite these weaknesses, there are growing indications that the first&#13;
decisions on how a farm will be structured are not final. Some farms have changed ownership structures&#13;
and managerial arrangements, often more than once. These changes are usually made to accommodate&#13;
the desire of some members to break away from the larger group and establish their own enterprises.&#13;
In such cases the management arrangements become more complex, incorporating a growing number of&#13;
units, either individual family farms, group farms, cooperatives, or other smaller units. This process is&#13;
expected to accelerate as the sector becomes more commercially oriented and experience is gained with&#13;
privatization procedures, and the cost-price squeeze is eased with the completion of price and trade&#13;
reform.&#13;
D. Sector Strategy and Bank Support&#13;
1.13          The Bank's strategy to assist the Government of Kazakstan is founded on four key pillars&#13;
including support for: (i) macroeconomic stabilization and price reform; (ii) transformation of the&#13;
economy to a competitive, market based system through privatization of state enterprises and encouraging&#13;
competition from new market participants; (iii) strengthened capacity for social protection; and (iv)&#13;
rehabilitation and improved management capacity for public infrastructure. For agriculture, the Bank's&#13;
approach rests firmly on these pillars. The Agricultural Sector Report of September 1994 identified low&#13;
output prices relative to world market prices as a fundamental factor affecting performance and&#13;
profitability in agriculture and suggested a number of reforms in pricing, government procurement of&#13;
agriculture commodities, and in trade policy designed to bring agricultural prices in line with world&#13;
market levels. These reforms were incorporated into the Development Policy Letter agreed in the context&#13;
of the FY95 Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL - Ln No. 3900).&#13;
1.14          The Sector Review also identified farm privatization and restructuring as important&#13;
elements of the reform program and the SAL includes conditionality on appropriate land legislation in&#13;
support of the development of land markets. Also, a proposed Land Registration Project (FY97) is&#13;
intended to strengthen the system  for registering rights to land and real property.  A proposed&#13;
Agricultural Privatization Support Project (FY98S) is intended to provide post-privatization support to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
emerging private farms. The proposed IDIP project would complement these initiatives and provide&#13;
support for the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure on irrigated farms that have been&#13;
privatized and are undergoing restructuring.&#13;
E. Bank Lending Experience&#13;
1.15          The Bank only has recently begun to lend for agricultural projects in Eastern Europe and&#13;
Central Asia and has limited project experience with countries in transition. The experience with&#13;
irrigation projects in these countries is limited to two irrigation rehabilitation projects, one in Albania and&#13;
one in Armenia. Common issues that have arisen for agricultural projects in general and these two&#13;
irrigation projects are:&#13;
*      the need for a stable macroeconomic environment and a favorable incentive&#13;
structure for the sector;&#13;
*      the importance of local ownership of project design and commitment to its&#13;
implementation;&#13;
*      the necessity of introducing rigorous economic and environmental criteria in the&#13;
design of programs and projects;&#13;
*      the importance of an adequate farm privatization program in conjunction with&#13;
initiatives to rehabilitate farm infrastructure, including irrigation facilities;&#13;
*      the need to transfer responsibilities and at least some of the operation costs and&#13;
maintenance to water users; and&#13;
*      the necessity  for strong oversight and implementation  capacity by the&#13;
implementing agency to assure that construction of irrigation work adhere to&#13;
international standards of quality.&#13;
1.16          These issues have been shared with Government and every effort has been made in project&#13;
preparation to address them in the design of the project. Implementation of the project will benefit from&#13;
the fact that Kazakstan has been one of the most successful and persistent countries in Central Asia in&#13;
pursing macro-economic and marketing and pricing reforms. It currently is implementing an aggressive&#13;
reform program with support of the SAL and an a IMF program that is intended to accelerate progress&#13;
with stabilization and remove remaining price and trade distortions affecting the sector. The importance&#13;
of beneficiary participation is being emphasized through a careful consultation process during project&#13;
preparation and implementation. Strict economic and environmental criteria were utilized to screen&#13;
potential projects in an exhaustive process to cull projects with unsatisfactory economic rates of return&#13;
or with potentially detrimental environmental impacts. Project design also has focused on improving cost&#13;
recovery for inter-farm systems and quality of construction.&#13;
1.17          More generally, OED's 1994 Review of World Bank Experience in Irrigation provides&#13;
evidence on performance and recurrent issues in some 200 Bank-financed irrigation projects. Although&#13;
67 percent of the projects were rated satisfactory (84 percent when weighted by size of area served),&#13;
operational performance has in general been poorer than anticipated at appraisal. It was found that&#13;
projects with relatively low unit costs per hectare tended to be more successful (project cost averaged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
US$4,800 ha)-'. The proposed project is in line with the report's major reconimendation that the Bank&#13;
should shift emphasis from financing new irrigation to upgrading existing irrigation. Critical factors&#13;
identified for project success include: quality of system design; quality of construction works; adequacy&#13;
of O&amp;M, and; the need to foster the conditions associated with the formation of durable irrigator groups.&#13;
The review also indicated that O&amp;M tends to be best in irrigation agencies that are financially&#13;
autonomous; the District Water Committees in Kazakstan are now  self-supporting.  It was also&#13;
recommended that O&amp;M entities should receive their funding directly from the irrigators where feasible;&#13;
also this is the case in Kazakstan.&#13;
1/     For the proposed project, average per ha investment cost is about US$2,250.&#13;

II. THE WATER SECTOR AND IRRIGATION SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. Water Resources&#13;
2.1            Water resources are limited. Annually recurring surface water resources total about 100&#13;
km3 (billion cubic meters), of which about 44 km3 originate in other countries. It is estimated that about&#13;
43 km3 are available for irrigation development. Less than 0.1 percent of the total land area is under&#13;
irrigation at present, with limited water supply for expansion.  Potential annual yield of usable&#13;
groundwater is estimated at 15 km', mostly in the Southeast, of which some 2.5 km3 has been developed.&#13;
Groundwater supplies at present are used for irrigation of about 85,000 ha.&#13;
2.2            Many rivers, especially the larger ones, have been provided long-term  and seasonal&#13;
regulation by reservoirs and storage ponds. Kazakstan now has 204 reservoirs, with a total capacity of&#13;
95.5 km3. The largest reservoirs are found in the basins of the Aral Sea, Lake Balkash, and the Irtysh&#13;
River. The salinity of reservoirs varies from 0.12 g/L in East Kazakstan to about 2.1-2.7 in the central&#13;
part of the country, with most reservoirs around I g/L.&#13;
B. Irrigation and Drainage Development&#13;
2.3            "Regular"Z' irrigation is practiced on 2.4 million ha (1990), of which 95.6 percent is by&#13;
surface water, 3.6 percent by groundwater, and 0.8 percent by sewage water. Surface irrigation is used&#13;
in 70 percent of the area, sprinkler in the remainder In addition, there are 878,500 ha of flood irrigated&#13;
lands. Drainage facilities have been provided for 623,000 ha (26 percent) of the regular irrigated lands.&#13;
Seventy percent of the irrigated area is in the five Southern oblasts. It is estimated that only about 70&#13;
percent of the land irrigated in 1990, or 1.7 million ha, is actually being irrigated in 1994. Almost&#13;
680,000 ha (30 percent) of the lands are out of use because of soil salinization, water logging, broken&#13;
or incomplete distribution systems, improper farming practices, limited inputs such as fertilizers and fuel,&#13;
and, in some instances, lack of water.&#13;
2.4            Major crops under irrigation in descending order of planted area are fodder crops (about&#13;
half the area) mainly alfalfa, winter wheat, maize (grain and silage), cotton, rice, sugar beets,&#13;
vegetables/onions/fruits, oil crops, potato and tobacco. Fodder crops are required for winter feeding of&#13;
the large livestock population and grown in many areas where salinity and poor drainage prevent other&#13;
crops from being grown. Total sown area, especially for fodder crops, is decreasing and crop yields have&#13;
declined from 15 percent to 40 percent in the last five years, primarily due to economic disruption.&#13;
2.5            Major inter-farm facilities include about 14,000 km of channels. Major problems in the&#13;
inter-farm systems include low operation efficiencies due to seepage in unlined canals, resulting in water&#13;
losses and waterlogging of adjacent lands. Maintenance is deficient and declining due to staff cuts and&#13;
shortage of funds. Water scheduling is quite rigid, in some cases leading to over irrigation and a rise&#13;
in the water-table. Privatization may present cost and operational problems in delivering water to the&#13;
smaller farm units.&#13;
2.6            The majority of irrigated lands in the five Southern oblasts, almost 90 percent, are&#13;
irrigated with surface methods, usually furrow and borders. About 75 percent of the irrigated land in&#13;
2/     'Regular' irrigation means irrigation by some specific technical, constructed method, such as border or sprinkler, at planned intervals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
the other oblasts is irrigated by large-scale sprinkler systems. Overall, about 1.65 million ha are irrigated&#13;
by surface and 0.68 million by sprinkler. Drip systems are rare and used mainly on an experimental&#13;
basis. The major on-farm problem is the lack of funds for maintenance and rehabilitation of facilities,&#13;
affecting yields and area irrigated.&#13;
2.7           Drainage systems have been constructed on only about 624,000 ha, or 26 percent of the&#13;
irrigated land. About 60 percent is by open ditch, 32 percent by vertical wells, and 7.8 percent by buried&#13;
horizontal pipe. There has been little development of new drainage and, little maintenance done since&#13;
about 1990. Still only 3.6 percent (86,000 ha) of the irrigated land has a water table less than 1.5 m&#13;
below the surface, and only 2.2 percent of the irrigated land (52,000 ha) is classed as highly saline.&#13;
However, and additional 170,000 ha (7.1 percent) are classed as mildly saline and that percentage will&#13;
undoubtedly increase (as will the percentage of highly saline land) if drainage systems are not improved.&#13;
Although new lands are not being developed for irrigation, new drainage works are also required for&#13;
irrigated lands that have not been previously drained.&#13;
2.8           Much of the agricultural drainage system  is not functioning properly because of&#13;
deficiencies in design, construction and maintenance. A significant problem also exists with disposal&#13;
of highly mineralized water. A strict policy of limiting or excluding disposal of drainage outflows in the&#13;
main river systems leads to a severe depletion of flows in some rivers. Several of the major drainage&#13;
systems have outlets into lakes or evaporation ponds whose capacity is exceeded by the drainage inflows.&#13;
2.9           Irrigated agriculture in Kazakstan is extensive in terms of the large fields that are&#13;
irrigated, the crop technologies applied and the type of farm machinery used. With energy now being&#13;
more realistically priced, such an extensive system that requires long and inefficient water delivery and&#13;
tractor hauls cannot survive competition from the world market and therefore has to change. To save&#13;
energy, different on-farm operations need to be combined, requiring different types of machinery and&#13;
equipment. Besides the fact that lands have been taken out of use, and the productivity is declining, the&#13;
most pressing problem in irrigated agriculture is the environmental consequence of poor water&#13;
management and excessive water use from surface water resources, which in the Syr Darya Basin has&#13;
contributed to the drying of the Aral Sea. On the other hand, re-use of (good) drainage water is seldom&#13;
practiced.&#13;
C. Institutional and Legal Framework3'&#13;
2.10          Organization of the Sector.  Several ministries, agencies, and organizations are&#13;
responsible for managing and administering the water resources and environmental policies effecting the&#13;
water and irrigation sectors in the Republic of Kazakstan. Since 1991, a number of organizational and&#13;
structural changes have taken place. The Ministry of Reclamation and Water Management was eliminated&#13;
in 1991 and replaced by the Committee on Water Resources. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological&#13;
Resources (MOEB) was established in 1992 as the successor to the State Committee on Ecology and&#13;
Nature Use and the Ministry of Forestry. Other changes may be expected in response to changing&#13;
demands on the Government. The major institutions of the Government of Kazakstan concerned with&#13;
the irrigation sector include:&#13;

Organization".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
*      the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) which is responsible for the development of&#13;
agricultural production. The monitoring of drainage, water logging, and soil&#13;
salinity conditions for the major irrigation projects in the five Southern Oblasts&#13;
is the responsibility of Hydrologic Amelioration Expeditions under the Minister&#13;
of Agriculture.&#13;
*      The Ministry of Geology and Protection of Underground Resources (MOG), the&#13;
key state authority in the field of geological prospecting and protection of the&#13;
underground resources.&#13;
*     Committee for Water Resources (CWR) which is responsible for maintaining and&#13;
operating the existing interfarm system for delivery of irrigation and rural&#13;
drinking water through regional and district water resource committees;&#13;
supervising eight river basin water management agencies; setting national policies&#13;
with respect to water quality and administering international river systems with&#13;
respect to water sharing.&#13;
*      Water Management Design Institutes. There are a number of design institutes&#13;
in Kazakstan with experience in the planning and design of irrigation and&#13;
drainage projects including Kazgiprovodkhoz, the former central water&#13;
management design institute. Most of the regional institutes have now been&#13;
placed under the administrative control of the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
*     Construction Organizations. There are general construction organizations known&#13;
as industrial unities (ICU) in each of the oblasts. Each region has also facilities&#13;
for producing prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and metal works.&#13;
*      The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB), which is a&#13;
planning, management, and monitoring agency mandated to promote the&#13;
protection and rational use of natural resources including land resources, soil,&#13;
water, forests, wildlife and fisheries.&#13;
*     Hydrometeorological Service (Hydromet), the principal authority in the field of&#13;
hydrometeorology and pollution monitoring.&#13;
*      The Ministry of Construction, Architecture and Housing, responsible for&#13;
enforcing construction norms and standards.&#13;
*     The Ministry of Health (MOH). The State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service&#13;
(SanEpid) under the MOH has the responsibility for determining, preventing and&#13;
mitigating the negative impacts of environmental pollution on human health.&#13;
*     The State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of Land Use (SCLR)&#13;
is entrusted with developing and implementing unified state policy on land&#13;
management and ensuring land reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
*      The Committee on Forestry (CF) is responsible for forest planning, development&#13;
and management.&#13;
*      The Ministry of Economy is responsible for preparing, approving, and&#13;
recommending technical projects for government funding.&#13;
2.11          Legal Framework. There are a number of environmental codes, common laws, decrees&#13;
and regulations. Some of these are relevant to environmental, water and agricultural sectors, including:&#13;
(i) the Law "On Environmental Protection" (June 1991), which establishes state ownership of the natural&#13;
resources, including, land, water, minerals, forests and wildlife; (ii) the "Water Code" (March 1993) for&#13;
the purpose of regulating water for domestic, industrial and agricultural use and to ensure meeting&#13;
environmental requirements; (iii) for a decree "On Land" (December 1995) which elaborates on land&#13;
ownership and classifies lands depending on the purpose of their use; (iv) the Law "On Land Reform in&#13;
Kazakstan" (June 1991) which states the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major&#13;
directions; and (v) the "Forestry Code" (January 1993), which clearly states that forests are the exclusive&#13;
property of the Republic, but provides for the different forms of forest ownership and establishes different&#13;
forest categories and liabilities for violation of the code and introduces economic instruments. Many of&#13;
these laws are now being amended and enforcement has been lacking, especially of the environmental&#13;
legislation and regulations.&#13;
D. Water Resources Planning and Management&#13;
2. 12         Management. Under the CWR there are nineteen regional committees in each of the&#13;
oblasts. Under the regional committees there are 96 district water resources committees. Regional level&#13;
activities and regional staff still receive their funds from the central government. All of the district level&#13;
operations are now self-supporting. In theory the concept is quite good. However, the process has been&#13;
introduced too suddenly and in practice funds at the district level are quite limited because of inability&#13;
and/or unwillingness of water users to pay water charges.&#13;
2.13          There are eight river basin organizations (BVOs) covering all areas of the Republic with&#13;
responsibility for allocating water to enterprises and farms. Each farm has fixed and registered water use&#13;
limits. During water short periods, water is prorated according to prescribed crop water requirement&#13;
norms. Higher value cash crops usually have first priority during water short periods. Water delivery&#13;
and operational plans are prepared each year. Any new area brought under irrigation requires special&#13;
registration even if the new area will be irrigated from water savings on the farm.&#13;
2.14          Government is also interested in privatizing O&amp;M of the inter-farm systems. MOA, with&#13;
the objective to halt the decline in system maintenance, has requested the Bank to assist with a feasibility&#13;
study on the establishment of a private irrigation company for a selected typical canal command; it is&#13;
intended that the company would be wholly owned by the water users (Para. 4.28).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
E. On-Farn Water Management&#13;
2.15          On-farm system operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the farm. Previously&#13;
O&amp;M funds were provided by the State. Because these funds are no longer available, maintenance of&#13;
on-farm facilities has been neglected. Externally, farm management represented the farm in negotiations&#13;
with the oblast administration regarding water allocations, investments and O&amp;M, and paid service fees,&#13;
with or without negotiation. Internally, water management and O&amp;M were generally organized on a&#13;
brigade level under the direction of the brigade's hydraulic technician, who worked in close collaboration&#13;
with other members of the brigade technical team.&#13;
2.16          A number of the farms that have been privatized have basically retained their original&#13;
management structure and are able to continue operations, including irrigation practices, according to&#13;
given rotation programs, using accumulated experience and expertise. Other privatized farms include a&#13;
number of small units (para. 3.5). Focus group discussions conducted as part of the project social&#13;
assessment, revealed a common pattern of relative isolation of the small units. Where restructuring has&#13;
involved the creation of small groups or small independent units, the members who leave the larger unit&#13;
are generally allocated land at the end of a watercourse, effectively marginalizing them from the large&#13;
unit, limiting their access to services and making them subject to decisions and actions taken upstream.&#13;
For such restructured farms, WUAs should be organized in order to provide an institutional bond between&#13;
all water users that transcends the remnants of the previous management structure and allows for&#13;
continuity in case of further restructuring. The consultant team working on project preparation is&#13;
developing pilot programs to create WUAs in some of the restructured farms to be included in the first&#13;
two years of the project in order to develop an appropriate WUA model for Kazakstan and to propose&#13;
an efficient, effective program to organize WUAs.&#13;
F. Financial Issues&#13;
2.17          Water pricing was introduced in 1992. The Government is required to deliver water and&#13;
end users are expected to pay. Because water is considered to be State property, water charges are for&#13;
services associated with water delivery and supply. Farms are assessed on the basis of scheduled&#13;
deliveries, with rates based on recovery of O&amp;M costs. Farms are billed based on a volumetric&#13;
measurement of water used. The CWR sets prices for irrigation water. Setting and collection of water&#13;
charges for irrigation is done at the District level. Water for industrial use is usually controlled by City&#13;
Water Channel Authorities. Cost for drinking and industrial water use is determined at the Republic level.&#13;
Each industry has its own prices. All prices must be approved by the State Monopoly Committee.&#13;
2.18          In 1994 of the 17,500 mcm of water allocated for irrigation, 92 percent was used, but&#13;
only 47 percent (1,195 million tenge) of the water fees were collected. For drinking water only 29&#13;
percent (143 million tenge) of the fees were collected.&#13;
2.19          For FY 1995 the Committee on Water Resources was allocated 24 million tenge out of&#13;
the national budget of 175,400 million tenge ( 0.014 percent). Only 40 percent of this money was made&#13;
available. This budget is required to support Republic staff, oblast staff, BVO office staff, reservoir&#13;
operations and major river diversion structures. District level operations and interfarm systems are to&#13;
be covered by user fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.20          There are few incentives to reduce water use at this time. However, if an enterprise/farm&#13;
exceeds its allocated water use, MOEB can fine the enterprise up to 5 times the cost of the amount water&#13;
used above the allocation.&#13;
2.21          The existence of a water charge system to recover O&amp;M costs for the inter-farm system&#13;
will enhance the potential for recovery of the costs for rehabilitating the inter-farm systems.&#13;
Unfortunately, the current capacity for beneficiaries to pay for water is limited. As market conditions&#13;
normalize and farms begin to realize full market value for their crops, this situation should improve.&#13;
However, during the transition period, some sort of government support program may be required.&#13;
There is a proposal to use taxation to cover water service charges now pending with the government.&#13;
G. Environmental Sector Issues&#13;
2.22          Current environmental problems and degradation of natural resources in Kazakstan stem&#13;
mainly from past economic policies and practices in the former Soviet Union (FSU) that promoted&#13;
quantitative targets set for the economy of the whole country and its different sectors by central planning&#13;
authorities. These policies were accompanied by pricing policies under which natural resources were&#13;
undervalued and the environment as a whole was treated as a free good, both by productive sectors and&#13;
by consumers. In parallel, the lack of sound and realistic environmental policies, legislation, standards&#13;
and management systems capable of enforcing those regulations and standards, has led over the years to&#13;
over-use of natural resources and their degradation, as well as to pollution levels with increasingly&#13;
adverse effects for public health.&#13;
2.23          The underlying challenge facing Kazakstan in all aspects of environmentally sustainable&#13;
development is the need to strengthen substantially the environmental institutions, and the related legal&#13;
framework, so that they can undertake their mandated tasks. Environmental problems in the sector are&#13;
caused in general by the following: outdated water and land management policies and practices and lack&#13;
of integrated pest management (IPM); inadequate technical design, poor construction, operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of irrigation and drainage systems; institutional deficiencies, including lack of&#13;
economic and environmental criteria in project selection and development; insufficient staff with&#13;
experience both in sectoral and environmental agencies; financial constraints preventing adequate O&amp;M&#13;
of environmental monitoring systems and inadequate staffing to tackle sectoral environmental problems.&#13;
2.24          The following problems have been identified as posing constraints on environmentally&#13;
sustainable agricultural development in Kazakstan: (i) surface and underground water scarcity and uneven&#13;
seasonal and territorial distribution accompanied by increasing water losses in irrigated agriculture; (ii)&#13;
surface and underground water pollution by agriculture, including run-off due to past over-application&#13;
of agro-chemicals; (iii) soil fertility depletion due to poor agricultural practices; (iv) increasing wind and&#13;
water soil erosion due to reduction of afforestation efforts; (v) waterlogging and salinization of soils due&#13;
to poor design and construction, reduction in O&amp;M and in some cases non-operation of irrigation and&#13;
drainage systems; (vi) inadequate enviromnental standards and policies, that are in some cases&#13;
incompatible with international norms, which in turn are not appropriately implemented, enforced or&#13;
monitored due to ineffective environmental management and monitoring systems; and (vii) lack of&#13;
capacity to develop and implement projects in an environmentally sustainable fashion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
H. Bank Environmental and Water Strategy in Kazakstan&#13;
2.25          A key element of the Bank's overall strategy for agriculture in Kazakstan seeks to address&#13;
environmental concerns, including public sector management capacity in environmental agencies. The&#13;
Bank's focus is on: (a) preventive measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts, through the use of&#13;
policy and regulatory measures, environrnental assessments (EAs), environmental planning and economic&#13;
instruments; and (b) curative measures to address existing problems of water and soil pollution in a cost&#13;
effective manner.&#13;
2.26          The macro-economic and policy reforms currently underway in the country are likely to&#13;
result in significant environmental benefits, particularly as inefficient and pollution intensive facilities are&#13;
closed or replaced with cleaner technologies, and price reform leads to more rational and efficient land,&#13;
water, and agro-chemical inputs use. These reform measures will need to be complemented by appropriate&#13;
environmental policies and priorities, and an effective environmental institutional and management&#13;
framework, including environmental standards, monitoring, and economic incentives systems. Once&#13;
appropriate norms and standards are established, adherence should be adequately enforced and monitored.&#13;
This will require functional streamlining of the respective environmental agencies and greater&#13;
transparency of their operation as well as increased public participation.&#13;
2.27          While Kazakstan has not yet developed a comprehensive water resources development&#13;
strategy and management plans, initial steps are being taken by Government within the context of the&#13;
Bank-supported Aral Sea Basin Program, which involves activities benefitting the Syr Darya basin in&#13;
Kazakstan, including inter alia, water resources management and environmental studies, improving&#13;
hydrometeorological services, data bases, information services, and water quality management; and&#13;
undertaking wetland restoration and capacity building; a preliminary development plan for the Syr Darya&#13;
basin in Kazakstan has recently been completed under Program 4.4.4' In addition, a number of pilot&#13;
projects are currently being proposed for implementation as part of Program 3.1 b-', with the objective&#13;
of testing solutions for water management and salinity problems. The proposed project is complementary&#13;
to the Aral Sea Program as it would provide an opportunity to identify and demonstrate the use of "good&#13;
practices" in irrigation and drainage, including water conservation and environmental management, which&#13;
could be applied elsewhere in the Aral Sea Basin. The project's environmental sub-component would also&#13;
complement specific assistance being provided to the MOEB under the Technical Assistance Loan, which&#13;
supports in particular the ministry's legislative, monitoring and enforcement capabilities.&#13;
2.28          Kazakstan has not yet developed a comprehensive forest sector development strategy and&#13;
management plans through initial steps have been undertaken in this direction through the adoption of a&#13;
new "Forestry Code" and supporting implementation regulations. The project's environmental mitigation&#13;
measures would include the planting of trees in shelter belts along project area boundaries to retard soil&#13;
loss and erosion, and improve environmental conditions in the project area.&#13;
2.29          The proposed project has been prepared in a manner consistent with the recommendations&#13;
under the Bank Water Resources Management Policy and the Forest Sector.  It will support:&#13;
(a) strengthening of sector and media institutions involved in environmental management; (b) developing&#13;
4/     Syr Darya Control and Delta Development Project&#13;
5/     Water Quality Management - Agricultural Water Quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
EA capacities; (c) re-enforcing agro-meteorological, water and soil quality monitoring systems and data&#13;
management; (d) mitigation of existing waterlogging and salinity problems; (e) afforestation efforts to&#13;
slow soil and wind erosion and degradation of watersheds; and (f) increasing awareness of the role of&#13;
trees in retaining soil fertility and averting degradation.&#13;
I. Ten and Five Year Irrigation Investment Plans&#13;
2.30          In 1991, "An Integrated Program for the Development of Land Reclamation" (IPLR,&#13;
Kazgiprovodkhoz, 1991) was completed and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The study identified&#13;
775,000 ha in 19 oblasts where technical irrigation and reclamation improvements were needed. A Ten-&#13;
Year Indicative Plan (Harza, Nippon Koei, Kazgiprovodkhoz) was prepared by reviewing and screening&#13;
the Projects identified in the IPLR. Factors considered in screening projects were economic merit;&#13;
political factors such as project distribution among oblasts; projects with an identified risk of immediate&#13;
failure; environmental impact; improved technology; status or potential for privatization; potential for&#13;
early implementation with emphasis on projects with potential for quick response; and availability of&#13;
feasibility studies and designs.&#13;
2.31          The Ten-Year Plan identified 58 main projects, with 141 irrigation and drainage&#13;
reconstruction sub-projects covering over 150,000 ha with an estimated cost of US$651 million.&#13;
Comprehensive reconstruction of irrigation and drainage was proposed on 74,600 ha.  Drainage&#13;
improvements were proposed on 95,500 ha, including 18,500 ha of new  drainage.  Irrigation&#13;
improvements were proposed on 62,100 ha. It was estimated that implementation of the Plan would result&#13;
in an increase in US$63 million in annual net farm income from crop production.&#13;
2.32          The projects in the Ten-Year Plan were further evaluated to select a set of projects for&#13;
possible implementation during the first five years. Feasibility studies were carried out on 34 sub-projects&#13;
covering 62,000 ha with an estimated cost of US$140 million. From this list of 34 sub-projects, 22 sub-&#13;
projects in 11 oblasts with a total area of 40,000 ha have been proposed for implementation under the&#13;
Kazakstan Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project. The actual number of projects selected for&#13;
implementation during the first five years will be limited by the availability of international loan funds&#13;
and the availability of the government's budget to finance local costs. Since the Project has been&#13;
developed as a program, it will be possible to substitute sub-projects if necessary or add sub-projects as&#13;
additional funds become available.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. General&#13;
3.1            The sub-project areas are located throughout Kazakstan in eleven of the nineteen oblasts&#13;
and cover about 30,000 ha. Most of the work is concentrated in the five Southern oblasts of Almaty,&#13;
South Kazakstan, Taldy-Korgan, Kzyl Orda and Zhambyl.  (IBRD Map 27736).  A summary of&#13;
conditions in the project areas is presented in Annex D.&#13;
B. Agriculture&#13;
3.2            Irrigated farms were almost all large State or Collective farms with irrigation and farm&#13;
operation facilities scaled to large fields and operated by specialists. Compared with western large farms,&#13;
the production system is mostly outdated in terms of production technologies, type of farm machinery&#13;
and management principles. Except for grains, total planted area has declined since 1990, because of the&#13;
deterioration of irrigation and drainage facilities and the shortage of financing for farm production inputs&#13;
and new machinery (Table 3.1).&#13;

3.3           In terms of crop production, potatoes, vegetables and fodder crops are grown in all&#13;
oblasts with regular irrigation, of which Almaty, Taldy Korgan and Zhambyl are the main producers.&#13;
These three oblasts are also the main producers of sugarbeet. Cotton can only be grown in South-&#13;
Kazakstan, while maize is mainly grown in the four oblasts of Almaty, Taldy Korgan, Zhambyl and Kzyl-&#13;
Orda. Kzyl-Orda is also the main oblast for rice production and winter cereals. Since the bulk of cereals&#13;
is grown in the northern "Virgin Lands" under rainfed conditions, it is questionable whether wheat and&#13;
barley should be grown under irrigation in Kzyl-Orda as well. The problem, however, has been the&#13;
absence of a functional marketing and distribution system in the country, which encourage local&#13;

commnodities.&#13;
3.4            Yields of most crops in 1993 were 20 percent or more below their level in 1990. The low&#13;
yields are a consequence of economic disruption of agricultural production resulting in lack of spare parts&#13;
and (appropriate) machinery, lack of funds to purchase inputs, late payments by the State for past&#13;
purchases, reduced directed credit from the State with, no alternative sources of credit, distorted price&#13;
relationships between non subsidized production inputs and controlled prices received for crops and&#13;
livestock.&#13;

C. Privatization&#13;
3.5            As part of the social assessment conducted for this project (see Annex A), managers of&#13;
30 of the farms identified for participation in the project were interviewed regarding the privatization&#13;
status of the farms. Twenty-two of the farms had already been privatized by the end of June 1995, and&#13;
seven more were privatized by the end of the calendar year. One agricultural research farm, is scheduled&#13;
to remain under State control, and may therefore be excluded from the project. The current or proposed&#13;
new structures are as follows: eight joint stock companies; seven collective enterprises; six farmers&#13;
associations; three comrade associations; and four private enterprises. Nineteen of the 30 farms have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
been restructured - split up into smaller units - to some degree. Most of those have a large unit and a&#13;
number of small units, individual family farms or small cooperative units; a few have been divided into&#13;
many small units, primarily in South Kazakstan. All of those that privatized in 1994 or before have&#13;
restructured somewhat; several of which seem to be undergoing an annual process of redefining both&#13;
land divisions and management structure. In sum, the situation is very fluid, for the most part tending&#13;
toward increased restructuring.&#13;
3.6           Farm restructuring might be expected to affect the project in at least two ways: it could&#13;
leave a management void that affects water management, and thus effective use of the investment; and/or&#13;
restructuring would require additional investment to modify the irrigation system to accommodate smaller&#13;
turnout areas. Although all of the farms still maintain an umbrella management entity that could continue&#13;
to be responsible for operation and maintenance of the on-farm works, it is clear that small break-away&#13;
units are given low priority by farm management (para. 2.16). Water User Associations can fill this&#13;
management void. Restructuring is not expected to require additional on-farm investments, as the design&#13;
of existing systems appears to be flexible enough, and turnout areas are small enough to accommodate&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
D. Socio-Economic Status&#13;
3.7           The people on the farms proposed for the project include a broad cross-section of Kazak&#13;
rural people whose situation mirrors the general economic situation in the country. They are troubled&#13;
by the collapse of the economy, reflected in their failure to receive wages; they understand the dissolution&#13;
of old trading arrangements, which results in the lack of spare parts for machinery and other shortages;&#13;
and they suffer from the absence of markets in a nascent market economy. Farms that grow specialized&#13;
crops, such as onions or vegetables near urban centers are faring well because they already have&#13;
established private market ties that they can continue to develop. Grain farms are in a somewhat more&#13;
precarious situation since state domination of the grain trade has subsided more slowly which has retarded&#13;
the emergence of private marketing channels. However, 1995 may have marked a turn around in the&#13;
development of a multi-channel market system, as state involvement in marketing was dramatically&#13;
reduced and active private trade quickly began to emerge.  In either case, however, an important&#13;
challenge of privatization is for farms to balance the need to be financially viable with the need to protect&#13;
soil resources by adhering to the crop rotation system developed for each farm and religiously maintained&#13;
until the present.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.1           Substantial investments were made during the Soviet era in the irrigation and drainage&#13;
infrastructure, dramatically expanding irrigated area. These systems have deteriorated due in part to poor&#13;
design and construction, but also to inadequate maintenance and failure to complete required drainage&#13;
systems. This deterioration has increasingly led to water logging and salinity, and reduced yields. The&#13;
situation has been exacerbated by environmental problems, including inefficient water management, water&#13;
pollution and declining soil fertility. Current environmental standards and policies are inadequate and the&#13;
environmental management systems are not able to control the situation.&#13;
4.2           In 1991, an Integrated Program for the Development of Land Reclamation (IPLR) was&#13;
completed and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The program identified 775,000 ha in 1,300&#13;
projects located in 19 oblasts where irrigation and drainage improvements were needed. In October 1992,&#13;
a Bank identification mission visited Kazakstan and the Government expressed interest in Bank financing&#13;
for this program. Project preparation was undertaken from January 1994 through June 1995 with support&#13;
of a Japanese PHRD Grant. Ten and Five Year Investment Plans were prepared. Project preparation was&#13;
continued in September 1995 under a "bridging operation" with financing from an advance of the Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF).&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Rationale for Bank's Involvement&#13;
4.3           The rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure and improving its&#13;
management, as well as enhancing the environment are key elements in the Bank's strategy to promote&#13;
sustainable irrigated agriculture (paras. 1.13 and 2.29). The project's main objectives would be to: (i)&#13;
promote sustainable irrigated agricultural production through irrigation and drainage rehabilitation,&#13;
improved water management, and better operation and maintenance; (ii) introduce improved agricultural&#13;
practices and farmers' information services; and (iii) strengthen irrigation and environmental agencies.&#13;
4.4           More specifically, the Bank's involvement in the project would: (i) include economic and&#13;
environmental selection criteria in long term irrigation investment planning; (ii) introduce higher technical&#13;
standards and new technologies/procedures in planning, design, construction (particularly quality control),&#13;
environmental protection and procurement; (iii) start, as a pilot program, farmers' participatory training&#13;
and farmers' information services to provide information on general farm management, improved&#13;
production packages, and better water management; (iv) support privatization by establishing eligibility&#13;
criteria for participating farms and improving the skill levels of recently established and prospective&#13;
independent farms; (v) strengthen MOA's project implementation capacity and strengthen MOA's,&#13;
MOEB's and other concerned agencies' environmental, technical and management capacity; (vi) expose&#13;
the local design institutes and the local construction industry to new technologies and better practices; (vii)&#13;
assist in the establishment of Water Users Associations (WUAs) for O&amp;M within the newly privatized&#13;
farms; (viii) introduce farmers' participation in project design and implementation; and (ix) improve&#13;
O&amp;M of the inter-farm systems through increased collection of water charges.&#13;
C. Project Selection Criteria&#13;
4.5           The criteria agreed with MOA for the inclusion of sub-projects in the investment program&#13;
are shown in Annex F. Most importantly, the sub-projects would only take place on the privatized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
successors to state farms and would aim at rehabilitating presently irrigated areas and/or land previously&#13;
irrigated but now abandoned. The feasibility study would be undertaken for each sub-project to establish&#13;
its economic and financial viability (economic and financial rate of returns should exceed 12 percent).&#13;
Participating farms would sign appropriate letters of agreement with MOA to repay investment costs&#13;
through a per hectare cost recovery fee.&#13;
D. Main Components&#13;
4.6           The project would support a six year irrigation and drainage investment program. It has&#13;
been appraised on the basis of feasibility studies for about 34 sub-projects prepared by MOA with the&#13;
assistance of foreign and local consultants. Out of these 34 sub-projects, a core program of nine sub-&#13;
projects has been identified for construction starts in Year One (1996/1997) and Two (1997/1998) of the&#13;
implementation program. Two other sub-projects (Saryozenski and Kranaya Polyana) have only recently&#13;
been proposed for Year Two implementation. These two sub-projects, together with the sub-projects to&#13;
be selected for Year Three from a list of 13 "reserve projects" or from other potential sub-projects, would&#13;
still need to be prepared and approved by the Bank for implementation. Main components of the project&#13;
would be:&#13;
(a)    Improving reliability and efficiency of irrigation water use, involving irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation and installation of sprinkler systems; and reducing waterlogging&#13;
and salinity, involving rehabilitation of collector drains and on- farm drainage&#13;
improvements; the project works would include predominantly on-farm system&#13;
rehabilitation (about 30,000 ha) as well as selected improvements in inter-farm&#13;
irrigation and drainage;&#13;
(b)    Promoting agricultural development of privatized farms through a pilot operation&#13;
aimed at providing farmers' training, demonstrations and information services;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)    Institution building, including: (i) support for the Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU) in the MOA; and (ii) strengthening the environmental and monitoring&#13;
capabilities of the MOA, the MOEB and other concerned agencies; undertaking&#13;
a study of feasibility of transferring of inter-farm irrigation management from the&#13;
public sector to the water users.&#13;
E. Detailed Features&#13;
Component 1: Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems (Base Cost US$ 78.3 million)#'&#13;
4.7           General. The rehabilitation works would be undertaken in three groups of sub-projects,&#13;
averaging about 10,000 ha of on-farm systems and/or inter-farm irrigation and drainage systems.&#13;
Individual sub-projects may involve either (i) Comprehensive Reconstruction of Irrigation Systems&#13;
(CROIS), including irrigation and drainage; (ii) reconstruction of on-farm drainage only; or (iii) either&#13;
related or self-standing inter-farm irrigation or drainage improvements. On-farm irrigation may include&#13;
6/     For details see Annex G, "Project Summary Table"; Annex H, "Summary Project Works': and Annex 1, "Description of Sub-&#13;
Projects for Years One and Two."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
either surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation. On-farm drainage works consist of either surface, tile&#13;
or vertical drainage.&#13;
4.8            Year One (1996/97). The 6 sub-projects identified for implementation starts in Year One&#13;
comprise 10 km of inter-farm canals; 6,500 ha of on-farm irrigation improvements and 10,300 ha of on-&#13;
farm drainage, including 1,400 of tile drainage and about 7,800 ha of vertical drainage. (base cost about&#13;
US$26 Million).&#13;
4.9            Year Two (1997/98). The 3 sub-projects currently under preparation for implementation&#13;
starts in Year Two comprise 2,100 ha of on-farm irrigation improvements and 5,500 ha of on-farm&#13;
drainage improvements, including 4,900 ha of tile drainage and 600 ha of vertical drainage. (base cost&#13;
about US$17 Million).7'&#13;
4.10           Year Three (1998/1999). Sub-projects to start in Year Three would be selected from the&#13;
list of 13 "reserve projects" or, if needed, from among other potential sub-projects (base costs about&#13;
US$26 million).&#13;
4.11          On-farm irrigation systems. Two basic types of on-farm irrigation projects are being&#13;
proposed; those to be rehabilitated as surface furrow systems; and those to be reconstructed as pivot&#13;
sprinkler irrigation systems. The surface systems generally involve replacing the open earth canal&#13;
delivery system with a lined or closed pipe system, providing outlets down to 15 ha farm blocks. The&#13;
surface systems are, in most cases, designed for use with movable hose. Major elements of the sprinkler&#13;
systems include replacement of the delivery  system  with a closed pipe distribution system, and&#13;
installation of a mobile or stationary pump station where required. The center pivot system would service&#13;
an average of 50 ha. The works include provision of slide gates, pipe valves, water meters in pipes,&#13;
broad-crested long measuring flumes, pressure relief regulation valves, and check valves.  Other&#13;
infrastructure reconstruction such as roads and power lines are provided as needed. Demonstrations in&#13;
water management (para. 4.18) would contribute to improving on-farm water use efficiencies.&#13;
4.12            An economic and technical evaluation was carried out for each irrigation reconstruction&#13;
project to determine irrigation type. In general sprinkler irrigation was proposed where sub-surface&#13;
closed drainage was required, land leveling was needed, in water short areas, and in sub-projects where&#13;
sprinkler systems are currently used.  The farms will make the final choice regarding the type of&#13;
sprinkler system that will be purchased for their farm.&#13;
4.13           On-farm drainage systems. In general on-farm sub-surface drainage will be provided for&#13;
areas where the water table is less than 2 meters from the surface. Drain depth will be set at 2 m and&#13;
plastic pipe will be used for all sub-surface drains. Vertical drainage was selected for use in Maktara&#13;
District (Golodnya Steppe) and involves a total of 70 drainage wells (about 7,800 ha).&#13;
4.14          One of the most critical components of a successful drainage scheme is a proper outlet.&#13;
Special attention was given to the question of drain outlets during the preparation of the feasibility&#13;
designs. The GOK has a strict policy of limiting the discharge of drainage water into a receiving body&#13;
that has a higher water quality than the discharging flow. A number of alternative procedures have been&#13;
used in the past to conform to this regulation. Many drainage systems have had their flows diverted into&#13;
specially constructed evaporation ponds or are conveyed large distances to natural depressions or salted&#13;

phase. Special water balance and water quality studies will be required for several of the larger projects.&#13;
Component 2: Promoting Agricultural Development on Privatized Farms&#13;
(Base Cost US$1.9 million)8'&#13;
4.15           Pilots for Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services. Most members&#13;
of the project farms, at least at this time, appear to prefer to be part of a functional group within their&#13;
large farm unit and work under the aegis of the former State/Collective Farm management and specialists,&#13;
rather than to take the risk of being the owner of a smaller private farm. These functional groups may&#13;
be a former production brigade of 60 - 80 people, working on 450 to 500 ha, or smaller family groups&#13;
or teams. The groups are responsible for either on-farm water management, crop production or one of&#13;
the farm services, such as water delivery, maintaining a pool of farm machinery or dairy production.&#13;
However, the overall responsibility for water management and services still remains with centralized&#13;
farms management and specialists.&#13;
4. 16         The main reasons for the reluctance of the shareholders to restructure the larger farms&#13;
into smaller units include: (i) lack of overall farm management skills; (ii) lack of operating capital and&#13;
access to agricultural credit; (iii) poorly developed marketing and input supply mechanisms; and (iv)&#13;
limited availability of inputs, spare parts, and equipment. The project will address the first issue through&#13;
a pilot operation to capitalize on the potential for increased agricultural production created by the&#13;
investments in irrigation and drainage. The pilot focuses on informing farmers on commercial farm&#13;
management principles, the use of more efficient production and water management practices and options&#13;
for privatization.&#13;
4.17           Effective research, extension and agricultural information services do not exist for private&#13;
farmers in Kazakstan. Agricultural training takes place in the higher educational centers at universities&#13;
while specialist advice, mainly in the form of directives, usually comes from agricultural research&#13;
institutes. Therefore, a number of practical, client-oriented, short participatory training courses or&#13;
workshops will be prepared and conducted under the project at selected project farms or training centers&#13;
for government officials, farm managers and directors, production specialists and farmers' groups and&#13;
individual private farmers. Topics for training will include modern farm and business management&#13;
practices, new crop production technologies, improved on-farm water management, marketing and&#13;
processing of produce, and environmental topics.&#13;
4.18          Together with the training, relevant demonstrations on improved on-farm  water&#13;
management (types of irrigation and drainage) and new crop production technologies will be conducted&#13;
to show farm managers and (future) farmers how to increase efficiency of applied inputs, the use of more&#13;
efficient farm machinery and tractors and how to intensify crop production.&#13;
4. 19         To further support the participating farms and other irrigated farms not included in the&#13;
project, a "Farmers' Information Services Desk" will be established in MOA to provide technical&#13;
pamphlets, videos and other materials on critical agricultural issues related to farm management,&#13;
production and marketing. Most information will be disseminated in Russian and Kazak through the&#13;
existing TV and Radio channels by MOA's Press Center and through two "Farmers' Weekly" papers.&#13;

4.20          Farm Restructuring. The project will support the privatization process and promote&#13;
restructuring, as appropriate and desired by farmers, in four principal ways: by developing and refining&#13;
a strong participatory process in design and implementation, the project will contribute to the&#13;
empowerment of farm members; by providing access to information and management skills, it will&#13;
encourage entrepreneurial farmers to take the risks associated with creating and managing new farm units;&#13;
by creating Water User Associations in conjunction with restructuring, it will provide an institutional&#13;
mechanism to operate and maintain the system and assure equitable access to water by all farmers; finally,&#13;
by discouraging concentrated ownership of farms, the project will help preserve the universe of choice&#13;
during this difficult transition period. Each of these elements is discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
4.21          The project incorporates a multi-step  consultation  process in  the design  and&#13;
implementation of sub-projects. This will engage both farmers and managers in making decisions and&#13;
assuming responsibility for farm assets to be affected by the project. This iterative consultation process&#13;
will broaden the prevailing concept of farm management and will contribute significantly, although&#13;
somewhat indirectly, to making further steps in the privatization process more open, more transparent,&#13;
and more informed.&#13;
4.22           One reason that farmers are still reluctant to break away from new collective or corporate&#13;
farms is a lack of management skills that would enable them to operate new farms. Management of new&#13;
restructured units is important for the project, as it will affect the potential for increasing agricultural&#13;
production that is created by the project. The project will develop a number of practical training courses&#13;
on production and management issues, demonstrations of improved water management and production&#13;
technologies and create broader information dissemination mechanisms (see paras. 4.17 - 4.19). This&#13;
management training component will support privatization very concretely by assisting new family and&#13;
small cooperative farms to establish themselves, as well as prompt larger units to consider restructuring.&#13;
4.23          As farms restructure, water user associations will be created to fill institutional gaps that&#13;
give break-away units inadequate access to water. Appropriate models for Kazakstan will be developed&#13;
under the PPF that build on and strengthen existing community bonds. The project will then launch pilot&#13;
efforts on farms already restructured to test and refine the models. Depending on the outcome of a pilot&#13;
effort to create an autonomous water district that is responsible for water management from the diversion&#13;
to the farmgate, the project may promote widespread adoption of this concept as a way of decentralizing&#13;
authority and responsibly for water resource management to an operational level.&#13;
4.24          On some farms, farm managers and technicians are attempting to acquire land use right&#13;
certificates from farm members to create large commercial farm units, encompassing either a whole&#13;
former state farm or the equivalent of a brigade unit. Currently, other farm members are vulnerable to&#13;
pressure to cede their use rights due to great uncertainties. To preserve the future choices of vulnerable&#13;
farmers, the project will exclude farms that restrict the ability of farm members to cede their land share&#13;
from the principal unit and start new farm units. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that&#13;
the eligibility criteria for participation in the project would require that the bylaws of each farm&#13;
participating in the project would guarantee the right of individuals and groups to withdraw their shares&#13;
from the collective or corporate entity and establish their own independent farms.&#13;
&#13;

Component 3: Institution Building (Base Cost US$5.0 million)9'&#13;
4.25           Support for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) (Base Cost US$ 2.2 million). The&#13;
project would upgrade the institutional capacity of the MOA in planning, preparing, executing and&#13;
monitoring an irrigation and drainage investment program. For that purpose, a PIU was established in&#13;
July 1995, under the direct supervision of the Minister of Agriculture. PIU staff, including Resident&#13;
Engineers for construction supervision, would be recruited on a competitive basis and financed (base cost&#13;
US$0.9 million) under the project.&#13;
4.26          The PIU would contract management and engineering consultants to (i) assist and train&#13;
PIU staff in project planning, management, monitoring, procurement and financial management; (ii) take&#13;
responsibility for updating/preparing feasibility studies, preparing Environmental Impact Assessments&#13;
(EIAs), undertaking field surveys and designs, preparing bidding documents; and (iii) assist PIU with&#13;
farmers' participation, establishing WUAs and construction supervision.  It is expected that the&#13;
management and engineering consultants will work with national design institutes as partner(s) in a joint&#13;
venture or as sub-contractors. The main consultant would provide training to staff of the local design&#13;
institutes in, inter alia,  construction supervision and quality control. These arrangements would&#13;
strengthen the local consulting industry, as well as introduce it to better engineering standards and&#13;
business practices. It is expected that the consultants' contract would involve some 175 person-months&#13;
of expatriate staff and about 5,000 person-months of local experts and support staff. During Negotiations&#13;
it was agreed that the need for further consulting services would be examined during the mid-term review&#13;
(para. 5.30) and funds would be reallocated if such a need would arise.&#13;
4.27          Strengthening Environmental Capacity (Base Cost US$2.6 million)'.  This sub-&#13;
component would include:&#13;
(a)    Institutional Development and Training (Cost US$855,000), involving:&#13;
a. I    Institutional Development (Cost US$250,000), including preparation of&#13;
an improved Environmental Assessment (EA) regulatory framework for&#13;
irrigation/drainage development; preparation of an EIA manual for&#13;
irrigation/drainage projects; and building environmental capacity in MOA&#13;
through the creation of an Environmental Unit.&#13;
a.2    EIA  Preparation and State Ecological  Expertise  (SEE) Review&#13;
(US$150,000), including preparation of remaining project specific ElAs&#13;
and SEE Review as required by national environmental legislation and&#13;
governmental regulations.&#13;
a.3    Training (US$370,000) for managers, irrigation/drainage engineers,&#13;
environmental staff, and farmers. A supporting information program&#13;
would be developed that may include television spots, preparation of&#13;
brochures, guides, leaflets, bulletins, video and radio programs, etc.&#13;
9!     Excluding costs for engineering and construction supervision, which are included in Component 1.&#13;

- 23 -&#13;
a.4    An EA Harmonization Seminar (Cost US$85,000) to reconcile differences&#13;
in Bank and Kazak EA requirements and procedures and foster EA&#13;
preparation for project processing in various sectors;&#13;
(b)    Strengthening  Water/Soil Quality,  Monitoring  and  Pollution  Control,&#13;
Agro-meteorological Programu and Provision of Equipment and Materials (Cost&#13;
US$970,000), including provision of field and laboratory monitoring equipment,&#13;
computers for data processing and management, vehicles, office equipment, spare&#13;
parts and chemicals for laboratory analysis; monitoring of soil contamination,&#13;
drainage, surface and ground water quality, water table and salinity;&#13;
strengthening existing agro-meteorological data collection systems; measuring&#13;
water losses in irrigation/drainage systems; and supporting monitoring of&#13;
pesticide residues and quality control of agricultural inputs/outputs;&#13;
(c)    Special Environmental Studies (US$150,000), including  development of&#13;
cost-effective methods to prevent salinity and water-logging, methods for the&#13;
reclamation of saline soil or introduction of alternative land use; and&#13;
(d)    Developing and Implementing Mitigation Plans (US$625,000), including a pilot&#13;
project to clean drainage water from agro-chemical residues; and afforestation&#13;
within the boundaries of the sub-project areas.&#13;
4.28          Study of the Feasibility of Privatizing Irrigation Management for a Typical Canal&#13;
Command Area (US$230,000). Funds would be provided under the loan for a study to examine the&#13;
feasibility of establishing a private irrigation company for the area served by the Tashatkul canal&#13;
(approximately 40,000 ha) in Dzambul Oblast. MOA is concerned about the sustainability of the inter-&#13;
farm systems because of insufficient funding of O&amp;M and sees user participation and privatization as&#13;
a means to improve system O&amp;M. It is envisaged that the company would be owned by the water users,&#13;
be fully responsible for operation and maintenance and financially self-sufficient. The study would define&#13;
the desired services to be provided by the company, the costs for providing these services, financial&#13;
arrangements and the process of establishing the company and transferring to it management of the&#13;
system. The study would specifically consider issues of jurisdiction, ownership, organizational structure&#13;
of the new management, the need for technological improvements in operation and maintenance to&#13;
facilitate the transfer process, and training needs, among others.&#13;
F. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.29          The project is to be implemented over a period of six years.  A summary of the&#13;
implementation schedule is shown in Annex L. The IDIP has been designed as an irrigation development&#13;
program. Individual sub-projects can be added or removed from the program based on the willingness&#13;
of beneficiaries to participate, ability of beneficiaries to pay for the on-farm reconstruction costs, and&#13;
economic viability, technical feasibility, and environmental acceptability of each sub-project.&#13;
Construction periods for individual sub-projects are expected to be about two to three years, depending&#13;
upon the size of the project.&#13;

G. Project Costs&#13;
4.30             The proposed project is estimated to cost about US$118 million. This estimate is based&#13;
on December 1995 prices, but with the addition of taxes and physical and price contingencies. The&#13;
foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$49 million or about 42 percent of total project cost.&#13;
Physical contingencies were assumed at 10 percent of the investment costs. Price contingency estimates&#13;
assume an increase in local currency costs of 15 per cent per annum starting in 1997 (based on expected&#13;
local inflation) and in foreign exchange of 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.7 percent for 1997. 2.5 percent for&#13;
1998, 2.5 percent for 1999, 2.6 percent for 2000, and 2.7 percent for 2001 and 2002. Physical and price&#13;
contingencies combined comprise 32 percent of the project base cost. Import duties, and value added tax&#13;
amount to about 17 percent of the base cost.'L' The costs for on-farm irrigation works with surface&#13;
irrigation are about US$1,400/ha, and with sprinkler irrigation US$ 2,600/ha. The costs for horizontal&#13;
sub-surface drainage are about US$1,440/ha, and for vertical drainage US$600/ha. Project costs are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1 and details are presented in Annex M.&#13;

H. Financing Plan&#13;
4.31             A loan of US$80 million equivalent to the Republic of Kazakstan is proposed, to finance&#13;
80 percent of total costs net of taxes. This would cover 100 percent of foreign costs and 61 percent of&#13;
local costs net of taxes and duties. The Borrower would contribute about US$20 million equivalent or&#13;
about 20 percent of total project cost (net of taxes). The costs of on-farm rehabilitation works would&#13;
eventually be repaid by participating farms through a cost recovery fee (para. 5.23). In August 1995,&#13;
the Bank approved an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF); this advance will be repaid&#13;
under the loan. The financing plan for the project is presented in Table 4.2.&#13;
H/      The treatment of taxes in the cost tables is based on existing tax legislation. The Bank has just leamt that revisions to the legislation&#13;
are being proposed so that project costs financed by multi-lateral lenders including the World Hank will be exempt from custom duties&#13;
and VAT taxes.&#13;

4.32          Counterpart Funds.  Project implementation according to plan requires the timely&#13;
availability of budgetary resources to finance local costs.  Assurances were obtained during loan&#13;
negotiations that. (i) the Government would introduce, beginning in FY97, a line item in the annual draft&#13;
budget for the project until its completion, for the sole use of the project, and in an amount to be agreed&#13;
with the Bank; (ii) Government would provide sufficient funds in its annual budgets to cover routine&#13;
environmental monitoring activities by MOA, MOEB, MOG, Hydromet, and SANEPID in the sub-project&#13;
areas; and (iii) an annual review would be undertaken by the Government and the Bank of Government's&#13;
investment program in irrigation to assure that only priority investments are undertaken and that planned&#13;
investments would not threaten counterpart funding levels for the proposed project.&#13;
I. Procurement&#13;
4.33          Procurement of goods and works would follow the "Guidelines: Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995" revised in January 1996. Recruitment of consultants would&#13;
follow the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrower and by The World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency, August 1981." The Borrower will use Bank's standard bidding documents for goods&#13;
and works, including the Bank's Regional sample NCB documents for works issued in 1995. For&#13;
consulting assignments the Borrower will use the relevant Bank's standard form of contract. A General&#13;
Procurement Notice would be issued in Development Business in June 1996, followed by individual&#13;
specific notices for contracts above US$10 million. The Project Launch Workshop is planned for&#13;
September 1996.&#13;
4.34          Responsibility for all procurement will rest with the PIU of the MOA. The staff of the&#13;
PIU will include a full time procurement specialist. Moreover, the PIU will be assisted by a consulting&#13;
firm (paras. 4.36(c) and 5.6), which will provide a full time procurement specialist for at least the first&#13;
year of project implementation.&#13;
4.35          There are civil works construction organizations and plants for the fabrication of concrete&#13;
pipes and irrigation structures in nearly all oblasts. During the Soviet era these organizations had&#13;
considerable construction and manufacturing capabilities. Therefore, there should be no major problem&#13;
for most of them to implement the relatively small sub-projects anticipated for implementation under the&#13;
project. All these former state organizations have recently been privatized and converted into joint stock&#13;
12/   Including US$17.8 million of taxes and duties.&#13;

companies; they have financial and managerial autonomy, do not receive subsidies from Government and,&#13;
therefore, meet the eligibility criteria of the Bank's operational directives.&#13;
4.36          Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. Details of the proposed&#13;
arrangements are as follows-3:&#13;
(a)    Works. The project would consist of some 15 sub-projects which will require&#13;
civil works construction and the supply and installment of various types of&#13;
materials and equipment. To simplify procurement arrangements, the bidding&#13;
for the sub-projects will require general contractors to procure, supply and install&#13;
all necessary equipment. Contracts over US$0.5 million would be procured&#13;
through ICB. Based on the currently available list of "reserve projects" (para.&#13;
4.6), it is expected that other smaller valued contracts below US$500,000 each&#13;
would be procured through NCB up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million.&#13;
Works estimated to cost less than $100,000 per contract and up to a maximum&#13;
aggregate amount of US$500,000 may be procured under lump sum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors in response to a written invitation;&#13;
(b)    Goods:&#13;
(i)    ICB (US$1.3 million) procedures would be used for contracts of&#13;
US$200,000 and above;&#13;
(ii)   International Shopping (IS) would be used to procure items included in&#13;
contract packages estimated to cost under US$200,000 each (with an&#13;
aggregate value not exceeding US$3.0 million), such as vehicles, field&#13;
and office equipment, etc. IS shall be based on quotations from at least&#13;
three suppliers in two different countries; and&#13;
(iii)   National ShopDing (NS) would be used for small items or items that can&#13;
be obtained off- the shelf, and for national services (printed materials and&#13;
video/TV productions) estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million on the basis of&#13;
at least three quotations from qualified suppliers.&#13;

(c)    Consultants.  The following consultants and staff would be recruited by the&#13;
PIU: (i) through short-listing a consulting firm to assist, inter alia, with project&#13;
planning, management, procurement, and construction supervision and&#13;
monitoring; and to take responsibility for project design, preparation of bidding&#13;
documents, and undertaking environmental impact assessments (EIAs) (para.&#13;
4.30); value of first contract (for three years) US$7.7 million; (ii) through short-&#13;
listing, a consulting firm, to assist, inter alia, with the pilots for farmers' training&#13;
and information services; (paras. 4.15 to 4.19); All training activities are an&#13;
integral part of the consultant services' contract and its scope, program and&#13;
budget would need to be approved by the Bank. Contract value US$1.5 million;&#13;
(iii) through short-listing, a consulting firm to assist with strengthening the&#13;
environmental capacity of MOA, MOEB and other agencies (para. 4.30);&#13;
contract value US$1.2 million; and (iv) staff for the PIU, selected on the basis&#13;
of job descriptions and a selection process approved by the Bank (total costs&#13;
about US$1.0 million). About 12 local, highly qualified individuals would be&#13;
recruited (initially for one year, with the possibility of extension upon satisfactory&#13;
performance) to staff the PIU and to represent the MOA as the client and the&#13;
main executing agency vis-a-vis other governmental agencies and participating&#13;
farms, and foreign and local consulting firms, and contractors; these individuals&#13;
will cover all required main disciplines, including engineering, procurement,&#13;
agriculture, the environment, cost recovery, farmers' participation, office&#13;
management, accounting and monitoring and evaluation. In addition Resident&#13;
Engineers (one for each sub-project) would be recruited by the PIU to take&#13;
charge of construction supervision.&#13;
4.37          Bank Review. All ICB contracts (both goods and works) would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review, as well as the first works contract following: (i) NCB; and (ii) fixed price contract awarded on&#13;
the basis of three quotations. Also, the letters of invitation for all consulting assignments (including the&#13;
terms of reference) and contracts with consulting firms costing more than US$100,000, as well as sole&#13;
source selection, and contracts with individual consultants costing more than US$50,000 would be subject&#13;
to prior review by the Bank. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by the Bank on a&#13;
random basis. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations that all procurement processes and&#13;
actions under the project would follow the procedures outlined in paras. 4.36 to 4.37.&#13;
4.38          A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) has not yet been completed.&#13;
However, procurement proposed under the project would follow Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
4.39          Information regarding procurement administration would be collected and recorded by&#13;
the PIU and quarterly reports would be sent to the Bank. These reports would also indicate: (a) revised&#13;
cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (b) revised timing of procurement actions and&#13;
completion time; and (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;

J. Disbursements&#13;
4.40          The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of 6 years, and the expected project closing date would be December 31, 2003. There is no experience&#13;
yet to form a disbursement profile for Kazakstan, but it is estimated that the country's ability to&#13;
implement the project over a six-year period is reasonable, especially given that a PIU has already been&#13;
set up. The estimated disbursements during each year of project implementation are shown in Annex 0.&#13;
4.41          The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in US Dollars as shown in Table 4.4 below:&#13;
Table 4.4: Disbursement Categories&#13;

Total                  80.0&#13;
4.42          Direct payment procedures from the Bank to suppliers will be used. Disbursements&#13;
against the categories described in Table 4.4 would be made upon receipt by the Bank of fully&#13;
documented applications, except for: (i) contracts for works valued at less than US$500,000; (ii) contracts&#13;
with consulting firms valued at less then US$100,0QO; and (iii) contracts with individual consultants&#13;
valued at less than US$50,000; contracts for goods costing less than $200,000; disbursements for these&#13;
items would be made against certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for&#13;
SOE would be retained by the Borrower and made available to the Bank during supervision. Direct&#13;
payment application and applications for special comrnitments would be accepted for minimum amounts&#13;
of US$20,000. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in&#13;
one of the major commercial banks to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. An initial deposit of&#13;
US$500,000 would be made, with the amount in the Special Account increased to the ceiling of US$1.0&#13;
million when total disbursements reach US$2.0 million. Applications for replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever&#13;
occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the same procedure as&#13;
described above. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been&#13;
reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. At negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that disbursement arrangements will follow the procedures described above, including the&#13;
establishment and operation of the Special Account. A condition for disbursement of expenditures made&#13;
in respect of Category (2), would be that each sub-project in respect of which disbursement is sought&#13;
would be selected, approved and implemented in accordance with the procedures and eligibility criteria,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
and on ternms and conditions specified in the cost recovery resolution, and in schedule 7 of the loan&#13;
agreement, and satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank will make its decision to finance a sub-project after&#13;
reviewing the feasibility study, the EIA and the SEE review.&#13;
K. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.43            The project has been based on the economic and environmental screening of 141 sub-&#13;
projects in 19 oblasts and which had been included in the Ten Year and Five Year Irrigation Investment&#13;
Plans (paras. 2.30 - 2.31). Feasibility studies have been prepared for 34 sub-projects initially selected for&#13;
inclusion in the Five Year Investment Plan, including 9 core projects currently proposed for&#13;
implementation under the IDIP and the 13 "reserve projects" (para. 4.6). Under the "bridging operation"&#13;
(para. 4.2) the PIU has been set up and staffed and the referred to feasibility studies will be updated for&#13;
sub-projects scheduled with implementation starts in the first year, and EIAs/SEEs for these sub-projects&#13;
will be prepared. Detailed designs and bidding documents for the Year One sub-projects are scheduled&#13;
for completion by July 1996. In addition, a Sector Environmental Analysis (SEA) and two draft sub-&#13;
project specific pilot Environmental Impact Assessments (ElAs) have been prepared; the latter will also&#13;
be finalized during the" bridging operation" (See Annex X for a summary of the SEA). A social&#13;
assessment of 30 farms identified for participation in the project was also undertaken.&#13;
L. Participation&#13;
4.44          Major project stakeholders include the MOA and the CWR and their representatives on&#13;
different administrative levels, design institutes, contractors, farm managers, farm members and&#13;
individual farmers. The project will fund works that originally were included in a long-term irrigation&#13;
and drainage improvement program, most elements of which were incorporated at the initiation of&#13;
managers of former state and collective farms, or at least with their active involvement. With the advent&#13;
of privatization, farm members and independent farmers located on the former state farms have become&#13;
important stakeholders, as they will ultimately be responsible for repayment of the cost of on-farm works.&#13;
The project will actively engage these stakeholders through a transparent 5-step consultation and decision&#13;
making process (Annex P) which will ensure that they are empowered to make important decisions at&#13;
each step in the design and implementation process and that they are clearly aware of the cost and O&amp;M&#13;
implications of the decisions. The project will also promote two other mechanisms to ensure that the&#13;
voices of major stakeholders are factored into decisions and operations. First, given the experience of&#13;
independent farmers being marginalized from farm services, including water, Water User Associations&#13;
(WUAs) will be promoted to ensure that independent farmers have a voice in water management. WUA&#13;
models appropriate for Kazakstan will be developed in early stages of the project. Second, on a pilot&#13;
basis, the project will help prepare a private Irrigation Company at the canal command level, based&#13;
roughly on a U.S. irrigation district model, to manage inter-farm water sources, thus decentralizing water&#13;
administration and increasing the voice of local farmers and farm managers in water allocation decisions&#13;
and inter-farm water management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

M. Enviromnental Aspects and Impacts&#13;
4.45          In accordance and consistent with the requirements of the Bank OD 4.01 "Environmental&#13;
Assessment", the project has been screened and placed into EA Category "B", which requires the&#13;
preparation of an environmental analysis to define environmental management, monitoring and mitigation&#13;
measures as necessary. However, in accordance with Kazak law ElAs should be prepared, and SEE&#13;
reviews conducted for each sub-project. Assurances were obtainedfrom Government at negotiations that&#13;
(i) the proceduresfor selection of sub-projects would include (i) the preparation of EUAs and SEE reviews&#13;
for sub-projects would be conducted within theframework of the recommendations of the SEA and the two&#13;
pilot ElAs, and in accordance with the Bank's and Government's EA requirements and procedures.&#13;
Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that: (i) recommended mitigation measures in the ElAs and&#13;
SEE reviews would become an integral part of project design and implementation; (ii) "chance find"&#13;
procedures would be developed and applied to address the risk of encountering unknown archaeological&#13;
sites and used in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of Kazakstan acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
and (iii) all agrochemicals to be applied under the project would be approved, stored, distributed and&#13;
used in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of Kazakstan acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.46          The project has been subject to field-based environmental review that indicates its positive&#13;
impact on the environment. The project would not expand irrigation to new areas but would improve&#13;
irrigation technology on existing agricultural land, leading to improved water conservation and&#13;
agricultural practices. The proposed drainage improvements on these lands would reduce present and&#13;
potential waterlogging and salinity problems.  The project would have an additional positive&#13;
environmental impact by reducing water losses through improved system conveyance and flow control.&#13;
Pesticide runoff would also be reduced through disseminating information to farmers and training on the&#13;
safe use of pesticides, following Bank requirements on techniques for IPM, thus, in turn, reducing water&#13;
pollution and soil contamination. Adverse impacts will be mainly limited to the construction phase but&#13;
remedial measures will be taken (para. 5.20). The proposed project would not involve involuntary&#13;
resettlement and is not anticipated to have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in any&#13;
of the sub-projects areas.&#13;
N. International Waterways&#13;
4.47          The investment program  under proposed project could affect the rivers that are&#13;
international waterways in accordance with OP 7.50, para. 1 (a) and (b), i.e., rivers and tributaries that&#13;
ultimately flow to and/or are shared with other riparian countries. However, a notification for the&#13;
activities under the project is not required since: (a) the proposed works are limited to the rehabilitation&#13;
of existing schemes. The proposed sub-projects would not expand irrigation to new areas or alter the&#13;
nature of the original schemes. The areas that would be rehabilitated are relatively small; the average area&#13;
with on-farm works is about 2,000 ha. Some collector drains servicing larger areas are anticipated to&#13;
be rehabilitated as well but no additions or alterations are planned as compared to their original design;&#13;
(b) because of the small size of the individual sub-projects, their implementation is not expected to&#13;
adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; the improvements in&#13;
irrigation would have a positive environmental impact by reducing water losses through improved&#13;
conveyance and flow control; new drainage construction is very limited so that the increases in drainage&#13;
discharges will be very small as compared to the water flows in the receiving water bodies; (c) there&#13;
is no indication that any ongoing or planned projects in the riparian countries could adversely affect the&#13;
sub-projects. It may, therefore, be reasonably assumed that the project would not be adversely affected&#13;
by the other riparians possible water use; and (d) a review of existing international agreements and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
arrangements between Kazakstan and riparian countries has shown that none of these legal instruments&#13;
would require notification for the activities to be carried out under the project; GOK has confirmed this&#13;
in writing. All sub-projects to be financed under the loan would be checked by the Government, and&#13;
reviewed by the Bank, to ensure that they meet all applicable international water requirements.&#13;
&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Organization&#13;
5.1           Organization at the National Level. Government has delegated overall responsibility for&#13;
project implementation to the Ministry of Agriculture, except for parts of the environmental sub-&#13;
component (paras. 4.27 and 5.11).&#13;
5.2          Inter-Ministerial Coordination. An Inter-ministerial Coordinating Committee (ICC) has&#13;
been established composed of the Minister of Agriculture (Chairman), the Deputy Ministers of Economy,&#13;
Finance, MOEB, and Construction, the Deputy Chairman of the CWR, the Director of the PIU&#13;
(Secretary) and representatives of the Committee for Foreign Investments, the Ministry of Geology, the&#13;
State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of Land Use (SCLR), the HS, SANEPID, the CF,&#13;
and farm managers. The Committee would meet quarterly, or more frequently when required, to review&#13;
progress and resolve problems of inter-agency coordination.&#13;
5.3           Project Organization at the Provincial Level. Oblast Coordination Committees have been&#13;
established for Year One projects to provide the necessary coordination on project matters at the&#13;
provincial level. Most ministries and national agencies are represented at the Oblast level, so that the&#13;
Committee will be an image of the ICC at the national level. These Committees would be chaired by the&#13;
Deputy Governor of the Oblast. Other OCCs for the remaining sub-projects would be established one year&#13;
prior to the planned implementation period.&#13;
B. The Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
5.4           General. Details of MOA organization are provided in Annex R and Chart 1. MOA does&#13;
not maintain a specialized department for irrigation and drainage planning, design and execution; this task&#13;
was carried out by its design institutes which are now financially self-supporting. Development of new&#13;
projects is currently being promoted by the financially independent Republican Association&#13;
"Kazakgromeliovodkhoz", an agglomeration of design institutes and construction organizations. There&#13;
is no department for extension or training. Environmental monitoring (mostly soil salinity and depth to&#13;
ground water) is the responsibility of three monitoring units, locally called "Expeditions", with offices&#13;
in Almaty, Zhambul and Taldykorgan.&#13;
5.5          Project Implementation Unit. The MOA management, administration and coordination&#13;
of the project will be the direct responsibility of the already established Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU). The Director of the PIU will be directly responsible to the Minister of Agriculture . The PIU will&#13;
have units for Contract Administration, General Administration and Accounting, Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation, and a Technical Unit comprised of the necessary specialists (Charts 2 and 3). Assurances&#13;
were obtained during loan negotiations that the PIU would be adequately staffed and would continue to&#13;
employ a Project Director and professional staff that would be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
5.6          The PIU will contract all consultants required to assist with project implementation,&#13;
including but not limited to: (i) management and engineering consultants to assist with overall project&#13;
planning and management and the design and implementation of the irrigation and drainage works;&#13;
(ii) farm management and training consultants to assist with the implementation of the agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
component; and (iii) environmental consultants to assist with the implementation of the environmental sub-&#13;
component. For summaries of the Terms of Reference see Annex S.&#13;
5.7           Environmental Unit. The MOA has at present no environmental review or planning&#13;
capacity.  An Environmental Unit (EU) would be established in the MOA headed by a Senior&#13;
Environmental Advisor who would be directly responsible to the Minister. He would be supported by&#13;
two environmental specialists. The EU's responsibilities would include but not be limited to: sectoral&#13;
environmental policy making, planning and management to meet MOA responsibilities under national&#13;
environmental legislation; developing MOA's EA capacity for sectoral, regional and project-specific&#13;
activities; coordinating development and enforcing sectoral environmental policy directives; preparing&#13;
sectoral environmental strategies and action plans; coordinating sectoral environmental training; and&#13;
liaising with other environmental agencies. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the&#13;
EU be established within the MOA prior to March 31, 1997.&#13;
C. The Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources&#13;
5.8           General. The Ministry was established in 1992. It is a planning, management and&#13;
monitoring agency mandated to promote the protection and rational use of natural resources. MOEB&#13;
depends on Government funding and is severely curtailed in all aspects of its mission. The Ministry has&#13;
undergone at least two reorganizations since its founding. The recruitment and retention of trained&#13;
specialists remain a problem, and are likely to continue until the economy improves. Laboratory facilities&#13;
are antiquated and ill-equipped, hindering the accomplishment of basic data gathering and enforcement&#13;
(Annex T, Chart 4).&#13;
5.9           State Ecological Expertise (SEE). The law "On Environmental Protection" has provided&#13;
for mandatory SEE (environmental review) prior to making any development decision; public and private&#13;
financing of a project can start only after obtaining a positive SEE. All development programs, plans&#13;
and designs, together with Environmental Impact Assessments are subject to an SEE. All projects with&#13;
foreign investments are subject to SEE at the national level. MOEB's Department for SEE and&#13;
Radiological Safety is responsible for normative requirements and guidelines for EIA and SEE.&#13;
5.10          State Ecological Inspection (SEI). SEI is an organizational entity within MOEB with&#13;
the prime responsibility for state environmental control to ensure compliance with existing legislation,&#13;
standards, requirements and conclusions of SEE. SEI issues licenses and permits for use of natural&#13;
resources, waste disposal, and emissions and discharges of pollutants. It assesses fees and fines for use&#13;
of natural resources and pollution, and clears permits for surface and ground water use, importation of&#13;
agro-chemicals, etc.  SEI also controls handling, storage, transportation, use and distribution of&#13;
pesticides, herbicides and other agro-chemicals; as well as compliance with national environmental and&#13;
water legislation.&#13;
D. Organization of Environmental Sub-Component&#13;
5.11          The overall responsibility for coordinating the activities under the environmental sub-&#13;
component will rest with the PIU, as well as all aspects of contracting, procurement and financial&#13;
management. The principal agencies responsible for the various elements of this sub-component are:&#13;
(a)    Institutional Development: MOA and MOEB;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
(b)    Special Environmental Studies: MOA; MOEB and AAS;&#13;
(c)    Environmental Monitoring: MOA, MOEB, Hydromet, CWR, MOG, SANEPID;&#13;
(d)    Pilot "Clean Drainage Water Project": Kaznekhanobr; and&#13;
(e)    Afforestation: CF.&#13;
Other participating agencies will include the Ministry of Justice, Research and Design Institutes, and&#13;
subordinate national and regional bodies of above ministries. Environmental consultants recruited by PIU&#13;
would assist the PIU and relevant counterpart agencies with implementation.&#13;
E. Organization of Agricultural Component&#13;
5.12          The overall responsibility for implementing the agricultural component will rest with the&#13;
Department for Production, under the direct leadership of MOA's Deputy Minister in charge of this&#13;
Department. However, all aspects of contracting, procurement and financial management will be&#13;
handled by the PIU. Farrm management and training consultants, contracted by the PIU, will take&#13;
responsibility for the preparation of short farmers' training courses and workshops and carry out the&#13;
training, demonstrations and farmers' information services program as spelled out in Annex J. The&#13;
demonstrations in the farmers' field will be planned and carried out in close coordination with the PIU.&#13;
F. Project Preparation and Bank Review&#13;
5.13          Standards for Surveys, Investigations, Planning and Design. Acceptable international&#13;
standards will be introduced for survey, investigation, planning and design practices under the project.&#13;
Criteria for on-farm irrigation planning, drainage planning and comparing economic options for on-farm&#13;
irrigation have been agreed upon and are available in the PIP.&#13;
5.14          Environmental Impact Assessments. Although not required by the Bank, Kazak law&#13;
requires the preparation of ElAs and SEE reviews for each sub-project. These will be prepared by the&#13;
PIU consultants for review and approval by the MOEB. It has been agreed that the already prepared&#13;
draft SEA and two draft pilot EIAs will he finalized during the bridging operation, incorporating the&#13;
comments provided by MOEB and the Bank. The English summaries and conclusions of the SEE&#13;
documents are expected to be furnished to the Bank prior to the submission of the first draft bidding&#13;
documents for civil works.&#13;
5.15          Bank Review. 7he selection of sub-projectsfor which updated/detailedfeasibility studies&#13;
will be prepared would be subject to Bank review and concurrence, based on a review of the pre-&#13;
feasibility reports preparedfor each sub-project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that feasibility&#13;
studies, EIAs and conclusions of SEE reviews for sub-projects would be submitted to the Bank for review&#13;
and approval.&#13;
G. Arrangements for Construction&#13;
5.16         Domestic Construction Capacity. It is expected that most civil works will be undertaken&#13;
by local civil works contractors. More than 30 former state construction organizations have been&#13;
transformed in private joint-stock companies; most of them have experience in irrigation construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
works. Due to lack of Government funding for construction, these contractors have lost much of their&#13;
former production capacity due to heavy reductions in staff, loss of operable equipment and lack of spare&#13;
parts. However, as the sub-projects are small, local construction capacities should still be sufficient for&#13;
implementation. Two week training programs will be conducted to instruct national contractors on the&#13;
contents of the bidding documents, the bidding procedures, commercial practices for importing goods&#13;
and the arrangements for construction supervision.&#13;
5.17          Supply of Locally Manufactured Concrete Elements. Concrete pipes and pre-cast&#13;
irrigation structures are traditionally widely used in Central Asia. Quality of design, production and&#13;
installation have however not always been adequate. The following measures will be taken to overcome&#13;
these problems: (i) appropriate specifications (including the use of air-entraining admixtures to reduce&#13;
damage caused by the many freezing/thawing cycles); (ii) sampling and testing; and (iii) adequate&#13;
construction supervision.&#13;
5.18          Construction Supervision and Quality Control. Independent construction supervision and&#13;
strict control of construction quality on behalf of the client did not exist in the FSU, which contributed&#13;
considerably to poor quality construction as compared to acceptable international standards. To address&#13;
the lack of supervision, detailed procedures for construction management, quality control, inspection&#13;
procedures and material testing have been prepared. Assurances were be obtained during loan&#13;
negotiations that internationally acceptable standardsfor construction and construction supervision would&#13;
be applied during project implementation.&#13;
5.19          Leasing Specialized Construction Equipment. The domestic construction industry lacks&#13;
certain specialized construction equipment such as trenchless tile drain machines. Arrangements will be&#13;
made under the project for the PIU to procure such equipment and lease it to the contractors.&#13;
5.20          Environmental Impact. Procedures to mitigate any adverse impacts during construction&#13;
will be included in the bidding documents; this may cover site stabilization, collection of construction&#13;
materials and wastes, procedures to ensure environmental protection, and the safety and health of&#13;
workers.&#13;
5.21          Project Implementation Plan. The detailed work plan for the first two years of project&#13;
implementation and the preliminary plans for subsequent years are included in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. Assurances were obtained that the detailed workplan will be updated regularly by the PIU, at least&#13;
twice a year, and would be subject to Bank review. Generally the work plan would be updated just prior&#13;
to the arrival of a Bank supervision mission. A typical plan for a sub-project is shown in Annex N.&#13;
H. Farmers' Participation&#13;
5.22          In order to ensure that farmers assume responsibility for the cost and operation and&#13;
maintenance of on-farm project investments, the project will adopt a participatory process to engage&#13;
farmers in decisions regarding design, implementation, O&amp;M and cost recovery. This iterative process&#13;
will begin with the presentation of alternative designs, and continue to the final stage of performance&#13;
testing and turnover, which will include detailed O&amp;M plans. The first step in the process will be to&#13;
develop an acceptable participation framework. Ideally, decisions would be made by a general assembly.&#13;
More likely, however, a group of farmer representatives will be created that will ultimately report to the&#13;
assembly. Each farm will establish its own participation protocol that must be endorsed by the PIU&#13;
before any action is taken. Final approval of any sub-project will require precise documentation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
consultation process, as well as clear guidelines for participation in subsequent decision making and&#13;
monitoring. As a first step in this process all potential participating farms for year I and year 2 sub-&#13;
projects have signed Letters of Intent indicating the farm's desire to participate in the project and to pay&#13;
the cost-recovery fee.&#13;
I. Financing of Sub-Project Works and Equipment&#13;
5.23           The major investment component under the project would be for the rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of on-farm irrigation and drainage systems. Participating farms would have to repay such&#13;
investments. However, the banking system in Kazakstan is still inadequate and would not be able and&#13;
willing to handle long term loans for investments in infrastructure. As Government has clearly an interest&#13;
in protecting agricultural land from further deterioration, it is reasonable that Government would share&#13;
in the risks associated with investing in land improvements. It has been agreed with Government that cost&#13;
recovery for on-farm works and installation of irrigation equipment be undertaken through a cost-recovery&#13;
fee that is linked to the land and would be assessed on a per hectare basis. This would also have the&#13;
advantage that responsibility for repayment is passed on to a new owner after sale, bankruptcy etc. Farms&#13;
would initially sign a letter of intent after general agreement indicating their decision to participate in the&#13;
project and their agreement on the scope of the work to be carried out. Subsequently, after detailed&#13;
designs and cost estimates have been completed, the farms would sign an agreement with the MOA for&#13;
implementation and the terms for repayment.&#13;
5.24            The cost-recovery fee would be a per hectare charge based on the amortization of the&#13;
on-farm investment costs. The water code of 1991 provides the legal basis for such a fee as it contains&#13;
the provisions for per hectare charge to recover the costs of capital The costs would include actual&#13;
construction costs including works and equipment. The fee would seek to recover between 70 to 80&#13;
percent of the investment cost and would be based on a 30 year amortization period with a five year grace&#13;
period an annual interest rate in US Dollars of eight percent. The percentage of costs to be recovered&#13;
is consistent with the fact that some of the benefits of the investments accrue to beneficiaries outside the&#13;
farm (decreased water losses, improved water quality). Since all the benefits can not be captured by the&#13;
participating farms, partial cost recovery from the direct beneficiaries is justified. The annual per hectare&#13;
charge derived from this calculation would be levied and collected by the Oblast level authorities. For&#13;
the inter-farm works, an increased land levy is being proposed for farms benefitting from the&#13;
improvements. The Government has prepared a draft resolution satisfactory to the Bank relating to the&#13;
introduction of the cost recovery fee, including methods of calculating the fee, the selection of sub-&#13;
projects, and eligibility criteria for participating farms. Adoption, by the Government of the resolution,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
J. Plans for Operation and Maintenance&#13;
5.25           Inter-farm Systems. The CWR has initiated a system of water charges to cover the costs&#13;
of inter-farm operation and maintenance charges (para. 2.17). Experience with the system in its first two-&#13;
years shows that the collection rates is about 47 percent, which is resulting in inadequate maintenance&#13;
and deterioration of the system. The major factors explaining the low collection rates are the relative&#13;
newness of the system, the novelty of charging for water, and the overall financial conditions of the farms&#13;
given the low producer prices relative to world market prices. The Government price reforms currently&#13;
being implemented should put farms into a much better position to cover water charges fully beginning&#13;
in 1996. A concerted effort is now required by the Government to assure that discipline is introduced&#13;
and maintained in the collection of water charges. Collection of water charges is undertaken by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
District Water Resources Committees, which are financially self-supporting and entitled to keep the&#13;
revenues to finance their operations. An improved collection rate would thus have an immediate positive&#13;
impact on O&amp;M operations. To this end, assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government&#13;
would implement measures to improve cost recovery rates for 0 &amp; M of inter-farm works in accordance&#13;
with the following schedule: 55 percent by December 31, 1997; 70 percent by December 31, 1998; 80&#13;
percent by December 31, 1999; and greater than 90 percent by December 31, 2000. These measures&#13;
include: (i) monitoring of prices received by producers to determine the impact of price reforms on the&#13;
ability offarms to pay charges; (ii) commitment by the Government to make up any shortfall in collection&#13;
of targeted amounts that can be attributed to lack of progress in Government pricing or marketing&#13;
reforms; and (iii) a system of enforcement to collect any overdue charges.&#13;
5.26         On-farm systems. Generally, most farms have tools and equipment which can also be&#13;
used for on-farm maintenance of the irrigation facilities. Horizontal subsurface drainage systems will&#13;
need periodic cleaning; farms with vertical wells will need to undertake repairs and maintain pumps and&#13;
related equipment. An assurance was obtained during loan negotiations that a detailed O&amp;M plan will&#13;
be preparedfor each sub-project.&#13;
K. Water User Associations&#13;
5.27         Although the management of privatized farms appears to resemble that of the previous&#13;
state farm era, a qualitative shift is occurring with both positive and negative consequences. Management&#13;
accountability is shifting from the MOA to members of the farm. The positive impact of the shift can&#13;
be seen in the way managers are searching for ways to make the farms profitable, and thereby to keep&#13;
their jobs. The negative impact can be see in the way that break-away farm units are virtually ignored&#13;
by farm management. Managers are accountable to farmers, but to members, not non-members. In&#13;
farms where the previous structure is intact, management continues to assume responsibility for the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the farm's irrigation system, generally following old patterns. However,&#13;
focus groups reveal that break-away farmers are generally located at the end of a delivery unit, and they&#13;
frequently are given low priority in irrigation service. The project would support the creation of WUAs&#13;
within the boundaries of the previous state farms, through which the members would assume&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of the irrigation and drainage systems, the main objectives being to ensure an&#13;
equitable and timely water supply to the members of the WUA, and to maintain the system adequately.&#13;
The WUAs would need to adopt appropriate rules and regulations for their governance, water distribution&#13;
and allocation, sanctions for violations, conflict resolution mechanisms, cost sharing etc. To be effective,&#13;
however, the associations must be given legal status, which will require an appropriate legal and&#13;
regulatory framework. An assurance would be obtained during loan negotiations that MOA would&#13;
continue to take action and develop, as necessary with the assistance of consultants, a legal and&#13;
regulatoryframeworkfor the successful establishment andfunctioning of Water UserAssociations (WUAs).&#13;
L. Project Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
5.28         Performnance Monitoring. Monitoring the implementation and performance of the project&#13;
will involve the inventory, collection, processing and analysis of considerable data on water, natural&#13;
resources, land use and agricultural production. Performance monitoring indicators have been agreed&#13;
upon (Annex U). While overall responsibility for coordinating performance monitoring rests with the&#13;
PIU, other entities involved include, inter alia, the Expeditions (for soil salinity, water quality and&#13;
agricultural production), MOEB, and CWR (for collection of water charges) and MOA's Department of&#13;
Production for agricultural training and Farm Management). The management and engineering consultant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
will assist PIU and the Expeditions in establishing a GIS based Performance Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Information System (PIS) to store and process the data. Initially, the PIS would be prepared for a typical&#13;
sub-project such as Chengeldy. Once the GIS database structure and analysis procedures are established,&#13;
the PIS can be turned over to monitoring and evaluation units for implementation. The necessary training&#13;
and technical assistance would be provided to these units to carry out their tasks.&#13;
5.29         Reporting. PIU would prepare: (i) quarterly progress reports on procurement; and&#13;
(ii) semi-annual progress reports by December 31 and June 30; copies would be sent to the Bank for&#13;
review. The semi-annual reports would include information on: (i) completion rate of on-going works;&#13;
(ii) payments made to contractors; (iii) reports on institutional developments (including technical&#13;
assistance and training); (iv) an up-dating of the performance indicators; and (v) a report on difficulties&#13;
encountered, proposed measures to overcome these and assistance required. An up-dated annual budget&#13;
for project implementation will be prepared by October 31 for submission to the Ministry of Finance. A&#13;
Project Completion Report would be prepared by the PIU within 6 months of project completion.&#13;
M. Bank Supervision&#13;
5.30         The supervision plan in Annex V provides details on planned Bank supervision missions.&#13;
An assurance was obtained at loan negotiations that a mid-term review of the project would be undertaken&#13;
by a joint team from the Bank and MOA prior to October 31, 1999.&#13;
N. Accounts and Audits&#13;
5.31         Project accounts will be managed by the PIU. The project accounts would identify all&#13;
sources and uses of funds, including detailed accounting of the proceeds of the Loan and the operation&#13;
of the Special Account. The project account would be audited by an independent auditor, preferably with&#13;
an international accounting firm, acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports would be submitted to the&#13;
MOA and to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit report would contain&#13;
a separate opinion on the operation of the Special Account and the Statement of Expenditure (SOE)&#13;
procedure, if utilized.&#13;

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
6.1              Economic analysis has been used from the outset of project preparation as one of the main&#13;
criteria for screening individual investment sub-projects that were included in the Government's original&#13;
1991 program of irrigation and drainage works. Other factors included in the screening are technical&#13;
feasibility, expected environmental impact and potential for privatization. Based on these criteria, 34&#13;
potential sub-projects were identified during preparation and subjected to further economic and financial&#13;
analysis that resulted in the list of nine core project, and 13 reserve projects that were considered during&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
6.2              The economic analysis is an ongoing process that will continue through the final design&#13;
and approval stages for each sub-project. Feasibility studies are being updated, final cost estimates are&#13;
being prepared and the farms are participating in discussions of investment options and the implications&#13;
for project costs and 0 &amp; M. The dynamic nature of the process has already resulted in the elimination&#13;
of some sub-projects, design changes for some of the other sub-projects, including changes in irrigation&#13;
technology, or in the selection of different areas of rehabilitation and additional changes are likely .i-' One&#13;
or two of the projects that currently are in the core program may still be replaced or substantially revised&#13;
based on further consultations with farm members.&#13;
6.3              In all cases, choices of technology and equipment will be carefully reviewed.  Final&#13;
selection of sub-projects for financing will only be made on the basis of satisfactory results of the&#13;
economic and financial analyses (at least 12 percent rate of return).&#13;
B. The Sub-Projects&#13;
6.4              The economic analysis presented here focuses on the nine core projects identified for&#13;
construction starts in Year One and Two. Base Investment costs for these sub-projects comprise about&#13;
57 percent of base project costs and 70 percent of the base costs for the irrigation and drainage works.&#13;
Seven of the nine sub-projects involve comprehensive on-farm irrigation and drainage rehabilitation&#13;
(CROIL), and two sub-projects involves rehabilitation of on-farm drainage works only, (Annex W,&#13;
Table 1). Five to six sub-projects with investment costs totalling about US$26 million would be selected&#13;
from the list of thirteen reserve projects or from other potential sub-projects for implementation beginning&#13;
in Year Three. While the thirteen sub-projects have not been included in the analysis presented here,&#13;
preliminary economic analysis during preparation and appraisal suggest that they have economic rates of&#13;
return in a similar range to the returns for the Year One and Two sub-projects.&#13;
14/     An example of the type of changes being made in project design and selection occurred in the Chengeldy sub-project. The original&#13;
design proposal included comprehensive irrigation and drainage rehabilitation including pump replacement at a very high investment&#13;
cost. In discussion with farm managers and farm members, it became apparent that rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage in another&#13;
area of the farm serviced by a different pump would not only reduce investment costs substantially but potentially would increase&#13;
benefits as the area under the new scheme had higher yield potential than the original area. The changes also involved a switch from&#13;
sprinkler irrigation to lower cost under surface irrigation. On the basis of these discussions, a new scheme was designed, costed and&#13;
evaluated for inclusion in the core program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
C. Benefits &amp; Costs&#13;
6.5           The primary benefits of the proposed project would be incremental agricultural production&#13;
from: (i) increased efficiency in water use in the irrigation sub-projects through improved water delivery&#13;
and irrigation practices; (ii) reversing the declines in yields from water logging and salinity build-up&#13;
through improved drainage; (iii) expanded area cultivated through reclamation of some abandoned areas;&#13;
and (iv) higher agricultural productivity as a result of farmers honing water management skills, adopting&#13;
improved cultural practices, and switching to improved varieties and higher value crops. Benefit streams&#13;
were derived separately for each sub-project and comprised yield increases, increased area under crop&#13;
due to reclamation of abandoned irrigated areas, and in some instances changes in cropping patterns.&#13;
6.6           Yields throughout Kazakstan have declined by 12 to 70 percent since 1990 due largely&#13;
to the economic crisis that has affected input use, fuel supplies, and equipment availability (paras. 1.7,&#13;
3.4). However, for the without-project case, it is assumed that the policy reforms currently being&#13;
implemented by the Government will restore the incentive structure facing all farms and quickly reverse&#13;
the recent decline in yields. Thus, rather than using the most recent yield data for the with-out project&#13;
case, crop yields have been adopted that equal the average levels achieved in the three years prior to&#13;
independence.  For the with-project situation the assumptions used are as follows:&#13;
-      Comprehensive On-Farm Irrigation and Drainage (eight sub-projects). Yields&#13;
are expected to grow by 23 to about 100 percent depending on the crop and sub-&#13;
project area, with most yield increases in the 40 to 60 percent range (Annex W,&#13;
Table 2). It is assumed that the full yields under with-project conditions would&#13;
be achieved in the fifth year, starting from with-out project yields in year one.&#13;
*      On-Farm  Drainage Works (two sub-projects).  Incremental production is&#13;
expected from two sources. First, without the investment in drainage, yields&#13;
would decrease due to increased salinity and water logging. The gradual build-&#13;
up in salinity could eventually reduce yields to zero. For the analysis it was&#13;
assumed that the without-project yields would decline by one percent per annum&#13;
over a ten year period and stabilize thereafter. Second, with improved drainage,&#13;
yield increases could be anticipated.  With-project yields were assumed to&#13;
increase from 10 to 20 percent depending on the crop over the first five years.&#13;
6.7           Aside from yield increases, area under crop is expected to increase by about 10 percent&#13;
or 2,200 hectares (Annex W, Table 1). The increase arises through the reclamation of irrigated lands&#13;
presently abandoned due to waterlogging and poor drainage. Cropping pattern assumptions in the with-&#13;
project case are derived largely from technical and agronomic recommendations for the agro-climatic and&#13;
soil conditions found in each sub-project.&#13;
6.8           Besides the direct benefits to the sub-projects from the proposed investments, a potentially&#13;
significant stream of benefits accruing to a larger segment of the farm sector could come from the pilot&#13;
initiatives under the agricultural component.  The benefits from the information generated by the&#13;
component are difficult to quantify. But three potential type impacts are foreseen:&#13;
*      Direct improvements in productivity and production because of information on&#13;
improved technological packages and management practices disseminated through&#13;
demonstration plots, and the print and broadcast media.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
*      Improved Government services as the pilot initiatives tested under the project&#13;
yield information that will enable the Government to design and implement&#13;
effective farm support services quickly. In essence, the pilot could accelerate the&#13;
learning curve on how to best provide farm services thereby bringing benefits on&#13;
-stream from farm restructuring and improved farm management practices faster&#13;
than would be the case without the project.&#13;
*      A  similar set of benefits would arise from  the institutional component.&#13;
Improvements in the capacity of the Government to use participatory approaches&#13;
in the planning, design and implementation of public investments in irrigation&#13;
could lead to better investment decisions and faster implementation.&#13;
6.9           Another set of benefits that are difficult to quantify and often which also accrue to a&#13;
larger population than the direct beneficiaries arise from the expected environmental impact of the project.&#13;
Namely, the project would: (i) increase water availability down-stream through more efficient water use&#13;
on sub-project farms; and (ii) improve water quality and availability through better drainage. Moreover,&#13;
the project's interventions to strengthen environment monitoring capabilities could lead to improved&#13;
investment decisions where water availability is a dominant factor and better operational decisions related&#13;
to water use in existing enterprises where water is an essential input.&#13;
6.10          Price and Currency Assumptions. The monetary unit for the analysis is the US Dollar.&#13;
Prices for non-traded items are 1995 prices converted to dollars using average exchange rates prevailing&#13;
at that time. The prices of non-tradeable goods and services in Kazakstan are expected to increase&#13;
significantly in the medium term relative to internationally tradeable goods to correct for the substantial&#13;
undervaluation of the real exchange rate of the tenge. The magnitude and timing of the correction is&#13;
uncertain. For planning purposes and for the economic and financial projections, it is assumed that local&#13;
costs and prices will increase at a rate of 15 percent per annum over the project implementation period&#13;
relative to the increases in foreign costs (of importable goods and services) which are assumed to move&#13;
in line with the Bank's projections of increases in the Bank's MUV index. Since the analysis focuses on&#13;
project starts in the next two years and since project construction for each sub-project is expected to take&#13;
two to three years, all local prices have been adjusted from 1995 levels to the year 2000.&#13;
6.11          Farm gate prices for tradable commodities were derived by using the World Bank&#13;
projections for year 2000 in 1990 constant price, using the G-5 Manufacturing Unit Value Indices for&#13;
inflation adjustment (Annex W, Table 3). Prices for non-traded commodities (fruits and vegetables) were&#13;
updated using the 1995 prices from local markets and escalated at an annual rate of 15 percent over the&#13;
project implementation period. The value of fodder crops is based on the calculation of net returns&#13;
estimated from feeding sheep, beef cattle and dairy cows. The value of livestock products used to&#13;
estimate the price for fodder units was also based on international market prices.&#13;
6.12          Investment Costs. Calculation of investment costs for the economic analysis includes the&#13;
full cost of the sub-project investment net of taxes adjusted as discussed above to account for the&#13;
anticipated appreciation in the exchange rate for the tenge. (see Annex W, Table 1 for impact of this&#13;
adjustment on investment costs). Replacement costs for sprinkler equipment, pumps, flow meters and&#13;
hydrants were also included in the analysis. In addition to the civil works and equipment associated with&#13;
the rehabilitation of the irrigation works, the costs of the agricultural component were included in the&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
6.13          Operating Costs.  Estimates of input requirements with the project are based on&#13;
recommendation of Kazak Research Organizations. These estimates were reviewed and amended during&#13;
project preparation to ensure that quantities of labor, seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides are&#13;
consistent with the anticipated yield increases. Farm tractor and machinery costs were based on the lines&#13;
of equipment needed for 100 ha of each crop, and 1995 prices quoted by the company that supplies the&#13;
equipment. 0 &amp; M for on-farm irrigation works were also included.&#13;
D. Econoniic Analysis&#13;
6.14          Economic rates of return have been calculated for nine of the sub-projects in the core&#13;
program. The net benefit and cost streams were then aggregated to arrive at overall calculation for all&#13;
nine sub-projects. Costs for the economic analysis includes the full economic cost of reconstruction and&#13;
reclamation works, the cost of the agricultural component, and estimated incremental operation and&#13;
maintenance charges. The economic costs range from US$850 to US$5,800 per hectare for sub-projects&#13;
that include comprehensive irrigation and drainage works. Rates of return for the eleven sub-projects&#13;
range from 15 to 54 percent with the overall rate of return for the nine sub-projects estimated at 27&#13;
percent with an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The net present value of the nine projects is&#13;
estimated at about US$31 million.&#13;

6.15       Switching values were calculated for each sub-project for decreased benefit flows and&#13;
increased costs. As would be expected, the sub-projects with relatively low rates of return were the most&#13;
sensitive to changes in benefits and investment costs (Table 6.2). Since investment costs can be estimated&#13;
with reasonable accuracy and the sensitivity analysis shows that the sub-projects are relatively robust in&#13;
face of increased investment costs, the following risk analysis focuses largely on the benefit stream.&#13;

E. Risks&#13;
6.16          A major risk facing the project is that the expected yield increases will fail to materialize.&#13;
The estimated benefit stream for the sub-projects involving comprehensive on-farm rehabilitation of&#13;
irrigation and drainage depends to a large extent upon the farms achieving much higher yields. While&#13;
the with-project yields assumptions are well below what is technically feasible based on agro-climatic and&#13;
soil conditions, results from research stations, and yields in similar conditions elsewhere, they are still&#13;
much higher than what was achieved in the past. To realize these higher yields will require an adequate&#13;
incentive environment as well as the availability of inputs, fuel, machinery spare parts and financing.&#13;
It appears that the government's price marketing and trade reforms are already improving the incentive&#13;
structure in agriculture and the government is committed to completing the reform process as quickly as&#13;
possible. Also important is the need for information and training in improved technologies, and better&#13;
farm and water management practices. The project addresses this issue directly through the agricultural&#13;
component which is intended to strengthen farm management and provide information and training on&#13;
improved agricultural and water management practices. To test for sensitivity to reduced yields, the with-&#13;
project yield assumptions at full development were reduced by 25 percent for the seven sub-projects&#13;
involving comprehensive irrigation and drainage. All the sub-projects remained viable under the reduced&#13;
yield assumptions (Table 6.3'&#13;

6.17          Another risk for the project benefit stream arises from price uncertainty. There are two&#13;
issues. First, is the financial risk that government price, trade and marketing policy would continue to&#13;
drive a wedge between domestic and world market prices. For the financial analysis, prices were kept&#13;
the same as for the economic analysis under the assumption that the current pace of government reform&#13;
would be sustained, so that by the time the first year projects are completed in 1998, no significant gap&#13;
would remain. The experience during 1995 of apparently significant improvement in farm prices supports&#13;
the assumption that domestic markets will become fully integrated with international markets well before&#13;
that time.&#13;
6.18          The second issue relates to the price levels assumed for the economic and financial&#13;
analysis, particularly for crops considered to the non-traded. There is considerable uncertainty about the&#13;
magnitude of the expected correction for the undervalued real exchange rate of the tenge (para. 6.10).&#13;
In the analysis, it was assumed the prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables would rise faster than the&#13;
prices of traded goods. It is possible that because of the relative price changes, commodities such as&#13;
fruits and vegetables that are now not traded could potentially become traded. It is also possible that a&#13;
production response to higher prices could dampen domestic price increases. To test for such uncertainty,&#13;
prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables were held constant at their 1995 level while local investment&#13;
costs were inflated at 15 percent per annum throughout the investment period. The results show that one&#13;
of the projects with an ERR's near the opportunity cost of capital are sensitive to such price changes and&#13;
become unviable (Table 6.3).&#13;
6.19          Another financial risk is that Government is unable to provide the estimated $20 million&#13;
as its contribution to project costs. The project has been scaled to a level commensurate with likely&#13;
availability of Government resources to cover local costs. The Government has also placed a high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
priority on such rehabilitation efforts and assurances were obtained at negotiations that adequate budgetary&#13;
provisions will be made in the budget.&#13;
6.20          An institutional risk arises from the fact that the proposed executing agencies may not&#13;
have the capacity to administer such a large and diverse reconstruction effort to the international standards&#13;
required. The project would address this risk through two different measures. First, consultants will be&#13;
recruited to assist the PIU in overall project management and planning. The consultants will also be&#13;
responsible for supervision of construction. Second, the project will provide training to the local&#13;
construction agencies expected to participate in the project in bidding procedures, understanding the&#13;
bidding documents and arrangements for construction supervision and bid preparation. To assess the&#13;
impact of this risk, the overall rate of return was tested for sensitivity to delays in project implementation.&#13;
A one year delay in project benefits decreased the ERR from 27 to 19 percent.&#13;
F. Financial Analysis&#13;
6.21          Financial analysis was undertaken to asses the ability of all the sub-project farms to pay&#13;
for the investments in on-farm works. For the analysis, financial prices are assumed to be the same as&#13;
economic prices as government price, markets and trade reforms currently implemented are expected to&#13;
remove remaining distortions well before construction of works are completed. Investment costs as well&#13;
as costs for inputs are adjusted by including the value-added tax and import duties.&#13;

- 48 -&#13;
6.22             The results show a range in FRR's of 11 to 41 percentL5'. The analysis suggests that sub-&#13;
projects at the lower end of the range would find it difficult to pay cost-recovery fees based on full&#13;
recovery of investment costs including the value-added tax. However, the Government has decided that&#13;
calculations of the cost recovery fee would exclude the value added tax, Moreover, because of expected&#13;
externalities arising from the on-farm investments, the Government will set the cost recovery fee rate&#13;
between 70 and 80 percent of on-farm investments. Under these assumptions, the financial rates of&#13;
returns for all sub-projects would be satisfactory.&#13;
15/     Akkumsky is just below the proposed cut off but will be retained in the investment program because of the parallel pilot activities&#13;
to be undertaken on the farm with grant financing.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
FARM PRIVATIZATION&#13;
1.            A Social Assessment was undertaken by a local private research firm prior to the mission.&#13;
The assessment focused primarily on the issues of privatization and participation. There were five main&#13;
components to the social assessment. One component, consisting of a series of rapid farm assessments,&#13;
was conducted by a Bank social scientist. The other components were undertaken by the local private&#13;
research firm: in-depth interviews with the managers of 30 farms being considered for inclusion in the&#13;
project; a socio-economic survey of 495 households on 10 of the 30 farms located in 5 oblasts; focus&#13;
group discussions in 5 of the 10 farms, each of which has experienced some degree of restructuring; and&#13;
an overview of the roles and relationships of other institutional stakeholders at the national, oblast and&#13;
district level, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee for Water Resources. The&#13;
Mission made use of preliminary data from the management interviews and survey; final data will be&#13;
available in late July and a full report will be completed thereafter. This brief note concentrates on the&#13;
privatization and participation issues that most immediately affect the decision to proceed with project&#13;
preparation.&#13;
Privatization&#13;
2.            Since 1992, 1,700 state farms in Kazakstan have been privatized. The remaining 425&#13;
farms are scheduled to be privatized by the early 1996. It is very clear, however, that privatization is&#13;
a process, not a discrete event, and formal registration is only the beginning of the process. When the&#13;
members of state farms decide on the structure of a new privatized entity or entities and adopt appropriate&#13;
by-laws, they take the first step in a longer process that will continue to evolve over time. Consequently,&#13;
the proposed project will not influence privatization policies or the implementation of basic policies, but&#13;
it will contribute to the evolution of the privatization process and, as appropriate, the subsequent&#13;
restructuring of former state farms.&#13;
The Formal Process&#13;
3.            By all accounts, formal privatization has been a lengthy procedure, largely directed by&#13;
officials of the oblast administration under the oversight of the State Committee for Privatization. The&#13;
basic process unfolds as follows:&#13;
*      before privatization the Committee assesses the value of property on a farm,&#13;
allowing for debt, inflation and depreciation, and establishes a standard "land&#13;
share" for each farm member that will eventually materialize as a certificate.&#13;
*      farm  management generally undertakes an informal consultation process to&#13;
establish the basis for consensus on the structure of the new farm, as well as the&#13;
allocation of land and property shares.&#13;
*      this is formalized in a meeting of the general assembly during which working&#13;
members of the farm choose the model of privatization, establish by-laws, decide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                                   Annex A&#13;
on the allocation of assets--property shares and land certificates--and elect a&#13;
manager.&#13;
*      distribution arrangements vary--working members receive both property shares&#13;
and land certificates; they also decide whether or not to issue land certificates to&#13;
"social workers," pensioners and others, as well as a formula for allocation.&#13;
*      subject to the decision of the assembly, a manager who has been on the farm&#13;
more than 20 years is entitled to receive 10 percent of the land, as well as&#13;
temporary use of another 10 percent that can be converted into ownership if&#13;
production improves significantly over 5 years.&#13;
4.            Farm members actually choose the structure of the newly privatized entity or entities,&#13;
sometimes against the recommendation of management.  Through farm  managers, each oblast&#13;
administration has promoted a particular model, invariably based on the establishment of a single large&#13;
commercial farm that essentially maintains the previous management structure. The oblasts also provide&#13;
model by-laws that the farms adapt and submit to the State Committee for approval.&#13;
Practice and Results&#13;
5.            In practice, administrators have only been partially successful in their attempts to manage&#13;
the process. Although most farms adopt the model being promoted by the oblast, the interpretation of&#13;
the model varies from one farm to the next and appears to be subject to change over time. That is,&#13;
despite the efforts of oblast administrations to limit farm restructuring, it is nevertheless occurring.&#13;
Likewise, some farm managers have been elected to remain in their previous positions, but others have&#13;
been replaced immediately, generally by a member of the farm. Members of many farms refuse to grant&#13;
eligible managers the 10 percent share permitted by decree, even if they retain them. Invariably, the new&#13;
farm has an overall management structure that resembles the previous state structure; however the&#13;
appearance is somewhat deceptive, as management roles are rapidly evolving in response to new rules&#13;
and new clients. Although they have limited choices, farm members ultimately assume an active role in&#13;
the deliberations and decisions, frequently surprising managers and officials. Whatever structure is&#13;
chosen, members legally are guaranteed the right to exit a larger group and obtain their own share of the&#13;
land, and managers are accountable to the membership.&#13;
6.            Of the 30 farms subject to management interviews, 22 have already been privatized and&#13;
7 more will be privatized before the end of the year. Only one farm, a research farm, is not slated to&#13;
be privatized and thus will be excluded from the project. Privatization has taken several forms, most of&#13;
which are basically collectives or associations of smaller cooperatives and/or private family units. Each&#13;
has retained some elements of the previous management structure either as the management entity or as&#13;
an umbrella, coordinating entity. They fall roughly into five categories:&#13;
*     joint stock companies (8), in which members receive shares with the right to&#13;
dividends, as well as debt obligations, in proportion to their property shares;&#13;
operationally members and/or brigades work under an annual contract, which&#13;
specifies production obligations as well as the responsibilities of farm&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                                    Annex A&#13;
*      collective enterprises (7), covering a wide spectrum of arrangements from an&#13;
aggregate of small units to a large unit which may preserve the former&#13;
management structure with the exception that the manager is elected by farm&#13;
members; if the latter, land certificates do not relate to specific holdings unless&#13;
a member separates from the group and establishes a separate farm.&#13;
*      farmers associations (6), which can include individual farms, cooperatives and&#13;
farms and combinations; the overall management increasingly provides services,&#13;
rather than direction.&#13;
*      comrade associations (3), similar to collectives except that individual farmers&#13;
execute annual contracts with management and share profits related to effort as&#13;
well as success at meeting targets.&#13;
*      private enterprises (4), which include both single ownership farms and other&#13;
arrangements under which farm members essentially function as employees.&#13;
7.            Nineteen of the 30 proposed project farms have already restructured to some degree.&#13;
Joint stock companies are the least likely types to restructure. Fourteen of the restructured farms have&#13;
a single large unit or association and a number of small units, either individual family farms or small&#13;
cooperative units that generally aggregate the holdings of an extended family. The range extends from&#13;
a cooperative and 3 small units to an association and 2032 small units. All of the farms that privatized&#13;
in 1992 have restructured somewhat; in one case, at least, small family units broke away after two years.&#13;
We expect this pattern to become common, but it is still too early to determine whether or not this will&#13;
be the case. The other five of the restructured farms have both individual farms, larger units that may&#13;
or may not correspond to the previous brigade structure, and an umbrella association.&#13;
Assessment&#13;
8.            The situation is very fluid. The privatization experience is either recent or emerging on&#13;
the proposed farms, and it will take a few years to establish clear patterns. It is too early to expect major&#13;
restructuring to be widespread, but it is clear that new management pattems are getting established and&#13;
the adoption of one structure does not preclude changing it over time. On balance, the mission concluded&#13;
that the environment is basically positive and dynamic. There seems to be a tendency toward greater&#13;
variation in type of ownership over time, rather than less, and farm structures will continue to evolve.&#13;
Similarly, farm management will become more accountable as farmers get used to making more decisions&#13;
and increase their demands on managers.&#13;
9.            The first step in the privatization process has been neither as open, informed or&#13;
transparent as it could have been, but it is clear that farmers ultimately chose a course for their future&#13;
and managers understand what it means to be accountable to their members. Consequently, the important&#13;
issue to consider is the future of the privatization and restructuring processes. Next steps will depend&#13;
very much on the results of experience, as well as a number of external factors beyond the control of&#13;
either farmers or farm managers. Ultimately, the real test of privatization is the extent to which the new&#13;
farms, collectives and enterprises are financially viable and improve the standard of living of farmers and&#13;
farm members. Further evolution of farms, and more restructuring can be expected to result from either&#13;
or both of two scenarios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                                    Annex A&#13;
*      a positive experience encourages new farm entrepreneurs to emerge, leading to&#13;
the creation of new units that are appropriate scale for local conditions, including&#13;
markets; or&#13;
*      a negative experience prompts members to break away from larger units to create&#13;
subsistence units over which they have some modicum of control, however&#13;
limited may be the prospects for future prosperity.&#13;
10.           A third scenario poses a particular threat to the privatization process, as well as&#13;
restructuring: land consolidation in the hands of a few families or managers. Some farm managers and&#13;
brigade leaders have already begun the process of aggregating land certificates in the attempt to create&#13;
large operating units or to gain sole ownership. Until a land market develops, and until the economic&#13;
situation improves in Kazakstan in general, and on particular farms, both farms and farmers are extremely&#13;
vulnerable. Given the legacy of the state farms, it is reasonable to expect cooperative and collective&#13;
tendencies to persist among members of the farms, particularly because most of them were actually farm&#13;
workers, not farmers; furthermore, even without the state farm legacy, it is unrealistic to expect most&#13;
farm workers to become independent farmers. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect new farmers to&#13;
emerge over time. But until they have gained experience, it is premature to expect most farmers to be&#13;
able to make informed choices about their future roles as members of a large group or independent&#13;
entrepreneurs. Farners now appear to be subject to exploitation by managers who have better access to&#13;
information and real management experience. If farm managers are permitted to take advantage of the&#13;
current vulnerability of farm members and consolidate land holdings, this process may be irreversible,&#13;
thus precluding other members of the farm from making choices in the future. Our interviews suggest&#13;
that farm members are not passive and may be able to resist such exploitation in some places, but this&#13;
should not be left to chance. Until the privatization process has matured and people clearly have more&#13;
options, efforts to accumulate use right certificates in few hands should be discouraged.&#13;
11.           Some concern has been expressed that providing support to farms in Kazakstan,&#13;
particularly for longer term assets, would impede further evolution of the farm restructuring process.&#13;
This does not appear to be a serious concern for three reasons:&#13;
i      First, economic uncertainty currently makes farmers reluctant to be innovative,&#13;
thus infrastructural investments that improve irrigation and drainage will enhance&#13;
the economic status of the farms and offer new opportunities to farmers. This&#13;
will promote further changes, rather than impede them.  The training and&#13;
information components of the project will also support this by increasing the&#13;
level of skills needed for independent farming.&#13;
*      Second, mechanisms that promote participation and ownership, such as the&#13;
consultation process to be introduced in the project, will also encourage promote&#13;
entrepreneurship and restructuring. This will be included in the project.&#13;
*      Finally, irrigation fields are small enough to accommodate restructuring without&#13;
requiring additional investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                                    Annex A&#13;
12.           In sum, the proposed project will support the ongoing process of farm restructuring.&#13;
Training and Information&#13;
13.           Farmers are reluctant to break away from new collective or corporate farms for a number&#13;
of reasons: acceptance of existing management forms; lack of management skills that would enable them&#13;
to operate new farms; lack of effective marketing structures; lack of operating capital and access to credit;&#13;
and limited availability of inputs, spare parts and information. Although marketing, capital and inputs&#13;
are critical issues, they are beyond the scope of the project. Farm management is important for the&#13;
project, however, as it will affect the potential for increasing agricultural production that is created by&#13;
the project. It is also important for the privatization process because management skills will affect the&#13;
willingness of individuals or groups to risk establishing new units, as well as the survival of the new units&#13;
that are established. The project will develop a number of practical training courses on production and&#13;
management issues, demonstrations of improved water management and production technologies and&#13;
create broader information dissemination mechanisms. This management training component--both&#13;
financial and technical--will support privatization very concretely by assisting new family and small&#13;
cooperative farms, as well as larger units that consider restructuring.&#13;
Participation&#13;
14.           A critical stage of farm privatization is when the farm  (managers and/or farmers)&#13;
extricates itself from the web of external controls and assumes responsibility for all aspects of farm&#13;
operations, undertaken either individually or collectively.  To strengthen the process of sharing&#13;
responsibility the mission developed a multi-step consultation process to incorporate into the project&#13;
design and implementation plan. This will engage both farmers and managers in making decisions and&#13;
assuming responsibility for farm assets to be affected by the project. This iterative consultation process&#13;
will broaden the prevailing concept of farm management and will contribute significantly, although&#13;
indirectly, to making further steps in the privatization process more open, more transparent, and more&#13;
informed.&#13;
Water User Associations&#13;
15.           The current management structure on most farms is adequate to deal with water-related&#13;
issues without requiring the creation of new organizations. However, as farms restructure, water user&#13;
associations will be useful to fill institutional gaps. Appropriate models for Kazakstan will be developed&#13;
under the PPF that build on and strengthen community bonds. The project will then launch pilot efforts&#13;
on farms already restructured to test and refine the models.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IWGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
OVERVIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
Organization of the Sector&#13;
1.           A number of ministries, agencies, and organizations are responsible for managing and&#13;
administering the water resources and environmental policies effecting the water and irrigation sectors&#13;
in the Republic of Kazakstan. Since 1991, with the transition to a market economy, a number of&#13;
organizational and structural changes have taken place within the Government.  The Ministry of&#13;
Reclamation and Water Management was eliminated in 1991 and replaced by the Committee on Water&#13;
Resources. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB) was established in 1992 as the&#13;
successor to the State Commnittee on Ecology and Nature Use and the Ministry of Forestry. Other changes&#13;
may be expected in response to changing demands on the Government. The major institutions of the&#13;
Government of Kazakstan concerned with the irrigation sector include:&#13;
*     Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the&#13;
development of agricultural policy.; implementation of a program for the&#13;
development of the agro-industrial complex; preparation of an investment policy&#13;
for agriculture; promoting the rational use of farm lands; registration and&#13;
management of the Land Fund. There are 16 subdivisions and 40 lower divi-&#13;
sions in MOA throughout the Republic. Under the umbrella of MOA there are&#13;
regional and district agricultural agencies funded by local budgets, union associ-&#13;
ations, and numerous related but independent organizations.&#13;
-     Kazak Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The Kazak Academy of Agricultural&#13;
Sciences contains 32 scientific institutes, which conduct research on resources&#13;
related to agriculture, including forest management, range management, fisheries&#13;
development, water management, and agro-economics.&#13;
*     Ministry of Geology and Protection of Underground Resources (MOG). The&#13;
Ministry is the key state authority in the field of geological prospecting and&#13;
protection of the underground resources, including water; sector policy-making&#13;
and programming; licensing of underground resources; and enforcement of&#13;
relevant legislation.&#13;
*     Committee for Water Resources (CWR). Its main responsibilities are to main-&#13;
tain and operate the existing interfarm system for delivery of irrigation and rural&#13;
drinking water through regional and district water resource committees; control&#13;
the quantity and quality of water through the supervision of eight river basin&#13;
water management agencies; set national water management policies; and&#13;
administer international river systems with respect to water sharing.&#13;
*     Water Management Design Institutes. There are a number of design institutes&#13;
in Kazakstan with experience in the planning and design of irrigation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                                    Annex B&#13;
drainage projects. Most of these are now joint stock companies still depending&#13;
on the State as a client. The capability of these institutes has been greatly&#13;
reduced over the last several years because of a lack of funds. Kazgiprovodkhoz&#13;
(DI) is the former central water management design institute for Kazakstan and&#13;
still works closely with the Committee on Water Resources. Most of the regional&#13;
institutes have been placed under administrative control of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture.&#13;
*      Construction Organizations. There are general contract construction organiza-&#13;
tions known as industrial unities (ICU) in each of the oblasts. Production and&#13;
construction capabilities of these organizations have been cut way back. These&#13;
former state construction companies are in transition from ownership by the State&#13;
Committee for Property to private joint stock companies. They all have a similar&#13;
organizational structure that includes a mobile mechanized fleet, a production&#13;
engineering department, a specialized section for start up and fabrication, and&#13;
separate plants for production and fabrication. Each region has facilities for&#13;
producing prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and metal works.&#13;
Although there are several cement factories and a pressure pipe factory in&#13;
Kazakstan, many items such as pvc drainage pipe, pumps, and irrigation&#13;
sprinkler equipment were manufactured in Russia.&#13;
*      Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB). It is an environmental&#13;
policy planning, management, monitoring and enforcement agency mandated to&#13;
promote the protection and rational use of natural resources. The Ministry is&#13;
responsible for EA environmental protection and rational state control for use of&#13;
natural resources that includes land resources, soil, water, forests, wildlife and&#13;
fisheries. MOEB establishes and administers limits on use of natural resources;&#13;
issues and regulates licenses and permits; determines acceptable limits on waste&#13;
products and regulates their discharge in terms of quality and location; reviews&#13;
the standards and limits established by other agencies; and assesses the environ-&#13;
mental effects of projects and programs, prior to their construction or recon-&#13;
struction.&#13;
-      Committee on Forestry (CF) is responsible for forestry policy making, program&#13;
development forest cadastre and standard setting; forest protection and refores-&#13;
tation, developing economic incentives and mechanisms for forest protection and&#13;
use.&#13;
*      Hydrometeorological Service (HS). The Hydromet is the principal authority in&#13;
the field of hydrometeorology and pollution monitoring, including weather,&#13;
water, soil, climate, etc. forecasting for agricultural purposes, conducting&#13;
weather modification activities and keeping an environmental pollution data bank.&#13;
*      Ministry of Construction, Architecture and Housing. The Department of Non-&#13;
Agency Expertise under this Ministry has responsibility to enforce construction&#13;
norms and standards in all construction activities. The Ministry reviews all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                                  Annex B&#13;
projects involving new construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities to&#13;
ensure that Government standards and norms are met.&#13;
*     Ministry of Health (MOH). State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service (SanEpid)&#13;
under the MOH has the responsibility for standards setting determining, preven-&#13;
tion and mitigation of negative impacts of environrnental pollution on human&#13;
health.&#13;
*     State Committee on Land Relations and Organization of LAnd Use (SCLR).&#13;
SCLR is the main government agency entrusted with developing and implement-&#13;
ing unified state policy on land management and ensuring land reform in the&#13;
country. Other responsibilities include: state control for use and protection of&#13;
land, land monitoring and state land cadastral, preservation and rehabilitation of&#13;
soil fertility.&#13;
*     State Council on Ecology (SCE). SCE was created in 1993 in order to ensure&#13;
cross-sectoral coordination on environmental issues and enforcement of imple-&#13;
mentation of environmental protection activities and legislation. Unfortunately,&#13;
the Government resolution remained mainly on paper.&#13;
*     Ministry of Economy. This Ministry is responsible for preparing, approving,&#13;
and recommending technical projects for government funding. The State Price&#13;
Committee which sets the level of prices for sale of commodities to the State is&#13;
located in this Ministry.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
2.            There are a number of special codes and separate laws on water. However there has&#13;
never been any legal arbitration dealing with the water laws, regulations or codes. Some of the major&#13;
laws and codes involving the water resource and agriculture sectors include Law "On Environmental&#13;
Protection" (June 1991) which establishes state ownership of the natural resources, including land, water,&#13;
minerals, forests and wildlife; "Water Code" (March 1993) with the purpose of regulating water for&#13;
domestic industrial and agricultural use and to ensure meeting environmental requirements; "Forestry&#13;
Code" (January 1993) which describes the aims and scope of forestry legislation and introduces the&#13;
concept of forest fund and forest fund lands and clearly states that forests are exclusive property of the&#13;
Republic; decree on "Land" (December 1995) which elaborates on land ownership and classifies lands&#13;
depending on the purpose of their use; Law " On Land Reform in Kazakstan" (June 1991) which states&#13;
the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major directions; "Code on Underground Resources&#13;
and Processing of Mineral Raw Materials" (May 1992) which defines underground resources as State&#13;
property; and the Law "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-being of the Population" (July 1994) which&#13;
declares the right of the people for healthy environment and establishes administrative, disciplinary,&#13;
material and criminal liability for violation of Sanepid legislation.&#13;
Law "On Enviromnental Protection" June 18, 1991&#13;
3.            This is the umbrella environmental legislation in the country. The law establishes state&#13;
ownership of the natural resources, including land, water, minerals, forests and wildlife. The law&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                    Annex B&#13;
mandates SEE for proposed development programs and projects to ensure environmental sustainability&#13;
and provides for public participation.&#13;
4.            Three types of environmental protection instruments are provided by the law: a permit&#13;
system; emission standards (for air and water pollution and waste disposal); pollution fees and fines for&#13;
use of natural resources and emission of pollutants.&#13;
5.             Liability for environmental damage is supported by a provision of the following sanctions:&#13;
disciplinary; administrative; civil and criminal.&#13;
"Water Code" March 31, 1993&#13;
6.            The aim  of the water legislation is to regulate water for domestic industrial and&#13;
agricultural use and to ensure compliance with environmental requirements. Regulations on pollution&#13;
prevention and water conservation are stipulated. Principles of state registration and planning of water&#13;
consumption, settlement of disputes and violations are included. Water resources are in the exclusive&#13;
property of the state. Priority water use is for drinking and communal purposes. It is prohibited to put&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems into operation without adequate measures designed to mitigate waterlog-&#13;
ging, flooding, salinization, erosion, etc. as well as without installation of relevant hydro-technical&#13;
facilities. The payment for water use is introduced. There are two types of water use: general and&#13;
special. Water quality and quantity protection is given high priority.&#13;
"Forestry Code" January 23, 1993&#13;
7.            The code describes the aims and scope of forestry legislation and introduces the concept&#13;
of forest fund and forest fund lands. It is clearly stated that forests are in the exclusive property&#13;
(ownership) of the Republic, but there are also provisions for different forms of ownership of forest land&#13;
plots. Reforestation, forest protection, enhancing forest productivity and sustainable forest management&#13;
are amnong major responsibilities of the forest land owners. Vertical and horizontal levels of forest&#13;
management authority are being established in the code. Different types of forest utilization and users&#13;
are defined as well as forests are being divided into two categories. Forest which have mainly protective&#13;
functions, including watershed protection, soil and wind erosion protection, greenbelts, etc., are in the&#13;
first category. Requirements for commercial forest harvesting relationships, financing of forest sector,&#13;
conducting forest cadastre and forest monitoring are being defined in this legislation. Liabilities for&#13;
violation of forestry legislation, dispute resolution and superiority of international legislation are&#13;
established. [Payments to reimburse for losses of forest production and when forest covered lands are&#13;
taken away from their prime purpose of use are also introduced].&#13;
"Land Code" December 22, 1995&#13;
8.            The new land code defines various categories of property rights, the circumstances and&#13;
procedures for granting and transferring these rights and the role of the state in the process. Passage of&#13;
the land code is an important step in securing rights to lands and providing the framework for the&#13;
development of a land market. Land protection is considered to be one of the priorities and requires&#13;
control, monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                    Annex B&#13;
Law "On Land Reform in Kazakstan" June 28, 1991&#13;
9.            The law states the objectives and conditions for land reform and its major directions;&#13;
establishes a special land fund to be formed on the basis of unallocated land or land unsuitable for&#13;
agricultural production; determines the ways and types of privatization of agro-industrial enterprises. It&#13;
also provides for establishing rural settlements' boundaries and documentation necessary to ensure land&#13;
ownership.&#13;
"Code on Underground Resources and Processing of Mineral Raw Materials " May 30, 1992&#13;
10.           This legislation provides only for state property for underground resources including&#13;
water; defines various types of their utilization and describes institutional responsibilities in the sector;&#13;
mandates protection of underground resources and payments for their use; sets requirements for&#13;
geological prospecting, licensing, design and construction, processing, state registration system, leasing&#13;
rights; supports public participation, safety measures and protection of human health. It also provides&#13;
for expert review and analysis of relevant projects and data; enforcement and liabilities for violation of&#13;
the legislation.&#13;
Law "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-being of the Population" July 8, 1994&#13;
11.           This law is intended to further support the law "On Protection of Health of Kazakstan&#13;
People" and declares the right of the people for healthy environment. It makes prevention of negative&#13;
environmental health impacts a priority; mandates compensation for health damages and calls for greater&#13;
openness of information. It describes institutional structure as well as responsibilities and authority of&#13;
different levels of management in the sub-sector. The law mandates sanitary-epidemiological expertise&#13;
(review) and defines its goals, objects and process; public san-epid expertise (review) is also instituted.&#13;
The san-epid requirements for economic development, including project design work and construction&#13;
of different facilities; food products and use of agro-chemicals; water supply and sanitation; utilization&#13;
of wastes, and emergency situations are provided in this legislation. The law establishes administrative,&#13;
disciplinary, material and criminal liability for violation of san-epid legislation.&#13;

IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF SUB-PROJECTS FOR YEARS ONE AND Two&#13;
A. Sub-Projects for Year One&#13;
Chingeldy Joint Stock Company (Pump Station #2), Chengeldy Massif, Talgar District, Almaty&#13;
Oblast.&#13;
1.           Comprehensive reconstruction of 2,368 ha of on-farm irrigation systems and 600 ha of&#13;
new drainage for the same area on one farm. At present 150 ha are out of production because of salinity&#13;
and water logging. The system was originally constructed in 1975 and is located 40 km from&#13;
Kapchagai. Major crops are onions, vegetables and fodder crops. Water is currently pumped out of&#13;
Kapchagai Reservoir from pump station No. 2. The pump station has sufficient pressure but insufficient&#13;
discharge capacity to serve the full 2,368 ha. Proposed work includes reconstruction of the pump station&#13;
(5 pumps), partial replacement and reconstruction of the two parallel main pipelines (3.5 km / 7 krm), and&#13;
partial replacement and rehabilitation of the existing ferrocement flume distribution system. A small night&#13;
storage reservoir is being proposed. Polyethylene closed pipeline systems are to be constructed to&#13;
deliver water to the fields. It is expected that the system will remain under surface irrigation. Land&#13;
leveling will be carried out where required. Drainage works will include construction of subsurface field&#13;
drains (150 m to 200 m spacing) and closed collectors. Drainage flows will be managed using a&#13;
combination of reuse and recycling, evaporation ponds and discharge into Kapachagai Reservoir.&#13;
Kyzi-Agash JSC, Kopalskiy District, Taldy Korgan Oblast&#13;
2.           On-farm irrigation reconstruction on 1,415 ha . The system was a non-technical system&#13;
originally constructed in the mid 1960's and is located 49 km from Taldy Korgan. Major crops are&#13;
potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, and fodder crops. Water is to be diverted from the Kyzi-Agash River&#13;
at a location 10 km downstream from the newly constructed Kyzl-Agash Reservoir completed in 1990.&#13;
The diversion structure originally designed to serve 7,800 ha was started in 1991 but never completed&#13;
because of lack of funds. A 2 km inter-farm closed pipeline system (two pipes; diameter 400 mm) will&#13;
convey irrigation water. Proposed work includes upgrading the surface irrigation by replacing the&#13;
existing earth network with a closed pipe system under gravity pressure and providing hydrant turnouts&#13;
down to 15 ha. Surface drainage water is discharged into local depressions.&#13;
Verfical Drainage, Golodnaya Steppe, Makhtaral District, South Kazakstan Oblast&#13;
3.           Rehabilitation of 70 vertical drainage wells on 7,777 ha out of 43,288 ha. This area was&#13;
selected because of salinity problems. The system was originally constructed between 1968 and 1972 and&#13;
is located 40 km from Tashkent. Major crop is cotton. Average depth of wells is 60 m (average drain&#13;
discharge is 40-601/s) each serving, 110 ha. Drainage return flows will average 41.2 MCM/year.&#13;
Proposed work includes replacing existing wells with new wells, including drilling of new wells,&#13;
installing piping, access roads, dismantling old wells, and providing new power lines. All drainage will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                                  Annex I&#13;
be conveyed to existing collectors and into the Arnasay depression (58 percent) and Syr Darya (42&#13;
percent).&#13;
Mirny Farm, Moledezhnyi, District Karaganda Oblast&#13;
4.            Reconstruction of 835 ha of an on-farm irrigation system and construction of new&#13;
drainage on 498 ha for a separate area which already has 50 ha of existing drainage. At present 663 ha&#13;
are out of production because of salinity and alkalinity. The system was originally constructed in 1980&#13;
and is located 90 km from Karagandar. Major crop are potatoes and fodder crops. Water is pumped from&#13;
the Irtysh-Karagandar Canal and conveyed through a closed pipe system (a maximum of 10 km) to several&#13;
booster pumps. Proposed work includes replacing the main above ground steel pipeline with buried pipe&#13;
(8.7 km), replacing the thin walled steel pipe distribution system with concrete and steel pipes, and&#13;
replacing side roll with center pivot sprinkler systems for 835 ha. Subsurface drainage works (60-100 m&#13;
spacing) are to be constructed on 448 ha, including rehabilitation of drainage on 50 ha. A closed&#13;
collector system will convey water to Kokebai and Gayazurkin Rivers.&#13;
Akkumnsky Farn (Pilot Demonstration Rotation Block #6), Dzhalagash District, Kzyl Orda Oblast&#13;
5.            A two field rice and 4 field lucerne rotation is to be introduced on 1,069 ha. This block&#13;
now has six crop turn rotation fields that rotate three rice and three lucerne crops. Original system was&#13;
constructed in 1963 and is located 60 km from Kyzl Orda. Water is diverted from the Syr Darya River&#13;
at the KyzI Orda diversion barrage into the Left Bank Main Canal and conveyed to the Akkumsky farm&#13;
turnout. Proposed irrigation works include rehabilitation and partial lining of the existing earth canal on-&#13;
farm delivery system and reconstruction of the existing on-farm collector drain system. Drains will&#13;
discharge into the North Collector Drain (Left Bank).&#13;
Pritobolsky Joint Venture Farm, Kostanay District, Kostanay Oblast&#13;
6.            Complex reconstruction of 850 ha of an existing on-farm irrigation system and 320 ha&#13;
of new drainage for the same area. At present 320 ha are out of production because of water logging.&#13;
The system was originally constructed in 1975 and is located 10 km from Kostanay. Major crop are&#13;
potatoes, vegetables, and lucerne. Water will be pumped from Tobol River directly into a closed&#13;
distribution system and conveyed a maximum distance of 8 km. Proposed work includes construction&#13;
of a stationary pump station at the Tobol River and installation of center pivot systems. Subsurface&#13;
drainage will be provide for 320 ha and a 2 km drain will convey drainage flows back to the Tobol River.&#13;
B. Sub-Projects for Year Two&#13;
Zhambyl Farm, Tashutkul Massif, Chu Distract, Dzhambyl Oblast&#13;
7.           Comprehensive reconstruction 1, 144 ha and new drainage on 654 ha of this same area.&#13;
The new works are within the boundaries of the existing irrigation system. No area is out of production&#13;
because of salinity and water logging at this time. The system was originally constructed in 1941 and&#13;
is located 10 km from Chu. Major crops are sugar beats, vegetables, melons and lucerne. Water is&#13;
diverted from the Chu River 8 km below Tashutkul Reservoir at the Tashutkul Diversion works, into&#13;
the Right side main canal (unlined; serving 3,805 ha) to one of the four on-farm turnouts which serve&#13;
Dzhambyl JSC Farm serving 654 ha. The Tashutkul Main Canal, a separate source of water diverting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                  Annex I&#13;
directly from Tashutkul Reservoir delivers water to an on-farm turnout which serves 480 ha on Dzhambyl&#13;
JSC Farm. Proposed work includes providing lining and constructing parabolic flumes for the existing&#13;
irrigation distribution system and upgrading and constructing new works to provide surface irrigation&#13;
down to 15 ha. Drainage works will include construction of 6 vertical wells up to 40 m depth, with an&#13;
average discharge of 50 I/s, and serving an area from 75 to 160 ha. and /or closed horizontal drainage.&#13;
Closed collectors will be constructed to convey the drainage flows back to the Chu and Kookiest Rivers.&#13;
Prirechny Farm, Zhanasemei District, Semei&#13;
8.            Reconstruction of an existing on-farm irrigation system on 913 ha. The system was&#13;
originally constructed in 1980 and is located 15 km from Semeipalatinsk. Major crops are potatoes and&#13;
maize. Water is pumped from the Irtysh River directly into the Prirechny on-farm canal and conveyed&#13;
a maximum of 9.5 km. Annual irrigation requirement is 4.5 MCM and diversion discharge is 1500 I/s.&#13;
Proposed works include construction of a new stationary electric pump station, a transmission line, a&#13;
small storage reservoir to serve the lower 313 ha., and replacement of existing side roll systems with&#13;
center pivots on all areas. Natural surface drainage is to the Irtysh River.&#13;
60 Years of October Farrm, Aksusky District, Paviodar Oblast&#13;
9.            Land reclamation improvement which will provide new drainage for 4,882 ha out of&#13;
5,286 ha of which 96 ha are out of production because of salinity problems and 913 ha because of&#13;
waterlogging. A working drainage system already serves 404 ha. The major crops are potatoes,&#13;
vegetables, and fodder crops. The system was constructed in 1978 and is located 79 km from Pavlodar.&#13;
Drainage return flows will average 3.64 MCM/year. The existing sprinkler irrigation system is working&#13;
satisfactorily. Subsurface drainage will be constructed. Drainage will be collected and conveyed to a&#13;
pump station (8 m, 780 I/s) and lifted into a collector drain that will convey flows 10 km to Karosol&#13;

IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
1.           To justify the investments in irrigation and drainage rehabilitation in a large number of&#13;
large-scale farming enterprises, the economic productivity of these farms have to be increased. To this&#13;
end, an Agricultural Development Component, as reflected by the proposed "Farmers' Participatory&#13;
Training and Information Services Pilot Program", has been included in the IDIP Project to intensify and&#13;
improve present agricultural production systems and facilitate even further the commercialization and&#13;
privatization of those farms which have been selected for rehabilitation of their irrigation and/or drainage&#13;
systems. Under this pilot, an embryonic extension service in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be&#13;
set up and tested through a "Farmers Information Services Desk", which will eventually reach a much&#13;
broader agricultural community through video, radio, TV, technical brochures and a 'Farmers' Weekly"&#13;
paper editions in Russian and Kazak languages.&#13;
2.           It is foreseen that after the pilot phase, a national Agricultural Services Project might be&#13;
developed, covering not only irrigated, but rainfed agriculture and rangelands management as well. Under&#13;
this follow-up project, it is anticipated that a more farmers' oriented (public and private) agricultural&#13;
research and extension services system would emerge.&#13;
3.           The main elements and base project costs of the Farmers' Participatory Training and&#13;
Information Services Pilot Program, are:&#13;
(a     Participatory Training: US$180,000;&#13;
(b)    Demonstrations: US$160,000;&#13;
(c)    Farmers' Information Services: US$470,000; and&#13;
(d)    Consultancy Services: US$1,125,000.&#13;
Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services Pilot Program&#13;
4.            The program consists of three main activities: (a) training of specific target groups, in&#13;
various agro-technical fields and commercial farm management; (b) demonstration of improved and&#13;
modern technologies to increase production, improve water use efficiencies and reduce environmental&#13;
degradation; and (c) provide relevant information through different means (pamflets, video's, radio, tv,&#13;
weekly papers) to farmers to advise them how to make their farms more productive and more sensitive&#13;
to emerging market demands.&#13;
5.            For this last aspect, a Farmers' Information Services Desk will be set up in MOA.&#13;
Participatory Training&#13;
6.            The training program and information services should be oriented towards solving farmers&#13;
problems and to facilitate the privatization and commercialization of the farms. Such training is not&#13;
currently provided by the traditional education institutes and requires therefore special training of the&#13;
trainers. Therefore the training program will start with the "Training of Trainers" from MOA, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                                   Annex J&#13;
Kazakstan Institute of Management Economics and Strategic Research (KIMEP), Universities, and other&#13;
institutes and participating individuals. A selected group of individuals, as well as the consultant's local&#13;
counterpart staff, will be trained in modern training approaches and methodologies by the project&#13;
consultants, in order to become "Facilitators" and "Trainers of other Trainers" at the same time. Under&#13;
the supervision of the Project's Implementation Unit (PIU), local technical staff and consultants of MOA&#13;
and the former Academy of Agriculture Science (AAS), now under the National Academy of Sciences,&#13;
and with the assistance of international training and farm management consultants, the necessary training&#13;
modules for the four identified target groups will be developed and used by the "Trainers" and&#13;
consultants themselves. These modules will be mainly elective short courses and to be modified when&#13;
necessary to suit the participants' needs best. Initially the primary responsibility for the quality of the&#13;
training program will be with the consultants, assisted by PIU and relevant training counterpart staff in&#13;
MOA. This responsibility, however, will be gradually transferred within two years to a more permanent&#13;
training set-up/unit within MOA .&#13;
7.            The four target groups and their specific training needs are:&#13;
(a)    National. Oblast and Raion government staff involved in the project will be&#13;
receiving the necessary basic orientation and training to implement the project&#13;
successfully and assist farms in their efforts to become more economic farm&#13;
enterprises and thereby making agricultural production more sustainable under&#13;
the prevailing conditions, and helping the process of farm restructuring;&#13;
(b)    Farm Directors and Managers of Joint-Ventures and Cooperatives in the project&#13;
will receive training specifically in commercial farm management, accounting and&#13;
agro-business and be subjected to discussions on case studies how to start their&#13;
own private business in the presently non existing agricultural inputs/outputs and&#13;
marketing services sector. This target group is considered to have the most&#13;
potential candidates for establishing such a private agricultural services sector in&#13;
Kazakstan. In some parts of the country, some farm managers are already&#13;
attempting to realize this approach by establishing national and international&#13;
market contacts and organizing the collection and transportation of wheat, milk&#13;
and onions (Chengeldy) to the prospective clients;&#13;
(c)    Technical Farm and Production Specialists, Brigade Leaders in the project will&#13;
receive extra training on the application and transfer of improved and new&#13;
technologies to farmers to increase production in sustainable ways and will be&#13;
subjected to discussions on how to establish their own private agricultural&#13;
consultancies. It is expected that members out of this target group will form the&#13;
source of specialists for the eventual private and public extension services in the&#13;
country; and&#13;
(d)    Individual Private Farmers and Farm  Workers will be the biggest group&#13;
benefitting from the participatory training. Since most individuals from this group&#13;
have mainly high school education and only limited skills as farm hands, tractor&#13;
drivers, herds men, milkers, mechanics etc. they need the broadest training in&#13;
technical crop and livestock production and basic farm management. In the short&#13;
term, they would remain dependent on the advisory services of the technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                                    Annex J&#13;
specialists and the Farmers Information Desk Services of the MOA. Eventually,&#13;
independent private farmers would emerge from this group, while others would&#13;
be quite happy to remain farm hands or otherwise. For this group, short training&#13;
courses of several weeks each would be channelled as much as possible through&#13;
existing agricultural training facilities in winter time and "on-farm" evening or&#13;
week-end classes in summer time. They would particularly benefit from the&#13;
scheduled on-farm demonstrations.&#13;
Training Courses&#13;
8.            The specific special Training Courses, number of beneficiaries and their costs for the&#13;
various groups as described above are shown in Tables 1 to 3 for three consecutive years from 1996/97&#13;
to 1998/99. These tables provide a menu of courses from which the most relevant ones will be selected&#13;
for the various different groups of beneficiaries.  It is envisaged that at the end of two years of&#13;
implementation and monitoring, the whole training program and its costs will be reviewed in a workshop&#13;
organized by the consultants (before their departure) with MOA/PIU, to include lessons learnt by that&#13;
time and to make the program more applicable to reach a larger segment of the farming communities,&#13;
specialists and agricultural entrepreneurs. This updated training program could then become part of a&#13;
possible national Agricultural Services Project. Under the IDIP project, however, it should be realized&#13;
that the three elements of training, demonstrations and information services will be totally integrated into&#13;
one approach and action plan towards the participating farmers in the project, and in coordination and&#13;
synchronization with the implementation schedule of the irrigation and drainage rehabilitation activities&#13;
in the sub-projects.&#13;
9.            The total base training costs over three years, including those for travel/transportation.&#13;
accommodation, meals, training materials and local trainers fees (US$20/day), have been calculated on&#13;
the basis of the cost estimates in Table 4, while for new training equipment an additional US$36,000 is&#13;
required. Tables 4 and 5 indicate the separate training costs per person day and the training equipment&#13;
items to be procured. However, most training activities will be carried out under the ministry's regular&#13;
training program and where possible charged to the beneficiaries, thus reducing the training costs to the&#13;
project considerably to about US$144,000. In cases where farmers are not able to pay for the special&#13;
course expenditures, the ministry will bear the extra costs under the project up to US$144,000. including&#13;
the fees for 2000 trainer-days. In total some 46,000 beneficiaries are targeted for special training under&#13;
the project. MOA would also be responsible for the provision of transport, where necessary. Under the&#13;
project, the ministry will be reimbursed by the Bank for the above mentioned extra costs on the basis of&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), while the procurement of additional training equipment will be done&#13;
locally by PIU on the advise of the consultants.&#13;
Demonstrations&#13;
10.           As part of the technical training and to increase production, new and improved local crop&#13;
production technologies for major crops (cereals, sugarbeet, onion, maize, sunflower or other oilcrop,&#13;
potato) will be demonstrated in selected sub-projects and on demonstration farms. The objective of the&#13;
demonstrations is to teach farmers to evaluate improved practices/machineries and become more self&#13;
reliant and commercially oriented. These demo's would make use of special equipment (local improved&#13;
and imported) already introduced and (partly) fabricated by the private sector in some parts of the&#13;
country, including the use of the latest generation of fuel efficient 4WD tractors. In some cases, private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                  Annex J&#13;
companies might be invited to demonstrate new production technologies. It is estimated that some 50&#13;
demos of 10 ha each (to a total of 500 ha) will be organized over three years (e.g. 10-18-22), applying&#13;
economic optimal rates of agricultural inputs of fertilizers, seeds, agro-chemicals and fuel. Better on-farm&#13;
water management practices will also be demonstrated, including some improved sprinkler components.&#13;
Table 6 shows the estimated base costs of production inputs per ha for various crops, which vary from&#13;
US$1 10/ha for cereals to US$2,275/ha for potatoes. Assuming that the onion and potato demonstrations&#13;
will be carried out on a much more limited scale as compared to the other crops, the average base costs&#13;
of production inputs per demonstration of 10 ha is estimated at US$3,200 or some US$160,000 for 50&#13;
demonstrations over 3 years. Where justified, demo's can be smaller or larger than 10 ha. Extra financial&#13;
benefits to the farms, as a result of the demonstrations, will be ploughed back and used by the farms&#13;
themselves for further adoption of the technology in the subsequent years' and to gradually buy the&#13;
recommended equipment and crop production inputs.&#13;
11.          The demonstration plan for each year indicating what type of demo and how many will&#13;
be where executed, will be drafted and monitored by the consultants and training team, together with&#13;
PIU. These plans will be developed in consultation with the sub-project Farm Boards and WUAs, who&#13;
will then execute the demo's themselves as much as they are able to do. In other cases, some farms may&#13;
need more direct assistance from the consultants and MOA to set up a viable demo. PIU/MOA,&#13;
however, will remain responsible for making available the necessary demo equipment and for the&#13;
procurement of the necessary production inputs as recommended by the team. The consultants will also&#13;
be responsible to organize "Farmers Field Days" on the demonstration sites in consultation with the&#13;
farmers concerned and those nearby. These field days should be held at least once per cropping season&#13;
at the most appropriate time to maximize the demonstration effect of the practices recommended and&#13;
shown. At these field days, the demo's will be evaluated in comparison with existing practices and&#13;
analyzed for their cost-benefit ratios. New successful practices should be widely publicized by MOA's&#13;
Farmers Information Services Desk through the common news media and "Farmers' Weekly" news paper&#13;
editions for broader adoption. Farm demo production inputs will be procured through prudent local or&#13;
international shopping.&#13;
Farmers Information Services Desk&#13;
12.          In conjunction with the training and demonstration components, there is a crucial need&#13;
for farmers' information on many agricultural issues, in particular by emerging farmers. Up till now,&#13;
however, this information has not been readily available and accessible by the smaller private farmers,&#13;
in particular information on more efficient crop and livestock production technologies, farm management&#13;
and accounting practices and market information. Most information in the past came from research&#13;
institutes directly to the farm directors and specialists, who applied the recommendations by order of the&#13;
State. However with the on-going privatization and farm restructuring, the need for broader and more&#13;
farmers' and markets' oriented information has increased considerably. To meet this need, MOA will&#13;
establish a central farmers' information services desk under the project to provide regular information&#13;
on critical agricultural issues related to production and marketing through the existing news media of TV,&#13;
radio, video, brochures and "Farmers' Weekly" paper editions.&#13;
13.          The agro-technical topics and contents (copy) for the broadcasts and papers will be&#13;
generated by the consultants and technical specialists of MOA and staff of agricultural research institutes,&#13;
who will pass it on to the newly established Information Services Desk and the MOA Press Center. This&#13;
center has already experience in providing TV and Radio broadcasting to farmers and is very eager to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

participate in the Project. It also prepares press releases on behalf of MOA. Under the project, page space&#13;
will be bought for the "Farmers' Weekly" edition on a weekly basis for three years from the two (poorly)&#13;
existing private agricultural papers "Selskaya Nov" (Rus.) and "Auyl" (Kaz.), which are now sold in&#13;
only limited numbers (resp. 18,000 and 3,000 copies/week). It is foreseen to distribute these papers to&#13;
all agricultural education schools as well to be used as training material. Eventually sufficient agricultural&#13;
information will be readily available to farmers so that these papers do not need direct support from MOA&#13;
any longer but take over the full responsibility of publishing all the demanded farmers' information&#13;
themselves.&#13;
14.           Under this component special equipment (estimated at US$30,000) is required to upgrade&#13;
the present MOA Press Center's facilities, including those for the preparation of video's and technical&#13;
bulletins. Table 7 shows the breakdown of requirements and base costs to a total of US$470,000 over&#13;
three years. Training videos will be prepared locally, reflecting the basic thrust of the training program&#13;
and broadcasted through MOA's regular agricultural transmission hours. The procurement of all the&#13;
equipment and materials will be carried out through Local Competitive Bidding procedures by the&#13;
consultants with the assistance of PIU.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Consultants Requirement&#13;
15.           To implement the Farmers' Participatory Training and Information Services Program, the&#13;
PIU is assisted for two years by international farm management and agricultural training consultants and&#13;
local specialists or consultants. Under the project a total of US$1.1 million will be available to cover the&#13;
base costs for some 50 foreign and 250 local consultants man-months to implement the Pilot Program.&#13;
The consultants will be fully responsible for all the training, demos and technical farmers' information&#13;
services within the first two years of the project, after which the responsibility for the daily&#13;
implementation of the program is transferred to MOA and the consultants. Local specialists/consultants&#13;
may be subcontracted in consultation with PIU under Kazak salary guidelines, norms and conditions.&#13;
The foreign lead consultants will also be responsible to train their local counterpart consultants and&#13;
continue to provide their services up till the end of the second year of the project. Table 8 gives a&#13;
breakdown of the expected foreign and local technical expertise required.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
A.    Institutional Development and Training&#13;
Institutional Development and Strengthening&#13;
I .           Environmental Assessment (EA) is a process by which alternatives, environmental impacts&#13;
and costs associated with development programs or investment projects are identified, analyzed ahd&#13;
evaluated. On the basis of this analysis, monitoring and mitigation measures are usually proposed for&#13;
incorporation into the design of such programs and projects. EA is best carried out early in the planning&#13;
and design phases of development programs and projects, allowing time to make design changes and to&#13;
explore environmentally cost-effective alternatives.&#13;
2.            While project-specific EA is used to examine the environmental impacts of specific&#13;
investment projects,  sectoral EA is used in designing sector investment projects and programs,&#13;
particularly for examining investment alternatives, policy changes, and institutional aspects of a given&#13;
sector. Sectoral EA may cover some of the requirements of project-specific EA; however, projects and&#13;
sub-projects also need project specific EA to address any important issues not covered by the sector EA.&#13;
3.            Kazakstan has no previous experience in conducting either project-specific or sectoral EA&#13;
for agricultural development, including irrigation and drainage.  The country still uses the FSU&#13;
environmental, design and construction standards.&#13;
4.            The Kazakstan law "On Environmental Protection" provides the broad legal basis for State&#13;
Ecological Expertise( SEE) (review). The legal framework and practical adaptation of Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment (EIA), which should serve together with the project design as the basis for the SEE&#13;
is still not mandatory and inadequate ; in fact, it does not exist for the agricultural sector. There is a lack&#13;
of environmental institutional capacity in the MOA on the federal, oblast (provincial) and local levels as&#13;
well as lack of implementation coordination and enforcement of EIA and SEE recommendations. In the&#13;
lack of clear EIA/SEE legislation, procedures and guidelines, the MOEB fills in the gaps by issuing&#13;
directives, the applicability and validity of which are not always clear. To eliminate the shortcomings&#13;
of the existing situation, clear rules as well as institutional capacity in the sector for environmental&#13;
management, including EIA, are urgently needed.&#13;
5.            The project objectives are to: (i) support introduction of applicable legal practice of EA&#13;
(EIA/SEE) adopted in foreign countries by developing EA procedures, guidelines and manuals relevant&#13;
for the agricultural sector, and irrigation and drainage in particular; (ii) assist the MOA to build-up its&#13;
internal environmental institutional capacity on the federal level; (iii) establish and strengthen procedural&#13;
arrangements for implementation of EA (EIA/SEE); and (iv) work out procedures for cross-sectoral&#13;
coordination of implementation and enforcement of EA (EIA/SEE) requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -                                  Annex K&#13;
Training&#13;
6.            This sub-component is intended to develop and expand the professional skills and&#13;
capacities of the staff both in public and private organizations involved in implementing the project. It&#13;
will create a critical mass of well-educated environmental professionals at various levels and institutions,&#13;
who would share a common understanding and jointly contribute to the environmentally sustainable&#13;
modernization of the irrigation and drainage sub-sector.&#13;
7.            Participants in the training program will include: (i) managers, irrigation/drainage and&#13;
environmental staff, and farmers. The training' will comprise: (a) one annual course of one week&#13;
duration for national/provincial managers, irrigation/drainage and environmental technical staff. The&#13;
purpose of these courses is to upgrade existing knowledge and to introduce new concepts about&#13;
environmentally sustainable agriculture, including irrigation and drainage; (b) short courses, seminars,&#13;
and study tours to be offered by national institutions; (c) a series of one-day courses on various aspects&#13;
of irrigation and drainage such as environmental management and economics, monitoring, EIAs, water&#13;
management, maintenance, problem solving, etc.; (d) field days for farmers. These would promote&#13;
modern on-farm irrigation and drainage technologies and increase farmers awareness of environmentally&#13;
sustainable good water and integrated pest management practices. The field days will be organized by&#13;
provincial environmental coordinating units. Maximum use will be made of the pilot and research&#13;
projects, EIA and other relevant manuals.&#13;
8.            The overall design and coordination of the training and professional development program&#13;
will be under the responsibility of the PIU, which with the help of the MOA and the MOEB which could&#13;
contract for the services of established training institutions and universities in Kazakstan. A team of&#13;
international and national experts will develop the content of curriculums and training materials for the&#13;
different courses.&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA)&#13;
9.            EA, as it is known in international practice, is not generally carried out in a unified way&#13;
in the Republic of Kazakstan. The legal framework, regulating its application as well as its procedures,&#13;
are ambiguous. Consequently, the following could hinder the cooperation between the Bank and the&#13;
Republic of Kazakstan with respect to the Bank's rather extensive medium-term lending program: (i) the&#13;
lack of knowledge of internationally practiced EA procedures in general, and the Bank's EA requirements&#13;
in particular; (ii) incompatibilities between the EA procedures used by the Bank and Kazakstan regarding&#13;
classification of projects; and (iii) differences in the timing of EA in the respective project planning&#13;
cycles.&#13;
10.           For this reason, it was agreed by the Bank and the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources&#13;
(MOEB), that an Environmental Assessment Harmonization Seminar (EA Seminar) (3 days) will be&#13;
organized in Almaty with participation from the Bank, MOEB, sector ministries, Government, Parliament&#13;
MOA, and non-government organizations (NGOs).&#13;
Monitoring indicators for the training program will be developed and listed in the PIP. Details of the&#13;
training program will be prepared during the bridging operation and agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                                    Annex K&#13;
11.           The objectives of the EA Seminar are to (i) improve the understanding of the environ-&#13;
mental, economic and social issues involved in EA; (ii) provide an overview of the Bank's generic and&#13;
technical principles and procedures concerning EA; (iii) review the present legislation, regulations and&#13;
procedures of the Republic of Kazakstan to determine areas of future cooperation and assistance; (iv)&#13;
discuss ways to avoid delays in project processing in various lending sectors; and (v) carry out cross-&#13;
sectorial discussions of EA issues.&#13;
B.     Development of Water/Soil Quality Monitoring and Agro-meteorological Programs&#13;
12.           Activities to be implemented under these programs will be of importance for project&#13;
implementation and supervision and will support environmental quality monitoring, data collection and&#13;
analysis, feasibility and EIA work, project design, performance monitoring, etc.&#13;
13.           Under the current situation in Kazakstan, physical and professional capacity of agricultural&#13;
and environmental agencies is deteriorating fast. Relevant agencies are suffering from under-funding and&#13;
under-staffing. Therefore, considerable strengthening effort is urgently required. This will be achieved&#13;
through staff training, as described above, and operational support such as for laboratory and electronic&#13;
equipment, vehicles and chemicals for analysis.&#13;
14.           It is also of great importance to evaluate current environmental monitoring programs&#13;
(surface and ground water, soil, etc.), management systems, standards and methods used for&#13;
enviromnental analysis and their relevance for the project, and provide advice for necessary adjustments.&#13;
15.           Implementation of this program will substantially increase the responsibilities and the&#13;
work-load of the offices of the agricultural and environmental agencies involved. Although the Bank&#13;
would not finance all related costs, a review of the work program would be undertaken during the&#13;
bridging period. Any new tasks may require additional qualified staff and funds, including salaries,&#13;
travel, operation and maintenance, and office supplies. Government's commitment will be sought that&#13;
the necessary budget allocations will be made available.&#13;
16.           Activities under this sub-component will also require: (i) strengthening and coordination&#13;
of cost-effective regional water/soil quality monitoring systems and establishment of new monitoring&#13;
stations or field sampling where necessary; (ii) Provisions of four different types of equipment: (a)&#13;
equipment for agro-meteorological, and soil/water chemical analyses; (b) electronic equipment, such as&#13;
computers, plotters, printers, copiers, fax machines, etc.--this equipment is required for data processing&#13;
and management, calculation, mapping and report writing; (c) vehicles, i.e. pick-ups, or jeeps for use&#13;
in the field; and (d) spare parts and chemicals for laboratory analysis; and (iii) training of personnel in&#13;
calibration of equipment, sampling techniques, and standardized methods for data collection, analysis on&#13;
personal computers, and interpretation.&#13;
C.    ElAs Preparation and SEE Review&#13;
17.           This sub-component's objectives are to: (i) further improve EA capacity in the country&#13;
through the joint work of international and local EA experts; and (ii) conduct ElAs and SEE for the&#13;
remaining sub-projects to be implemented under IDIP, based on the approaches applied in the SEA and&#13;
two EIAs that have already been prepared, as well as the SEE recommendations thereon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                                  Annex K&#13;
18.          The World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment [Operational Directive 4.01:&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA)] requires EAs of proposed investments to improve decision making and&#13;
to help ensure that project options under consideration for Bank financing are environmentally sound and&#13;
sustainable. The EA evaluates a project's environmental impacts in its area of influence and identifies&#13;
ways of improving project design and implementation by preventing, minimizing, or compensating for&#13;
adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts.&#13;
19.           This project has been classified into EA Category "B" which requires an environmental&#13;
analysis, as its potential adverse environmental impacts are not irreversible and would not significantly&#13;
affect human populations or environmentally important areas; its activities are limited to rehabilitation&#13;
of existing irrigation and drainage systems and improvement of their operation, and mitigatory measures&#13;
can be easily designed.&#13;
20.           The Government's requirements for EA  cover two stages of incorporation of&#13;
environmental concerns into the decision making that are expressed in different terms: Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment (EIA)[or, in Russian, Otzenka Vozdeistviya na Okrujajushuiu Sredu, OVOS, which&#13;
is the responsibility of a project proponent], and State Ecological Expertise (SEE)[or, in Russian,&#13;
Gosudarstvennaya Ecologicheskaya Ekspertiza, which is mandatory for all investment projects, for foreign&#13;
investments in particular, and which constitutes a process of state review of the project's design together&#13;
with the EIA]. The SEE is required under the law "On Environmental Protection", while the EIA&#13;
process is instituted through a number of instructions and guidelines issued by the MOEB. The process&#13;
should also be supported by requirements stipulated in sectoral EIA guidelines.&#13;
21.           Unfortunately, the Kazakstan history of implementing and enforcing strict SEE&#13;
requirements is rather limited, while there has been no experience of conducting EIA for agricultural&#13;
development projects, including irrigation and drainage.&#13;
22.          In order to overcome this situation and to build initial EA capacity in agricultural and&#13;
environmental sectors in the country, it was suggested and agreed, by MOEB and the Bank, that a team&#13;
of international and local EA experts would conduct, as part of project preparation, a Sectoral Environ-&#13;
mental Analysis (SEA) and two pilot project specific ElAs. Both the SEA and the two project specific&#13;
EIAs have been informally reviewed by MOEB and are being further improved under the PPF. This&#13;
work should form a basis for further project specific ElAs and SEEs to be accomplished through project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
D.    Support for Special Envirornental Studies&#13;
23.           The project objectives are to: (i) support implementation of appropriate water/soil quality&#13;
monitoring and agro-meteorological programs focused on the irrigation and drainage sub-sector but&#13;
limited to the scope of the project as recommended, by the SEA and further relevant analysis under the&#13;
PPF; (ii) provide continuous monitoring of the project's performance environmental indicators; and (iii)&#13;
provide a basis for planning a coordinated environmental system for the sector, that can be implemented&#13;
when the economy improves.&#13;
24.           To ensure environmentally sustainable agricultural development and effectively protect,&#13;
manage and use water, land, forests, etc., the condition of the resources (soil, water, etc.) must be&#13;
known. This condition is in constant change, so that monitoring is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                                 Annex K&#13;
25.           Kazakstan has inherited a vast environmental monitoring system, including programs,&#13;
analytical methods and standards from the FSU. One of the distinctive features of this system is that a&#13;
number of agencies are involved, through stationary data collection and field sampling. Coordination of&#13;
these programs, their methods and standards is rather poor. Another feature is that environmental&#13;
monitoring has not been specifically designed to monitor performance of agricultural activities, including&#13;
irrigation and drainage projects.&#13;
26.           Currently, Kazakstan is not able to provide adequate budgetary resources to sustain&#13;
environmental monitoring. Agencies involved in these activities are forced to significantly cut staff, pro-&#13;
grams, and the number of monitoring stations and sampling for analysis. This will affect the capabilities&#13;
in the country for sustainable agricultural development and the monitoring of environmental impacts and&#13;
changes which could occur due to implementation of IDIP.&#13;
27.           Implementation of the project will substantially increase the responsibilities and the work-&#13;
load of the concerned oblast offices of agricultural and environmental agencies while new monitoring&#13;
stations may also have to be opened. These new tasks may require additional qualified staff and funds,&#13;
including salaries, travel, costs for operation and maintenance, and office supplies. Government's&#13;
commnitment should be sought to budget any funding gaps to cover these operational expenses.&#13;

1.            This annex discusses the background and rationale for the participatory approach used&#13;
in the project, as well as the five-step consultation and decision-making mechanism that will ensure that&#13;
beneficiaries have the final say in technical and financial decisions that affect them.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.             Widespread experience throughout the world has demonstrated that actively engaging&#13;
stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries, in the design and implementation of development projects has&#13;
short-term and long-term benefits. In the short term, participation promotes ownership and speeds&#13;
implementation; over the long-term it promotes sustainability. This consideration is particularly relevant&#13;
when there are multiple stakeholders, when participating institutions have different levels involved, and&#13;
when there are new stakeholders or stakeholder roles are changing. In such cases, it is important to&#13;
include different stakeholders in appropriate ways at various states of project preparation and&#13;
implementation. In this context, stakeholders include the gamut of institutions and individual that have&#13;
an interest in the irrigation and drainage investments, from officials in different institutions to irrigation&#13;
and agricultural technicians, legal experts, contractors, owners, direct and indirect beneficiaries, non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs) and funding agencies.&#13;
3.            Currently, World Bank participation literature identifies four principal levels of&#13;
participation that vary from simple consultation with stakeholders to empowering them to make basic&#13;
decisions:&#13;
i      Information Sharing. Shareholders are informed about the process of project&#13;
preparation and the nature of the project that is emerging.&#13;
e      Consultation.  Shareholders are engaged in a two-way dialog in which their&#13;
opinions and priorities are solicited and used to define project parameters.&#13;
*      Joint Decision-Making.  Relevant stakeholders jointly make major decisions&#13;
relating to the project.&#13;
*      Empowerment.  Stakeholders (especially beneficiaries) are given primary&#13;
responsibility for major project decisions.&#13;
4.             These participation levels are cumulative: consultation involves sharing information, and&#13;
joint decision-making includes both information sharing and consultation, for example. All levels will&#13;
be utilized in the project.&#13;
5.            This project has been participatory since its inception. It started as a central government&#13;
initiative, based on information and requests generated at the oblast and district levels from agencies and&#13;
farms. Since the time the local requests were aggregated into a long-term irrigation and drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -                                   Annex P&#13;
investment plan, some of the stakeholders have changed structure, status and roles, and others have&#13;
emerged. The project itself will precipitate additional changes, the most profound of which is the&#13;
transformation of farmers from subjects to clients. Consequently, the project must take into account the&#13;
changes and lay the groundwork for future evolution.&#13;
The Project&#13;
6.            Ultimately, the project will promote the empowerment of water users on three institutional&#13;
levels: first, they will decide on the nature of onfarm investments to be made; second, they will be&#13;
involved in establishing and managing water user associations (WUAs); and third, in at least one area&#13;
they will become shareholders in an inter-farm canal management enterprise.&#13;
7.            The Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project will involve a number of different types&#13;
of stakeholders, most of whom are in the process of re-defining their roles and responsibilities, as well&#13;
as their rights. On the surface, the project will appear to be "business as usual": central, oblast and&#13;
district officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee for Water Resources will oversee a&#13;
program of investments to improve irrigation and drainage infrastructure on and between state and&#13;
collective farms, based on the work of design institutes. The visible participants, as during the previous&#13;
administration, will be the officials, design engineers, farm managers and construction enterprises.&#13;
8.            Below the surface, however, the undertaking will be anything but "business as usual"&#13;
because each institutional participant will be working within a qualitatively new framework that offers&#13;
both constraints and opportunities. The decisions and actions of each of the visible participants--officials,&#13;
engineers, farm managers and contractors--will be constrained by the participation of two new types of&#13;
stakeholders who have heretofore been rather invisible--the shareholders of former state and collective&#13;
farms and independent farms who have broken away from the former state farms. Both of the new&#13;
groups are expected to repay the cost of onfarm investments, thus they must agree to make the&#13;
investments. To gain the commitment of these new players, therefore, the visible participants will need&#13;
to inform stakeholders about the program and its intended benefits and mutual obligations; provide&#13;
options and explain the financial and O&amp;M implications of each; prepare detailed designs according to&#13;
their wishes; ensure that the work is complete as promised at the specified cost; and prepare them to&#13;
assume responsibility for subsequent operations and maintenance.&#13;
9.            This decision-making process may take more time than a process that only involves the&#13;
visible stakeholders, and it may result in the adoption of the most conservative, least-expensive&#13;
technologies, despite recommendations of officials and technical experts. On the other hand, the process&#13;
may lead to the adoption of new irrigation and drainage approaches to deal with innovative cropping and&#13;
management patterns that are designed to increase the financial prospects of the farms under new&#13;
economic circumstances, patterns that are more imaginative, far-sighted and pragmatic than those&#13;
promoted by the agricultural officials who are used to setting policies and programs.&#13;
Participation Rationale&#13;
10.           The most important element of the project's participatory approach is a 5-step consultation&#13;
and decision-making process that will require project staff to interact with independent farmers and farm&#13;
shareholders on each farm at five specific stages in the rehabilitation and improvement process. The&#13;
objective of the 5-step process is to empower beneficiaries to be actively involved in making decisions&#13;
that affect them and to prepare them to assume obligations inherent in their decisions. The overall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -                                  Annex P&#13;
program reflects currently acknowledged best practices in the sector, with specific elements added to deal&#13;
with Kazak circumstances, prompted by findings of the project social assessment.&#13;
11.           Through interviews with managers of over 30 farms, household surveys on 10 farms and&#13;
focus group discussions on 5 farms, the social assessment concluded the following:&#13;
*      farmers appear to be poorly informed about the privatization process in general,&#13;
as well as their specific rights and responsibilities regarding farm management,&#13;
ownership and their ability to liquidate their own shares; indeed, many on&#13;
privatized farms do not know they have been privatized and others on farms that&#13;
still remain under state control believe that they have been privatized.&#13;
*      farm managers are somewhat better informed about the privatization process and&#13;
the implications of the management form adopted on their particular farms, but&#13;
they know little about alternatives and they still find themselves subject to formal&#13;
and informal orders issued by district and oblast officials.&#13;
*      farm management structures appear to be evolving, tending toward restructuring&#13;
to some degree, at least; most of the sampled farms that were privatized 2 or 3&#13;
years ago, have changed management pattern at least once, and most have spun&#13;
off one or more independent farm units.&#13;
=      farm managers appear to make most farm-level decisions, but they seem no&#13;
longer to have the final word on all decisions; ultimately, they report to the&#13;
general assembly of shareholders who can replace them and, with increasing&#13;
frequency, do so. The latitude of decision-making by managers is somewhat&#13;
ambiguous, however; managers feel hand-tied and farmers feel powerless&#13;
because the decision-making process is neither transparent nor consistent.&#13;
*      farmers increasingly question the motives of farm managers, and do not trust&#13;
them to make financial commitments on their behalf.&#13;
*      neither farmers nor farm managers appear to understand the ownership status of&#13;
the irrigation infrastructure, and the implications of ownership for concomitant&#13;
operation and maintenance responsibilities.&#13;
*      independent farmers feel themselves to be marginalized in many ways, but&#13;
particularly with regard to irrigation water, to which they feel that their access&#13;
is irregularly and arbitrarily granted.&#13;
*      for the most part, farmers are unaware of their right to withdraw from former&#13;
state farms and turn their land use entitlements into specific plots; in some cases,&#13;
the right is not recognized by farm the bylaws of the new management entity.&#13;
12.           Given the need to increase the quantity and quality of information available to farmers&#13;
and farm managers, to increase the level of trust on the major farms, to narrow the growing rifts between&#13;
the management of major farms and the independent farms, to deal with the uncertain tenure of farm&#13;
managers, and to reflect the vested interests of both independent farmers and farm members, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                                    Annex P&#13;
essential to entrust the decision to participate in the project to all farmers, rather than farm managers.&#13;
Moreover, project related decisions need to be taken in an iterative fashion at several stages in the&#13;
rehabilitation process. The 5-step process was designed to meet these needs.&#13;
The Five-Step Process&#13;
13 .          The participatory framework for major project decisions focuses on 5 discrete steps design&#13;
and implementation that require informed decision-making and/or consent. At each step, a project&#13;
delegation will go to each farm to meet with the general assembly of farm members and all independent&#13;
farmers on the former state farm property to explain the decision(s) to be made, present alternatives, if&#13;
appropriate, explore implications and answer questions. Although the initial plan is to conduct one&#13;
meeting at each stage, experience will determine if one meeting is adequate or if each decision should&#13;
have a two-stage (information meeting, followed by decision meeting) meeting sequence. At each step,&#13;
the meeting must produce a document that identifies participants; records discussion topics and various&#13;
positions and questions; records the votes on decisions; as relevant, reiterates previous commnitments and&#13;
participation requirements; and acknowledges the future commitments implied by the current decisions,&#13;
particularly regarding cost recovery and O&amp;M. The 5 steps are as follows:&#13;
14.            Step I: Initiation. The first step is a consultation meeting in which project staff describe&#13;
the project, participation requirements and limitations, the sequence of events, residual responsibilities&#13;
and cost recovery mechanisms.  Farmers and farm  management assure compliance with project&#13;
requirements, particularly the easy exit clause in bylaws or outline steps that will be taken to assure&#13;
compliance and identify priority areas for intervention and/or choice of technology. Note: this step will&#13;
apply to the second set of projects, not the first set that were included in the project appraisal list for year&#13;
I and year 11 projects, as they have already progressed beyond this stage.&#13;
15.            Step I1: Fixing the Package.  At the second step, project design staff will present&#13;
alternative packages of interventions that respond to the priorities expressed in step 1, describing the&#13;
nature of each, their estimated cost and operations and maintenance implications, as well as the cost&#13;
recovery burden that each would impose. At the end of the step, farmers will report specific choices and&#13;
reiterate their understanding of the estimated cost, cost recovery estimates, and the operations and&#13;
mainteniance implications of the choice. A Letter of Intent would be signed by farmers' representatives,&#13;
indicating their agreement, in principle, to a specific project design, related costs and repayment terms.&#13;
16.            Step III: Final Design. The third step will be a detailed presentation of the final design,&#13;
along with more detailed cost,  cost recovery and O&amp;M  implications. At the conclusion, farmers will&#13;
consent to the design or specify modifications to be made, and reiterate their understanding of the cost&#13;
and O&amp;M implications. If the farmers agree, a formal Letter of Agreement will be signed.&#13;
17.           Step IV: Tendering. At the fourth step, farmers will be informed about the tendering&#13;
process and either agree or disagree to the timing, cost and sequence of events, specifying parameters&#13;
within which changes can be made without requiring additional consultation and approval by the general&#13;
assembly. If the tender cost is too high, farmers have the option to terminate the process at this point.&#13;
18.           Step V: Performance Testing. At the conclusion of construction, before the work is&#13;
handed over to the farmers and the final payment is made, farmers must participate in a performance test&#13;
to determine the extent to which construction meets design and performance specifications.  Any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -                                   Annex P&#13;
differences between specifications and actual measurements must be identified and agreement must be&#13;
reached regarding how to handle them--ignore them, modify O&amp;M parameters or require remedial work.&#13;
The report of the exercise details the issues and decisions, as well as responsibility and timetable, both&#13;
for the works and the concomitant cost recovery and O&amp;M responsibilities. At the conclusion of this&#13;
exercise, the designer will present an O&amp;M manual that is satisfactory to the farmers.&#13;
19.           This 5-step process will institutionalize new roles and responsibilities for different&#13;
stakeholders. It establishes farm members and independent farners as irrigation clients, rather than&#13;
subjects; it relegates farm managers to technical and advisory roles, rather than decision-making roles;&#13;
it recognizes the rights and responsibilities of independent farmers, and integrates them into the decision-&#13;
making process; it requires technical people to be patient and articulate, responsible to user clients, rather&#13;
than officials; it creates broad and deep channels for the flow of information about water management,&#13;
farm management and technologies for each; and it provides the form for developing new working&#13;
partnerships between independent farmers, farm members and officials, based on common interests,&#13;
differences and interdependencies. In effect, the 5-step process will ensure that farmers who choose to&#13;
benefit from the project have adequate voice and informed choice, based on sound technical information.&#13;
20.            Successful execution of this 5-step process will require new communications patterns&#13;
between farmers and officials and technicians which, in turn, calls for officials and technical people will&#13;
need to acquire new communications skills. They need to learn to facilitate discussions, rather than&#13;
dominate them, and they need to practice mediation and consensus building, rather than commanding&#13;
acquiescence.   The process will require both patience and discipline to carry through to the end.&#13;
Technical assistance advisors will coach and train staff in the required skills.&#13;
WUAs and Irrigation Canal Company&#13;
21.           On successively higher institutional levels, the project will also promote water user&#13;
organizations. The WUAs will bring all farmers into an institution that manages water, thereby offering&#13;
independent farmers a mechanism to protect their interests, as well as to integrate their needs into the&#13;
broader context of farm-level water management. On the canal command level, the proposed pilot canal&#13;
company will similarly offer farms and independent farmers an opportunity to manage local water&#13;
resources according to their common interests, and to ensure that the inter-farm system is operated in&#13;
response to their needs, rather than to the demands of an external bureaucracy. The arrangements for&#13;
both levels of institutions will be worked out in more detail during project implementation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
MNISTRY OF AGRICULTURE (MOA) ORGANIZATION&#13;
1.           Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) are defined&#13;
as follows:&#13;
*      The development and elaboration of concepts and perspectives for the various&#13;
aspects of agricultural production.&#13;
*      Implementation of the State program for the development of the agro-industrial&#13;
complex and the investment policy for agriculture.&#13;
*      Promoting the rational use of farm lands.&#13;
v      Registration and management of the Land Fund.&#13;
*      Proposing and administering environmental legislation in the agricultural sector.&#13;
2.            Organization. The Ministry of Agriculture was established by a resolution of the Cabinet&#13;
of Ministers. There are 16 subdivisions and about 40 lower divisions in MOA throughout the Republic.&#13;
In addition, also under the mantle of MOA, there are regional and district agricultural agencies, funded&#13;
by local budgets, union associations, and numerous related but independent organizations. A general&#13;
organization chart of the MOA and related organizations functioning in agricultural water management&#13;
is presented in the attached Table.&#13;
3.           It maintains an Environmental Department, which is charged with developing and&#13;
recommending measures for the protection of land resources.&#13;
4.            Capability.  During the period of transition to a market economy, all institutions&#13;
dependent for funding on the Treasury of the Republic have undergone severe financial restrictions, which&#13;
have negatively affected their ability to meet their primary and secondary responsibilities. In the case&#13;
of the MOA, priorities have dictated the continuance of direct support for agriculture, but research work&#13;
formerly carried out by its scientific institutions and agro-chemical laboratories has essentially stopped&#13;
and some facilities have been shut down. The remediation of environmental problems resulting from past&#13;
agricultural activities has been nonexistent, since this sort of problem is well down on the list of&#13;
priorities. Even the issuance of information bulletins and catalogues of statistical information has been&#13;
severely curtailed.&#13;
5.            The ministry has no section dedicated to the analysis and management of the&#13;
environmental effects of new projects.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
MINISTRY OF ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES (MOEB) ORGANIZATION&#13;
Responsibilities. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources (MOEB) was&#13;
established by Presidential Degree No. N 679, 16 March 1992 and a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers,&#13;
No. N 216, 11 March 1992. It is the successor to the State Committee on Ecology and Nature Use and&#13;
the Ministry of Forestry. It is a planning, management, and monitoring agency mandated to promote the&#13;
protection and rational use of natural resources. It has the following functions:&#13;
*     pursuing unified State policy in respect of environmental protection, regulating&#13;
rational nature use and conservation and reproduction of natural resources.&#13;
*     organizing and implementing of State control in the area of environmental protec-&#13;
tion and rational nature use in accordance with the Law "On Natural Environ-&#13;
ment Protection in the Kazak SSR".&#13;
=     adopting measures stipulated by the Law for remediation and improvement of&#13;
ecological situation, living conditions, preserving ecosystems, landscapes, and&#13;
other environmental facilities in the territory of Kazakstan.&#13;
*     developing of long-term state complex and special programs, indicative plans on&#13;
environmental protection and rational natural resources use.&#13;
developing, implementing and improving of economic mechanism for nature use.&#13;
*     implementing State Ecological Expertise of projects, standards, projections, pre-&#13;
planning, and project documentation.&#13;
coordinating of study and control over radio-ecological situation in the Republic,&#13;
organizing collection, processing, transportation, and disposal of radioactive&#13;
waste.&#13;
*     organizing of ecological knowledge dissemination within the society, encouraging&#13;
citizens' awareness and activity for environmental protection and resources&#13;
conservation.&#13;
*     providing scientific, methodological, and organizational guidance for rational&#13;
bio-resources use and environmental activities in the Republic.&#13;
*     maintaining international cooperation in the field of environmental protection.&#13;
2.           Organization. The Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources has a vertical structure,&#13;
with divisions at the national, oblast, and district levels. It has divisions for ecological inspection,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -                                  Annex T&#13;
wildlife protection, fisheries management, scientific research. The total staff of the ministry at the&#13;
national level numbers around 100 persons. The oblast offices contain 25 to 50 persons each, district&#13;
offices 3 to 5, and city offices 10 to 15. The ministry manages seven national parks.&#13;
3.            Capability. The MOEB is a relatively young organization and as such has had little time&#13;
to chalk up real accomplishments. It inherited some capable staff from its predecessor agencies, with&#13;
considerable knowledge of the resources for which the ministry is responsible. Like its sister agencies,&#13;
it depends on the national treasury for funding and is severely curtailed in all aspects of its mission.&#13;
4.            The ministry has undergone four reorganizations since its founding. The acquisition of&#13;
trained specialists for most divisions remains a problem, and is likely to continue until the economy&#13;
improved; then it is likely to lag behind some other line agencies. Laboratory facilities are reported to&#13;
be antiquated and ill-equipped, hindering the accomplishment of basic data gathering and enforcement.&#13;
State Ecological Expertise ( SEE )&#13;
5.            The law "On Environmental Protection" has provided for mandatory SEE prior to making&#13;
any development decision; public and private financing of a project could start only after obtaining a&#13;
positive conclusion of SEE. Supportive implementation guidelines and requirements are provided in a&#13;
number of Government resolutions and MOEB instructions. All development programs, plans, project&#13;
designs, rehabilitation and improvement projects together with environmental impact assessments are&#13;
subject to SEE. All projects with foreign investments are subject to SEE at the national level.&#13;
6.            MOEB Main Department for SEE and Radiological Safety is responsible for normative&#13;
requirements and guidelines for EIA and SEE. The department has about 25 regular high level and&#13;
technical staff and also contracts external experts to conduct SEE. Each MOEB oblast committee has a&#13;
SEE unit with 3-5 staff in it and they serve both municipalities and rural areas. It is the Government&#13;
resolution which provided for payments for conducting SEE by a projects proponent&#13;
State Ecological Inspection ( SEI )&#13;
7.                   SEI is a organizational entity within MOEB with the prime responsibility for state&#13;
environmental control to ensure compliance with existing legislation, standards, requirements and&#13;
conclusions of SEE. SEI issues licenses and permit for use of natural resources, disposal of industrial,&#13;
municipal and other wastes, emissions and discharges of pollutants. It assesses fees and fines for use of&#13;
natural resources and for pollution of the environment, as well as clears on behalf of MOEB permits for&#13;
special surface and underground water use, importing of agro-chemicals, etc. SEI controls: handling,&#13;
storage, transportation, use, distribution, etc. of pesticides, herbicides and other agro-chemicals; ensures&#13;
compliance with national environmental legislation in order to prevent pollution. It also controls&#13;
compliance with water legislation and appropriate operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage&#13;
systems&#13;
8.            National office of SEI has about 20 people grouped into four divisions and there are SEI&#13;
units in all 19 oblast committees of MOEB with total staff of about 350. SEI also runs a number of&#13;
analytical laboratories.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AN) DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Annex&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.           Quantifiable benefits for the analysis are derived primarily from increases in agricultural&#13;
production due to: (i) increased efficiency in water use through improved water delivery and irrigation&#13;
practices; (ii) reversing the declines in yields from water logging and salinity build-up through improved&#13;
drainage; (iii) expanded area cultivated through reclamation of some abandoned areas; and (iv) higher&#13;
agricultural productivity as a result of farmers honing water management skills, adopting improved&#13;
cultural practices, and switching to improved varieties and higher value crops.&#13;
2.            Yield. For the with-out project conditions used in the analysis are assumed to equal the&#13;
average for the three years, pre-independence period 1988-1990. Yields since independence have&#13;
declined significantly since this period due to the protracted economic crisis that has affected input use,&#13;
fuel supplies and equipment availability. However, broad-based reforms are now underway and for the&#13;
analysis, it is assumed that by the time the first sub-projects are completed yield levels for the entire&#13;
sector will return to their historical high levels (Table 1).&#13;
3.            For the with-project scenario two different sets of assumptions were used:&#13;
*     (Comnprehensive On-farm Imgation and Drainage (seven sub-projects). Yields&#13;
are expected to increase by between 20-100 percent depending on the crop and&#13;
climatic and agronomic conditions in the areas where each sub-project is located.&#13;
Most yield increases are in the 40-60 percent range in the areas where sub-&#13;
project is located. The with-project assumptions are based on yield assumptions&#13;
used in original government feasibility studies which drew on data from research&#13;
farms. These data were then vetted and adjusted during preparation by a team&#13;
of local and international agronomists. The resulting yields are well below what&#13;
is considered to be technically feasible and what is achieved under similar&#13;
conditions elsewhere in the world. It is assumed that full yields in the with-&#13;
project situation would be achieved in the fifth year, starting from with-out&#13;
project yields in year one. To test for sensitivity to yield assumptions, rates of&#13;
return for the seven sub-projects involving comprehensive rehabilitation and&#13;
drainage were also calculated with yields at full development that were 25&#13;
percent lower than in the base case (Table 1).&#13;

*      On-Farm  Drainage Works (two  sub-projects).  Incremental production is&#13;
expected from two sources. First, without the investment in drainage, yields&#13;
would decrease due to increased salinity and water logging. The gradual build-&#13;
up in salinity could eventually reduce yields to zero. For the analysis it was&#13;
assumed that the without project yields would decline by one percent per annum&#13;
over a ten year period and stabilize thereafter. Second, with improved drainage,&#13;
yield increases could be anticipated.  With-project yields were assumed to&#13;
increase from 10 to 20 percent depending on the crop over the first five years.&#13;
4.            Area Under Irrigation. The project is limited to rehabilitation of existing irrigated areas&#13;
so that the area under the with-project assumptions does not include any expansion to newly irrigated&#13;
areas. However, several sub-projects will involve reclamation of some lands, abandoned because of&#13;
salinity and/or water-logging. In total about 2200 ha's are expected to be reclaimed (Table 2).&#13;
5.            Cropping Patterns.  Cropping patterns in the with-project scenario were originally&#13;
developed by local agronomists based on existing cropping patterns, agronomic practices, and crop-&#13;
rotation practices.  These assumptions were reviewed by consultant agronomists during project&#13;
preparation. Cropping patterns in both the with and with-out cases include considerable amounts of&#13;
fodder crops. The sub-projects farms have been traditionally mixed livestock and crop operations. This&#13;
mixed pattern of production is assumed for the analysis to be maintained. Also, fodder crops figure&#13;
prominently in crop rotation patterns.  No attempt has been made in constructing with-projects&#13;
assumptions to anticipate changes in cropping patterns in response to emerging market signals. However,&#13;
an optimization procedure was conducted for one of the sub-projects and the results suggested that the&#13;
assumed cropping pattern may indeed be sub-optimal.&#13;
6.            Prices. The prices used in the economic analysis are summarized in Table 3. The&#13;
monetary unit for the analysis is the US dollar. Wheat, rice and cotton are export crops and the relevant&#13;
price is world market price adjusted for transport to Russian markets. Sunflower, soybeans, and sugar&#13;
beets are import substitutes and the relevant prices is the import parity price. Kazakstan is a traditional&#13;
exporter of meat and dairy products and the value of fodder crops (barley, sorghum, maize, silage, and&#13;
alfalfa) is based on the calculation of estimated net returns to feeding sheep, beef cattle, and dairy&#13;
cows.  The value of livestock products used to estimate the price of fodder units are based on&#13;
international market price. Each of the fodder crops is converted into fodder units using appropriate feed&#13;
conversion ratios. Farm gate prices for tradable commodities were derived by using the World Bank&#13;
projections for year 2000 in 1990 constant price, using the G-5 Manufacturing Unit Value Indices for&#13;
inflation adjustment.&#13;
7.            Non-traded goods in the analysis are assumed to include all the fruit and vegetable crops.&#13;
Prices for the non-traded commodities were updated using the 1995 prices from local markets. The&#13;
prices of non-tradeable goods and services in Kazakstan are expected to increase significantly in the&#13;
medium term relative to internationally traded goods to correct for the substantial undervaluation of the&#13;
real exchange rate of the tenge. The magnitude and timing of the correction is uncertain. For planning&#13;
purposes and for the economic and financial projections, it is assumed that local costs and prices will&#13;
increase at a rate of 15 percent per annum over the project implementation period relative to the increases&#13;
in foreign costs of importable goods and services. Since the analysis focuses on project starts in the next&#13;
two years and since project construction for each sub-project is expected to take two to three years, all&#13;
local prices have been adjusted from 1995 levels to the year 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138 -                                  Annex W&#13;
8.            Given the considerable uncertainty attached to these assumptions, sensitivity analysis was&#13;
undertaken to test for changes in price levels for local commodities. In the analysis, it was assumed the&#13;
prices of non-traded fruits and vegetables would rise faster than the prices of traded goods. It is possible&#13;
that because of the relative price changes, commodities such as fruits and vegetables that are now not&#13;
traded could potentially become traded. It is also possible that a production response to higher prices&#13;
could dampen domestic price increases. To test for such uncertainty, prices of non-traded fruits and&#13;
vegetables were held constant at their 1995 level while local investment costs were inflated at 15 percent&#13;
per annum throughout the investment period.&#13;
9.            Economic Analysis. Summary tables showing the economic analysis for two sub-projects&#13;
are presented below (Tables 4-6). More detailed tables for all sub-projects are available in project files.&#13;
The calculation of the combined ERR for all eleven sub-projects is shown in Table 7.&#13;
10.           FinancialAnalysis. Assumptions used in calculating the FRR include: (i) financial prices&#13;
for output are assumed to be equal to economic prices; (ii) investment costs are adjusted by including&#13;
value-added tax and import duties to the economic investment costs and subtracting out costs of the&#13;
agricultural component allocated to each sub-project; and (iii) price of purchased inputs are adjusted to&#13;
include VAT and import duties.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.           This report has been prepared at the request of the Government of Kazakstan as part of&#13;
the environmental program of the Kazakstan Irrigation and Land Reclamation Project in preparation to&#13;
meet environmental assessment requirements of Kazakstan and the World Bank. It is intended to evaluate&#13;
current environmental conditions in the irrigated agriculture sector of the Republic of Kazakstan and to&#13;
predict environmental benefits and mitigation of adverse effects that may be expected to result from&#13;
ongoing and proposed improvements in irrigated agriculture on as many as 24 farm systems covering&#13;
126,577 hectares.&#13;
2.            Kazakstan may be considered a steppe nation, with large areas of short-grass plains and&#13;
hills, bordered on the south by mountains. Lying near the center of the Eurasian land mass, it has a&#13;
typically continental climate, with cold, dry winters and hot dry summers. Annual precipitation (Map&#13;
3) in the agricultural lowlands varies from less than 150 mm in the extreme southwest oblast of&#13;
Manghystau, the lower Syr Darya basin, and the edge of Lake Balkhash to nearly 450 mm in the foothills&#13;
of the southern mountains and a few areas in the north and east. In a most areas, some rain falls in every&#13;
month, with greater amounts in late winter or early spring. In the far northeast of the country, the peak&#13;
tends to be later, in July or August. On average, two out of five years are considered drought years,&#13;
requiring irrigation for viable cropping. On the basis of rainfall and temperature (degree-days above I0`C&#13;
and frost-free days), the country is divided into nine agro-climatic zones, with some subdivisions.&#13;
3.           The majority of Kazakstan's rivers are contained in the closed basins of the Caspian and&#13;
Aral Seas and Lakes Balkhash and Tengiz. Only the Ob, Ishym and Tobol basins drain into the Arctic&#13;
Ocean. The largest,the Irtysh, Ural, Syr Darya, and Ili, originate in the mountain systems (the Altai,&#13;
Urals, Trans-Ili, Alatau, and Tian Shan) that border the country or are in the neighboring states. Nearly&#13;
all types of flow regimes are represented in the rivers of Kazakstan. In central and western Kazakstan&#13;
the rivers are shallow and flood in spring, but dry out in summer or are reduced to salty stretches. Many&#13;
depend largely on snow melt and flow into desert lakes that become highly saline or dry out entirely in&#13;
summer. Such rivers tend to have two periods of flooding, in spring and in late summer. With storage&#13;
reservoirs, these glacial rivers have great industrial and irrigation potential, as well as producing&#13;
hydroelectric power. In such rivers, rainfall and groundwater outflow may provide only 5 to 15 percent&#13;
of the annual discharge.&#13;
4.            Glaciers represent large reservoirs of clean fresh water. In the Republic, glaciers are&#13;
found in the Altai, Dzhungar, Terskey Alatau, Transilik and Kirghiz Alatau, and Talas Alatau.&#13;
Collectively, these mountains contain 2,724 glaciers more than 0.01 km2 in area, with a total area of&#13;
2,033 km2. They contain approximately 100 km3 of water and yield about 2 km3 (2,000 million cubic&#13;
meters) of meltwater annually with about 0.04 g/L of salts. Most glaciers are gradually melting back.&#13;
5.            Not counting the Caspian and Aral Seas, Kazakstan has 48,262 standing water bodies one&#13;
hectare or more in area. Collectively, they contain more than 190 km3 of water. The 21 largest contain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -                                  Annex X&#13;
26,886 km2 of surface area, approximately 59 percent of the standing water surface of the Republic.&#13;
Research in northern Kazakstan by the State Hydrologic Institute (St. Petersburg) showed that the&#13;
diversion of water from lakes is possible only in years with medium to high rainfall. The smaller lakes,&#13;
therefore, cannot be a guaranteed water supply for industry, cities, rural settlements, and irrigation&#13;
systems. Most lakes in Kazakstan are not suitable for drinking, and many are unsuitable for irrigation.&#13;
Less than 30 percent can be considered completely fresh (less than 1 g/L total salts), while slightly over&#13;
half are weakly saline (1-5 g/L) or moderately saline (5-25 g/L).&#13;
6.            Due to the highly irregular flow of most rivers, their development for economic uses is&#13;
only possible through streamflow regulation by storage reservoirs. Many rivers, especially the larger&#13;
ones, have been provided long-term and seasonal regulation by reservoirs and storage ponds. Large&#13;
reservoirs such as Buhtarma, which is among the largest in the world, with a capacity of 44.6 km3 and&#13;
a surface area of 5,490 kM2, were developed with advanced construction technology. In addition to their&#13;
primary objectives (water supply for industry, population centers, energy production, or irrigation) most&#13;
also are used for fish production and recreation. At present Kazakstan has 204 reservoirs, with a total&#13;
capacity of 95.5 km3 and a total area in excess of 10,000 kmn2, including 22 that provide long-term water&#13;
supply.&#13;
7.            Groundwater is more protected than surface water and is less affected by human activities.&#13;
Out of 601 identified aquifers, 556 are suitable for drinking and household water supply. The remaining&#13;
45 are not suitable for drinking but are suitable for mineral baths and other medical purposes. The&#13;
reserves of fresh and slightly mineralized groundwater could supply 42.5 million m3/da, most of which&#13;
is located in the southeast portion of the country (Taldykorgan, Almaty and Dzhambyl Oblasts).&#13;
8.            A total of 7 million m3/da of groundwater is diverted for human use, including 50.5&#13;
percent for drinking water supply, 31.5 percent for industrial needs and 18 percent for irrigation. Most&#13;
groundwater use occurs in South Kazakstan, Almaty and West Kazakstan Oblasts, especially near the&#13;
foothills and mountain depressions and around rock and sand rock massives. There are 2,200 artesian&#13;
wells with a total capacity of 1.2 million m3/da. Irrigated agriculture is among the main sources of&#13;
groundwater pollution, along with industry, mining and mineral processing, cattle breeding farms, storage&#13;
of solid and liquid wastes, and petroleum products. Agricultural pollution of ground water is most&#13;
prevalent at Taldykorgan Oblast (Karatal, Kerbulak, Alakul and Panfilov Massives) where organochlorine&#13;
and organophosphate pesticides occur at concentrations of 0.003 to 0.03 ppm (mg/L).&#13;
9.            Kazakstan also may be divided into eco-climatic zones, on the basis of natural climax&#13;
vegetation. The most frequently used classification for lowland regions recognizes forest-steppe, steppe,&#13;
arid steppe, semidesert, desert, and foothill desert.  Designated forest areas constitute only 3.7 percent&#13;
of the total area of the Republic. Some planting of trees on state land is underway, with the stated goal&#13;
of the Forest Institute the increase of area to 4.6 percent of the national area.&#13;
10.           For ecological purposes, soils may be considered in terms of eco-climatic zones. In&#13;
northern Kazakstan, the prevailing zone is forest-steppe, with gray or black highly weathered soils&#13;
characterized as Chernozem soils. In the central part of the country, covering some 30 percent of the&#13;
total area of the Republic, are soils that are dark to light chestnut in color. In the south, occupying&#13;
approximately 40 percent of the national area, are brown to gray-brown, "takyr-like" desert soils. The&#13;
content of organic matter declines from 7-8 percent in the north to 0.3-0.5 percent in the south. Gross&#13;
nitrogen and phosphorus levels drop from 0.4 and 0.12 percent to 0.01 and 0.01 percent, respectively.&#13;
Cation exchange capacity declines from 40-45 to 10-15 mg/eq/100 gm. Over the same distance, the soils&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -                                  Annex X&#13;
tend to become more alkaline, pH rising from near neutral (6.8-7.0) to moderately alkaline (7.5-8.3).&#13;
In the drier areas, the salt content of the native soil increases, leading to a vulnerability to surface salinity&#13;
problems under conditions of poor ground water management All the soils of Kazakstan are weak in the&#13;
hydrolyzed compounds of zinc, molybdenum, and cobalt, average in copper, and well provided with&#13;
manganese. In South Kazakstan, some areas show high levels of boron and/or soda-sulphate.&#13;
11.           Studies of Kazakstan soils indicate that 26 percent of the surface of the country may be&#13;
considered erosive (Borovsky, 1976). This means that slightly more than 700,000 km2 of land is&#13;
vulnerable to erosive loss. Of this area, the fraction subject to wind erosion, about 525,000 km2, is about&#13;
three times larger than that subject to water erosion, about 177,000 kmi2, as might be expected in a&#13;
country with relatively low rainfall. In the few oblasts where erosion by water predominates, the total&#13;
percentage of erosivity is not high, less than 2 percent, whereas in the drier oblasts 5-8 percent of the&#13;
area is considered vulnerable to erosion.&#13;
12.           Kazakstan has an average population density of 6.4 persons per square kilometer, making&#13;
it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. Its place at the meeting of the Slavic and&#13;
Moslem worlds has contributed to its ethnic diversity. Of the 14 ethnic/national groups represented in&#13;
the Republic, the dominant ones are Kazaks (42 percent), Russians (37 percent), Other Slavs (5 percent),&#13;
and Germans (5 percent); the remaining 11 percent is made up of a large variety of national origins.&#13;
Kazaks are the most numerous in rural areas of the southern, southwestern, and southeastern parts of the&#13;
country, while ethnic Russians make up 80 percent of the population in the northern, western, and eastern&#13;
parts. Forced resettlement of Germans occurred until 1954, largely in the rural areas of western,&#13;
northern and central Kazakstan. Uigurs are strongly represented in the southeast, especially in Almaty&#13;
and Taldykorgan Oblasts.&#13;
13.           The concept of providing an artificial water supply for agriculture dates back to ancient&#13;
times, but the quantification of irrigation requirements began officially around the beginning of this&#13;
century. In 1915, 696,000 ha of land was considered to require irrigation. By 1988 this had increased&#13;
to 2,321,000 ha. In the 1970's and 1980's there was not only an increase in the area irrigated but also&#13;
technical upgrading of existing systems: lining of earth canals to prevent seepage, land grading to improve&#13;
efficiency, mechanized application using broad-armed sprinkler systems, and the construction of closed&#13;
irrigation systems. The engineers began to include soil water salinity predictions and optimization,&#13;
analogue computation of ground water flow, and computer data treatment in planning new systems.&#13;
Predictions of water quality and environmental protection began to enter the planning in the 1990s and&#13;
in 1991 the assessment of environmental impacts became a mandatory part of the planning process.&#13;
During this era the reuse of irrigation drainage water became a requirement.&#13;
14.           Water losses through seepage, poorly designed, poorly maintained, or absent drainage&#13;
systems, and the use of high salinity water have caused severe deterioration of growing conditions on&#13;
many farms. Waterlogged and heavily salinized lands can be found in all regions of the country, although&#13;
the distribution of such conditions is irregular. Even in the northern parts of the country, deterioration&#13;
of land accounts for 5-10 percent of the area; in the southern regions the figure is 30-40 percent.&#13;
15.           Declines in the amount of total harvest and sharp declines in harvests of valuable fish&#13;
species occurred during the period of intensive development of agriculture, industry and hydroelectric&#13;
power. Consumptive water uses caused decreases in water levels, pollution, mineralization of water, and&#13;
drying of many shallow lakes that were formerly valuable fish nursery areas. A lack of fish protective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                                   Annex X&#13;
devices on some headgates and ineffective use on others resulted in losses of young fish that were carried&#13;
along with water withdrawals.&#13;
16-           The most adverse fishery impacts of irrigation were observed at the Aral-Syr Darya Basin&#13;
anid Lake Balkhash. The Aral-Syr Darya Basin has lost its industrial importance. The harvest has&#13;
decreased to one sixth of the tonnage during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Balkhash Lake harvests in&#13;
the 1960s were 16,000 tons per year, but were only 9,422 tons in 1991.&#13;
17.           Water resources of the Syr Darya basin are almost exhausted. Discharge from Chardara&#13;
reservoir on the Kyrgyzstan border is limited by channel encroachments on downstream settlements.&#13;
Thus, when water exceeding this limited capacity is available, it is diverted to evaporate in Lake&#13;
Aydarkul. a blind basin in the desert. Four additional dams in Kazakstan also do not have the capacity&#13;
to pass high flows.  During the past several years, water has not reached the mouth of the Syr Darya&#13;
river, whiclh has resulted in serious changes for delta wildlife. The delta has not flooded since 1964.&#13;
18.           Ground water in the lower Syr Darya basin regularly is found to contain residues of the&#13;
insecticides l)DT and benzene hexachloride and the herbicide 2,4-D in excess of allowable limits. A&#13;
smnall percentage (less than 0.3 percent) of foodstuffs from the same region analyzed in 1992 also&#13;
contained DDT in excess of allowable limits. The presence of these chemicals more than two decades&#13;
after their supposed removal from use is indicative of serious indifference on the part of farm managers&#13;
to the environmental and health effects of the chemicals. Frequently the chemical applied, the method&#13;
of application, or the timing is inappropriate for the target pest, but the chemical is used because it is&#13;
available where the needed one is not. The training of field agronomists has not kept up with advances&#13;
in pest control, and new chemicals often have been distributed without adequate instructions and cautions.&#13;
The UNEP notes that during the 1980s in the Aral Sea drainage, the application of pesticides in general&#13;
remained heavier than elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. In much of Kazakstan, the decline of&#13;
pesticide use in recent years has been due to shortages of funds, problems of supply, and lack of operable&#13;
equipmenit.&#13;
19.           Fortunately, there already is considerable interest on the part of the public and of&#13;
governmenit officials in the newer methods of biological or integrated pest control. The overall outlook&#13;
for Kazakstan with regard to agricultural chemicals gives cause for environmental optimism. The&#13;
remiiaining years of this century are likely to see a continuation of the present low levels of pesticide&#13;
applications, with decreasing use of the ecologically damaging chlorinated hydrocarbons as existing stock&#13;
rull out. As the economy of the country improves and foreign manufacturers begin to provide stocks of&#13;
the newer and more effective chemicals, pesticide use is likely to increase. This increase brings with it&#13;
a renewed possibility of improper use, over-application, storage risks, and increased residues in the food&#13;
of humans and livestock.&#13;
20.           Considerable concern has been shown in recent years over the incidence of human&#13;
diseases that appear to be linked to the quality of food and water consumed. The main culprits in these&#13;
cases appear to be nitrates and heavy metals (HM) derived from irrigation water through vegetables and&#13;
possibly meats.&#13;
21.           The land under full irrigation is likely to increase as a result of an expanding population,&#13;
scarcity of other inputs (pesticides, fertilizer, machinery), and failure to charge or collect full value for&#13;
the water consumed. Scarcity of other inputs has reduced agricultural production, so additional irrigation&#13;
has become one of the few options available for maintaining or increasing production. Provided that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -                                     Annex X&#13;
energy supplies remain available at reasonable cost, more irrigation is likely to be applied by sprinkler&#13;
because it makes more efficient use of the water and also produces less soil erosion than surface&#13;
irrigation.&#13;
22.            Expanded use of wastewater, especially on fodder crops, is highly likely. Kazakstan&#13;
avoids water pollution by strictly limiting discharges. Wastewater, or even reservoir water that cannot&#13;
be passed downstream, is often diverted into natural depressions to evaporate. Obviously, this practice&#13;
cannot long continue in areas that are short of water. Thus, wastewater must be applied for its best&#13;
available use. With chemical treatment to kill pathogens, sewage effluent could even be applied to&#13;
irrigate edible crops.&#13;
23.            Improved drainage, especially in areas prone to waterlogging, is a concern of very highi&#13;
priority for residents of irrigated areas. Several sites were observed where houses had to be abandonied&#13;
because the structural integrity of mud brick construction was compromised by waterlogged soils. Crop&#13;
losses due to inadequate drainage are widespread. Discharges of return flow may be directed into sinks&#13;
or rivers, into reservoirs for reuse, or into on-farm recycling. The receiving waters for return flows may&#13;
be major environmental issues.&#13;
24.            Return flows carry fertilizers and pesticides that are applied to crops. Concentrations of&#13;
these compounds will increase in the future as use of these inputs returns to, or exceeds former levels.&#13;
However, these waters are less mineralized than many waters that are in the lower reaches of many of&#13;
the river systems. Discharge of return flows into rivers could be used as part of the strategy to control&#13;
the salinization of the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash.&#13;
25.            The Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources (MOEB) is the principal agency tor&#13;
environmental protection in Kazakstan, but numerous ministries contribute to the planning, monitoring&#13;
and environmental review of this project, including the Ministry of Agriculture, the Kazak Academy of&#13;
Agricultural Sciences, the State Committee on Land Relations and Land Management, the Ministry of&#13;
Geology, the State Committee for Water Resources, the Hydrometeorological Service, and the Miinistry&#13;
of Public Health. All ministries suffer from an acute shortfall in funding, prohibiting them from carrying&#13;
out many of their basic functions.&#13;
26.            As of the end of 1994, there was no special environmental law  requiring impact&#13;
assessment for irrigation development projects. In the middle of 1994, the MOEB issued "Temporary&#13;
Instructions for the Assessment of the Ecological Impacts of Farm Development."  The "Instructions"&#13;
are still considered in force, pending the adoption of more detailed guidelines. Such guideliles were&#13;
prepared by the authors of this SEA and presented to MOEB for possible adoption. The "Instructionis"&#13;
call for a report in which available data on the resources likely to be affected by a project are analyzed&#13;
in terms of scope and intensity, so that further research can be performed as required. An environmental&#13;
assessment (EA) report is to be prepared by the project proponent and included with the feasibility report&#13;
when this is submitted to approval. The report is to provide a brief description of ecological and social&#13;
resources, and trends in agriculture. Natural resources that are especially sensitive to change should be&#13;
identified, along with potential environmental problems. The report is given public review and then&#13;
presented to Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources. MOEB reviews the EA and its comments (Stnic&#13;
Ecological Expertise) are forwarded to those considering the project for approval. Similarly, SanitafN&#13;
Expertise is carried out by the Ministry of Public Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -                                   Annex X&#13;
27.           Currently there is no entity (unit) within the national office of the Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(MOA) responsible for environmental issues in the sector, although there is an environmental specialist&#13;
in the Project Implementation Unit for this project. The MOA is responsible for self control and&#13;
monitoring of reclamation land conditions on irrigated and drainage systems within the boundaries of&#13;
state, collective and private farms.  There are three regional monitoring units called Hydrologic&#13;
Amelioration (or Hydrogeologomelioration) Expeditions under the MOA. They are responsible for&#13;
monitoring of cropped areas, irrigation water use, soil and groundwater salinity and quality, preparation&#13;
of water balance calculations and maps for all major irrigation systems in their region.&#13;
28.           Surface water monitoring for developments under this project will be carried out by.&#13;
Drainage and subsurface water monitoring will be performed by Hydrogeologymeliorative expeditions&#13;
of MOA in Almaty, Zhambyl, Kzyl-Orda, Taldy-Korgan and South Kazakhstan oblasts, and by the&#13;
Hydrometeorological Service in other oblasts. Land monitoring, as well as monitoring of agricultural&#13;
products will be made by the agricultural chemical laboratory of Joint Stock Corporation "Kunarlylyk".&#13;
They will also make plans for fertilizers application and, jointly with stations of plant protection, use of&#13;
chemicals.&#13;
29.           The project has many positive impacts, most notably a reduced use of irrigation water&#13;
as a result of increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems. Proper design and practice of irrigation and&#13;
drainage will also ameliorate soil in the fields and improve crop yields. In a simple sense, drainage&#13;
removes pollutants from soil and transfers them to groundwater, which may need to be drained away&#13;
from the fields. Quality of water to be drained from fields has been tested, and feasibility studies will&#13;
include provisions of designs to maintain water quality suitable for fish production in any natural waters&#13;
that receive drainage from sub-projects. Alternatively, drainage water of suitable quality may be reused&#13;
for irrigation of crops. Water of poorer quality may be used to water forest belts adjacent to fields. If&#13;
quality of drainage water is not sufficient for irrigation of forest belts, and it cannot be discharged into&#13;
a natural water, drainage water must be diverted to an evaporation basin. This is the least preferred&#13;
alternative, but newly created lakes may enhance regional ecology and economy.&#13;
30.           The research and design agencies of the republic have proposed plans to mitigate&#13;
environmental effects of sub-projects. The State Committee for Forestry and its forest reclamation&#13;
stations are ready to design and construct forest reclamation belts to prevent wind erosion.&#13;
"Kazmekhanobr" has proposed a method of cleaning of drainage discharge. The National Academy of&#13;
Science proposes biological reclamation of salinized irrigated areas in rice fields by composting rice&#13;
straw.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Irrigation
            and Drainage Improvement Project are to: 1) promote
            sustainable irrigated agricultural production through
            irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, improved water
            management, and better operation and maintenance; 2)
            introduce improved agricultural practices and farmers'
            information services; and 3) strengthen irrigation and
            environmental agencies. The project will include the
            following components: 1) rehabilitation of irrigation and
            drainage systems; 2) promotion of agricultural development
            on privatized farms including pilots for farmers'
            participatory training and information services as well as
            farm restructuring; and 3) institution building comprising:
            (a) support for the project implementation unit; (b)
            strengthening of environmental capacity; and (c) study of
            the feasibility of privatizing irrigation management for a
            typical canal command area.
