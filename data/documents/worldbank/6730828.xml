                                      Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
For many years, World Bank knowledge and learning pertaining to social accountability stemmed&#13;
from a handful of pioneering initiatives, such as those on participatory budgeting by the&#13;
municipality of Porto Alegre, Brazil; on budget analysis by the Institute for Democracy in South&#13;
Africa; and the report card on pro-poor services in the Philippines by the Department of Budget&#13;
and Management. Given the need for a broader investigation of social accountability approaches&#13;
and initiatives, a stocktaking exercise was launched in the Asia and Pacific region with the hope&#13;
of extending the Bank's knowledge base.&#13;
&#13;
Social accountability is an approach, initiated by either civil society or the state, to building an&#13;
accountable, transparent, and responsive government. This paper attempts to summarize the&#13;
findings of the stocktaking exercise. It does not provide a detailed description of the social&#13;
accountability initiatives, nor does it seek to provide an exhaustive conceptual analysis. Rather,&#13;
its goal is to look specifically at the tools, mechanisms, and activities that were used to improve&#13;
governments' accountability in relation to selected initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
The paper highlights a mix of forces, conditions, and motivating factors out of which some social&#13;
accountability initiatives have developed, including the concern of increased development&#13;
effectiveness, improved governance, and empowerment, particularly of the poor. It focuses on the&#13;
specific tools and mechanisms that were used to improve social accountability. While many fall&#13;
into the public expenditure management cycle, such as budget analysis, budget formulation,&#13;
budget expenditure tracking, and performance monitoring, the stocktaking found evidence of&#13;
other types of social accountability tools such as lifestyle checks, right to information, and social&#13;
audits and those involving information and communication technology. Some evidence of&#13;
evolution is also apparent in that the mechanisms and tools have been adapted to fit local context.&#13;
&#13;
Trying to understand what leads to successful social accountability initiatives is complex. As the&#13;
paper notes, one common pattern is that those initiatives that used advocacy and communication&#13;
strategies were more successful than those that did not include them. The lesson is to get out&#13;
information about the initiative and its findings. Some outcomes were documented to show the&#13;
challenges and opportunities when implementing social accountability initiatives. Efforts at&#13;
inclusion, especially in relation to the poor, were examined. The stocktaking exercise found that&#13;
inclusion varies depending on capacity development and social mobilization, access to&#13;
information and the internet, for example.&#13;
&#13;
A table that classifies social accountability mechanisms according to their main actors and&#13;
reviews what broad activities or entry points exist for them suggests possible implications for the&#13;
World Bank's work in this area. This paper concludes by asking what more can be done and what&#13;
mechanisms are lacking in the Asia and Pacific region. It suggests that there is more in the way of&#13;
uneven development of innovations as opposed to a lack of innovation development. This review&#13;
has found much synergy, complementary activity, and convergence among social accountability&#13;
groups in India and the Philippines in particular. Advocacy chains represent gains from pursuing&#13;
synergy. Different groups involved in social accountability mechanisms link together to hold the&#13;
state accountable for its services that target the poor. This learning process could not only inform&#13;
Bank strategy but also contribute to broader south-south learning.&#13;

                                            Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Accountability is the ability to require that public officials, private employers, and service&#13;
providers answer for their policies, actions, and use of funds. Social accountability is an&#13;
approach, initiated either by civil society or the state, toward building an accountable, transparent&#13;
and responsive government.&#13;
&#13;
For many years, knowledge and learning pertaining to social accountability stemmed from a&#13;
handful of pioneering initiatives, such as those on participatory budgeting by the municipality of&#13;
Porto Alegre, Brazil; on budget analysis by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa; and the&#13;
report card on pro-poor services in the Philippines by the Department of Budget and&#13;
Management. Given the need for a broader investigation of social accountability approaches and&#13;
initiatives, a team from the World Bank Institute's Community Empowerment and Social&#13;
Inclusion Learning Program and the Participation and Civic Engagement Group of the Social&#13;
Development Department of the World Bank launched a stocktaking exercise in the Asia and&#13;
Pacific region. The Philippine Center for Policy Studies at the University of the Philippines&#13;
conducted the research.&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of the stocktaking exercise were (a) to extend the knowledge base and learning&#13;
opportunities on social accountability tools and mechanisms for the World Bank and its partners,&#13;
(b) to derive generic methodologies or strategies used in social accountability initiatives, (c) to&#13;
incorporate the findings into the upcoming World Bank social accountability sourcebook in&#13;
relation to possible strategies for Bank operations, (d) to create a platform for disseminating&#13;
information on interventions and influencing the debate on social accountability, and (e) to begin&#13;
to create a network of practitioners.&#13;
&#13;
The result is a database of 54 social accountability initiatives selected from both civil society&#13;
groups and official state bodies in the Asia and Pacific region (see appendix 1 for a list of these&#13;
initiatives) and the selection of 14 initiatives for development into case studies.1 The case studies&#13;
will provide a description of the key elements of a variety of social accountability tools and&#13;
mechanisms when applied in different contexts and will examine the modifications that are&#13;
required, risks, and critical success factors. This is needed to better understand the basic elements&#13;
of different methodologies when applying them in a range of sectors and cultural contexts.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the findings of the stocktaking exercise. The paper&#13;
does not provide a detailed description of the social accountability initiatives nor does it seek to&#13;
provide an exhaustive conceptual analysis. Rather, its goal is to look specifically at the tools,&#13;
mechanisms, and activities that were used to improve governments' accountability in relation to&#13;
selected initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Methodology&#13;

&#13;
    Â·    The World Bank Institute's Community Empowerment and Social Inclusion team invited&#13;
         several practitioners of social accountability, both within and outside the World Bank, to&#13;
         serve as focal points for refining the exercise's content and process and to share their&#13;
         knowledge of social accountability initiatives in the Asia and Pacific region.&#13;
    Â·    The World Bank team designed a template for capturing and organizing information&#13;
         gathered about each social accountability initiative (see appendix 2).&#13;
    Â·    The Philippine Center for Policy Studies launched an Internet search to find potential&#13;
         candidates for the stocktaking exercise to add to those suggested by the focal points.&#13;
    Â·    The initial list of eighty initiatives was refined under the World Bank team and focal&#13;
         points' guidance so that it included a broad range of initiatives by country, types of tools&#13;
         and mechanisms, and initial outcomes.&#13;
    Â·    The Philippine Center for Policy Studies contacted the individuals involved in the&#13;
         selected social accountability initiatives, conducted interviews, and requested additional&#13;
         documents.&#13;
    Â·    The World Bank team narrowed the final list of social accountability initiatives to 54, and&#13;
         the Philippine Center for Policy Studies completed templates for each initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
The national budget is a fiscal expression of social priorities, and civic groups are involved in the&#13;
crafting of that expression. The social accountability model currently used by the World Bank&#13;
involves public participation in the budget or public expenditure cycle, whereby civil society&#13;
representatives may participate in the following four phases:&#13;
&#13;
    Â·    budget preparation and formulation, referred to as participatory budgeting;&#13;
    Â·    budget analysis, whereby the budget document prepared during the first stage of the cycle&#13;
         is given over to public scrutiny for analysis of how well it addresses social development&#13;
         concerns;&#13;
    Â·    expenditure tracking, whereby nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and/or other&#13;
         actors, such as parliamentarians, verify whether the funds allocated for particular&#13;
         programs have indeed been spent on those programs; and&#13;
    Â·    performance monitoring, at which time civil society representatives grade the final&#13;
         outputs, most commonly the performance of government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
The research for this paper began by looking at interventions in these four broad social&#13;
accountability stages with the exception of participatory budgeting, which was being examined in&#13;
a separate stocktaking by the World Bank Institute's Governance Group (Shah and Vergara&#13;
forthcoming). The Asia and Pacific region stocktaking revealed (a) that a multitude of activities,&#13;
tools, and mechanisms are involved in implementing a single social accountability initiative; and&#13;
(b) that many social accountability tools and mechanisms are used outside of the participatory&#13;
public expenditure cycle, such as social audits, citizens' charters, and e-governance.&#13;
&#13;
Whereas most previous research on social accountability mechanisms has focused on the role of&#13;
ordinary citizens and/or civil society organizations participating directly or indirectly in exacting&#13;
accountability, this stocktaking exercise found that many governments, for example, the Local&#13;
Governance Development Fund Project in Sirajganj, Bangladesh, have taken the lead in setting&#13;
up their own mechanisms to involve the public in promoting accountability. Joint state-civil&#13;
society initiatives have also been undertaken, and many governments institutionalize innovations&#13;
suggested by NGOs. Ultimately, both sides must work together.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                 Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A number of common elements bind these initiatives together. A World Bank concept paper on&#13;
social accountability (Malena 2004) notes that it encompasses an extremely broad array of actions&#13;
that citizens can potentially take to hold government officials and bureaucrats accountable. These&#13;
actions normally comprise several, and ideally all, of the following building blocks, starting with&#13;
an intervening agency, which can be either a civil society or government entity, mobilizing&#13;
around an entry point for addressing a priority problem. For example, if poor health service&#13;
delivery is the problem, the response may be to add more resources to the municipal budget. The&#13;
next building block is to build an information or evidence base that will hold public officials to&#13;
account, with the data taking the form of budget commitments, expenditure records, or similar&#13;
material. The intervening group then goes public, rallying support and building coalitions. Finally&#13;
the group works to advocate and negotiate change, pushing for reforms in programs, policies,&#13;
budgets, and laws.&#13;
&#13;
We found these kinds of building blocks in the various mechanisms reviewed across the region;&#13;
however, rather than looking at key building blocks, the process may be better seen as an&#13;
ascending stairway of social mobilization and an advocacy chain in which different groups&#13;
complement each other's interventions in pursuit of a common cause.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Context and Motivating Factors&#13;
&#13;
The initiatives in the Asia and Pacific region arise from a mix of forces, conditions, and&#13;
motivating factors. The three main motivating factors are increased development effectiveness,&#13;
improved governance, and empowerment. Social accountability contributes to increased&#13;
development effectiveness through improved public service delivery and better informed policy&#13;
design. Social accountability initiatives can also lead to empowerment, particularly of the poor&#13;
(Malena 2004). Initiatives can also be classified based on their financial, performance, and&#13;
political or democratic accountability frameworks (Brinkerhoff 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Increased Development Effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
One key concern of groups that use social accountability mechanisms is the government's budget.&#13;
A policy is only as important as the resources committed to it. If no funds are reserved for it, the&#13;
official objective is rendered meaningless. However, crafting the budget is not a mere academic&#13;
exercise, as it is subject to the interplay of political pressures. Various stakeholders within the&#13;
state maneuver to control and influence budget funds, thus the groups promote budget advocacy&#13;
and monitoring to encourage public spending that is transparent, pro-poor, and socially&#13;
responsive.&#13;
&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Countries designing their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers&#13;
use budgets to implement their priorities and programs. In such cases, the government and civic&#13;
groups examine budgets to ensure that they are indeed pro-poor. Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
Papers' processes and associated policy and program commitments have the potential to increase&#13;
the government's pro-poor focus and the accountability of policy making and budgeting through&#13;
improved availability and use of information and better incentives and processes. For example,&#13;
Cambodia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper aimed to assess the contribution of the Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategy Paper process to achieving more accountable and pro-poor budgeting&#13;
(Klugman and Alonso 2004).&#13;
&#13;
The civil society spotlight becomes more glaring when governments must struggle with fiscal&#13;
difficulties and budget cuts. The Indonesian Forum on Budget Transparency (Forum Indonesia&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
untuk Transparansi Anggaran) used budget advocacy in support of public services at the&#13;
provincial level to support poverty reduction. Action Aid Nepal has been examining the national&#13;
budget partly because of the threat of cuts in social spending. In the Philippines, Kapitbisig Laban&#13;
sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms against Poverty)--Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social&#13;
Services (KALAHI-CIDSS) is the state's flagship antipoverty program. As part of its mandate, it&#13;
trains communities to formulate budgets for their own infrastructure projects. The program's&#13;
activities include participatory prioritization and budgeting for community projects, simplified&#13;
performance report cards through community billboards and reporting in public forums and&#13;
independent grievance redress systems plus monitoring by civil society groups.&#13;
&#13;
Inefficient Public Services. Many interventions sprouted in reaction to the poor and inadequate&#13;
social services found in many cities and to the lack of access to and feedback mechanisms for&#13;
public services. For example, in India, Delhi citizens used to resort to bribing government&#13;
officials to obtain access to public services because of the lack of mechanisms for lodging&#13;
complaints with the city government. In Hyderabad, the public services were government&#13;
monopolies, thus a sense of complacency was pervasive among the staff. In Maharashtra,&#13;
agencies got away with inaccurate performance reports because the public rarely read them. As a&#13;
result of social accountability initiatives in these cities, citizens use their rights to information to&#13;
monitor performance and grievance mechanisms have been established so that citizens can&#13;
demand better access to and performance by public services.&#13;
&#13;
Even though India has a strong tradition of urban planning and analysis, the actual performance&#13;
of urban plans and services has received less attention. In addition, urban sector studies in India&#13;
rarely focus explicitly on municipal services, especially in slum areas. Housing rights, access to&#13;
land and services, construction methods, costs, and design are frequent topics of analysis, but&#13;
urban research often neglects municipal services, such as water, sanitation, street lights, and solid&#13;
waste collection, yet it is these services that account for the quality (or lack of it) of urban life for&#13;
the poor. According to a local slum dweller, "Without water, no toilets. And no toilets, no&#13;
investments in shelter" (Bhatt 1999, p. 2). The provision of feedback on service performance is&#13;
also rare, especially in a systematic manner, and it rarely comes from the poor women who&#13;
constitute 50 percent of municipal service users. For this reason, the Self-Employed Women's&#13;
Association and the Foundation for Public Interest in Ahmedabad conducted research in slum&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
Improved Governance&#13;
&#13;
Governance is the process and institutions by which authority is exercised in a country. This&#13;
includes the process whereby governments are selected, held accountable, monitored, and&#13;
replaced; the capacity of governments to manage resources efficiently and to formulate,&#13;
implement, and enforce sound policies and regulations; and the respect for institutions that govern&#13;
economic and social interactions. Good governance therefore depends on transparency,&#13;
accountability, and equality in ways that are responsive to people's needs (Kaufmann 2002).&#13;
Social accountability mechanisms have been successfully used to improve governance at the&#13;
district, provincial, state, and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
Pervasive Corruption. The morass of corruption in their respective countries drives many civic&#13;
groups in the Asia and Pacific region. For example, Bangladesh has dynamic anticorruption&#13;
groups because of the extent of corruption in that country. In her speech to the 18th session of&#13;
parliament in 2003 the prime minister voiced her despair at its sheer magnitude and said that even&#13;
the institutions created to fight corruption have become corrupt.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                 Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Corruption often takes place at the clerical level. Agency employees use their discretion to slow&#13;
down the release of papers, to deny licenses, and to impose arbitrary fees on transactions so that&#13;
they can solicit bribes. In response, the city government of Seoul in South Korea has set up a&#13;
special Web site called Online Procedures Enhancement for Civil Applications (OPEN) to handle&#13;
various transactions. When dealings are faceless and leave an electronic trail, administrative&#13;
personnel are no longer in a position to demand bribes.&#13;
&#13;
Corruption can be institutionalized among local officials, as in the case of Japan in the city of&#13;
Sendai. A handful of attorneys in the city of Sendai in mid-1990s established an independent civil&#13;
ombudsman with the express purpose of examining payments made for official entertainment&#13;
purposes as well as payments to officials for business expenses. An association of civil&#13;
ombudsmen was also established subsequently when it became apparent that the problems were&#13;
widespread and that additional public exposure was justified.&#13;
&#13;
Over a period of several years, the Ombudsmen diligently requested information and monitored&#13;
the business expenses and entertainment activities of local government officials. Some&#13;
municipalities were cooperative. Others were not. When local governments refused to provide the&#13;
information, they were taken to court and forced to divulge it. Eventually, the true picture began&#13;
to emerge and the true cost to the public, in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars. No issue is&#13;
more fundamental to citizen oversight than auditing expenditures of public funds. With the arrival&#13;
of the citizen ombudsmen, Japan's local governments would have to deal with a true third party&#13;
audit for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
Corruption can flow from pork barrel politics, as in the Philippines. In rural parts of the country,&#13;
Congress members often reward those areas that support them politically with infrastructure&#13;
projects and neglect the rest. This sort of spending undermines the objectives laid out in&#13;
development plans. Corrupt legislators collude with local public works officials in their provinces&#13;
to rig bidding so as to favor particular contractors, and the members of Congress and public&#13;
works officials get a cut of the deal in return. The Web site of the Department of Budget and&#13;
Management in the Philippines revealed such actions on the part of some legislators. The&#13;
Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism specializes in producing in-depth media reports,&#13;
often on corruption. It has published almost 200 articles in major Philippine dailies and&#13;
magazines and more than a dozen books. Its reports on graft and influence peddling in high&#13;
places have shaken the political landscape. In many cases, the center's accounts have forced the&#13;
government to act. Its investigative reports go beyond high-profile corruption cases and also look&#13;
into entrenched corrupt practices in key government departments or branches.&#13;
&#13;
Corruption can weigh a country down with financial mismanagement problems, as has occurred&#13;
in Nepal. A World Bank (2002b) economic update for the country notes that financial&#13;
management and accountability issues persist and that corruption is perceived to be widespread,&#13;
contributing to misallocations of public resources, arbitrary application of regulations governing&#13;
the private sector, delays in project implementation, rapid turnover of staff, and perverse&#13;
incentives for civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
National Crises. In Bangladesh, the 2001 school year began without textbooks because the sole&#13;
supplier failed to deliver them on time. Hence 25 million students did not have textbooks for their&#13;
high school classes, and the few books that were on hand were full of errors. After a&#13;
Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) investigation to generate feedback on the&#13;
availability of books, the textbook errors, and the quality of the books' printing and binding, the&#13;
government filed a lawsuit against the corrupt institutions that had caused the shortage.&#13;

Promotion of Democratic Values. The quality of governance in a democracy is greatly influenced&#13;
by its political institutions, processes and leaders. As a result, any improvement in the quality of&#13;
governance has to address the issue of improving the quality of electoral processes. Several ills&#13;
plaguing the Indian society have been attributed to those in power, the politicians and the&#13;
bureaucracy. On one hand, the political institutions seldom reflect the mandate of the people and&#13;
therefore lack legitimacy. On the other hand, many believe the root cause of the crisis is the&#13;
apathetic, indifferent and illiterate citizens. It is in this context that Public Affairs Centre in&#13;
Bangalore, India sought to intervene in the electoral arena to increase involvement and interest of&#13;
citizens, and to stimulate informed choices in the selection of candidates through information&#13;
disclosure, access to information, social mobilization, capacity building and advocacy.&#13;
&#13;
The Public Affairs Centre in Bangalore, India, has also been nurturing civic values among young&#13;
people through its collaboration with the NGO Swabhimana. The Centre and Swabhimana jointly&#13;
formed a children's civic movement, which performed a survey of roads in the city. The children,&#13;
who were age 12 to 14, were briefed on the need to drain water from the roads to maintain their&#13;
quality, the impediments to pedestrian and road safety, and the quality of the riding surface.&#13;
Using a checklist, they observed 300 meters of road. The children then presented their finding to&#13;
the Bangalore's municipal commissioner at a public function.&#13;
&#13;
The Public Record of Operations and Finance, also in Bangalore, focuses on financial reporting&#13;
standards, which are essential to the effective functioning of democracy. Hence it pursues&#13;
transparency in the government's financial operations through a collaborative process between&#13;
the city's stakeholders and its municipal corporation.&#13;
&#13;
The Centre for Social Development in Phnom Penh has been upholding democratic values in&#13;
Cambodia. A survey by the center revealed that young people were indifferent toward corruption.&#13;
The center responded by pushing for an anticorruption curriculum in the schools.&#13;
&#13;
Decentralization and Devolution. Nations such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,&#13;
and the Philippines have mandated decentralization by law and have employed social&#13;
accountability mechanisms to improve local governance. The Bangladesh Local Government&#13;
Development Fund Project uses performance score cards to grade public services, engages in&#13;
participatory budgeting, holds community participatory planning and budgeting sessions, and&#13;
makes information transparent via notice boards and complaint books. Local governments and&#13;
their municipal corporations adopt citizens' charters pushed by civic groups like Lok Satta in&#13;
India via resolutions and executive orders. Community Information and Epidemiological&#13;
Technologies International in Pakistan has undertaken social audits together with the National&#13;
Reconstruction Bureau, a government agency and the main architect of devolution.&#13;
&#13;
All too often, however, the transition to decentralization or devolution is fraught with difficulty.&#13;
Local governments are constrained by inadequate capacity, bureaucratic procedures, political&#13;
interference, limited authority, lack of accountability of service providers, and insufficient&#13;
financial resources. Citizens must also contend with confusion in relation to roles. According to&#13;
Vinod Vyasulu, director of the Centre for Budget and Policy Studies, "Many of the problems of&#13;
governance stem from a multiplicity of agencies--for example, the city government does not deal&#13;
with drinking water. There is separate agency for planning. The constitutional amendment&#13;
creating local self governance--the term used in the law--through devolution of power has yet to&#13;
be implemented."&#13;
&#13;
Civic groups can articulate the needs of local constituencies and hold local officials accountable.&#13;
For example, since Indonesia decentralized, power has flowed to traditional interests at the local&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                 Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
level who use this power to maintain their control over community resources. Because these&#13;
interests are traditional, they are unlikely to hear women's voices and look out for women's&#13;
interests in public forums. Indonesia's Coalition for Women therefore organizes, trains, and&#13;
empowers women through political education to advocate their issues themselves.&#13;
&#13;
The law on devolution in the Philippines provides for people's participation in Local&#13;
Development Councils (LDCs). The LDC was designed by Congress and implemented by the&#13;
Department of the Interior and Local Government. At least a quarter of council members must&#13;
come from NGOs and people's organizations. The councils help local government assemblies at&#13;
the village, municipality, city, and provincial levels set the direction of economic and social&#13;
development and review local governments' budgets. This provision of the Local Government&#13;
Code of 1991 allows NGOs, people's organizations (POs), and the private sector to directly&#13;
engage in governance by giving them a say, at the very least, on the use of official funds. Other&#13;
special bodies in which accredited NGO representatives are empowered by the Code to sit are in&#13;
the pre-qualification, bids and awards committee; the school board; the health board, the local&#13;
peace and order council, and the people's law enforcement board.&#13;
&#13;
Empowerment&#13;
&#13;
Social accountability initiatives can lead to empowerment, particularly of poor people. According&#13;
to a World Bank publication (2002a, p. 14), empowerment is defined as the expansion of poor&#13;
people's assets and their capabilities to participate in, negotiate with, influence, control, and hold&#13;
accountable institutions that affect their lives. Research shows that poor people's dissatisfaction&#13;
with government relates largely to issues of responsiveness and accountability. Therefore, by&#13;
providing critical information on rights and entitlements and soliciting feedback from poor&#13;
people, social accountability mechanisms can provide a means to increase the voice of vulnerable&#13;
and disadvantaged groups.&#13;
&#13;
Rights-Based Development. The obligation of government officials and bureaucrats to account to&#13;
citizens derives from notions of citizens' rights, information rights, and human rights. Social&#13;
accountability offers mechanisms to monitor and protect these rights. For instance, simply&#13;
disseminating information about entitlements or soliciting citizen feedback about the public&#13;
sector's performance can facilitate the fulfillment of people's rights of access to information,&#13;
food, housing, social security, education, freedom of association, speech, and so on (Malena&#13;
2004).The concept of social accountability underscores citizens' rights to expect the government&#13;
to act in the best interests of the people and to ensure that it does so.&#13;
&#13;
In Nepal and in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, NGOs focused on the lowest castes. In the&#13;
state of Maharashtra, India, bonded labor, essentially slavery, persisted in the Thane district&#13;
despite the constitution's ban on the practice and laws providing for the release of bonded&#13;
workers. The movement Samarthan arose to fight for such marginalized groups as scheduled&#13;
castes, women, children, and tribal groups. In particular, Samarthan focused on the rights of the&#13;
child laborers, noting that they were being excluded from formal health and education services.&#13;
&#13;
The benefits of globalization have bypassed some sectors. The Indian state of Tamil Nadu is one&#13;
of the most urbanized and industrialized in the country; however, the gains of development have&#13;
been unevenly distributed. Indicators of poverty, inequality, and rural-urban disparities showed&#13;
that the lowest-caste individuals, indigenous peoples, fishermen, unorganized labor, and some&#13;
groups of women and children had hardly benefited at all from the state's development. In&#13;
response, the Tamil Nadu People's Forum for Social Development was established. The forum&#13;
noted that liberalization and structural adjustment programs had led to budget cuts in key areas of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
social development and that henceforth it would monitor and analyze the state's budget and its&#13;
impact on social spending. To this end, the forum conducted budget analysis and lobbied&#13;
members of the Tamil Nadu State Assembly before and during budget deliberations.&#13;
&#13;
In Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Governance Studies focused on women's housing needs.&#13;
Some 4.4 million families in the archipelago did not own their houses, but the housing problems&#13;
of the poor were not gender neutral: slum areas tended to have more women residents than men,&#13;
but because of the culture, public housing officials did not take women into account when&#13;
allocating public housing. The institute has therefore carried out a survey to probe into housing&#13;
budget policy and housing needs in relation to gender and is developing a tool to measure gender&#13;
sensitivity in housing policy and budget allocations.&#13;
&#13;
In the Republic of Korea, officials were generally unaware of gender issues and no evaluation&#13;
system pertaining to the implementation of policies related to women's issues existed. The budget&#13;
for women's concerns accounted for only 0.003 percent of the general account. In response,&#13;
Women's Link of Korea, an NGO serving Seoul and a few provinces, carried out a gender budget&#13;
analysis of seven local governments.&#13;
&#13;
In the Marshall Islands, a participatory public expenditure tracking project for women noted the&#13;
following women's issues: high rates of malnutrition, high dropout rates among schoolgirls, teen&#13;
pregnancies, and spousal and child abuse.&#13;
&#13;
Strong Civil Society Movements. The stocktaking exercise suggests that the leaders in the field of&#13;
social accountability in Asia are India and the Philippines. In India, Bangalore is known for the&#13;
citizens' report cards produced by the Public Affairs Centre which have now been replicated&#13;
worldwide. Another example is the National Centre for Advocacy Studies, which has joined&#13;
forces with other budget groups to form the People's Budgetary Information and Analysis&#13;
Service, a network of Indian civil society groups working on budget issues. Yet another example&#13;
is the Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS), which from its humble beginnings as a&#13;
consumer protection group in 1983 has evolved into an international umbrella movement&#13;
integrating diverse areas of public interest.&#13;
&#13;
The Philippines provides other examples of NGO proliferation. Many civic groups sprouted up&#13;
across the country after the 1986 People Power Revolution. An association of election watchdogs&#13;
made up the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections and volunteers in Abra province set&#13;
up an NGO, the Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Government (CCAGG), in response to the&#13;
perceived need to monitor public expenditures. The national network of the National Movement&#13;
for Free Elections has also been instrumental in the Textbook Count Project by mobilizing&#13;
volunteers from its chapters nationwide. The Textbook Count Project began an effort to curb&#13;
corruption in textbook procurement that resulted in a shortage of textbooks in many schools. To&#13;
this end, civil society groups are helping the Department of Education monitor the delivery of the&#13;
correct numbers of textbooks to district and high schools. Social Weather Stations (SWS), a&#13;
leading survey research institute in the Philippines, is well respected for its survey work with the&#13;
poor. It collects their opinions on corrupt practices, aggregates the data, and publishes reports for&#13;
the media. As a result of actions by SWS, pressure was put on the government, which has&#13;
recently been working to respond to the high incidence of hunger found by SWS.&#13;
&#13;
For its part, Procurement Watch, Inc., a Philippine NGO, has stressed that procurement-related&#13;
corruption leaves a paper trail and that procurement activities can therefore be documented and&#13;
reviewed. It established a credible standard, summarized as checklists, for bidding for goods,&#13;
supplies, services, and infrastructure projects. It maintains active monitoring partnerships with the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
departments of Budget and Management, Health, Labor, and Public Works and works with them&#13;
on procurement reform.&#13;
&#13;
Access to Information. Civic groups and governments have come to realize the value of&#13;
information in relation to their advocacy activities. Right to information acts are in place in Japan&#13;
and in some Indian states, for example, Goa and Hyderabad, and often pertain to data on&#13;
expenditures on public projects. Various Indian states used citizens' charters to upgrade their&#13;
public services. A citizens' charter is the expression of an understanding between citizens and a&#13;
public service provider about the quantity and quality of services citizens receive in exchange for&#13;
their taxes. It is a written, voluntary declaration by a service provider about its service standards,&#13;
accessibility, transparency, and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
In Japan, citizens came together to push for, and succeeded in establishing, the Right to&#13;
Information Act; in the Philippines, Social Weather Station fought with members of Congress and&#13;
the judiciary for the right to publish survey information, and the Philippine Center for&#13;
Investigative Journalism specialized in digging up and publishing information on corruption; and&#13;
in Bangladesh, Transparency International-Bangladesh compiled information about corruption&#13;
cases and brought them to the public's attention.&#13;
&#13;
In another example, the passage of the Delhi Right to Information Act of 2001 allowed citizens&#13;
access to government files, but in practice, they were generally not informed about these rights&#13;
under the law. To aid in promoting transparency and accountability, Parivartan, an organization&#13;
helping citizens to gain access to government services without resorting to bribery and extortion,&#13;
educated the public on how to use the Information Act. In Goa, India, the Right to Information&#13;
Act guarantees the right of any citizen to apply in writing for any information relating to the&#13;
affairs of the state or of any local authorities. Citizens can photocopy entire files pertaining to&#13;
government transactions. The law also provides a procedure for appeals against requests that have&#13;
been denied.&#13;
&#13;
The "Sendai ombudsman" in Japan was established to ascertain the extent to which local public&#13;
officials had misappropriated funds for entertainment and hospitality purposes. They initiated a&#13;
formal request to the government for participation in a nationwide information disclosure on&#13;
April 25, 1995. On that day, attorneys nationwide filed requests for food and beverage reports for&#13;
fiscal year 1993 with the respective sections of each prefectural government. Ordinances&#13;
generally grant the authorities two weeks to respond. The directors of the National Liaison&#13;
Council (which consists of national civic ombudsmen and was established because of the&#13;
widespread corruption uncovered throughout the country's 47 prefectures) requested that all&#13;
ombudsmen provide the materials they had collected so as to create a national database and report&#13;
in time for the council's July meeting in Nagoya. The ombudsmen selected a narrow target for&#13;
their second coordinated national request of local government files: on January 25, 1996, they&#13;
filed requests to see the travel spending records of prefectural auditing staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Mechanisms and Applications&#13;
&#13;
This section discusses the array of social accountability mechanisms found during the&#13;
stocktaking. Most fall into the budget analysis, expenditure tracking, and performance monitoring&#13;
categories, but new activities such as lifestyle checks, social audits, and activities involving&#13;
information and communications technology (ICT) have emerged. Some evidence of evolution is&#13;
also apparent in that the mechanisms have been adapted to fit local contexts.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
Budget Analysis&#13;
&#13;
NGOs scrutinized budgets to ascertain the extent to which fiscal allocations truly reflected&#13;
government commitments as revealed by their prioritization in the budget. Assessments looked&#13;
into the impact of the budget on social priorities, particularly on pro-poor programs. The civic&#13;
groups translated the raw numbers and technical analysis into lay language, making their reports&#13;
available to the public via the mass media. They also conducted seminars to raise popular&#13;
awareness of the budget process and budget issues. Budget analysis interventions varied&#13;
according to the issue being studied: spending priorities, total availability of resources, trends&#13;
over time, and so on. They also varied according to the intended audience: communities, sectors,&#13;
local governments, and the nation as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
National Budget Analysis. In Nepal, a communist insurgency gained strength in rural areas&#13;
beginning in 1986. Since 1990, 11 governments have ruled the country and the cabinet has been&#13;
reshuffled 30 times. Polarization has characterized Nepalese politics, and until late 2002, when&#13;
King Gyanendra had the prime minister suspend parliament because of unrest, the main&#13;
opposition party was the Communist Party. The king consolidated his power thereafter and has&#13;
since promulgated the budget without oversight. Despite these constraints, Action Aid Nepal&#13;
undertook a national budget analysis in July 2003, to assess social expenditures and to promote&#13;
government reforms in relation to its policies and practices that affect poverty. It estimated that&#13;
some assigned development expenditures would be diverted for military expenditures because of&#13;
the security situation.&#13;
&#13;
The Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability performed a national budget analysis for&#13;
India for the 2003Â­2004 budget. The NGO concluded that the process was not satisfactory in the&#13;
following areas: (a) civil society participation, (b) transparency in relation to the implications of&#13;
budget proposals on different sectors, and (c) budget implementation.&#13;
&#13;
State Budget Analysis. Budget groups in India often analyzed public spending at the state level.&#13;
The Tamil Nadu People's Forum for Social Development looked at the state's budget priorities&#13;
during 1998Â­99. It concluded that the state government's economic policy based on privatization&#13;
and global integration biased the budget against social development. Also in India, CUTS&#13;
scrutinized the budget of the state of Rajasthan and informed the public about how the funds&#13;
allocated for them remained unused at different government levels. At the government's request,&#13;
the People's Budgetary Information and Analysis Service analyzed the budget for the Indian state&#13;
of Maharashtra for 2000. The organization's report recommended doing away with budget&#13;
secrecy, circulating vital documents before the presentation of the budget, and publishing&#13;
information about subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
Local Budget Analysis. In 2001, Action Aid Nepal sponsored an NGO to conduct community-&#13;
level budget analysis in some villages in the Kailali district. Analysis of local budgets was done&#13;
with a grassroots NGO called Backward Society Education (BASE) working in the plains of far&#13;
western Nepal. BASE's main area of work had been empowerment of the Tharu community, who&#13;
had been bonded laborers for centuries. The analysis began in 2000Â­2001. Action Aid Nepal's&#13;
engagement at the micro level is continuous and draws heavily upon participatory techniques and&#13;
approaches. AAN regularly organizes trainings on participatory approaches and methods; these&#13;
interfaces aim to empower community members to assess their situation and to adopt solutions to&#13;
their local problems. Community baseline data are gathered through local grassroots&#13;
organizations. AAN also conducts regular social audits and participatory planning and budgeting&#13;
exercises with its NGO partner affiliates in 22 districts across the country. Though not formal&#13;

               Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"budget analysis" as such, these attempts have helped to enhance public awareness and analytical&#13;
competencies.&#13;
&#13;
Sectoral Budget Analysis. The NGO, Developing Initiatives for Social and Human Action, began&#13;
its budget advocacy by scrutinizing funding for the tribal population in Gujarat, India. The Centre&#13;
for Budget and Policy Studies in Bangalore studied education expenditure at the district level in&#13;
Karnataka state with the cooperation of Karnataka's Department of Education. The project served&#13;
as a model for how civil society groups could work with the government without compromising&#13;
their independence. In Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Governance Studies analyzed the&#13;
impact of housing policy and budgets on the poor living in slums and the Coalition for Women&#13;
pursued budget advocacy in relation to women's concerns. In the Marshall Islands, a joint&#13;
government-civil society initiative was the project Gender- and Youth-Sensitive Public&#13;
Expenditure Management. It looked into the low-paying jobs of women workers, violence against&#13;
women, high dropout rates among schoolgirls, and pregnancies and high birthrates among&#13;
teenagers.&#13;
&#13;
Budget Demystification. Large numbers, complex codification and accounting systems and a&#13;
long list of headings make understanding the budget difficult. In recent years, many groups have&#13;
begun to develop skills to promote improved budget literacy and debate among citizens in such a&#13;
way that it inspires them to question the manner in which policies are made and budget&#13;
formulated. Budget simplification and demystification includes information on the structure and&#13;
cycle of the budget, the timing and sequencing of the budget process and institutional roles and&#13;
responsibilities of various actors. The Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability in India&#13;
holds workshops at the national and regional levels to demystify the budget. In Maharashtra,&#13;
India, Samarthan published a booklet explaining the budget in a simple and reader-friendly&#13;
format. The Bandung Institute of Governance Studies in Indonesia has been simplifying&#13;
Bandung's municipal budget to make it more understandable to the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Participatory Budget Expenditure Tracking&#13;
&#13;
Civic groups monitor how the government actually spends public funds with a focus on leakages&#13;
as resources flow downstream, as leakages are an indication of both system inefficiencies and&#13;
corruption. Typically, these groups employ the actual users or beneficiaries of government&#13;
services (assisted by Civil Society Organizations) to collect and publicly disseminate data on&#13;
inputs and expenditures. A common technique is to compare official documents, such as&#13;
disbursement and agency records, with actual delivery data. For example, if a contract specifies&#13;
the delivery of 450 textbooks for a public school but the school only receives 378, the&#13;
discrepancies are revealed to the concerned offices and to the public. In addition to social audits,&#13;
the stocktaking found a wide range of other interventions for budget expenditure tracking, for&#13;
instance, civil society groups have fought for the right to access public finance records. They also&#13;
scrutinize the public procurement process and uncover corruption via in-depth media reports and&#13;
by examining the lifestyles of public officials to determine whether they are living beyond their&#13;
apparent means.&#13;
&#13;
Social Audits. Social audits involve the community in scrutinizing public projects and the&#13;
amounts actually spent on them. They are also a tool that government departments can use to&#13;
plan, manage, and measure nonfinancial activities and to monitor both the internal and external&#13;
consequences of their social and commercial operations. In New Delhi, the NGO Parivartan&#13;
conducted a social audit to expose irregularities in public expenditures. Parivartan obtained&#13;
documents on government works and read the details of contracts during public hearings so that&#13;
community members could compare official allocations with the reality on the ground. Parivartan&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reviewed 68 public works in northeastern New Delhi via hearings and found that many roads&#13;
existed only on paper.&#13;
&#13;
A leading exponent of the social audit mechanism is the Organization for the Power of Laborers&#13;
and Farmers (Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan) of Rajasthan, India. In Rajasthan, government&#13;
officials regularly denied poor, illiterate workers their statutory minimum wages. The actual&#13;
quantity of work being done was routinely undermeasured. False entries in employment registers&#13;
enabled project foremen to underpay laborers and pad registers with bogus names whose&#13;
payments would be pocketed by supervisors. Other malpractices included inflated estimates for&#13;
public works projects, use of poor-quality materials, and overbilling by suppliers. Because the&#13;
records in question were kept classified, it appeared that making government records accessible to&#13;
public scrutiny would solve the problem of contradictory claims. By mid-1994, the Organization&#13;
for the Power of Laborers and Farmers was leading the struggle for minimum wages and sought&#13;
access to official expenditure documents that could be investigated and verified. It demanded&#13;
copies of official records of expenditures incurred in the name of panchayats.2 The secured&#13;
documents were scrutinized and subject to collective verification at people's hearings, a process&#13;
of participatory social auditing.&#13;
&#13;
The NGO Public Record of Operations and Finance in Bangalore persuaded the city government&#13;
to release quarterly public statements on its financial performance that compare revenues and&#13;
expenditures with original budget estimates. In the Philippines, the NGO CCAGG monitors&#13;
construction projects and provides financial details about such projects on its radio program. The&#13;
NGO has also forged ties with the Commission on Audit to conduct an ongoing audit on a local&#13;
government. In Pakistan, the civic group Community Information and Epidemiological&#13;
Technologies International and the National Reconstruction Bureau, a government agency, have&#13;
conducted a social audit in the health, education, and water sectors, as well as local government&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
Sectoral Expenditure Tracking. The Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability in New&#13;
Delhi looks at allocations and expenditures on the social sector e.g. health, education, food&#13;
security, drinking water, tribal development, etc. This tracking helps in understanding the&#13;
government priorities being given to these sectors and hence creating strategies of advocacy and&#13;
lobbying with the government.&#13;
&#13;
Community Expenditure Tracking. KALAHI-CIDSS, a community driven development (CDD)&#13;
program is the flagship antipoverty program of the national government in the Philippines and is&#13;
supported by the World Bank. Villages choose infrastructure projects to address their basic needs.&#13;
They prepare formal budgets and proposals and the best proposal in the municipality wins the&#13;
funding. Spending is closely monitored, as all financial statements are posted on the village&#13;
bulletin board and reported to the assembly.&#13;
&#13;
Lifestyle Checks. Philippine law requires all public officials to file statements of their assets and&#13;
liabilities every year. If the assets are much higher than what can be accounted for by their&#13;
salaries, savings, marriage, or inheritance, they are investigated. Indicators include unexplained&#13;
bank deposits, manifestly excessive expenditures, ostentatious displays of wealth, frequent travel&#13;
abroad, and the like. Three key government agencies--the Office of the Ombudsman, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2The panchayat is the village-level local self-government institution in India, whose jurisdiction is over a&#13;
few villages. Local self-government institutions in India have a three-tier structure: the gram panchayat at&#13;
the village level, the panchayat samiti or taluka panchayat at the block level, and the zilla parishad at the&#13;
district level.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region     13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Presidential Antigraft Commission, and the Transparency Group of the Office of the Presidential&#13;
Chief of Staff--are currently conducting lifestyle checks on government officials of agencies&#13;
prone to corruption. Investigators of these key government agencies conduct lifestyle checks on&#13;
officials by verifying their statements of assets and liabilities followed up with visits to their&#13;
offices and homes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Participatory Performance Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
NGOs or their client communities use the performance monitoring to observe the implementation&#13;
and performance of local projects, public services, or government programs. This entails citizen&#13;
groups or communities monitoring and evaluating the implementation and performance of public&#13;
services or projects, according to indicators the service users and providers themselves have&#13;
selected. Performance monitoring also involves elements of public advocacy. The common theme&#13;
is evaluating the impact. Data obtained as a result of evaluations are presented to the concerned&#13;
authorities at workshops and are also shared with the public via the mass media, unleashing&#13;
pressure for reform. Performance monitoring requires setting standards and operationalizing them&#13;
into indicators against which the people themselves measure actual performance in relation to&#13;
welfare impact.&#13;
&#13;
Project Monitors. Government Watch is a Filipino initiative to monitor projects by public&#13;
agencies. Volunteers deployed to project sites assess any deviations between planned and actual&#13;
results. An initiative by the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections responded to&#13;
corruption in textbook delivery and the resulting shortages in schools in the Philippines. The&#13;
group mobilized civil society organizations to monitor the terms of delivery and inspected the&#13;
printing, binding, and packaging of textbooks in the warehouses. The group then monitored&#13;
deliveries, examined the condition of delivered goods, and verified the accuracy of book counts.&#13;
The variance between planned and actual results emerged along quantity dimensions, for&#13;
example, 56,000 textbooks were ordered for schools but only 45,000 were delivered.&#13;
&#13;
Citizen Report Cards. Initiated by the Public Affairs Centre in Bangalore and now replicated&#13;
worldwide, citizen report cards are surveys of public and social services that affect the poor and&#13;
give service recipients an opportunity to grade the agencies that provide the services. The unit of&#13;
analysis is the household or individual, and the method relies on stratified sampling to ensure that&#13;
the data from a survey questionnaire are representative of the underlying population. The intent is&#13;
to uncover problem areas in relation to service delivery. The dimensions probed include access,&#13;
quality, affordability, willingness to pay, staff behavior, efficiency, reliability, adequacy of&#13;
supplies, and overall user satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
The Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project in India uses report cards to&#13;
ascertain users' perceptions and satisfaction levels about the services delivered by the project and&#13;
to assess the performance of the water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
The Solomon Islands Development Trust, whose mission is to improve life in villages, conducted&#13;
six citizens' report cards from 1989 to 2003 covering the following areas: health, education, land&#13;
use, and forest and marine resources. The objective was to obtain feedback from citizens to&#13;
improve the quality of services in these areas. The country became engulfed in political turmoil&#13;
following the 1997Â­98 Asian financial crisis, precipitating an economic breakdown. Social&#13;
services and the police force virtually collapsed amid fighting between rival armed gangs. In mid-&#13;
2003, the social strife and conflict evolved into an insurgency. The Australian government&#13;
deployed an intervention force known as Regional Assistance of the Solomon Islands to restore&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
order on behalf of the government of the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands Development&#13;
Trust conducted a citizen report card for the period 2001Â­2003 that showed the worst results in 15&#13;
years, because of the civil unrest.&#13;
&#13;
Actionaid Bangladesh had developed a wide range of participatory advocacy activities in&#13;
partnership with local NGOs, such as participatory video as a tool for pressurizing local&#13;
administration to deliver better performing schools and citizen's report cards as the basis for local&#13;
campaigns on the quality of education.&#13;
&#13;
The report card methodology has been successfully adapted to conduct an urban poverty profile&#13;
survey. In 2002, the Sevenatha Urban Resource Center, a local NGO in the field of participatory&#13;
urban development in Sri Lanka, worked in collaboration with the Colombo Municipal Council to&#13;
carry out a citywide report card to assess the poverty situation in low-income settlements in&#13;
Colombo and the delivery of municipal services to these communities. Sevenatha used a report&#13;
card developed by the Urban Governance Initiative, a regional project supported by the United&#13;
Nations Development Programme. Sevenatha had field tested the report card in the Colombo and&#13;
Kandy municipalities in 2000 to assess levels of community satisfaction with housing and shelter&#13;
programs. The poverty profile survey defined poverty levels by using 20 variables and 80&#13;
indicators. The resulting document, "Poverty Profile--City of Colombia," produced in early&#13;
2002, highlights the poverty situation of low-income settlements and the problems and positive&#13;
experiences of consumers of services provided by the municipality. It also provided a database&#13;
for the municipality and influenced staff of the Colombo Municipal Council to work in&#13;
partnership with civil society organizations (Jayaratne 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Community Score Cards. The community scorecard process permits tracking inputs or&#13;
expenditures, monitoring the quality of services and projects, generating benchmark performance&#13;
criteria that can be used in resource allocation and budget decisions, comparing performance&#13;
across facilities and districts, and generating a direct feedback mechanism between providers and&#13;
users. The community score card process is a community-based monitoring tool that uses the&#13;
community as its unit of analysis and focuses on monitoring at the local or facility level. It&#13;
employs a methodology for soliciting users' perceptions about quality, efficiency, and&#13;
transparency similar to that used by citizen report cards.&#13;
&#13;
In Sri Lanka, the Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project is designed to&#13;
target poor communities in the project area and improve their livelihoods and quality of life by&#13;
enabling them to build accountable institutions and to manage sustainable investments. The&#13;
project uses community score cards to list the criteria for evaluating the performance of village&#13;
organizations, and communities grade their performance every month for six months. In addition,&#13;
the village organizations evaluate themselves and present their findings to the villages.&#13;
&#13;
In Bangladesh, the Local Governance Development Fund Project uses annual scorecards to assess&#13;
the performance of the government entities known as union parishads (UP), the lowest level of&#13;
rural local government bodies, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. It grades their officials,&#13;
financial management, service delivery, female participation in decision making, transparency,&#13;
accountability and overall governance. The assessments are done once a year with the&#13;
participation of community and UP representatives and other local government officials. Around&#13;
100Â­300 people attend the assessment sessions which are facilitated by UP representatives. The&#13;
scores then are displayed on public boards. Based on the assessments, the UP developed capacity&#13;
building plans to improve performance.&#13;

                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region      15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      Other Types of Social Accountability and&#13;
                              Citizen Feedback Mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned earlier, the Asia and Pacific region stocktaking exercise found social accountability&#13;
mechanisms that do not fall only within the four phases of the participatory public management&#13;
expenditure cycle. These include citizen feedback mechanisms where citizens as "consumers" are&#13;
best positioned to provide feedback on the design, implementation and improvement of programs&#13;
and projects. Some citizen feedback mechanisms include: public hearings, public forums, citizen&#13;
advisory boards, study circles, government contract committees, and direct feedback either in&#13;
person, by mail, electronically or by phone. One example of an effective citizen feedback&#13;
mechanism is "Bhagidari" by the government of Delhi, India. This initiative resulted from a need&#13;
to identify or develop a model that helps the citizens and government officials meet, sit together,&#13;
interact, overcome their inhibitions, and develop a real dialogue, to act together and solve&#13;
problems together. It was used as a means for facilitating changes in Delhi: to utilize processes&#13;
and principles of multi-stakeholder (citizen groups, NGOs, the government) collaboration, to aim&#13;
to develop joint ownership by the citizens and government of the change process; and to facilitate&#13;
people's participation in governance (Vinay 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Citizens' Charters. Indian civic groups like Praja and Lok Satta guide residents in writing&#13;
citizens' charters for their municipalities that spell out the responsibilities of local governments.&#13;
After much discussion and revision, the people present the charters to local officials and pressure&#13;
them to approve the charters. Once a charter has been ratified, the civic groups hold regular&#13;
meetings with the municipal corporations and the citizens commit themselves to monitoring how&#13;
the public services comply with the charter's standards.&#13;
&#13;
Integrity Pacts. This initiative by Transparency International Nepal comes from the Bhaktapur&#13;
region. An integrity pact is a contract or agreement by the local government to adopt a package of&#13;
measures put forward by Transparency International Nepal. Public officials and employees&#13;
pledge to implement the so-called integrity system, that is, not to take bribes, to make decision&#13;
making simple and transparent, to have realistic construction budgets, and to be open to and&#13;
responsive to complaints by citizens. Procurement procedures and guidelines are delineated and a&#13;
system for redressing grievances is set up along with a monitoring committee that includes a&#13;
representative of Transparency International Nepal. Activities included the following:&#13;
&#13;
    Â·    concept orientation by Transparency International by means of meetings and visits to&#13;
         municipalities and district development committees;&#13;
    Â·    pledge signatory assurances from, for example, mayors or chairs of municipalities and&#13;
         district development committees that the integrity pact would be implemented;&#13;
    Â·    organization of open pledge signing ceremonies in Transparency International Nepal's&#13;
         presence;&#13;
    Â·    formation of monitoring committees with a Transparency International Nepal&#13;
         representative;&#13;
    Â·    pre- and post-impact evaluation surveys of local residents in terms of the transparency,&#13;
         integrity, and accountability of the respective organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Citizen Jury or People's Verdict. Residents are chosen by an oversight panel of NGOs and/or&#13;
donor organizations to study an issue that will greatly affect their community. They are given&#13;
information on the topic by means of talks, videos, and readings; have discussions with subject&#13;
matter specialists; and deliberate all facets of the issue. Eventually they render their verdict on the&#13;
issue to the community, the authorities, and the media.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In June 2001 in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, a citizen jury made of twenty marginal-&#13;
livelihood farmers, small traders, small food processors, and consumers deliberated over the&#13;
future of the state's food system in light of the official plan, Vision 2020, looking at its&#13;
implications for livelihood security, biodiversity, and the foundations of the local economy. Some&#13;
of the jurors had never left their local villages before. Although many could not read or write,&#13;
they were determined to learn and to make their voices heard about the future of agriculture in&#13;
their state. For some time the British government, the World Bank and some North American&#13;
consultants had been working with state officials to develop a twenty-year strategy to mechanize,&#13;
consolidate and genetically engineer Andhra Pradesh's agriculture to produce cash crops for&#13;
export, and to reduce the farming population from seventy percent to forty percent, freeing&#13;
workers up for industry. However those who were to benefit from these developments were not&#13;
consulted on whether they liked this new direction or not. The citizens' jury was designed to&#13;
correct that omission.&#13;
&#13;
The jurors were given three scenarios to consider which were presented by videos illustrating key&#13;
features, followed by a summary of the policies and institutions that steered Andhra Pradesh in&#13;
that direction. Jurors then heard testimony from, and cross-examined, expert witnesses, including&#13;
key government officials, scientists, corporate and civil society representatives from all levels of&#13;
state, national and international. The panel was chaired by a former Chief Justice of India's&#13;
Supreme Court. On July 1st, the citizen jurors presented their recommendations and provided&#13;
many suggestions for practical steps that could be taken to help realize their vision.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring Procurement. In May 2003, Procurement Watch, Inc. (PWI), a Philippine nonprofit,&#13;
nonpartisan civil society organization established in 2001 to instill good governance by&#13;
combating graft and corruption in public procurement through advocacy, research, training and&#13;
partnerships, received $8,200 (approximately PHP 434,570.20) for the development of a public&#13;
bidding checklist and the monitoring of two procurement activities each of three Local&#13;
Government Units (LGUs) in Metro Manila following the Implementing Rules and Regulations&#13;
of the Government Procurement Reform Act. The GPRA laid the legal foundation for&#13;
overhauling the whole government procurement process. The GPRA applies to three procurement&#13;
types: infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services, and covers both the National&#13;
Government Agencies and the Local Government Units. The GPRA also standardized the&#13;
procurement procedures that must be adopted by all agencies of government and required the&#13;
issuance of the procurement manuals and standard bidding documents, all expected to contribute&#13;
to the smooth flow of the procurement process (Tolentino 2005). Procurement Watch, Inc. trains&#13;
civil society organizations on the intricacies of procurement. It deploys observers armed with&#13;
checklists to official bidding sessions. When they discover anomalies, the civil society&#13;
organizations bring them to the attention of agency management. Those who continue to rig bids&#13;
are reported to civil society watchdogs.&#13;
&#13;
Information and Communications Technology&#13;
&#13;
Information and communication technology (ICT) is the technology required for information&#13;
processing and in particular for computers and computer software which convert, store, protect&#13;
process, transmit, and retrieve information. ICT is an increasingly powerful tool for participating&#13;
in global markets, promoting accountability, improving the delivery of basic services, and&#13;
enhancing local development opportunities. It fosters new and deeper citizen involvement within&#13;
the governing process.&#13;
&#13;
The growth and development of information and communication technologies has led to their&#13;
wide diffusion and application. It is being used, for example, to promote social accountability by&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
opening official data to public scrutiny. In a speech at the Ninth Anti-Corruption Conference in&#13;
Durban, South Africa, in June 1999, the mayor of Seoul noted that "sunshine is the best&#13;
disinfectant." The outcome is disclosure of and access to information and entry into the public&#13;
domain of state budgets and actual expenditures, procurement and official purchases, and&#13;
infrastructure projects and the sums allocated for them along with the names of those behind&#13;
government transactions.&#13;
&#13;
Transactions with agencies are done via Internet portals, thereby removing the element of staff&#13;
discretion, which is widely regarded as an opportunity for bribery. Cell phone networks are also&#13;
considered to belong to the class of ICT tools. Because of the popularity of text messaging in&#13;
Asia, mobile phones are useful for gathering reports about acts of petty corruption and can be&#13;
instrumental in name-and-shame campaigns.&#13;
&#13;
Internet portals can be divided into the following three main groups as they relate to social&#13;
accountability:&#13;
&#13;
    Â·   Preventive. Civil society groups have been pushing for sites that avert acts of corruption&#13;
        by depersonalizing transactions and removing the element of discretion. Putting fiscal&#13;
        information in the public domain via the Internet has begun to block opportunities for&#13;
        corrupt deals.&#13;
    Â·   Informative. These sites help civil society groups by uploading data from government&#13;
        files, such as budgets, expenditure tallies, and details of public projects. In the past NGOs&#13;
        would request documents in hard copy, whereas today they merely need to access the&#13;
        pertinent sites. NGOs analyze the data, derive key conclusions, and demystify the&#13;
        findings for the public. In 1999, the mayor of Seoul proposed a system for preventing&#13;
        corruption and addressing citizens' right to information that would ensure transparency&#13;
        by disclosing administrative procedures and providing real-time information on the status&#13;
        of transactions on the Internet.&#13;
    Â·   Punitive. These government and NGO sites penalize the corrupt by publicizing their&#13;
        names, including those of both individuals and firms.&#13;
&#13;
Online Transactions. The metropolitan government of Seoul recently developed an online system&#13;
to review permit applications and decisions on such applications in an effort to rid the city of its&#13;
longstanding reputation as a hotbed of corruption. This Web-based system, Online Procedures&#13;
Enhancement for Civil Applications or OPEN, enables citizens to monitor in real-time details of&#13;
the handling of their applications, to know the names of the officials assigned to their applications&#13;
and their contact information, to be aware of the procedures involved in application approval and&#13;
review, and to find out when they can expect permits to be awarded. This kind of application,&#13;
which suppresses the impulse to engage in fraud, is being touted as Seoul's next most important&#13;
export.&#13;
&#13;
In India, each e-seva computerized kiosk can handle more than 100 services, ranging from getting&#13;
birth certificates to paying examination fees to buying tickets to cultural events. The e-seva&#13;
system is also employed for dealing with many utilities, such as electricity, transport, water&#13;
supply, and railways, and with hospitals and municipal corporations. By digitalizing transactions,&#13;
the government eliminates layers of middlemen, which reduces tendencies toward corruption.&#13;
&#13;
Information technology for effective citizen feedback was used in the "Online Grievance&#13;
Redressal Tracking System" being implemented in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The&#13;
objectives are to facilitate the lodging and monitoring of grievances online; to provide&#13;
information on municipal services; to enforce the time frame of service delivery defined in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
citizens charter on municipal services; to improve the quality of public services; to improve&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of municipalities and ensure transparency and accountability in the&#13;
grievance redress mechanism; and to enable citizen feedback (Vinay 2005).&#13;
&#13;
E-procurement. Through e-procurement, government agencies can compare prices offered by&#13;
various sellers, resulting in the contracts most advantageous for the agencies. This was a Korean&#13;
innovation by the Public Procurement Service that has since been replicated across Asia. The&#13;
objective of the e-procurement system is to make public procurement more transparent,&#13;
competitive, and efficient by delivering the service through the Internet. It provides integrated&#13;
information on bids, prequalifies suppliers to participate in all public bids, and standardizes&#13;
product information. In Korea, more than 25,000 public organizations are required by law to list&#13;
their bidding information on this Web site, which prequalifies suppliers and standardizes product&#13;
information. The public can use the system to compare prices offered by different suppliers.&#13;
Private bidders cannot collude with each other because all the bids are disclosed online. For the&#13;
same reason, government procurement officers cannot delay the placing of orders.&#13;
&#13;
Blacklists. In the Philippines, the Department of Budget and Management posts the names of&#13;
blacklisted contractors on its Web site, which shows which companies have had their licenses&#13;
suspended, revoked, or denied.&#13;
&#13;
Pork Barrel Spending. Another Web site by Congress Watch, part of the Filipino civil society&#13;
alliance Transparent and Accountable Governance, monitors pork barrel spending by legislators&#13;
and reprints in-depth articles on the subject on the site.&#13;
&#13;
Public Works Projects. The Web site of Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department contains&#13;
information on infrastructure projects: road and bridge data, names of personnel involved, and&#13;
financial project information, plus contractor, tender, and document databases. It also includes&#13;
audit reports. Every month the site updates financial and physical information on all the&#13;
department's infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
Text Messaging Database. A recent innovation, this mechanism takes advantage of the&#13;
popularity of text messaging in the Philippines. The intervention is aimed at containing acts of&#13;
petty corruption by civil servants. Using their cell phones, people can report graft as it occurs but&#13;
remain anonymous. For example, when a clerk at city hall asks for a bribe, the citizen sends a text&#13;
message to the hotline of the Office of the Ombudsman. If the names of the same offenders keep&#13;
appearing on the database, the office investigates the claims.&#13;
&#13;
News Databases. Transparency International-Bangladesh scans news articles about corruption&#13;
cases and aggregates them into a comprehensive report. For instance, in 2000 it collected 846&#13;
news reports with figures on government losses resulting from corruption. The database is made&#13;
available on a Web site and is a valuable tool for investigative work on expenditure tracking, for&#13;
follow-up research, for updates on ongoing corruption cases, and for keeping government&#13;
officials on their toes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             Inclusion&#13;
&#13;
Civic groups running social accountability mechanisms want their interventions to be as inclusive&#13;
as possible, especially in relation to the poor. However, the complexity of the information&#13;
involved and the lack of education of the poor sometimes limit their involvement. This constraint&#13;
is reflected in a comment made during an interview by Vinod Vyasulu of the Centre for Budget&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region     19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and Policy Studies during the course of research for this report: "The poor are not involved. We&#13;
have tried to include slum dwellers associations, but this has not been successful . . . We are&#13;
trying to build their capacity in this regard."&#13;
&#13;
Our review finds that inclusion can vary as follows: (a) the extent to which the general public is&#13;
involved, (b) the extent to which the public can become involved via the Internet, (c) the extent to&#13;
which the poor or excluded groups become involved after they have been organized and trained,&#13;
and (d) the extent to which few people are involved because they require specialized knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Extent of Involvement by the General Public&#13;
&#13;
Surveys involve the general public because each adult resident has an equal chance of being&#13;
included in the representative sample. As long as the selection process is random, a sample of&#13;
respondents can speak for the whole nation. Social accountability mechanisms open to the general&#13;
public often take the form of citizens' report cards. Our stocktaking has gathered report card&#13;
findings from Ahmedabad and Hyderabad in India, Bharatpur in Nepal, nine cities of the national&#13;
capital region in the Philippines, Colombo and Kandy in Sri Lanka, and the Solomon Islands.&#13;
&#13;
A right to information act is, in theory, open to all citizens. In Goa, India, however, the law does&#13;
not promote a culture of automatic information disclosure. Rather, it leads to the grudging release&#13;
of information in response to individual petitions. Since the passage of the act, only a few civil&#13;
society groups, such as the All-Goa Citizens' Committee for Social Justice and Action, have&#13;
extensively exercised their information rights.&#13;
&#13;
Direct feedback mechanisms may be considered open to the public as well. Transparency&#13;
International Malaysia runs a toll-free corruption hotline. The mayor of Seoul receives postage-&#13;
free postcards complaining about corruption. A new feedback instrument in the Philippines is the&#13;
text message database of the Office of the Ombudsman. Cell phones are extremely popular in the&#13;
Philippines, even among the poor, and sending text messages is much cheaper than making a call&#13;
even on a landline phone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Inclusion via the Internet&#13;
&#13;
Internet interventions are open to the public, because they can be accessed by anyone with an&#13;
Internet connection. General services are provided by India's e-seva and Korea's OPEN facility.&#13;
Groups that want to monitor public spending can check various e-procurement sites in Asia, such&#13;
as the pork barrel site in the Philippines and the highway department site in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
However, digital divide issues can limit inclusion. For example, in Bangladesh, little has been&#13;
done to popularize the downloading of public information from the Internet. This is due to&#13;
formidable obstacles: most Web sites are in English, few citizens of Bangladesh can read English,&#13;
and computer use is not popular, as most people view personal computers as tools of the elite that&#13;
are irrelevant to their daily lives. In addition, computers are lacking in many government offices,&#13;
and in those that have them are sometimes seen as little more than glorified typewriters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Social Mobilization and Capacity Development to Empower the Poor&#13;
&#13;
Examples of mechanisms that empower the poor are numerous, for example, Parivartan taught&#13;
poor residents of Sundernagari and New Seemapuri how to hold public hearings and the CCAGG&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mobilized the people of Abra province in the Philippines to monitor their own infrastructure&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
In Indonesia, members of the Coalition for Women received basic training on the budget. The&#13;
Marshall Islands Gender Budget Project mobilized women's groups through the NGO umbrella&#13;
alliance Women United in the Marshall Islands. CUTS in India worked with grassroots social&#13;
action groups through training workshops. The latter in turn relayed information to communities&#13;
through traditional village meetings.&#13;
&#13;
The KALAHI-CIDSS Project in the Philippines covers 42 of the poorest provinces in the country.&#13;
The project is inclusive, as it is designed to involve the poorest communities through&#13;
participative, demand-driven infrastructure projects. The target for community participation is for&#13;
80 percent of all village households to attend village assemblies. In some villages, participation&#13;
has reached 98 percent. This exercise is creating a cadre of leaders who will total some 50,000 by&#13;
the time the project ends and who will be equipped with the skills to prepare project proposals&#13;
and to demand projects from their local politicians.&#13;
&#13;
Another training-intensive case is the Sirajganj Local Government Development Fund in&#13;
Bangladesh, which emphasizes participation by the poor in decision making. They participate in&#13;
committees, meetings, and planning sessions and implement, operate, monitor, and maintain the&#13;
projects. The venture promotes learning-by-doing.&#13;
&#13;
The citizen's jury in Andhra Pradesh has organized a good deal of training for marginalized&#13;
classes and castes. According to Oversight Panel member Paul Ter Weil: "What was most&#13;
interesting was the fact that farmers, on the basis of their knowledge, wisdom and feelings, rather&#13;
quickly understood what they are dealing with . . . What amazed me indeed was that they&#13;
immediately knew whether what was being told to them was nonsense or propaganda or whether&#13;
it had some meaning" (Wakeford and Pimbert 2004, p. 27).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Lack of Inclusiveness of Specialized Interventions&#13;
&#13;
Specialized interventions cannot be considered inclusive because of their technical skill&#13;
requirements. For example, a citizen ombudsman in Japan is a lawyer with special training who&#13;
can examine complex expense accounts, the members of Procurement Watch have mastered the&#13;
labyrinth of the procurement process, and the Public Accounts Committee in Nepal consists of&#13;
legislators who comb through the government's financial statements. Agents deployed to conduct&#13;
lifestyle checks know how to read between the lines of asset statements, the top-tier analysts of&#13;
budget groups specialize in fiscal scrutiny, and investigative journalists have almost always&#13;
finished graduate school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             Advocacy&#13;
&#13;
Advocacy is a participatory process designed by citizens and citizens' groups to effect change and&#13;
is an important component of any social accountability initiative. It consists of a series of&#13;
activities undertaken with the aim of changing policies and values and practices and behavior, as&#13;
well as building skills and organizations. The advocacy strategies used in the Asia and Pacific&#13;
region are varied and include communication strategies, data dissemination, awareness-raising&#13;
campaigns, and public forums to discuss social accountability findings, articles in the press,&#13;
media events, posters, newsletters, and exhibits. One common pattern seen in the Asia and the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region      21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pacific region stocktaking is that initiatives that used advocacy were more successful than those&#13;
which did not include it. The lesson is to get information about the initiative and its findings out&#13;
to the public.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Newsletters and Handbooks&#13;
&#13;
Movements must first inform their members through their own publications. The newsletter of&#13;
CUTS, India, is called The Fifth Estate and highlights governance issues and projects by CUTS.&#13;
Its target audience is civil society. It is bilingual in English and Hindi and an electronic version is&#13;
produced that is distributed internationally. Another is Letter for You, a monthly newsletter that&#13;
informs readers about NGO activities, government accountability issues, and the consumer&#13;
movement. Village Revolution is a monthly wall newspaper for rural areas that focuses on&#13;
peoples' rights and programs that affect residents.&#13;
&#13;
Groups also produce political handbooks and primers. The Centre for Budget and Governance&#13;
Accountability in New Delhi tries to simplify the budget by developing reference guides and&#13;
training manuals. Samarthan in Bangalore, India, does the same by publishing a reader-friendly&#13;
booklet. Indonesia's Coalition for Women produces training modules on political education and&#13;
leadership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Press Releases&#13;
&#13;
Groups share the findings of social accountability initiatives with the public at large via the mass&#13;
media. For example, broadsheets and broadcasters are always instrumental in disseminating the&#13;
survey results of SWS in the Philippines, and its press releases often make the newspapers' front&#13;
pages and the evening news telecasts.&#13;
&#13;
However, not all groups' press releases on fiscal research are deemed newsworthy. When asked&#13;
for this report if its findings are covered well in the media, the response from the Centre for&#13;
Budget and Policy Studies was: "Not well at all. Occasionally someone asks a specific question,&#13;
but budget analysis per se does not seem to interest them. They would like newsworthy stuff--&#13;
corruption, I'm afraid."&#13;
&#13;
That stands in contrast with the avid response to releases by TIB. Most newspapers write lead&#13;
stories on their findings and private television channels cover the events. The BBC Bengali&#13;
service regularly broadcasts news on issues researched by TIB. The same interest is seen in&#13;
citizen juries in Andhra Pradesh, India. The children's road survey also caught the media's&#13;
attention: children putting pressure on senior local government officials caused great excitement&#13;
in Bangalore. The general lesson seems to be that putting names and faces behind the numbers&#13;
can make reports interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Radio and Television Programs&#13;
&#13;
The Public Record of Operations and Finance hosts "Puttana on Air," a weekly radio program in&#13;
the Kannada language. Discussions cover many of the concerns of the citizens of Bangalore, such&#13;
as local government finances, ward problems, environment, health, and sanitation. Another&#13;
example comes from the CCAGG, which has a Sunday primetime radio program "Echoes." Once&#13;
the organization receives a list of projects implemented in Abra, it goes on the air to disseminate&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
their details, such as their costs, the agency running the projects, and the manner of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Lok Satta produces two- to three-minute videos known as public broadcasting capsules that detail&#13;
its concerns regarding each public service. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism has&#13;
produced five full-length documentaries that have been broadcast on television.&#13;
&#13;
Dissemination of Findings&#13;
&#13;
A critical part of advocacy is to bring findings to the attention of the relevant officials and to&#13;
negotiate for change. In India, the results of the children's road survey have been presented to the&#13;
Bangalore municipal commissioner at a public function. Praja conducts citizen-municipality&#13;
workshops to get the support of employees who deliver public services. In India, the NGO CUTS&#13;
meets with members of the Rajasthan Assembly, ministers, and secretaries of various&#13;
departments.&#13;
&#13;
In Korea, the results of the gender budget analysis were delivered to the government and&#13;
presented at a forum organized by the Korea Women's Development Institute. The Ministry of&#13;
Gender Equality, heads of local governments, members of local assemblies, and female members&#13;
of the national legislature all received copies of the results. In Indonesia, the Coalition for&#13;
Women submitted its blueprint for a national action plan to the Ministry of Women's&#13;
Empowerment; drafted proposals; lobbied for amendments to the 1945 constitution; and wrote&#13;
position papers on maternity rights, affirmative action for women, and antitrafficking measures.&#13;
&#13;
At times groups take to the streets to add to the pressure on government. For example, Samarthan&#13;
of Maharashtra, India, pressed for an increase in the budget for education. It led 5,000 people in&#13;
protesting outside the state house. They carried a huge begging bowl and asked passers by to&#13;
contribute to the state's coffers for education. This embarrassed the chief minister, who appointed&#13;
a task force to study the problem.&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines, the findings of Social Weather Stations survey on corruption are used to design&#13;
the programs of the Transparent and Accountable Governance civil society coalition and of&#13;
official anticorruption bodies. The agencies revealed as the most corrupt are coming under&#13;
increasing fire, for example, Congress is considering a bill to purge the Bureau of Internal&#13;
Revenue and replace it with a newly established national revenue authority.&#13;
&#13;
In response to its survey data on youth indifference to corruption, Cambodia's Center for Social&#13;
Development campaigned to introduce anticorruption education into the school curriculum. A&#13;
transparency task force formed in 1999 developed the necessary instructional materials and&#13;
integrated them into the national training program for teachers. In 2002, the Ministry of&#13;
Education began revising textbooks to integrate the materials produced by the task force.&#13;
&#13;
The data generated by the Self-Employed Women's Association's report card in Ahmedabad,&#13;
India, were employed at many levels. The association used the data for its own organizational&#13;
work, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation applied them to its international proposals, and the&#13;
Foundation for Public Interest used them to expand its own work in the urban sector.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Intervention Outcomes&#13;
&#13;
Most of the social accountability initiatives reviewed for the Asia and Pacific region stocktaking&#13;
exercise were initiated in response to particular situations, therefore the outcomes varied&#13;
depending on the political context and culture, the role of the media, the extent of access to&#13;
information, the advocacy and communication strategies employed, the capacity of civil society&#13;
and the state, the synergy between the state and civil society synergies, and the level of&#13;
institutionalization.&#13;
&#13;
Social Problems Exposed&#13;
&#13;
The state government of Maharashtra, India, once denied the existence of bonded labor. A recent&#13;
performance budget claimed that the state had had no bonded laborers since 1992, but Samarthan&#13;
presented another document that showed that it had rehabilitated more than 300 bonded laborers&#13;
in one district alone. The press reported the inconsistency, forcing the minister to present the true&#13;
picture.&#13;
&#13;
A year after the Goa Right to Information Act was passed, individuals seeking the release of&#13;
information filed 400 applications. The information sought ranged from details about possibly&#13;
illegal construction activities to the amounts of business taxes paid by those known to be favored&#13;
by the government. However, the petitions filed to date cannot yet be viewed as a serious&#13;
campaign against corruption affecting the poor.&#13;
&#13;
In 2000, TIB analyzed 11 reports per day for its news scan database and found that agencies&#13;
responsible for implementing laws were the most corrupt, accounting for 320 out of the total of&#13;
1,948 reports of corruption. However, official action taken in these cases was not satisfactory, as&#13;
the official anticorruption bureau dealt with only 5 percent of the cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Public Opinion Inflamed&#13;
&#13;
Watchdog journalism groups and the media in general play a vital role in raising social awareness&#13;
by turning raw accounting statements into investigative reports that make headline news. Linking&#13;
the names of politicians to funds derived from dishonest means provokes public outrage.&#13;
&#13;
The information released by Parivartan's social audits angered local residents. They demanded a&#13;
platform to air their grievances, even amid threats and risks to their safety. The momentum for&#13;
action was overwhelming: even efforts by the government to disrupt the social audits were&#13;
overrun by the people.&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesian Forum on Budget Transparency's reports on politicians' fund use stirred up&#13;
public anger. The network found that the governor of Jakarta and his councilors were getting&#13;
allowances worth a total of Rp 44 billion a year, with the money being taken from funds intended&#13;
for education, social affairs, and youth. The Indonesian Forum on Budget Transparency's reports&#13;
forced the governor of Jakarta to cut his allowances by 40 percent. The Jakarta Post (January 31,&#13;
2003, p. 8) used strong language in its commentary: "It would appear that the governor, the&#13;
deputy-governor and councilors are in the happy position of being able to enjoy their good&#13;
fortune without any obligation to account to the public...The Indonesian Forum for Budget&#13;
Transparency . . . which revealed the extra allocations for the governor and the councilors, said&#13;
the money was part of a conspiracy among the city's political elite to hoodwink the public."&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A 2000 corruption case involved the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation. The Public Accounts&#13;
Committee probed the case and reported grave corruption and irregularities implicating the&#13;
minister for tourism and civil aviation. Opposition parties disrupted parliamentary sessions for 57&#13;
days, and yet no action was taken. The opposition mobilized its followers for a general strike that&#13;
lasted for three violent days. The constitutional body responsible for investigating corruption&#13;
concurred with the committee's findings, and the minister was arrested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Corruption Prosecuted&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines alone, three cases have gone to trial. Government audit teams investigated the&#13;
Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance's earliest complaints and filed administrative&#13;
cases against 11 public works engineers. Politicians tried to step in and intervene on their behalf,&#13;
but other community service organizations supported the cause while the cases were in court.&#13;
Eventually, the accused were found guilty.&#13;
&#13;
The lifestyle checks netted a number of high-ranking officials, including a general, an&#13;
undersecretary of the Public Works Department, and an assistant secretary of the Public Works&#13;
Department. Several officials of the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue were&#13;
also fired and charged in court. Some 600 cases of corruption were filed against presidential&#13;
appointees.&#13;
&#13;
In July to October 2000, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism released three reports&#13;
on President Joseph Estrada's unexplained wealth and the mansions he was building for his&#13;
mistresses. The reports on the president's mansions became part of the impeachment suit filed&#13;
against him later in the year. He was overthrown in the second People Power Revolution of&#13;
January 2001.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the OPEN initiative, procurement in Korea has become much more competitive&#13;
than in the past. Currently 87,000 suppliers are registered on the site and around 1.2 million&#13;
people participate in e-bidding every month. The various agencies can check on each other in&#13;
relation to the awarding of bids. According to a Gallup Korea poll, 84 percent of Seoul&#13;
inhabitants believe that OPEN is effectively slashing graft.&#13;
&#13;
The Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance's monitoring activities have decreased the&#13;
systemic corruption in Abra province in the Philippines. Their radio program that exposes the&#13;
corruption is one of its most effective tools. According to representative of the CCAGG&#13;
interviewed for this report, government officials have become quite cautious as regards their&#13;
actions in case they become "CCAGGed" (a new slang term for having one's misdeeds exposed&#13;
on the air). Its assessment reports are now used as one of the bases for releasing government&#13;
funds for infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
Policies and Laws Changed&#13;
&#13;
The NGO Procurement Watch, Inc. helped secure the passage of the Government Procurement&#13;
Reform Act through the parliamentary process by providing policy analysis, technical assistance,&#13;
advocacy support, as well as the conduct of information campaigns for both the private and public&#13;
sectors. It was also a major player in the formulation of the Implementing Rules and Regulations,&#13;
led by an Inter-Agency Technical Working Group, led by the Department of Budget and&#13;
Management, the government agency leading procurement reforms in the country. The law&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region   25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
covers the procurement process for the national government, local governments, and state-owned&#13;
and controlled corporations.&#13;
&#13;
Women's Link, a Korean NGO, carried out a budget analysis in 2001 with the aim of expanding&#13;
the government's budget and human resources devoted to women's concerns. It gathered data and&#13;
statistics to evaluate the goals of the government's polices on women's issues and to analyze&#13;
local government allocations of tax revenues and expenditures in support of the government's&#13;
policies in relation to women. It also conducted detailed interviews with women on their&#13;
perceptions of government policies toward women. The budget analysis found that the budget&#13;
allocations directed toward women's policies were extremely low, the statistics were not&#13;
disaggregated by gender, and the women's policy department of the government had little&#13;
authority. In addition, women were underrepresented in the government bureaucracy. In 2001, the&#13;
Korea Women's Development Network organized a forum and presented these and other findings&#13;
to government officials. As a result, some government councilors subsequently incorporated&#13;
Women's Links' recommendations in the 2002 national budget.&#13;
&#13;
As the result of its social audit and public hearings, Parivartan made recommendations to the&#13;
Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation Department that would reduce the scope of&#13;
corruption. The following recommendations have been accepted: (a) a board displaying basic&#13;
information about a work, such as the title of the work, the name of contractor, the sanctioned&#13;
amount, the starting and completion dates, and the scope of work, will be displayed at every work&#13;
site; (b) the Municipal Corporation Department in the pertinent area will have copies of contracts&#13;
pertaining to all ongoing works in that area pasted on its walls; (d) the departments of the Delhi&#13;
government will start conducting public hearings on their own; and (e) the works carried out by&#13;
any department will be displayed prominently on a wall in the relevant area.&#13;
&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness Improved&#13;
&#13;
Korea's e-procurement has resulted in efficiency gains, with the savings amounting to an&#13;
estimated $2.5 billion per year in procurement costs. This compares with the investment of $26&#13;
million to set up the system.&#13;
&#13;
Because of reforms in its procurement process in 2001, the Department of Education in the&#13;
Philippines reports that its prices for textbooks have fallen by as much as 65 percent, allowing for&#13;
the purchase of an additional 11 million to 16 million textbooks.&#13;
&#13;
Because Lok Satta in India has organized citizens to monitor fuel outlets, short-selling has&#13;
effectively stopped in all 1,500 gasoline stations in Andhra Pradesh. In many cities, employees at&#13;
property registration offices have been forced to refund the bribes they collected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           Public Service Efficiency Enhanced&#13;
&#13;
In 1998, Lok Satta released a citizens' charter covering more than 40 public services. The charter&#13;
and the People's Watch movement subsequently forced the state government of Andhra Pradesh&#13;
to commit to citizens' charters in eight of its departments in 2001, namely:&#13;
&#13;
    Â·    the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board,&#13;
    Â·    the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation,&#13;
    Â·    the Transport Department,&#13;
    Â·    the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Works and Sewerage Board,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Â·    the employment exchanges,&#13;
    Â·    the Commercial Taxes Department,&#13;
    Â·    the Registration Department,&#13;
    Â·    the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad.&#13;
&#13;
Thanks to the systematic advocacy and media campaigns spearheaded by Lok Satta in recent&#13;
years, these citizens' charters drew the attention of ordinary citizens. An excellent citizens'&#13;
charter has been released recently with respect to four services and applicable to all municipalities&#13;
in the state. For the first time in India, compensation of Rs 50 is now payable to residents for&#13;
every day's delay in these services, for example, not issuing a registration in time.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement in Korea formerly involved a large staff, enormous amounts of paper, and many&#13;
trips to government agencies. Firms seeking government business scanned newspaper&#13;
advertisements and registered with the various agencies. Today e-procurement has slashed much&#13;
red tape. For instance, before e-procurement, payment for goods took 14 days, but today the&#13;
payment is made in just 4 hours.&#13;
&#13;
The impact of Seoul's OPEN system is supported by research presented in December 2001 by a&#13;
team from Korea University. The team found that that 74 percent of applicants thought that&#13;
processing time had been reduced, 86 percent said that applications had become easier, and 62&#13;
percent cited improved accuracy of applications. In addition, the incidence of corruption in&#13;
relation to city contracts dropped from 36 percent before 1999 to 6 percent in 2000. The success&#13;
of the project has attracted the attention of the United Nations, which is working with Seoul to&#13;
export the OPEN system to other countries (George 2001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Problems and Challenges&#13;
&#13;
While many successful outcomes have been attributed to the social accountability interventions in&#13;
the Asia and Pacific region stocktaking exercise, their implementation also faced many problems&#13;
and challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Politicians Have Ignored Findings&#13;
&#13;
Mobilization efforts fail to meet their goals if decision makers do not act upon calls for reform. In&#13;
Indonesia, legislators would be invited to the public discussions organized by the Indonesian&#13;
Forum on Budget Transparency, but they rarely came, and parliament was not responsive to the&#13;
proposed budget changes. In the Philippines, Social Weather Station, an NGO, was respected for&#13;
its academic objectivity and its citizens surveys on corruption, but politicians and agencies that&#13;
got low ratings habitually attacked or dismissed its findings.&#13;
&#13;
Given the charged political atmosphere in Nepal, the administration regarded reports by the&#13;
Public Accounts Committee as political attacks. At times it ignored the reports, while followers of&#13;
the opposition replied by taking to the streets. National Peoples' Front lawmaker Pari Thapa said&#13;
"We already have enough commission reports gathering dust...If only the government would&#13;
dare to implement them." United People's Front lawmaker Lilamani Pokharel added, "Nothing is&#13;
going to happen unless the government looks back at the past reports and implements them."&#13;
&#13;
In Bangalore, three report cards were prepared through the Public Affairs Committee in 1994,&#13;
1999, and 2003. The first report card gave low ratings to all the major service providers in the&#13;
city, creating a sense of shame in the process. However, it did not have an immediate impact, as&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region      27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
only a few of the providers acknowledged their problems and took corrective action. The second&#13;
report card showed that partial improvement had occurred in some services, probably because to&#13;
the actions taken by providers and the pressure from civil society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   Governments Have Conceded Token Changes&#13;
&#13;
Governments may yield to the letter of reform laws but not to their spirit. In some provinces of&#13;
the Philippines, NGOs felt that participation in Local Development Councils began and ended&#13;
with the accreditation of NGOs. On the part of the local governments, they tended to limit NGOs'&#13;
participation to merely inviting them to meetings without seriously considering their proposals.&#13;
The civil society alliance Caucus of Development NGOs, the Philippines' largest network of&#13;
NGOs, conducted a study of 300 local governments and found that only a quarter of them&#13;
designated NGO council representatives. Research by the civic group the Philippine Partnership&#13;
for Development of Human Resources in Rural Areas noted that NGOs perceived their&#13;
participation in Local Development Councils to be mere tokenism.&#13;
&#13;
In India, the Goa Right to Information Act guarantees that any citizen can apply in writing for any&#13;
information relating to the affairs of the state or any local authorities. Once they have received an&#13;
application, agencies have 30 days to furnish or refuse to provide the information. One agency,&#13;
the Economic Development Corporation, has issued a string of objections to requests on the&#13;
grounds that petitioners did not qualify as citizens under the act, that the information requested&#13;
was not clearly in the public interest, that the Goa Right to Information Act did not permit fishing&#13;
or roving inquiries of a general nature relating to the affairs of bodies within its purview, and that&#13;
the information sought related to commercial secrets protected by law. One provision specified&#13;
fines for people who used information obtained as a result of the bill for "mala fide purposes."&#13;
Activities and journalists believed that this clause was really meant to intimidate the press.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Bureaucracies Have Resisted Reforms&#13;
&#13;
Change proved to be threatening to bureaucracies, prompting certain offices to oppose&#13;
accountability mechanisms. When Transparency International-Bangladesh released its reports on&#13;
corruption, the concerned institutions or ministries tended to criticize them and got their allies to&#13;
write negative articles about the corruption watchdog in the newspapers. In India, Parivartan&#13;
complained that little action was taken in relation to certain acts of corruption it had exposed.&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines, the leadership of the Commission on Audit initially did not take well to the&#13;
Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance's participatory audit and resisted the move to&#13;
involve civil society in a function that required accounting expertise. Neither did the community-&#13;
driven development project KALAHI-CIDSS find a ready audience. Critics argued that&#13;
KALAHI-CIDSS was too community based and did not take advantage of economies of scale.&#13;
Hence the nation's economic planning authority initially shot it down, but lobbying by the Social&#13;
Welfare Department reversed the authority's decision.&#13;
&#13;
More interesting was the bureaucracy's resistance to e-procurement in the Philippines. Some&#13;
Procurement Service employees feared job cuts as a result of computerization. The agencies were&#13;
also reluctant to give up control of their procurement authority. They were assured by their&#13;
management that e-procurement was meant primarily to disseminate information and that they&#13;
would still handle the evaluation of bids. Furthermore, the system was pilot tested during the time&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
when President Joseph Estrada was facing impeachment charges and the prospect of his removal&#13;
already threatened the tenure of his budget secretary and head of procurement.&#13;
&#13;
Access to Government Data Has Been Restricted&#13;
&#13;
Governments have been hesitant to share their data, as they recognize that knowledge is power in&#13;
the hands of their citizens. Korean officials were often unwilling to cooperate with civil society&#13;
groups undertaking budget analysis and were unresponsive to public requests for information. As&#13;
a result, Women's Link collected information through unofficial routes such as through friends or&#13;
acquaintances in government departments. Action Aid Nepal faced the same bottleneck in getting&#13;
data on local budgets. In the Philippines, some public officials feared that the results from the&#13;
report card on nine cities in Metro Manila would be used against them, which led to delays in&#13;
data gathering.&#13;
&#13;
In India, even states with right to information laws resisted sharing government data. As Vinod&#13;
Vyasulu of the Centre for Budget and Policy Studies put it in a telephone interview for this&#13;
report: "The main problem has been the lack of proper records in various local government&#13;
offices, and in getting access. The new Right to Information law has not really made a difference&#13;
in this regard. We have to spend lots of time in getting data. We deal with it by visiting officers&#13;
often and with persistence."&#13;
&#13;
Parivartan observed that despite the law, no action was taken against officers who refused to&#13;
provide timely or accurate information. The process of obtaining and inspecting records was not&#13;
well explained and the fees charged to obtain information were quite high. For its part, CUTS&#13;
noted that the process was hampered by delays. The task of collecting all the necessary data also&#13;
ate up a lot of government staff time, plus the constant turnover of government officials caused&#13;
more postponements.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the national disclosure bill implemented by the Sendai ombudsman in Japan, newly&#13;
elected governors in the prefectures of Sendai and Aoshima in Tokyo were given a stark choice:&#13;
should they enforce the new disclosure rules or should they try to protect their staff? One&#13;
governor toed the official line. Virtually alone among Japan's local governments, Tokyo took the&#13;
position that the metropolitan government need not release any information about entertainment&#13;
spending that was under investigation by the Sendai ombudsman. Even the most prominent pro-&#13;
disclosure governor in the country agreed to a critical limitation on his government's response.&#13;
The ombudsman filed suit against both governments. In June 1996, the Tokyo District Court&#13;
ordered the Tokyo prefecture to respond to the ombudsman's request, but this order was&#13;
appealed. The prefecture of Miyagi protested that the release of the names and positions of public&#13;
officials attending functions would violate their right to privacy; that the release of the names of&#13;
restaurants and details of expenditures would unlawfully disclose confidential business&#13;
information; and that the disclosure of the identities of those attending, the location of the events,&#13;
and the details of expenditure would obstruct the proper conduct of administrative duties. Privacy&#13;
has been commonly raised as a defense to inquiries into the financial practices of Japan's elected&#13;
officials. To date, all attempts to establish a national account numbering system tracking financial&#13;
accounts have been blocked.&#13;
&#13;

        Civil Groups Face Capacity, Resource, and Time Constraints&#13;
&#13;
Civil society work in Cambodia is still in its formative stages because democracy is relatively&#13;
new and the country has to make up for its lack of professionals, a legacy of the Khmer Rouge&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region    29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
era. In the Philippines, the NGOs had little funding support to enable them to participate&#13;
effectively in Local Development Councils, and the groups that participated in Local&#13;
Development Councils did not have the skills and technical expertise needed to fulfill their&#13;
mandates. Similarly, the lack of funds has impaired citizens' report card projects in the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
In India, the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability is still in its initial stages and at&#13;
the time of the stocktaking had only five staff. Another entity, CUTS, noted the lack of capacity&#13;
among its grassroots groups. In addition, responsibilities were sometimes not clearly delineated&#13;
between CUTS and selected partner organizations. For the gender project in the Marshall Islands,&#13;
the constraint was the one-year time frame, which was adequate for the first goal of raising&#13;
awareness but too short to have an impact on changing the budget.&#13;
&#13;
In Sri Lanka, no significant policy changes resulted from the Colombo report card on the health&#13;
and education sector. The Center for Policy Alternatives later attributed this to the lack of an&#13;
advocacy and communication strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    ICT Infrastructure Barriers Hinder Progress&#13;
&#13;
ICT social accountability mechanisms cannot be used when nations do not invest enough in&#13;
telecommunications. Bangladesh had a Web site on infrastructure projects, but little had been&#13;
done to popularize getting government information from the Internet, largely because of the&#13;
formidable digital divide obstacles noted earlier. E-procurement was slow to catch on in the&#13;
Philippines as well, with one factor being various agencies' lack of resources to achieve full&#13;
computerization: only a quarter of the agencies that received training on e-procurement were&#13;
ready for it. Another obstacle was low Internet penetration: a 1999 survey revealed that only 8&#13;
percent of Filipinos had Internet access, largely because of the lack of telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Institutionalizing Social Accountability Mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
While ad hoc or one-off social accountability initiatives can make a difference, experience shows&#13;
that impact is the greatest and most sustainable when social accountability mechanisms are&#13;
institutionalized, or in other words, embedded in and systematically implemented by a civil&#13;
society, state, or hybrid institution. Institutionalization is possible through a number of routes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Regular Repetition&#13;
&#13;
Over a span of 15 years, the Solomon Islands Development Trust undertook six report card&#13;
surveys in the Solomon Islands, each of which evaluated the performance of the party in power.&#13;
This indicates a high degree of institutionalization, as the surveys have survived six governments.&#13;
&#13;
In India, in Ahmedabad, the Self-Employed Women's Association and the Foundation for Public&#13;
Interest conduct their report card project on an annual basis; in Andhra Pradesh, Lok Satta's&#13;
citizens' charters are now an integral part of the state's social fabric; and in Bangalore, the&#13;
Children's Movement for Civic Awareness is not only thriving, but is expanding to 60 schools. In&#13;
Pakistan, a pilot by Community Information and Epidemiological Technologies International has&#13;
led to a social audit each year for five years.&#13;

                                 Replication by Other NGOs&#13;
&#13;
Korean NGOs have supported Seoul's OPEN initiative. Since 2000, Transparency International&#13;
Korea has monitored OPEN through surveys to provide a third party view of the system. The&#13;
OPEN system is also gaining recognition from academics worldwide: in March 2001, the 62nd&#13;
Annual Conference of the American Society for Public Administration selected the OPEN system&#13;
as a success story.&#13;
&#13;
Bhaktapur's integrity pact has caught on in Nepal and in the wider Transparency International&#13;
community. Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Korea, Mexico, and Panama have also&#13;
implemented integrity pacts. The following is taken from a status report of Transparency&#13;
International (2002, p. 43): "Apparently, the impact of the Integrity Pact became so well known&#13;
throughout Nepal that many other communities requested information, leading to a set of regional&#13;
workshops in all five Regions of the country, each with more than 100 participants from the&#13;
public and private sectors."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Internalization by Governments&#13;
&#13;
The state government of Karnataka has allowed the Centre for Budget and Policy Studies to play&#13;
an active role in formulating policy and the center's budget analyses have been used as a&#13;
reference for newly elected government officials. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has&#13;
accepted Praja's citizens' charter initiative and has responded positively to it, holding workshops&#13;
on the charter for municipal staff. In Delhi, because of Parivartan's example, government&#13;
agencies are running social audits.&#13;
&#13;
Almost all Philippine government departments have been clients of Social Weather Station. As an&#13;
SWS tradition, the first person to be briefed on survey results is the president of the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia's Coalition for Women drafted a national plan of action on women's empowerment&#13;
that was adopted by the Ministry of Women's Empowerment. At the request of the Coalition for&#13;
Women, Indonesia established the Caucus of Parliamentarian Women at the national level .The&#13;
coalition has installed itself in the policy-making body of the Ministry for Women's&#13;
Empowerment.&#13;

                      Analysis by Social Accountability Actors&#13;
&#13;
The following table classifies social accountability mechanisms according to their main actors&#13;
and reviews what broad activities each actor does best. For example, as the table shows, people's&#13;
organizations gather community data, NGOs independently process and analyze social data, and&#13;
governments put public sector data in the public domain. The interventions require special&#13;
resources in the form of community organizers, trained professionals, and data sources. The final&#13;
column suggests possible implications for the World Bank.&#13;

                        Conclusions: Forging Advocacy Chains&#13;
&#13;
This review concludes by asking what more can be done and what mechanisms are lacking in the&#13;
Asia and Pacific region. The stocktaking does not include participatory budgeting, but initial&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32    Arroyo and Sirker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reviews indicate that this intervention is not yet popular. Even though it is often found in India,&#13;
and has even been institutionalized by the state of Kerala, and some local governments in&#13;
Bangladesh and the Philippines also employ participatory budgeting, the mechanism has not&#13;
gained much ground in the rest of the region.&#13;
&#13;
The review has seen more in the way of uneven development of innovations as opposed to a lack&#13;
of innovation development. For example, India is extremely advanced in budget advocacy,&#13;
expenditure tracking, performance monitoring, and e-governance solutions. The Philippines is&#13;
following in India's wake, but is many steps behind. The best approach for the countries of the&#13;
Asia and Pacific region would be to share information on the entire range of interventions.&#13;
Budget advocacy was pioneered in India and replicated in nations like Bangladesh, Indonesia,&#13;
Nepal, and the Philippines. A subset of this work was the drive for gender budgets, which began&#13;
in South Africa, and was replicated in India, Korea, the Marshall Islands, and the Philippines. The&#13;
citizen juries of Andhra Pradesh, India, are also not homegrown, but have been used in the United&#13;
Kingdom for social research.&#13;
&#13;
At the heart of social accountability work in the Asia and Pacific region is public pressure for&#13;
access to accurate fiscal information. Information is generated and retrieved, sifted and packaged,&#13;
shared internally, and disseminated to the public. All these steps are needed for effective&#13;
engagement with those who craft policy. It is possible for a large civic movement to embark on&#13;
these activities on its own; however, a more effective approach for most NGOs would be to create&#13;
alliances with other entities that could complement their individual efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Synergy multiplies the power of any one organization. This review has found much synergy,&#13;
complementary activity, and convergence among social accountability groups in India and the&#13;
Philippines in particular. Advocacy chains represent gains from pursuing synergy. Different&#13;
groups involved in social accountability mechanisms link together to hold the state accountable&#13;
for its services that target the poor. These advocacy chains should include the following elements:&#13;
&#13;
    Â·    NGOs that conduct fiscal research. Gathering robustand systematic data is imperative.&#13;
         Activist groups find the appropriate research entry point by determining communities'&#13;
         most pressing needs. The civic organizations monitor public spending at the local, state,&#13;
         or national levels. This may require field workers, local public hearings, or a desk review&#13;
         of documents. Findings, critiques, and recommendations are written up into a technical&#13;
         report.&#13;
    Â·    Efforts to build the capacity of people's organizations. Some groups demystify the&#13;
         findings of fiscal advocacy reports into bulletins, summary sheets, and briefing kits.&#13;
         Often in the vernacular, they are used to train the movement's members. Upgrading the&#13;
         community's capabilities so that the residents themselves can generate the data would be&#13;
         ideal. The process is empowering in itself. Individuals and groups that become well&#13;
         versed in particular issues build a constituency.&#13;
    Â·    Ties with the mass media. Activist groups should circulate demystified reports to the&#13;
         general public via the mass media. NGOs issue press releases, alert the newspapers to&#13;
         their Web sites, hold press conferences, or sponsor events that are newsworthy. The most&#13;
         effective agents of persuasion seem to be commentators on television and radio; however,&#13;
         they still rely on information to guide their research. Editorials, features, and&#13;
         investigative reports are thus valuable aids for public analysis. The groups can sustain&#13;
         human interest by putting a human face on numbers.&#13;
    Â·    Internet presence. Making fiscal data and performance reports public by posting them on&#13;
         the Internet is vital. In cyberspace, social accountability is exercised not by a single&#13;
         NGO, but by the public at large. The public monitors budgets, actual expenditures, or&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Stocktaking of Social Accountability Initiatives in the Asia and Pacific Region      33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  agency performance through Web sites. Various Internet mechanisms run by&#13;
  governments have been created partly because of NGO pressure for information&#13;
  disclosure.&#13;
Â· Use of public opinion surveys. Ultimately, members of parliament, governors, and&#13;
  mayors will have to make policy decisions, but as elected officials, they want to&#13;
  maximize their votes during elections. Surveys reveal public opinion on various issues.&#13;
  Politicians who directly oppose policy directions preferred by the public risk not being&#13;
  re-elected.&#13;
Â· Lobbying and social mobilization. It is not enough for civic groups to write their reports,&#13;
  for the media to release the findings to the public, and for survey results to be on the side&#13;
  of the reformers. Civil society movements also need to approach policy makers to present&#13;
  alternatives. Direct, face-to-face negotiations are imperative, and all the other&#13;
  interventions build up to this climax.&#13;

            Stocktaking of social accountability

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            For many years, World Bank knowledge and
            learning pertaining to social accountability stemmed from a
            handful of pioneering initiatives, such as those on
            participatory budgeting by the municipality of Porto Alegre,
            Brazil; on budget analysis by the Institute for Democracy in
            South Africa; and the report card on pro-poor services in
            the Philippines by the Department of Budget and Management.
            Given the need for a broader investigation of social
            accountability approaches and initiatives, a stocktaking
            exercise was launched in the Asia and Pacific region with
            the hope of extending the Bank&#146;s knowledge base.
