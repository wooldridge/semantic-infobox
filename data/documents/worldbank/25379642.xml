increased jobs faster than in other sectors&#13;
and accounts for 12 percent of city tax&#13;

the size and importance of New York, the challenges faced by the city to develop a&#13;
technology-based innovation ecosystem were similar to those facing many other&#13;

with the community and private sector, thereby providing incentives to the latter.&#13;

tech ecosystem do not require a bachelor's degree (HR &amp; A Advisors 2014). Pilot&#13;
initiatives targeting poor and unskilled population from neighborhoods, such as the&#13;
Coalition for Queens, confirm that rapid skills training with mentorship results in&#13;
direct employability. From the first batch of this program, 20 graduates, 70 percent&#13;
obtained full-time employment, 15 percent became entrepreneurs, and the rest&#13;
entered formal education programs (Hsu 2014). Further, almost a quarter of New&#13;
York tech startup founders do not have any technical background, and most of these&#13;
startups focus on non-tech sectors, introducing technology-driven innovation to&#13;
existing industries and businesses (HR &amp; A Advisors 2014).                  actions, and that those policy actions&#13;

New York has been able to develop one of the largest tech-innovation ecosystems&#13;
with limited tech talent, which is a constraint many cities face. New York is not the&#13;
only city applying these policies and support. Other cities-including Amsterdam,  such as New York, are already creating&#13;
Barcelona, Helsinki, and London, to name a few-are also actively supporting the  technology innovation ecosystems with&#13;

Computation Institute, Harris School of Public of Policy, University of Chicago&#13;
The Computation Institute (CI) was established in 2000 as a joint initiative between The University of Chicago and Argonne&#13;
National Laboratory to advance science through innovative computational approaches. Scholarship in the sciences, arts, and&#13;
medicine depends increasingly on collection and analysis of large quantities of data and detailed numerical simulations of complex&#13;
phenomena. Progress is gated by researchers' ability to construct complex software systems, to harness large-scale computing, and&#13;
to federate distributed resources. The CI is both an intellectual nexus and resource center for those building and applying such&#13;
computational platforms for science. As an intellectual nexus, it brings together researchers from different disciplines with common&#13;
interests in advancing the state-of-the-art in computing and its applications. As a resource center, it provides expert assistance to&#13;
scholars whose work requires the most advanced computational methods.'&#13;

Innovation ecosystem-related projects the team has been working with include, but are not limited to:&#13;
LEBANON MOBILE INTERNET ECOSYSTEM PROJECT (MIEP)&#13;
MIEP's objective is to strengthen technology-led innovation ecosystem and foster entrepreneurship and employability in Lebanon.&#13;
The project focus is to grow and sustain the ecosystem community, expand technical and entrepreneurial skills and to expand the&#13;
technology ecosystem throughout the economic sectors in Lebanon.&#13;
The project is a 4-year program with a budget of USD 12.8 MM with four main activities:&#13;
1. Skills training for youth and entrepreneurs. The activity will develop a series of crowdsourcing competitions, which will&#13;
include intense hand-on training (for example, bootcamp style) with a light acceleration phase. The result of this competition&#13;
will be a series of startup projects (that is, minimum viable prototype beta tested, a business plan and a pitch). The&#13;
competitions will also include an international mentorship program and exchange to connect the Lebanese ecosystem to others.&#13;
In addition, this activity will create a university-industry platform for industry project training and a series of technology skills&#13;
activities for schools. The university-industry platform will provide final-year students to team up with industry to solve real&#13;
challenges from companies through a start-up or product projects in a 6-month timeframe.&#13;
2. Growth and sustainability of the tech-innovation community. The activity will develop network of mentors, links&#13;
among entrepreneurs and networking events (for example, meetups) to support existing community. The activity will also&#13;
complement existing collaboration spaces and provide technology tools (for example, maker space), labs (for example, living&#13;
labs), and a space for community networking. This space will be managed by an innovation hub (the Mobile Innovation Hub,&#13;
MiHub), which will serve to coordinate the community and the community-building activities. The MiHub will also take the&#13;
role of promoting the community and its exemplary members.&#13;
3. Innovation for legacy industry and other sector of the economy. The activity will develop a series of hands-on workshops&#13;
and activities between technology startups and entrepreneurs, and legacy industries that have not integrated widely technology&#13;
in their production processes. This activity will also develop exchange activities with experts from other innovation ecosystems&#13;
globally. This project is supported by a Trust Fund of the Korean-World Bank partnership.'&#13;
SMART CITY GRAN CONCEPCION&#13;
Smart City Gran Concepci6n activity objectives are: (i) to introduce open innovation in municipal government, (ii) to use the&#13;
government as a platform to kickstart the local technology innovation ecosystem, and (iii) create the mechanisms to develop a&#13;
sustainable technology innovation ecosystem to solve city challenges and create entrepreneurship and employability.&#13;
The activity focused on the transport sector and follows four consecutive components that result in the above-mentioned goals:&#13;
1. Hands-on skills training on open innovation methodologies to city officials.&#13;

2. Cocreation of a vision for technology support for urban transport with the city ecosystem (for example, government, academia,&#13;
private sector, civil society, technology hubs, citizens).&#13;
3. Challenge competition of city challenges to kickstart the technology innovation ecosystem and develop solutions to city&#13;
problems.&#13;
4. Cocreation of local innovation hub with the stakeholders of the city ecosystem (for example, government, academia, private&#13;
sector, civil society, technology hubs, citizens).&#13;
This activity was funded by the Spanish Trust Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean.6&#13;
COLOMBIA OPEN INNOVATION FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES&#13;
The objectives of this activity are to promote local government transparency, efficiency and e-services delivery to improve public&#13;
service delivery and ultimately the quality of life of the population. To achieve this goal, the activity introduced open innovation in&#13;
three cities in Colombia: Barranquilla, Cali and Manizales.&#13;
The activity worked in the sectors that each city selected and followed a sequential approach comprised of the following&#13;
components:&#13;
1. Cocreation of e-services (for example, mobile apps) with city officials and rapid prototyping.&#13;
2. Cocreation of a roadmap for technology support to city services and eliminating departmental silos.&#13;
3. Challenge competition of city challenges as mechanism of open innovation for municipal governments and development of&#13;
local entrepreneurship.&#13;
4. Development of strategic plan with local ecosystem stakeholders (for example, government, academia, private sector, civil&#13;
society, technology hubs, citizens) to support government's open innovation and development of local entrepreneurship.&#13;
This activity was funded by the Information Communications Technologies (ICT) Korean Trust Fund.&#13;
GLOBAL: BARCELONA URBAN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION HUB&#13;
The objectives of this activity is the co-creation of new knowledge and the dissemination of good practices on urban technology&#13;
and innovation that the city of Barcelona and its partners have developed over the years. The main areas of focus relates to&#13;
bottom-up innovation and how city government can engage with the city ecosystem to develop innovation and entrepreneurship&#13;
that addresses urban challenges. The activity organizes Citisense (an annual event on bottom-up approaches to urban&#13;
innovation) together with Smart City Expo World Congress, and the City as a Laboratory training course (a practical program&#13;
for policy-makers to introduce open innovation in city government) and develops common research on urban innovation and&#13;
entrepreneurship. This activity was funded by the City of Barcelona.&#13;

BACKGROUND&#13;
Cities everywhere face a growing influx of people and subsequent demand for public services. Investing in digitalization and civic&#13;
innovation can reduce service development costs, account for user needs in solutions and eventually lead to a more affordable&#13;
delivery and accountable management of resources. Administrators want to learn from each other but participatory approaches&#13;
applied in digital service design often still reside as a tacit know-how in the heads of few committed practitioners. This initiative&#13;
will bring practitioners together to identify, analyze and codify good practices applied in participatory design of ICT enabled&#13;
services/policies in global cities and to share it with peers where mostly needed.&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
The Community of Practice (CoP) provides a vehicle to network lead practitioners in different cities and a platform to engage&#13;
them to work together on promoting open innovation for cities. The CoP will develop an open repository of good practices and&#13;
host a calendar of thematically related events targeted to share knowledge and lessons learned among cities.&#13;
ACTIVITIES&#13;
The CoP is an informal group for practitioners and based on projects of common interest focused on learning and new business&#13;
development. Activities can be discussions, blogging and presentation of members' knowledge, but also more formal projects that&#13;
link members to joint work. Projects can be proposed by the members and executed within the CoP or outside of its domain&#13;
depending on members' interest. Members can propose new projects executed within the CoP. These should have a leader and&#13;
initial work plan. If there is enough support amongst the members, projects are to be defined and started with the working group&#13;
led by a thematic leader.&#13;
WORKING GROUPS&#13;
The proposed Working Groups (WG) are the following:&#13;
* WG 1: Mapping and diagnosis of urban tech innovation ecosystems&#13;
* WG2: Compilation and impact of policies for open innovation&#13;
* WG3: Compilation and common solving mechanisms of challenges that cities face&#13;
* WG4: Curation and knowledge sharing of cases studies and best practices for open innovation tools in cities&#13;
MEMBERSHIP&#13;
The CoP starts initially with a closed membership to prepare the initial work and deliverables. The secretariat of the CoP is hosted&#13;
by the World Bank who will prepare a draft work plan including a proposal for gradual expansion and intake of new members to&#13;
the CoP. The work plan is to be approved by initial members.&#13;
Initial members include the following:&#13;

ï»¿ANALYSIS OF&#13;
GEOGRAPHIC AN&#13;
SOCIAL DIMENSIONSil&#13;
OF ECOSYSTEM&#13;
Kathy Qian and Nga Phuong Nguyen are the main authors of this Appendix.&#13;
In order to measure the value of networking assets in urban innovation ecosystems, the impact of connections on ecosystem&#13;
success outcomes must first be understood. Once the value of incremental connections can be quantified, individual networking&#13;
assets can be ranked and valued by multiplying their success in creating new connections by the value of incremental connections.&#13;
Connections are defined as either social or geographic. While there are multiple metrics that can be used to define success, in this&#13;
analysis the raising of a round of funding is considered as a successful outcome for startups and by extension the ecosystem as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
As such, this analysis focuses on examining the interplay between the geographic, social, and funding dynamics within New York&#13;
City's (NYC) urban innovation ecosystem. The research questions explored and findings were as follows:&#13;
1. Where is the geographic center of NYC's urban innovation ecosystem? The geographic center of NYC's urban innovation&#13;
ecosystem is located in Midtown Manhattan.&#13;
2. Which people or organizations are located at the social center of NYC's urban innovation ecosystem? While startups&#13;
have the highest closeness centrality and are at the center of the social network, incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector,&#13;
and "betweenness" centralities and are key connectors within the ecosystem.&#13;
3. How do the geographic and social connectivity of startups influence their funding outcomes? Social momentum matters.&#13;
The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors, the more likely they are to successfully fundraise. A significant&#13;
impact of geographic centrality on funding outcomes was not found.&#13;
4. What is the relationship between geographic and social centrality? While startups in the geographic center of the startup&#13;
scene may be highly connected, their connections are not as socially diverse.&#13;
In summary, a relationship was found between social connections and funding outcomes within the NYC innovation ecosystem.&#13;
Evidence was also found to support the hypothesis that networking assets are central to the urban innovation ecosystem.&#13;
DATA&#13;
The dataset is comprised of two dimensions: social and geographic. The social dataset includes connections between startups,&#13;
investors, and incubators"5 and was obtained from the raw data Endeavor Insight developed for its study The Power of&#13;
Entrepreneur Networks (Endeavor Insight, 2014).16 The geographic data was obtained by gathering address data through&#13;
Mechanical Turk and geocoding through an online geocoder."&#13;
The urban innovation ecosystem is represented as a network of nodes and edges. Nodes are entities such as people and&#13;
organizations, while edges connect nodes through their relationships. For example, a startup is a node. An investor is also a node.&#13;
An investment is an edge that connects the startup and the investor.&#13;
It can be difficult to determine which nodes fall within the scope of each city's urban innovation ecosystem if one is focused solely&#13;
on geography. What happens if a startup moves from one city to another? Or if a startup takes investment from a firm outside the&#13;
36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM&#13;
city? Fortunately, the primary interest of this research is in mapping the social dimensions of the urban innovation ecosystem, so&#13;
the dataset is more flexible in incorporating nodes outside of NYC.&#13;
In order to define the scope of the data, the startups interviewed by Endeavor from 2013-2014 were first added as nodes. Next,&#13;
the founders of these startups were added as additional nodes, and then their associated investors and incubators were added to&#13;
the list of nodes. Finally, funded companies from which they sourced mentors, previously funded non-NYC startups, and former&#13;
employers that have received funding were included as other nodes. The aim was to map the first and second-order network each&#13;
startup can draw upon in order to reach investors.&#13;
BOX F.1&#13;
The differences between accelerators and incubators&#13;
Although the dataset and analysis does not differentiate between incubators and accelerators, there is a difference in their&#13;
definitions:&#13;
Accelerators support entrepreneurs and start-ups in early stages of development and they are often comprised of the following&#13;
features: (i) a highly competitive and open application process for entrepreneurs, (ii) provision of small amounts of seed investment,&#13;
(iii) focus on small teams rather than individual founders, (iv) intensive support for a limited period of time (usually 3-6 months),&#13;
with active mentorship and networking, and (v) collaborative work among startups through cohort or classes of start-ups.&#13;
Incubators are spaces that support start-ups by providing an office space and administrative support services. The most typical&#13;
services are legal, recruiting, IT, accounting, public relations and pooled buying programs. In addition, incubators may also provide&#13;
coaching, mentorship and help with access to funding at an ad hoc basis. Startups pay rent (which is usually below market rent) for&#13;
the office space and there is normally not a time limit set for startups staying in the incubator (average staying ranges widely from&#13;
18 months to 5 years). Some incubator providers may ask for a profit share in the future or require minority stake in the startup as&#13;
prerequisite to access the incubator.&#13;
Nodes are never removed from the dataset, even if the represented entity no longer exists. In other words, once a startup appeared&#13;
in the dataset, they were kept in the dataset for all subsequent years. There were two reasons for this decision. First, accurate&#13;
end dates for startups were difficult to gather. Second, the primary interest was in mapping the social dimensions of the startup&#13;
network, not creating a year-by-year catalogue of startups. Although startups may close, socially they still function as nodes within&#13;
the urban innovation ecosystem that can introduce other nodes to second-order connections.&#13;
As seen in Figure F.1, in 2014, the latest year of data within our dataset, there were 2,119 startups in the ecosystem. Although&#13;
our dataset is smaller than the Digital.NYC and CrunchBase datasets (the largest publicly available databases of startups in&#13;
NYC), which include about 6700 and 7500 startups respectively, the survey-based sourcing of our dataset is more helpful in&#13;
obtaining historical connection data. However it is important to note that, when it comes to historical data, our dataset also shows&#13;
survivorship bias. As such, our dataset is most accurately described as a year-by-year mapping of how founders of startups that&#13;
existed in 2013-2014 evolved within the ecosystem.&#13;

However, the fact that the dataset was sourced through surveys also introduces biases that we should be aware of. When&#13;
interpreting the results within this paper, it is important to remember that our dataset comprises startups that have already "burst"&#13;
onto the NYC startup scene. As such, these startups are more likely to have already existed for some time and are more likely to&#13;
have already received funding.&#13;
This effect may be seen in Figure F.2, where the number of new startups in our dataset drops after 2012. Given the consistent&#13;
growth in the number of new startups in every year leading up to 2012, it is unlikely that there was a sharp decline in the number&#13;
of new startups. Rather, it is more likely that there was a systematic bias in how interview targets were gathered that caused newer&#13;
startups to be underrepresented.&#13;

In addition to startups, our dataset also includes venture capital firms and incubators. The number of active NYC institutional&#13;
investors is defined as institutional investors with locations in NYC who have made an investment within our dataset in that year&#13;
or prior. Institutional investors include venture capital firms, banks, and investment arms of large corporations. The number of&#13;
active NYC institutional investors jumped in 2000, grew steadily from 2000-2006, then grew more quickly from 2006 onward&#13;
(Figure F.3). In addition to the NYC institutional investors, our dataset also includes institutional investors who have invested in&#13;
at least one NYC startup but are located outside of NYC (Figure F.4).&#13;

The number of active NYC incubators is similarly defined as incubators with locations in NYC who have made an investment&#13;
within our dataset in that year or prior. The number of active NYC incubators grew steadily from 1995-2009, then grew more&#13;

Our dataset also includes the number of active individual investors each year. Individual investors are commonly known as "angel&#13;
investors" Unlike institutional investors and incubators, location data for individual investors was not available, so we do not&#13;
differentiate between individual investors located in NYC and those who do not. The number of individual investors in our dataset&#13;
also rises rapidly beginning in 2009 (Figure F.7).&#13;

In addition to startups and investors, our dataset also includes a few other organizations (Figure F.8). These are the funded&#13;
companies from which startups have sourced mentors," previously funded non-NYC startups of founders, and former employers&#13;
of founders that have received funding. These nodes exist to allow second-order connections to investors within the dataset to be&#13;
measured.&#13;

Our dataset comprises both individuals and organizations (Figure F.10). Technically, the network is bipartite. However, given that&#13;
individual investors can function similarly to institutional investors and founders of small startups are practically synonymous with&#13;
their companies, the network is treated as if it only contains one type of entity.&#13;

These edges include all founding events, 19 funding events, exits, mentorship, and employment relationships (Figure F. 12). It is&#13;
important to remember that edges represent distinct events-if an investor invests in a startup twice, there would be two edges&#13;
between the startup and the investor.&#13;
The vast majority of employment relationships observed in our dataset are the prior employment relationships of current startup&#13;
founders. As such, the number of "current employment" edges is nonexistent in the most recent years.&#13;

By looking at 2014 data, a quick summary of the types of connections seen in the dataset were generated (Table F.1).20 On&#13;
average, each founder founded 1.12 companies, each startup received 5.90 investments, each incubator incubated 7.25 startups,&#13;
each institutional investor made 2.76 investments, and each individual investor made 1.65 investments.&#13;

TOOLS&#13;
A variety of tools were used for the analysis.&#13;
Data was munged and cleaned using SQL and stored in a MySQL database. The graph data was then transformed into a Neo4j&#13;
database. Neo4j allows us to store and search a directed graph database that captures the labels and properties of nodes and edges.&#13;
It also allows for easy querying and visualization of subsets of the graph.&#13;
Data was exported from the Neo4j database and imported into Gephi in order to quickly calculate network statistics such as&#13;
centrality and degree. These values were then imported into Stata to be summarized and regressed.&#13;
Maps were created using Tableau. Charts were created in conjunction with pivot tables in Excel.&#13;
RESULTS&#13;
Our results are fourfold. First, the geographic dimension of the NYC urban innovation ecosystem was mapped and then the social&#13;
dimension was mapped. Then, the interplay between the geographic dynamic, the social dynamic, and the funding dynamic within&#13;
the ecosystem was examined. Finally, the interplay between the geography and social dynamic was explored.&#13;
Geographic Network&#13;
Research question #1: Where is the geographic center of NYC's urban innovation ecosystem?&#13;
It was possible to map the current locations of 70 percent of the NYC startups within our dataset (Figure F.13).&#13;

Most startups and investors were located in Manhattan (Figure F.14). However, startups were more likely than investors to&#13;
be located in the lower Eastern part of the island, as well as in Brooklyn. The majority of startups are clustered in the top 10&#13;
neighborhoods (Table F.2).21&#13;

Research question #2: Which people or organizations are located at the social center of NYC's urban innovation&#13;

An analysis of network statistics indicates that the network is becoming more interconnected over time. Nodes have more direct&#13;
edges over time (Figure F. 15), and the average diameter and average path length decrease steadily post dot-com bust (Figure&#13;
F.16, Figure F.17 ).22 This may mean that players within the urban innovation ecosystem are more likely to know each other over&#13;

In addition to network statistics, for each node the following statistics were also generated.&#13;
The diagrams in Figure F.18 below, while not specific to our dataset, help illustrate the definition and interpretation of each type&#13;
FIGURE F.18&#13;
Centrality types&#13;
Degree centrality measures the number of other nodes within the ecosystem each node is directly&#13;
connected to. It does not take into account any second-order connections.&#13;
Closeness centrality measures a node's social distance to other nodes. It is expressed as the&#13;
inverse of the average distance from each node to every other node in the network. A low closeness&#13;
centrality indicates that the firm is on the edge of the network.&#13;
Eigenvector centrality augments degree centrality by taking into account the connectivity of the&#13;
nodes a node is connected to. Highly connected nodes within highly interconnected clusters have&#13;
high eigenvector centrality.&#13;
Betweenness centrality measures how many times a node acts as a gateway in the network. The&#13;
higher the betweenness centrality of a firm, the more paths run through that firm to connect two&#13;
other firms. High betweenness centrality means that a node is a key bridge or facilitator between&#13;
different clusters.&#13;

of centrality.23 Red indicates higher centrality values. Blue indicates lower centrality values.&#13;
Startups have the highest closeness centrality, while incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities&#13;
(Table F.3). These results support the hypothesis that incubators are key connection spaces within the urban innovation&#13;
ecosystem.&#13;

Research finding #2: While startups have the highest closeness centrality and are at the center of the social&#13;
network, incubators have the highest degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities and are key connectors&#13;
within the ecosystem.&#13;
Impact of Connectivity on Funding Outcomes&#13;
Research Question #3: How do the geographic and social connectivity of startups influence their funding&#13;
outcomes?&#13;
In order to measure the impact of social and geographic connections on startup outcomes, measures of both types of connectivity&#13;
in year n were regressed against the likelihood of obtaining funding in year n+1.&#13;
A binary outcome was used, of either obtaining funding in year n+ I or not, rather than a continuous outcome, such as the size of&#13;
the round obtained. This was because the latter is more likely to be influenced by the particular business opportunity rather than&#13;
the ability to connect to investors.&#13;
We hypothesize that there are unobserved omitted variables that vary by startup and as such a fixed effect model should be used,&#13;
as opposed to a mixed effects model that assumes that unexplained fluctuations within the dataset are random and not inherently&#13;
related to characteristics of each startup. In essence, this acknowledges that there are variables outside of our dataset, for example,&#13;
the presentation skills of the founders, which influence funding outcomes. The hypothesis was tested using a standard econometric&#13;

test called the Hausman Test (Table F.4). The results of the Hausman Test indicate that the coefficients under the fixed effects&#13;
model are more likely to be consistent, so a conditional fixed-effects logistic regression was used on the panel dataset.&#13;
This lead to the finding that social connectivity is more influential on funding outcomes than geographic connectivity (Table F.5).&#13;

Geographic centrality, measured as the average distance to all NYC startups, institutional investors, and incubators, was not&#13;
significant in our model. In alternative models, average distances to startups, institutional investors, and incubators was separated&#13;
out, but the effects were mixed and unreliable.26&#13;
However, it cannot be concluded that geographic centrality does not influence funding outcomes. Historical geographic data for&#13;
nodes was not available, so in order to test the influence of geographic connections on funding outcomes, it was assumed that&#13;
companies had been located in or near their current location since founding. In other words, only the latest address was available,&#13;
so in order to populate address data for previous years the assumption was made that the latest address was also the address at the&#13;
time of founding. It is likely that this assumption does not hold, and that is why the results are not significant.&#13;
Interestingly, the current number of second-order connections to investors also had an insignificant impact on funding outcomes&#13;
in the following year. These are investor connections available through the startup's founders, current employees, and past&#13;
employees. In other words, these second-order investors are connections that are "a phone call away" when a startup decides to&#13;
raise a round of funding.&#13;
It was hypothesized that the number of second-order connections to investors would influence funding outcomes, so this result&#13;
was surprising. However, given that our dataset is a more mature sample wherein most connections come from already receiving&#13;
funding, it is likely that it was not possible to tease out the incremental effect of more second-order connections to investors after&#13;
controlling for other investment-related variables because of an insufficient sample size of connections that occurred outside of&#13;
funding events.&#13;
What is significant is social momentum. The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors, the more likely they are&#13;
to successfully fundraise. In fact, each additional second-order connection to an investor increases the odds of raising funding in&#13;
the next year by approximately 2%. This finding is interesting because it suggests that startups can ride the coattails of fundraising&#13;
48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM&#13;
successes in their broader networks. Or, perhaps, combined with the finding that the absolute number of second-order connections&#13;
to investors is insignificant, this result might suggest that the "freshness" of a connection is important, or that the value of&#13;
connections possibly atrophies over time.&#13;
However, we should exercise caution in interpreting the social momentum findings given that our dataset is primarily comprised&#13;
of founders. What this means is that most second-order connections we observe are through founders and their previous&#13;
employers or through employees that have gone on to found companies of their own. As such, not only is the observed sample&#13;
of each startup's associated personnel probably limited in comparison to the actual number of founders, employees, mentors, and&#13;
advisors, the effect is probably overstated given that the average employee is unlikely to have the number and strength of investor&#13;
connections as our observed set of founders.&#13;
Finally, there are multiple nonconnectivity variables that are significant. A startup that has raised money this year is more likely&#13;
to raise money next year. The more years a startup has existed and the more employee connections it gains, the more likely it is&#13;
to raise funding. However, the more investments and investors a startup already has, the less likely it is to raise funding. This is&#13;
probably because startups reach a threshold where they are self-sustaining enough to slow their fundraising efforts.&#13;
Research finding #3: Social momentum matters. The faster a startup gains second-order connections to investors,&#13;
the more likely they are to successfully fundraise. We could not find a significant impact of geographic centrality&#13;
on funding outcomes.&#13;
Relationship Between Geographic and Social Dynamic&#13;
Research question #4: What is the relationship between geographic and social centrality?&#13;
Although the lack of historical location data prevents us from understanding how changes in geography impact the social dynamic,&#13;
an OLS linear regression enabled us to examine the relationship between geographic centrality and social centrality (Table F.6).2&#13;
TABLE F.6&#13;

Average Distance to NYC Incubators     +           ***                *     +            ***     +            *&#13;

= p &lt;0.01,** p &lt;005,*= p &lt;0.&#13;
While location alone does a poor job of explaining centrality,28 the closer a startup is to other startups, the higher the startup's&#13;
degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality. Meanwhile, the closer a startup is to investors, the higher the startup's closeness&#13;
centrality. This result suggests that startups closer to other startups may be highly connected but within an insular startup&#13;
community, while startups farther from other startups may be less connected but connected with a more diverse set of nodes.&#13;
Research finding #4: While startups in the geographic center of the startup scene may be highly connected, their&#13;
connections are not as socially diverse.&#13;
Discussion&#13;
Our findings suggest that incubators are key networking assets within the urban innovation ecosystem, and the social dynamic is&#13;
important for startups because increased social momentum can mean better chances of obtaining funding. However, our findings&#13;
also suggest that while startups in the geographic center of the startup scene may be highly connected, their connections are not as&#13;
socially diverse.&#13;
49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿APPENDIX F: ANALYSIS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ECOSYSTEM&#13;
However, without historical location data, we are unable to determine whether it is the social dynamic that influences the&#13;
geographic dynamic or the geographic dynamic that influences the social dynamic. Do incubators form where there is already a&#13;
critical mass of startup activity? Or are they the key players that build the social activity? Do startups form more connections when&#13;
they are located in the geographic center of activity? Or do they move into the center of the city after already having already made&#13;
the social connections?&#13;
To answer these questions, we must obtain more granular timestamps for social and geographic changes. It would be informative,&#13;
for example, to understand how many connections startups had before applying for incubation, and if it is the acceptance to the&#13;
incubator that spurred their relocation or if they moved into the center of the scene beforehand in the hope of attracting funding&#13;
and incubation.&#13;

19. Founding events were included as edges within the network because founders can found more than one startup, and as such founders&#13;
and startups are treated as separate nodes.&#13;
20. Numbers are obtained by dividing the total number of edges by the number of appropriate nodes. These numbers include relationships&#13;
with nodes outside of New York City.&#13;

21. The small number of startups located in Brooklyn is surprising. However, this may be explained by the fact that Brooklyn has not been&#13;
developed for as long as Manhattan, and our data is incomplete for recent years.&#13;
22. The average diameter and path length likely first increases as unrelated nodes were added into the network, then decreases when the&#13;
social graph "fills out" owing to better data population.&#13;
23. Diagrams are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality.&#13;
24. In addition to this specification, multiple alternative models were explored. A year fixed effect was considered, where we expected to&#13;
see effects in 2000 (dot-com boom) or 2008 (financial crisis), but no irregularity was detected. Likewise, there was no irregularity by&#13;
neighborhood. Other variables such as centrality measures for startups and employees and non-linear transformations of variables were&#13;
also considered. Regression outputs from these alternative models are available upon request.&#13;
25. Odds ratios tell us how many times more likely the outcome is to occur given a one-unit increase in the input variable. An odds ratio&#13;
greater than 1 indicates that the outcome is more likely to occur.&#13;
26. Results from these models are available upon request.&#13;
27. The social centralities are the dependent variables. The geographic centralities are the independent variables.&#13;
28. The R2 of the regressions is low. See footnotes 30-33 for more details.&#13;
29. Correlations become weaker and weaker as we move backwards in time. Effects do not hold &lt;2009, likely due to data population and the&#13;
likelihood that our locations are not historically accurate.&#13;
30. Adjusted R2 = 0.0273.&#13;
31. Adjusted R2 = 0.0031.&#13;
32. Adjusted R2 = 0.0237.&#13;

            Boosting tech innovation ecosystems in
            cities : a framework for growth and sustainability of urban
            tech innovation ecosystems
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Cities are emerging as hubs of
            technological innovation. This is characterized by an
            ongoing shift from technology parks in suburban areas, to
            entrepreneurial activity within cities. There is a global
            trend of startups in cities like Berlin, Buenos Aires,
            Mumbai and Madrid. The rise of technology startups in cities
            is leading to new sources of employment and economic growth,
            by creation of new businesses and employment categories.
            Traditional manufacturing and routine cognitive skills jobs
            are being eroded, and the creation of new sources of
            employment and growth is vital to maintain competitiveness,
            reduce poverty, and increase shared prosperity. The growth
            of tech innovation and entrepreneurship is not equal in all
            cities. Some cities experience higher, faster, and more
            sustainable growth than others. This paper discusses
            research on what factors make tech innovation and
            entrepreneurship ecosystems grow faster and larger in some
            cities. The findings point out that the social dimension, or
            the interpersonal connections and communities, are critical
            for the growth and sustainability of the ecosystem; and,
            that networking assets (defined as community building
            events, skill training events, collaboration spaces, and
            networking of mentors) are central to this social dimension.
            This paper includes a) proposed framework for urban
            technology innovation ecosystems based on this findings; b)
            testing of the framework in New York, and; c) policy
            implications of this findings.
