reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
A tracer evaluation was undertaken by the Evaluation Unit of EDI on the Water Reform Policy&#13;
Program (WPRP). Specifically, participants were surveyed from sixteen WPRP activities that were&#13;
conducted by EDI in various countries throughout the world between 1993 and 1997. The primary&#13;
source of evaluative data was from a questionnaire that was mailed to one hundred high-level&#13;
participants in various countries who had attended these programs. The questionnaires were also&#13;
translated into three languages: English, French, and Spanish. E-mails, follow-up letters, and phone&#13;
calls were utilized to encourage participants to complete the questionnaires. Twenty-eight&#13;
participants completed and returned the questionnaire which translates into a response rate of&#13;
twenty-eight percent. Although this is a lower response rate than expected, the twenty-eight&#13;
respondents were highly representative of the total population of the participants who had attended&#13;
various water reform programs conducted by EDIEN since 1993.&#13;
&#13;
The two primary goals of the evaluation were to assess the program's overall accomplishments since&#13;
its inception in 1993 and to provide suggestions for future improvements. To help accomplish the&#13;
evaluation objectives, the questionnaire addressed five areas: 1) Background information on the&#13;
respondents and their functions within their countries; 2) Respondents' ratings of the seminars they&#13;
attended; 3) Respondents' perception of how the situation had changed in their country since the EDI&#13;
activity they attended was held; 4) The current situation for water policy reforms in the respondent's&#13;
country; 5) Respondents' understanding of the role of EDI and The World Bank in water policy reform&#13;
throughout the world. These were the primary evaluation findings:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ·    Positive impacts were reported by many of the respondents. Forty-one percent of the&#13;
          respondents said that reforms in the area of water management policies had been initiated&#13;
          as a result of the activity they had attended. Forty-six percent stated their countries had&#13;
          either developed or revised new water laws and tariffs or new policies for water management&#13;
          in their countries.&#13;
&#13;
     ·    Fifty-nine percent of the respondents were satisfied with the quality of their country's&#13;
          decision-making on water policies. The specific reasons for this apparent satisfaction are not&#13;
          known. However, sixty-three percent of the respondents stated that the quality of decision-&#13;
          making on water sector reform had improved since they attended the activity.&#13;
&#13;
     ·    As a result of the WPRP there was also the perception of noticeable changes in attitudes of&#13;
          the respondents. When asked to suggest specific training programs necessary to implement&#13;
          effective and sustainable water management reforms in their countries, thirty-two percent of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  the respondents recommended training national staff and NGOs on pertinent issues of water&#13;
  policy reform. Forty-five percent suggested that EDI should conduct additional case studies&#13;
  and hold more workshops to help participant countries implement effective and sustainable&#13;
  water management reform.&#13;
&#13;
· The respondents also offered specific recommendations to improve the courses offered in&#13;
  the WPRP. The four top priority impacts which respondents recommended EDI should be&#13;
  aiming towards were: increasing implementation of sound policies for better management of&#13;
  the country's water resources (twenty percent); development of environmentally sustainable&#13;
  water and improved dialogue between stakeholders (both fourteen percent); and the need for&#13;
  privatization of water management for their countries (thirteen percent). As indicated by the&#13;
  respondents, the two top priority content areas that EDI should emphasize in the future for&#13;
  water management are strengthening national institutions (twenty-three percent), and&#13;
  increasing national capacity for training of sector specialists (seventeen percent).&#13;
&#13;
· Fifty-five percent of the respondents stated that learning about the experiences of other&#13;
  countries was the most useful aspect of the seminars for them. Correspondingly, twenty-five&#13;
  percent indicated that country presentations (i.e., presentations concerning their own&#13;
  country) were the least useful aspect.&#13;
&#13;
· Based on their experiences, the respondents cited that EDI programs on Water Policy need&#13;
  to be less focused on theory and more focused on concrete recommendations, seminars,&#13;
  case study discussions, field visits, and new technologies. Clearly, more "hands-on" and "in-&#13;
  person" experiences and better case study discussions seem to be warranted. The most&#13;
  frequent responses revealed that fifty-nine percent of the respondents believed that WPRP&#13;
  should be "more focused" on concrete recommendations, while twenty-six percent said that it&#13;
  needed to be "much more focused" on concrete recommendations. Fifty-six percent of the&#13;
  respondents stated that the program needs to be "more focused" on seminars, while&#13;
  nineteen percent said they needed to be "much more focused" on seminars. Fifty-two&#13;
  percent of the respondents noted that the case study discussions would help to make the&#13;
  program "more focused," while thirty percent said that case studies could help make it "much&#13;
  more focused." Forty-four percent of the respondents stated that WPRP should be "less&#13;
  focused" on theory, while thirty-seven percent were neutral saying it needed to be "not more,&#13;
  not less focused" on theory. In sum, WPRP needs to focus more on concrete&#13;
  recommendations, seminars, and case study discussions and less on theory.&#13;
&#13;
· The respondents rated the importance EDI had given to participants' involvement and the&#13;
  management and organization of the activities (fifty-nine percent of the participants rated&#13;
  both of these features as "very good") as the two best features of the seminars. However, a&#13;
  few respondents also gave a low rating to the importance given to participants' involvement&#13;
  (while fifty-nine percent rated this as "very good," another fifteen percent rated it only as&#13;
  "fair"). Some respondents were not satisfied with the duration of the activities (nineteen&#13;
  percent said this was "fair" while four percent rated it as "poor").&#13;
&#13;
· Respondents reported high satisfaction levels for the courses they attended. Sixty-one&#13;
  percent were satisfied with the seminar they had attended, while thirty-six percent were&#13;
  completely satisfied. Only one respondent (three percent) was neither satisfied nor&#13;
  dissatisfied.&#13;

            respondent's country; and 5) respondents'
            understanding of the role of EDI and the World Bank in water
            policy reform throughout the world.
