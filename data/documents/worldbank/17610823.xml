&amp;#12;                                           Introduction&#13;
The Little Data Book on Gender 2013 is a quick reference for users interested&#13;
in gender statistics. It presents gender-disaggregated data for more than 200&#13;
countries in a straightforward, country-by-country reference on demography,&#13;
education, health, labor force, political participation, and the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals. Summary pages that cover regional and income group&#13;
aggregates are also included.&#13;
&#13;
This third issue of The Little Data Book on Gender reflects the structure of the&#13;
World Development Report 2012 on Gender Equality and Development. The&#13;
report looked at the facts and trends surrounding the various dimensions&#13;
of gender equality in the context of the development process: although&#13;
many women around the world continue to struggle with gender-based&#13;
disadvantages, much has changed for the better and at a more rapid pace&#13;
than ever before. But that progress needs to be expanded, protected, and&#13;
deepened. While development has closed some gender gaps, other gaps&#13;
persist, including excess deaths of girls and women, disparities in girlsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
schooling, unequal access to economic opportunities, and differences in voice&#13;
within the household and in society. The report argues that gender equality can&#13;
enhance productivity, improve development outcomes for the next generation,&#13;
and make institutions more representative of groups in society. For more&#13;
information about this landmark report, visit www.worldbank.org/wdr2012.&#13;
&#13;
As part of its strategy to provide content when, where, and how users want&#13;
it, the World Bank now offers two new electronic products on gender. The&#13;
Gender Equality Data and Statistics Portal (data.worldbank.org/gender) is&#13;
a resource center for the latest gender-relevant data, with statistics from&#13;
various sources, tools, training materials, and reference documents covering&#13;
employment, education, health, public life and decision making, human&#13;
rights, and demographic outcomes for women and men, and girls and boys.&#13;
The Gender Data Finder mobile application for iOS, Android or Blackberry&#13;
allows users to browse and search gender-relevant and sex disaggregated&#13;
data by keyword, topic, region, and more. Visit http://data.worldbank.org/&#13;
apps for more information.&#13;

Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term country&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
The selection of indicators in these pages includes some of those being&#13;
used to monitor progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. For&#13;
more information about the eight goalsâ&#128;&#148;halving poverty and increasing&#13;
well-being by 2015â&#128;&#148;please see the other books in the World Development&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Each&#13;
economy in The Little Data Book on Gender is classified as low income,&#13;
middle income, or high income. Low- and middle-income economies are&#13;
sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is&#13;
convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are&#13;
experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a&#13;
preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not&#13;
necessarily reflect development status. Note: Classifications are fixed during&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal year (ending on June 30), thus countries remain in&#13;
the categories in which they are classified irrespective of any revisions to&#13;
their per capita income data.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less&#13;
in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$1,025 but less than $12,476. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-&#13;
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $4,036.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,496 or more.&#13;

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product&#13;
taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts&#13;
of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from&#13;
abroad. Data are in current U.S. dollars. GNI, calculated in national currency,&#13;
is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons&#13;
across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official&#13;
exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the&#13;
rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in&#13;
prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by&#13;
the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange&#13;
rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in&#13;
rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries&#13;
(France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From&#13;

            The little data book on gender 2013 is a
            quick reference for users interested in gender statistics.
            It presents gender-disaggregated data for more than 200
            countries in a straightforward, country-by-country reference
            on demography, education, health, labor force, political
            participation, and the millennium development goals. Summary
            pages that cover regional and income group aggregates are
            also included. This third issue of the little data book on
            gender reflects the structure of the world development
            report 2012 on gender equality and development. The report
            argues that gender equality can enhance productivity,
            improve development outcomes for the next generation, and
            make institutions more representatives of groups in society.
