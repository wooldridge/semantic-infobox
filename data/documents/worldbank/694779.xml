Aw, Marie-Helene Collion, Cornelis de Haan; Ibrahim Nebie, Emmanuel Nikiema, Sophie Revillion (World&#13;
Bank), and consultants Hannibal Muhtar and Pierre Rondot. The post-appraisal team benefitted from the&#13;
work done by the pre-appraisal team in March 1996 and the appraisal team in June 1996. The team was&#13;
assisted in the field by an extensive group of counterpart staff from the two Ministries involved in the project.&#13;
Messrs. Jean-Paul Chausse and Serge Michailof were the managing Technical Manager and Country Director,&#13;
respectively. Messrs. Franz Kaps (Operations Adviser) and Jerome Chevallier (Technical Manager, Operations&#13;
Support) have reviewed the document and provided operational advice. The Lead Adviser was Daniel Moreau&#13;
and the Peer Reviewers Derek Byerlee and V. Venkatesan. Brigitte Kerby-Kia provided operational support for&#13;
negotiations.&#13;

BURKINA FASO&#13;
SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Burkina Faso is a landlocked country, with its southern border more than 600 km from West&#13;
African ports. Covering an area of 274,000 square kilometers, Burkina Faso lies entirely in the Sudano-&#13;
Sahelian agroecological zone. With a GDP per capita of US$230 in 1995, Burkina ranks among the&#13;
world's poorest nations. Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy: it employs an estimated 80&#13;
percent of the population, generates more than 50 percent of the export earnings and contributes about 35&#13;
percent of GDP. Agriculture's share of GDP has, however, been gradually declining; for instance, in&#13;
1965 it was 53 percent. There is significant potential for agricultural growth in the range of&#13;
agroecologies that support specialization in different crops and farming systems. The Government has&#13;
realized the critical role of agriculture for the country's economic growth, food security and employment.&#13;
1.2   The population, estimated at 10 million in 1994, is growing at the rate of 2.8 percent per year.&#13;
The population density on arable land is high, and most rural people are engaged in low-input, low-&#13;
output agriculture on which their livelihood depends. The recently prepared Poverty Profile shows that&#13;
the incidence of poverty is highest among agricultural households. Thus, improving performance of the&#13;
agricultural sector is critical not only to fostering economic growth, but also to alleviating poverty.&#13;
1.3    Although Burkina Faso's agriculture has performed well during the past few years, its continuous&#13;
improvement will be crucial and substantial investment will be needed to meet this challenge. In 1989 the&#13;
Government requested IDA assistance in preparing an agricultural sector adjustment program to&#13;
modernize and diversify agricultural production, promote food security at the national, provincial, and&#13;
household levels, and improve natural resource management. Serious natural resource and environmental&#13;
problems led the Government to prepare a project on natural resource management, the Environmental&#13;
Management Project, which is supported by an IDA credit (Cr. 2229-BUR, 1991). It was followed by an&#13;
agricultural sector adjustment credit and several investment operations (para 2.30). The proposed Second&#13;
National Agricultural Services Development Project, which would be based on the work started under&#13;
two earlier projects (the Agricultural Research Project and Agricultural Services Project), would benefit&#13;
from the policy changes effected under the agricultural sector adjustment program and the projects&#13;
supporting it.&#13;
II. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1    Past performance. Despite difficult agroclimatic conditions, the growth of the agricultural&#13;
sector has been quite satisfactory in the latter part of the 1980s. The longer-term trend (1965 - 86) shows&#13;
a growth rate of 2.6 percent/year, which however was below the population growth rate of 2.8 percent.&#13;
Agricultural production markedly deteriorated in the 1970s, when the annual growth rate was 1.3&#13;
percent, but between 1984 and 1989, agriculture grew at an average annual rate of more than 5 percent.&#13;
Favorable rainfall in some recent years (despite irregularities in interseasonal distribution) has allowed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Burkina Faso to produce record crops, particularly in cereals. Rainfall variations are reflected in highly&#13;
variable growth rates between 1983 and 1994. Subsectoral growth (1983-8) and the trends in production&#13;
from 1989 to 1995 are summarized in Table 1.&#13;

2.2    Agroecological conditions. The country can be divided into four agroecological zones on the&#13;
basis of climate, soils and socioeconomic factors: Sahel, Central Plateau, Southwest and East. The Sahel&#13;
in the north is the driest region; its rainy season lasts two to three months a year, and average rainfall&#13;
varies from less than 400 mm to 600 mm. The dominant activity is livestock rearing. The Central&#13;
Plateau is the most densely populated zone. Average rainfall varies between 600 mm and 900 mm.&#13;
Environmental degradation is a major concern in this zone. Although economic activities are&#13;
concentrated on food production, the Central Plateau has experienced recurrent food deficits except in&#13;
years of exceptionally high and well distributed rainfall. The Southwest zone, where average rainfall&#13;
ranges from 800 mm to more than 1,200 mm, has the best agricultural potential. In an average year, it&#13;
not only supplies its own needs for food crops but can also devote 15 percent to 30 percent of the&#13;
cultivated area to cash crops, mainly cotton. Livestock activities are important for both the sedentary&#13;
farmers (for animal draft power and income from animal sales) and transhumant herders. The Eastern&#13;
Savanna is the least developed, and the least environmentally degraded area of the country. Average&#13;
raminfall there ranges from 600 mm to 900 mm.&#13;
2.3    Use of arable land. Of the 9 million hectares of arable land, about 3.7 million hectares are&#13;
cultivated each year. The average farm size is 4 hectares. Family size is the main determinant of farm&#13;
size, because most work is done with handtools and little hired labor is used. Only about one fourth of&#13;
the farns own draft animals or have equipment to use them. These are concentrated mainly in the cotton&#13;
areas. Use of tractors or power tillers is negligible.&#13;
2.4    The major crops, covering 84 percent of the crop area, are: coarse-grain cereals (sorghum, millet&#13;
and maize); other food crops, including rice (4 percent); and cash crops, mainly groundnuts, cowpea and&#13;
cotton (12 percent). Most of the sugar cane is grown in a single estate in the Southwest on a few hundred&#13;
hectares. As noted, agriculture can meet the country's need for staple food only in good rainfall years;&#13;
increasing quantities of rice have been imported since the late 1970s. Maize is the cereal that has the&#13;
best potential for increased production. Although cotton covers only 5 percent of the cultivated area, it&#13;
plays a major role in the economy, accounting for about one half of the total export revenues and&#13;
providing an important source of funds for the households in the areas where it is grown. Cotton area&#13;
and production increased steadily from 1968 to 1991, when a record production level of 190,000 tons of&#13;
seed cotton was reached. Unfavorable world market prices, overvaluation of CFAF and inadequate&#13;
credit and marketing services caused a downturn in production between 1991 and 1994. The devaluation&#13;
of CFAF in 1994 has provided farmers with better incentives to grow more cotton (its production in&#13;
1995 grew by 5.5 percent, but the estimation for 1996 is 36 percent) and other export crops, such as&#13;
green beans grown in valley bottom lands in the beginning of the dry season, and Karit6 (Butyrospermum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
parkii), also known as sheatree. The latter, which has been grown for centuries on farmers' fields,&#13;
provides valuable income for women, who extract butter from its nuts. Livestock, which accounts for&#13;
more than 10 percent of total export earnings, is the second most important item of agricultural exports&#13;
(mainly to the coastal countries). Fruits and vegetables have good development potential and are&#13;
increasingly important for nutrition. They are presently grown in small areas only.&#13;
2.5    Sector constraints. Although the potential for accelerated growth in agriculture remains&#13;
satisfactory, there also are problems. The growth of the sector is constrained particularly by five&#13;
physical factors: inadequate and uneven rainfall, low quality of soils, population pressure on land,&#13;
scarcity of groundwater resources, and imbalance between demand for fuelwood and the growth capacity&#13;
of vegetation. Other problems include the traditional system of land tenure, inadequate marketing&#13;
outlets, smallholders' weak purchasing power and the high cost of inputs, illiteracy, the traditional&#13;
undervaluation of women's work and the difficulty women have in getting agricultural services.&#13;
Additionally, less than 15 percent of smallholders have adopted new technology, and extension and&#13;
research linkages are inadequate. In the long run, the sustainability of the sector depends mostly on&#13;
increasing the productivity of smallholders rather than expanding the cultivated area.&#13;
2.6    Rainfall is low and irregular. The rainy season is short, lasting two to four months (depending&#13;
on the part of the country). The coefficient for annual rainfall variation, increasing from south to north,&#13;
ranges from 20 percent to 30 percent. Crop farming and pasture management are hazardous due to the&#13;
large variation in intraseasonal rainfall distribution. In these conditions, risk management is key to&#13;
farming and herding. Farmers, therefore, try to reduce risk by extending the cultivated area for crops and&#13;
feeding area for cattle rather than by intensifying their use of land. Moreover, average rainfall has been&#13;
declining since the early 1970s. Although there is no scientific evidence that this decline is a permanent&#13;
trend rather than a cyclical phenomenon, a comparison of the isohyets shows that they have moved south&#13;
about 200 kilometers between the 1950 - 1967 period and the 1968 - 1987 period. As a result, farmers&#13;
and herders have become even more risk averse and less disposed to adopting high-input or labor-&#13;
intensive technologies.&#13;
2.7    The soils in Burkina Faso are generally poor, and the structure is seriously depleted. In the&#13;
Central Plateau, the reduced vegetation cover has allowed the soils to become exposed to water erosion&#13;
(from runoff in the rainy season) and to wind erosion during the dry season. In addition, the soils&#13;
throughout the country are deficient in phosphorus. Because the use of fallow periods for soil recovery&#13;
is fast disappearing and because very little chemical fertilizer is used (less than 5 nutrient kg per hectare&#13;
annually), the soils are being rapidly mined.&#13;
2.8    Population pressure on good land is severe. Of the total area of about 27 million hectares, only&#13;
9 million hectares are arable--less than one hectare per person. This is too low for adequate agricultural&#13;
production, given the low-input technologies used. The pressure on land is most severe on the Central&#13;
Plateau, where about one half of the entire population lives. The average population density is about 60&#13;
persons per square kilometer, and as high as 100 persons per square kilometer in some areas. In this part&#13;
of the country, the practice of fallowing has almost completely disappeared. Because the population has&#13;
exceeded the carrying capacity of the land, spontaneous migration to the Southwest has taken place since&#13;
the 1980s. There, the population density had been much lower because of onchocerciasis (river&#13;
blindness), a disease that has now been eradicated by concerted international action. However, the newly&#13;
I/ About 65 percent of the country lies between the 500 and 800 isohyets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
settled areas are now in a danger of being degraded because of improper cropping and deforestation&#13;
practices.&#13;
2.9    Both surface and subsurface water resources are scarce. Irrigation is little developed; although&#13;
the irrigated surface has doubled since 1982, it still accounts for only I percent of total cultivated area.&#13;
The river systems have a short flooding period and become dry soon after the rains stop. Surface water&#13;
resources, including permanent and temporary watercourses, are difficult to tap because of the country's&#13;
flat topography. To have year-round surface-water irrigation under these conditions would require large&#13;
water reservoirs and thus large investments. There is also evidence that the underground water table is&#13;
falling as a result of lesser infiltration and higher runoff induced by deforestation. Fetching of water is&#13;
becoming increasingly time-consuming--this chore usually falls on women and children--taking a large&#13;
share of time from other agricultural activities.&#13;
2.10   There is a severe imbalance between the demand for wood and the regenerative capacity of the&#13;
vegetation. About 96 percent of all energy used by households, including urban households, is derived&#13;
from fuelwood collected from the dwindling forests and bush fallow. The imbalance is so severe that&#13;
farmers are forced to burn crop residues and cattle dung instead of recycling them to maintain soil&#13;
fertility.&#13;
2.11   Livestock sector. The most important constraints to the sedentary crop-livestock farmers is the&#13;
poor quality feed, especially in the dry season. For the pastoralists in the transhumant system, the&#13;
encroachment of cropping into formerly critical dry-season grazing areas undermines the entire&#13;
sustainability of the transhumant pastoralist system. Diseases and lack of financial management&#13;
experience of the commercial producers are major impediments to intensive pigs and poultry production.&#13;
In livestock research, the socio-economic effect of the technologies being developed has not been&#13;
assessed. In livestock extension, front-line staff suffers from lack of training in livestock technology and&#13;
appropriate tools to demonstrate such improved. The current system is not adequately equipped to supply&#13;
the specialized information needs of the pastoral and commercial sectors. For the veterinary services,&#13;
inadequate sanitary control and poor diagnostic support facilities, and for the private veterinarians the&#13;
lack of enabling environment are key constraints. The project would address these constraints.&#13;
B. Agricultural Organizations and Agencies&#13;
2.12   Agricultural research. The Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific&#13;
Research (MESSRS) oversees research activities, but guidance, coordination, planning, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of research activities are provided by the National Center for Scientific and Technological&#13;
Research (CRNST) and its Board of Governors. The actual research work is carried out by several&#13;
specialized research institutes. Among them, the Agricultural Research Institute (INERA) and the&#13;
Research Institute for Tropical Biology and Ecology (IRBET) are responsible for research in the&#13;
agricultural sector. The forestry program of ex-IRBET has been merged into INERA to form a new&#13;
institute, the Institut National de l'Environnement et des Rescherches Agricoles (INERA). The new&#13;
institute will collaborate with the Research Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology (IRSAT)&#13;
which is also based on two earlier institutes. 2Two of IRSAT's research programs, agroprocessing and&#13;
agricultural mechanization, are of interest to the present project. INERA has five research centers for the&#13;
2/ They are the Institut Burkinabe de l'Energie (IBE), the Laboratoire de biochimie et technologie&#13;
alimentaire (LBTA), and some of the old INERA's research programs (such as agricultural&#13;
engineering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
research work and one that provides training to researchers in addition to research it carries out in&#13;
support of the region's agriculture. Smaller field stations are linked with these centers. IRSATs&#13;
organizational and physical structure would be developed under the Second National Agricultural&#13;
Services Development Project (NASDP II).&#13;
2.13   Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal&#13;
Resources (AGRI-RA) has been in charge of the sectoral policy and overall development of the&#13;
agricultural sector since 1986, when the water and rural affairs were divided into two ministries. Matters&#13;
relating to cooperatives and other rural institutions were later transferred back to AGRI-RA. AGRI-RA&#13;
has 12 Directorates, most of which will be involved in the implementation of NASDP II. The primary&#13;
Directorates benefiting from the project would be the Directorate for Studies and Planning (DEP), in&#13;
charge of studies, planning, monitoring and evaluation of projects and agricultural statistics; the&#13;
Directorate of Agricultural Extension (DVA), responsible for extension dealing with crops, livestock and&#13;
the transformation of agricultural products the Directorates of Animal Industries (DPIA), responsible for&#13;
both the modern and traditional (pastoral) livestock sector; the Directorate for Veterinary Services&#13;
(DSV), dealing with the animal health delivery including the public health aspects of animal products;&#13;
and the Directorate for Promoting Cooperatives and Rural Legislation.&#13;
2.14   AGRI-RA is the main institution for planning agricultural and livestock production, providing&#13;
extension services to crop farmers and livestock producers; training agricultural and livestock&#13;
technicians; and carrying out adaptive research in the PAPEMs (Points d'Appui de Prevulgarisation et&#13;
d'Experimentation Multi-locale) planned by and implemented in collaboration with researchers of&#13;
INERA (Institut de l'Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles). Input distribution (including&#13;
improved seed, veterinary drugs and supplies, and agricultural chemicals) and the distribution of credit&#13;
also have been AGRI-RA's responsibilities. However, these two activities have recently been suspended.&#13;
These support services have been provided in practice by AGRI-RA's 12 Centres Regionaux de&#13;
Promotion Agro-Pastorale (CRPA), established in 1988 as successors to regional rural development&#13;
authorities (Organismes Regionaux de Developpement, ORD). The main activities of the CRPAs have&#13;
involved extension, monitoring, evaluation, support services and rural works. More recently, they have&#13;
also advised on the promotion of farmer institutions. CRPAs have provided their centralized services to&#13;
the three specialized units of the Ministry in each of the 30 Provinces (Service Provincial de&#13;
l'Agriculture--SPA; Service Provincial des Ressources Animales--SPRA; Service Provincial de&#13;
l'Organisation et de la Formation Professionnelle des Producteurs--SPOFPP). The level below the&#13;
provinces is the zones, where the village level agents also have their postings. Since AGRI-RA's&#13;
reorganization in 1997, the CRPAs have been replaced by the "Directions Regionales de l'Agriculture et&#13;
des Ressources Animales" (DRARAs). They are public agencies with no commercial operations, which&#13;
concentrate on the public services previously performed by the CRPAs (para 2.17).&#13;
2.15   Livestock Sector. AGRI-RA has overall responsibility for the development of the livestock&#13;
sector. At the national level, it has carried out this responsibility through: (a) the Directorate for Animal&#13;
Production and Livestock Industries (DPIA), which is responsible for livestock extension and the&#13;
promotion of the modem production systems; (b) the Directorate of Animal Health (DSA), responsible&#13;
for veterinary protection and quality control of food of animal origin; and (c) the Directorate of&#13;
Traditional Livestock Production (DOET), responsible for herder organizations, including the&#13;
development of special "pastoral zones." All three Directorates contribute to the training of the field&#13;
extension agents. In addition, there are a number of semiautonomous institutions in the sector. The&#13;
National Livestock Laboratory (LNE) and the National Distributor of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals&#13;
(ONAVET, to be privatized soon) are the most important of them. In the 1997 reorganization of AGRI-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
RA, the Service of Pastoral Area Promotion (SAEP) has replaced DOET and integrated with DPIA. The&#13;
Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) has replaced DSA.&#13;
2.16   At the regional level, livestock services are integrated with a Provincial Service (SPRA) which&#13;
implements the animal health programs and trains the extension agents at zone and village levels. These&#13;
three Directorates and agencies in the field involved in animal health and livestock extension have a total&#13;
staff of about 40 veterinarians, 70 livestock technicians and 250 field agents. This gives a ratio of about&#13;
one professional per 75,000 TLU (Tropical Livestock Unit), and 30,000 TLU per middle level staff,&#13;
which is not excessive. Since 1991, when recruitment by the public sector stopped, an active private&#13;
veterinary sector has developed. More than 50 veterinarians now operate privately (more than the&#13;
number of veterinarians employed in the public sector), covering a substantial part of the Burkina&#13;
livestock population.&#13;
2.17   Reorganization of AGRI-RA. During the process of preparing the Second National Agricultural&#13;
Adjustment Program (PASA II), an extensive plan to reorganize AGRI-RA has also been promoted.&#13;
With assistance from FAO, the Government has advanced, through a thorough process of planning and&#13;
participation by concerned and interested parties, to a level where implementation of the new organigram&#13;
and setting in place the other necessary changes were started in the beginning of 1997. The objectives of&#13;
the reorganizations program are to: (a) assure greater efficiency of the public sector activities in the&#13;
sector; (b) increase autonomy and improve professionalism of the economically-oriented farmer&#13;
organizations and facilitate their participation in the planning and evaluation of public services; and (c)&#13;
provide an enabling environment for the private sector to contribute to agricultural development more&#13;
than hitherto. The measures to achieve these objectives are several, including introduction of a new&#13;
organigram, detailed job descriptions and decentralization of staff and functions; reduction of staff in the&#13;
ministry (para 4.4); liquidation of the loss-making commercial activities of the CRPAs and providing&#13;
only purely public services through these regional bodies; and promotion of farmer organizations and&#13;
encouraging them to take over some of the activities earlier performed by CRPAs.&#13;
2.18   Farmer organizations. There are more than 10,000 registered farmer organizations and groups&#13;
(250 cooperatives and 10,627 precooperatives), in addition to groups that have been formed informally,&#13;
for example, for agricultural extension and other purposes. However, the horizontal and vertical&#13;
structures of farner organizations, common in more developed countries, have yet to be developed.&#13;
Over the years, farmer organizations and groups have been formed following different promotion and&#13;
investment programs supported by the Government, international assistance agencies and local and&#13;
international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To facilitate centralized services and broader than&#13;
local-level representation, some of these initiatives have led to the development of a vertical organization&#13;
for some cooperative and other farmer organizations and to some expansion of the horizontal network of&#13;
groups supported by the various initiatives. Examples of the national and provincial organizations are&#13;
the Federation of Naam groups, Cooperative Union for Vegetable Growers (UCOBAM) and Federation&#13;
Wendyam. However, these organizations and groups may not reflect real indigenous membership&#13;
dynamism, but rather the policies and programs of external forces or groups with religious and political&#13;
aspirations.&#13;
2.19   Nevertheless, although still relatively fragmented and uneven, the network of cooperatives and&#13;
other farmer groups forms a basis on which genuine participatory development can be built. The&#13;
Government has declared a policy of disengagement of the state from cooperative management and&#13;
control, and empowerment of the producers as one of its main tenets of agricultural development. This&#13;
policy is expected to be the cornerstone of the Government's approach and a condition of the donor&#13;
community's support to facilitate accelerated development. This means that the Government and donors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
would: (a) help create a regulatory environment (including suitable laws and regulations) that promote&#13;
self-help activities; and (b) would supply the new or growing organizations with what they need for&#13;
successful expansion. The assistance to be provided under this project (para 4.16) is based on this&#13;
policy.&#13;
2.20   Liaisons. The Ministries implementing the project (AGRI-RA and MESSRS) plan to maintain&#13;
liaison with several other ministries to coordinate the project activities with other operations taking place&#13;
in the rural sector. The ministries involved are the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Economy,&#13;
Finance and Planning, Ministry of Water Resources, and Ministry of Basic Education and Mass Literacy.&#13;
2.21   Numerous other agencies are concerned with agricultural production, including the Societ6 des&#13;
Fibres et des Textiles (SOFITEX) for cotton, the Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole (CNCA) for&#13;
medium-term credit, the S6cretariat Permanent de Coordination de la Politique Cerealiere for cereal&#13;
production and the Secretariat Permanent de Coordination de la Politique de la Developpement de&#13;
l'Elevage for livestock. The Secretariat Permanent de Coordination du PASA (Programme&#13;
d'Adjustement du Secteur Agricole) would monitor the proposed reorganization of AGRI-RA (see para&#13;
4.18).&#13;
C. Development and Agricultural Policies and Sector Development Strategy&#13;
2.22   Development and agricultural sector policies and objectives. Agriculture is the mainstay of&#13;
the economy. Since the early 1 980s, the Government has followed a policy of agricultural development&#13;
that aims at achieving food security, improving the incomes of the rural population, and protecting the&#13;
environment. In 1985 the country endorsed the goals of intensification and diversification of agricultural&#13;
production and improved management of natural resources and the performance of agricultural research.&#13;
These goals were followed up by special programs for agricultural extension, research and community-&#13;
based land management (Gestion des Terroirs).&#13;
2.23   Beginning in 1985, the development strategies for agricultural research were implemented on the&#13;
basis of a policy paper titled "Lignes Directrices d'Organisation et d'Administration Strategique de&#13;
Recherches Agricoles." It emphasized agricultural research on farming systems; soil and water&#13;
management; and production of traditional cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, rice and cotton, as well as&#13;
animal husbandry. Among the achievements during this period were: development and adaptation of&#13;
improved and disease-resistant crop varieties and preparation of appropriate technical programs for&#13;
growing of them; improved knowledge of the physical environment and identification of improved water&#13;
management techniques; development of appropriate farming tools and postharvest processing&#13;
equipment; studies on farm budgets and production constraints; development of techniques for&#13;
multiplication of tree plants; creation of an ethno-botanical data bank; and quantification of natural&#13;
pastures and development of improved rations for intensive sheep production for small holders.&#13;
2.24  In 1991 the Government adopted a Structural Adjustment Program to improve the&#13;
competitiveness of the economy and establish a basis for sustainable development. The actions under&#13;
this program concerned the fiscal policy, scope of the public sector, reform of the banking sector, reform&#13;
of tariffs and trade policies and liberalization of prices. Realizing the priority that had to be accorded to&#13;
the agricultural sector in the new development approach, the Government had prepared already in 1992 a&#13;
special adjustment program for this sector and obtained for its implementation an adjustment credit from&#13;
IDA and financial assistance from other development partners (para 1.3). The policy paper approved at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
that time3 emphasizes three objectives for the agriculture sector: (a) modernizing and diversifying&#13;
agricultural production; (b) strengthening food security; and (c) improving natural resources&#13;
management. Three strategies were adopted to attain these objectives: (a) further intensification of&#13;
production and improved management of natural resources; (b) liberalization of marketing and prices;&#13;
and (c) restructuring the institutional environment through: (i) redefining of the role of the state,&#13;
including the disengagement of the state from functions that can be done by other sectors of society; (ii)&#13;
identifying the operators for rural and agricultural financing; and (iii) providing farmers' socioeconomic&#13;
organizations with an expanded role; (d) making more effective use of the public finances; and (e)&#13;
consolidating the policy and strategies of food security for the nation.&#13;
2.25   At present, the policies of the Government for the agronastoral sector are set forth in separate&#13;
documents on agricultural research, extension, organization and staff training, land ownership and&#13;
natural resources, and equipment and infrastructure. In addition, the Government is planning to&#13;
reorganize the agricultural services in line with the strategies expressed in the policy documents.&#13;
Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), farmer organizations and private entrepreneurs are expected to&#13;
take over selected activities that have hitherto been carried out by the state. Such a reorganization would&#13;
be gradual to ensure that those assuming the new functions are capable of doing so. (The intention of the&#13;
Government to follow the restructuring policies has been expressed in a "letter of intention" sent to the&#13;
World Bank. However, in the project preparation report the Government has suggested that the farmer&#13;
organizations restructure themselves into stronger units to take over the functions of the Government&#13;
agencies. Thus, farmer organizations must demonstrate that they are capable of providing the needed&#13;
services).&#13;
2.26   The development strategies also emphasize that increased productivity shall be based on&#13;
smallholder production and promotion of smallholders' participation in development activities. In&#13;
addition, durable agricultural development requires diversified interventions and concentration on local-&#13;
level development, which can happen only if administrative structures and responsibilities are&#13;
sufficiently decentralized.&#13;
2.27   In 1995 the Government approved a new strategy paper ("Plan Strategique de Recherches&#13;
Agricoles"-- PSRA) to guide agricultural research. The new strategy covers the planning, programming&#13;
and coordination of all agricultural research carried out by different research institutions, technical&#13;
ministries, projects and NGOs in Burkina Faso. Its principal objectives and strategies are to: (a) achieve&#13;
food self-sufficiency and food security, particularly through increases in agropastoral and forestry&#13;
products; (b) improve the income and welfare of smallholders through intensification and diversification&#13;
of agricultural production; and (c) conserve and restore natural resources through better policies and soil&#13;
management practices. In addition, specific objectives in the environment sector, aim at controlling the&#13;
pressure on natural resources, protecting biodiversity and initiating the process of reaching sustainability&#13;
in the use of renewable resources.&#13;
2.28   Bank Group Assistance Strategy. In its Letter of Intent for Sustainable Human Development&#13;
in October 1995, the Government set out its vision of socio-economic development, declaring poverty&#13;
alleviation as its long-term goal and focusing on achieving monitorable progress in three objectives, viz.:&#13;
(a) increasing income opportunities and productive capacity; (b) developing the social sector through a&#13;
more efficient use and better targeting of public expenditure, especially for poor and women; and (c)&#13;
strengthening the role of the private sector. Subsequently, the Bank started preparing a new Country&#13;
/ La lettre de Politique de Developpement Agricole (LPDA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was presented to Board in July 1996. The preparation process was&#13;
marked by a participatory policy dialogue between the Bank and Burkina Faso and resulted in a broad&#13;
commonality of views on the necessity to tackle poverty alleviation much more ambitiously than in the&#13;
past. The Bank Group's assistance strategy is focused on supporting the Government's goals of: (a)&#13;
maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment in which equitable growth will lead to poverty&#13;
reduction; (b) expanding the provision of social services to the poorest regions, particularly in health and&#13;
education; and (c) improving productive opportunities to raise incomes and employment. To support&#13;
these objectives, the strategy will strive to continuing structural reforms in agriculture, liberalizing the&#13;
gold sector, completing the banking sector reforms, and improving public sector management. IDA&#13;
assistance will be increasingly directed to non-lending services to improve targeting of public&#13;
expenditures and identification of sources of growth. The bulk of IDA's financial assistance in the three&#13;
coming years would concentrate on social sectors (education and health), and on creating and supporting&#13;
a more favorable environment in which growth opportunities can be realized (agriculture, natural&#13;
resources management, mining, water and infrastructure).&#13;
2.29   In its support to Burkina Faso's agriculture sector, the Bank Group intends to help the&#13;
Government implement policy changes to further liberalize the sector, improve delivery of public&#13;
services and develop a gender-sensitive extension program. In addition, through intensified economic&#13;
dialogue and collaboration with other donors, the Bank Group will help find sustainable sources of&#13;
growth for the sector and resources to finance their exploitation. Under this strategy, the Bank Group&#13;
anticipates financing a second Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC II). It would support the&#13;
completion of the reforms started earlier to liberalize the sector (on rice, sugar, cotton, trade and&#13;
domestic prices) and reforms in the public sector (public divestiture, public investment program and&#13;
restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture). Regarding the restructuring of AGRI-RA, there is a strong&#13;
linkage between ASAC 11 and the Second National Agricultural Services Development Project (NASDP&#13;
II--the object of this report).4 While the process of restructuring would be included in ASAC 11, it would&#13;
be followed through with the assistance provided under NASDP 11, which has a special component for&#13;
the purpose (para 4.16). The Bank Group also plans to support long-term agricultural growth and to&#13;
explore new growth opportunities by starting to prepare, in close collaboration with the Government and&#13;
donor agencies, an Agricultural Sector Growth Strategy.&#13;
D. IDA-Financed Agricultural Projects and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.30   In the first part of the 1990s the World Bank Group financed the following projects in Burkina&#13;
Faso's agricultural and environment sector: Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1896-BUR), Agricultural&#13;
Services Project (Cr. 1979-BUR), Environmental Management Project (Cr. 2229-BUR) and Food&#13;
Security and Nutrition Project (Cr. 2414-BUR). The first two projects will close at the end of 1996 and&#13;
1997, respectively. The total IDA financing for these projects is US$83.9 million. In addition, IDA has&#13;
financed an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2381-BUR) of US$28 million.&#13;
4 / Another project that would benefit from the liberalization efforts and is complementing NASDP 11 is the&#13;
proposed Private Irrigation Project for smallholders, to be appraised in FY 1997.&#13;
5/ Along with the IDA-financed programs, several other donors support agricultural and rural development&#13;
projects. The most important programs are supported by the French, Dutch, German and Danish bi-lateral&#13;
agencies and by European Union, IFAD and ADB. The projects supported by them are typically area-specific,&#13;
integrated rural development projects, with only a relatively small part of the financing directed to agricultural&#13;
extension. Some of these projects are implemented by Government agencies, others by separate implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.31   Although major results have been achieved, agricultural research has had limited impact&#13;
because of: (a) the lack of a participatory approach for research design and testing; (b) the weak linkage&#13;
with extension and end-users; (c) the inadequate attention paid to some important subsectors and to&#13;
postharvest techniques; and (d) some organizational and management issues relating to INERA's&#13;
responsibilities and decision-making powers affecting implementation of the agricultural research&#13;
project. As for extension, actions plans have been improving, but several concerns mentioned by the&#13;
1992 midterm review remain: (a) weak linkages between research and extension, along with a inadequate&#13;
participatory diagnosis; (b) insufficient supervision and technical back-up of the front-line extension&#13;
workers by the project's high-level staff; (c) a tendency to institutional over-staffing coupled with&#13;
insufficient presence in the field; (d) delays in implementing impact studies; and (e) weak financial&#13;
transparency and budgetary control at the decentralized level (CRPAs). An action plan is now being&#13;
implemented to address these concerns; it would be pursued further under the proposed project.&#13;
2.32   In December 1994, OED issued a report on lessons and practices conceming agricultural&#13;
extension on the basis of experience from Bank-funded projects throughout the world. It identified the&#13;
following critical points, which apply well to phase I and are being taken into account in the follow-on&#13;
project: (a) limited state fiscal capacity and commitment; (b) specific requirements of different groups&#13;
of potential clients; (c) need to adapt the methods of technology transfer to the specific characteristics of&#13;
beneficiaries and production systems; (d) analysis of existing and potential stock of adapted technologies&#13;
by type of production system; (e) prioritization of extension activities by client groups and region,&#13;
according to the available technology; (f) importance of gender issues in the effectiveness of technology&#13;
transfer; (g) potential usefulness of mass media and information technology; (h) importance of&#13;
participatory diagnoses and linkages with research; and (i) importance of using the potential of private&#13;
agencies or organizations to provide extension services.&#13;
2.33   To study the situation in Burkina Faso, two detailed evaluations of the perforrnance and impact&#13;
of extension services have been carried out by independent consultants in 1991 and 1995. The first&#13;
evaluation took place one year after the country had adopted the T&amp;V system. It showed that (a) contact&#13;
group members had yields that were 20 percent to 30 percent higher than in the control group; (b)&#13;
farmers who were not official contact farmers also participated in demonstration meetings; (c) 46&#13;
percent of the sample farmers rated the extension messages as highly applicable, while another 53&#13;
percent rated them as applicable; (d) 20 percent of contact group members and 8 percent of all farmers&#13;
mentioned that they were involved in on-farm research. However, this study also uncovered areas where&#13;
improvements were needed. About 70 percent of contact group members desired that more messages&#13;
focus on animal health and production, 70 percent of members expressed a need for more messages that&#13;
relate to organic matter, anti-erosion methods and water management and 47 percent of them wanted&#13;
more messages for horticulture. The second study, beneficiar,y assessment carried out in 1995,&#13;
confirmed in general that the contact farmers are in general satisfied with the extension services offered.&#13;
The farmers were forceful, however, in their insistence that the agricultural research and extension need&#13;
units as self-standing projects, but, in general, they follow the approved Government policies in regard to rural&#13;
development or agricultural extension.&#13;
In the area of agricultural research, the most active donors are the Dutch Cooperation (CFAF 226 million in the&#13;
next three years) and the European Community (CFAF 196 million in the next two years). Sofitex provides&#13;
INERA with FCFA 100 million a year over a longer period, mainly for cotton research. Researchers also have&#13;
an access to small individual funds that can complement, in a flexible manner, the operating expenses&#13;
budgeted under the IDA Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
to be directed more to diversification of messages and making them fully relevant to their requirements&#13;
and constraints.&#13;
2.34  In addition, the following "best-practice" documents from other countries have been reviewed&#13;
and their lessons considered during project appraisal: The World Bank: Agricultural Extension in Africa&#13;
Discussion Paper AFT Series No. 231, 1994; The World Bank: Agricultural Research in an Era of&#13;
Adjustment Policies, Institutions and Progress. EDI Seminar Series, 1995; and The World Bank:&#13;
Implementation Completion Report on Kenya National Agricultural Research Project, 1995.&#13;
III. AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SYSTEM&#13;
3.1    Agricultural Technology Support System. The main institutions involved in agricultural&#13;
technology development in Burkina Faso are the Agricultural Research Institute (INERA) (including the&#13;
Tropical Agricultural and Foodcrops Research Institute, IRBET, merged with INERA in 1997), universities&#13;
and the network of Pre-extension Experimentation Stations (PAPEMs). INERA and the new IRSAT have&#13;
a critical role in applied research, benefiting from the basic research done by the international research&#13;
institutes, advanced research agencies in developed countries and, to a limited extent, the universities. For&#13;
purposes of farming system research and coordination, the country is divided into five agro-ecological&#13;
zones, each serviced by one of INERA's Regional Stations that have responsibility for zone-specific&#13;
adaptive research and, to a certain extent, for conveying the findings to the extension and farming&#13;
community. Within each zone the PAPEMs conduct adaptive research and help disseminate research&#13;
results to smallholder farmers. PAPEMs are not directly linked to INERA but are part of the agricultural&#13;
extension structure. However, collaboration between the PAPEMs and the research stations is active.&#13;
3.2    Thus, there are several tiers of technology development and dissemination: (a) on-farm applied&#13;
research (OFR) using the farming systems teams of INERA's regional stations; (b) on-farm adaptive&#13;
research (OFAR) by the PAPEMs and other state-level agencies; and (c) technology dissemination through&#13;
the unified extension system using the Training and Visit (T&amp;V) methodology of extension management.&#13;
3.3    On-Farm Applied Research (Researcher-managed Adaptive Research). Applied research is&#13;
conducted by the farming system research and natural resource management teams of INERA's regional&#13;
research stations to develop appropriate technologies. This type of research involves researcher-managed&#13;
experiments to develop new and improved technologies under various agro-ecological conditions. The&#13;
purpose for research and extension teams is to learn how farmers react to introduced changes, to what&#13;
extent the introductions are accepted, modified, or rejected, and why farmers respond to new technologies&#13;
the way they do. Specific experiments are carried out at research farms, PAPEM farms or on farmers'&#13;
fields with as much control of the variables as possible. Combining the understanding of the farming&#13;
systems practiced by farmers, the background information on technology development and interaction with&#13;
farmers, the researcher teams propose improvements to increase the productivity and profitability of the&#13;
farming systems.&#13;
3.4    On-Farm Adaptive Research (OFAR). OFAR serves as the bridge between the development and&#13;
extension of new technologies. It is used by the extension system and its Regional Centres for Agro-&#13;
pastoral Promotion (CRPAs) as the first stage in the technology dissemination process. The technologies&#13;
generated from the OFAR recommendations are further tested. Farmers fully participate in these tests, so&#13;
that they can adapt them to specific farming situations based on farmers' resource base, technical abilities,&#13;
cropping and livestock patterns and farm/household conditions. The OFAR methodology ensures the&#13;
acceleration of the adoption of proven technologies; at the same time, it helps to better prepare extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
staff on technologies they promote during the mass diffusion stage. It entails more work on farmers' fields,&#13;
generally utilizing less expensive staff. It also requires increased expenditures in vehicle purchase and&#13;
maintenance, field equipment, elementary agricultural mechanization, multiplication of improved planting,&#13;
livestock and fisheries materials as well as simple tools for the trials, daily allowances and incentives. Due&#13;
to resource constraints, most of the CRPAs (presently DRARAs) are yet to implement the OFAR approach.&#13;
3.5    Technology Dissemination. The dissemination of most agricultural technologies to small-scale&#13;
farmers takes place through the Training and Visit System (T&amp;V). It is the responsibility of the DRARAs&#13;
under the reorganized and unified extension service. The entire country is currently using the T&amp;V&#13;
extension management system, with about 1,000 Base Extension Agents (CAPs) working at the village&#13;
levels with CAP-to-farmer ratios typically ranging between 1:800 and 1: 1,200. In each zone of the&#13;
DRARA, extension staff have delineated the farming areas into contiguous operational units (circles).&#13;
Within these circles, the extension agent works with selected groups of farmers. These farmers are the&#13;
"'official" contact group representing the rest of the farmers in the community. The contact groups also&#13;
provide the upward linkage from farmers to extension and research. The CAPs, supervised by 145 Zonal&#13;
Extension Supervisors, visit the contact groups and other farmers in the sub-circle at regular fortnightly&#13;
intervals. During the visits, the CAPs teach the farmers a maximum of three to four carefully chosen&#13;
production recommendations that they have learned at Fortnightly Training Sessions (FNTSs). Thus,&#13;
under the unified extension approach, a single field-level extension agent, supervised by a zonal officer and&#13;
backed by 150 Technical Specialists (TSs) specialized in subject matters typical for the region, is the&#13;
farmers' principal contact for the dissemination of all agricultural technologies. There is a team of 4 to 6&#13;
TSs in each Province.&#13;
3.6    The placement of TSs within the DRARAs helps bridge the gap between the generation of&#13;
technologies by researchers and the broad-scale diffusion of improved technologies by extension staff.&#13;
The TSs are specialists in such fields as agronomy, agroforestry, plant protection, livestock, farm&#13;
management, fisheries, water management and farm implements (agricultural mechanization). Because&#13;
the CAPs are generalists, TSs are more cost-effective, if used for training CAPs, than if they were used&#13;
as individual specialists working at the farmer level. Unification of extension is of critical importance&#13;
given that, in a large majority of farms, livestock, agro-forestry and crop production and processing are&#13;
integrated into a single farming system at the farm level. Exceptions are the nomadic pastoral and the&#13;
intensive peri-urban livestock production systems which have specialized information needs. In&#13;
addition, the front-line staff of the livestock service handles still a combination of control and advisory&#13;
functions. It appears that the control functions take a large portion of the staff's time, thus interfering&#13;
with the relationship of trust that needs to exist between the extension agent and his client farmers.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale, Objectives and Strategy&#13;
4.1    Rationale for IDA involvement. The proposed four-year project would continue the financial&#13;
support started by the Bank Group under the National Agricultural Research Project and the National&#13;
Agricultural Extension Project. In the field of research, the Bank is committed to support the Framework&#13;
for Action (FFA) of SPAAR (Special Program for African Agricultural Research). At the 15th SPAAR&#13;
Conference (March 1995), Burkina Faso was identified as part of the next round of FFA implementation.&#13;
The Bank is also committed to long-term support of integrated agricultural services in sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. The proposed credit represents the second phase of support for these commitments in Burkina&#13;
Faso. The project is consistent with the national strategy for agricultural development, in particular with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
the LPDA, and with the Country Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso. Approved in July 1996, the CAS&#13;
stresses the need for prudent management of natural resources, explicitly supports the continuation of the&#13;
ongoing research, agricultural services and natural resource management programs, and includes&#13;
Agricultural Services II in the lending program. The CAS also emphasizes that the incidence of poverty,&#13;
being highest in the agricultural sector, can only be reduced through efforts to create sustained growth in&#13;
this sector (para 2.28).&#13;
4.2    Objectives. In coordination with the institutional reforms to be undertaken in the context of the&#13;
proposed Second Agriculture SECAL, this project would seek to reduce rural poverty by helping&#13;
increase smallholder production through provision of essential services and strengthening the link&#13;
between agricultural research and extension. The project aims to: (a) support long-term agricultural&#13;
production by maintaining an agricultural research system and reorganizing it to better meet farmers' needs,&#13;
including postharvest activities, placing greater emphasis on protection of the environment and integrating&#13;
research more closely into the regional and internationalnetworks; (b) increase agricultural and livestock&#13;
productivity and farmers' revenues through improved agricultural extension services and empowering&#13;
rural women, whose role is critical in agricultural production, food processing and nutrition; (c) improve&#13;
natural resource management and promote sustainable production systems; (d) help the Government&#13;
implement an improved animal health system, largely based on private veterinary services; (e) promote&#13;
and empower, on a pilot basis, representative farmers' organizations that would (i) develop their know-&#13;
how in providing services and increase their bargaining power in their participation in agricultural policy&#13;
making and execution; (ii) help their members to gain confidence and capabilities to embrace technical&#13;
change; and (iii) share on-farm work with the public sector in the field of adaptive research and&#13;
technology transfer. In addition, the project would support a pilot program to study the feasibility of&#13;
financing village-based initiatives ("small rural infrastructures").&#13;
4.3    Project strategy. The project would support the Government's strategy of upgrading the rural&#13;
development services. Its design has benefited from the lessons learned from experience in neighboring&#13;
countries (paras 2.32) and it is in line with the new generation of agricultural services projects supported&#13;
by the World Bank in West Africa. Each of the lessons learned in Burkina Faso during the&#13;
implementation of the Agricultural Extension Project (PRSAP) and National Agricultural Research&#13;
Project (PNRA) has been considered in the project design (Para 2. 33). Farmers opinions expressed in&#13;
the evaluation study of 1991 and beneficiary assessment of 1995 will be addressed in this project,&#13;
especially as they relate to more diversified extension messages, messages for livestock owners and&#13;
water and natural resource management.&#13;
4.4   Implementation of NASDP II would coincide with the restructuring of AGRI-RA involved in&#13;
direct support to farmers. In AGRI-RA the restructuring process concerns about 4,100 staff, including&#13;
1,000 field staff working in the current IDA supported Agricultural Extension Project. After&#13;
restructuring, about 3,100 staff would have been deployed in the various organs of the Ministry, with&#13;
much higher emphasis on field postings than earlier. After the staff is replaced, there would be an&#13;
overall surplus of staff, most of them now employed under contract. This means that nearly all&#13;
contractual staff would have to be laid off, even taking retirements into account. The rights of the laid-&#13;
off employees would be determined by the law in effect at the time of severance. To enable the&#13;
individual staff members to adapt quickly to their new responsibilities, targeted training would be&#13;
provided from the start of the project.&#13;
4.5    On the side of agricultural research, the project's effectiveness depends largely on the legal and&#13;
administrative environment in which the research agencies operate. A new decree organizing CRNST&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
and its institutes has been elaborated to better define the responsibilities between these agencies. The&#13;
Council of Ministers approved it before negotiations.&#13;
4.6.   Because resources and implementation capacity are limited, agricultural development initially&#13;
requires a project approach. However, once the implementation agencies have gained sufficient planning&#13;
and institutional capacity to plan and implement the required development investments in a sector,&#13;
financing of development needs can also be done by using an investment program approach. Under the&#13;
latter approach, the implementation agencies receive funds for mutually agreed purposes (programs)&#13;
rather than for investments decided in advance. It is possible that this approach could be used in Burkina&#13;
Faso during the project implementation period. Therefore, before midterm, project funds would be used&#13;
to prepare a study on the capacity to plan and implement a program approach.&#13;
4.7    Project area. The project would cover the whole country, encompassing all five agroecological&#13;
zones with wide variations in population, climate, soils and vegetation. The different activities under the&#13;
project would be concentrated somewhat differently in the four zones. Whereas agricultural extension&#13;
would cover the entire country relatively evenly, much of the livestock component, particularly&#13;
assistance to the transhumant herders, would be in the North and East. The research component, with its&#13;
regional centers and field stations, would cover the whole country. The pilot component promoting&#13;
fanner organizations and small rural infrastructures would probably start in the agriculturally more&#13;
advanced areas and then expand to other regions.&#13;
B. Summary Description&#13;
4.8    The project has five main components:&#13;
1. Agricultural research: Ongoing priority research programs would continue to be supported by&#13;
the project. In line with the national Agricultural Research Strategic Plan, the project would pay&#13;
greater attention to promising new fields of research such as vegetable and food production,&#13;
forestry, postharvest technology and appropriate mechanization;&#13;
2. Agricultural extension (rainfed and irrigated crops, livestock natural resource management):&#13;
The project would help consolidate and expand the national system of extension and adaptive&#13;
research and incorporate gender-specific and literacy programs to support the effectiveness of&#13;
the extension program;&#13;
3. Animal health and pastoralist promotion: the project would help promote privatization of the&#13;
animal health subsector, improve the remaining public sector services and contribute to enhanced&#13;
development and distribution information to transhumant pastoral producers;&#13;
4. Pilot programs: (a) Promotion offarmer organizations: On a pilot basis the project would help&#13;
national, regional and local farmer organizations gain professional and financial strength so that&#13;
they can provide services to smaliholders and take part in adaptive research, and, potentially,&#13;
become able to transfer technologies and know-how to their members. Also, on pilot basis, the&#13;
project would finance: (b) a program for small rural infrastructures to study the processes and&#13;
feasibility of financing village-level operations intended for communal usage; and&#13;
5. Restructuring of agricultural services: In line with the Agriculture SECAL II appraised in June&#13;
1996, the project would carry out relevant supporting measures, including possibly setting up a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
temporary unit in charge of restructuring, carry out detailed studies for the reorganization of&#13;
AGRI-RA, and provide training for both redundant and remaining staff.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
4.9    Agricultural Research (US$18.8 million, including contingencies). 6 Funding for research&#13;
activities assumes that the 125 researchers now available would begin or continue the activities&#13;
envisaged under the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research. These researchers are located at INERA&#13;
and IRSAT. The project would continue to support the ongoing priority programs. In line with the&#13;
Strategic Plan, the project would also cover new areas of research such as research on forestry, farm&#13;
mechanization and postharvest technologies. Great attention would be paid to the most promising lines&#13;
of research, such as vegetable and fruit production. The project would contribute to improving the&#13;
relevance of research from the farmers' viewpoint, quality and accountability for results, and logistical&#13;
and financial management of CNRST and its specialized institutes, as well as the degree of autonomy for&#13;
the latter. The project would particularly focus on participatory technology development with producer&#13;
organizations and extension services.&#13;
4.10   NASDP II would finance construction of a few additional buildings or rehabilitation of buildings&#13;
to complement and consolidate the infrastructure development of the predecessor project, that is, only on&#13;
the sites that were part of the first project. They concern the principal the research centers of Kamboinse,&#13;
Saria, Farakoba, Dori-Katchari, Di-Tougan, Kouare, and the research station of Niangoloko. The project&#13;
would help CNRST recruit or continue to finance 15 contract researchers, 33 technicians and 10&#13;
technical or administrative staff. Several of the administrative staff would be needed to implement the&#13;
new financial and accounting system developed under the predecessor project. This staff would&#13;
progressively become regular CNRST staff, so that by the end of the project, the IDA credit would no&#13;
longer finance salaries, except for a few staff directly related to the project. The project would provide&#13;
agricultural and scientific equipment and contribute to the funding of research-related direct and indirect&#13;
costs, including managerial costs; long- and short-term training; and costs associated with developing&#13;
linkages between agricultural research, extension services and producer organizations.&#13;
4.11   Agricultural and livestock extension (US$20.3 million). The extension component covers&#13;
extension for rainfed and irrigated crops, livestock production, and natural resource management. The&#13;
project would help consolidate the national system of extension by improving the capacity for regional&#13;
and local diagnoses, to be carried out with full participation of the benefiting farmers; strengthening&#13;
linkages between research and extension to ensure the appropriateness and effectiveness of extension to&#13;
farmers; continuing training and support to field extension staff, as well as the supervision of the mobile&#13;
staff working with the farmers; involving producers in preparing work programs for their advisers and&#13;
in the evaluation of their performance; facilitating access to extension services, especially to women;&#13;
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system and the accounting and budgetary control systems of&#13;
the implementing bodies. To help broaden the competency of village-level agents, those who are&#13;
proficient in crop production would be trained in animal husbandry and the livestock and forestry&#13;
specialists would be trained in annual crops. The project would provide vehicles and technical&#13;
equipment for staff involved in extension and pay for operating and training costs.&#13;
6 / The component cost includes neither the regular staff paid by the Government nor the small parallel&#13;
operations financed by various donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
4.12 Women-in-agriculture program. The project would particularly contribute to resolving the&#13;
problems that hamper full participation of women in rural development. The measures would include:&#13;
(a) formulating extension messages for crops or activities that are performed predominantly by women;&#13;
(b) developing special modules of advice on processing of food and on simple agroindustrial activities;&#13;
(c) encouraging establishment of female or mixed working groups with a goal of having women make up&#13;
at least one third of the group members; and (d) giving a priority to women in the literacy and numeracy&#13;
programs, which would be organized in collaboration with the Ministry responsible for adult education.&#13;
Women's programs would be incorporated in the unified extension programs which would identify and&#13;
recruit more female staff and finance similar investments as under that program; the literacy and&#13;
numeracy program would provide funds for training of trainers, technical and classroom equipment,&#13;
vehicles, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
4.13    Animal health and pastoralist promotion (US$2.5 million). Besides strengthening the&#13;
capabilities of the general extension service in the dissemination of livestock technology (para 4.10), the&#13;
livestock component would have two subcomponents. The first would strengthen the quality of the&#13;
animal health delivery by further supporting the ongoing privatization process, through training and a&#13;
review of the current animal health legislation. It would also improve the sanitary control capabilities of&#13;
the public service by providing equipment, motorcycles and other vehicles, training, partial salaries and&#13;
operating costs to the key livestock departments (DPIA/DSV) and to the virology, bacteriology,&#13;
parasitology and epidemiology departments and four regional laboratories of LNE. The second would&#13;
develop specialized information services for the transhumant pastoral producers, carrying out a detailed&#13;
stakeholder analysis and developing and equipping more appropriate communication channels (radio,&#13;
markets) for this mobile group. It would further include the establishment of a small advisory unit for&#13;
specialized peri-urban pig and poultry livestock producers. The project would provide training to the&#13;
unit's staff, short-term technical assistance to start the unit, and funds for equipment and operating costs&#13;
for special training courses for commercial pig and poultry farmners.&#13;
4.14   To support these investments, the government would need to agree, at effectiveness, to eliminate&#13;
competition by the public livestock service in "private good tasks" (such as curative treatments, non-&#13;
compulsory vaccinations and sale of pharmaceuticals) by introducing full cost recovery (including&#13;
personnel costs an d transport) for these services during the first project year. These costs would be&#13;
updated every year by the DEP of AGRI-RA. Funds are provided to carry out those updates. As a further&#13;
support to private veterinarians, and to use its own budget most efficiently, the Government would issue,&#13;
before effectiveness, a decree governing the subcontracting ("mandat sanitaire") of public sector tasks,&#13;
such as meat inspection and compulsory vaccination to private veterinarians. It would need to agree to&#13;
introduce cost recovery for the advisory services for commercial producers.&#13;
4.15   Pilot programs (US$4.3 million). Promotion offarmer organizations. On a pilot basis the&#13;
project would help farmer organizations (at regional and local levels, and potentially also at the national&#13;
level) become stronger and prove capable of providing agricultural support services to farmers. These&#13;
services are, in the first instance, expected to be commercial activities such as supplying farm inputs,&#13;
marketing cash crops and organizing rural saving and credit facilities. Also, farmer organizations are&#13;
expected to take part in adaptive research and, once they are sufficiently strong, participate in the transfer&#13;
of agricultural technologies and know-how to their members.&#13;
4.16   Considering the relatively weak development and financial levels of the existing farmer&#13;
organizations, the project would provide assistance to the Directorate for Promoting Cooperatives and&#13;
Rural Legislation (DPCLR) of AGRI-RA to allow it carry out promotional activities more efficiently&#13;
than it has done heretofore. Other support would concentrate directly on making farmer organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
more professional and enabling them to provide services to their members and represent them in various&#13;
forums where their interests are at stake. Thus, assistance under this component would support: (a)&#13;
improvement of the legal and fiscal framework to provide an enabling environment for farmer&#13;
organizations to grow; (b) improvement of the members' capability to develop their professional&#13;
organizations through a literacy and numeracy program and cooperative and group training; (c)&#13;
institution building, by training board members and staff of farmer associations in organization,&#13;
management, economics and accountancy and by providing essential equipment and facilities; (d)&#13;
technical training of permanent professional staff involved in farmer organizations and their promotion,&#13;
including training in participatory technology development and extension; and (e) technology and&#13;
logistical support to grass-roots-level savings and credit associations and their vertical organizations.&#13;
Particular attention would be paid to identifying and supporting women and youth organizations and&#13;
groups, or integrating members of these two groups in other farmer organizations. Wherever possible,&#13;
project activities would be linked with existing organizations active in planning and implementing&#13;
village land management. The project would provide consultancies, training, vehicles, technical and&#13;
office equipment, and assistance to experimental programs that can be used for exhibition and training&#13;
purposes, as well as regional/international study tours for board members and selected staff from farmer&#13;
organizations.&#13;
4.17   Small rural infrastructures. This program finances pilot work on small infrastructures,&#13;
particularly "boulis" and related economic activities, whose establishment would also be based on farmer&#13;
groups. "Boulis" are small, simple-design dams constructed in natural depressions near the villages with&#13;
the help of bulldozers and by doing some compacting and stone/cement strengthening. They provide&#13;
water to the village and its animals until or near the end of the dry season, and are valuable for garden&#13;
plots, brick laying and composting. Village wells and latrines can be added to the bouli-projects to&#13;
ensure the necessary sanitation in regard to water flows. As a social benefit, it has been observed that the&#13;
boulis have helped to reduce migration of the young people who are attracted by the better income that&#13;
the "new occupation" of small-scale irrigation of the vegetable plots can offer. The program financed&#13;
under the project would be a two-year pilot operation, the main purposes of which would be to: (a) study&#13;
and record suitable procedures for developing boulis; (b) study their financial viability and the potential&#13;
benefits and risks; (c) study the potential to make them into a "bankable" scheme; and (d) help prepare a&#13;
larger scheme for the banks and development agencies to finance.&#13;
4.18   Restructuring of agricultural services (US$1.4 million). In line with the policies promoted&#13;
under the Second National Agricultural Adjustment Credit, the project would carry out relevant&#13;
supporting measures to reorganize AGRI-RA activities (para 2.17, 4.4), including possibly setting up a&#13;
temporary unit in charge of restructuring, conduct detailed studies for the reorganization of AGRI-RA&#13;
and CRPAs, provide training and other assistance for redundant staff. For the livestock service, the&#13;
Government would present and implement annual action plans for the separation of the functions of&#13;
control and advice of the livestock front-line staff, and integrating the staff available for extension tasks&#13;
progressively into the unified agricultural extension system. Because the workload of livestock agents in&#13;
the field would continuously change as the privatization of veterinary tasks progresses, action plans&#13;
about the division of labor would be prepared every year for each province. The project would provide&#13;
funds for consultaricies, training, logistics and operating costs.&#13;
&#13;

V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A.    Project Costs&#13;
5.1    The base cost of the project for the 4-year disbursement period is estimated at CFAF 22.5 billion&#13;
(equivalent to US$42.7 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$25.8 million. The total&#13;
foreign exchange component constitutes about 60 percent of project base costs. Physical contingencies&#13;
were calculated on civil works, plant and equipment, training and technical assistance. Price&#13;
contingencies of 4 percent for PY 1 and 3.0 percent for the following years were included for all local&#13;
costs from FY96 onward, reflecting the local inflationary considerations. Price contingencies on foreign&#13;
exchange were 2.3 percent for PY 1 and 2.5 percent for the following three years. Physical contingencies&#13;
amounted to US$1.3 million (3 percent of base costs). Cost estimates are based on first-quarter 1997&#13;
international quotations (UN Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office--IAPSO) for vehicles and&#13;
equipment, machinery and office supplies. Local quotations for the same period covered salaries and&#13;
allowances, civil works and office furniture. A nominal exchange rate of US$1.00 = CFAF526 was used&#13;
for February 1997 in determining project financial costs with depreciation of up to US$1.00 = CFAF536&#13;
during the last year of the four-year investment period. A ten-month lag between project post-appraisal&#13;
and effectiveness was assumed. Given these assumptions, total project cost, including all contingencies,&#13;
was estimated at CFAF 25.1 billion (US$47.3 million) (Annex 1).&#13;

B.    Proposed Financing Plan&#13;
5.2     The credit of US$41.3 million would finance 87.2 percent of total project costs, excluding&#13;
taxes and duties. The credit would have a maturity of 40 years, including a ten-year grace period. It&#13;
would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange, 95 percent of civil works and about 75 percent of other&#13;
local costs. In viewofBurkinaFaso'sdifficultmacroeconomicsituation&gt; the IDA credit would finance all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
capital investments except for 5 percent of civil works, while the Government would finance a part of the&#13;
recurrent expenditures (para 5.6). The Government would finance US$6 million equivalent (12.5 percent&#13;
of total costs), excluding duties and taxes. The beneficiaries under the rural institutions component&#13;
would finance about US$400,000 (20 percent of the direct assistance to farmer organizations under the&#13;
pilot operations). The proposed financing plan for the project is summarized below (the farmer&#13;
organizations' contribution has been incorporated in the Government financing):&#13;

5.3     The components of the project aiming at strengthening the public services amount to&#13;
approximately US$43 million (of which about US$38 million IDA credit). To ensure timely availability&#13;
of counterpart funds, Government contributions to the project agencies would be specified in the&#13;
agencies' annual budgets and would be payable in semi-annual allotments in advance. Because deposits&#13;
would be due in advance, the initial deposit in each account would be required to cover three months of&#13;
operations for the particular component before the project could become effective. Failure to adhere to the&#13;
semi-annual deposit schedule would be treated as a cause for suspension of the disbursements by IDA.&#13;
Assurances regarding all these requirements were obtained in the course of project negotiations.&#13;
C. Procurementand Disbursements&#13;
5.4   Procurement. All the project units involved in implementation include staff experienced with the&#13;
Bank procurement procedures. Project procurement would conform with Bank guidelines (January 1995,&#13;
modified in August 1996) within the following thresholds: (a) all civil works, except small renovation works,&#13;
would be procured through national competitive bidding procedures (NCB). Contracts under the pilot&#13;
component, with estimated costs of less than US$30,000 equivalent, would be let out by using the&#13;
"community-participation" method, following procedures stated in the Implementation Manual and acceptable&#13;
to IDA, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million equivalent; (b) goods would be procured in&#13;
accordance with international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures except for: (i) goods estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$200,000 equivalent per contract which will be procured through NCB procedures; and (ii) goods&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, in an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2&#13;
million equivalent, to be procured by local shopping based on at least three quotations. The implementation&#13;
units would be requested to prepare a computer-based system to monitor that the aggregate amounts agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
upon will not be exceeded. Goods manufactured in Burkina Faso will be granted a margin of preference in&#13;
ICR contracts in accordance with the World Bank guidelines. Contracts for goods would, to the extent&#13;
practicable, be grouped into packages of US$200,000 equivalent or more. For consultants, the Bank's&#13;
consultant guidelines of January 1997 would be followed. All bidding and contract documents for civil works,&#13;
goods and equipment and consultant firms exceeding US$50,000 (US$20,000 for individual consultants) would&#13;
be subject to prior review by IDA. The Borrower presented to IDA a draft procurement schedule for the&#13;
entire project period at negotiations. The procurement arrangements are further detailed in Annex III.&#13;
5.5    Disbursementof IDA Credit Disbursementarrangementsare explained in detail in Annex III.&#13;
They will be complemented by a DisbursementLetter by the World Bank's DisbursementDivision&#13;
(LOAAF) once the project has been approved.&#13;
5.6    To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, the&#13;
Governmentwould open Special Accounts for AGRI-RA, INERA and IRSAT in CFAF in a local&#13;
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations would amount to&#13;
CFAF 600 million for AGRI-RA, CFAF 400 million for INERA and CFAF 100 million for IRSAT, and&#13;
would cover about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, CFAF 300 million for AGRI-&#13;
RA, CFAF 200 million for INERA and CFAF 50 million for IRSAT will be deposited in the respective&#13;
Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the&#13;
Credit account and/or Special commitments issued amount to one half of allocated funds for each entity.&#13;
The disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be authorized once the institute has implemented accounting&#13;
and financial management systems similar to INERA (para 5.7). The Special Accounts would be used for&#13;
all payments inferior to 20 percent of the initial deposits. Replenishmentapplications would be submitted&#13;
monthly. All replenishmentapplications should be fully documented except for contracts of less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for civil works, goods and equipment, consultant firms (US$20,000 for individual&#13;
consultants), training, studies and operating costs, which would be claimed on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained at the project&#13;
implementation units for review by the IDA supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
E. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
5.7   The implementing agencies, except IRSAT, have participated in IDA-financed projects in the&#13;
past and have adequate accounting systems. INERA is putting in place, with the support of an&#13;
international accounting firm, an improved financial management system, including cost accounting (by&#13;
programs, research centers and stations and source of funding). A system similar to that introduced in&#13;
INERA would be installed at IRSAT. Funding required for the recruitment of the financial and&#13;
accounting firm for IRSAT would be available after Board approval, while other disbursement of project&#13;
funds for IRSAT would be authorized once the financial management system is in place and the manual&#13;
of accounting procedures has been adopted by the CNRST Board. All agencies would maintain their&#13;
accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect their operations and financial&#13;
positions. They would have the accounts including Special Accounts and SOEs, audited by a firm of&#13;
independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
audited accounts and the auditors' report, including the Management Letter (long form), and a statement&#13;
as to whether or not Bank funds had been used for their intended purpose, would be submitted to IDA&#13;
within six months of the end of the fiscal year of each agency.&#13;
5.8    By September 30 of each year starting with 1997, the implementing agencies would submit to&#13;
their respective ministries, with a copy to the IDA, their annual work programs and budgets for the&#13;
following year. The report format would adequately portray project activities, unit costs, benefits and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
productivity and would provide the basis for proper management of the project and operation of a sound&#13;
project accounting system. The budget proposal would include quarterly cash flow statements.&#13;
Procurement plan for goods and civil works would specify source of funds, timing, and procurement&#13;
methods (whether ICB or other), and would be accompanied by an updated Procurement Schedule for the&#13;
remaining life of the project. After having been reviewed and approved by the supervising ministries,&#13;
the agency budgets would be reviewed by the Steering Committee (para 6.1). The supervising ministries&#13;
would then submit the budgets to the Ministry of Finance to agree on the level of annual funding,&#13;
financial plan, and allocation of resources. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, by November&#13;
30 of each year starting from 1996, the supervising ministries would submit to the Bank for comments a&#13;
copy of the NASDP II program and budget for the coming year.&#13;
5.9   Each participating agency would submit semiannual reports and management accounts to the&#13;
supervising ministry, copied to the Steering Committee and IDA, showing actual and budgeted&#13;
expenditures, statements of progress achieved and the objectives for the forthcoming quarter by each&#13;
project component. Semiannual reports would contain summaries of expenditures to date and use of&#13;
funds by source, plus a forecast of withdrawal of IDA credit proceeds by quarter for the immediate&#13;
forthcoming year and by year thereafter.&#13;
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Overall Organization and Management&#13;
6.1   The general oversight of implementationwould be the responsibilityof an interministerial&#13;
committee (Steering Committee for the Agricultural Services Project). It would be chaired by the Secretary&#13;
Generals of AGRI-RA and MESSRS on behalf of the respective Ministers. The chairmanship would&#13;
alternate annually. The committee would consist of 15 persons, representingthe ministries, regional bodies&#13;
and research institutes most concerned in project operations (the list of members and the functions of the&#13;
Committee are given in Annex VII of the Project ImplementationManual). The Committee would assign&#13;
senior staffto take part in the wrap-up meetings of the IDA supervisionmissions. The Steering Committee&#13;
would meet, as a minimum, once every six months. In addition to reviewing policy, financial and&#13;
coordination issues, the Committee would approve the annual budgets and work plans and receive&#13;
information about the appointment of principal staff needed for project implementation (appointment of&#13;
the staff would be the responsibility of the respective ministries). The Committee would also ensure,&#13;
through the respective Ministries, that adequate counterpart funds would be made available for project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
6.2     Under the supervision of MESSRS and AGRI-RA, a separate body would be responsible for&#13;
coordination of each project component: the Directorate General of CNRST for the research component and&#13;
the Project CoordinationUnit for AGRI-RA Services (CU). The DirectorGeneral is already responsible for&#13;
coordinating, supervising, monitoring and evaluation of the scientific activities in the Ministry. He would&#13;
handle the same responsibilitiesfor the project. The National Coordinatorheading the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit at AGRI-RA would be responsible for promoting coordinated actions under the AGRI-RA component,&#13;
supervising financial management and procurement, and monitoring implementation of the plans for action.&#13;
He would have three subunits to assist him: Finance and Procurement, Internal Audits and Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation. The respective Directorates of AGRI-RA would implement the AGRI-RA components. INERA&#13;
and IRSAT, with their Secretary Generals in charge, would execute the research component of the project&#13;
with adequate independence and authorization in using project funds and carrying out procurement under the&#13;
project. The organization of project coordination and management is depicted in Chart I of Annex IV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
B. Operations of the Different Components&#13;
6.3    Agricultural Research. 7 INERA and IRSAT would operate under the general guidance of&#13;
CRNST Board of Governors. To review the research programs that the institutes prepare within the&#13;
framework of the National Agricultural Research Strategy, the Board would rely on a Scientific and&#13;
Technical Commission (STC), consisting of 10 to 15 members nominated from renowned national or&#13;
foreign scientists.&#13;
6.4   STC and the Directorate of CNRST have an important role in the review and approval process, as&#13;
well as in the monitoring and evaluation of research. Their role would be made explicit in the procedure&#13;
manual of CNRST prepard before preparation. The CRNST Board would need to adopt this manual, as&#13;
well as a manual for INERA and IRSAT organizations, before the project can become effective.&#13;
6.5    Organization of research andprogram content. The new INERA, which combines the previous&#13;
INERA and IRBET, would be organized into five regional research centers--Saria, Farakoba, Di-Tougan,&#13;
Kouare, Dori-Katchari--corresponding to the five major agroecological zones, and one national center,&#13;
Kamboinse. The national center would house all the major laboratories and would carry out the basic&#13;
research activities under the direction of the department heads. The basic research carried out at&#13;
Kamboinse would support the applied and adaptive research performed by the regional research centers.&#13;
The Kamboinse station would also be responsible for organizing all training for scientists and other staff.&#13;
Each regional center would have a multidisciplinary natural resource management and production systems&#13;
team in charge of on-farm testing and adaptation as well as a participatory technology development unit to&#13;
collaborate with producer organizations and extension services.&#13;
6.6   Program planning and review process. INERA is putting in place a program planning and review&#13;
process to ensure that research meets the country's needs and is adequate. First, at the level of the&#13;
regional centers, researchers review their research results and program the activities of the following year&#13;
with a small group of producers and with regional extension and NGO staff--i.e., the users with whom&#13;
they usually work on on-farm testing and adaptation. Every other year, each regional center would hold a&#13;
large meeting (the Regional Technical Committee) with research clients (producer groups, extension and&#13;
development staff and NGOs) to present research results, propose future activities in accordance with the&#13;
consultation with the working groups, and obtain agreement on research priorities for the next two years.&#13;
This process is intended to ensure that producers participate in the process, so that the research will meet&#13;
their needs. The regional research activities are then aggregated, consolidated and reviewed at the&#13;
program (national) level. They are reviewed by a Program Commission, an external body, which can also&#13;
propose activities and provide feedback. The agreed work programs and budgets are then presented to&#13;
INERA's Scientific and Management Council. This advisory body makes recommendations to the&#13;
CRNST Board of Governors through the Scientific and Technical Council regarding the funding the&#13;
Institute's proposed work program. During the project period, the annual research programs would be&#13;
communicated to IDA for prior review before being presented to INERA's Scientific and Management&#13;
Council.&#13;
6.7   Partnership with producer organizations. Participatory research methods are necessary for&#13;
fostering client-oriented research. Equally important is the influence that the producers can exert on the&#13;
research agenda, not only for the design of on-farm experiments but also at the on-station stage. In&#13;
/ See also Annexes 1.1 and I. 2 in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
addition to the programming and review process described above, INERA and IRSAT would develop&#13;
contractual arrangements with a few producer organizations to develop technologies of interest to these&#13;
organizations. These partnerships would be established gradually on a pilot basis as it takes time to make&#13;
them permanent (during the past three years, three such partnerships have already been established).&#13;
6.8    National and regional collaboration. A number of scientists outside CNRST are affiliated with&#13;
the university, special schools such as the Rural Development Institute (IDR), units of other ministries&#13;
such as the National Livestock Laboratory, or with NGOs. A line item in the budget, managed by the&#13;
Director General of CNRST, would enable CNRST to contract these scientists to collaborate with INERA&#13;
and IRSAT scientists (i.e., from institutes in the North or from the regions, or with international research&#13;
centers) in implementing the strategic plan and thereby optimizing the use of scarce country resources.&#13;
The project also intends to support INERA and IRSAT to adapt and implement the principles of the&#13;
Framework for Action of the Special Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR). The project&#13;
would also promote the scientists' participation in regional and international research programs and&#13;
networks.&#13;
6.9   Physical infrastructure and equipment. There would be only limited development of&#13;
infrastructure under the project, mainly completing structures in progress and rehabilitating other&#13;
facilities. Before architectural and engineering plans are prepared, INERA and IRSAT would prepare&#13;
experiment station development plans to indicate the future use of buildings and grounds. A commission&#13;
composed of senior scientists and engineers would oversee the development of such plans and monitor&#13;
their implementation. Once INERA and IRSAT have prepared an experimental station development plan&#13;
acceptable to IDA, disbursement for civil works and land improvement would be made under the IDA&#13;
credit for that particular location. Disbursement for equipment would depend on the presentation of an&#13;
agricultural equipment profile for the research stations and the results of a laboratory study based on an&#13;
analysis of the gap between the existing equipment and the equipment needed to carry out the activities&#13;
projected under the Strategic Plan.&#13;
6.10   Human resources management. Burkinabe research institutes are part of the African and&#13;
Malagasy Council for Higher Education System (CAMES) for researchers' promotion. Proposals to&#13;
revise the CAMES promotion system for researchers to make it more responsive to the needs of clients,&#13;
rather than being academically-oriented, would be made to the CAMES Council of Ministers. Whatever&#13;
the outcome of the negotiations between the MESSRS and the CAMES, the MESSRS would need to&#13;
adopt a system of promotion for the researchers with criteria that would encourage development-oriented&#13;
research. Agreement to adopt such a system not later than December 31, 1998, was agreed upon at credit&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
6.11   The decree for establishment of CRNST and its institutes IRSAT and INERA (reglement&#13;
d'etablissement) has been developed to include a description of conditions of entry for each category of&#13;
staff and researcher. It also contains a system for ongoing evaluation of staff performance, including an&#13;
incentive and reward system. Agreement that a performance review system, including incentives and&#13;
rewards, would be adopted by the CNRST Board before December 31, 1998, was agreed upon at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
6.12   Agricultural extension and other AGRI-RA components. Under the restructured AGRI-RA,&#13;
agricultural extension and related activities will be carried out through a "unified extension system,"&#13;
which provides a single line of command with five vertical levels. They are: (a) the local level, with&#13;
about 1,000 village extension workers (CAPs), each serving about 800 households in 4 to 8 villages; (b)&#13;
the zonal level, with 150 supervisors, each working with 8 to 10 CAPs; (c) the provincial level, with 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
teams of managers and specialists supervising and providing support to the zonal and village levels; in&#13;
each province, there are also 4 to 6 Subject Matter Specialists (Technical Specialists--TS), carrying out&#13;
adaptive research, training the CAPs in fortnightly workshops and serving as liaison among farmers,&#13;
CAPs and researchers; (d) the regional level consisting of 12 DRARAs, which, besides supervising and&#13;
supporting the layers below them, are in charge of evaluating and processing the data collected by&#13;
surveyors posted in the provinces; they also carry out adaptive research at PAPEMs and organize training&#13;
of the Technical Specialists during monthly workshops, getting expert assistance from researchers and&#13;
other resource persons; and (e) the central level. As the extension staff age structure indicates a need to&#13;
make preparations for replacements in the near future, the Government has establish a thorough record&#13;
and projections of the extension staff and a policy for replacing the aging or otherwise revising staff.&#13;
6.13   At the central level, the Directorate of Agricultural Extension (DVA) will continue to have sole&#13;
responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the day-to-day operations of extension activities that deal&#13;
with crops, animal production, natural resource management and gender-specific activities. The DVA&#13;
will also have overall responsibility for the training of extension staff, including producing and using&#13;
audio-visual materials; monitoring and evaluation; adaptive research; and maintenance of linkages with&#13;
the research institutes. The Director of DVA is assisted by a team of technical managers for training and&#13;
extension, monitoring and evaluation, adaptive research and women's activities. The Chief of&#13;
Administration and Finance in DVA is responsible for the delivery of timely and adequate resources and&#13;
facilities to the entire extension system and for monitoring their efficient use.&#13;
6.14   For extension to be effective, the advisory messages must be tailored to farmers' needs. Hence, it&#13;
is important that DVA solicit and obtain the participation of the various stakeholders, including the&#13;
relevant farmer organizations and NGOs. Specialized organizations responsible for processing, marketing&#13;
and exporting commodities, such as SOFITEX for cotton and UCOBAM for vegetables, could contribute&#13;
to the content of extension messages by providing information about their concerns and perhaps by&#13;
providing resource persons for the training of Technical Specialists. To strengthen the linkages with the&#13;
research institutes, Technical Specialists would attend monthly workshops and refresher courses in&#13;
adaptive research and training during the dry season. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DVA&#13;
would enter into agreements with SOFITEX , INERA and IRSAT, respectively. These accords would&#13;
relate to each agency's contribution to the content of extension messages concerning agricultural&#13;
technology, training of the Technical Specialists and financial arrangements to carry out this cooperation.&#13;
6.15   Regarding livestock extension, the current extension tools (communal demonstration herds, test&#13;
herds, demonstration plots, etc.) would be adapted to include use of individually managed entire herds in&#13;
demonstrations and tests; greater reliance on producer-led experimentation, information exchange and&#13;
producer cross-visits; and greater reliance on mass media. The project would develop, under the&#13;
respective responsibility of DPIA, a special information service for transhumant producers and encourage&#13;
them to share information on pasture, water and animal health conditions along transhumance routes,&#13;
marketing, land-tenure issues and other organizational aspects, and a specialized service for commercial&#13;
pig and poultry producers.&#13;
6.16     Women in Agriculture Program (WIA). 8 The WIA program would promote agricultural&#13;
activities that are either solely or largely carried out by women; these include crop production, livestock,&#13;
food processing techniques, and utilization, storage and marketing of farm products and other off-farm&#13;
income-generating activities. Appropriate technologies would be generated and developed through the&#13;
/ See also Annex 1.3 in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
agricultural research programs of INERA and IRSAT and through adaptive research at PAPEMs. A&#13;
specialist at the national level in AGRI-RA, regional specialists at CRPAs and Technical Specialists at the&#13;
provincial level--all integrated into the unified extension system--would implement on-farm and other&#13;
extension activities and train the CAPs, including males, and their supervisors in zones. The female TSs&#13;
would operate like the other technical specialists, but only in agricultural technologies that are solely or&#13;
largely performed by women.&#13;
6.17    Other measures to be adopted would include increasing the number of qualified female staff at&#13;
all levels (zonal, provincial, regional and headquarters) and accelerating efforts to reach more female&#13;
members of the contact farm families and other female farmers with appropriate technologies. One third&#13;
of the contact groups would be female. The increase in the number of female staff would be attained by&#13;
identifying more female CAPs to address women in groups. The CAPs would make other production&#13;
recommendations to the women as members of the contact families in their respective circles. In the&#13;
provinces where there is strong inhibition against male extension workers interacting directly with women&#13;
farmers, female CAPs would disseminate appropriate technologies to women farmers and select some of&#13;
them as contact farmers. The proposed increase in the number of female extension workers at the head&#13;
office, regions, provinces and zones would improve the coverage of women working in agriculture. The&#13;
mass media would be used extensively in the work with women groups. Female CAPs would be&#13;
expected to spend up to 70 percent of their time disseminating technologies on agricultural production and&#13;
about 30 percent supporting the processing and use of agricultural produce.&#13;
6.18   Livestock health and pastoralist promotion. 9 The livestock component would be implemented&#13;
under the general coordination of the Directorate of Production and Animal Industries (DPIA), which&#13;
would delegate responsibility for the extension subcomponent to the Directorate of Agricultural Extension&#13;
(DVA), the pastoral component to the Division of Pastoral Areas Promotion (SAEP) and the animal health&#13;
component to the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DSV). The National Livestock Laboratory (LNE)&#13;
would be responsible for implementing of the laboratory component in close collaboration with INERA.&#13;
To enable fast and direct disease-reporting links between the regional and national laboratories, the&#13;
Government would transfer responsibility for the regional laboratories from DRARA to LNE before&#13;
effectiveness. Furthermore, a study would be needed to assess the feasibility of transforming LNE into an&#13;
independent administrative entity (EPA). This study would be carried out, and its results implemented, in&#13;
the first project year. Specialized training activities could be subcontracted to other government&#13;
organizations, regional agencies, or NGOs. Dissemination of pastoral information should be closely&#13;
coordinated with other donors projects working in the same field.&#13;
6.19   To effectively implement the subcomponent for private animal health and advisory services, the&#13;
Government would, as would be agreed upon at negotiation, provide equal opportunities to private&#13;
veterinarians and eliminate competition of the livestock service in the "private goods tasks" such as&#13;
curative treatments, noncompulsory vaccinations and sale of pharmaceuticals by phasing out all these&#13;
services in the areas where a private veterinarian is established and by introducing full cost recovery&#13;
(including personnel costs and transport) for all "private goods tasks." Furthermore, the Government&#13;
would issue, before effectiveness, a decree governing the subcontracting (mandat sanitaire) of public&#13;
sector tasks such as compulsory vaccinations and meat inspection to private practitioners, and introduce&#13;
advisory services to private specialized producers under a partial and progressively increasing cost&#13;
recovery system.&#13;
/ See also Annex 1.4 in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
6.20   Rural Institutions. The agencies most involved with the rural institutions component would be&#13;
the Directorate of Cooperatives and Rural Legislation (DPCLR), Project Coordination Unit and the&#13;
National and Regional Advisory Committees for farmer organizations. A portion of the component funds&#13;
are allocated to DPCLR, which would implement it independently after presenting its annual work plans&#13;
for discussion to the National Advisory Committee (CCN). Besides monitoring the activities and output,&#13;
CU would, where necessary, assist in all activities, such as procurement and disbursement of project funds&#13;
for the expenses of DPCLR. 10&#13;
6.21   Direct assistance for rural institutions would be elaborated on the basis of the studies and plans&#13;
under way for the rural credit operations (financed by Swiss and European Union assistance) or prepared&#13;
under the PASA II program for the professionalization of farmer organizations. It would be followed by a&#13;
national conference to be organized by DPCLR, representative farmer organizations, IDA and other&#13;
donors. Based on the overall approach to be recommended by the conference planned for early 1997,&#13;
annual plans and assistance programs would be prepared by a subcommittee comprising members of CCN&#13;
and staff of DPCM and CU. The endorsement of the CCN and no-objection by IDA would be needed&#13;
before project funds are available for each annual program. One of the objectives is to have by the second&#13;
half of the project a national-level federation of cooperatives would operate the assistance program&#13;
outlined above.&#13;
6.22   Farmer organizations would receive grants (against 20 percent own financing) to help implement&#13;
small subprojects formulated with the help of the DPCLR's field staff or NGOs. These subprojects would&#13;
be approved by the Regional Advisory Committees (CCR). Because the component is a pilot operation,&#13;
funds would be insufficient to cover all the needs in the sector, and the CCN would have to use selection&#13;
criteria for choosing 5 to 6 provinces for the program, as well as the organizations and activities to be&#13;
aided each year. The selection procedure and criteria were agreed upon at negotiations; the criteria would&#13;
include a potential replication effect after the pilot phase, suitable size and degree of certainty that the&#13;
project objectives can be achieved with the funds available, regional spread, contribution by the members&#13;
at 20 percent minimum, availability of competent staff or adequate training facilities, and level of&#13;
coverage (number of people involved). Whenever possible, the actual implementation of the subprojects&#13;
would be contracted out by the OP to a suitable agency or consultants. A typical example of such&#13;
contracting would be the literacy courses that would be best implemented by specialized NGOs (6.29).&#13;
The Government has prepared the operational manuals explaining the details of these operations.&#13;
6.23   Restructuring of AGRI-RA. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources has approved&#13;
a restructuring plan that has been drafted by a specialist team of FAO and thoroughly reviewed and&#13;
partially revised by a Steering Committee at AGRI-RA (paras 2.17, 4.4). The restructuring program&#13;
would be implemented under direct supervision of the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources.&#13;
However, a special coordination unit set up for planning the Second SECAL would carry out the day-to-&#13;
day monitoring of the restructuring program. The Steering Committee which oversees this unit is&#13;
chaired by the Secretary General of AGRI-RA. Implementation of the actions required under this&#13;
component will be initiated under the Second National Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit, and,&#13;
consequently, supervision of the implementation of the component will be done in collaboration with&#13;
ASAC. During post-appraisal, the Government agreed that it will: (a) complete the establishment of the&#13;
organs and management procedures under the restructuring program of AGRI-RA; (b) give termination&#13;
/ See also Annex A.4 in the Implementation Manual. The French Ministry of Cooperation is&#13;
considering the possibility of offering a Farner Organizations Specialists to AGRI-RA to help,&#13;
among other things, in the activities assisted by this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
notice to the 600 contractual staff to be released; and (c) identify the ex-CRPA staff who can be&#13;
effectively used in the new DRARAs and make a decision on their transfer. At negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that the Government: (a) carry out redeployment of personnel and organizing the related&#13;
transfers as per the reorganization plan before June 30, 1998. (These arrangements would need to&#13;
include separation of the control and advice functions at the level of field agents and unification of the&#13;
available livestock personnel into the national extension system, based on annual action plans for each&#13;
province); and (b) prepare with the help of an audit firm a financial audit of the assets and liabilities of&#13;
the CRPAs not later than April 30, 1998; and (c) liquidate the liabilities not later than April 30, 1999.&#13;
C. Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
6.25   The units and systems needed for planning, monitoring and evaluation have been developed and&#13;
instituted during the predecessor projects on agricultural extension and research. These units and systems&#13;
would be strengthened during the NASDP II. Detailed work programs would be prepared annually for&#13;
each unit benefiting from project funds. These plans would include detailed data and information on the&#13;
inputs needed and outputs expected. For the AGRI-RA activities, monitoring of the implementation of&#13;
the work programs would be based on reports collected and data processed in the channel of zonal,&#13;
provincial and DRARA units. The DRARAs would have separate Monitoring and Evaluation Units for&#13;
this purpose. At the national level, the M&amp;E unit would be located in the Project Coordination Unit. On&#13;
the side of agricultural research, information and data would flow from the field and regional research&#13;
stations to INERA and IRSAT where they would be processed for the monitoring and evaluation reports.&#13;
A lot of data is already being collected, but they are not always processed adequately to be of benefit for&#13;
project or ministerial management.&#13;
6.26   For one part, monitoring would focus on assessing the physical implementation of the investments&#13;
proposed under the project. For extension (including livestock and gender-specific extension), the key&#13;
indicators would include adherence to training and visit schedules, attendance to fortnightly&#13;
demonstration sessions (data to be divided by gender), and the number of demonstration plots or herds.&#13;
For research, the monitoring system would report, on physical implementation of the respective activities,&#13;
as well as on the advancement in each of the research programs. Evaluation of the project impact would&#13;
aim at analyzing the meeting of project development objectives. These would be measured by such&#13;
indicators as adoption rates and differences in yields and production in with- and without-the-project&#13;
situations. As the Agricultural Statistics Directorate is responsible for annual production estimates, and as&#13;
yields and production are affected by numerous factors and different agencies, collaboration will need to&#13;
be arranged between these agencies and the evaluation units in AGRI-RA, CRNST and the research&#13;
institutes to establish the base-line situation and to collect the essential follow-up data and information in&#13;
a systematic manner. It is envisaged that consultant assistance would be needed to do all this.&#13;
Additionally, independent consultants would be needed to carry out the evaluation studies every two to&#13;
three years. The indicators for monitoring project performance and measuring the project impact were&#13;
agreed upon at negotiations. Consultants would be recruited to help establish a coordinated monitoring&#13;
system and carry out independent impact evaluations.&#13;
D. Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
6.27    Training. All the components of the project would contain training elements. The project&#13;
would put in place an in-service training program to reflect emerging changes and needs in technology&#13;
and policy areas. The highest priority for training would be strengthening the management and technical&#13;
capacity of staff at all levels through in-house and external (including some overseas) courses. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
training program for eligible AGRI-RA staff would be coordinated by the Directorate of Extension (DVA)&#13;
I Iand for INERA and IRSAT staff by CRNST. In consultation with each operational unit, these agencies&#13;
would be responsible for: (a) managing in-house training activities; (b) establishing procedures and&#13;
criteria for determining staff training needs; (c) preparing criteria for selecting training programs and&#13;
candidates; (d) developing procedures for evaluating training activities; (e) identifying suitable training&#13;
institutions for external in-country and external courses; and (f) organizing a record keeping system for&#13;
trainees. The T&amp;V training for extension staff would be planned and executed by DVA, while training for&#13;
other AGRI-RA staff would require inputs from other Directorates in the Ministry for planning and&#13;
implementing the training program. National institutions would be used to conduct in-country extension&#13;
training programs. A prime goal in training policy would be cost-effectiveness; for example, AGRI-RA&#13;
and CRNST would try to find suitable locations for training in Burkina Faso, and only if such locations&#13;
were unavailable in the country, would they look for outside opportunities, first elsewhere in Africa, then&#13;
in other developing countries, and only then, in developed countries. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that the Human Resource Development Plans would be based on skill-gap analyses and&#13;
updated annually, and that the annual training program for each participating agency would be submitted&#13;
to the Bank for agreement before implementation.&#13;
6.28   Technical assistance. No long-term technical assistance is proposed under the project.&#13;
Government agencies in the past have faced, however, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequately&#13;
experienced and qualified specialists, such as financial controllers and monitoring and evaluation experts&#13;
because of higher salaries in the private sector and shortage of qualified applicants. The local expertise&#13;
needed but not available in the Government service, would be obtained through contractual arrangements&#13;
with Burkinabe consultant firms or individual specialists; expatriate recruitment would take place only if&#13;
the required expertise is unavailable locally. In view of the highly specialized needs of the agricultural&#13;
research and some other activities, such as station management and monitoring and evaluation, where&#13;
professional skills as well as continuity are very important, institutions with appropriate expertise would&#13;
be identified to provide short-term consultants. In addition, short-term consultants for specific studies,&#13;
notably to support agricultural research, extension, human resource development and farmer organization&#13;
activities, would be hired as needed. The project agencies are expected to enter into contractual&#13;
arrangements at terms and conditions, and with the terms of reference and qualifications agreeable to the&#13;
Bank with selected institutions or individuals to support project activities.&#13;
6.29    Literacy program and group training. The project would provide several activities to address&#13;
the functional literacy needs of the officers in farmer organizations and more generally of women farmers,&#13;
whose educational levels are low and who therefore have limitations in managing economic activities.&#13;
First, functional literacy training provided under PRSAP I would continue under NASDP II with an&#13;
emphasis on female participation. Second, group-skill trainers would be appointed at provincial level to&#13;
provide training in two main subjects: the management of groups and group activities for group leaders,&#13;
and transformation and agroprocessing technologies for group members. Third, regional specialists in&#13;
gender issues would serve as a clearinghouse in their areas to put people who have received such training&#13;
in touch with NGOs and other projects and agencies that can provide the credit so that maximum&#13;
advantage can be taken of the training.&#13;
/ If needed, with assistance from the Directorate for Professional Training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
E.    Mid-Term and Completion Reviews&#13;
6.30    Midterm reviews. The Coordination Unit (CU), with inputs from the benefiting Directorates&#13;
of AGRI-RA, would prepare a progress report on the AGRI-RA components of the project before&#13;
midterm. Similarly, INERA and IRSAT, with coordination from CNRST, would prepare progress&#13;
reports. In addition, the Coordinating Unit of PASA would prepare a report on the implementation of the&#13;
restructuring of AGRI-RA. These reports would form the basis for the mid-term review to be undertaken&#13;
jointly by the Government and IDA at the end of Project year 2. To facilitate meaningful monitoring,&#13;
implementation and impact indicators for all components were agreed upon at negotiations. The review&#13;
of the AGRI-RA components would focus on assessing the success of the technology support system in&#13;
adapting and disseminating new messages on crops and livestock to farmers to improve total farm&#13;
productivity and in promoting sustainable use of land and water resources. Progress in strengthening of&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities in AGRI-RA and results in the program of strengthening and&#13;
expanding the farmer organizations would also be assessed. Implementation of the research component&#13;
would be reviewed against agreed objectives, particularly the capability of the research system to&#13;
develop appropriate technology messages and liaise with other agencies for disseminating them to the&#13;
farming community. Also, the operational procedures set in place at INERA and IRSAT would be&#13;
reviewed. At negotiation, assurances were obtained that CU and CNRST would coordinate preparation&#13;
of comprehensive progress reports and each benefiting agency would prepare their own reports for the&#13;
midterm review of the project which would be completed no later than three months after the mid-term&#13;
by a joint Government/World Bank team.&#13;
6.31    Implementation Completion Report. An ICR would be prepared under the coordination of&#13;
the Project Steering Committee, with contributions from the participating agencies. It would assess&#13;
achievements of the project in relation to its objectives; field impact of the new approach to liaisons&#13;
between the agencies involved; and achievement of a consolidated level of operations by the agencies&#13;
benefiting from the project. The ICR would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after&#13;
completion of the project.&#13;
F.    Implementation Schedules&#13;
6.32    During the first year of the project, emphasis in the AGRI-RA components would concentrate&#13;
on strengthening the unification of extension services, particularly through improved linking of the&#13;
livestock operations and improving quality of the on-farm adaptive research (OFAR) and extension&#13;
programs. On the research side, the new administrative and organizational arrangements would take&#13;
place (including establishment of IRSAT), together with firming up the programs in line with the new&#13;
strategy of agricultural research. Limited civil works and rehabilitation, and procurement of most of the&#13;
vehicles, field and laboratory equipment would be carried out during the first two years of the project.&#13;
Applications for financing under the farmer organization component would be invited, and the first ones&#13;
would probably be appraised before effectiveness of the Credit. A bar chart showing the implementation&#13;
schedule for key activities is given in Annex II. Bank supervision mission timing and nature is provided&#13;
in the same schedule. The first Bank supervision mission will cover three representative regions and&#13;
would confirm with the CU, INERA and IRSAT the practicability of a list of performance indicators&#13;
prepared under NASDP II to assess the development impact and the institutional effectiveness of the&#13;
project entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
7.1   In Burkina Faso, determination of project benefits resulting from an agricultural services project&#13;
must include agricultural and livestock activities performed by smallholders, who represent more than 90&#13;
percent of the farmers. In the analysis prepared for this project, the agricultural component included an&#13;
estimation of farm budgets by agroecological zones and standard types of farms, and an assessment of&#13;
overall benefits by aggregating farm budgets, according to assumptions made by the mission on&#13;
prospective adoption rates. The livestock component included an estimation of herd and flock budgets&#13;
by standard type and an assessment of overall benefits by aggregating herd budgets, according to&#13;
assumptions made by the mission on the prospective adoption rates by cattle and sheep breeders.&#13;
A. Farm-level Analysis&#13;
7.2    Farm/herd models. Primary project beneficiaries would be small farmers currently practicing&#13;
low-input, low-output technologies in farming systems. Because cropping systems vary considerably&#13;
within the four selected agroecological zones, it was assumed that main project benefits would accrue&#13;
from incremental production resulting from adoption of the improved varieties and associated cultural&#13;
practices by farmers, along with better livestock health, breeding, feeding and management. To analyze&#13;
the financial and economic benefits, six different farm models were prepared, one for each agroclimatic&#13;
zone and two more general models. For livestock, four typical models were used in the analysis (Annex&#13;
4, Appendices A and B).&#13;
7.3    Determination of benefits and costs. A matrix in Annex 4, Appendix A, indicates, by type of&#13;
farm, the technical packages and levels of productivity that were used to assess benefits from target&#13;
farms and to estimate impact in each agroecological zone. The yield increases were projected to vary&#13;
from 14 percent to 41 percent (depending on the region and the crop), and to be achieved over four years&#13;
only by the adopting farmers. Three types of cattle herds and one type of flock of sheep have been used&#13;
for the economic model. The first corresponds to a transhumant cattle herd of 45 heads located in the&#13;
Sahel. The two other types correspond to relatively sedentary cattle herds located throughout Burkina&#13;
Faso, which are integrated with cropping activities through the use of ox-drawn cultivation and organic&#13;
manure.&#13;
7.4   Inputs and financial prices. For cropping activities, the major inputs used in production are&#13;
labor, fertilizer, farm chemicals and improved seeds. Labor, the single most important component of&#13;
crop production costs in Burkina Faso, accounts for about 60 to 80 percent of total input costs. Fertilizer&#13;
use in Burkina Faso is extremely low at 7.5 kg/ha. Prices for these inputs are set by the government&#13;
(subsidies were suppressed in 1996, along with an important increase in the farmgate price of cotton).&#13;
Other inputs of increasing importance in food crop production are improved seeds and agrochemicals for&#13;
seed treatment.&#13;
7.5    Output markets and financial prices. The major constraints to efficient marketing of&#13;
agricultural outputs are a poor distribution network, which leads to wide disparity between farmgate and&#13;
retail market prices and seasonal price fluctuations; inadequate low-cost storage at the farm level; and&#13;
inadequate processing capacity at the village level. The project includes research and extension activities&#13;
to alleviate a part of these constraints, in particular through farmer organizations. As demand for&#13;
domestically produced crops is high, the above project activities would facilitate the market absorption&#13;
of the increased production to be generated under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
7.6    Farm and Herd Financial Budgets. For the agricultural component, the farm-level returns&#13;
were estimated on the basis of "with project" and "without project" situations. Six models were&#13;
reviewed in the crop production situations and four for the livestock component. All farm budgets&#13;
showed a significant increase of returns to farm family; a major part of this increase can be attributed to&#13;
project interventions (Annex 4, Appendix A). The benefit/cost ratios (B:C ratios) for the different crop&#13;
budgets with the project varied from to 1.06 to 1.95, as against the B:C ratios without the project of 0.92&#13;
to 1.91. The ratios were calculated after allowing the present farm salaries to be paid for the family labor&#13;
in the without-project situation, and increased salaries for the with-the-project situation. The best B:C&#13;
ratio would be possible to reach by cultivating valley-bottom rice (anywhere in the country), followed by&#13;
the farm model using oxen power in the West. The weakest ratio would be reached in the Sahel area&#13;
with or without the project, the former being, however, higher.&#13;
7.7    Moreover, the budgets that were calculated for herds showed significant increases in returns to&#13;
breeders, mainly because of project interventions (Annex 4, Appendix B). For instance, in the year 10&#13;
after the project start, the herds of the adopting owners would have grown up to 45 percent more&#13;
(depending on the type of the herd) in the with-project case than without. The incremental benefit&#13;
resulting from the value of milk, meat, hides and manure would be 41 percent to 51 percent higher in the&#13;
with-project case.&#13;
B. Project-Level Economic Analysis&#13;
7.8    Approach and assumptions (Implementation Manual, Annex 4). Economic benefits from the&#13;
project were determined on the basis of the following assumptions: (a) a project life of 20 years, 12&#13;
commencing with a one-year lag for the accrual of benefits; (b) an investment period of six years,&#13;
including the total costs of the research, agricultural service and farner organization components, but&#13;
excluding the costs of the support to the restructuring of AGRI-RA; (c) a without-project situation&#13;
generally increasing slightly because of inputs remaining from the predecessor project and informal&#13;
transfer of technology through other than project channels ( including herds that were assumed to grow&#13;
in both cases); (d) all prices of outputs and inputs expressed in 1996 constant economic values; and (e)&#13;
an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. For internationally traded commodities such as rice and&#13;
cotton, import parity farm-gate prices were used.&#13;
7.9    The number of typical farms or herd owners that would adopt technical farm or livestock&#13;
packages and benefit from the full impact of this adoption was estimated by the mission on the basis of&#13;
the adoption rates reported under the ongoing project (PRSAP I) by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit&#13;
of the DVA of AGRI-RA. The adoption rates used in the base case of the present economic model are on&#13;
average 40 percent higher than the adoption rates reported for Phase I; they vary from 10 to 15 percent&#13;
of the total number of existing farms according to the ecological zone and the type of farm. In the farm&#13;
models, a farm that adopts the proposed technical package in project year (PY) n is supposed to reach the&#13;
yield objectives in year n+4. For each PY, one sixth of the total target standard farms (total target is 10&#13;
to 15 percent of the existing farms) are assumed to adopt the proposed technical package. Every five&#13;
years the benefits are reduced by 30 percent to take into account periodical drought.&#13;
2 / The economic analysis was computed at appraisal for a six-year project period. Because this project is&#13;
a second phase of a longer term-program, the computation period was not changed at post-appraisal&#13;
when the project period was reduced to four years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
7.10   Project costs in the economic analysis. The costs used in the economic analysis of the project&#13;
contain incremental costs of investment and recurrent costs, including physical contingencies, for both&#13;
the research and agricultural services component. Cost of support to the restructuring of AGRI-RA is&#13;
excluded from the economic analysis. The base case takes into account only costs of staff under contract&#13;
to be financed by the proposed IDA Credit (which represents a small proportion of the total staffing costs&#13;
necessary to implement the project).&#13;
7.11   Economic rate of return and net present value. Based on the foregoing assumptions, the&#13;
economic rate of return calculated for NASDP II is estimated at 39 percent with a net present value&#13;
(NPV) of CFAF 58 billions at an opportunity cost of investment capital (OCIR) of 12 percent.&#13;
7.12   The costs of the project's main components can also be expressed as percentage of agricultural&#13;
GDP. For agricultural research, the costs are about 0.5 percent of the agricultural GDP and for&#13;
agricultural extension a little less. In relation to public expenditure, the demand of counterpart funds for&#13;
the implementation of the project, about US$1.5 million equivalent per year, would equal about 2.1&#13;
percent of the 1997 government budget for all projects.&#13;
7.13   Sensitivity analysis. The following factors were determined as likely to affect project viability:&#13;
decrease in assumed incremental benefits linked to lower yields and/or lower adoption rates; increase in&#13;
costs of rural labor; increase in project costs; and delayed project impact and benefits. For a given&#13;
percentage of variation from the base case of one given variable, the corresponding ERR was computed&#13;
(Annex 4, Appendix C). The ERR is not very sensitive to changes in individual variables. For instance,&#13;
a 60 percent reduction in the projected incremental farm and livestock output, or both combined, would&#13;
still give an estimated ERR of 23 percent, 33 percent, and 19 percent, respectively. A 100 percent&#13;
increase in the cost of labor, a 20 percent increase in total project costs, and a two-year delay in project&#13;
implementation would still allow an ERR at 30 percent, 31 percent and 27 percent, respectively. The&#13;
switching value analysis, using 12 percent opportunity cost of capital, would allow the project costs to&#13;
increase by 350 percent before the project net present value (NPV) would be equal to zero.&#13;
VIII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification&#13;
8.1    Project benefits. The programs supported by the project are expected to help increase&#13;
agricultural productivity and develop sustainable production systems for rainfed crops, irrigated crops&#13;
and livestock production for the domestic market and for export. These form a set of direct quantifiable&#13;
benefits used in the financial and economic analysis (Chapter 7). Direct but non-quantified benefits&#13;
under the proposed project are: improved nutritional status of rural households through diversification of&#13;
cropping systems and increase of milk and meat consumption; increased employment; human resource&#13;
development, including improved literacy and numeracy; and improved productivity of on rural women&#13;
through targeting part of the extension information to women farmers. Indirect project benefits, also not&#13;
quantified in this analysis, derive from enhancing of food security in poor rural households, allowing&#13;
subsistence producers to replenish stocks of food and seeds, which are usually reduced or depleted&#13;
during the lean season. The project would also promote somewhat increased use of fertilizer, leading to&#13;
improved soils to better sustain smallholder farming activities, as well as environmentally friendly&#13;
farming practices.&#13;
8.2    Farmers' access to inputs, availability of credit, and post-harvest technologies are expected to&#13;
improve during the project period. Institution building under the project would improve the efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
and effectiveness of both the public agricultural services and farmer organizations. In liaison with the&#13;
Agriculture SECAL, the public agricultural services would be restructured to focus on appropriate&#13;
research and extension and become more cost-efficient. By improving the managerial capacity and&#13;
economic power of farmer organizations, the program would contribute to improved welfare of farmers&#13;
and rural poor, and to increase added value of agricultural products. The project would also promote the&#13;
rural private sector by creating an enabling environment for farmer organizations and local traders to&#13;
take on roles as marketers of inputs, a role that would be transferred to them from the CRPAs.&#13;
8.3.   Environmental issues. The main potential environmental issue concerns the possibility of&#13;
longer-term farm land degradation resulting from the adoption of more intensive but not sustainable&#13;
production systems. However, the agricultural research, extension, and on-farm adaptation programs&#13;
would emphasize sustainable land and water resource management and agroforestry as part of the&#13;
technology packages to be promoted to farmers. The project would be closely linked with the Natural&#13;
Resources Management Project and would extend the technology developed under that project to more&#13;
numerous farm communities. Moreover, adoption of better farming techniques on farmed land would&#13;
reduce the necessity of expanding agriculture into more marginal lands. The project would not involve&#13;
any resettlement of people or financing of agrochemicals. The proposed project is designed to promote&#13;
environmentally sustainable agriculture. At initial project identification and in line with general regional&#13;
policy regarding agricultural services projects, this project was classified as Category C. However,&#13;
preappraisal review determined that it should be classified as Category B. Consequently, the&#13;
Government will need to carry out a targeted environmental analysis according to Bank guidelines. At&#13;
the time of negotiations, the consultants for environmental analysis had been invited to make proposals&#13;
for the assignment. Completion of this study would be a condition of effectiveness of the project.&#13;
(Environmental effects are also discussed in Annex VI of the Project Implementation Manual.)&#13;
8.4    Program Objectives and Poverty Categories. The Poverty Profile 1996 shows that the incidence&#13;
of poverty is 52 percent in subsistence agriculture, substantially higher than for the population in general&#13;
(35 percent). Rural areas must therefore become the focal point of public service delivery and efforts to&#13;
improve access to financial resources. The smallholder farmers, including women, being the main target&#13;
group of this project, the main program objectives would be the alleviation of rural poverty and farmer&#13;
empowerment. The applicable Targeted Intervention Categories are expected to be Raising Productivity&#13;
and Poverty Alleviation.&#13;
8.5    Participatory Approach. Project preparation relied mainly on documents prepared by the&#13;
implementing agencies and experience gained over the last 6 to 7 years in implementing a similar project&#13;
in Burkina Faso. Project preparation work was done entirely by staff of the two ministries involved in&#13;
the project. Early client consultation started in 1995, at which time AGRI-RA began a process of&#13;
preparing a participatory action plan, with an adequate focus on women, as well as obtaining the&#13;
viewpoints of the involved agencies, particularly smallholder farmers and their organizations. Work&#13;
performed by consultants under this assignment was extensively discussed at regional and national&#13;
workshops and conferences before preappraisal. On the side of agricultural research, the research&#13;
institutes have been year involving farmer organizations in their work for a year or two by making&#13;
contracts on research assignments of direct interest to the members of these organizations. In the future,&#13;
farmers' participation in the Agricultural Services Program, including agricultural research, will be&#13;
strengthened by enhancing the capacity of farmers' organizations to participate in planning,&#13;
implementation and evaluation at different levels, including workshops on a strategy for agricultural&#13;
services, regional technology reviews, diagnosis at village and farm levels, program evaluations and&#13;
impact assessments. The participatory approach will be based on methodology and experience already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
well established for developing village land management plans (gestion des terroirs). The principle of&#13;
participatory approach has been agreed with the Government at the initial stage of preparation.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
8.6    Besides the climatic uncertainties, the main project risks--impossible to quantify--are: (a)&#13;
potential reversal of sound economic policies, including implementation of the proposed restructuring of&#13;
AGRI-RA; (b) inadequate counterpart funding; and (c) constraints to achieving better efficiency of&#13;
extension services, including potential lack of inputs. The approach used in this report was to analyze&#13;
the factors involved, assess their impact on project outcomes, establish a subjective probability of their&#13;
likely occurrence based on country information and field knowledge, and propose mitigating measures&#13;
that can be taken by (he Borrower (Implementation Manual, Annex 4, Appendix C).&#13;
8.7    According to this analysis, the high-risk factors for project implementation appear to be the&#13;
potential lack of counterpart funding l and less-than-needed efficiency of the project institutions. These&#13;
have been taken into account in designing the project as follows:&#13;
-    Agricultural policies and restructuring of AGRI-R4. Many of the sector issues that often&#13;
hinder agricultural development are unlikely to affect this project. Most of these issues began&#13;
to be addressed under the Agricultural Adjustment Credit program (SECAL I) and they should&#13;
be resolved during the Second National Agricultural Adjustment Credit program (SECAL II).&#13;
They include improvement in the performance of public-sector institutions supporting&#13;
agricultural development and competitiveness of key subsectors (rice, sugar, cotton and&#13;
livestock). These improvements, if implemented, would support the effect of the investments&#13;
under this project. To reduce the risk of implementation failure or delay, the project would&#13;
provide funds to facilitate the restructuring of AGRI-RA and would include conditionalities to&#13;
ensure that the deadlines are met.&#13;
-    Counterpartfunds. Delayed provision of counterpart funds, a problem experienced in the past,&#13;
would be reduced by adapting the project scope and the share of recurrent costs to be financed&#13;
by the Borrower to the Borrower's financial capacity, and seeking a relatively high level of&#13;
IDA financing as requested by the Government. Increasing assistance from other multilateral&#13;
and bilateral donors, usually in the form of grants, is also expected to facilitate achievement of&#13;
project objectives.&#13;
-    The efficiency of the extension services. Inefficiencies could result from a possible lack of&#13;
adapted technologies and lower-than-projected adoption rates by producers. These&#13;
inefficiencies would be mitigated by implementing regional technology reviews, improving&#13;
linkages between research and extension, developing participatory approaches and getting&#13;
farmer organizations involved in planning and deciding on the type and quality of agricultural&#13;
services and establishing priorities and adapting the pace of program implementation.&#13;
13/ The Government has provided the requested counterpart funds under the predecessor projects during&#13;
the recent years, but the amounts have been smaller that during the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(EPA) would be prepared and its results implemented during the first project year (6.18);&#13;
(h) when selecting farmer organizations to benefit from project funds, the project authorities would&#13;
use criteria and a process acceptable to IDA (6.22);&#13;
(i) payment for specialized advisory services to pigs and poultry producers would be progressively&#13;
introduced (4.14; 6.19);&#13;
(j) preparation of the Human Resource Development Plans would be based on skill-gap analysis and&#13;
annual training programs be reviewed by IDA before being implemented (6.27);&#13;
(k) consultants would be recruited--using procedures acceptable to IDA--to help establish a&#13;
coordinated monitoring system and carry out independent impact evaluations(6.28); and&#13;
(I) semiannual progress reports and the midterm review would be prepared within three months&#13;
from the end of the reporting period and the Implementation Completion Report within six&#13;
months (6.30 -6.31);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
9.1    The conditions for the effectiveness of the Credit would be as follows:&#13;
(a) agricultural research: (i) presentation to IDA of a manual for CNRST on financial control and&#13;
external audits and a manual on the procedures of evaluating the researchers; and (ii) adoption&#13;
by CNRST of a manual of procedures for the approval of programs and their monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; and (iii) adoption by INERA and IRSAT of an internal management manual (6.4);&#13;
(b) animal health: improving the enabling environment for private animal health operators with the&#13;
following measures: (i)) promulgation of a decree ('arr&amp;e) requiring full recovery of costs by&#13;
AGRI-RA for public sector services that can be supplied by private veterinarians (treatment of&#13;
animals, non-obligatory vaccinations, sale of pharmaceutical products), including provisions for&#13;
their annual updates; and (ii) promulgation by the Government of a decree governing the&#13;
subcontracting ("mandat sanitaire") of public sector tasks, such as meat inspection and&#13;
compulsory vaccination (4.14);&#13;
(c) counterpartfunding: depositing in the Project Account of the respective project implementation&#13;
agencies (CU, INERA and IRSAT) the Government's share of project expenditures for three&#13;
months (5.3);&#13;
(d) audit: employment of independent auditors for the project implementation units (5.7); and&#13;
(e) environment: completion of a targeted environmental analysis by consultants (8.3).&#13;
9.3    The dated covenants of the Credit would be as follows:&#13;
(a) agricultural research: (i) CRNST would take into use the new criteria for evaluation and&#13;
promotion of researchers before December 31, 1998 (6.10); and (ii) CRNST would start using&#13;
latest by December 31, 1998 a set of evaluation criteria for determining the annual merit&#13;
increases for all personnel who contribute to research work (6.11);&#13;

institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems similar to INERA (5.4);&#13;
and&#13;
(c) reorganization ofAGRI-RA: (i) redeployment of personnel and organizing the related transfers as&#13;
per the reorganization plan before June 30, 1998. These arrangements would need to include&#13;
separation of the control and advice functions at the level of field agents and unification of the&#13;
available livestock personnel into the national extension system, based on annual action plans for&#13;
each province; and (ii) completion of financial audits of the assets and liabilities of the ex-&#13;
CRPAs by an independent /audit firm no later than April 30, 1998; (iii) and liquidation of the&#13;

SECOND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
-A. -Procurement&#13;
1.    All goods and services financed under the IDA Credit would be procured in accordance with&#13;
IDA guidelines of goods, works and services (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits, January 1995 and as revised in January and August 1996 (Procurement Guidelines) and&#13;
Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
January 1997 (Consultant Guidelines). Contracts to supply goods and equipment, vehicles, and civil&#13;
engineering services for the project would be put up for bid and awarded by the project implementation&#13;
units (Project Coordination Unit for AGRI-RA, and INERA and IRSAT for MESSRS), or, if above their&#13;
approval limits, by the authorized bodies in the Government system (the respective Ministry and the&#13;
National Procurement Office). Preference for domestically manufactured goods in ICB will apply in&#13;
accordance with World bank Guidelines.&#13;
Contracts for civil works&#13;
2     All bidding documents and contracts in this category except small rehabilitationworks and works&#13;
for the pilot component "small rural infrastructures"valued at less than US$50,000 each, would be procured&#13;
through NCB and reviewed by IDA. Rehabilitationand constructionworks would usually be grouped into&#13;
regional lots to enable local small and medium-size enterprises to participate in the bidding, although&#13;
overseas firms and firms from elsewhere in the country may also bid. Documentation acceptable to IDA&#13;
would be required. Contracts for the pilot components,estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent,&#13;
could be made by using "communityparticipation"method, followingproceduresstated in the&#13;
Implementation Manual, acceptable to IDA, with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
Contracts for vehicles. goods and equipment&#13;
3.    Contracts for vehicles, goods and equipmentwould be grouped by lots. All lots valued at over&#13;
US$200,000 would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure based on use&#13;
of the World Bank model documentation. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA could be used for contracts in the range of US$50,000 to US$200,000. IDA's prior approval of the&#13;
bidding documents and contract would be required for ICB and NCB procurement. Contracts under&#13;
US$50,000 to purchase vehicles and small equipment, which should not exceed a total of US$2 million&#13;
during the project, may be awarded on the basis of local or international shopping, provided at least three&#13;
competent competitorsare invited to bid. The implementation units would be requested to prepare a&#13;
computer-based system to monitor that the aggregate amounts agreed upon will not be exceeded (see&#13;
para 5).&#13;

5.    Monitoring of contracts. The Administration and Finance Section of Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) in AGRI-RA, and INERA and IRSAT under CNRST, would set up a computerizeddata base for&#13;
monitoringprojectprocurementcontractsand keep it up to dateatall times. A contractstatusstatementfor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

each project componentwould be a mandatorypart of the progress report submitted to IDA two weeks prior&#13;
to each half-yearly supervision mission. Component contract managers would be invited to take part in the&#13;
technical training sessions regularly organized by the World Bank for the benefit of the subregion, the&#13;
expenses involved being eligible for inclusion as project costs.&#13;
6.     Procurement schedules. Procurement packages will be based on the detailed cost tables of the&#13;
project and procurement schedules would be prepared by project implementation units before&#13;
negotiations on the basis of the cost tables to be discussed at appraisal. The schedules would be updated&#13;
annually and maintained as part of this Annex of the Implementation Manual (Appendices I - 3).&#13;

7.     Measures to ensure adequateprocurementcapacity. The PIU at AGRI-RA and INERA already&#13;
have substantial experience in the use of the Bank's procurement guidelines. At the beginning, the&#13;
ProcurementOfficerof [NERA would assist IRSAT to get its procurementoperationsstarted. However, in&#13;
the longer run also IRSAT needs to engage and train its own procurement officer. The measures to ensure&#13;
otherwise high qual ity of procurementoperations include:&#13;
- standardprocurementprocessingtimetables,includinggestiontimeforcompletionofdeliveries;&#13;
- a draft procurement schedule for the project period, to be updated annually;&#13;
- post-reviewsby the Bank staffand a third part (procurementagentsand auditors); and&#13;
-      - supplementaryand state-of-the-arttraining ofthe procurementstaff in the implementation units.&#13;
8.     Documents to be used:&#13;
- for ICB: World Bank Standard Bidding Documents;&#13;
- for NCB: Standard bidding documents based on the Bank's SBD;&#13;
- for consultants: the Bank's standard contracts; samples for Letters of Invitation (LOI) and&#13;
Supplementary Information to Bidders; and&#13;
- other documents include: the Bank's standard bid evaluation form and standard general and&#13;
specific procurement notices.&#13;
B. Disbursementof IDA Credit&#13;
9.    In view of Burkina Faso's difficult macroeconomic situation, IDA would finance 100 percent of&#13;
project costs less taxes in categories other than civil works, contractual staff salaries and operating costs. In&#13;
thesecategoriesthe Government'scontributionwould be 5 percent,25 percentand 25 percent,respectively.&#13;
The Governmentwould pay, through budgetaryarrangements,an estimated CFAF 3.1 billion (US$6&#13;
million),or 12.5 percentoftotal cost, plus taxes on the items procured underthe project. If therewould be&#13;
local purchases of equipment and vehicles, IDA financing would be 90 percent.&#13;
10.    The Disbursement Division of the World Bank (LOAAF) would send a Disbursement Letter to&#13;
the Government once the project has been approved. The Letter, giving details of the disbursement&#13;
procedures, would be attached to the Implementation Manual as Annex III. It would contain, inter alia,&#13;
the following information:&#13;
(a) Disbzursement conditions: disbursement against all categories of the Credit would be allowed&#13;
at the effectiveness of the project, except that: (i) disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be&#13;
authorized once the institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems&#13;
similar to INERA; and (ii) the research agencies would have authority to withdraw funds&#13;
against the civil works, goods and equipment and training after the institutes have prepared a&#13;
development plan for the respective Centre, a plan of goods and equipment to be purchased&#13;
(both these plans approved by the planning commissions), and an annual training plan (agreed&#13;
upon with IDA), respectively;&#13;
(b) Use of statement of expenses: all replenishmentapplicationsshould be fully documented except&#13;
for contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent for civil works, goods and equipment,&#13;
consultant firms (US$20,000 for individual consultants),training, studies and operating costs,&#13;
which would be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures(SOEs); and&#13;

(c) SpecialAccount.- (denominated in CFAfrancs). theauthorizedallocationswouldamountto&#13;
CFAF 500 million for AGRI-RA, CFAF 400 million for INERA and CFAF 100 million for&#13;
IRSAT, and would cover about four months of eligible expenditures. IDA would depositthe&#13;
authorized allocation as per the Development Credit Agreement in each Special Account upon&#13;
effectiveness, except in the case of IRSAT where disbursement of funds to IRSAT would be&#13;
authorized once the institute has implemented accounting and financial management systems&#13;
similar to [NERA. The Special Accounts would be for payments below CFAF 50 million,&#13;
representing 20 percent of the authorized allocation. For direct payment: minimum application&#13;
amount would be above 20 percent of the Special Account deposit.&#13;

            Burkina Faso - Second National Agricultural
            Services Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Second National Agricultural
            Services Development Project aims to: (i) support long-term
            agricultural production; (ii) increase agricultural and
            livestock productivity and farmers' revenues; (iii)
            improve natural resource management and promote sustainable
            production systems; (iv) help the Government implement an
            improved animal health system, largely based on private
            veterinary services; and (v) promote and empower, on a pilot
            basis, representative farmers' organizations.  The
            project includes the following five main components: 1)
            agricultural research; 2) agricultural extension (rainfed
            and irrigated crops, livestock, natural resource
            management); 3) animal health and pastoralist promotion; 4)
            pilot programs consisting of: (a) promotion of farmer
            organizations; and (b) a program for small rural
            infrastructures to study the processes and feasibility of
            financing village-level operations intended for communal
            usage; and 5) restructuring of agricultural services.
