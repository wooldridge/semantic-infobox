ELECTRICITY MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1                Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. It has&#13;
a land mass that is the largest in Europe (with the exception of European Russia) and a population of 52&#13;
million that ranks fourth in Europe. GNP per capita was estimated at US$ 1,572 in 1994, down from&#13;
US$ 2,340 in 1991. The economy rests on industry and agriculture, which together accounted for more&#13;
than 70 percent of GDP in 1991. Ukraine, despite its size, is also heavily dependent on trade, notably&#13;
with the rest of the former Soviet Union (FSU).&#13;
1.2                The economic decline in Ukraine has been dramatic. Real GDP contracted by&#13;
59% percent between in 1991-1995 (although the official figures may overestimate the extent of the fall&#13;
in output, since the informal economy has been expanding out of reach of government regulations and&#13;
taxes). Due to loose fiscal and monetary policies, the rate of inflation reached 4,735 percent in 1993.&#13;
The external situation became increasingly tenuous, reflecting a significant trade deficit with the FSU --&#13;
about US$ 3 billion in 1993 -- which was only partially offset by a trade surplus with the rest of the&#13;
world. Developments in external trade were marked by a sharp contraction in trade volumes, a&#13;
considerable decrease in the terms of trade as import prices of energy moved towards world levels, and&#13;
a shift in the direction of trade away from the FSU towards the rest of the world. The foreign trade&#13;
deficit led to the increasing accumulation of arrears on payments for energy imports.&#13;
1.3                In July 1994, Ukraine elected a new President who called for a radical break from&#13;
the past in economic policies. A program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms was&#13;
developed and adopted. The budget deficit was reduced, monetary policy was tightened, and work was&#13;
started on mass and small scale privatization. Actions were taken to liberalize the economy. The&#13;
Government's economic program was supported by the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF approved,&#13;
in October 1994, a first purchase under the Systemic Transformation Facility (US$ 365 million), and the&#13;
World Bank approved, in December 1994, a Rehabilitation Loan of US$ 500 million. A second purchase&#13;
under the Systemic Transformation Facility (US$ 365 million) and a Standby Arrangement (US$ 1,494&#13;
million) were approved by the IMF in April 1995. In the second half of 1995, however, there were&#13;
slippages in the implementation of the stabilization program. A part (46%) of Ukraine's quota under the&#13;
Standby Arrangement was not disbursed due to the non-observance of agreed performance criteria. The&#13;
Government took a number of corrective measures in early 1996, and, in response, the IMF approved&#13;
a new Standby Arrangement in May 1996.&#13;
B. Overview of the Energy Sector&#13;
1.4                Energy Demand. Energy demand in Ukraine is characterized by high energy&#13;
intensity in relation to industrial output and the high share of industry in final energy consumption. This&#13;
is due to the high share of heavy industry (iron and steel, basic chemicals) and the low thermal efficiency&#13;
of energy consumption technologies. Energy consumption per capita was about 3,000 kilogram oil&#13;
equivalent (koe) in 1995, which is quite high even by Western European standards. Following a modest&#13;
decline of 11% between 1985 and 1990, the energy intensity of the offical GDP increased 60% in the&#13;
1991-1995 period reaching 5.2 koe/US$, a ratio that is several times higher than in developed countries&#13;
(the true energy intensity of GDP is likely to be substantially lower due to the large size of the shadow&#13;
economy, and the difference between the market exchange rate and purchasing power parity).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                         Sector Background&#13;
1.5                     Primary Energy Resources.  Ukraine has large, practically unlimited coal&#13;
resources. Donbass, the main mining basin, contains metallurgical coal, anthracite and high grade&#13;
thermal coals, as well as coalbed methane gas. The unusually difficult geological conditions (thin, steeply&#13;
inclined coal seams at great depth) in the central Donbass make the mining of coal costly and labor&#13;
intensive. Natural gas and crude oil resources are declining, but are still significant. Remaining proven&#13;
and probable reserves are 190 million tons of oil and 1,400 bcm of natural gas. The shallower and larger&#13;
oil and gas pools in the Dnieper-Donetsk and Carpathian regions are rapidly being depleted. These&#13;
deposits are replaced by reserves in smaller, deeper and less productive reservoirs, which are more&#13;
expensive to find, to drill-up and to produce, to the point that a large part of the reserves appear to be&#13;
uneconomic.&#13;

Sector Background                                                                     3&#13;
1.6          Energy Supply. Domestic energy production, consisting of fossil fuels and primary&#13;
electricity (hydro- and nuclear power), represented 45-50% of consumption in the 1990-1995 period (see&#13;
Table 1.1). Most of the decline in domestic energy production was due to decreased coal and natural gas&#13;
output. The main energy import items were crude oil and oil products, mostly from Russia, natural gas,&#13;
from Russia and Turkmenistan, and coal, from Russia and Poland. The cost of fossil fuel imports&#13;
reached about US$ 6 billion per year in 1993-95, creating a demand for foreign exchange that the&#13;
economy was unable to meet.  The difference was financed by payment arrears to Russia and&#13;
Turkmenistan (the arrears were subsequently converted to debt), and balance-of-payment support from&#13;
the IMF and the World Bank.&#13;
1.7          Energy Prices. Gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil prices are liberalized. Electricity, gas,&#13;
and coal prices are set by the central government. Local governments set the price of district heating,&#13;
LPG, heating oil, peat and wood. Household energy prices cover 50-80% of costs, with electricity prices&#13;
being the closest to full cost recovery. The difference between costs and prices is covered by subsidies&#13;
from the central and local governments, and also by a non-transparent surcharge on industrial consumers&#13;
(particularly for district heat). Even for electricity, there are several categories of households who are&#13;
entitled to discounts, and the cost of these discounts is borne by industrial consumers. Non-payment by&#13;
customers became a major problem for electricity, gas and heat suppliers in 1994-95, weakening the&#13;
financial position of the utilities. In September 1995, the Government issued a resolution on the&#13;
non-payment of energy bills requiring that all non-payers be disconnected, and also providing indemnity&#13;
to the energy suppliers for eventual damages on the consumer side. The implementation of the resolution&#13;
was unsatisfactory during the unusually cold winter of 1995/96, but it improved rapidly in mid-1996.&#13;
1.8          Sector Institutions. The main government agencies in the sector are the Ministry of Coal&#13;
Industry, the Ministry of Power and Electrification (Minenergo), the State Committee for Nuclear Energy&#13;
(Goskomatom) and the State Committee for the Oil and Gas Industry. In 1994-95, the Government&#13;
implemented a corporatization program in the oil, gas and power subsectors, with the long term objective&#13;
of privatizing most of the assets and activities except those that are considered of strategic importance&#13;
(e.g., oil, gas and electricity transmission lines, nuclear plants, dispatch centers). More details are&#13;
provided on the Government's program in the power industry in Section D below. The corporatization&#13;
program of the coal industry was started in 1996, parallel with a program to close uneconomic mines.&#13;
C. Power Industry Conditions and Priority Needs&#13;
1.9          The installed electricity generation capacity of the Ukrainian Power System (UPS) is about&#13;
53 thousand MW. It includes 14 thousand MW of nuclear capacity, located in five plants with a total&#13;
of 15 units in operation. There are more than 40 thermal (fossil fuel) power plants with conventional&#13;
steam cycle technology, with over 110 generating units and a total capacity of 32 thousand MW, of which&#13;
four thousand MW are combined heat-and-power units. Hydro capacity is close to five thousand MW,&#13;
stationed mostly in 9 plants with a total of 100 generating units. The capacity of industrial power plants&#13;
was about two thousand MW. The total effective generating capacity of the system is about 50 thousand&#13;
MW, due to the derating of older plants. Most older fossil fuel plants (about 23 thousand MW) use coal&#13;
as their primary fuel, but need gas or mazut for co-firing. About five thousand MW of power generation&#13;
as well as most of the combined heat-and-power plants run on gas or mazut as main fuels.&#13;
1.10         Electricity generation was 193 TWh in 1995, of which thermal plants produced 107 TWh,&#13;
nuclear plants 71 TWh, hydropower plants 10 TWh, and industrial plants 5 TWh (see Table 1.2). Net&#13;
export was 3 TWh (6 TWh export, 3 TWh import). Self-consumption of thermal plants was 9 TWh (or&#13;
about 8 % of their total generation), and of nuclear plants 5 TWh (7 % of generation). After accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                      Sector Background&#13;
for transrnission and distribution losses (23 TWh, or 12% of total generation) and net exports, net&#13;
domestic electricity consumption came to 151 TWh. Within this total figure, the two largest consumer&#13;
groups, industry and households, represented 54% and 18% of electricity consumption, respectively.&#13;
1.11            Electricity generation, domestic consumption and exports have all declined significantly&#13;
in recent years. Between 1990 and 1995, generation decreased by 35%, gross domestic consumption by&#13;
23 %, and net exports by 88%. The decline in generation and consumption is likely to continue for some&#13;
time (see Annex 1). Offically recorded GDP, however, declined even more (by almost 60%  in the same&#13;
period), and, as a result, the electricity intensity of GDP increased by 86% (the true increase in the&#13;
electricity intensity of the economy is likely to be substantially lower due to the growing share of the&#13;
shadow economy).&#13;

1.12            The Ukrainian power industry was developed and operated as a part of the integrated&#13;
power system of the FSU. During the last 15-20 years, investment policy favored the use of natural gas&#13;
and nuclear power at the expense of coal-fired plants. The aging coal plants, whose performance was&#13;
further affected by declining coal quality, have to use mazut or gas as supplementary fuels despite sharp&#13;
increases in the price of imported oil and gas after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The total fossil fuel&#13;
consumption of the thermal power plants consisted of 39.6 mt of coal, 14.4 bcm of gas, and 2.4 mt of&#13;
fuel oil in 1995, representing, respectively, 60%, 17% and 30% of the total domestic consumption of&#13;
these fuels. Due to the lack of rehabilitation and the postponement of maintenance, the availability of&#13;
some of these power plants decreased from  86%  in 1993 to less than 70%  in 1995.  There was a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sector Background                                                                        5&#13;
corresponding sharp increase in unplanned outages (from 3 to 8 outages per year), and also in heat rates&#13;
(by about 10% between 1993 and 1995).&#13;
1.13         Due to a number of factors such as insufficient payment collection and the lack of credit&#13;
(see Section A in Chapter II), the thermal power generation companies encountered a severe shortage of&#13;
working capital by the fourth quarter of 1995. In addition to the lack of spare parts and the postponement&#13;
of maintenance, fuel inventories (which also include on-site strategic national inventories) decreased to&#13;
abnormally low levels. Typical industry minimum inventory levels are 30-day supplies. In market&#13;
economies, a 60-day target inventory level is common for situations where fuel supply interruptions are&#13;
likely. In Ukraine, the actual 1995/96 average winter inventory was less than one-third of the 30-day&#13;
standard (about 20 days for coal and 7 days for mazut). In more than half of the power stations, coal&#13;
inventories are lower than 10 days. The fuel inventory crisis looks even more serious taking into account&#13;
the fact natural gas, for which on site storage space does not exist, makes up about half of the total fuel&#13;
consumption of the power sector, and other consumers (e.g., households) have the first call on gas&#13;
reserves.&#13;
1.14         By the middle of the winter, an estimated 4,000 MW generation capacity had to be taken&#13;
off-line due to fuel inventory shortage. The amount of constrained demand reached 6,000 MW (affecting&#13;
7,000 enterprises) during the 16-day coal miners strike in February 1996. Even after deducting the&#13;
demand that is likely to support uneconomic production from this figure, the cost of unserved energy to&#13;
the national economy must be very large. In addition, low inventories and the severe imbalance in&#13;
inventory allocations among power stations make optimal economic dispatch a largely impossible task.&#13;
Finally, the fuel inventory shortage adds a large element of uncertainty to the efficient operation of the&#13;
wholesale market (see Section D below on the wholesale market).&#13;
1.15         Nuclear power plants account for 26% of installed generating capacity. The 15 Soviet-&#13;
designed operating units include two RBMK graphite moderated reactors at Chemobyl of 2 x 1000 MW&#13;
nameplate capacity. Construction of two new nuclear units in Rovno and Khmelnitsky, each 1000 MW&#13;
of capacity, is in progress at varying degrees of completion. Sunk investments costs and the increasing&#13;
costs of imported fossil fuels are powerful incentives to complete these units. The April 1986 Chernobyl&#13;
accident brought to the forefront the issue of the safety of nuclear plants (see Annex 2). The G-7 Summit&#13;
Meeting held at Naples in July 1994 called for the phased closure of the Chernobyl plant and outlined&#13;
a broad Action Plan to this effect, including the completion of three new nuclear reactor units to adequate&#13;
safety standards, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants, energy policy reform, and energy&#13;
efficiency measures. In December 1995, the Ukrainian Government and the G-7 signed a Memorandum&#13;
of Understanding regarding the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant (see Section D below).&#13;
1.16         During the last three winters, the UPS was several times separated from the Russian&#13;
electricity system for extended periods. These forced separations from the hydro plants on the Volga&#13;
river that control system frequency revealed some serious structural and functional weaknesses with&#13;
negative consequences on overall system operation, security, reliability and quality of power supply.&#13;
Most of the plants in the UPS are base-loaded, with limited load-following capabilities, and the system&#13;
lacks peaking and spinning reserve capacity. Inability of the UPS to maintain the balance of supply and&#13;
demand in real time, as measured by the system frequency and power flows through the interconnections&#13;
with the neighboring systems, led to the separation of all neighboring systems, causing further&#13;
deterioration of system performance and reduction in export capacity. The existing peaking capacity is&#13;
provided by the hydro plants that are old and in need of rehabilitation. In view of unmet load-following&#13;
requirements and the high share of base-load plants, it is also necessary to enhance the regulating&#13;
capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                          Sector Background&#13;
1.17         The inadequate capacity to regulate frequency in Ukraine has led to frequency levels that&#13;
are not only unacceptable by international standards, but also damaging to rotating electric equipment both&#13;
in the consumption and generation side. Sometimes frequency drops below 49.2 Hz, while most well-&#13;
operated systems would not allow frequency fluctuations of more than +/- 0.01 Hz. Owing to the damage&#13;
done to electric equipment by substandard frequency, nuclear plants are normally taken out of service&#13;
when frequency drops below a certain level (this is set at 49.2 Hz in Ukraine). Yet, these plants are kept&#13;
on-line, even when frequency falls below the set point, because the authorities are reluctant to substitute&#13;
lost nuclear power with thermal generation due to the shortage of fossil fuels. Thus the safety of the&#13;
nuclear plants could be compromised. Therefore, enhancing the system's ability to better balance supply&#13;
and demand, and improve frequency regulation, would have significant nuclear safety benefits.&#13;
1.18         The current control system consists of a hierarchical, four level dispatch and supervision&#13;
system, and local automatic control subsystems at various facilities. At the top level of the dispatch&#13;
system is the National Dispatch Center in Kiev, linked to the eight regional dispatch centers, to some&#13;
hydro plants, and to 750 kV and 330 kV substations. The regional dispatch centers are connected to&#13;
power plants located within their respective regions, and to the local distribution centers (27 in total).&#13;
They also control the local 330 kV network and 330/110 kV substations. At the lowest, fourth level, are&#13;
single generating units at the plants, and district distribution centers, connected with the local distribution&#13;
centers. The system operation planning procedures are generally adequate, although there is space for&#13;
improvements. Computer models are used for the analysis of system performance and optimization of&#13;
regimes. The software, most of which is not portable, has been developed mainly in the central institutes&#13;
of the FSU and delivered without the source codes and, therefore, cannot be maintained and upgraded&#13;
locally. The real-time operation of the system is controlled manually, using telephone connections&#13;
between dispatchers in central and regional dispatch centers, and plant and substations operators. The&#13;
existing data acquisition and communication system is incomplete, and largely obsolete. No automatic&#13;
generation control or automatic load control is used.  Although these weaknesses are somewhat&#13;
counterbalanced by the high technical competence of the staff, the weaknesses inevitably contribute to&#13;
the low quality of electricity supply and operation inefficiencies.&#13;
1.19         The power transmission and distribution networks in Ukraine operate at levels of 0.4, 6,&#13;
10, 20, 35, 110, 150, 220, 330, 400, 500, 750 kV AC; there is also an 800 kV DC link with Russia.&#13;
Transmission levels are defined as 330 kV and above, while 220 kV and lower voltage networks belong&#13;
to distribution. Ukraine has interconnections with Central Europe (capacity 2000 MW), Russia (3900&#13;
MW AC, 200/250 MW DC), Romania/Bulgaria (3500 MW), Belarus (1000 MW), with a total effective&#13;
power transfer capacity that exceeds 20% of the domestic generating capacity. In general, the capacity&#13;
of the transmission network is sufficient, particularly under the current conditions of lower consumption&#13;
and reduced electricity trade. The 750 kV network was designed to become the main transmission&#13;
network, to serve Ukraine and to export electricity from Ukraine and Russia to Central Europe. As a&#13;
result of the large drop in electricity exports, load on the 750 kV lines is often light, and there is a&#13;
problem of compensating the reactive power the lines generate. Other than for some local interventions&#13;
(building a new substation instead of the one at Chernobyl, strenghtening the 750 kV lines connecting&#13;
some of the nuclear plants and the Dniester Pump Storage Plant that still have units under construction),&#13;
there does not seem to be a need for major new additions to the network in the short-to-medium term.&#13;
Expenditures should be focussed on the rehabilitation of older transmission and distribution lines.&#13;
Technical losses in the transmission and distribution network (about 4% and 9%, respectively) are not&#13;
excessive in international comparison, but have exhibited an increasing trend recently.&#13;
1.20         Electricity demand is expected to drop even further before it starts growing again, due&#13;
to a number of factors such as the general economic downturn, electricity price increases and economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Sector Background                                                                      7&#13;
restructuring. An analysis of least-cost investment options was conducted for the 1996-2010 period. The&#13;
analysis assumed that the Chernobyl units would be decommissioned until year 2000, and 2700 MW of&#13;
thermal capacity would be retired in the 1996-2010 period. The safety upgrade of all nuclear units was&#13;
also assumed (the upgrade requires each unit be taken off line for one year). The simulation of system&#13;
operation showed that the marginal cost of generation in the peak period was about 60% higher than the&#13;
marginal cost of generation at the minimal load. The completion of a pump storage plant on the Dniester&#13;
river was consistently part of the least cost solution, suggesting that the system needs the peaking capacity&#13;
provided by hydropower plants. This preliminary analysis also indicated that completing the nuclear units&#13;
that are in an advanced stage of construction is justified on the cost-of-operation basis, and that, after&#13;
these units are commissioned, there is no need for additional capacity until 2008 (i.e., there will be a&#13;
period of several years with significant capacity surplus in the system). Given that some of the plants&#13;
are quite old, it may be more cost-effective to retire them earlier than indicated in Minenergo's current&#13;
retirement plan. Those old coal-fired plants that are not retired and the hydropower plants will need to&#13;
be rehabilitated. More details are provided in Annex 1.&#13;
1.21         Total power generation investment requirements until year 2000 are preliminarily&#13;
estimated at US$ 3.5 billion, excluding construction costs of a new shelter for Chemobyl unit no. 4 (the&#13;
unit damaged in the 1986 accident). Of this total, US$ 1.7 billion is needed for nuclear power, including&#13;
US$ 0.4 billion for safety upgrades, US$ 0.4 billion for decommissioning and other works at Chernobyl,&#13;
and US$ 0.9 billion for the completion of new nuclear units. The rehabilitation of thermal and&#13;
hydropower plants and the partial completion of the Dniester PSP requires about US$1.8 billion. About&#13;
half of total investment costs would be incurred in foreign exchange.&#13;
1.22         Ukraine has a significant power engineering and manufacturing base. The "Turboatom"&#13;
and "Electrotyazhmash" fartories in Kharkov, for example, were among the largest producers of turbines&#13;
and generators in the FSU, with exports to many countries. However, domestic production capability&#13;
for some categories, notably high-voltage equipment, advanced power generating technology (gas&#13;
turbines, modern coal-burning technology, environmental protection equipment), and instrumentation,&#13;
control, communications and computing equipment, is limited or non-existent. Also, there seems to be&#13;
limited expertise available in modern computer-based software and methodology for system control, as&#13;
well as for least-cost investment planning and economic dispatch.&#13;
D. Government Policy and Strategy in the Power Industry&#13;
1.23         In 1992-93, the Government's reaction to the increase in the price of energy imports and&#13;
cost of energy supply was to rely on the methods of central planning such as price controls, cross-&#13;
subsidization among consumer classes, and the rationing of energy, rather than allowing market&#13;
mechanisms to regulate and balance supply and demand. The principal reason, presumably, was concern&#13;
about the political risk of increased unemployment inherent in market based solutions. Another prominent&#13;
concern was dependency on one supplier, Russia, for half of Ukraine's primary energy needs.&#13;
1.24         In late 1993, the Government prepared a "Concept for the Development of the Energy&#13;
Sector of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010". The "Concept" was subsequently approved by the&#13;
Parliament. It spelled out the following main directions for Ukraine's long-term energy strategy: (i) the&#13;
development and implementation of a policy that promotes energy savings; (ii) economically and&#13;
environmentally justified utilization of domestic energy sources; (iii) restructuring of the economy that&#13;
reduces the energy intensity of production; and (iv) increasing reliance on alternative (renewable) energy&#13;
sources. The investment program outlined in the "Concept" recognized the priority of rehabilitating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                       Sector Background&#13;
capacities in the power, coal, gas and oil subsectors, however, it also included a number of ambitious&#13;
expansion schemes in coal mining, oil and gas production, and nuclear power generation.&#13;
1.25         In early 1994, the Parliament passed a Law on Energy Conservation. The Law provides&#13;
economic incentives for investments in energy conservation, including subsidies and earmarked loans.&#13;
Specifically, it calls for the establishment of national and local extra-budgetary energy conservation funds&#13;
to support energy saving initiatives (however, it failed to specify the revenue sources of the funds). The&#13;
Law also contained a number of command-and-control type provisions such as penalties for "above the&#13;
norm" energy use. In order to prepare the necessary regulations and to coordinate the implementation&#13;
of the Law, a State Committee for Energy Conservation was established in July 1995 (a National Energy&#13;
Conservation Center was established under the Ministry of Power a year earlier, in 1994). The&#13;
Government approved the regulations for the operation of the national extra-budgetary energy&#13;
conservation fund in February 1996.&#13;
1.26         In mid-1995, the Government prepared and submitted to the Parliament the "National&#13;
Energy Program of Ukraine up to 2010". The "Program" was approved by the Parliament in early 1996.&#13;
It follows the main policy directions established in the "Concept". For the power industry, the&#13;
"Program" divides the next 15 years into two periods: the period of stabilization in 1996-2000, and the&#13;
period of development in 2001-2010. Taking into account expected energy savings of 6-8 TWh/year in&#13;
the first period and 30-35 TWh/year in the second period, the "Program" predicts that electricity&#13;
generation will not reach the 1990 level before 2010. Investments in the 1996-2000 period will focus&#13;
on the rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants. In addition to extending the life of these plants,&#13;
rehabilitation would be aimed at maximizing the use of domestic coal, and improving plant reliability and&#13;
environmental performance. Planned investments in new capacity in the same period would include the&#13;
completion of pump storage (Dniester 2) and nuclear plants (Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky 2) currently under&#13;
construction. In order to meet the expected increase in demand for electricity after 2000, the "Program"&#13;
recommends the construction of additional pump storage (Kanev), hydro (Tisa), nuclear (Khmelnitsky&#13;
3 and 4) and thermal power (about 3500 MW) capacity, while continuing the rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of existing thermal and hydropower plants in the 2001-2010 period.&#13;
1.27         Both the "Concept" and the "Program" recognize the need for various measures to&#13;
upgrade the safety of nuclear power plants. The "Program" notes that the timing of the closure of the&#13;
two remaining units of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant will depend on the technical status of the units&#13;
and the financial resources available.  In December 1995, the Ukrainian Government signed a&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the closure of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.&#13;
The MOU records the agreement between the Governments of the G-7 countries, the Commission of the&#13;
European Communities and GOU on the "elaboration and implementation of a Comprehensive Program&#13;
to support the decision of Ukraine to close the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant by the year 2000". The&#13;
"Comprehensive Program" includes (i) the restructuring of the power sector to develop a financially&#13;
sound electricity market; (ii) an investment program to rehabilitate thermal and hydro plants, complete&#13;
pumped storage units and nuclear reactors in Khmelnitsky and Rovno, and to implement energy efficiency&#13;
projects; (iii) nuclear safety improvements including the short term safety upgrade for Chernobyl unit no.&#13;
3, decommissioning of the Chernobyl Plant, and dealing with the shelter for Chernobyl unit no. 4; (iv)&#13;
a plan to address the social impacts of the closure of the Chernobyl plant; and (v) identification and&#13;
mobilization of internal and international financing to fund the above activities, with loans considered for&#13;
revenue generating projects, and grants and domestic resources for non-revenue generating projects. The&#13;
signatories and the international financial institutions will meet annually to monitor the implementation&#13;
of the "Comprehensive Program".&#13;

Sector Background                                                                     9&#13;
1.28         In May 1994, the President of Ukraine issued Decree No. 244 "On the Market&#13;
Transformation of the Power Sector of Ukraine" which stipulated the unbundling of the power sector of&#13;
Ukraine and the development of a competitive national wholesale market for electricity. As a result of&#13;
Decree No. 244 and other acts of government, today Ukraine's power sector is organized as follows (see&#13;
also Figure 1):&#13;
The 14 largest thermal power plants are owned and operated by four joint stock&#13;
generation companies: Donbassenergo operates five plants (7770 MW total capacity),&#13;
Dniproenergo operates three plants (8400 MW), Tsentrenergo operates three plants (7800&#13;
MW), and Zakhidenergo also three plants (4680 MW).&#13;
*     Two joint stock corporations own and operate the 8 hydropower stations on the Dnieper&#13;
river and the three hydropower stations on the Dniester river.&#13;
*     A state grid company owns and operates the high-voltage network (220 kV and above).&#13;
*     Twenty seven joint stock companies (oblenergos) own and operate the low-voltage&#13;
networks and some generation capacity in the 25 oblasts and two city administrations&#13;
(Kiev and Sevastopol).&#13;
*     A nuclear generation company (Ukrenergoatom) has been formed on the basis of the&#13;
country's five nuclear plants (although the plants have retained their status as separate&#13;
legal entities).&#13;
*     A National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was established in 1995. NERC&#13;
issues and monitors licenses for electricity generation, high voltage transmission, low&#13;
voltage distribution, and tariff and non-tariff supply. NERC's task is also to promote&#13;
competition, protect consumers, oversee the operation of the electricity market, regulate&#13;
prices for high- and low-voltage network operators, and set the margins for tariff&#13;
suppliers (i.e., oblenergos when providing service to small, captive consumers). In&#13;
February 1996, GOU issued Resolution 207 "On Provisions for the Operation of the&#13;
Electricity Wholesale Market of Ukraine". Resolution 207 ordered NERC, Minenergo&#13;
and the Ministry of Economy to determine a mechanism for the transition of market&#13;
based retail electricity prices for all groups of consumers in 1996.&#13;
*     Generation companies, the grid company and oblenergos signed the Energomarket&#13;
Members Agreement (EMA) on March 21, 1996 (independent or non-tariff suppliers are&#13;
expected to sign following the receipt of their licences from NERC). The EMA assigns&#13;
the task of operating and administering the wholesale electricity market (called&#13;
Energomarket) to the National Dispatch Center (NDC), a state owned company. The&#13;
wholesale market started to operate on April 10, 1996. NDC's main functions include:&#13;
(i) the control and financing of the high voltage grid; (ii) the purchase and dispatch of&#13;
power capacity and electricity; (iii) the purchase of ancillary system services; and (iv) the&#13;
administration of the settlements system (including the administration of market funds).&#13;
Technical and financial market operations are govemed by a set of Market Rules&#13;
described in the EMA. The price of electricity purchased from thermal (and later also&#13;
from nuclear) power plants is set on the basis of a bidding process. In addition to&#13;
determining in every hour the system purchase and selling prices, NDC continues to be&#13;
responsible for generation plant scheduling and dispatch, and the maintenance of system&#13;
stability. NDC's settlements responsibilities include creating payments orders and&#13;
clearing payments among market participants.&#13;

1.29         The Government has summarized its medium term strategy for the power industry in a&#13;
"Statement of Electricity Policy", transmitted to the Bank in a letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister&#13;
Anatoliy Kinakh on September 16, 1996.  Among other things, the "Statement" discusses the&#13;
strengthening of the regulatory body, improvements in payment collections, reduction of subsidies, and&#13;
development and implementation of a program to privatize thermal power generation and distribution&#13;
companies (see Annex 3 for a translation of the "Statement").&#13;
E. Bank Strategy and Experience&#13;
1.30         The Bank's overall objective is to support Ukraine's efforts to accelerate structural&#13;
reforms, and to promote efficient investments in high priority sectors in order to complete the transition&#13;
of the country to a market economy, accelerate the rate of economic growth, and increase efficiency.&#13;
This will require strengthening key financial institutions; accelerating privatization; extending the&#13;
openness of the policy environment; rehabilitating and re-orienting its physical infrastructure; and&#13;
extending the social safety net and the efficient delivery of social services. This cannot and need not be&#13;
done at the expense of the stabilization effort; in fact, many efficiency measures such as improved&#13;
infrastructure cost recovery are likely to be revenue enhancing.&#13;
1.31         The Bank approved the first loan for US$ 27 million equivalent to Ukraine in June 1993&#13;
(Ln. 3614-UA) to finance an Institution Building Project aimed at supporting enterprise reform, financial&#13;
sector reform, and public economic and financial management. The loan has disbursed only about 20&#13;
percent so far. The second Bank operation was a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln. 3831-UA) of US$ 500 million&#13;
equivalent approved in December 1994. The Loan provided financing for critical imports needed to stem&#13;
the decline in production and to cushion the deterioration of living standards of the population. The&#13;
implementation of the loan was satisfactory (it became effective five days after approval, and was&#13;
disbursed according to schedule). The third Bank operation was the Hydropower Rehabilitation and&#13;
System Control Project (Ln. 3865-UA) of US$ 114 million equivalent approved by the Board in April&#13;
1995, signed in September 1995, and declared effective in May 1996. Despite the lack of substantive&#13;
issues, the Government's approval process preceding the submission of loan documents to the Parliament&#13;
for ratification took several months. Learning from this experience, the Bank provided assistance to the&#13;
Government to simplify its loan approval procedures. The two most recently approved operations, the&#13;
Coal Pilot Project (Ln. 4016-UA) and the Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan (Ln. 4057-UA), have&#13;
reached effectiveness considerably faster.&#13;
1.32         The Bank has been involved in the Ukrainian energy sector since early 1992. An Energy&#13;
Sector Review (Report No. 11646-UA) was issued in 1993, leading to an Energy Strategy Conference&#13;
held in Kiev in June 1993. During the Conference, an understanding was reached that the Bank would&#13;
focus on power generation, gas transmission, and gas distribution, since these were the subsectors where&#13;
the Bank's contribution to policy development and financing of priority investments could make a&#13;
significant difference. It was also determined that lending operations should aim at the rehabilitation of&#13;
existing assets rather than capacity expansion, while supporting initiatives that increase the financial and&#13;
operational autonomy of enterprises and foster competition. After the Conference, the Government,&#13;
assisted by the Bank and other multi- and bilateral agencies, started the preparation of a number of&#13;
projects to rehabilitate hydropower plants, thermal power plants, and gas transmission, distribution and&#13;
metering facilities. The completion of a pump storage plant, restructuring of the coal industry, and&#13;
energy efficiency investments in district heating were added to the agenda in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                      Sector Background&#13;
1.33         Utilizing trust funds, the Bank provided technical services in the areas of industrial energy&#13;
audits, rehabilitation of themial and hydropower plants, gas distribution and metering, legislation for oil&#13;
and gas production, and power industry institutional reform. Decree 244/94 (see above) is one of the&#13;
regulatory and legislative acts that benefitted from these technical assistance activities. Following the&#13;
approval of the Decree, the Bank, jointly with Minenergo, organized a donor meeting in Kiev in July&#13;
1994. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure the availability of adequate technical assistance for the&#13;
implementation of this important reform initiative in the power industry. The donors offered technical&#13;
assistance of about US$ 4 million equivalent for the first year of the reform (including US$450,000 from&#13;
the Bank's Institutional Development Fund), and asked the Bank to assist the Government to coordinate&#13;
the implementation of the technical assistance program. Since mid- 1994, the technical assistance provided&#13;
by donors for the reform of the power industry has reached US$ 10 million. The proposed project would&#13;
both capitalize on the steps already undertaken, and provide leverage for the further implementation of&#13;
the reform.&#13;
1.34         The Bank has been actively supporting the dialogue between the G-7 and the Government&#13;
of Ukraine in the area of nuclear safety. In collaboration with EBRD, the Bank assisted the G-7 Nuclear&#13;
Safety Working Group to develop an Action Plan that includes the phased closure of capacity at&#13;
Chemobyl, the completion of replacement nuclear capacity, the safety upgrade of the remaining nuclear&#13;
units, the rehabilitation of non-nuclear power plants and energy efficiency improvements. The Bank&#13;
actively participated in the work of a joint Ukraine/G-7 Task Force that prepared the MOU signed in&#13;
Ottawa in December 1995 (see para. 1.27 above). Although the Bank will not finance nuclear power&#13;
investments, the support under the proposed project for pricing and institutional reforms is an important&#13;
contribution to the establishment of a framework that will facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
"Comprehensive Program". Furthermore, such projects as the Hydropower and System Control Project&#13;
and the planned Dniester Pumped Storage Project which will also positively affect the safety of the&#13;
operation of the nuclear plants (para. 1.17), and the planned Thermal Power Rehabilitation Project, are&#13;
key elements of the Action Plan.&#13;
1.35         A review of several decades of the Bank's worldwide lending for the power industry&#13;
found a declining trend in the industry's pricing, financial, technical and institutional performance, mainly&#13;
due to govemmental failure to address the industry's fundamental structural problems ("The World Bank's&#13;
Role in the Electric Power Sector", World Bank Policy Paper, Washington DC, 1993). Conflicts between&#13;
the govenmment's role as owner and its role as operator of utilities have led to poorly defined objectives,&#13;
govermment interference in daily affairs, and a lack of financial autonomy. The review recommended&#13;
that Bank lending for electric power should focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving the&#13;
perfomiance of the power industry by commercialization, corporatization and the establishment of a&#13;
transparent regulatory framework. The proposed project meets these criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                   13&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Concept and Objectives&#13;
2.1           The operation of thermal power plants is negatively affected by the shortage of working&#13;
capital (see para. 1.13 above). The shortage of working capital became particularly severe in the second&#13;
half of 1995, due to a number of reasons. First, some of the generation companies were established with&#13;
very little or negative working capital in July 1995 due to previously low electricity prices. Second, the&#13;
companies did not generate working capital because of insufficient collection of payments from final&#13;
consumers of electricity during 1995 (poor cash management practices also contributed to the problem,&#13;
see Section C of Chapter III). Insufficient payment collection was due to (i) the slow establishment of&#13;
a social safety net and tolerance of non-payment by residential consumers (as indicated by the across-the-&#13;
board abolishment of late payment penalties for households by the Government); (ii) inadequate or&#13;
delayed budgetary transfers to organizations that are financed fully or partially by central or local&#13;
government budgets (schools, hospitals, water supply and sewerage companies, etc.); (iii) unrealistic&#13;
expectations about the eventual bail-out of bankrupt state owned enterprises by the Government; and (iv)&#13;
political interference in the decisions about the disconnection of enterprises that have a prominent role&#13;
in the national or local economy.2 Third, the ability of domestic banks to provide credit for working&#13;
capital was limited due to the inadequate capitalization of these banks and political pressures to direct&#13;
their resources to other sectors (e.g., agriculture, coal and steel industries). The lending capacity of the&#13;
banks was also undermined by a dramatic decline in the willingness of the public to keep deposits in local&#13;
banks.&#13;
2.2           In 1995, an increasing number of private brokers entered the electricity supply business.&#13;
Their appearance was a natural response to the shortage of cash and the proliferation of inter-enterprise&#13;
arrears. Typically, these brokers arrange for fuel to be delivered to power plants in return for a certain&#13;
share (70-80%) of the electricity generated. This electricity, after the deduction of 30-40% to cover the&#13;
cost of dispatch, transmission and distribution, is delivered to specific customers in return for goods or&#13;
cash payments. These toll-generation (called "transit electricity") arrangements represented 50% or more&#13;
of generation by some of the power plants by the end of 1995. For the generation companies, there are&#13;
little commercial risks associated with these deals, however, the proper recording and administration of&#13;
these transactions is beyond the ability of the settlements system as operated by NDC and the oblenergos.&#13;
Another response to the cash shortage has been the growth in barters. A typical example is the payment&#13;
for coal transportation services with electricity as practiced by thermal power plants, or the trading of&#13;
equipment for electricity by the nuclear plants. These direct sales (called "addressnaya prodazha") are&#13;
useful when they result in a reduction in the arrears of an otherwise insolvent customer (such as the&#13;
railways), but could be harmful when replace cash payments from a solvent customer.&#13;
2.3           The recently started wholesale electricity market is able to accommodate both type of&#13;
deals in a transparent and efficient manner. Both the brokers and the generation companies can request&#13;
(independent or non-tariff) supply licences, and sign fixed price (or price insurance) contracts with&#13;
customers (and generation companies). Because all electricity is sold to the suppliers by Energomarket&#13;
at prices that change hourly (reflecting changes in the marginal cost of generation), these fixed price&#13;
contracts between suppliers and customers on the one hand, and suppliers and generation companies on&#13;
the other hand, have the practical effect of reallocating the risk of price movements among market&#13;
2/     Non-technical losses or unaccounted-for-electricity have remained low so far (all consumers are metered), although there are&#13;
indications that the theft of electricity is increasing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                              The Project&#13;
participants. The regulation of transmission and distribution companies through their licences will ensure&#13;
that all suppliers have equal access to the transmission and distribution networks, and pay the same price&#13;
for the use of these networks. This will be a significant improvement for brokers, and will reduce the&#13;
effort needed to conclude these transactions. However, barters that provide fuel at high costs will be&#13;
discouraged. Competition among the generation companies will exert pressure to reduce fuel costs by&#13;
rewarding those plants that obtain fuel at lower prices and improve the efficiency of fuel use.&#13;
2.4          The proper operation of the electricity wholesale market requires, among other things,&#13;
(i) improvements in payment collections at the level of the oblenergos in order to stop the hemorrhage&#13;
of financial resources; (ii) provision of working capital for the generation companies in order to enable&#13;
the power system to provide electricity to creditworthy customers; (iii) upgrading of the metering of&#13;
electricity flows in order to improve the recording and billing of transactions between market participants;&#13;
and (iv) improving financial management in the power industry, particularly in the National Dispatch&#13;
Center (NDC). In the fall of 1995, the Government of Ukraine asked both the European Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank to consider financing a project that would&#13;
address these issues. EBRD approved a loan of US$ 61.9 million to NDC for a Power Market&#13;
Development Project in December 1995. US$ 56.4 million of the EBRD loan is to be onlent by NDC&#13;
to the four thermal generation companies. Loan proceeds are to be used to finance repair and deferred&#13;
maintenance work at thermal power plants, metering and data acquisition equipment for the wholesale&#13;
market, and financial management and accounting systems for the generation companies. Due to its&#13;
relatively limited scope, the EBRD project covers only part of the urgent needs of the beneficiaries.&#13;
2.5          The preparations of the Electricity Market Development Project were started in January&#13;
1996. GOU asked for a project that would provide additional working capital for the generation&#13;
companies by building up fuel and spare parts inventories, a metering and communications component&#13;
for NDC, and technical services for project implementation and institutional strenghtening. The&#13;
specifications and quantity of fuels to be financed were prepared by the four thermal generation&#13;
companies. The generation companies also prepared the list of spare parts to be purchased and installed.&#13;
NDC, the designated operator of the wholesale market, was assisted by a consultant (KEMA) during the&#13;
preparation of the metering component (the consultant was funded by the Government of the&#13;
Netherlands). A Bank mission reviewed the preparation of the project in January/February 1996. The&#13;
project was appraised in May 1996.&#13;
2.6           The objective of the project is to support the development of a competitive electricity&#13;
market by providing working capital to thermal power generators for the purchase of fuel and spare parts,&#13;
and installing metering and communications equipment needed for the proper functioning of the&#13;
settlements system. The rules embedded in licences and agreements that govern the activities of market&#13;
participants and the operations of the market are expected to ensure that (i) prices are automatically&#13;
adjusted to reflect changes in costs; (ii) those distribution/supply companies who collect only part of the&#13;
payments from their customers receive electricity in proportion to their collection ratios; (iii) incentives&#13;
for barters are reduced, and remaining barter transactions are reported in monetary terms and&#13;
administered in a transparent manner; and (iv) billing and collection systems are improved according to&#13;
agreements signed by the members of the electricity market. These changes are expected to increase the&#13;
efficiency of resource allocation in the power industry, improve the financial position of the companies&#13;
so that they can finance working capital from retained earnings or through access to the financial markets,&#13;
and ensure that electricity demand is met at market clearing prices.&#13;
&#13;

The Project                                                                                               15&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
2.7             The project includes the following four components:&#13;
(a)     building up fuel stocks at 14 thermal power plants to levels that are consistent with&#13;
standard industry practices (about 40 days of stocks for coal and mazut);&#13;
(b)     building up the stocks of spare parts and carrying out deferred maintenance at 14 thermal&#13;
power plants;&#13;
(c)     installation of metering and communications equipment to improve recording and billing&#13;
of electricity flows at key wholesale market delivery points; and&#13;
(d)     technical services and training for project implementation, financial management, and the&#13;
development of a privatization program.&#13;

2.8               Fuel Inventory Buildup.  In order to prevent reoccurrence of disruptive fuel inventory&#13;
shortages during the 1996/97 winter period, the project aims at stocking up plant fuel inventories to a&#13;
minimum of 40 days. The inventory build requirements have been determined in the following way.&#13;
First, the 1996/97 winter burn rates were calculated for each power plant. "Normal winter" burn rates&#13;
were estimated by factoring in the fuel requirements of those units (about 4,000 MW) which were not&#13;
in operation during the 1995/96 winter period due to fuel shortage, while deducting the expected&#13;
reduction in demand for the output of thermal power plants in 1996/97 (about 2,400 MW compared to&#13;
1995/96). Inventory build requirements were then determined by multiplying the average "normal"&#13;
winter consumption rates by 40 days, and then subtracting the average winter inventories that the power&#13;
plants would hold under a "without project" scenario ("without project" inventories were proxied by&#13;
average inventory levels in the 1995/96 winter quarters). Calculation of mazut inventories includes the&#13;
mazut equivalent of 40-day consumption of natural gas to protect against possible interruptions of gas&#13;
deliveries by providing additional mazut inventory (natural gas storage space does not exist at the power&#13;
stations). The total inventory volumes required recognize the existing storage capacity limitations at each&#13;
station. The overall mix of operating units was adjusted relative to the 1995/96 winter period to reflect&#13;
optimal dispatching strategy. The results are presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Based on the 40-days fuel&#13;
inventory target, the total inventory buildup requirements for the four generation companies are about&#13;
2.6 million tons of coal and 0.6 million tons of mazut.&#13;

2.9           The expected benefits from the replenishment of fuel inventories are increases in plant&#13;
availability (see Section E in Chapter III). In order to sustain this benefit, the power plants will be&#13;
expected to maintain inventories for coal and mazut (including reserves to substitute for gas) at the&#13;
following minimal levels, starting January 1, 1997:&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the first quarter of a year;&#13;
-      20 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the second quarter of a year;&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the third quarter of a year;&#13;
-      40 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the fourth quarter of a year.&#13;
The winter consumption of the fuels is defined as the expected average daily consumption during the 4th&#13;
quarter of the year. If the specified levels of mazut reserves exceed the storage capacity, then the&#13;
minimal inventory level for mazut in such cases is defined as 75 % of the available storage capacity. The&#13;
specified minimal levels for each quarter will be reached for at least 10 days in each respective quarter.&#13;
The meeting of these targets will be an important indicator of project performance.&#13;
2.10          Spare Parts and Equipment for Maintenance. The component includes a list of specific&#13;
capital maintenance items to be procured under the project in order for the 14 main thermal power&#13;
stations to carry out urgent repairs and implement their deferred maintenance program. It also includes&#13;
building up of the inventory of spare parts in case of unpredicted failure of equipment. A list of&#13;
equipment has been prepared for each of the generation companies, taking into account their specific&#13;
needs and priorities (see Annex 4). The lists include the following groups of items:&#13;
-      coal storage and transportation equipment: mobile vehicles (bulldozers for coal storage&#13;
and ash dumping, tractors and scrapers) and related maintenance parts, and spare parts&#13;
for coal conveyors;&#13;
-      water demineralization equipment: chemicals, demineralizing resins, and pipes for&#13;
repair and maintenance;&#13;
-      boiler and mechanical equipment: spare high-pressure tubes for repair and maintenance&#13;
of boiler screens and wall-tubing, spare parts for repair of fans, exchangers, reheaters,&#13;
coal mills, turbine blades, circulating pumps, feedwater pumps, condensate and oil&#13;
pumps, air compressors, valves, bearings, synchronizers;&#13;
-      electrical equipment: transformers, circuit breakers, spare parts for electrical motors of&#13;
various sizes, batteries, cables;&#13;
instrumentation  and  control equipment: transducers, manometers, voltmeters,&#13;
temperature gauges, regulation devices, control mechanisms, metal laboratory equipment,&#13;
computers for communication and control system, control cables, test laboratory tools;&#13;
and&#13;
-      environmental impact mitigation and monitoring equipment: electrostatic precipitators,&#13;
gas analyzers, chromatographs, calorimeters, photocolorimeters, filters, stack control&#13;
equipment, ash and slag processing equipment.&#13;
2.11          The expected benefits from the spare parts and equipment component are increases in&#13;
plant availability (particularly a decrease in unplanned outages), and fuel efficiency (see Section E in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                                          The Project&#13;
Chapter III). The implementation of the planned maintenance program and the achievement of the&#13;
expected availability and fuel efficiency increases will indicate the performance of this component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.12           Metering and Communications. The restructuring of the power industry has changed&#13;
the number and the configuration of the business entities in the system, thereby increasing metering&#13;
requirements. Additional requirements will be created by the operation of the wholesale market due to&#13;
the planned hourly changes in the price of electricity. The existing metering equipment has inadequate&#13;
coverage and lower accuracy and reliability than in comparable foreign market situations. In the short&#13;
term, the gap between the technical requirements of the new system and the capabilities of existing&#13;
equipment will be bridged by the application of mutually agreed procedures to estimate power flows.&#13;
In the long term, however, settlements and accounting procedures will have to be based on hourly energy&#13;
balances for all commercial entities operating on the wholesale market. Therefore, the metering and&#13;
communications system has to be able to provide accurate and reliable acquisition and transmission of&#13;
the necessary data. A large number of meters and metering transformers as well as the appropriate&#13;
communications equipment will have to be replaced or installed anew.&#13;
2.13            The metering and communications component of the project involves purchasing and&#13;
installing the equipment needed to measure and record hourly active and reactive energy flows at market&#13;
delivery points -- the points where the sales transactions in the electricity market take place - and the also&#13;
the equipment needed to forward the necessary information for commercial settlements and accounting'.&#13;
Measurements should be made at: (i) 69 power plants substations (all power plants with a capacity of 20&#13;
MW or higher); (ii) about 120 transmission network substations; and (iii) about 100 interconnections&#13;
between the low voltage distribution companies (oblenergos). Meters in a particular location will be&#13;
connected to Local Data Acquisition Equipment, which will read and process meter readings, and transmit&#13;
data to Regional Data Acquisition Equipment located at the regional dispatch centers. In turn, the&#13;
Regional Data Acquisition Equipment will transmit the metered data to the Central Data Acquisition&#13;
Equipment located at the National Dispatch Center. The Central Data Acquisition Equipment will provide&#13;
the input to the Settlements System. In addition to meters and Data Acquisition Equipment, the metering&#13;
and communications system includes current and voltage transformers, communications equipment and&#13;
calibration equipment. Current and voltage transformers will be installed or upgraded only at selected&#13;
priority sites (major power plants and substations). Communications equipment includes cables for local&#13;
wiring at 289 sites, and telecommunication modems for transfer of data between the local, regional and&#13;
central sites. Calibration equipment consists of portable calibration sets which will be used for diagnostic&#13;
calibration of metering equipment (associated with the eight regional dispatch center and the National&#13;
Dispatch Center), and stationary calibration equipment for refurbishing and recertifying the metering&#13;
equipment.&#13;
3/     The metering and communications system will provide hourly readings of active and reactive energy consumption. Other data&#13;
necessary for commercial settlements in the market (system reserves, participation in the frequency control, etc.) will be provided&#13;
by other systems, such as SCADA, which will be installed under the Hydropower Rehabilitation and System Control Project (Ln.&#13;
3865-UA). A few components of the metering and communications system -- part of the Local Data Acquisition Equipment and the&#13;
meters for thermal plants, Local Data Acquisition Equipment for power transmission substations, Regional Data Acquisition&#13;
Equipment -- are included in EBRD's Power Market Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           19&#13;
2.14         The metering and communications system is critical for the commercial operation of the&#13;
electricity market. It will also enable better measurement, allocation and management of energy losses&#13;
in the generation and transmission system. The metering and communications system will create a&#13;
valuable data base which could be used to identify weak points in the transmission network, optimize&#13;
network operating regimes, and help in network development planning. It would also create conditions&#13;
for development of demand-side management strategies based on time-of-use pricing for end-consumers,&#13;
resulting in reduction of the peak load and a higher load factor for the system as a whole. When&#13;
connected to the SCADA system, the measurements could be used to improve real-time system operation&#13;
as well. It is difficult to separate benefits attributable to the metering and communications system alone,&#13;
since power system losses and load factors are affected by many other factors, like age and technical&#13;
condition of various components of the network (affecting system losses), structure of consumption and&#13;
the type of consumers connected to the network (affecting peak demand and load factors), etc. Therefore,&#13;
the performance and impact of the metering and communications component will be evaluated on the&#13;
basis of the "spillover" effect, i.e., the extent to which the end-use of electricity is subject to hourly&#13;
metering.&#13;
2.15         Technical services. This component includes both project implementation support and&#13;
institution building. Project implementation support will compensate for the limited experience of the&#13;
beneficiaries in international procurement and the management of foreign contractors. It will include:&#13;
(i)   fuel procurement: assisting the generation companies with the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation, fuel delivery management and stock maintenance;&#13;
(ii)   spare parts procurement: assisting the generation companies with the preparation of&#13;
bidding documents, bid evaluation, installation supervision, and stock maintenance; and&#13;
(iii)   metering and communications implementation support: assisting NDC with detailed&#13;
design, bidding documents preparation, bid evaluation, installation supervision, contract&#13;
management, and training in hardware utilization and applications of software.&#13;
Taking into account the extensive assistance that the four generation companies are expected to receive&#13;
in the areas of financial management and accounting under EBRD's Power Market Development Project,&#13;
the institutional building sub-component of the project will focus on NDC and on the next phase of the&#13;
reform process. It will include:&#13;
(iv)   operation of the wholesale market: assisting NDC with the operation of the hourly&#13;
bidding system, settlements administration, market funds administration, and general&#13;
strenghtening of financial management and accounting; and&#13;
(v)    privatization program: assisting Minenergo, the State Property Fund, and the enterprises&#13;
with the development of a program for the privatization of the thermal power generation&#13;
companies and the oblenergos. A core privatization adviser will work with Minenergo&#13;
and the State Property Fund, while separate teams will assist the companies. The task&#13;
will include the assessment of the pros and cons of various privatization methods,&#13;
development of a detailed privatization program, assistance in the areas of asset valuation,&#13;
and preparation of paperwork for the actual sale/distribution of shares.&#13;

C. Project Context&#13;
2.16         The components of the project were chosen to provide maximum support to the ongoing&#13;
reform program in the Ukrainian power industry. The proposed project is in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
energy strategy which aims at adapting energy utilities to the requirements of a market economy, and&#13;
improving energy efficiency by ensuring that proper price signals are sent to consumers (see Energy&#13;
Sector Review, Report No. 11646-UA). The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
discussed by the Executive Directors on June 27, 1996 (R96-120/1) that calls for the development of&#13;
competition by restructuring the public sector and establishing a regulatory environment that promotes&#13;
the role of the private sector. The Country Assistance Strategy also recommends that lending operations&#13;
in the energy sector should focus initially on the better utilization of existing assets. The authorities and&#13;
the power companies consider the working capital to be provided by the Bank loan essential for the&#13;
normal operation of the wholesale market during the first couple of years. By stabilizing the financial&#13;
situation of the power generation companies and NDC, the proposed project, together with the&#13;
corresponding reform measures, will also facilitate the future access of these companies to commercial&#13;
sources of credit. Finally, by improving the quality and reliability of electricity supply, a basic input for&#13;
production, the project will also facilitate Ukraine's industrial recovery.&#13;
2.17         The implementation of the project, particularly the sustained improvement of payment&#13;
collections, is expected to benefit from the Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan (Ln. 4057-UA) that&#13;
supports trade liberalization, privatization and enterprise restructuring, and the Standby Arrangement with&#13;
the IMF that supports macroeconomic stabilization and the strengthening of financial discipline in the&#13;
public sector. In order to ensure that power companies and other businesses will have improved access&#13;
to credit in the future, the Bank is working on a number of operations in the financial sector that will&#13;
strengthen Ukraine's banking system and increase its capacity to provide working capital. Specifically,&#13;
the planned Financial Institutions Development Loan is expected to provide credit lines and strenghten&#13;
a number of banks such as Prominvestbank that has traditionally been a source of credit for the power&#13;
industry. The planned Financial Sector Adjustment Loan will provide support to the banking sector in&#13;
a wide range of areas including prudential standards, accounting, creditors' rights, bankruptcy framework,&#13;
etc. The Electricity Market Development Project is expected to be followed by other Bank operations&#13;
in the power sector including the rehabilitation and upgrading of thermal power plants, and the&#13;
completion of additional peaking capacity on the Dniester river in order to improve system stability and&#13;
frequency control.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.18         The original design of the power plants requires coal with a calorific value 5,500 kcal/kg&#13;
and 18-24 percent ash content. Due to a number of reasons such as the lack of cash to pay for&#13;
internationally marketable coal, the power plants regularly burn coal of much lower quality. The low&#13;
quality of fuel decreases the efficiency of the plants, increases maintenance costs, and negatively affects&#13;
the environment. The high sulfur content of the coal (up to 2.5%) and mazut (up to 4%) is another cause&#13;
for concern. However, the trend of deteriorating fuel quality was more than balanced by a 50 percent&#13;
decline in electricity generation in thermal power plants between 1990 and 1995. The net effect was a&#13;
substantially reduced pollution load on the environment. Based on projected demand and the share of&#13;
electricity generated from fossil fuels, the output of the thermal power plants will not reach the 1990 level&#13;
before 2010.&#13;
2.19         The expected environmental impact of the first two components of the project --&#13;
environmental category "B" -- was reviewed during project preparation (other components were placed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              21&#13;
in category "C", not requiring environmental analysis). On the one hand, the project will slightly&#13;
increase the output of the thermal power plants by increasing their availability and practically eliminating&#13;
unserved demand compared to a "without project" scenario (see Section D in Chapter III on economic&#13;
analysis). On the other hand, the project will reduce emissions per unit of electricity generated as a result&#13;
of improvements in:&#13;
(i)    fuel quality: the coal to be purchased under the project will have 5,500 kcal/kg or higher&#13;
calorific value, 24 percent or lower ash content, and 1.0-1.5 percent or lower sulfur&#13;
content. The mazut to be purchased will have 9500 kcal/kg or higher calorific value and&#13;
1.1 percent or lower sulfur content;&#13;
(ii)   energy efficiency and dispatch: the repair of worn out equipment, the implementation&#13;
of the maintenance program of the plants, and the installation of data acquisition and&#13;
communication equipment to facilitate the energy dispatch from the plants will improve&#13;
the efficiency of electricity generation; and&#13;
(iii)   pollution control: the project will improve the efficiency of electrostatic precipitators and&#13;
include the implementation of an environmental monitoring program to assess the&#13;
concentration of dust, sulfur dioxyde and nitrogen oxydes in the flue gases emitted by the&#13;
thermal plants.&#13;
2.20          Assuming She above fuel specifications and the proper operation of pollution control and&#13;
monitoring equipment, a dispersion modeling exercise implemented jointly by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Minenergo confirmed that ambient air quality in the vicinity of the power plants will&#13;
meet the requirements established by the environmental authorities in Ukraine. The operation plans of&#13;
the generation companies (see Section H of Chapter IV) will include an environmental management and&#13;
monitoring plan to ensure that the expected reduction in emissions per unit of electricity generated&#13;
materialize and total emissions stay within acceptable limits.&#13;
E. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
2.21          Project Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 370.6 million equivalent.&#13;
Cost estimates are based on February 1996 prices. Physical contingencies were estimated at 5 percent&#13;
of base costs for the spare parts and metering components (no physical contingency was assumed for the&#13;
fuel and technical services components). Price contingencies were estimated at 5% for ex-border/ex-&#13;
factory costs of the first three components, and 5% for the local costs of the fuel component, 20% for&#13;
the local costs of the spare parts component, and 15% for the local costs of the metering component.&#13;
Assumptions on domestic inflation and exchange rate are given in Section C of Chapter III. The price&#13;
of coal was assumed to average US$ 28.0/t, ex mine or ex border, for the 5,500 kcal/kg product. It was&#13;
assumed that about half of the coal might come from imports and half from domestic mines. The&#13;
delivered coal price of US$ 35.2/t includes US$ 5.0/t for transportation and US$ 2.4/t for import duty.&#13;
The mazut price is based on US$ 75/t ex-refinery cost (assuming delivery before the winter) and US$&#13;
4/t for transportation (the 20% value-added tax applied to mazut is not included in the delivered mazut&#13;
price because it is reimbursable). A summary of the cost estimates is presented in Table 2.3. Detailed&#13;
cost estimates for each component can be found in Annex 4.&#13;

2.22            Project Financing. The proposed World Bank loan of US$ 317.0 million would cover&#13;
84 percent of project costs. The loan would finance (i) the ex-mine or ex-border cost of fuel; (ii) the net-&#13;
of-tax cost of spare parts and equipment for maintenance of the thermal power plants; (iii) the net-of-tax&#13;
cost of metering and communications equipment; and (iv) part of the technical services for the&#13;
implementation of the metering and communications component. The proposed loan would also include&#13;
financing of interest during construction for the metering and communications equipment (US$ 5.8&#13;
million). The loan would be provided to Ukraine for a period of 17 years (including a grace period of&#13;
five years) at the standard variable interest rate for LIBOR-based single currency loans. The Bank would&#13;
also charge a commitment fee of 0.75%  on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,&#13;
less any waiver (currently 2/3 of the commitment fee is waived). The Bank loan would be passed on to&#13;
the beneficiaries -- the four thermal power generation companies for the first two components and NDC&#13;
for the other components -- by the Government of Ukraine via subloan agreements. Dniproenergo would&#13;
receive US$ 65.4 million, Donbassenergo -- US$ 72.9 million, Tsentrenergo -- US$ 56.3 million,&#13;
Zakhidenergo -- US$ 50.8 million, and NDC -- US$ 71.6 million. The terms of the subloan agreements&#13;
will be IBRD interest rate plus a mark-up of 1 percent for loan administration with a maturity of 10&#13;
years, including three years grace period for Dniproenergo, Donbassenergo, Tsentrenergo and&#13;
Zakhidenergo, and a maturity of 17 years including five years grace period for NDC. The length of the&#13;
grace period is based on the time needed to implement the subprojects, and the shorter maturity for the&#13;
generation companies reflects the emphasis on financing working capital requirements. The foreign&#13;
exchange risk will be borne by the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will also reimburse the Government&#13;
for the commitment fee. The on-lending arrangements were confirmed during negotiations (para. 6.1 .a).&#13;
The signing of the subloan agreements would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.a).&#13;

The Project                                                                       23&#13;
2.23         The thermal power generation companies would provide from internally generated funds&#13;
US$ 40.6 million to cover (i) taxes and transportation costs for fuel purchases; and (ii) taxes and&#13;
installation costs for spare parts and equipment, and other costs of deferred maintenance. NDC will&#13;
provide from intemally generated funds US$ 14.6 million to cover (i) taxes and installation for the&#13;
metering and communications equipment; and (ii) part of the cost of implementation support.&#13;
2.24         Most of the technical services would be funded by bi- and multilateral donors.&#13;
Specifically, the United States Government would provide US$ 2.3 million to assist with fuel procurement&#13;
and the preparation of the generation companies and oblenergos for privatization; EBRD would provide&#13;
US$ 0.5 million to assist the generation companies with the procurement of spare parts; the Government&#13;
of Netherlands would provide US$ 1.0 million to assist NDC with the implementation of the metering&#13;
and communications component of the project; and United Kingdom Government would provide US$ 1.8&#13;
million to assist NDC with the operation of the wholesale market and to assist Minenergo and the State&#13;
Property Fund with the development of a privatization program for the thermal power generation&#13;
companies and the oblenergos. Financing arrangements are summarized in Table 2.4.&#13;

III. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Electricity Prices&#13;
3.1            Retail Prices. Historically, retail electricity prices were regulated by the Ministry of&#13;
Economy in Ukraine. Although the average nominal price of electricity increased almost 2,000 times&#13;
between 1991 and 1994, when expressed in a convertible currency, the price remained low (see Table&#13;
3.1). Significant real increases occured in 1995 and 1996, almost fully eliminating the gap between the&#13;
average price (UScent 3.9/kWh equivalent in August 1996) and the economic cost of electricity (estimated&#13;
at UScent 4.1/kWh)'. Stipulated prices cover the operating cost of the industry,2 and the difference&#13;
between the average price and the economic cost is partly due to discounts given to some of the&#13;
residential consumers (see below), and partly to the relatively low cost electricity produced by&#13;
hydropower plants.&#13;
Table 3.1 Average Electricity Prices, 1991-1996&#13;
1991       1992        1993       1994        1995       1996&#13;

3.2            The regulation of electricity prices is being taken over by the National Electricity&#13;
Regulatory Commission from the Ministry of Economy. As a temporary arrangement, retail electricity&#13;
prices are regulated jointly by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of&#13;
Economy in 1996. A new methodology for the calculation of retail electricity tariffs is incorporated in&#13;
the licences that have been recently issued to regulated suppliers by the National Electricity Regulatory&#13;
Commission (in addition to the 27 regulated tariff supply licences, NERC has also issued several non-&#13;
regulated supply licences, fostering competition for larger customers who have access to non-regulated&#13;
supply). Assuming that fuel prices remain stable during the second half of the year, the expected increase&#13;
in the average retail price will be moderate (about 15-20 percent in real terms) during 1996. Certain&#13;
categories of consumers, however, are expected to experience larger price increases. Even after taking&#13;
into account the recent price adjustment that has increased urban household electricity prices (for non-&#13;
privileged customers) above the level of industrial electricity prices, prices for other household categories&#13;
are still below economic cost due to the higher cost of providing electricity to small consumers (see Table&#13;
3.2). In order to ensure the rational use of electricity and improve industrial competitiveness, this&#13;
"hidden subsidy" should be phased out. During negotiations, the Bank agreed with the Government&#13;
delegation that the average price of electricity for households will be set at least 10 percent higher than&#13;
the average price paid by industrial consumers by the end of 1996, and at least 20 percent higher by the&#13;
end of 1997 (para. 6.1.b).&#13;
1/     The low economic cost (in international comparison) is explained by decreasing electricity demand resulting in surplus generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution capacity.&#13;
2/     Reported operating costs may not represent the true financial costs due to problems in the accounting system (see the section on&#13;
accounts in Chapter 4).&#13;

Including discounts given to privileged consumers (e.g., veterans, Chernobyl victims).  --&#13;
3.3             About one third of the residential consumers -- veterans, Chernobyl victims, militiamen,&#13;
etc. -- are entitled to substantial price discounts. These discounts impose a large financial burden on the&#13;
oblenergos (the total cost of the discounts to privileged households could be as high as US$ 200 million&#13;
on an annual basis), and create incentives for the uneconomic use of electricity. The Government is&#13;
planning to reduce the number of customers eligible for the discounts, and introduce a system of norms&#13;
(i.e., a life-line consumption levels) in order to limit the consumption of privileged customers. If&#13;
consumption above the norm is paid at the non-privileged price, the total cost of the discounts will be&#13;
reduced by US$ 100 million. The cost of the discounts would be funded through a surcharge on the&#13;
wholesale price (see below), and paid to the oblenergos according to the number of privileged consumers&#13;
they serve. During negotiations, the Bank agreed with the GOU delegation that consumption norms&#13;
limiting the amount of subsidized electricily will be introducedfor privileged consumers in 1996 (para.&#13;
6.1. c).&#13;
3.4             Wholesale Prices. Following the start of the "live" operations of the wholesale market&#13;
on April 10, 1996, the wholesale price of electricity is being set in every hour on the basis of bids&#13;
submitted by the generation companies. The first element of the wholesale price, the system marginal&#13;
price is equal to the bid received from the highest cost flexible generating unit that is still needed to meet&#13;
demand. The difference (called uplift or margin) between the system marginal price and the wholesale&#13;
price includes the following components: (i) payments to generators for capacity availability3, ancillary&#13;
services and electricity purchased under long term contracts; (ii) the operating expenses of NDC&#13;
(including debt service and funds for economically justified investments); and (iii) the high voltage&#13;
network fee. NERC has placed a temporary cap of US$ 40 per MWh on the bids of the generation&#13;
companies and suspended the capacity payment in order to avoid a sharp increase in wholesale prices due&#13;
to the limited competition among generators in a period characterized by fuel shortages (the cap will be&#13;
removed and the capacity payment restored after March 31, 1997).  "Uplift" also includes (iv)&#13;
provisioning for bad debt; (v) support to thermal generation companies to cover the difference between&#13;
3/      The capacity availability payment is provided on an hourly basis to all generators according to the number of MW the generators offer&#13;
to the system. The payment is zero when the balance between declared available capacity and demand is more than 2,000 MW. This&#13;
will be the usual situation in the Ukrainian power system over the next several years, unless there is an acute shortage of fuel or spare&#13;
parts. The capacity availability payment increases linearly from zero to US$ 50/MW as the capacity margin decreases to 1,000 MW,&#13;
and remains at this level afterwards.&#13;

3.5          Taking into account the above, a forecast of the wholesale price for the 1996-2001 period&#13;
is presented in Table 3.3. The forecast assumes, among other things, that (i) the average price paid to&#13;
thermal plants remains at the current level in 1996 (UScent 2.87/kWh), and increases by about 6% per&#13;
year afterwards; (ii) the average price paid for nuclear electricity increases to UScent 2.5/kWh in 1996,&#13;
and will be equal to the price paid to thermal plants afterwards (i.e., nuclear generators will fully&#13;
participate in the wholesale market); and (iii) bad debt provisioning amounts to 4% of revenues. Based&#13;
on these assumptions, the level of the average wholesale price in 1996 is expected to be UScent 3.1/kWh,&#13;
or 20 percent higher than the wholesale price that was established on January 1, 1996. Annual price&#13;
increases (in current US$) are expected to be in the range of 5 to 9 percent per year in the 1997-2001&#13;
period.&#13;
B. Past Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.6          Thermal Power Generation Companies. Since their establishment in July, 1995, all&#13;
four companies would have been able to generate reasonable net revenues if timely payments had always&#13;
been received. None of the companies has significant long term debt. Donbassenergo, Dniproenergo&#13;
and Tsentrenergo, however, were established with a difference of US$ 50.8 million, US$ 48.0 million,&#13;
US$ 28.5 million, respectively, between their account receivables and account payables, resulting in&#13;
severe cash flow pressure from the beginning. It was agreed during negotiations that these amounts will&#13;
be recovered via supplementary payments to be made by NDC to the generation companies over a period&#13;
of 3 years (para. 6.1.d).&#13;
3.7          Except Tsentrenergo, the companies had a formal current ratio greater than one in 1995.&#13;
Because a large share of receivables and payables were overdue, the calculated current ratios do not&#13;
present a meaningful liquidity measure. Actual collection ratios averaged only 70 to 86 percent in 1995&#13;
(see Table 3.4 in Section C below). Most electricity sales by the generation companies were bartered&#13;
for fuel deliveries, arranged through commercial agents (independent electricity suppliers) or directly with&#13;
fuel suppliers (see para. 3.16 for recent developments). Among the four companies, Dniproenergo had&#13;
the lowest production cost per kWh (UScent 1.99) and thus the highest profit margin (18%), while&#13;
Donbassenergo had the highest production cost per kWh (UScent 2.37) and lowest profit margin (10.6%).&#13;
Financial statements for the second half of 1995 can be found in Annex 5.&#13;
3.8           Dniproenergo has a combination of coal and gas plants, which gives it flexibility in its&#13;
choice of fuel mix. By relying on its relatively more efficient plants and using the highest share of coal&#13;
in its fuel mix, Dniproenergo achieved the lowest cost of production and therefore the highest profit&#13;
margin among the four companies. Donbassenergo has the second highest average age of plants (27.2&#13;
years), the lowest efficiency, and thus the highest production cost and lowest profit margin. Because of&#13;
its favorable position in supplying industries in the eastern parts of Ukraine, Donbassenergo received a&#13;
higher than average tariff during the third quarter of 1995.  However, as a precursor to the&#13;
implementation of the wholesale market, Donbassenergo started to receive the same tariff as the other&#13;
companies in the fourth quarter of 1995, resulting in a further reduction in its profit margin. To maintain&#13;
its market share in the future, Donbassenergo will need to upgrade its plants and increase efficiency to&#13;
control its production cost.&#13;
3.9          Tsentrenergo inherited a mix of plants with the lowest average age (24.7 years) and&#13;
reasonably high efficiency. However, due to the dispersed geographic location of its plants, Tsentrenergo&#13;
is experiencing difficulties in moving staff from the plants to its company headquarters. Zakhidenergo&#13;
is the smallest in generation capacity among the four companies. At the time of its establishment, it took&#13;
over two existing organizational structures, and combined them into one company. As a result, it has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
the highest non-fuel cost per kWh (about 30% above the average). The average age of its plants is the&#13;
highest (28 years), and the plants will require significant rehabilitation over the next 10 years. Currently,&#13;
the plants are operating at a comparatively high efficiency, which is attributed partly to the use of quality&#13;
coal imported from Poland. Because of the favourable location of one of its plants (Burshtynsk),&#13;
Zakhidenergo has been able to exploit export opportunities.&#13;
3.10           National Dispatch Center.4 During the first half of 1995, NDC purchased the output&#13;
of nuclear and hydropower plants and resold it to Ukraine's eight vertically integrated regional utilities&#13;
(through the regional dispatch centers). In the second half of 1995, NDC became the main purchaser of&#13;
output from Ukraine's thermal, nuclear and hydro plants, dispatching nuclear on a must-run basis and&#13;
thermal plant on merit order. In July 1995, the regional dispatch centers were merged with NDC;&#13;
subsequently NDC resold electricity directly to the oblenergos which distribute and supply electricity to&#13;
final consumers. Independent suppliers also carried out a similar trading function; their electricity&#13;
purchases and sales were registered by NDC in "offset" arrangements. In addition to dispatching&#13;
electricity, NDC is also responsible for the payment to the high voltage transmission company for its&#13;
services.&#13;
3.11           In mid-1995, NDC started the process of becoming the administrator of the wholesale&#13;
electricity market. As a result, NDC has large revenue and expenditure flows relative to its own&#13;
operating costs. Revenues in the second half of 1995 were based on bulk supply tariffs for each&#13;
oblenergo set by Minenergo and the National Electricity Regulatory Commission. The cost of power&#13;
purchased from the generation companies was also set by these agencies. NDC's gross margin in 1995&#13;
was approximately Krb 27.8 trillion, or about 6% of total revenue. After subtracting operating costs,&#13;
interest and tax, NDC had a profit of Krb 4.57 billion in 1995. Non-income taxes (road, innovation,&#13;
labor security) of Krb 7.2 trillion were assessed as a fixed percentage of the revenues, inconsistently with&#13;
NDC's new role as the administrator of the wholesale market. The generation companies and oblenergos&#13;
also pay the same taxes creating a cascading effect. It was agreed during negotiations that the cascading&#13;
effect currently applicable to the obligatory contributions payable into the road fund, innovation fund and&#13;
labor protection fund by generation companies, oblenergos and NDC would be eliminated by January 1,&#13;
1997 (para. 6.1.e).&#13;
3.12           NDC's financial performance is dominated by a severe cashflow  problem.  The&#13;
provisional figures show that receivables from oblenergos amounted to Krb 231.7 trillion (US$ 1.25&#13;
billion equivalent) on December 31, 1995, indicating an average collection period of nearly 178 days.&#13;
This is substantially worse than at the end of 1994, when the average age of receivables was about 60&#13;
days (however, the stock of receivables represents not more than about 90 days of current sales). NDC's&#13;
accumulated payables to generation companies were Krb 220.9 trillion (US$ 1.19 billion) on December&#13;
31, 1995. It should be noted, however, that the stock of payables and receivables includes about Krb 95&#13;
trillion as a result of unpaid electricity sales in the first half of 1995 that took place without the&#13;
involvement of NDC. These incomplete transactions were transferred to NDC's accounts in line with&#13;
its new role of administering the electricity market. In addition, payables and receivables also include&#13;
transactions that were completed (from NDC's point of view) but have not been posted yet. An example&#13;
is a transaction arranged by an independent suppliers who provided fuel to a generation company and took&#13;
responsibility for collecting directly from the end-users of electricity. NDC recorded this transactions&#13;
4/     Indicative fuiancial figures for NDC for the year ended 1995 are shown in Annex 5. These are based on provisional figures obtained&#13;
from NDC who is in the process of consolidating the annual financial statements of its regional subsidiaries. Remaining uncertainties&#13;
are related to the finalization of the accounts payable and receivable values; profit and loss line items; and the reconciliation of the&#13;
Income Statement with the Balance Sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial and Economic Analysis                                                       29&#13;
as between itself and the generation company (as a payable), and between itself and the oblenergo (as a&#13;
receivable). After the independent supplier collects payment from the final consumer, the collected&#13;
amount is posted and the book entries offset each other. Due to the above factors, the stock of&#13;
receivables gives a misleading picture of NDC's collection performance in 1995. In the future,&#13;
independent suppliers will be licenced, and NDC will introduce new settlements and market funds&#13;
administration procedures (see para. 4.5). Under these new procedures, the above "offsets" will be&#13;
completed within the normal collection cycle.&#13;
C. Future Financial Performance of the Implementing Agencies&#13;
3.13         Financial projections were prepared for all four generation companies and NDC for the&#13;
1996 to 2001 period. Summary projections are presented in Annex 5, and detailed projections in Annex&#13;
6. The main assumptions were:&#13;
-     the general rate of annual inflation in Ukraine will be 48% in 1996, 20% in 1997, 12%&#13;
in 1998, 10% in 1999, 9% in 2000 and 8% in 2001;&#13;
-     the Krb/US$ exchange rate will be 180,000 in 1996-2001;&#13;
-     electricity demand will follow the medium scenario (see Annex 1);&#13;
-     the output (after deducting own consumption) of the hydropower plants will be 10&#13;
TWh/year throughout the whole period;&#13;
-     the output of the nuclear plants will be 70.7 TWh in 1996 and 74.4 TWh/year&#13;
afterwards;&#13;
-     the price of electricity produced by nuclear plants will be US$ 0.025/kWh in 1996, and&#13;
will be equal to the price of electricity produced by thermal plants afterwards;&#13;
-     electricity produced by all four generation companies will be sold at the same average&#13;
price (see Table 3.3); and&#13;
-     coal prices will be US$ 35/t, gas US$ 85/tcm and mazut US$ 80/t in 1996, increasing&#13;
to US$ 38.6/t, US$ 107.9/tcm and US$ 102.3/t, respectively, by the end of the period.&#13;
3.14         Thermal Power Generation Companies. In 1997, thermal generation companies are&#13;
expected to sell somewhat less electricity than in 1996 due to increased nuclear output while demand is&#13;
flat. This reduction of revenues is expected to make substantial impact on the profit margin of each&#13;
company, especially for Donbassenergo and Zakhidenergo where non-fuel costs were particularly high.&#13;
With the relatively low efficiency of its plants and high administrative cost, Donbassenergo is expected&#13;
to generate a profit margin of only 4%, if the expenses on social program is kept at minimal in 1997.&#13;
The other three companies will register a modest profit. As overall electricity demand increases and the&#13;
output of nuclear and hydropower plants remains constant, electricity sales by thermal generation&#13;
companies will increase and their ability to cover fixed costs will improve.&#13;
3.15         In the short run, cash flow remains to be the main concern for all four companies.&#13;
Unable to collect their receivables in a timely fashion, the companies have delayed payments to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                               Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
suppliers. As a result, there is a constant shortage of fuel and delays of maintenance in the plants, which&#13;
has led to sub-optimal dispatch and production, and sometimes raise concerns of safety. To address the&#13;
non-collectables from NDC, and the delays of payments to suppliers, the generation companies have&#13;
started to reschedule their accumulated receivables and payables (as of July 1, 1996) with each debtor and&#13;
creditor for a repayment period of 3 years. The rescheduling of receivables has already been completed.&#13;
The rescheduling of ninety percent of the payables would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para.&#13;
6.2.b).&#13;
3.16          Recently, the companies have achieved significant increases in their collection ratios&#13;
(during the month of August 1996, for example, all four generation companies reported a collection ratio&#13;
of 90% or higher). The share of cash collections also improved, surpassing 20% in July and August.&#13;
The rules embedded in licences and market agreements will ensure that these trends continue (see paras.&#13;
2.3 and 3.19). As a result, payables and receivables, following the above rescheduling, are expected to&#13;
remain within reasonable bounds. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the payables and&#13;
receivables of generation companies would not exceed 40 days in 1996, 35 days in 1997, and 30 days&#13;
thereafter (para. 6.1.f).&#13;
3.17          A factor that contributed to the insufficient working capital in the past was the use of&#13;
excess cash. During the course of the fiscal year, company management and the labor unions review the&#13;
cash position in the company, and decide about the allocation of "excess" cash (which is viewed as profit)&#13;
to various staff bonuses, incentives, benefits and social programs (e.g., construction and/or maintenance&#13;
of a staff recreation center, purchase of a produce farm, establishment of a kindergarten). Depending&#13;
on the cash flow situation, these expenses could amount to two to three times of wage costs, and are not&#13;
tax-deductible. Unless these expenses are controlled, the companies will continue facing the difficulty&#13;
of working capital shortage, and in the long run, this will prevent the companies from a healthy growth.&#13;
The strenghtening of corporate governance under the reform program, and the improvement of financial&#13;
management supported by EBRD's Power Market Development Project are expected to change these&#13;
practices. It was agreed during negotiations that the companies would maintain adequate working capital&#13;
to cover fuel stocks at 14 thermal power generating plants at the following minimal levels, starting&#13;
January 1, 1997:&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the first quarter of a year,&#13;
-      20 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the second quarter of a year;&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the third quarter of a year;&#13;
-      40 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the fourth quarter of a year.&#13;
In addition, agreement was reached during negotiations that the generation companies would maintain&#13;
a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 during the term of the Bank loan (paras. 6.1.g, 6.1.h).&#13;
3.18          National Dispatch Center. The financial projections prepared for NDC (see Annex 5)&#13;
assume that NDC'c operating costs and electricity purchase and resale prices would follow the scenario&#13;
presented in Table 3.3 above. In addition, it was assumed that NDC would pay off its overdue payables&#13;
to the generation companies over a period of three years. It was also assumed that NDC would collect&#13;
its receivables from the oblenergos over the same period, and there would be a match between the inflow&#13;
5/     The winter consumption of the fuels is defined as the expected average daily consumption during the 4th quarter of the year. If&#13;
the specified levels of mazut reserves exceed the storage capacity, then the minimal inventory level for mazut in such cases is&#13;
defined as 75% of the available storage capacity. The specified minimal levels for each quarter will be reached for at least 10&#13;
days in each respective quarter.&#13;

and outflow of cash. NDC would be allowed to include bad debt provisioning in the wholesale price in&#13;
order to accumulate sufficient cash reserves that may be needed to cover uncollectables. During&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that (i) NDC's payables and receivables would not exceed 40 days in 1996,&#13;
35 days in 1997, and 30 days thereafter; and (ii) NDC would maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.5&#13;
during the term of the Bank loan (paras. 6.1.f, 6.1.h).&#13;
3.19         All oblenergos have signed the Energomarket Members Agreement (EMA) that introduces&#13;
the policy of suspending or proportionally reducing electricity sales to oblenergos (and other suppliers)&#13;
that fail to pay fully for their electricity purchases. In order to ensure that the performance of oblenergos&#13;
in payment collection improves, the oblenergos have been also asked to sign a Collection Agreement with&#13;
NDC that specifies a set of procedures that the oblenergo shuld use to deal with delinquent customers,&#13;
the method of provisioning for bad debt in the retail price, and a schedule for the payment of accumulated&#13;
arrears over a three-year period (see Annex 6). These agreements have been approved by the National&#13;
Electricity Regulatory Commission. Signing of the Collection Agreement by at least 23 oblenergos would&#13;
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2.c). During negotiations, it was agreed that GOU would&#13;
take all steps necessary and appropriate to ensure the compliance of oblenergos and NDC with the EMA&#13;
and the Collection Agreement during the term of the Bank loan (para. 6.1. i).&#13;
D. Economic Costs and Benefits&#13;
3.20         For each company and the total project, an economic evaluation was performed for the&#13;
physical components for which benefit estimates were made. The summary results are shown in Table&#13;
3.4. Details of the analysis are presented in Annex 7. All costs are expressed in 1995 constant economic&#13;
prices, net of taxes and subsidies. The social discount rate assumed for the economic analysis is 10%.&#13;
The evaluation period is 1996-2005.&#13;

3.21         Fuel Inventory Buildup. An increase in plant availability during winter peak load was&#13;
quantified as the main benefit conferred by this component. Compared to a "without project" scenario,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                          Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
a total of 1,420 MW additional generating capacity was assumed to go on line as a result of maintaining&#13;
fuel inventories at an average of 40-day supplies in critical winter months (six hours per day 120 days&#13;
per year). The availability gain was conservatively valued at US$ 0.05/kWh, based on the planned&#13;
availability payment to generators when the capacity margin is less than 1,000 MW or negative on the&#13;
wholesale market (see Section A above). The estimated EIRRs are in the range of 23 % to 51 %.&#13;
3.22         Spare Parts and Urgent Maintenance. The quantified benefits include: (i) an increase&#13;
in the fuel efficiency of the plants ranging from 0.9% to 1.2% (calculated as a reduction in fuel use&#13;
compared to the "without project" scenario); and (ii) an increase in plant availability (gains vary between&#13;
0.4% and 0.7% of electricity generationby company). The availability gains were valued at the expected&#13;
availability payments (US$ 0.05/kWh); the fuel efficiency gains reflect the economic cost of fuel. The&#13;
estimated EIRRs range from 29% to 33%.&#13;
3.23         Metering and Telecommunications. The quantifiable benefits of this component derive&#13;
mainly from the installation of meters that allow the introduction of time-of-use pricing for large&#13;
industrial consumers with an aggregate load of 32 TWh per year. The time-of-use pricing would provide&#13;
these customers with incentives and penalties to shift electricity usage away from the higher cost peak&#13;
periods. This shift would entail an improvement in the system load factor. Taking into account&#13;
adjustment costs on the consumer side, the net gain from cost-minimizing load-shifting was conservatively&#13;
estimated at 2.5 % of the cost of 32 TWh of electricity (the electricity was valued at the projected system&#13;
marginal price). The EIRR of this component is estimated at 26%.&#13;
3.24         Total Project. The Net Present Value and the EIRR were estimated for the entire project&#13;
at US$ 299 million and 35%, respectively. The quantitative benefits are regarded as a conservative&#13;
measure of the true economic benefit. Other non-quantified benefits include: (i) reduction of emissions&#13;
per unit of electricity generated due to the installation of environmental impact mitigation and monitoring&#13;
equipment; (ii) enhanced power system stability due to decreases in unplanned outages; (iii) reduced&#13;
energy losses due to improved allocation of energy flows; and (iv) consumer surplus associated with&#13;
incremental electricity sales.&#13;

Financial and Economic Analysis                                                                            33&#13;
E. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
3.25            Calculations were carried out to test the robustness of the economic viability (proxied by&#13;
the EIRR) of the individual components and the whole project to variations in key parameters. Switching&#13;
values (at which the NPV is zero and the EIRR is 10%) were also calculated (see Table 3.5). These&#13;
results show that the project's EIRR is quite robust under all scenarios, including the low-probability&#13;
worst-case incorporating a simultaneous deterioration of all parameters. Among the individual project&#13;
components only the metering and conmmunications component's EIRR shows relatively significant&#13;
sensitivity to a sizable concurrent worsening in key parameters. It should be noted, however, that the&#13;
base case EIRR was rather conservatively estimated for this component.&#13;

IV. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
4.1           Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiaries, i.e., the four&#13;
joint stock generation companies - Dniproenergo, Donbassenergo, Tsentrenergo and Zakhidenergo -&#13;
and the National Dispatch Center. The generation companies were established in July 1995. The&#13;
fourteen thermal plants under the generation companies maintained their role in day-to-day management,&#13;
commercial functions such as financial management, accounting, contract negotiations, etc. are being&#13;
transferred to the newly established headquarters of each company. In 1995, significant changes took&#13;
place in NDC as well. The eight regional dispatch centers were removed from the regional utilities, and&#13;
were consolidated under NDC in June 1995. Although it is expected to remain a state owned enterprise,&#13;
the role of NDC has changed significantly when it received the licence to operate the wholesale market.&#13;
4.2           Thermal Generation Companies. The four thermal generation companies are based on&#13;
Ukraine's 14 largest fossil-fuel power plants (installed capacity of 500 MW and higher) and, with the&#13;
exception of Tsentrenergo, are regionally based. Zakhidenergo consists of the Ladyzhynsk, Burshtynsk,&#13;
and Dobrotvirsk stations, all located in Western Ukraine; Dniproenergo consists of the Zaporozhye,&#13;
Pridniprovsk, and Krivoy Rog Stations, located in the industrial belt in South Central Ukraine;&#13;
Donbassenergo owns the Starobeshevo, Kurakhovsk, Slaviansk, Zuiv, and Lugansk stations in Eastern&#13;
Ukraine; and Tsentrenergo owns the Tripolye (south of Kiev), Zmiev (near Kharkhiv), and Uglegorsk&#13;
(Eastern Ukraine) stations.&#13;
4.3           The generation companies have not only centralized the commercial functions of the&#13;
individual thermal power enterprises, but also assumed certain new functions. One of them, investment&#13;
planning, has previously rested with Minenergo. Although the Ministry retained a strategic planning&#13;
function, each company is in the process of establishing independent investment planning capability.&#13;
Individual power plants have similar organizational structures. The Chief Engineer, Deputy Director for&#13;
Capital Investments (in some cases only a Senior Engineer for Capital Investments), Deputy Director for&#13;
Support Services and Production, and the managers of the departments for economic analysis, accounting,&#13;
and personnel report directly to the Station Director. The Chief Engineer is in charge of all technical&#13;
activities related to the operation of the plant, and typically supervises production and dispatch, technical&#13;
and operational divisions, and turbine, thermal electrical, and electrical shops. "Support services and&#13;
production" includes the procurement division, transport and security, and often involve some activities&#13;
not directly related to the main business operation, but to the provision of social services (e.g., day-care&#13;
centers) or other production activities (e.g., agricultural production).6  Power plants are moving&#13;
(somewhat slowly) to headquarters their staff performing functions that are now assigned to the corporate&#13;
level such as financial management, accounting, fuel procurement.&#13;
4.4           National Dispatch Center. NDC has about 430 employees in the center, and 4,000&#13;
employees in the eight regional dispatch centers. NDC is managed by a Director, a first Deputy Director&#13;
and six Deputy Directors. The main departments reporting to the Director and Deputy Directors are&#13;
Dispatch, Optimization of Energy Regimes, Optimization of Network Regimes, Relay Protection and&#13;
Automation, Electricity Consumption Management and Supervision, Communications, Computer&#13;
Services, Accounting, Finance, Labor, Maintenance, and Support Services. The National Dispatch&#13;
6/     About 150 joint stock companies were formed by separating non-core activities from the generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
enterprises in 1995. About 60 of these companies have already been privatized. It is expected that the process of separating and&#13;
privatizing non-core activities will continue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation                                                                        35&#13;
Center is being strenghtened as the agency that will operate the wholesale market. NDC's main functions&#13;
will include: (i) the control and financing of the high voltage grid; (ii) the purchase and dispatch of power&#13;
capacity and electricity; (iii) the purchase of ancillary system services; and (iv) the administration of the&#13;
settlements system, including the administration of market funds (creating payment orders and clearing&#13;
payments. A new Energomarket Department was established under the First Deputy Director in October&#13;
1995. It consists of the following divisions: Supervision of Regional Dispatch Centers, Energomarket&#13;
Operations, Settlements, Market Funds Administration, Production and Economic Services, Labor and&#13;
Social Issues.&#13;
4.5          The Settlements and Market Funds Administration Divisions, however, operated with a&#13;
skeleton staff until September 1996. Although a computerized program for the bidding process and a set&#13;
of new banking and accounting procedures/records to administer market funds were developed by the end&#13;
of 1995 (NDC was assisted in that process by the UK Know How Fund), NDC did not prepare a staffing&#13;
plan and start the recruitment of staff necessary for the implementation of these procedures until mid-&#13;
1996. The lack of qualified staff caused problems in the daily reporting of the results of the bidding&#13;
process, recording of payment obligations, and administration of payments. The filling of all planned&#13;
positions with qualified staff have been completed only recently.&#13;
B. Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
4.6          A Project Coordinator have been appointed by Minenergo to manage project processing&#13;
activities and coordinate technical services, scheduling, procurement activities, reporting, training, and&#13;
other aspects of project preparation/implementation requiring coordination between the four generation&#13;
companies and the National Dispatch Center. The Project Coordinator will also be responsible for&#13;
processing the loan within the Ukrainian government and assuring that the domestic paperwork is&#13;
prepared and approved in a timely manner.&#13;
4.7          Project Implementation Units (PIUs) have been established at the four generation&#13;
companies and NDC with responsibilities to manage project preparation and implementation. PIU&#13;
personnel will be drawn from company staff presently engaged in the following activities: managing the&#13;
engineering aspects of project preparation/implementation, including finalization of project technical&#13;
design, preparation of bid-level design specifications, supervision and approval of manufacturers' detailed&#13;
design, inspection of manufacturers' facilities, quality control, factory and field acceptance tests,&#13;
scheduling, procurement (including bidding and contracting), payments and disbursement operations&#13;
related to the respective project components. They will be assisted by consultants experienced in Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures and guidelines, as stated in para. 4.10.&#13;
4.8          Site managers will be appointed at each site where project subcomponents are to be&#13;
implemented. The site managers, appointed by the managers of the respective facilities, will serve as&#13;
liaisons between management of the facilities and the corresponding PIUs. They will participate in&#13;
monthly review meetings with the PIUs, attended by concerned project staff, to review progress, address&#13;
implementation issues and authorize payments to suppliers and contractors. Site implementation will be&#13;
handled within the existing organizational structure of the concerned facilities.&#13;
4.9          The procurement of fuel and the installation of spare parts will be the responsibility of&#13;
the respective facilities (generation companies and thermal plants). The plants will use their force account&#13;
and specialized local construction and installation companies, under the guidance of the supplier where&#13;
necessary (e.g., for major repairs, which will be specified in the tender documents). NDC will have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                         Implementation&#13;
necessary (e.g., for major repairs, which will be specified in the tender documents). NDC will have&#13;
overall responsibility for the implementation of the metering and communications component. For the&#13;
metering equipment that will be installed in the power plants and the high and low voltage networks,&#13;
installation and maintenance agreements will be signed between NDC and the companies that own the&#13;
plants and the networks. The installation and maintenance agreements will clarify the responsibilities of&#13;
each party. Force accounts and local subcontractors, financed by NDC, will be used to install and&#13;
commission the equipment under the guidance of the suppliers. The suppliers will supervise the&#13;
installation and commissioning, and provide the necessary training. Each company will be responsible&#13;
for maintaining the equipment located in its area. A sample installation and maintenance agreement&#13;
between NDC and a generation company was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. The installation&#13;
and maintenance agreements between NDC and the generation companies, the transmission company, and&#13;
the oblenergos will be signed not later than the end of 1996 (para. 6.1.j).&#13;
4.10         The four generation companies and NDC will be assisted by consultants during the&#13;
implementation of the project. The consultants, funded mostly by multi- and bilateral donors, will work&#13;
in conjunction with the staff of the companies (and domestic consultants in the case of NDC) assigned&#13;
to the project. NDC will receive assistance with the operation of the wholesale market and the&#13;
strenghtening of its financial management and accounting. Financial management and accounting support&#13;
will be provided to the generation companies under EBRD's Power Market Development Project.&#13;
Additional assistance in the area of institutional strengthening will be provided to the generation&#13;
companies during the preparation of the privatization program, coordinated by Minenergo's Department&#13;
of Corporatization and Privatization.&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.11         The project will be implemented over a period of three years, and is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 1999. A detailed implementation schedule is presented in Annex 8. The purchase&#13;
and delivery of fuel is expected to be completed before the end of 1996. About 50% of the spare parts&#13;
and equipment for the thermal power plants will be purchased and installed in the first year of&#13;
implementation, 40% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. The metering and communications&#13;
component will be implemented in three phases over the 1996-1999 period:&#13;
(i)    Phase 1, to be implemented by mid-1997, will include (but not necessarily be limited to)&#13;
the establishment of metering standards and procedures; detailed assessment of individual&#13;
site requirements; prioritization of work; preparation of technical specifications, as well&#13;
as detailed engineering design necessary to produce bid documents; issuing of bid&#13;
documents; contract negotiations and signing.&#13;
(ii)   Phase 2, to be implemented in 1997-1998, will include the following:&#13;
Installation of metering equipment (meters, current and voltage transformers) at&#13;
the priority sites, identified during the first phase. The priority sites will include&#13;
major thermal plants, transmission network substations, and possibly other sites&#13;
as well;&#13;
Installation of local, regional and central data acquisition systems;&#13;
Installation of communications equipment; and&#13;
Installation of calibration equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation                                                                       37&#13;
(iii)   Phase 3, to be implemented in 1998-1999, will include the installation of metering&#13;
equipment (meters, current and voltage transformers) at the remaining sites.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
4.12         Project components, their estimated cost, and proposed methods of procurement are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1. Equipment and goods financed from the Bank loan will be procured according&#13;
to the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loan and IDA Credits (1995). Contracts for&#13;
equipment and goods estimated to cost more than US$ 300,000 will be procured through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. Specifically, all fuel will be&#13;
procured under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. About 78 percent of the spare parts&#13;
and equipment for maintenance of the power plants will be procured under ICB, about 4 percent under&#13;
international shopping when off-the-shelf equipment or standard specification commodities that are small&#13;
in value are available, and 18 percent by direct purchase when standardization of spare parts justifies&#13;
additional purchases from the original supplier in order to be compatible with existing equipment. About&#13;
98 percent of the metering and communications component will be procured under ICB. National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) was not considered to be suitable for non-ICB procurement.  The&#13;
procurement under ICB procedures will include (i) 8 packages for fuel, ranging from US$ 7.6 million&#13;
to US$ 31.0 million with a total aggregate value of US$ 123.1 million; (ii) 9 packages of equipment for&#13;
the thermal power plants, ranging from US$ 2.2 million to US$ 18.4 million, with a total aggregate value&#13;
of US$ 96.1 million; and (iii) 11 packages of metering and communications equipment, ranging from US$&#13;
0.6 million to US$ 20.2 million with a total aggregate value of US$ 62.4 million.&#13;
4.13         Domestic manufacturers competing under ICB for the spare parts/equipment and metering&#13;
and communications components of the project will be eligible for a 15 percent preference, or the&#13;
prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers (whichever is lower), provided that they can&#13;
prove that (i) labor, raw material and components from within the country of the Borrower will account&#13;
for more than 30 percent of the ex-works, ex-factory or off-the-shelf price of the product offered; and&#13;
(ii) the production facility in which those goods will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in&#13;
manufacturing/assembling such goods at least since the time of bid submission. Domestic preference will&#13;
not be applicable to the fuel component of the project. Consultants, to be financed under the technical&#13;
services component of the loan if bilateral funds are not available, will be selected according to the&#13;
Bank's Guidelinesfor Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981). The list of procurement packages and the schedule of procurement activities are&#13;
provided in Annex 9.&#13;
4.14         With the exception of NDC (one of the beneficiaries of the Hydropower Rehabilitation&#13;
and System Control Project), implementing agencies in Ukraine have limited knowledge of international&#13;
commercial practices and the Bank's procurement procedures. Procurement teams will be established&#13;
within the Project Implementation Units, and will receive training during the early stages of project&#13;
implementation, both from the Bank and from the consultants engaged under the technical services&#13;
component. To ensure compliance with the Bank guidelines, the following documents will be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank: draft tender documents, bid evaluation reports and recommendations for awards&#13;
of contracts, for all ICB procurement (US$300,000 and above) and all Bank-financed contracts awarded&#13;
under direct contracting/negotiation; list of goods to be purchased through international shopping financed&#13;
by the Bank; terms of reference for all consulting contracts; all consulting contracts financed by the Bank&#13;
above US$100,000 for firms, and above US$50,000 for individual consultants. All other contracts will&#13;
be subject to ex-post review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                                                 Implementation&#13;
4.15             A General Procurement Notice is planned to be published in the Development Business&#13;
Forum and in a major local newspaper in September 1996. The General Procurement Notice will be&#13;
updated and published annually. Individual bidding opportunities will be advertised in a major local&#13;
newspaper. Tenders with an estimated value of US$ 10 million or more will also be advertised in the&#13;
Development Business Forum. In addition, the project agencies would be expected to advise known&#13;
eligible and qualified traditional suppliers directly.&#13;

4.16          Procurement information will be collected by the Project Coordinator and reported to the&#13;
Bank as follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of contract award information;&#13;
(b)    semiannual and annual reports that include:&#13;
revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best&#13;
estimates of allowances for physical and price contingency;&#13;
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
*     compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
4.17          The United States Government financed a workshop for the generation companies in&#13;
August that included a discussion of Bank procurement rules in relation to the purchase of fuel under the&#13;
project. Additional workshops will be organized to assist the generation companies with the purchase&#13;
of spare parts. NDC, one of the beneficiaries under the Hydropower Rehabilitation and System Control&#13;
Project (Ln. 3865-UA), is already familiar with Bank procurement procedures.&#13;
4.18         The Government is expected to prepare legislation instituting public procurement rules&#13;
and regulations as part of the program to transform the economy from a centrally planned to a market-&#13;
oriented system based on the development of a competitive private sector. The Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Report is expected to be prepared after legislation has been enacted and placed in effect.&#13;
E. Disbursement&#13;
4.19          The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed over a three year period on the following&#13;
basis:&#13;
(a)    100 percent of foreign and ex-mine cost of fuel (US$ 123.1 million);&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign and ex-factory cost of spare parts and equipment for maintenance&#13;
of the thermal power plants, and 80 percent of local costs for items procured locally&#13;
(US$ 122.3 million);&#13;
(c)    100 percent of foreign and ex-factory cost of metering and communications equipment,&#13;
and 80 percent of local costs for items procured locally (US$ 63.8 million); and&#13;
(d)    100 percent of expenditures for consultancy services (US$ 2.0 million).&#13;
The loan will be disbursed in two parallel tranches with the same terms and conditions. Components (a)&#13;
and (b) will be included in the first tranche, components (c) and (d) in the second tranche. Under the&#13;
second tranche, an additional US$ 5.8 million will be disbursed to finance interest during construction&#13;
(including the commitment fee) for the metering and communications and technical services components.&#13;

4.21         Disbursement for goods under contracts not exceeding US$300,000 equivalent, consulting&#13;
firms under contracts not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, and individual consultants not exceeding&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent would be made against statement of expenditures (SOE) in order to assist the&#13;
beneficiaries in making timely payments. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not&#13;
be sent to the Bank, but would be retained by the PIUs for inspection by supervision missions and by&#13;
external auditors. All other disbursements would be fully documented. The minimum size of the&#13;
applications for direct payments will be US$50,000.&#13;
4.22         To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish five (5) Special Accounts&#13;
(one for each thermal generation company and one for the National Dispatch Center) in commercial&#13;
bank(s) on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The&#13;
authorized allocation to each Special Account would be US$ 1 million, representing about 4 months of&#13;
average expenditures effected through the Special Accounts. At the request of the Borrower and, based&#13;
on project needs, the Bank would make initial deposits into each Special Accounts up to US$300,000&#13;
equivalent, until about 20% of the loan allocation for the corresponding component is disbursed.&#13;
Thereafter, deposit to the Special Account of the corresponding component can increase up to US$1&#13;
million. Applications for the replenishment of the Special Accounts would be submitted monthly or when&#13;
one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for&#13;
replenishment would follow the usual Bank procedures. In addition, monthly bank statements of the&#13;
Special Accounts which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment&#13;
applications. Arrangements for the establishment, operation, and auditing of the Special Accounts were&#13;
agreed during negotiations (see para. 4.24). Translated versions of the World Bank's Disbursement&#13;
Handbook (Washington, DC 1992) have been distributed to all the Project Implementation Units.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.23         Ukraine's electricity enterprises follow standard Soviet accounting procedures, which have&#13;
been augmented as required by the admninistrative reporting requirements of the many government bodies&#13;
to which they report. The financial accounting standard now in use is not adequate for providing reliable&#13;
management and regulatory reports. Revenues are reported on a cash basis, when received, and costs&#13;
associated with producing revenue are not booked until such time as revenues arrive. When accounts&#13;
receivable are not being collected, a substantial portion of costs are held off the books, misstating income.&#13;
A related problem is that neither of the beneficiaries is equipped to track its receivables and payables on&#13;
a dated basis, and thus there is no basis for calculating and recognizing inflationary losses. At present,&#13;
there is no recognition of uncollectible debt. In addition to maintaining the statutory accounts required&#13;
by Ukrainian law, the beneficiaries will maintain a parallel system of financial statements (income&#13;
statements, sources and uses of funds, and balance sheets) that meet international accounting standards&#13;
(IAS) starting in 1997. The IAS accounts will supply data inputs suitable for use in tariff calculations&#13;
and regulatory reporting that will be required by the National Energy Regulatory Commission. They also&#13;
will serve as the basis for calculating interest penalties to be provided for under their new contracts, and&#13;
for monitoring progress in improving the timeliness of payments and collections. Financial statements&#13;
will be audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank and the audit reports submitted to the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of each financial year (para. 6.1.k).&#13;
4.24         The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related&#13;
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial&#13;
statements of IBRD-financed components will be prepared and audited in accordance with International&#13;
Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                           Implementation&#13;
IBRD within six months of the close of the GOU fiscal year. Audits will also be carried out, at the same&#13;
time, and for corresponding periods in accordance with the Bank guidelines, for SOEs against which&#13;
disbursements have been made or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference&#13;
to the Special Account and SOEs will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
During negotiations, it was agreed that the implementing agencies would submit to the Bank the audit&#13;
reports and audited financial statements for the Special Account, project accounts and SOEs for every&#13;
fiscal year, not later than six months after the close of such year. Auditors acceptable to the Bank would&#13;
be retained to review the accounting systems and supporting internal procedures and practices for the&#13;
Special and Project Accounts and SOEs, and recommend any needed changes (paras. 6.1. k, 6.1.1).&#13;
G. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.25          The Project Coordination Unit will prepare semiannual and annual project progress&#13;
reports. The progress reports, following clearance by the Borrower, will be submitted to the Bank. The&#13;
progress reports will include, but not necessarily be limited to, project physical progress, procurement,&#13;
disbursements, project costs, schedule, plan for next reporting period, the work of consultants, and&#13;
project administrative aspects. The progress reports will be sent to the Bank within four weeks after&#13;
conclusion of the reporting period. The first progress report will be sent three months after loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
4.26         The Borrower will submit a mid-term progress report, covering all components of the&#13;
project, no later than December 31, 1997. In addition to the topics covered by the semiannual reports,&#13;
the mid-term report will include an assessment of the status of loan covenants, overall institutional&#13;
performance of the companies-beneficiaries, and evaluation of the project based on a set of performance&#13;
indicators (Annex 11). This report will be reviewed with the Bank by no later than March 15, 1998, and,&#13;
based on the recommendations of the report and the Bank's views on the matter, measures will be taken&#13;
to ensure the efficient completion of the project. The timing of the mid-term review and the performance&#13;
indicators were agreed at negotiations (paras. 6.1.m, 6.1.n).&#13;
4.27          A project implementation completion report will be submitted to the Bank promptly after&#13;
the completion of the project, but no later than 6 months after the Loan Closing Date. The report will&#13;
discuss execution of the project, its costs and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the World Bank&#13;
and other agencies involved, and lessons learned. The report will also contain evaluation of the project&#13;
performance indicators.&#13;
4.28          In addition to the review of procurement actions, semi-annual reports and other&#13;
documentation, a number of supervision missions is planned. The first mission is planned [after Board&#13;
approval and prior to the loan effectiveness].  A project launch workshop will focus on project&#13;
implementation schedule, arrangements, local funding, monitoring, evaluation and reporting&#13;
arrangements, and Bank procurement, disbursement and other procedure. The project is expected to&#13;
require supervision from the Bank at an average of 25 staff-weeks per year during the first two years of&#13;
implementation, and 15 staff-weeks per year thereafter (Annex 12).&#13;
H. Operation&#13;
4.29         As a result of the project, fuel stock levels at the power plants will cover at least 40 days&#13;
of coal and mazut/gas during the last quarter of each year, stocks of spare parts and equipment will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation                                                                        43&#13;
sufficient to cover the maintenance needs of the industry and to meet short-term challenges, metering and&#13;
communications equipment will be in place to measure and account for electricity flows at key delivery&#13;
points and to facilitate information flow between key market participants. Under the project, training will&#13;
be provided to the staff of the power companies in the operation and maintenance of the modernized&#13;
metering and communications system, and particularly to NDC staff in the area of wholesale market&#13;
operations. The facilities installed by the project will be essential for the successful functioning of the&#13;
wholesale market, including daily bidding, dispatching, metering, verification, and settlements. Finally,&#13;
GOU and the power industry will be better prepared to implement the privatization of generation&#13;
companies and oblenergos. The operation plans of NDC and thefour thermal generation companies were&#13;
agreed during negotiations (para. 6.1.o). Among other things, the operation plans of the generation&#13;
companies will include an environmental management and monitoring plan to ensure that the expected&#13;
reduction in emissions per unit of electricity generated materialize, and total emissions stay within&#13;
acceptable limits (see Section D in Chapter 11 and Annex 11).&#13;

V. PROJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS&#13;
5.1            Project Risks. The project can be characterized as a high risk - high payoff operation.&#13;
Project risks can be divided into two groups. The first group of risks are associated with the policies that&#13;
Ukraine follows in the energy sector:&#13;
Table 5.1 Policy Related Risks and Mitigation Measures&#13;
Risk                                 Proposed Mitigation Measures&#13;
1.     The recent improvement in payment                 The Energomarket Members Agreement&#13;
collection proves to be temporary, and           outlines a set of actions to be taken when a&#13;
payment discipline deteriorates, leading again   supplier is in arrears to the market. The&#13;
to the shortage of working capital and           EMA has been signed by all generation&#13;
reducing the expected gains in generation        companies and suppliers, and is expected to&#13;
plant availability under the project.            be enforced collectively by the market&#13;
members and the regulatory agency.&#13;
2.     Due to political and social considerations,       Assuming that the number of consumers&#13;
state owned suppliers (oblenergos) continue      receiving "special treatment" is limited, the&#13;
providing electricity to consumers who are in    provisioning for bad debt included in the&#13;
default.                                         Collection Agreements will ensure continued&#13;
payment to generators. In addition, the&#13;
presence of private (non-tariff) suppliers as&#13;
voting members in the market is expected to&#13;
make the market less inclined to tolerate large&#13;
scale non-payment by oblenergos, since this&#13;
will increase the price solvent customers have&#13;
to pay for electricity. In the long run, the&#13;
privatization of oblenergos is expected to&#13;
increase their autonomy and reduce their&#13;
susceptibility to political pressures.&#13;
3.     Due to political pressures, the wholesale price   Wholesale prices will be based on&#13;
is not allowed to reflect fully the cost of      competitive bids from generators rather than&#13;
electricity generation.                          on a subjective estimate of generation costs.&#13;
The National Electricity Regulatory&#13;
Commission, the agency that determines the&#13;
rules for the calculation of wholesale prices,&#13;
has been given considerable autonomy in a&#13;
Decree signed by the President.&#13;

4.     NDC is unable to administer properly the        A staffing plan for the respective divisions of&#13;
bidding and settlement procedures.              NDC was agreed with the Bank during&#13;
negotiations. All positions have been filled&#13;
with qualified staff. New staff will receive&#13;
training and technical assistance in the&#13;
operation of the bidding and settlements&#13;
systems.&#13;
5.     Due to the surplus of generation capacity,      The generation companies will receive&#13;
some thermal generation companies are           assistance to ease their adjustment to the new&#13;
unable to cover their fixed costs and service   competitive environment. There are several&#13;
their debt from their revenue from electricity  options available to the generators to improve&#13;
sales.                                          profitability: (i) rehabilitation of marginal&#13;
generation units in order to increase their&#13;
efficiency; (ii) increasing the availability of&#13;
low cost generation units; and (iii) reduction&#13;
of fixed costs, e.g., the retirement of obsolete&#13;
capacity, shedding of remaining non-core&#13;
activities, reduction of surplus labor,&#13;
reduction of social expenditures, etc. Under&#13;
the project, the generation companies will be&#13;
required to maintain a healthy debt-service&#13;
coverage ratio.&#13;
6.     The benefits of time-of-use electricity pricing  Competition among non-tariff suppliers is&#13;
do not materialize due to the limited interest  expected to ensure that the difference between&#13;
of large consumers in the reduction of their    peak and off-peak wholesale prices is passed&#13;
electricity bill.                               on to large final consumers. The&#13;
liberalization of the economy and the&#13;
elimination of the soft budget constraint of&#13;
industrial enterprises (as a result of&#13;
privatization and other measures) is expected&#13;
to increase the responsiveness of consumers&#13;
to price incentives.&#13;
5.3           Benefits. By establishing the conditions for the stabilization of the financial situation of&#13;
power generation companies and NDC, the project will ensure the availability of adequate working capital&#13;
for the operation of the power industry. The build up of fuel and spare parts inventory will increase the&#13;
availability of thermal power plants eliminating unmet electricity demand. Additional benefits are the&#13;
higher efficiency of fuel use and improved environmental performance of the plants. The benefits of the&#13;
metering and communications component include the reduction of generation costs due to changes in the&#13;
load curve, and the (non-quantified) general benefits of the comnmercial, competitive operation of the&#13;
whole electricity system. Economic returns are very robust relative to variations in key project&#13;
parameters and assumptions.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
ELECTRICITY MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ELECTRICITY DEMAND FORECAST&#13;
1.           Due to the large uncertainty surrounding the course of future economic changes in&#13;
Ukraine, alternative electricity demand projections were prepared by the Bank. Scenario A assumes a&#13;
comprehensive and radical reform process, including raising electricity tariffs to economic levels in the&#13;
near future and the strict enforcement of hard budget constraints for enterprises. By contrast, Scenario&#13;
B reflects slow-paced reforms and restructuring, meaning that the completion of price adjustment is much&#13;
deferred and enterprise budget constraints remain soft. Importantly, the pressure on enterprises to&#13;
restructure towards a less electricity-intensive product mix and to use electricity more efficiently is much&#13;
weaker in Scenario B than in Scenario A. Scenario C tracks a middle course between these two extreme&#13;
outcomes by portraying a gradual, steady progress towards a market-based economy.&#13;
2.           Macroeconomic performance. In Scenario A, GDP recovers from the recent slump in&#13;
1996, and the economy is set to grow at relatively high rates (an average 5.5% per year over the 1996-&#13;
2010 period). In Scenario B, GDP continues to contract longer, the recovery is weak and the post-&#13;
recovery (1998-2010) growth rate, at about 3.5%, is lower. Scenario C is an intermediate case, with&#13;
an average growth rate of 4.5% per year in the post-recovery period of 1997-2010.&#13;
3.           Structural shifts in total output.  Ukrainian enterprises must make changes in their&#13;
product mix under any reform scenario. These shifts are assumed to benefit the less electricity-intensive&#13;
consumer industries, high technology manufacturing and services at the expense of the presently oversized&#13;
heavy industries. The structural transformation proceeds at various speeds in the three scenarios, the&#13;
fastest being in Scenario A and the slowest in Scenario B.&#13;
4.           Electricity price adjustment. In Scenario A, non-residential electricity tariffs reflect&#13;
economic levels; the presently cross-subsidized tariffs for households reach economic cost level level by&#13;
the end of 1996. The shift to economic cost levels occurs more gradually in the other scenarios.&#13;
5.           Price responsiveness. Consumer sensitivity to changes in electricity prices corresponds&#13;
to that of a reformed semi-market economy proxied by Hungary. Under Scenario A, the assumed short-&#13;
and long-run elasticities are -0.08 and -0.16, respectively. In Scenarios B and C, which reflect a weaker&#13;
sensitivity to costs, price elasticity is set at half of the above values.&#13;
6.           Methodology. For the purpose of the quantitative projection, a dynamic consumption&#13;
model was used (described in detail in the Ukraine Energy Sector Review, Report No. 11646-UA)&#13;
7.           Projections. The forecasts to the year 2010 are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 (the&#13;
figures refer to gross consumption, i.e., they include station use and network losses; in recent years gross&#13;
consumption exceeded final, or net, consumption by about 20%). The recently experienced decline in&#13;
gross consumption (30% in the past five years) is projected to continue in 1996 in all cases. In Scenario&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX IA&#13;
Page 2&#13;
A (High Case), the early economic recovery offsets a large part of the severe price shock imposed on the&#13;
industrial users, resulting in a relatively small decrease in consumption until 1997. During the period&#13;
1998-2010, demand recovers at a rate of 3.4%  per year, reaching the pre-crisis (1990) level only towards&#13;
the end of the forecast period.  In Scenario B (Low  Case), demand levels out in 1999 at 64%  of the 1990&#13;
level, followed by a slow recovery thereafter. Under Scenario C (Medium Case), after bottoming out&#13;
in 1997-98, demand growth resumes at 3% per year, but the 1990 consumption level is not reached even&#13;
in 2010.&#13;

LEAST COST POWER INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. Methodology&#13;
1.      An analysis of the Ukrainian power system (UPS) development for the period 1996-2010 has been&#13;
performed to assess future investment strategies to maintain system's ability to supply expected electricity&#13;
demand. The analysis was performed using the least-cost methodology, which identifies power system&#13;
development plan that matches projected electricity demand and meets the standards for the reliable and&#13;
quality operation of the system at the least costs. The costs include investments, fuel, operation and&#13;
maintenance, and unserved energy. The system operational standards are defined in terms of the ability&#13;
of the system to meet capacity and energy demand at all times, taking into account reliability of individual&#13;
plants. The analysis was carried out using the EGEAS optimization model and software package'.&#13;
B. Description of the Existing System&#13;
2.      The    installed    electricity&#13;
generation capacity of the UPS was&#13;
52,122  MW   in  1995.   It included                                Figure 3.1 Capacity Mix&#13;

industrial power plants was about&#13;
2,240 MW. The total effective generating capacity of the system was about 50,000 MW, due to the&#13;
derating of older plants. Most older fossil fuel plants (about 23,000 MW) used coal as their primary fuel,&#13;
1/      EGEAS - Electricity Generation Expansion Analysis System - is a rather elaborate power system planning model developed by EPRI.&#13;
Some of the salient features of the EGEAS are capability to model: plant and system reliability, seasonal and on-peak/off-peak loads trough&#13;
load duration curves, time-changes in main parameters, demand- and supply-side options, operation of hydro plants including pump-storage&#13;
plants, environmental constraints, mutually exclusive system development alternatives, etc. A number of other features, too numerous to list,&#13;
designed to enable better modeling of system operation, investment financing, screening of altematives, etc., are also built-in. Main optimization&#13;
technique is dynamic programming, although the Bender's Decomposition Method and the Screening Curves method, helpful in screening out&#13;
expansion options, are available to the user.&#13;

combined heat-and-power plants run on gas or mazut as main fuels. Figure 3.1 shows the capacity mix&#13;
of the existing system.&#13;

(3.3 TWh imports from Russia, 2&#13;
TWh exports to Moldova).&#13;
4.    Self-consumption and losses&#13;
in generation accounted for 15.4 TWh, of which 5.1 TWh in nuclear plants, 9.3 in thermal, and about&#13;
1 TWh in other plants (industrial and hydro). After accounting for the high-voltage transmission losses&#13;
(in transmission lines of 2(20-kV and higher voltage) of 5.1 TWh, and distribution losses of 17.9 TWh,&#13;
final electricity consumption came to 151.3 TWh. The consumption was distributed across the main&#13;
consumer categories as follows: industry - 81.1 TWh; agriculture - 13.6 TWh; transport -10.3 TWh;&#13;
communal services - 14.8 TWh; residential - 27 TWh (18 TWh urban, 9 TWh rural); and other - 4.5&#13;
TWh.&#13;

8.     Electricity Demand. Electricity demand scenarios were prepared by the World Bank (see Annex&#13;
1). To reflect the declining share of industrial consumption of electricity, the yearly load factors2 are&#13;
assumed to decline gradually from the present level of about 0.73 to 0.65 by year 2010, remaining at that&#13;
level through the rest of the planning period. The maximum yearly loads were derived from the energy&#13;
projections (Annex 1) and the load factor assumption. In addition to satisfying the peak load, the system&#13;
has to have 15% reserve in capacity (the standard planning requirement for the UPS). Potential exports&#13;
were not taken into account3.&#13;
2/     The load factor for a given period is defined as ratio of average load versus peak load in that period.&#13;
3/     As mentioned in para. 6, net exports of electricity declined dramatically in the last several years. Demand has&#13;
been falling in most of the traditional Ukrainian electricity export markets. Ukraine has also difficulties in&#13;
operating its power system in parallel with other systems. It is, therefore, difficult to project levels of electricity&#13;
exports for future years. Given the relatively limited scope of this exercise, exports were not included in the&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;

9.      The system load is modeled by four load duration curves4: winter, spring, summer and fall. For&#13;
illustration, Figure 111.4 shows typical daily load profiles for winter and summer working days and&#13;
Sundays. Figure III.5 exhibits yearly maximum and minimum monthly loads for the same period5.&#13;
10.     Firm  Commitments.  The only unit assumed to be firmly commnitted was a 225-MW  unit at&#13;
Dobrotvorsk, currently under construction, and the 1000-MW Zaporozhye-6 nuclear unit, which has been&#13;
in the commissioning stage since 1995.&#13;
11.     Retirement Schedule6. The following retirement schedule was provided by Minenergo (lx100&#13;
in 1996 means that 1 unit of 100 MW  is retired in year 1996.): Slaviansk - 1x720 in 1996,1x80 in 1998;&#13;
Dobrotvorsk - 1x100 in 1996, lxlO0 in 1997, lxl00 in 1998; Kharkhiv - lx50 in 1996, lxl00 in 1997;&#13;
Mironov - lxlO0 in 1998; Starobeshevo - lx175 in 2002. In addition, 1200 MW of capacity was&#13;
assumed to be retired on the basis of the age and efficiency performance.&#13;

12.     Nuclear program. It was assumed that the new  1000-MW  unit at Zaporozhye (Zaporozhye-6)&#13;
would be in operation starting in 1996, with additional $146 million to be spent on its safety upgrades&#13;
4/      A load duration curve for a given time period represents duration of time for which the system load is&#13;
greater than a given load level.&#13;
5/       The data are taken from the July 1, 1992 - June 30, 1993 period, which has not been affected by system-wide load-shedding.&#13;
6/      Retirement of a particular unit is a decision to be made on the basis of engineering and cost data and, as such, shouId be subject to&#13;
least cost analysis as well. Given that most of the necessary data are not available at present, and given the extent of the data and engineering&#13;
effort needed for their assessment, no attempt was made to optimize retirement schedule. The schedule, rather, was assumed on the basis of&#13;
available data on plants' age and efficiency and the retirement schedule for some plants as given by Minenergo.&#13;

during the 1996-1998 period. The Chemobyl units 1 and 3 were assumed to be decommissioned in 1999&#13;
and 2000 respectively. The Chernobyl unit 3, currently out of operation, would not be restarted, so that&#13;
the Chemobyl plant would be effectively closed by year 2000. One thousand MW of nuclear capacity&#13;
was assumed to be unavailable throughout the planning period due to safety upgrades.&#13;
13.   Candidate Units. The following units were considered as candidates for the system expansion&#13;
(the first number in parentheses represents construction costs, with interest during construction included,&#13;
in US$ million; the second number represents duration of construction, in years): 120 MW single cycle&#13;
gas turbine (357, 3), 450 MW combined cycle gas turbines (770, 4), 500 MW pulverized coal unit (1500,&#13;
5), and 500 MW mazut steam unit (1135, 4). Also, pump storage units of 324 MW in generating and&#13;
408 MW in pumping regime, with cycle efficiency of 0.7 and yearly generation of 492 GWh, were&#13;
considered in order to model the Dniester pump storage plant (PSP) as a candidate. The remaining&#13;
investment costs for the Dniester PSP, taking into account that about 70% of civil works and 20% of&#13;
equipment was completed, were estimated at 227$/kW (of generating power), i.e., the cost of total&#13;
completion was estimated at US$ 514.8 million (in 1994 US$).&#13;
14.   The three nuclear units under construction, Khmelnitsky-2 and -3 and Rovno-4, were treated also&#13;
as candidate units rather than committed resources, with the respective completion costs assumed at US$&#13;
356 million, US$ 1271 million and US$366 million, as preliminarily estimated in a recent report jointly&#13;
prepared by Minenergo (Ukrainian Ministry of Energy) and the US Department of Energy. The earliest&#13;
possible completion years for these units were set at 1998, 1999 and 2001, respectively.&#13;
15.   Fuel Prices. The price of natural gas was assumed to escalate from $80/tcm in 1996 to $1 10/tcm&#13;
in 2010, in real terms (in 1995 US$) with uniform growth rate over the period. The price of mazut was&#13;
increased from $80/ton in 1996 to $85/ton in 2010, and the price of coal from $30/ton in 1996 to $35/ton&#13;
in year 2100. Calorific values of the fuels were assumed at 8.1 Gcal/tcm (gas), 9.7 Gcal/ton (mazut),&#13;
and 5 Gcal/ton (coal). The price of nuclear fuel was assumed at $ 5.2 per MWh electricity produced.&#13;
16.   Other assumptions. Given the current low level of maintenance activities and the need to&#13;
improve maintenance, the operating and maintenance costs were assumed to rise from their current levels&#13;
by 10% annually in real terms until 2000, and at 5% thereafter. The discount rate, used both for&#13;
levelizing all costs and for the calculation of interest during construction, was 10%.&#13;
D. Results&#13;
17.   The least cost plan consists of early rehabilitation of hydro and thermal plants (starting in 1996&#13;
and spread over the planning period)7, completion of Khmelnitsky-2 and Rovno-4 1000-MW nuclear units&#13;
in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and completion of the seven 324-MW Dniester pump storage units during&#13;
the second half of the planning period. Completion of the Khmelnitsky-3 1000-MW nuclear unit and&#13;
construction of one 450-MW combined cycle gas turbine plant in 2010, were also part of the least cost&#13;
7/    No attempt was made to derive a comprehensive least cost thermal rehabilitation plan, as assessment of&#13;
costs and benefits data would require detailed engineering studies of all thermal plants which are candidates for&#13;
rehabilitation. Cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation options were assessed on the basis of data available from studies&#13;
of several plants (available in project files).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

solution. The short-run system marginal costs at the generation level increased from USc3/kWh in 1996&#13;
to USc4/kWh in 2010.&#13;
18.    The least cost analysis leads to the following two general results:&#13;
(i)    the early additions to the system  (rehabilitation of hydro and thermal plants and&#13;
completion of the two nuclear units) are driven by contribution of these plants to&#13;
lowering system operation costs rather than by the needs for new capacity; in other&#13;
words, savings in system operating costs which these measures bring outweigh the&#13;
investment costs incurred and, therefore, justify their implementation although the system&#13;
has a significant capacity surplus;&#13;
(ii)    given the system demand and the capacity additions due to efficiency gains (as explained&#13;
above), there is no need for new capacity in the system for the next 10-12 years.&#13;
19.    The first result is, obviously, sensitive to the costs and benefits associated with the proposed&#13;
measures. Completion of the two nuclear plants is particularly sensitive to the completion costs and the&#13;
differences in prices between nuclear and fossil fuels. An increase in completion costs and/or nuclear&#13;
fuel could result in a delay or rejection of completing the units. The assumed completion costs are based&#13;
on prelirninary estimates, and a detailed engineering study would be needed to firm up the estimates and&#13;
the conclusions.&#13;
20.    The most important consequence of the second result is the suggestion not to proceed with&#13;
completion of the Khmelnitsky-3 nuclear unit, which would not be justified on the least cost basis.&#13;
Eventual completion of the plant, as well as other investment decisions suggested by the least cost plan&#13;
for the second half of the planning period, can be deferred and re-examined as the time passes. One&#13;
exception to this is the optimal timing of the completion of the Dniester pump storage plant. Due to&#13;
difficulties in modeling the technical capability, constraints and costs of various plants to follow the fast&#13;
load changes (within one hour) and regulate the system frequency, the least cost models (EGEAS&#13;
included) generally tend to under-estimate system needs for peaking and regulating capacity. Therefore,&#13;
in light of current needs for peaking capacity and fast reserves in the system, it would be necessary to&#13;
re-examine the suggested optimal timing for completing the daily-cycling Dniester PSP using a&#13;
chronological simulation of system operation based on hourly modeling of system operation, rather than&#13;
through the models based on monthly/seasonal/yearly load duration curves8.&#13;
21.    The fact that the IJkrainian power system has a significant surplus capacity concentrated in base-&#13;
load units, much of which belongs to older and inefficient coal plants, calls for further refinement of the&#13;
least cost plan in terms of optimal rehabilitation and retirement schedule of these plants. It would be&#13;
difficult to make the refinement using the system-wide least-cost modelling, as the necessary engineering&#13;
8/     When using simulation models in conjunction with least cost models, compatibility of results may be&#13;
affected by possible differences in modelling assumptions, techniques and approaches (e.g., reliability of individual&#13;
plants and probabilistic modeling of meeting system demand may be taken into account in the least cost models but&#13;
not in the simulation, etc.). A care must be taken both to ensure maximum compatibility and to interpret results&#13;
when complete compatibility is not possible to achieve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX lB&#13;

and cost data requirements are extensive and would be expensive, if not impossible, to assess and collect.&#13;
The decisions would have to be made basically on case-by-case basis.&#13;
22.   The results of the least cost analysis should be interpreted in the context of structural and other&#13;
changes in the Ukraine's economy in general, and the energy and power sectors in particular. These&#13;
changes will have direct impact on major assumptions underpinning the least cost analysis: electricity&#13;
demand, structure of electricity consumption, fuel and investment costs, environmental performance&#13;
requirements, etc. Energy and electricity intensity of the Ukrainian economy is expected to decrease as&#13;
economic efficiency improves with market reforms. This has been taken into account in the least cost&#13;
analysis through demand forecast. It should also be expected that demand-side measures will be better&#13;
understood, both in terms of their costs and potential impact, and become appealing both to the&#13;
consumers and suppliers, allowing their explicit treatment in the least cost analysis as resources which&#13;
compete with the supply-side measures. Least cost planning should be an on-going exercise, continuosly&#13;
updated as new data and system development options become available.&#13;
23.   As the market reforms in the power sector advance, all investment decisions will be increasingly,&#13;
and eventually, completely decentralized. Although the least cost planning will remain to be a useful tool&#13;
for investors in assessing competitiveness of particular investment options, information problems and&#13;
more complex market structure will qualify its results, which should be interpreted in conjunction with&#13;
other estimates of profitability and risks of investment proposals.&#13;

ELECTRICITY MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
NUCLEAR SAFETY&#13;
1.           Nuclear power in Ukraine currently provides almost one-third (34 % in 1995) of electricity&#13;
generation and represents 26 % of installed capacity. The 14 Soviet-designed operating units include 11&#13;
pressurized water reactors of the VVER- 1000 type, two older 440 MW units of the VVER 213 type, and&#13;
two graphite water reactors of RBMK-1000 type at Chernobyl. Three more VVER-1000 reactors are in&#13;
an advanced stage of construction at the Rovno, Khmelnitsky and South-Ukraine plants.&#13;
2.           The safety of nuclear reactors in Ukraine has been a major concern for the international&#13;
community. Especially serious doubts remain amongst international nuclear safety experts about the&#13;
safety of the RBMK reactors at Chernobyl (which account for 5% of total electricity generation).&#13;
Chernobyl Unit 4 was destroyed in April 1986 and is encased in a deteriorating concrete shelter&#13;
(sarcophagus). Unit 2 has been shut down since the October 1991 fire in its turbine-generator block.&#13;
A safety review conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency in March 1994 found numerous&#13;
safety deficiencies in the two units which remain operational. Of particular concern are specific problems&#13;
in the design of the first generation Unit 1. These deficiencies include an insufficient emergency reactor&#13;
cooling system and vulnerability to serious failures, particularly from fires, as a result of poor diversity&#13;
and separation of electrical cables and equipment in the reactor control and protection systems. Unit 3&#13;
is a second generation RBMK reactor with significant safety improvements. However, it is in an&#13;
increased radiation environment emanating from the neighboring destroyed Unit 4. Although planned,&#13;
there is currently lack of safety-upgrading activities at Chernobyl. Only limited safety-enhancing&#13;
measures were undertaken due to the original 1991 decision to terminate operations by the end of 1993.&#13;
In addition to these shortcomings at Chernobyl, most of Ukraine's nuclear plants suffer from inadequate&#13;
instrumentation and control and weaknesses in management and training. The lack of financing severely&#13;
constrains the ability of Goskomatom (the nuclear operator) to carry out maintenance and to undertake&#13;
work to improve safety, including the procurement of up-to-date equipment and spare parts. The loss&#13;
of highly skilled personnel who moved to Russia because of higher compensation also has a negative&#13;
effect on safety. The price of electricity sold by the nuclear plants was substantially increased lately,&#13;
alleviating somewhat the financing constraints.&#13;
3.           In response to mounting domestic and international safety concerns following the fire in&#13;
Unit 2, Parliament mandated that the Chernobyl plant should be closed by the end of 1993 and imposed&#13;
a moratorium on the completion of new nuclear units under construction. In November 1993, as a&#13;
consequence of the deterioration in the country's energy supply, Parliament revoked the order and&#13;
allowed continued operation as long as "technically feasible". Also, in February 1994 a presidential&#13;
decree was issued approving the recommissioning of Unit 2. The Government's plan includes the&#13;
completion of nuclear units Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 by 2000 (the completion of South Ukraine 4 is&#13;
hampered by the lack of cooling water). The construction of a new, structurally safe sarchophagus is also&#13;
planned for the destroyed Unit 4 at Chernobyl.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
4.           The G-7 Summit Meeting, held at Naples in July 1994, called for the closure of the&#13;
Chernobyl plant as an "urgent priority". The meeting outlined a broad sectoral Action Plan for the&#13;
closure of Chernobyl, including the early completion of three nuclear reactors (Zaporozhye 6, Rovno 4&#13;
and Khmelnitsky 2) to adequate safety standards, comprehensive energy sector reforms, rehabilitation of&#13;
conventional power plants, increased energy conservation, and the use of alternative energy sources. The&#13;
G-7 offered to provide an "initial" amount of US$200 million in grants, in addition to the contribution&#13;
offered by the European Union (US$120 million in TACIS grants and US$480 million in long-term loans&#13;
from EURATOM). Support from the international financial institutions and other donors was also called&#13;
for . The Ukrainian authorities indicated that they were prepared to consider and discuss possible early&#13;
closure of the Chernobyl plant, provided that a satisfactory solution was identified, in particular, for&#13;
financing replacement nuclear capacity, closure costs, including the mitigation of the social costs of&#13;
closure.&#13;
5.           The dialogue between the Ukrainian authorities and the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working&#13;
Group led to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Ukraine and the G-7 in&#13;
December 1995 that provides for the closure of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) by 2000.&#13;
The MOU provides a comprehensive framework under which projects totaling over $4 billion would be&#13;
implemented and the G-7 would make efforts to mobilize grant or concessional financing for non-revenue&#13;
earning projects such as the closure costs, ensuring the safety of the sarcophagus, and social impact&#13;
m-nitigation. The international financial institutions would play major roles in funding conventional&#13;
replacement capacity. EURATOM, EBRD and EIB are analyzing the possible financing of the&#13;
completion of two more modern nuclear reactors (Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky 2) provided these are shown&#13;
to be part of a least cost investment program in the context of a competitive market-based power sector.&#13;
A grant form the EBRD-managed Nuclear Safety Account for the short-term safety upgrade of the&#13;
Chernobyl reactors is under consideration, together with funding preparation for decommissioning of the&#13;
CNPP. According to the Government, mobilizing adequate funding is essential to maintaining successful&#13;
implementation of the MOU.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
ELECTRICITY MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STATEMENT OF ELECTRICITY POLICY&#13;
1.           Since late 1994, the Government of Ukraine has been undertaking a comprehensive&#13;
stabilization and structural reform program. This program aims to reduce inflation, restore economic&#13;
growth and alleviate poverty. This will be achieved through a combination of fiscal prudence and&#13;
monetary restraint, combined with measures to promote economic efficiency. These measures are aimed&#13;
at enhancing the role of competitive markets in the Ukrainian economy by trade and price liberalization,&#13;
privatization, private sector development, and restructuring of the public sector, while improving the&#13;
effectiveness of the social safety net for the most vulnerable groups in the adjustment process.&#13;
2.           Macroeconomic stabilization and general structural reform will be necessary for the&#13;
success of power sector reform, and will ensure that the customer base consists of financially-viable&#13;
enterprises with strong payment records. In turn, the program underway in the power sector will make&#13;
a substantial contribution towards the medium-term goal of creating a more efficient power industry,&#13;
attractive to private capital and no longer dependent on state support. Moreover, by improving the&#13;
quality and reliability of electricity supply -- a basic input for production -- the reform of the power&#13;
sector will also facilitate Ukraine's industrial recovery.&#13;
3.           In late 1993, the Government of Ukraine prepared a "Concept for the Development of&#13;
the Energy Sector of Ukraine for the Period up to 2010." This "Concept," which has been approved by&#13;
the Supreme Rada, spells out the following main directions for Ukraine's long-term energy strategy:&#13;
*     the development and implementation of a policy that promotes energy savings;&#13;
*     economically and environmentally justified utilization of domestic energy sources;&#13;
*     restructuring of the economy that reduces the energy intensity of production;&#13;
*     increasing reliance on alternative (renewable) energy sources.&#13;
4.           In early 1994, the Parliament passed a Law on Energy Conservation. The Law provides&#13;
economic incentives for investments in energy conservation, including subsidies and earmarked loans.&#13;
In order to prepare the necessary regulations and to coordinate the implementation of the Law, a State&#13;
Committee for Energy Conservation was established in July 1995 (a National Energy Conservation Center&#13;
was established under the Ministry of Power a year earlier, in 1994). The Government approved the&#13;
regulations for the operation of the national extra-budgetary energy conservation fund in February 1996.&#13;
5.           The main directions of Ukraine's long-term energy strategy were reconfirmed in a&#13;
subsequent National Energy Program approved by Parliament in early 1996. For the power industry,&#13;
the "Program" divides the next 15 years into two periods: the period of stabilization in 1996-2000, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2&#13;
the period of development in 2001-2010. Taking into account expected energy savings of 6-8 TWh/year&#13;
in the first period and 30-35 TWh/year in the second period, the "Program" predicts that electricity&#13;
generation will not reach the 1990 level before 2010 (see Annex 1). Investments in the 1996-2000 period&#13;
will focus on the rehabilitation of thermal and hydropower plants. In addition to extending the life of&#13;
these plants, rehabilitation would be aimed at maximizing the use of domestic coal, and improving plant&#13;
reliability and environmental performance. Planned investments in new capacity in the same period&#13;
would include the completion of the Dniester pump storage plant, and the Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky 2&#13;
nuclear units currently under construction. In order to meet the expected increase in demand for&#13;
electricity after 2000, the "Program" recommends the construction of additional pump storage (Kanev),&#13;
hydro (Tisa), nuclear (Khmelnitsky 3 and 4) and thermal power (about 3500 MW) capacity, while&#13;
continuing the rehabilitation and modernization of existing thermal and hydropower plants in the 2001-&#13;
2010 period.&#13;
6.           Complementing these documents on Ukraine's national energy strategy, in December 1995&#13;
the Ukrainian Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the closure of the&#13;
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The MOU records the agreement between the Governments of the G-7&#13;
countries, the Commission of the European Communities and GOU on the "elaboration and&#13;
implementation of a Comprehensive Program to support the decision of Ukraine to close the Chernobyl&#13;
Nuclear Power Plant by the year 2000.", provided that a mutually satisfactory solution was identified for&#13;
financing replacement nuclear capacity and closure costs, including the mitigation of the social costs of&#13;
closure. The "Comprehensive Program" includes:&#13;
*     the restructuring of the power sector to develop a financially sound electricity&#13;
market;&#13;
*     a least cost investment program  to rehabilitate thermal and hydro plants,&#13;
complete pumped storage units and nuclear reactors in Khmelnitsky and Rovno,&#13;
and to implement energy efficiency projects;&#13;
*     nuclear safety improvements including the short term  safety upgrade for&#13;
Chernobyl unit no. 3, decommissioning of the Chernobyl Plant, and dealing with&#13;
the shelter for Chernobyl unit no. 4;&#13;
*     a plan to address the social impacts of the closure of the Chernobyl plant;&#13;
*     the identification and mobilization of internal and international financing to fund&#13;
the above activities, with loans considered for revenue generating projects, and&#13;
grants and domestic resources for non-revenue generating projects.  The&#13;
signatories and the international financial institutions will meet annually to&#13;
monitor the implementation of the "Comprehensive Program."&#13;
7.           Within the context of the National Energy Program  and the Memorandum  of&#13;
Understanding, the Government of Ukraine has taken a number of steps to meet the broad policy&#13;
objectives contained within both documents, especially in the power sector. Key among these actions has&#13;
been the creation of a competitive wholesale market for electricity (the Energomarket), the corporatization&#13;
and commercialization of power sector enterprises, the creation of the appropriate regulatory,&#13;

policymaking, and corporate governance framework, and the introduction of competition to ensure the&#13;
long-term financial viability of the power sector. Accordingly, the appropriate corporate, regulatory, and&#13;
policymaking institutions have been created and staffed to ensure that power sector operations are&#13;
efficient, market-driven, and properly regulated.&#13;
8.           Live operations of the Energomarket have been taking place since April 1996. The&#13;
Government of Ukraine views the present period as one of transition, and a number of actions are&#13;
currently being undertaken to ensure that the power sector is fully competitive and operating in a&#13;
financially-sustainable manner. Actions currently being implemented include the following:&#13;
*     strengthening financial discipline in the power industry, in particular,&#13;
implementing a new set of procedures to deal with payment arrears reducing the&#13;
role of barter in the electricity market;&#13;
*     reducing the cost of privileged household electricity tariffs and transferring these&#13;
costs to the budget in 1997; and&#13;
*     minimizing the number of non-paying customers temporarily entitled to continued&#13;
electricity service, and ensuring that the cost of nonpayments is recovered in a&#13;
transparent manner.&#13;
9.           Over the medium- and long-term, the Government of Ukraine plans to create a policy&#13;
environment that will ensure that the power sector is financially healthy, properly managed and regulated,&#13;
and governed by market forces. To this end, the Government of Ukraine will undertake the following:&#13;
*     Wholesale electricity prices will be set through competition between generation&#13;
companies. Regulated retail electricity tariffs will be based on the wholesale&#13;
price plus a regulated margin that would cover transmission and distribution&#13;
costs. The methodology for the calculation of retail prices as established by the&#13;
National Electricity Regulatory Commission will be incorporated into the licences&#13;
of the oblenergos (distribution and supply companies). Non-regulated retail&#13;
electricity prices will be set through competition between a sufficient number of&#13;
licenced suppliers.&#13;
*     Non-paying customers will be subject to the reduction and cut-off provisions&#13;
codified in the Energomarket Members' Agreement and the Collection&#13;
Agreements between the National Dispatch Center and the oblenergos&#13;
(distribution and supply companies);&#13;
*     The power sector will be regulated through a system of licenses administered by&#13;
the National Electricity Regulatory Commission. The regulator will enforce&#13;
competition, prevent monopoly abuses, and protect consumer rights; and&#13;
*     The Government will develop and implement a program of privatizing thermal&#13;
power generation and distribution companies.&#13;
The Government of Ukraine is committed to the policy objectives spelled out in the&#13;
National Energy Concept and ensuing policy documents such as the National Energy Program and the&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding. The Government of Ukraine recognizes that the introduction of market&#13;
forces and the commercialization of power sector enterprises will be critical to ensuring the power&#13;
sector's long-term financial health and investment potential.&#13;

components:&#13;
(1)   Incentives and penalties to encourage Debtor to collect from customers on&#13;
time and in full;&#13;
(2)   Transit accounts to channel collected funds to the correct industry&#13;
participants in the correct amounts each day; and&#13;
(3)   Special collections procedures to deal with retail customer payment&#13;
defaults.&#13;
1.2   Establish a procedure for determining the amount due to NDC by Debtor as of&#13;
the Cutoff Date (June 30, 1996), and agreeing the terms on1 which this debt is to be paid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
2.    Debtor Obligations&#13;
The Debtor is hereby obligated to:&#13;
2.1    Before 14 June 1996 to:&#13;
(1)    Appoint a director of special collections with the duty and capabilities to&#13;
perform the special collections procedures set out in Schedule 1 attached&#13;
hereto;&#13;
(2)   Provide sufficient staff, premises and facilities for special collections&#13;
operations; and&#13;
(3)    Notify NDC in writing of the specific special collections arrangements&#13;
made.&#13;
2.2    Before 14 June 1996, the Parties shall agree on the money amount owed by&#13;
Debtor to NDC as of the close of business on 31 March 1996; and within one month after the&#13;
Cutoff Date the Parties shall agree on the amount owed by Debtor to NDC as of the close of&#13;
business on the Cutoff Date, this later amount being the "Old Debt".&#13;
2.3    Assure that from the Cutoff Date onward:&#13;
(1)    All cash proceeds from retail electricity sales are paid directly into the&#13;
Debtor transit account:&#13;
(2)    Any non-cash payments by retail electricity customers are promptly&#13;
recorded in the form of a Transfer Order to NDC and the amount due to&#13;
Debtor from the customer is correspondingly reduced;&#13;
(3)    Subsidy Certificates for all qualified customners are promptly obtained and&#13;
conveyed to NDC and the amouniit due to Debtor from the customer is&#13;
correspondingly reduced;&#13;
(4)   All customers in Default according to the Schedule 1 rule are promptly&#13;
transferred to the special collections group for further processing;&#13;
(5)   The special collections group performs the special collections procedures&#13;
precisely according to the rule in Schedule 1, and promptly notifies NDC&#13;
of any failure to do so; and&#13;
(6)    Any auditor authorized by NDC shall be given full and timely access to&#13;
all billing and collection records of Debtor customers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.4   The full amount of Debtor's Old Debt principal is to be collected through the&#13;
special collection procedure and the application of proceeds set out in Section 3.2 below.&#13;
However, the Debtor shall in any case be directly liable for:&#13;
(1)   Payment of Old Debt principal no later than a schedule comprising 36&#13;
equal monthly payments beginning 1 August 1996; plus&#13;
(2)   Monthly interest payments at the Ukrainian interbank overnight lending&#13;
rate on the Old Debt balance outstanding at the close of each business&#13;
day. Interest shall be calculated beginning one month after the Cutoff&#13;
Date, when the principal amount of the Old Debt is to have been&#13;
determined. The first such interest payment shall therefore be due two&#13;
months after the Cutoff Date.&#13;
Payment according to this schedule of any then unpaid Old Debt and interest is a direct and&#13;
absolute obligation of Debtor and is not limited by funds available in Debtor's transit account.&#13;
However, if Debtor fails to make such scheduled paymenits, NDC may make such payments&#13;
directly from funds otherwise due to Debtor from the Debtor transit account or take any other&#13;
available enforcement action. All such payments are to be made to the NDC transit account&#13;
unless Debtor is notified otherwise by NDC with NERC approval.&#13;
3.    NDC Obligations&#13;
NDC is hereby obligated to:&#13;
3.1    As Market Funds Administrator, transfer funds out of the Debtor transit account&#13;
in strict accordance with the Market Fund Procedures ("MFP"). Such transfers shall include&#13;
daily payments to Debtor of its NERC-authorized fees and to the NDC transit account, all&#13;
prorated for payment defaults and adjusted for offsets.&#13;
3.2   Apply each day, all proceeds received from  Debtor, its retail customers, or&#13;
another party for the benefit of Debtor according to the priority and proration rules set out in&#13;
Appendix 6 of the Market Fund Procedure. These proceeds include:&#13;
(1)   Cash payments by retail customers into the oblenergo transit account;&#13;
(2)   Transfer orders files with NDC by a generator, or by the Debtor pursuant&#13;
to Section 2.3.2 of the Agreement, in connection with a barter offset&#13;
transaction;&#13;
(3)   Subsidy certificates for both statutory subsidies and Default Subsidies&#13;
granted by NERC pursuant to Section 3 of Schedule I hereto;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(4)   Promissory notes issued pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement; and&#13;
(5)   Bad Debts determined in accordance with Section 11.2 of Schedule I of&#13;
this Agreement.&#13;
4.    Promissory Notes&#13;
Upon request by NDC, Debtor shall issue unsecured promissory notes in any&#13;
standard negotiable form specified by NDC, according to the Old Debt scheduled principal&#13;
payments in Section 2.4(1) above.&#13;
4.1   Such notes shall include provision for payment of interest by Debtor in&#13;
accordance with Section 2.4(2) above.&#13;
4.2    NDC shall, within one business day of issuance, sell any such notes through an&#13;
official securities exchange to unrelated parties and have the proceeds paid&#13;
directly to the NDC transit account to be applied according to Section 3.2 above.&#13;
NDC shall have the right to grant to its creditors the right of first refusal to&#13;
purchase such notes at the market price so long as such right does not have the&#13;
effect of significantly reducing the market value.&#13;
4.3   NDC may at its sole discretion, within one business day of issuance, transfer such&#13;
notes to its consenting creditors in paymlent of NDC obligations, in which case&#13;
the MFA shall record the transaction as a payment to the NDC transit account by&#13;
the creditor for the benefit of Debtor in an amount equal to the principal amount&#13;
of the note.&#13;
4.4   Such notes shall have no claim on the Debtor transit accounts and shall be solely&#13;
the obligation of the Debtor.&#13;
The issuance of such notes does not alter Debtors absolute obligation to pay&#13;
unpaid Old Debt principal and interest according to Section 2.4. It is solely a means for NDC&#13;
to pre-pay its creditors through use of the capital markets.&#13;
5.    Other Provisions&#13;
5.1   In the even that Debtor fails to perform  its obligations under this Agreement,&#13;
NDC shall be entitled to any remedy available under Ukrainian law, including a&#13;
block on Debtors bank accounts.&#13;

Schedule 1&#13;
UKRAINE&#13;
Electricity Market Development Project&#13;
Special Collection Procedure&#13;
This schedule sets out the special collection procedures to be followed by Debtor's&#13;
Special Collections Group ("SCG").&#13;
These procedures apply to all retail customers whose bills are not paid in full&#13;
within 10 business days after the due date or who violate any NERC-approved default rule.&#13;
Such customers are in "Default".&#13;
I     Each defaulting retail customer is to be promptly notified at the time it is&#13;
transferred for special collection and is to be told what to expect if payment is not&#13;
made within a further 5 day notice period.&#13;
2.    Immediately after day on which the notice period expires (the "Default Date"),&#13;
if payment has not been made in full or a satisfactory payment plan (paying no&#13;
less than current invoices plus interest of 5 % of arrears each month) is agreed:&#13;
2.1   Service to the Defaulted customer is to be promptly suspended; and&#13;
2.2   The SCG is to file a claim against the customers bank account if this has&#13;
not already been done.&#13;
3.    If the SCG is prevented by government orders or pressures from effectively&#13;
suspending service in step 2, the SCG must immediately:&#13;
3.1   Apply to NERC to treat the unpaid and accruing amounts as a "Default&#13;
Subsidy", to be recovered through subsidy certificates; and&#13;
3.2   Publish a notice of the involuntary continuation of service, the reason for&#13;
it and the prospective financial effects on the paying customers.&#13;
3.3   If NERC grants Default Subsidy status within 10 business days:&#13;
(1)   This customer is released from special collections;&#13;
(2)   Unpaid and accumulated amounts due will be paid via Subsidy&#13;
Certificates as NERC provides; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7                                ANNEX 6&#13;
Schedule 1&#13;
(3)   Debtor's LVNO and LES service fees on these amounts are to be&#13;
paid to the oblenergo from the oblenergo transit account in the&#13;
normal way.&#13;
3.4   If NERC does not grant subsidy status within 10 business days, the&#13;
oblenergo is at fault and:&#13;
(1)   From the Default Date forward, the oblenergo is not to be paid&#13;
any LVNO or LES fee for serving the Defaulted customer; and&#13;
(2)   Beginning 3 weeks after the Default Date a penalty will be&#13;
deducted from escrow amounts due to the oblenergo in the amount&#13;
of 3 times the Defaulted customer's LVNO and LES fees,&#13;
increasing by one time each week until the oblenergo is paying the&#13;
full value of the energy being consumed by the Defaulting&#13;
customer. The proceeds from this penalty are to be applied to the&#13;
oblenergo's power purchase payment obligation to NDC.&#13;
4.    Any customer failing to perform  on an agreed payment plan is to have service&#13;
immediately suspended until the account is paid in full and acceptable security arrangements are&#13;
made to prevent a recurrence.&#13;
5.    Customers are to be discharged from special collections only when all arrears have&#13;
been paid, including interest.&#13;
6.    Full interest charges and penalties as authorized under current law (estimated at&#13;
0.75% per day but not exceeding 50% of total arrears) are to be charged to the account of&#13;
Defaulting customers who continue to receive electricity service regardless of the reason.&#13;
7.    The SCG may accept payment from Defaulted customers only in cash. All&#13;
customer barter goods must be converted to cash before payment to the SCG. Defaulted&#13;
customers may still pay through generator offsets.&#13;
8.    No LVNO or LES fees shall be paid to the oblenergo on proceeds from any&#13;
customer which is in Default.&#13;
9.    The SCG is to receive 5% of payments received from customers who were&#13;
transferred to special collections prior to one month after the Cutoff Date; and is to receive 3%&#13;
of payment from customers transferred to special collections after one month after the Cutoff&#13;
Date.&#13;
10.   The SCG is to file weekly an aged receivables reports with the NDC Market&#13;
Funds Administrator, together with a report of collections and related activities as the NDC may&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -                            ANNEX 6&#13;
Schedule 1&#13;
request. For aging purposes, customer payments are to be applied as set out in Section 3.2 of&#13;
the Agreement.&#13;
11.   Any amounts due from a customer whose service has been suspended shall be&#13;
classified as a "Bad Debt" if it is not paid in full before the later of six months after the due date&#13;
or 3 months after the Effective Date. This declaration means:&#13;
11.1  The Bad Debt amount is removed from the SCG backlog:&#13;
11.2  The Bad Debt amount is deducted from the amount due to NDC from the&#13;
oblenergo as if a payment in that amount had been received on the&#13;
writeoff date; and&#13;
11.3  The Bad Debt amount is added to the oblenergo-specific Energomarket&#13;
surcharge over a period of time, and this fact is published.&#13;
11.4  No fees shall be due to the SCG for amounts determined to be Bad Debts.&#13;
12.   NDC's auditor and market funds administrator are to monitor the performance of&#13;
the SCG. In the event of systematic failure by an SCG to properly report, suspend service or&#13;
collect payment, NDC may recommend to NERC penalties of up to 20% of the Debtor's supply&#13;
and LV fee be charged against the Debtor's transit account until the deficiency is corrected.&#13;
Proceeds from such penalties shall be applied to reduce the oblenergo-specific surcharge.&#13;
The special collection program may be modified at any time by the Energomarket&#13;
Board with the consent of the NERC, taking due account of incentive payment obligations to the&#13;
SCGs.&#13;

Performance and Monitoring Indicators&#13;
(i)    The power plants will maintain inventories for coal and mazut (including reserves to substitute&#13;
for gas) at the following minimal levels, starting January 1, 1997:&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the first quarter of a year;&#13;
-     20 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the second quarter of a year;&#13;
-      30 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the third quarter of a year;&#13;
-     40 days of winter consumption of the fuels throughout the fourth quarter of a year.&#13;
The winter consumption of the fuels is defined as the expected average daily consumption&#13;
during the 4th quarter of the year. If the specified levels of mazut reserves exceed the storage&#13;
capacity, then the minimal inventory level for mazut in such cases is defined as 75 % of the&#13;
available storage capacity. The specified minimal levels for each quarter will be reached for&#13;
at least 10 days in each respective quarter.&#13;
(ii)    Average calorific value of the coal used improved by 4% each year relative to the previous&#13;
year throughout the 1997-1999 period; the content of ash and the pollutants in the fuels&#13;
must be within the limits implied by the local enviromnental standards.&#13;
(iii)   Annual power plant maintenance plans implemented in 1997-1999.&#13;
(iv)   A decrease, in 1998, of 5% in the unplanned outage rates achieved by the power companies,&#13;
averaged over generating units, and an additional 5% decrease achieved in 1999.&#13;
(v)    System operating reserve margin maintained at the level of at least 2000 MW in 1997,&#13;
3000 MW in 1998, and 4000 MW in 1999.&#13;
(vi)   Fuel efficiency increased by 1 % percentage point by 1999, averaged over generating units in&#13;
each generating company.&#13;
(vii)   A decrease of 10% in the emissions of particulates per unit of electricity generated achieved&#13;
by 1999 and maintained thereafter; a decrease in the emissions of sulfur oxides and NOx.&#13;
(viii)  Definition of ownership of meters and rights to access and verify the metering equipment, by&#13;
July 1, 1997.&#13;
(ix)   Installation of all metering and communications equipment by the end of 1999.&#13;
(x)    Number of meters capable of metering and recording hourly energy consumption installed at&#13;
the end-user sites: 100 in 1997; 300 in 1998; 600 in 1999.&#13;
(xi)   Share of the end-use consumption, as percentage of total end-use consumption, metered by&#13;
meters capable of metering and recording hourly energy consumption: 5% in 1997; 10% in&#13;
1998; 20% in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(xii)  Payables and receivables of the four generation companies and NDC not exceeding 40 days in&#13;
1996, 35 days in 1997 and 30 days thereafter.&#13;
(xiii)  Debt service coverage ratio maintained at a level of 1.5 (or above) by the four generation&#13;
companies and NDC during the term of the Bank loan.&#13;
(xiv)  Monthly collection performance maintained at or above 90% by each oblenergo during the&#13;
term of the Bank loan.&#13;

Supervision Plan&#13;
1.           The supervision is expected to require about 25 staff weeks per fiscal year during the first&#13;
year of implementation, 21 staff weeks during the second year, and 15 staff weeks thereafter. The&#13;
schedule below is in addition to the regular review requirements for procurement actions, progress&#13;
reports, and correspondence, estimated to be about 9 staff weeks per year in the first two years, and 7&#13;
staff weeks per year thereafter.&#13;

            Ukraine - Electricity Market Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Electricity Market
            Development Project is to support the development of a
            competitive electricity market by providing working capital
            to thermal power generators for the purchase of fuel and
            spare parts, and by installing metering and communications
            equipment needed for the proper function of the settlement
            system. The project includes the following components: a)
            building up fuel stocks at thermal power plants to level
            that are consistent with standard industry practices; b)
            building up the stocks of spare parts and carrying out
            deferred maintenance at the power plants; c) installation of
            metering and communications equipment to improve recording
            and billing of electricity flows at key wholesale market
            delivery points; and d) technical services and training for
            project implementation, financial management, and the
            development of a privatization program.
