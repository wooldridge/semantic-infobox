while many governments have raised billions of dolars using this method, sorne governments&#13;
of emerging economies still fail to give it serious consideration. The main advantages of&#13;
international offerings stem from the greater market depth and liquidity provkded by&#13;
international capital markets: telecommunications companies are sometimes too big for local&#13;
markets to absorb, and more active trading attracts a wider shareholder base, implies&#13;
continuous evaluation of a company's value, and increases management's accountability for&#13;
financial performance. International offerings also enhance the legitimacy of shares being offered&#13;
because companies must comply with transparent accounting rules and strict disclosure&#13;
standards in the host market. This Note outlines the offer process and implementation risks.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Ongoing privatization and financial
            liberalization in emerging economies have let to continuous
            growth in the number of depository receipt offerings from
            these countries. Asian and Latin American companies have
            been the biggest source of offerings. The main advantages of
            depository receipts stem from the greater market depth and
            liquidity offered by international capital markets:
            telecommunications companies are sometimes too big for local
            markets to absorb, and more active trading attracts a wider
            shareholder base, implies continuous evaluation of a
            company's value, and increases management's
            accountability for a company's financial performance.
            International offerings also enhance the legitimacy of
            shares because companies must comply with transparent
            accounting rules and strict disclosure standards in the host
            market. Experience has shown that to guard against failure
            of a depository receipt issue, much effort needs to be put
            into choosing the right type of depository receipts,
            marketing the issue, forecasting investor demand, and
            determining the share price.
