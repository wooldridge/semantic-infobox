COSTS AND SCALE OF BUS SERVICES&#13;
This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that large buses&#13;
in large organizations with subsidies to produce optimum frequencies are&#13;
the best arrangement for urban road passenger transport. It is shown that in&#13;
theory small buses are often appropriate, giving the best frequencies and&#13;
speeds and suitably low average passenger waiting times. Direct observations&#13;
of minibus services in a number of cities tentatively demonstrate the veracity&#13;
of the theory. Furthermore the best institutional organization is not the&#13;
large firm or municipal authority, but the small firm, often the owner/driver.&#13;
There is no case for any substantial subsidy for appropriately organized urban&#13;
bus transport.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Bus services are the most important mode of motorized transport&#13;
in citi-s in developing countries. And, in contrast with the standard large&#13;
buses of the municipalized or nationalized undertaking in the developed&#13;
countr-ies9 ci ties ir developing countries have evolved a wide variety of&#13;
bus systems and institutional structures.  The jitney, the shared taxi, the&#13;
minibus i(12 seats or so), the microbus (less than 12 seats) and the midibus&#13;
(15-25 seats)--all exist, indeed flourish, sometimes alongside the standard&#13;
bus which one sees in the cities of Europe and America.  Similarly, while the&#13;
standard large bus is often, though not always, operated by the nationalized&#13;
concern, the small buses and taxis are normally owned and operated by their&#13;
main driver.&#13;
The natural policy questions that emerge are: What is the best&#13;
institutional form for urban bus services? Should they be nationalized or at&#13;
least stringently regulated as the only way to "integrate" or "coordinate" bus&#13;
services---or can these functions be performed better in another way? Should&#13;
there be a bus subsidy and if so in what form? What size should the buses be?&#13;
Should there be a mixture of sizes as well as institutional forms?&#13;
For an informed discussion on such policy matters, one requires first&#13;
an analysis of the principles involved. The concept of economies of scale in&#13;
the bus business has been confused with the economics of the size of bus.&#13;
Whether larger firms enjoy lower or higher costs is quite different from the&#13;
issue of larger buses being more or less efficient than smaller buses. Also&#13;
to be considered as part of the input of bus operation is the time spent&#13;
waiting or traveling by passengers; therefore any optimization policy resulting&#13;
from these variations in time inputs should be taken into account. It is&#13;
clear that a free market system would take into account much of the time-of-&#13;
passenger effects--and primarily by using a "small bus" that would give rise&#13;
to profitable frequencies and trip times. The external economies of scale of&#13;
increased frequency of bus services would be largely incorporated in private&#13;
decisions, and thus there is no reason to suppose that, above some very small&#13;
minimum size of firm, there are any substantial economies of scale either&#13;
external or internal. On the contrary there are good reasons for supposing&#13;
that unit costs will be higher for the large firm and that it will have less&#13;
incentive to take into account the externality of passengers' time.&#13;
If these theoretical conjectures have any substance one would expect&#13;
to observe in cities where there is a wide degree of freedom to develop&#13;
appropriate vehicle size and institutional forms: (a) markedly small buses on&#13;
the average, (b) small firms, (c) lower fares and better service, that is to&#13;
say better frequencies, than in cities which have the traditional large bus&#13;
in a municipal organization. Similarly where there is competition between the&#13;
small bus operator and the large municipal organization, one would expect the&#13;
small man to be the winner. These predictions are borne out in a survey of&#13;
a number of cities in developing countries (and in the odd case of Belfast)&#13;
where there is some freedom for private operators to enter the industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
The main policy implication to be drawn from this discussion is&#13;
that there is a prima facie case for giving private operators some substantial&#13;
freedom to enter the urban bus business. The second part of this paper concen-&#13;
trates on an evaluation of just such a policy change. In Kuala Lumpur the&#13;
government allowed a substantial but limited number of minibuses to enter the&#13;
industry during 1974-75. It is shown that very large benefits flowed from&#13;
this policy change--amounting to nearly one percent of the incomes of residents&#13;
of Kuala Lampur--and even larger benefits are achievable with a more liberal&#13;
policy.&#13;
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that throughout the cities surveyed&#13;
here, the municipalized or nationalized bus companies always had higher costs,&#13;
although they had significant advantages granted by their concession. This&#13;
is partly because in bus transport there seem to be significant economies of&#13;
being small. The implication which needs to be explored is that free entry&#13;
into urban bus transport is the best policy option for cities in developing&#13;
countries. This would provide a fertile ground for the deployment of indivi-&#13;
dual incentives, the growth of entrepreneurship and savings and investment,&#13;
and for greater use of labor-intensive "appropriate technology."&#13;

I. ECONOMIES AND SUBSIDIES IN BUS BUSINESS&#13;
A. Economies and Externalities&#13;
1.01      It is sometimes taken as axiomatic that there are substantial&#13;
economies of scale in the business of providing bus services. And such&#13;
economies have been adduced as a rationalization for the argument that urban&#13;
buses should be subsidized. The most sophisticated version of the argument&#13;
has been advanced by Mohring (1972). He suggests that additional bus&#13;
services--characterized by increasing the frequency of buses of a fixed size&#13;
on a particular route--will inter alia reduce passenger waiting time. This&#13;
reduction in average costs means that marginal costs (in the long run) are&#13;
less than average costs, and consequently long-run marginal cost pricing&#13;
would require a subsidy. 1/ The problem has been analyzed further by Nash&#13;
(1978); he asks what would be the optimum mark up to cover costs.&#13;
1.02      One preliminary point is that economies of scale are usually&#13;
relevant for the firm. Mohring's formal analysis, however, applies to the&#13;
route and assumes implicitly that the firm or municipalized undertaking is&#13;
an aggregate of such routes. The bus firm is then assumed to enjoy constant&#13;
returns to scale with respect to the expenses that it incurs (excluding&#13;
passenger time) in providing hours of bus service. 2/ The increasing returns&#13;
arise solely from passenger time effects. Nash, on the other hand, examines&#13;
economies of scale "with respect to vehicle size" (my italics) and concludes&#13;
that they are obvious. 3/ Nash explicitly rejects the argument that one might&#13;
operate smaller vehicles: "if traffic were less dense, the cost savings&#13;
would probably not be large enough to affect the results significantly." Thus&#13;
both Nash and Mohring assume away the traditional issues about size of firm&#13;
and economies of scale and suppose that the only limit to the size of bus is&#13;
due to technological or safety constraints; otherwise, the bigger the bus, the&#13;
better. And both consider a monopoly supplier of bus services at least for&#13;
the route and probably for the city.&#13;
1.03      It is worthwhile stepping back a little from this monopoly and&#13;
reflecting on the consequences of an alternative unregulated system of free&#13;
enterprise provision of urban transport. This seems so far from experience,&#13;
1/   Mohring's development includes also a congestion effect in the additional&#13;
passengers slowing up the bus and existing passengers, and creating&#13;
system effects by the reduction of bus miles. But that is a side issue&#13;
in the general argument for a specific subsidy.&#13;
2/   The problem then tackled by Mohring is to discover the optimum frequency&#13;
and stops and journey speed of these given bus hours--which will give&#13;
rise to a number of passenger journeys/miles and hours of time both&#13;
traveling and waiting.&#13;
3/   Footnote 3, page 84.  "If it were not for (these economies) public&#13;
transport operators could offer each passenger a separate individually&#13;
tailored service."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
at least in the affluent West, that it will take some effort of the imagina-&#13;
tion--but I think that some idealized concept is necessary to see what is&#13;
foregone in the monopolized-big-bus system.&#13;
1.04      Obviously by using big buses only, much variety is lost.  There is&#13;
enormous variation in the marginal valuations of time, comfort, reliability&#13;
and many other characteristics of travel. Evidence of this appears in the&#13;
rather limited choice which regulation at present offers--private car, taxicab&#13;
and bus (ferry boat and hydrofoil, etc.).  If there are no costs of making&#13;
contracts or deals, then the technology (the size and running speed of the&#13;
vehicle, the route, the number and type of stops, the comfort level, etc.)&#13;
would respond to the bids of passengers. In principle, anyone could reduce&#13;
his waiting time to virtually zero by bidding high for a pickup--and the&#13;
existing passengers in the vehicle could decide whether they would be willing&#13;
to delay their journey for an offer so high (assuming that they had found it&#13;
worthwhile to enter into a conditional contract with the operator). 1/&#13;
1.05      In this idealized world, therefore, the costs to "other passengers"&#13;
(or what Mohring calls the "own bus" costs) and the costs because the operator&#13;
knows that stopping the vehicle will mean that he does less business (Mohring&#13;
calls this the "system" effects) are both reflected in the price system.&#13;
There is no need for any special congestion levy; it is already there.&#13;
1.06      Of course, each firm may be subject to rising costs after some&#13;
critical level of output, due perhaps to the limited supply of entrepreneur-&#13;
ship. Rising costs of the individual firm, however, may be associated with&#13;
a falling long-run average and marginal cost curve of the industry if there&#13;
are external economies, that is, external to the firm but internal to the&#13;
industry. This is the competitive analogue of Mohring's monopoly. To be&#13;
eligible for a subsidy, the external economies must be technical and not&#13;
pecuniary.  And in this case they are: the greater the quantity with a fixed&#13;
size of bus, the lower the waiting time.&#13;
1.07      It is important to note that the Mohring assumption of a constant&#13;
technology whatever the size exaggerates the external economies of scale&#13;
effect. There are many ways of increasing frequency and many ways of varying&#13;
waiting times in response to demand. The ideal offer procedure with passenger&#13;
bid and operator-cum-passenger response outlined above is approximated in&#13;
various practices which involve saving on the expense of information and&#13;
contracting. Well-defined "express services" and "door-to-door" services&#13;
would set up at the side of the mass transit slow stage services. Operators&#13;
would have the incentive to adjust their technology to the demand and probably&#13;
some classification of service would emerge. Vehicles would probably exhibit&#13;
a standard schedule for stops and special stops and an hour-of-day tariff.&#13;
And passengers who got into a specific kind of bus would know the probability&#13;
of stopping and the approximate journey time compared with other services.&#13;
1/   Ignoring the "free rider" problem.  Similar difficulties occur if there&#13;
is a large number of passengers waiting at the stop; it is then a group&#13;
decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.08      In a free system, one may well conjecture that the average sized&#13;
firm would be rather small if one were to judge by the few cases where there&#13;
is free entry. Notwithstanding the municipalization or nationalization (or&#13;
integration--whatever that may be taken to mean) of bus services, the evidence&#13;
is that internal economies of scale are quickly exhausted. 1/&#13;
B. Profitable Adjustments of Bus Frequencies&#13;
1.09      One interesting question is whether or not Coase's theorem would&#13;
apply to the demand for the "quality" of the service which is reflected first&#13;
in the reduced waiting time and second in the reduction in journey time. 2/&#13;
These are not externalities in the strict sense that they are not the subject&#13;
of market transactions. In the ideal model they clearly are. Bus operators&#13;
would not merely adjust their equipment but also their operating patterns to&#13;
respond to profitable reductions in both waiting and journey times. In&#13;
principle, they would produce reductions in time provided that the passengers'&#13;
marginal valuation of the time savings exceeded the marginal costs of produc-&#13;
tion. 3/&#13;
1.10      But this is the story for a particular firm acting individually.&#13;
In particular, if the firm expanded its services, while other firms did not,&#13;
there would be a miniscule increase in the frequency of services and a small&#13;
reduction in waiting time. 4/ If, however, all firms expanded their services&#13;
together, there would be a significant reduction of waiting time (cet par) and&#13;
so an increase in the marginal valuation of existing travel and probably some&#13;
expansion of the kilometers traveled. Thus, it appears as a market failure--&#13;
each individual firm finds it unprofitable to expand, but if everyone did it&#13;
together, it would be profitable for all.&#13;
1/   Lee, N. and Steadam, I., "Economies of Scale in Bus Transport," Journal&#13;
of Transport Economics and Policy, vol. 4, No. 1, 1970. There is no&#13;
necessary correlation between the size of firm and the size of vehicle&#13;
that the firm operates--small firms may operate big buses or large&#13;
firms may operate small minibuses or even microbuses.&#13;
2/   Coase, R.H., "The Problem of Social Cost," Journal of Law and Economics,&#13;
vol. 3, pp. 1-44, October 1960.&#13;
3/   In its essence, Mohring's model did this but with a fixed unit of&#13;
equipment (size of bus) and an average value of time. These are rather&#13;
severe limitations. For the bus system is optimized, even given the size&#13;
of bus, with respect to some average value of time of the average man.&#13;
Sometimes the average man may wish to spend a lot to save time, or perhaps&#13;
to get to his destination with certainty by a particular time, and he&#13;
would be willing to pay for an express service. And most people are not&#13;
average anyway. The suppression of variety in constructing bus systems&#13;
for the average is one of the characteristics of, for example, London's&#13;
bus system. (In some American cities, express or limited-stop services&#13;
are run but usually with standard equipment.)&#13;
4/   This argument (and Mohring's) hinge crucially on the fact that the&#13;
services are not timetabled or scheduled. If services run to sched-&#13;
ules, the Coase theorem can be easily applied and bargains between&#13;
runners of adjacent services will ensure the optimality of the result.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.11      It appears, however, that such effects would be reflected in suitable&#13;
institutional arrangements if the costs are low enough. For example, the&#13;
frequency of-fct works on a particular route; thus it might pay a broker to&#13;
act as the solo int4rmadiary on that route buying the services of the transport&#13;
agents and contracting them to potential passengers. The frequency externality&#13;
would then become internalized. 1/ But even if the costs of brokerage were&#13;
prohibitively highs it is worthwhile reflecting on the performance of the&#13;
competitive market in supplying the public with the frequency it wants. Oddly&#13;
enough one of the bitter complaints by the operators, not the passengers,&#13;
against an unregulated urban bus system is that it gave rise to too many and&#13;
too frequent buses. 2/ The pirate bus operator who a minute or so before the&#13;
"regular operator" swooped on the queue at the bus stop was the man singled&#13;
out for excoriation; but he was indeed responding to the demand for a reduction&#13;
in waiting time. Even in the static equilibrium sense, each competitor would&#13;
have an incentive to reduce the waiting and travel time of passengers since&#13;
quick trips and short waits would command a higher fare. 3/&#13;
1.12      It will also be noted that in other competitive situations, the same&#13;
sort of externality is to be found. For example, consider a number of super-&#13;
markets serving an area of homogeneous density and imagine, a la Mohring, that&#13;
the supermarket has to be a fixed size. Then if the population and the demand&#13;
doubled, there would be approximately twice the number of supermarkets and&#13;
this would result in a considerable reduction in the access time of customers&#13;
to the stores. Thus, the marginal valuation of the stores' services would&#13;
increase.&#13;
1.13      Yet there are rarely any suggestions that these external economies&#13;
be used as an argument for subsidizing the grocery business. 4/ Such reluc-&#13;
tance is partly a consequence of the belief that external economies are small&#13;
and in any case probably offset by diseconomies (of congestion, etc.), and&#13;
partly it could be claimed that the supermarket and grocery business can&#13;
adjust very well to peoples' desire for quick access by establishment of&#13;
higher price small shops, (Ma and Pa shops), specialist shops (such as Seven&#13;
Eleven) and so on. Over a certair range, varying the size of the super-&#13;
market by having two small ones rather than one big one--is also a method of&#13;
reducing access costs at the expense of some economies of scale.&#13;
1/   it may be thought that the broker would be a monopolist; however, if&#13;
there were free entry into brokerage business, this would ensure that he&#13;
priced competitively. Furthermore, there is always the option of the&#13;
firms selling directly to passengers and this ensures that the situation&#13;
will be no worse than the standard competitive case with externalities.&#13;
2/   Such complaints are to be found in the reports which in the late 1920s&#13;
and early 1930s preceded the "rationalization" and municipalization of&#13;
urban bus services in the West and particularly in Western Europe, and in&#13;
countries where minibuses compete with stage buses today.&#13;
3/ The great advantage of the competitive process is, however, not to be&#13;
found in the discussion of static optima. Competition gives rise to a&#13;
continuous and urgent seeking of new techniques and new arrangements for&#13;
giving the public what they are willing to pay for. It is the dynamic&#13;
process set in operation by the search for profit that gives rise to the&#13;
singular success of competition.&#13;
4/ And in any case it could be reflected by the state levying lower taxes&#13;
on small stores.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
C. Bus Size, Waiting and Traveling Time&#13;
1.14      Why do these arguments not apply to public bus transport? 1/&#13;
It is worthwhile doing a calculation of the costs of reducing the size of&#13;
buses from the present standard (circa 40 to 60 seats) and either increasing&#13;
frequency or reducing running time or both. These measures will reduce the&#13;
passenger's input of his own time and in the latter two cases, there will also&#13;
be an increase in the utilization of the equipment. In order to make the&#13;
comparison simple--and, incidentally, to load the argument against the smaller&#13;
bus--I shall assume that the question is one of replacing one 40-seat stage&#13;
bus by two minibuses such that the frequency of service is exactly the same.&#13;
Thus we can imagine that the minibus picks up at every other stage bus&#13;
stop--so the stage bus stops twice as frequently as the minibus. 2/  A fdcther&#13;
limitation is that we imagine the service as a typical commuter collector (or&#13;
delivery) service; commuters are collected along the route and delivered to&#13;
the central business district. The reverse happens in the evening. 3/&#13;
1.15      We now need to know something about bus and minibus costs.  The&#13;
evidence of this is rather messy and has been reviewed in Annexes 1 and 2.&#13;
The broad consensus of this information is that the capital costs diminish&#13;
more rapidly than the number of seats. Probably operating costs, other than&#13;
labor, decrease proportionately with seating capacity. Labor input declines&#13;
less than proportionately; but in order to load the case against the minibus&#13;
we shall assume that per bus-hour the same quantity of labor is required&#13;
whether it be a big or a little bus. Thus, the fraction of total cost per&#13;
hour attributable to labor is larger in the minibus than in the big bus.&#13;
From one country to another there is a wide variation in the fraction of total&#13;
costs (excluding subsidies) allocated to labor--from as low as 20% in some&#13;
developing countries to about 50% in the United States. 4/  For our illustra-&#13;
tion we take 50%.&#13;
1.16      Thus suppose that the cost of a big bus per hour in operation is&#13;
$20, of which $10 is paid in wages, the cost of an hour's operation of a&#13;
1/   The increased congestion costs seem even more apposite to increased&#13;
numbers of buses than in the case of stops.&#13;
2/   It is convenient to assume that the route is long so that there are a&#13;
larger number of stops and so that end effects are ignored.&#13;
3/   For normal stage bus traffic, this is a point against the minibus&#13;
service since it does not cater for all intermediate stops. Thus, one&#13;
could not use the two-minibus system to go from A to B. Such rigidity is&#13;
in the model and would not be characteristic of a free competitive&#13;
system; there is likely to be a variant if there is a sufficient revenue&#13;
to be gained from it.&#13;
4/   In the United States, "transportation costs" are about 57% of total&#13;
bus operating costs--and 81% of transportation costs are attributable to&#13;
wages. See Table 22 of Characteristics of Urban Transportation Systems,&#13;
UMTA, 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
minibus will be $15, of which $10 is wages. But the minibus operation will&#13;
involve fewer stops--approximately half the number--so the overall speed of&#13;
the minibus will be greater than that of the big bus. We may take the speed&#13;
of a bus as being approximately one-half to three-fifths of the speed of&#13;
automobile nonstopping traffic on city streets. Again, leaning against the&#13;
minibus, let us assume the speed as three-fifths. By cutting out half the&#13;
stops, the minibus should attain a speed of four-fifths the speed of nonstop&#13;
traffic. Thus fQr the same number of kilometers as the big bus runs in an&#13;
hour, one minibus will cost $11.25, and thus to replace one big bus by&#13;
the two minibuses will cost $22.50--a premium of $2.50 or about 12.5X.&#13;
1.17      The question now arises whether this premium would be paid by people&#13;
for the speedier trip.  Again, leaning against the minibus, let us suppose&#13;
that the average load factors are the same and equal to 50%--so that there are&#13;
on the average 20 people on the bus. Valuing their time at only $1 an hour,&#13;
approximately one-tenth of the wage costs of the bus, one would find that the&#13;
15-minute savings on what was previously an hour's ride would give a total&#13;
time-saving valuation of $5--i.e., twice the additional cost of the minibus.&#13;
1.18      It is clear that, if everyone had this same value of time in the bus&#13;
of $1 an hour, the private enterprise system would choose the minibus system&#13;
rather than the big bus arrangement. Indeed, a value as low as $0.51 would be&#13;
enough to favor the minibus on this strict comparison.&#13;
1.19      We might also briefly explore an alternative configuration and ask&#13;
whether it would not be better to increase the frequency of service and leave&#13;
the running time unchanged. Then the minibuses behave like stage buses--but&#13;
with one important proviso. Since they are picking up (and discharging) on&#13;
the average only half the number of passengers per stop, the likelihood that&#13;
there is no one at the stop will be much larger for the minibus than for the&#13;
big bus; thus it will make fewer stops. I/ However, let us again ignore this&#13;
effect with the knowledge that we are biasing the results against the minibus.&#13;
The total hourly cost of two minibuses is $30, i.e., $10 more than the stage&#13;
bus system. Suppose that the bus operates a 20-minute frequency and the&#13;
average passenger is carried for 20 minutes in the bus. Assume that the&#13;
average waiting time is one-half the headway, i.e., ten minutes. The minibus&#13;
will reduce the headway to ten minutes and the waiting time to five minutes on&#13;
the average. The bus will carry on the average 60 passengers per hour and,&#13;
under the minibus system, the savings will be five minutes waiting time per&#13;
passenger--or five hours waiting time per hour of big bus operating time (per&#13;
two hours of minibus time). Valuing waiting time at three times ($3 per hour)&#13;
the value of time in the bus, one gets a minibus saving of $15. And this&#13;
exceeds the additional cost of $10. It is clear, provided that the headways&#13;
with the big bus exceed a little less than 14 minutes (i.e., waiting time&#13;
averages a shade less than 7 minutes) it will pay to use the minibuses.&#13;
1/   If the number of arrivals at the stop are distributed as a Poisson&#13;
with means m (for mini) and 2m (for big Qus), then the reduction in the&#13;
probability of making a stop is em - e  m.  Thus if m = 1, the proba-&#13;
bility of the mini not stopping is 0.368 and the probability of the big&#13;
bus not stopping is 0.135 (a ratio of almost one third). With m = 2,&#13;
the probabilities are 0.135 and 0.018 respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.20      These criteria are much affected by the value ascribed to time.  I&#13;
have taken a low value of $1 for riding and $3 for waiting. If we take&#13;
figures which are nearer to reality in the United States--such as $2 for&#13;
riding and $6 waiting, then the critical headway falls to about 6.7 minutes and&#13;
average waiting time to 3.35 minutes. Thus, if the average passenger waits&#13;
more than about 3 1/2 minutes, it pays to switch to a minibus arrangement.&#13;
Since the minibus arrangement would be more attractive than the stage bus,&#13;
then cet par, the number of passengers would increase and frequency also would&#13;
increase.&#13;
1.21      There are obviously many other ways to serve these passengers.  But&#13;
as a general rule, the minibus allows more flexibility than the large bus.&#13;
This is obvious for the lightly trafficked routes, especially during off-peak&#13;
hours when load factors are always far below the capacity even of a minibus&#13;
(e.g., an average of, say, 5 or 6 passengers per 20-seater or 40-seater bus).&#13;
But it is important to note that the time savings of the minibus are very&#13;
important for rush-hour traffic. Thus, if the vehicles are full to their&#13;
(seating) capacity, on the average, the time saving of the small bus is double&#13;
that which was calculated above (or alternatively the critical average waiting&#13;
time falls to 3.35/2 or 1.67 minutes).&#13;
D. A Simple Model of Bus Size&#13;
1.22      The numerical results suggest that one can develop a simple model&#13;
of the size of bus and the effect on frequency and waiting time. Suppose that&#13;
labor costs per bus hour are the same whatever the size of the bus and whatever&#13;
the load carried. The bus stopping costs are the same per passenger. The&#13;
other (non-labor) costs of a bus are proportional to the capacity of the bus,&#13;
and taking the load factor as fixed, proportional to the number of passengers.l/&#13;
1.23      Now define a "standard bus" which carries a given number of p&#13;
passengers per hour. (If, for example, each passenger journey took 20 minutes,&#13;
the average load on the bus would be p/3 passengers--and this is assumed to be&#13;
well below the capacity of the bus.) Let the parameter As be used to indicate&#13;
the size of bus so that the number of seats is proportional to  X-  and for&#13;
the standard bus  )&gt;  = 1.  If the standard bus is used, the headway gives an&#13;
average waiting time per passenger trip of v hours and each hour of waiting&#13;
time is assumed to be valued at %f w, where w is the wage cost per hour of the&#13;
bus, ( '  &gt;0). 2/&#13;
1.24      Consider halving the size of bus, compared with the standard,&#13;
so that -- = 0.5, then the headway will be halved and the waiting time will,&#13;
on the average, also fall to v/2. The costs of the smaller buses per passenger&#13;
will be larger but, to some extent this will be offset by the reduction in&#13;
waiting time.&#13;
1/   In Pnnex 2 it is shown that these assumptions are approximately correct,&#13;
excfpt that (a) the wage costs decline significantly with the size of bus,&#13;
and (b) the smaller buses have larger load factors.&#13;
2/   The headway is the time interval between buses; thus if h is headway&#13;
v = h/2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
1.25      One can find the optimum size of bus by constructing the (continuous)&#13;
total cost function for p passengers. But since we are interested only in&#13;
those elements that vary with size of bus, we can be cavalier-like about&#13;
non-wage bus costs and the value of passenger time in the bus.  Wage costs for&#13;
p passengers are equal to the wage cost (I, "b) per bus multiplied by the&#13;
number of buses per hour. This number is equal to the reciprocal of the&#13;
headway (with  &gt;   -1) which is in turn equal to twice the average waiting&#13;
time.  Thus the wage cost term is w/(2 v  X ).  Passenger waiting costs are&#13;
the product of number of passengers (p), the average waiting time with the&#13;
standard bus (v), the index of bus size (,A  ) and the value of time ( 'f&#13;
Thus costs are:&#13;
C(           w        +        pvw     + non-wage   + passenger&#13;
bus cost    journey time costs&#13;
-2&#13;
dC(     )   _-w&#13;
and    d            2v       +    pv./' w      -  0  for minimum costs.&#13;
Solving the equation:&#13;
_W-2            2,&#13;
-w~ X   +    2pv.  v    -  0, subject to the condition  w &gt; 0,&#13;
we get               1 - /v y2p.'&#13;
where the positive branch of the root is the only one of interest. 1/&#13;
1.26      This formula can be interpreted quite simply:&#13;
For a given number of passengers per hour&#13;
make the size of the bus inversely&#13;
proportional to the average waiting&#13;
time when using a standard bus.&#13;
1/   This is a transportation version of the ubiquitous square root law of&#13;
inventories or batch size. See Herbert Mohring Transportation Economics,&#13;
Ballinger 1976, p. 145 et seq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
1.27      And if one is willing to assume that the value ofA /is about 0.5&#13;
(and there is evidence that this is sometimes an appropriate value), the&#13;
formula becomes even more simple: 1/&#13;
A= l/v F7&#13;
To illustrate this:  if the average waiting time is 6 minutes (0.1 hours),&#13;
and if the bus carries 100 passengers an hour, then the standard bus is&#13;
appropriate since&#13;
A=   1/0.1            =  1&#13;
the standard bus is just right.&#13;
1.28      It will be noted that for a given average waiting time the larger&#13;
number of passengers per bus hour the smaller the optimum size of bus. A&#13;
larger number of passengers per bus hour can be due to either (a) an increase&#13;
in load factors (which it will be recalled are assumed the same for all sizes&#13;
of bus) or, (b) a reduction in the average length of journey. The latter&#13;
point is intuitively sensible: small buses should be used for short journeys&#13;
(such as feeder services). The first proposition is less clear: it implies&#13;
that if there are a larger number of passengers, that is to say the buses are&#13;
fuller, the bus size should be smaller. But, other things being equal,&#13;
increase in the load factor simply increases aggregate waiting time; and a&#13;
reduction in bus size reduces actual average waiting time. To avoid misunder-&#13;
standing, it must be recalled that the load factor is always assumed fixed and&#13;
given exogenously when we examine the optimum size of bus.&#13;
1.29      The most unrealistic aspect of this formula is the assumption that&#13;
wage costs do not rise with the size of bus. Wage costs of the small bus are&#13;
likely to be far less than those of the large bus.&#13;
1/   But such simplicity may be misleading.  Care must be exercised in&#13;
using this relationship. For example, it is illegitimate to argue that&#13;
as p-+ 0, A -- 0o  so that one would have an infinitely large bus for&#13;
no passengers! The error arises because v cannot be taken as given and&#13;
independent of p. For low values of p, the minimum standard vehicle&#13;
(passenger car) comes into its own and v increases. (And one may add&#13;
that the assumption of random arrivals of passengers becomes more and&#13;
more tenuous.) Thus if the number of passengers an hour falls to 5 or&#13;
even 10, one is in the taxi business and responding to demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
1.30      There are two separate influences in labor costs: first, the pecuniary&#13;
effect of increases in wage rates and associated restrictive practices, and&#13;
secondly, the fact that, even under free contractual conditions, bus entrepre-&#13;
neurs find it profitable to increase their manning scales to include fare&#13;
collectors or conductors. 1/&#13;
1.31      The driver of a minibus commands a lower wage than the driver of the&#13;
big bus. While there is undoubtedly less "skill" and training involved in&#13;
driving a small bus, the main explanation is the virtually ubiquitous unioni-&#13;
zation of drivers of large buses. This gives rise to much higher wage payments&#13;
(e.g., more than double in the case of the Washington metropolitan area), but&#13;
also increases wage costs by various restrictive practices such as banning&#13;
part-time workers, restricting schedules, slow working, etc. 2/ Unionization&#13;
is virtually always associated with municipal or state ownership or private&#13;
(regulated) monopoly. It is conceivable that small buses, if used on a large&#13;
scale, would become unionized. But the evidence suggests that if the munici-&#13;
pality or state promotes unions, only weak coalitions would emerge (as in&#13;
taxis in Washington, D.C.). -&#13;
1.32      There are many examples of the use of fare collectors in the western&#13;
developed countries--particularly where fare varies with distance. In London&#13;
attempts to operate large double-decker buses with only one man were a failure--&#13;
the delays were too long and many of those buses which were designed for&#13;
one-man operation now carry a fare collector. In developing countries at&#13;
least one fare collector is the rule. Bus companies often find it profitable&#13;
to employ two or more fare collectors. 3/&#13;
1.33      It is therefore necessary to include manning rates, m (a), as&#13;
a function of the size of bus. This variable m (;).) can take into account the&#13;
fact that fare collectors cost less than drivers, and that drivers of large&#13;
buses cost more than those of small buses. The optimization then proceeds by&#13;
minimizing&#13;
C(Q )= w(3A) +,A pv^w  + (other terms independent ofi )&#13;
which gives the equation&#13;
2      2    ,&#13;
(2 pvO) A   +(dm5             mQ(t)  =  0&#13;
1/   Or alternatively off-vehicle fare collection (and policing) costs will&#13;
be incurred--such as those incurred in certain European cities.&#13;
2/   Apologists for unions may argue that such high wages are merely rents&#13;
(of exploitation?) and are not true costs in the social sense. However,&#13;
it is clear that wage rates well above the supply price of labor have&#13;
very severe social costs in the form of wasteful substitution of capital&#13;
for labor, the persistente of unemployment among the poor, the exclusion&#13;
of enterprise, and different techniques and so on. I suspect that the&#13;
difference in financial costs per unit of output understates the&#13;
difference in social costs.&#13;
3/   This is the case, for example, in Bangkok where two fare collectors per&#13;
bus are employed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
1.34      This can be solved only by specifying appropriate manning scales&#13;
which maximize the profits of the organization. It is not unreasonable to&#13;
suppose that, over the relevant range, the manning scales are linear and&#13;
increase with the size, i.e.,&#13;
m( X ) = a + b a,1     a &gt;  0 and a + b =1&#13;
Inserting this linear relationship we obtain:&#13;
2      2&#13;
(2pv X)       -a      0&#13;
and so&#13;
or with&#13;
AL =  0.5,    I =  a/v  /v&#13;
1.35      This is similar to the formula derived above, but now the term&#13;
a appears in the numerator. This term is less than unity since, for the&#13;
standard bus, we have a standarized manning scale of m = 1 in the formula&#13;
above.  Thus, a + b - 1 and if b is strictly positive then  0    a L 1.&#13;
Thus in Figure 1.1 we have plotted the manning equation with a   1/3,&#13;
b   2/3 when the standard bus has 40 seats.&#13;

1.36      For the standard bus m = 1, and the minibus with 20 seats has a&#13;
manning scale of m = 0.67. The 80-seater has a manning level of 1.67 and so&#13;
on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.37      In using this formula, therefore, we observe that the effect of&#13;
wage-costs variation is to depress the size of bus by the multiplicative&#13;
factor a. The higher the value of a the greater the manning economies of&#13;
scale. Thus if a - 1/3, M. - 0.5, v - 0.10 and p = 100.&#13;
i - 1/3&#13;
i.e., the size of bus should be one-third the size of the standard bus.&#13;
(This, of course, may be beyond the applicable range and one may choose&#13;
the smallest size of bus with the lowest wage cost.)&#13;
1.38      It is interesting to note that these are the approximate values&#13;
which one obtained from Washington, D.C. if the taxi, the medium-sized bus&#13;
(22-seat school bus) and the large metro bus are compared. 1/ Assuming&#13;
a waiting time as little as 3 minutes for an average number of 144 passengers&#13;
an hour during peak periods, this suggests that:&#13;
A = 0.33 (0.05;' '44) and thusA= 0.55,&#13;
the size of bus should be approximately half the present 55 seaters. A&#13;
smaller 30-seat bus would be, on the average, more appropriate.&#13;
1.39      For Manila we can calculate the implied values of a and b from&#13;
the labor costs of jeepneys and buses (see Annex 2, Table 1). The appropriate&#13;
equation is m = 0.148 + 0.852 A where A. is unity (and so m = 1) or the&#13;
standard 58-seat bus. The value of a implies that small buses are appropriate&#13;
in Manila. With v = 4/60 (i.e., 4 minutes) and p = 144, we find A = 0.185,&#13;
or that the best bus is about 11 seats (0.185 x 58). This is quite near to&#13;
the standard jeepney size. However, usingAM = 0.5 to refer the value of&#13;
waiting time to the wage costs of the standard 58-seat bus is clearly over-&#13;
stating the valuation of waiting time. A more appropriate value would be,6. =&#13;
0.2. This would imply that we multiply (0.185 x 58) by 45/2 to find the&#13;
value of A -- giving #R = 17 seats. It is perhaps relevant to note that the&#13;
small jeepneys have been more successful than the large buses--but this needs&#13;
investigation and is explored next.&#13;
1.40      Although these are clearly rather rough approximations to the value&#13;
of a, they do show the critical role played by economies of scale in labor&#13;
costs in the bus business. It would be convenient if one could set sensible&#13;
limits to the values of a that one might encounter in practical situations.&#13;
When a.is near to zero, this implies that the economies of scale are rather&#13;
small, whereas when a is near to unity the economies of scale are very large&#13;
indeed. We have seen in the calculation for Manila that a small value of a is&#13;
distinctly possible and one might suppose that the lower limit is around 0.10.&#13;
1/   These are $9,000 a year for the 5-seat taxi costs, $13,000 or so for&#13;
the 22 seater and $23,000 for the metro driver (including fringe benefits&#13;
at cost)--all 1975 values. The fitted equation to the two extremes is&#13;
m = 0.33 + 0.67A. There is a strong union effect in the very high wages&#13;
of metro drivers and in the higher manning requirements. This is,&#13;
however, a very crude comparison and is a poor substitute for an adequate&#13;
analysis of wage costs and manning scales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
On the other hand it is clear that the upper limit of a is not near to unity.&#13;
Probably an upper bound of about one-half is most appropriate. This implies&#13;
that a double-decker bus of 80 seats would require wage payments of 50% more&#13;
than the single-decker 40-seat bus. (Similarly, the minibus of 20 seats would&#13;
have labor costs of three-quarters of those of the single decker 40-seat bus&#13;
and half more of the double decker.)&#13;
1.41      To illustrate the application of the formula, with a value of a&#13;
equal to one half and one third (the "D.C." value), one can take the data&#13;
collected by Mohring for Minneapolis. The average waiting times, using the&#13;
standard bus during the peak and off-peak were 4.65 minutes and 7.0 minutes&#13;
respectively; the average bus occupancy was 30 minutes during the peak and 10&#13;
minutes during the off-peak. Assuming that the average journey was 20 minutes,&#13;
this gives a total number of passengers per hour of 90 and 30 respectively. 1/&#13;
With a = 0.5 we obtain:&#13;
* peak = 0.68&#13;
off-peak = 0.70&#13;
and with a = 0.33&#13;
- peak = 0.45&#13;
off-peak = 0.47&#13;
1.42      These results suggest that the size of bus in Minneapolis should be&#13;
between half and two-thirds the size of the present vehicle. Instead of a&#13;
55-seater bus, it would be best to run a 27- to 33-seat bus. Oddly enough the&#13;
size of bus which would be best for the peak periods appears to be somewhat&#13;
smaller than that for the off-peak periods. This illustrates that there are&#13;
roughly three times the number of passengers (90) compared with the off-peak&#13;
(30) who are waiting 4.65 minutes each. This large number of passengers would&#13;
benefit in aggregate more from the reduction in bus size and increase in&#13;
frequency than would the 30 passengers during the off-peak period.&#13;
1.43      One of the attractive features of this formulation is that the size&#13;
of bus is largely independent of the price of labor; it applies to high-wage&#13;
and low-wage economies. Wage costs are counterbalanced by the costs of&#13;
waiting. In the standardized formulation, however, it will be noted that the&#13;
wage cost is that of the standard bus and not necessarily the wage rate of the&#13;
driver. This can be taken into account, as we did in the case of Manila&#13;
above, by adjusting the value of    . And also, since it is likely that the&#13;
marginal costs of labor (especially unionized labor) rise steeply during the&#13;
peak periods, it may be necessary to take that effect into account in deciding&#13;
on the best size of vehicle. Such refinements, however, seem hardly worth&#13;
pursuing in a general formulation.&#13;
1/   Since people have to wait so long during the off-peak, one might expect&#13;
them to travel on the average further than journeys during the peak&#13;
period; but this is probably offset by the higher off-peak speeds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
1.44      It is important to note the status of this formula and its applica-&#13;
tion. In my view it would be quite wrong to plan a transport system on the&#13;
basis of such a formula, and indeed any other formula such as those suggested&#13;
by Mohring and Nash. To be simple, any formula has to deal only with averages&#13;
and cannot take into account the vast variation around those averages. In&#13;
particular it is clearly true that different people have enormously different&#13;
values of time--often the same people have very different values of time in&#13;
different circumstances. Equally there is a wide variety of transport routes&#13;
which may best be served by a great variety of vehicles and organizational&#13;
forms. The formulas give one a meat-axe critique of existing systems or&#13;
proposed dirigisme systems. Neither one nor the other should be unthinkingly&#13;
imposed on suffering humanity.&#13;
1.45      The second point to emerge from the evidence is that minibuses&#13;
manage to get a much larger load factor than stage buses. 1/ The assumption&#13;
of the same load factor is clearly discredited by the evidence. One would, of&#13;
course, expect such a result. But it may be argued that in certain cases the&#13;
high load factors on minibuses are due to the restrictions on the supply which&#13;
are more onerous than those on big buses. However, the same phenomena may be&#13;
observed when there is little or no restriction on minibus operation (as, for&#13;
example, in the early days in Hong Kong and Bangkok). It may well be that&#13;
this is mainly a consequence of the greater incentives present in the small&#13;
firm, often an owner or renter-driver, which characterizes the minibus trade.&#13;
If the small firm were to be allowed into the larger bus business, it is&#13;
conceivable that the load factors would also be higher--but there is little&#13;
evidence on this hypothesis. 2/&#13;
1.46      The third point is that, with the normal mixture of origins and&#13;
destinations, there is likely to be much less transferring necessary with&#13;
the small bus system. It is more likely that a passenger will find one bus&#13;
that goes all the way. This is an important advantage of the minibus since it&#13;
is well known that a transfer is a considerable deterrent not only with&#13;
transfer-time waiting costs equal to three times the on-bus time costs but&#13;
also because it adds an additional element of discomfort and uncertainty.&#13;
1/   For example, in Kuala Lumpur, the peak load factors were 0.67 for the&#13;
bus and 1.07 for the minibus, and in Belfast the load factor of the&#13;
black taxis was two-and-a-half times that of the bus.&#13;
2/   Minibuses are often accused of "creaming" the traffic--which means&#13;
roughly that they serve the services where passenger demand is highest at&#13;
profitable fares. They are said not to serve the "socially necessary"&#13;
loss-making routes. This may be true--but the fault lies with regulated&#13;
fares which prevent a profitable minibus service. In practice, however,&#13;
minibuses often provide the only service in certain areas (e.g., in the&#13;
sois in Bangkok) where no stage buses will venture. Similarly, in&#13;
Istanbul, the minibuses are given routes which have been rejected by&#13;
the municipal bus authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
1.47      The last point to consider is the effect on road congestion costs.&#13;
Superficially, it may seem that the replacement of one large bus by two or&#13;
more small ones during the peak hours would be bound to cause additional&#13;
congestion costs. Yet reflection will show that the case is clearly not&#13;
proven. It is normal to count a bus as equal to three cars or two medium-sized&#13;
trucks in order to get passenger car units (pcu's) for congestion analysis. 1/&#13;
In terms of road occupancy a minibus will lie somewhere between a large&#13;
automobile and a medium-sized truck. If the same total number of stops are&#13;
made, however, as in the first model discussed above, then it seems that there&#13;
can be little effect on congestion whether we run two minibuses or one big&#13;
bus. In fact, the minibuses would probably result in a slight reduction in&#13;
congestion since they are apt to be more lively in acceleration than the&#13;
standard bus. 2/ Probably the most important factor in the minibus favor is&#13;
the high utilization and load factor. In Istanbul, Sanli (1977) concluded&#13;
that, per passenger, the minibus (10 seats) is twice as efficient in terms of&#13;
road occupancy compared with the standard large bus. But much will depend on&#13;
the types of operation, customs and laws in the use of the highway. Many&#13;
other configurations can be considered--but at present the evidence suggests&#13;
that, for the same quantity and quality of service, the congestion effects are&#13;
small. If the quality of the service is improved for a given price, the&#13;
minibus service is likely to attract car drivers and passengers and this&#13;
substitution will reduce congestion. We conclude that the congestion effects&#13;
are likely to be small and unlikely to offset the direct effects of the&#13;
substitution of small for large buses. 3/ But this remains a weak conclusion.&#13;
Congestion and minibuses remain unfinished business.&#13;
E. Regulation and the Consequences&#13;
1.48      Before reviewing the experience of small buses in the real world,&#13;
it is necessary to set out some characteristics of the typical situations,&#13;
both regulatory and economic, of urban bus transport. To illuminate these&#13;
situations, Figure 1.2 sets out the normal two-service market situation where&#13;
there is competition between the bus and the minibus. In Figure 1.2a the&#13;
demand curve D (M = 0) shows the demand for bus trips when there are no&#13;
minibuses avaiPable. When minibuses are available at price p however, the&#13;
demand curve for bus passenger trips is shown as D (p ).  The demand for&#13;
minibus passenger trips D (pb) depends on the price oT the bus passenger trip&#13;
and is shown in Figure l.Tb. 4/&#13;
1/   See Smeed &amp; Wardrop (1964).&#13;
2/   Thus in Hong Kong, the public light buses are rated at 1.5 cars for&#13;
acceleration from a stop light.&#13;
3/   Noise and pollution are two other externalities that are normally&#13;
considered. I suspect that the minibus would gain on quietude but lose&#13;
on pollution (particularly if gasoline rather than diesel engines were&#13;
used). But such a comparison would take us far afield. On noise, see&#13;
National Research Council, Noise Abatement, Policy Alternatives for&#13;
Transportation, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1977&#13;
(Chapter 5).&#13;
4/   All the ensuing analysis refers to passenger trips--but occasionally,&#13;
whenever the meaning is obvious, they are referred to as bus or&#13;
minibus trips.&#13;
&#13;

1.49      Now we can review first the circumstances of cities where there are&#13;
no minibuses and only stage buses of the traditional size (over 40 seats).&#13;
The first archetype is.where there is a minibus ban; the authorities prescribe&#13;
that only full-sized buses are allowed. This corresponds to the authorities&#13;
specifying a supply curve of minibus passenger trips that is coincident with&#13;
the vertical axis; it does not matter what their costs are, no minibus service&#13;
will be supplied (M1=O). Let us suppose that in the big bus business the&#13;
supply curve is horizontal and that the supply curve is coincident with the&#13;
price p . (Alternatively, one may suppose that there is a regulated fare&#13;
of Pb which is in excess of marginal costs of bus passenger trips, and that&#13;
licensure of bus capacity restricts the quantity of trips.) Thus the number&#13;
of bus passenger trips is B1 at price Pb-&#13;
1.50      A second archetype is indistinguishable from the first; this is&#13;
where the costs of minibus passenger trips exceed the regulated maximum fare&#13;
which is imposed for all bus journeys, whether by minibus or stage bus. Thus&#13;
suppose that the marginal and average costs of minibus trips are p . Then&#13;
the fare regulation at pb will ensure that no minibus businesses are set up--&#13;
although people would be willing to pay more than the costs for the services&#13;
of the minibus. In fact, a particular variant of this model seems to be common.&#13;
This is where the bus operation is a municipalized or franchised monopoly. In&#13;
general, the monopoly will find it more costly to operate minibuses than stage&#13;
buses (as Nash and Mohring assume)--partly because it has unionized labor and&#13;
partly because of the inherent rigidities of scheduling and operation in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
large firm or bureaucracy. Minibuses, although providing a superior service,&#13;
could only be operated at a loss at the existing regulated fare. 11 This&#13;
franchised monopoly case is entirely different from the situation where there&#13;
are conditions of more or less free entry (or at least no effective proscrip-&#13;
tions on entry) into the minibus industry. Then, although the fares may have&#13;
the same regulated maximum, the likelihood is that small operators will find&#13;
it possible to earn at least normal profits at those fares which are thought&#13;
to be only just compensatory or normal for the large franchised monopoly stage&#13;
bus company. (This seems to be a good approximation to reality in the cities&#13;
of many developing countries, e.g., Istanbul, Manila, etc.)&#13;
1.51      The third case to consider is that where minibus fares are not&#13;
effectively regulated, and one may conveniently suppose that there is no&#13;
really effective ban on entry so that there is no monopoly control. Then, if&#13;
the authorities control the stage bus fares nicely at cost (equal to p in&#13;
Figure 1.2a), and if the costs of producing a minibus trip are constant at Pm,&#13;
there will be M minibus trips competing with the B2 bus trips.  There are, as&#13;
we shall see, many variants of this scenario. For example, in Malaysia (Kuala&#13;
Lumpur), an effective quantity constraint is placed on the minibuses, and&#13;
although their fares are regulated they are considerably above the costs per&#13;
passenger trip; yet the passenger demand is such that there is considerable&#13;
overcrowding of the minibuses.&#13;
1.52      To summarize these propositions, therefore, one would not expect to&#13;
find any substantial number of minibuses where there is a monopoly, either&#13;
municipalized or privately controlled, in the supply of bus services. The&#13;
high costs to the monopoly of small buses, together with the regulated fare&#13;
level, will ensure that minibuses have a small role, if any, in urban trans-&#13;
port. The monopoly will find that in the absence of a fare differential&#13;
the only way it can recoup the additional costs of the small bus is through a&#13;
larger number of passengers due to the shorter waiting time. This demand&#13;
effect is unlikely to outweigh the additional cost, hence the widely held view&#13;
in municipalized monopolies, enunciated by Nash, that the larger the bus the&#13;
better. If, on the other hand, the monopoly applies only to large bus compa-&#13;
nies and there is at least the p2oiility of entry, much will turn on the&#13;
conditions and particularly the regulation of fares that are imposed. Even in&#13;
the most unfavorable circumstance, where minibus fares are regulated at the&#13;
level of bus fares, one would expect to see substantial entry of minibuses--the&#13;
extent would be the result of regulation rather than by profit and loss. And&#13;
such a result would be true a fortiori when the regulated minibus fare exceeds&#13;
the bus fare. Finally, under conditions of free entry and free fare setting&#13;
one would expect that minibuses in small firm owner-driver form would become a&#13;
dominant mode, probably accounting for more than half of public transport&#13;
trips. Then the individual operators will be able to increase passenger fares&#13;
for their superior, more frequent service.&#13;
1/   In some cases, for example, in certain limited, lightly trafficked routes&#13;
in London, London Transport put on minibus service at higher fares; but&#13;
these were a minor exception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
1.53      However, as we argued above, with numerous suppliers of bus service,&#13;
there will still be a case for further increasing frequencies through using&#13;
even smaller buses. This externality will still be present, and there is a&#13;
case for introducing higher operating taxes (or smaller subsidies) per seat&#13;
on the larger buses. It is also worthwhile reflecting that in a mixture of&#13;
minibuses and buses, all buses whatever their size will enjoy the advantage&#13;
of the increased frequencies brought about by a preponderance of minibuses.&#13;
F. Case Studies&#13;
1.54      The history of minibuses is now briefly reviewed to see whether&#13;
there is any revealed evidence of their efficiency. 1/ Two caveats must be&#13;
borne in mind. First, in general one can observe only surviving minibus&#13;
systems; those that failed or were eliminated in the competitive process do&#13;
not figure substantially in this review. It is worth emphasizing that there&#13;
appear t:o be very few cases where the minibuses or jitneys have been eliminated&#13;
in a free competitive system. 2/ Secondly, one must always beware of the fact&#13;
that one may identify so-called advantages of a minibus system whereas what&#13;
one is really observing is the advantage of the competitive situation. 3/&#13;
1.5:,     In two countries, Argentina (Buenos Aires) and Honduras (Tegucigalpa),&#13;
there has been freedom for the operator to choose his size of vehicle. In&#13;
other respects, however, there is control of fares and, in the case of Buenos&#13;
Aires, stringent control of entry. In Tegucigalpa, the predominant vehicle&#13;
is the Volkswagen 10- to 14-seater bus. In recent years the increase in the&#13;
tax on gasoline has caused some decline in the popularity of the Volkswagen&#13;
gasoline bus and some shift to the somewhat larger diesel buses--but the&#13;
10-to-14 seater remains the modal model. It will be noted that the fare is&#13;
the same whether one travels by the more frequent small bus or by the less&#13;
frequent: large bus. In Buenos Aires, in a rather high wage country compared&#13;
with Honduras, the average size of bus or "collectivo" is in the region of&#13;
21 seats.  This is considerably less than the standard size bus in places&#13;
as diverse as Calcutta and London. Buenos Aires originally had a nationalized&#13;
monopoly public bus company and characteristically ran large buses. But the&#13;
business was denationalized and taken over by private operators, who reduced&#13;
the size of bus considerably. Now the operation is very efficient and the&#13;
zonal. flat rate fares are only $0.15-0.23 for this large city.&#13;
1/   The evidence in this section comes from many sources.  Those sources&#13;
that are published will be found in the references. Some information,&#13;
however, is based on unpublished material and some statements are derived&#13;
from direct inquiry or observation of the systems in practice.&#13;
2/   As far as I am aware, only the jitneys of Hilo, Hawaii were the victims&#13;
of competition from other modes.&#13;
3/   This may, but need not necessarily be associated with predominantly small&#13;
firms. But in a free entry situation, it is possible for quite large fLrms&#13;
to exist side by side with a large number of small firms; this can be seen,&#13;
for example, in the trucking business in the U.K. I cannot follow Nash&#13;
(1978) who asserts that there is "an inevitable (high) degree of monopoly&#13;
power in public passenger transport" unless he supposes that a competitive&#13;
system is "politically" unacceptable or impossible. (op cit., page 84.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
1.56      Incidentally, this disposes to some extent the argument that it is&#13;
only the ownership structure (owner-driver, etc.) that makes the m'nibuses&#13;
successful and efficient. The small firms in Tegucigalpa could have chosen&#13;
the larger vehicles; indeed some did, but most did not. In effect, the free&#13;
market choice shows that there is a wide variety of equipment and capital&#13;
structures that correspond to the variety of entrepreneurial ability. Some&#13;
operators are efficient at running large vehicles, but most appear to be best&#13;
adapted to the small ones. 1/&#13;
1.57      Another sort of comparison can be made in cities where there are&#13;
large bus and minibus services running side by side. In interpreting these&#13;
situations, one must bear in mind that both big bus and minibus firms are&#13;
often regulated with respect to the fare, the vehicle size and sometimes even&#13;
the area or route. The effectiveness of regulation varies, but generally it is&#13;
applied rather more rigorously to the large firms with stage buses than to the&#13;
small minibus firms. It is more difficult to regulate a large number of small&#13;
firms. Governments paradoxically try to encourage collusion among these small&#13;
firms so that they can be better controlled. Since one of our tests is the&#13;
profitability of the services, it may be that the net revenue is much affected&#13;
by the ability of the minibus owners to bend the rules. Some idea of the&#13;
extent of this evasion of regulation will be given in each case.&#13;
1.58      Manila (Philip2ines) is one striking example of the simultaneous&#13;
running of jeepneys, (jeeps converted, usually quite esthetically for carrying&#13;
about 14 seated passengers) and standard buses. The jeepneys are often&#13;
driver-owned or sometimes rented by the day or week; the buses are privately&#13;
owned by largish firms. The fares are the same for jeepneys and for buses.&#13;
Jeepneys, like buses, are nominally restricted to certain routes, but it is&#13;
doubtful if the regulation is rigorously enforced. Jeepneys are very frequent&#13;
and tend to stop on demand and will detour to deliver passengers to the door.&#13;
On the other hand, the average length of journey by jeepney is somewhat shorter&#13;
than that by bus. The evidence shows that although the bus companies had&#13;
overall deficits at the regulated fare, the jeepney owners were making&#13;
substantial profits. In part, this is because bus drivers, supposedly more&#13;
skilled, were paid higher wages than jeepney drivers, but on the other hand&#13;
jeepneys appeared to be better maintained than the buses.&#13;
1.59      This evidence from Manila is, of course, not inconsistent with the&#13;
view that there are substantial diseconomies generated by the ownership and&#13;
(lack of) incentive structure in large companies (bus companies must own at&#13;
least three vehicles to become licensed).&#13;
1/   To avoid misunderstanding, this does not necessarily mean that, granted&#13;
a large firm is in operation, either by decree or protection, it would&#13;
not usually be wise for it to operate large buses. If fares are con-&#13;
trolled and the firm is not induced to take into account the full value&#13;
of waiting time, it may well be considered best to run large vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
1.60      Hong Kong has privately-owned large franchised bus companies (the&#13;
main one being the Kowloon Bus Company) operating mainly double-deckers (73&#13;
seats). The minibuses, called public light buses (PLBs), have 14 seats and&#13;
are owned by small firms, (74% were one-vehicle firms.) 1/ The PLBs were&#13;
developed illegally and in their initial years were reported to have been&#13;
making fabulous profits--figures of 300% on capital were not uncommon. In&#13;
1969, PLBs were legalized but they were not controlled with respect to fare or&#13;
to route--except that they were prohibited from certain roads where it was&#13;
thought that they would add unduly to congestion. (A PLB is counted as 1.5&#13;
private cars for congestion purposes.)  The standard fare of the big bus is&#13;
HK$0.30 whereas the PLBs tend to charge about HK$0.40-0.50 and levy an addi-&#13;
tional charge to make the fare HK$0.75-1.00 or so during the peak period. The&#13;
frequency of the PLBs is on the average about 8 times the bus frequency,&#13;
giving average waiting times of 4.7 minutes and 33 seconds on comparable&#13;
routes and their speeds are on the average 15% higher. The nearly 4,000&#13;
PLBs carry one-third of all passenger trips by public transport.&#13;
1.61      Financial data are not easy to come by, but what evidence is avail-&#13;
able suggests that the rate of return on capital for a PLB is still more than&#13;
100% per annum and considerably in excess of the rate of return to the stage&#13;
bus companies (which remains at about 20%).&#13;
1.62      One interesting recent development is the likely effects of the&#13;
opening of the Metro (rail underground) system. In order to pay its way, the&#13;
Metro fare is calculated to be about HK$2.00, and it is suggested that to&#13;
induce passengers to use rail rather than bus, the stage bus fare should be&#13;
increased. The stage bus operators objected that they now earn reasonable&#13;
profits at the present HK$0.30 fare and did not want an increase! 2/ It is&#13;
not difficult to see why.&#13;
1.63      Chiengmai, a city of about 100,000 inhabitants in northern Thailand,&#13;
provides an interesting illustration of virtually free competition between&#13;
ordinary stage buses and minibuses. 3/ The typical minibus is a 1,000 cc or&#13;
1,500 cc utility van offering about 12 to 14 seats and costing about $3,750.&#13;
The typical 30-seat bus costs $22,000 to $25,000. With some important excep-&#13;
tions, the minibuses did not operate on fixed routes but responded to the&#13;
demands of passengers, whereas the buses all adopted fixed routes. The normal&#13;
flat rate fares were $0.05 by bus and $0.10 by minibus. 4/ But on costly&#13;
routes during night hours the minibus operators increase fares above the $0.10&#13;
level. In spite of the higher fares more than 90% of public transport trips&#13;

are by minibus. The bus company which is described by Fouracre and Maunder as&#13;
doing "moderately well in comparison with other bus undertakings in terms of&#13;
physical measures" is not a profitable concern and is "evidently in decline."&#13;
"It is difficult to see how it manages to survive" (op cit. p. 6). And it is&#13;
pointed out that the bus company does not increase its fares because it would&#13;
lose a substantial amount of traffic to the minibuses. The minibuses, on the&#13;
other hand, are modestly profitable, as one would expect from the more or less&#13;
free entry conditions, and provide a valuable source of productive employment&#13;
(op. cit., p. 23) at competitive levels of wages. The main conclusion to be&#13;
drawn from the experience of Chiengmai is that under free entry conditions in&#13;
medium-size cities the passengers prefer the convenience and time-saving of&#13;
minibuses even at double the fare of stage buses. One feature of the Chiengmai&#13;
minibuses is difficult to explain--that is, the very low load factor, 0.072&#13;
compared with a bus load factor of 0.21. 1/ This remains an anomaly which&#13;
must be viewed with some skepticism until resolved satisfactorily.&#13;
1.64      Kuala Lumpur introduced a restricted number of minibuses (see also&#13;
Annex 2, Table 2) in 1975 in preparation for the introduction of an Area Road&#13;
Pricing Scheme in the expectation that the better service would lure some car&#13;
owners out of their vehicles. The number was limited to 400, then raised to&#13;
450, mostly one-vehicle owners, compared with about 520 stage buses which&#13;
were organized in large private companies. The capacity of the minibus was 16&#13;
passengers and no standing passengers were allowed, whereas the capacity of&#13;
the stage bus is about 50. The fare on the minibus was a flat M$0.40, whereas&#13;
the fare on the bus is graduated according to distance starting at M$0.10 and&#13;
increasing at M$0.05 a mile--the average fare is about M$0.21. The average&#13;
load factor on the minis during peak periods was 1.07 (illustrating the fact&#13;
that the no-standing was not enforced) and that the number of minibus licenses&#13;
was the binding constraint. The buses ran at load factors of 0.67. Naturally,&#13;
the minibuses took the lion's share of long-distance routes with an average&#13;
length of trip near to 11 km. They accounted for about 35% of total inbound&#13;
trips and respond more flexibly to the peak by carrying an extra 3% (i.e., 38%&#13;
in the peak).&#13;
1.65      As one might expect, the minibuses. were alleged to be doing very&#13;
well indeed, and there is an intense demand for new licenses, whereas the stage&#13;
buses were, on the average barely earning profits. The stage buses were&#13;
understandably reluctant to expand their services unless the minibus competi-&#13;
tion were contained.&#13;
1.66      In a number of cities, the taxi has been used as a fixed route&#13;
service similar to buses. Sometimes, it has been illegal or extralegal, as in&#13;
the case of Belfast (Amos 1978). About 1971-72 in the Catholic areas of&#13;
Belfast, the municipalized city bus operations were severely curtailed, and&#13;
owner-drivers set up an alternative fixed route service by taxi at frequencies&#13;
much greater than bus, and at fares considerably below those charged by the&#13;
buses. 2/ Subsequently, the decline of police regulation saw the black taxis&#13;
1/   These were calculated from Table 20 of Fouracre and Maunder.&#13;
2/   Of course, the IRA had the choice of stealing city buses for this&#13;
service--and it is of interest that they chose to buy old London&#13;
taxis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

spread to protestant areas. The nominal capital costs are, of course, rather&#13;
small. Little is known about the labor cost, but it is known that the&#13;
load factor is two or three times the comparable bus load factors of 0.2 to&#13;
0.33. The IRA apparently earn substantial profits from this black taxi&#13;
service--as distinct from the city bus undertaking which, as so often is the&#13;
case, is substantially subsidized.&#13;
1.67      In Istanbul there are three basic modes of public transport: the&#13;
dolmus (a shared taxi), the minibus (8 to 10 seats), the midibus (13 seats),&#13;
and the standard large bus, with a few trolley buses. The latter are operated&#13;
by a publicly-owned corporation, Istanbul Electric Tramways and Tunnel (IETT),&#13;
whereas dolmus, minis and midis are owned and operated by, very largely,&#13;
owner-drivers. (We shall refer henceforth to midis as simply minibuses.) 1/&#13;
The approximate number of vehicles licensed to operate in 1976 and data on the&#13;
number of passenger trips in 1978 are as follows:&#13;

December 1978, due to breakdowns, etc., the number of IETT&#13;
buses actually in service was only about 450 or less. Mini-&#13;
bus trips were on the average longer than either bus or dolmus&#13;
trips.&#13;
Source: Sanli (1977) and author's estimates.&#13;
1.68      Entry is restricted into dolmus business by the limitations of&#13;
licensing; however, it is clear that in practice there is a substantial&#13;
unofficial operation which is the constant bane of the licensed dolmus opera-&#13;
tors' association. The municipalized undertaking IETT has first choice on&#13;
routes and then relinquishes the least desirable routes to minibus operators&#13;
who "never say no" and become the approved operators on these inferior routes.&#13;
(Dolmus are not restricted with respect to routes.) Vehicle seating capacities&#13;
are regulated by law; thus a dolmus has only up to 7 passengers, and a (strict)&#13;

minibus up to 10 seats.  Fares are regulated or formally approved by the&#13;
authorities.  Bus and minibus fares are roughly the same--US$0.10 for the&#13;
first 2 1/2 kilometers and rising rather slowly with distance.  At these fares&#13;
the IETT bus operation covers only about 35-40% of its cost, whereas, notwith-&#13;
standing very high taxes on and scarcity prices of minibuses, the minibus&#13;
operators make at least normal profits on these "inferior" routes to low-&#13;
income squatter areas (p. 120). 1/ The load factors are very high on&#13;
minibuses--the number of passengers considerably exceeding the number of seats&#13;
during many hours of the day; and on IETT buses, the load factors were also&#13;
high. However, Sanli concludes (p. 54) 1/ that minibuses have road occupancy&#13;
efficiencies equal to twice that of the fully loaded bus. Dolmus fares are&#13;
about double those of bus fares for short distances and almost four times&#13;
those for the most distant bus destinations. Nevertheless, with old, sometime&#13;
pre-World War II American automobiles, operators earn at least normal profits.&#13;
1.69      Istanbul aptly illustrates many of the points of this paper.  The&#13;
municipalized bus undertaking has a highly unionized labor force with high&#13;
wage costs (about twice those of the private sector (Table 1.1)) and has about&#13;
17 persons employed per bus in service. The fixed low fares cover only about&#13;
30-40% of costs making it difficult-to finance new buses; so the service&#13;
declines, bus miles decrease and load factors increase. But the private&#13;
sector minibuses, despite the difficulties that they encounter, can operate&#13;
profitably--but only at very high load factors. These are maintained by&#13;
restrictions on licenses. And so the final frustrated demand for cheap public&#13;
transport is squeezed out to the dolmus and induces the operation of illegal&#13;
dolmus. But the role of the dolmus in providing frequent fast and "per-&#13;
sonalized" service gives a superior, although more than twice as expensive,&#13;
alternative for those who are willing to pay as well as providing a fringe for&#13;
the frustrated bus traveler. The arithmetic of the situation is also compel-&#13;
ling. If IETT increased bus fares to break-even levels, they would be in&#13;
excess of the existing dolmus fares for all except a few very long journeys,&#13;
q.e.d.&#13;
1.70      In Bangkok (approximate population 5 million), there are known to be&#13;
about 4,000 stage buses. Until 1976 these were owned by separate relatively&#13;
efficient private firms, but following the advice of a European consulting&#13;
firm they were all amalgamated into one authority--the Bangkok Metropolitan&#13;
Transit Authority. The fares are controlled by the government at 1 baht&#13;
(about US$0.05) at a flat rate. There are an unknown number of minibuses (the&#13;
figures commonly used vary between 3,000 and 7,000) operating de facto but not&#13;
de jure in the metropolitan area. Minibuses, since they are illegal, are not&#13;
subject to formal control and little is known about the details of their work.&#13;
They respond to demand and serve the unpaved side streets (sois) and out-of-&#13;
the-way suburbs where the stage buses do not venture. They charge the same&#13;
fare as the stage buses (except it is said at certain peak periods of conges-&#13;
tion or in the middle of the night). But at this fare it is clear that the&#13;
minibus is making at least sufficient profits to induce them to stay in&#13;

business, whereas the BMTA is suffering large financial deficits. 1/  An&#13;
increase in bus fares, the normal solution for bus deficits, would encourage&#13;
-he influx of more minibuses--and it is noteworthy that the authorities have&#13;
.e..tly decided to legalize and control the minibuses.&#13;

C. c-.-.Ss ezeption of Chiengmai, the load factors of minibuses seem to be&#13;

N  t    c.a  an vehicle utilization have been included in the table, but if it&#13;

c.ties wi^?ere primarily owner driven. They were quintessentially small operators.&#13;
The stage buses were usually either larger companies or a municipalized&#13;
monopoly.&#13;
i.72      It is interesting to reflect on the reasons why the authorities&#13;
choose ithe large bus. In cities where there is a viable minibus service,&#13;
there is usually an underlying feeling by the authorities that the minibuses&#13;
should be suppressed. (The notable exceptions are Kuala Lumpur, Chiengmai,&#13;
Hong Kong and perhaps Bangkok.) It is clear that municipal authorities have&#13;
only inadequate incentive to react to the public's demand for a reduction in&#13;
waiting time. Fares are regulated and passengers are not allowed to bid&#13;
higher for a shorter wait (except insofar as they use taxis). A change in&#13;
waiting time will affect London Transport only insofar as it changes the&#13;
number of passengers traveling at the fixed fare. And if demand is relatively&#13;
inelastic (because of the costs of parking cars in London), there is little&#13;
revenue to be lost by increasing waiting time by using the large bus. Passen-&#13;
ger waiting is only fractionally reflected in the accounts of London Transport.&#13;
1/   Before "integration" of the bus companies into BMTA they were on the&#13;
average making reasonable profits. Since there is no formal provision&#13;
for financing deficits, BMTA is covering these by raiding its depreciation&#13;
funds, maintenance operations, etc.&#13;

1.73      A secona reason is that often the big bus is considerably subsidized.&#13;
This may take various forms. The most harmful is the 80% capital subsidy by&#13;
the federal government in the United States--capital is then almost a free&#13;
go.~  3ut like the free lunch, gifts from the government have very expensive&#13;
string r.ttached. Other forms of subsidy are low taxes on diesel fuel, bus&#13;
_-..s from import duty, lower license fees, and preferential traffic&#13;
arr a: ,-a t: s&#13;
A _aird reason is, I suspect, most important and that is the fasci-&#13;
sa-ion with the large '.-.tegrated" or "coordinated" transport system. 1/&#13;

Conclusions on Policy&#13;
T_a  Dolicv implications are complex and depend on mriany co-niderations&#13;
s conomic issues.  In perhaps most cities of the world, the bus&#13;
.-e     is  ulnicipalized and substantially subsidized.  It is accepted as&#13;
a 20^-ax4ortatic that all urban road passenger public transport undertakings&#13;
mus-  - sub3idized.  In the United States and many other countries, these take&#13;
of capital subsidies (where the federal government pays for about 80%&#13;
.:th  sosst of the bus) and some underwriting by local authorities of operating&#13;
Ihe form of the federal subsidy in the United States and many other&#13;
cou-,t-`,es enacourages high capitalization which gives rise to lower frequencies&#13;
and not: the higher frequencies which Moh^-.ng suggested as a rationalization&#13;
for autosidy. Similarly, the unionization of labor, indeed a condition of the&#13;
federal subsidy in the United States, encourages high wages and so supports&#13;
the overcapitalization.&#13;
1/   Since 1951 I have attempted to understand what is meant by integration&#13;
and coordination--indeed I wrote a book about it--but the only sensible&#13;
meaning I could determine is that which simulates private enterprise&#13;
market solutions. Transport planners believe, however, that they can&#13;
produce solutions far superior to the market; one's experience in many&#13;
countries casts considerable doubt on their claims.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
1.77      The municipal undertaking will have a vested interest in showing&#13;
that its choice of vehicles was correct. It would be against the grain for it&#13;
to pursue enthusiastically the provision of minibus services in competition&#13;
with its normal services. Similarly, the union would be hesitant about trying&#13;
new practices and would probably be aware of the possibility that such services&#13;
may be given out to the private sector in the form of shared taxis or the like,&#13;
which would reduce union membership. The authorities are therefore unlikely&#13;
to have the courage of the Malaysian or Hong Kong governments and authorize a&#13;
rapid expansion on such services.&#13;
1.78      One alternative method is to identify those routes which are run&#13;
because they are a "public service" and which incur the maximum losses. These&#13;
could be hived off. (This was the very successful "way in" for the minibuses&#13;
of Istanbul.) Thus to hold down the deficit of the municipalized service, the&#13;
authorities could license any operator who wishes to offer a public service at&#13;
any fares he chooses. The operator may be required to have suitable insurance&#13;
and to post maximum fares on his vehicle. Beyond this, no other control would&#13;
be imposed. 1/ A bolder step would be to allow unsubsidized competitive ser-&#13;
vices on those routes where the municipalized service is operating with an&#13;
average waiting time in excess of, say, seven minutes.&#13;
1.79      These routes would not be the dense ones on which the large bus&#13;
presumably has a relative advantage, but it is doubtful if the bus trade&#13;
unions would sit idly by as their fiefdom is clipped.&#13;
1.80      Yet another possibility can be developed organizationally from the&#13;
existing taxi service. Suppose that any taxi owner--and most are owner-&#13;
drivers--was allowed to run a shared taxi service similar to that run in&#13;
Belfast. It is then only a step to authorizing that vehicles larger than&#13;
conventional taxis may be used, giving rise to the jitney type of operation.&#13;
1.81      In practice there have been many movements toward the emancipation&#13;
of urban transport from the large municipalized bus undertaking. All have&#13;
been much constrained by the thicket of regulations and the restrictive&#13;
practices that such control has fostered. Groups of commuters or perhaps&#13;
whole small communities have operated their own private bus commuting service&#13;
with part-time or amateur drivers often at embarrassingly high profits and low&#13;
fares. Similarly, firms are finding it in their interest to organize trans-&#13;
port for workers through van pools and other administrative arrangements.&#13;
Whether these measures, technologies and systems would be adopted if there&#13;
were considerable freedom for transport to respond to the demands of passengers&#13;
is not clear. The particular forms may be the product of the regulations.&#13;
1/   Bus experts and administrators often say--"but who would want to provide&#13;
service on such unprofitable routes?" Clearly if these routes are&#13;
inherently unprofitable, t4ere is no need to prevent entry!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
1.82      In many modes of transport, recent years have seen a pronounced&#13;
shift in policy away from the controlled cartel or monopoly or regulated&#13;
"competition" toward freedom to enter the industry, to charge competitive&#13;
fares and to arrange operations according to demand. International air&#13;
transport (and domestic airlines in the United States) and trucking are two&#13;
examples where competition and freedom have brought remarkable benefits. It is&#13;
at least likely that substantial benefits would flow away from competition in&#13;
urban passenger transport.&#13;
II.  THE BENEFITS OF MINIBUSES--THE CASE OF KUALA LUMPUR&#13;
A. The Minibus Policy&#13;
2.01      The introduction of 400 minibuses in Kuala Lumpur (population&#13;
approximately one million) enables an analysis of the net benefits of the&#13;
policy changes. Minibuses, although accounting for only some 17% of total bus&#13;
capacity, carried half the bus passenger kilometers. On conservative assump-&#13;
tions it is shown that the value of the benefits was US$10 million annually&#13;
or almost one percent of income per capita. This value is surprisingly large&#13;
and suggests that such a policy might have a similar payoff in other countries.&#13;
2.02      Debates about the desirability of allowing minibus operation have&#13;
usually ended either inconclusively or with the general feeling that anything&#13;
the minibus can do the big bus can do better. On many occasions the evidence&#13;
which has been adduced to support these conclusions has taken the form of&#13;
calculations by knowledgeable operators of a bus system of the costs they&#13;
would expect if they were required to operate a minibus system.  The figures&#13;
always show that the costs of a minibus are much higher than those of a big&#13;
bus--both in terms of seat km and passenger km. The presumption is that except&#13;
for certain lightly trafficked routes, the minibus is not appropriate. (It is&#13;
rather like the exercise which is common among engineering students; they show&#13;
that a bumble bee cannot conceivably fly!) Furthermore, it is supposed that&#13;
in general the value of the reduction in waiting time occasioned by the use of&#13;
minibuses is likely for the vast majority of people to be less than the cost&#13;
premium involved.&#13;
2.03      Impressive though these a priori arguments may be, they remain based&#13;
on preconceptions rather than reality. It would be instructive to confront&#13;
these propositions with real evidence of the decisions of individuals in the&#13;
real world. Fortunately, we can now do just this. Minibuses were introduced&#13;
in sizable numbers in Kuala Lumpur in 1976. Almost 400 were licensed to&#13;
compete with the existing 700 stage buses which eventually reduced to 520-550.&#13;
The rationale for this change in policy by the Malaysian government was three-&#13;
fold: the need to expand bus transport capacity; the belief that minibus&#13;
services would reduce urban congestion by inducing existing and incipient&#13;
motorists to forego their private car trips; and because it was planned to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
introduce an area road pricing scheme rather like that which had been in&#13;
operation in Singapore since 1974 as it was perceived that additional public&#13;
transport capacity would be required. 1/&#13;
2.04      The introduction of 400 minibuses was achieved in less than two&#13;
years and during this period the price of the alternative forms of transport--&#13;
buses, taxis and (the costs of) private cars--remained substantially the&#13;
same. Bus fares were regulated and taxi fares, nominally controlled, remained&#13;
more or less the same. By 1976, most of the inflation had been eliminated&#13;
from the Malaysian economy and we can assume that there was no substantial&#13;
change in the cost of private motoring, including the congestion costs in Kuala&#13;
Lumpur and the cost of parking. The fare on the minibus was also regulated at&#13;
M$0.40 cents irrespective of distance, whereas the bus fare is graduated&#13;
according to the length of the trip, and similarly the taxi fares depend on&#13;
the length of the journey. 2/&#13;
2.05      The stage buses were given franchises to operate certain routes and&#13;
each operator can only operate on a specified route. In principle, minibuses&#13;
were also required to operate on certain routes; in practice, however, they ply&#13;
routes according to their judgment of the profitability of the traffic.&#13;
2.06      It is fairly clear that no passenger will value a trip by minibus at&#13;
a price which exceeds the price of a taxi. This gives us then an upper limit&#13;
to the demand price for minibuses. Similarly the price of taxis, in the&#13;
absence of minibuses, must give an upper limit to the demand price for bus&#13;
trips. On the introduction of minibuses, however, it is clear that the demand&#13;
curve for buses will fall, and in particular, the maximum demand price will&#13;
fall to the region of the regulated fare on the minibus alternative.&#13;
2.07      These conditions enable us to characterize the introduction of&#13;
minibuses in Kuala Lumpur in the form of demand curves shown in Figures 2.la&#13;
and 2.lb.  Suppose that pt is the price of a taxi passenger trip (or alter-&#13;
natively a private car passenger trip. The initial demand curve for buses&#13;
Db (p &gt;pt) is drawn on the assumption that there are no minibuses--hence the&#13;
presumption that the price of a minibus trip exceeds the price of a taxi&#13;
journey. The minibus fare is regulated and fixed at p --and we assume that&#13;
minibus trips are produced under conditions of constant cost equal to the&#13;
fare of p . The regulators are "experts" and have managed to fix the fare&#13;
so that the bus companies earn "normal" and not excess profits. The demand&#13;
for minibus passenger trips D (P ) is determined mainly by the price of the&#13;
substitute bus passenger trip anQ is shown in Figure 2.lb. Agaiu the costs&#13;
of a minibus passenger trip are assumed constant and equal to pm .&#13;
1/   The licensing of the minibuses and other policy measures were part of the&#13;
Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project. This project was, in part,&#13;
financed by a World Bank loan; however, no project funds were expended on&#13;
the provision of minibuses. They were financed entirely by the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
2/   As one would expect the average trip length of minibus passengers is 8.2 km&#13;
(5.12 miles) compared with 3.9 km (2.44 miles) by stage bus.&#13;

2.08      The number of bus passenger trips when minibuses are banned, is B1.&#13;
When minibuses are allowed to operate at a fare of p_, which is at least as&#13;
great as the marginal cost, they carry M2 passengers. The bus demand declines&#13;
to Db(Pm) and the number of passengers trips to B2.&#13;
B. Alternate Regulatory Systems and Effects&#13;
2.09      In practice, however, in Kuala Lumpur, regulations are imposed not&#13;
only on the fares but also on the number of vehicles (each of which must be&#13;
authorized by an official license). The effectiveness of the regulatory&#13;
legislation, therefore, depends on the extent to which, and the direction in&#13;
which, thecantrolled price and quantity deviate from what would have been the&#13;
values in their absence. First consider the case of the stage buses. It is&#13;
frequently argued by the operators that the regulated fares are below the&#13;
marginal costs of operation. Although such allegations must be taken with a&#13;
large pinch of salt, there is evidence that profits were very low in 1972-73&#13;
and in 1975-76 even with what are by normal standards high load factors.l/ A&#13;
flat rate increase of M$0.05 (about US$0.02) on all fares in 1977 was approved&#13;
to make services profitable and induce investment in new buses. 2/ The author-&#13;
ities were worried about the decline of bus services and the withdrawal of&#13;
vehicles even at the new fare. This suggests that, if not actually below&#13;
1/ This emerges from an analysis of the published accounts.&#13;
2/ After the event, the average fare was a little more than M$0.20 (about&#13;
US$0.08) which implies a simple increase of about 33%. However, this is an&#13;
inappropriate comparison because the composition of trips changed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
cost, the regulated fares were not appreciably above cost for the normal run&#13;
of services. These arguments suggest, therefore, that the assumption that&#13;
the regulated fares are near cost is appropriate. Furthermore, the quantity&#13;
constraints imposed by the licensing authority do not seem to be binding; it&#13;
is the regulated fare that constrains the supply. 1/&#13;
2.10      This has not been the case with minibuses since their introduction&#13;
in 1975. The regulated fare of M$0.40 per trip was well above the marginal&#13;
cost of providing that trip which is probably about M$0.21-0.22 (Annex 2).&#13;
There has been an insistent pressure for the issue of more licenses. (In 1975&#13;
alone applications for licenses for 2,200 minibuses were received.) And this&#13;
is clearly because substantial profits, far above normal, are to be earned by&#13;
operating minibuses. A calculation of the level of profits, and an attempt to&#13;
identify "supernormal" profits will be found in Annex 3.&#13;
2.11      If the minibus marginal costs exceed the regulated maximum bus fare&#13;
and if this regulated fare applies to all bus journeys, including those by&#13;
minibus, no minibus service could operate profitably. Thus there is no need&#13;
for regulations excluding minibus operation; the fare control--exercised over&#13;
minibuses as well as buses--is adequate to achieve that end.                 E&#13;
2.12      In Figure 2.lb there is no obvious account taken of the rationing&#13;
constraint. But the licensing control is taken into account implicitly in the&#13;
demand curve D (p).  The demand curve D (p ) in Figure 2.2 represents the&#13;
demand for minibuses when the quantity oT mKnibus licenses is constrained to a&#13;

particular figure (400). The demand curve D (p ) represents the equilibrium&#13;
demand curve when there is free adjustment oA the quantity of minibuses and&#13;
the fares to serve that demand. The former demand curve D lies below the&#13;
equilibrium demand curve D  because the licensing constraint induces operators&#13;
to crowd their buses and debase the quality of their service (for example,&#13;
with numerous standing passengers). And, of course, queueing times for the&#13;
minibuses would be far longer than under the equilibrium free entry system.&#13;
If the minibuses completely adjusted their quality of service so that the&#13;
demand price was equal to the regulated fare, the demand curve D (pb) would&#13;
pass through the point given by the regulated fare and the observed number&#13;
of passengers. Or, to put this point another way, the regulated fare&#13;
and the constraint on the number of minibuses induces the operators to crowd&#13;
their vehicles and give longer waiting times than would be the case under&#13;
free entry and fare conditions; and these lower-quality characteristics are&#13;
taken into account in the consumers' valuation of minibus passenger trips, as&#13;
shown by the regulated fare. In the evaluation of this paper, the value of&#13;
introducing minibuses has netted out the disbenefit that arises from this&#13;
continuation of both quantity (at 400 minibuses) and price controls (at M$0.40&#13;
per trip). 1/ It is necessary to. emphasize, however, that the heavier loadings&#13;
on the minibuses, which such queueing and crowding entail, contributes sub-&#13;
stantially to the excess profits of minibus owners. Thus the net loss due to&#13;
regulation is not as large as the apparent loss to passengers.&#13;
2.13      It is worthwhile reflecting on the evaluation of alternative regimes.&#13;
The first is obviously the case of complete freedom of entry and no regulation&#13;
of fares.  Then the relevant demand curve is D (p ).  Thus yith the assumption&#13;
that marginal costs are constant and equal to Fhe price (p  ), this free entry&#13;
and fare industry will result in H4 minibus passenger tripss.&#13;
2.14      The second case occurs if the fare control were removed but the&#13;
li2ensed quantity restrictions remain. Then the free fare would rise above&#13;
p   as the number of trips is reduced below M 2   Minibus operators would find&#13;
it advantageous to increase the fare and reduce their passenger loads. But&#13;
with the same number of minibuses the reduction in load factors would give&#13;
rise to an improvement in the quality of the service so the demand curve would&#13;
rise above D (pb). With the restriction on the quantity of minibuses, however,&#13;
the quality of service would not rise to the level represented by the demand&#13;
curve D (pb); the operators would find it advantageous to crowd their vehicles&#13;
more than would occur under free entry conditions.&#13;
1/   In other words the rationing process causes a dissipation of the&#13;
surplus due to the additional queues and crowding. See Yoram Barzel,&#13;
"A Theory of Rationing by Waiting," Journal of Law and Economics,&#13;
vol. 17, pp. 73-93, April 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
2.15      The third case occurs if the fare control were retained at Pm  but&#13;
the quantitative restriction on vehicles were removed. Then the number of&#13;
minibuses would expand and the load factors would fall until the marginal&#13;
minibus breaks even at the new low load factors. And these would be lower&#13;
than those implied by free entry and no fare control. Thus the quality of the&#13;
servicewould be extraordinarily high with many empty seats and very rarely a&#13;
full bus. The demand curve corresponding to this "high-quality/high-fare"&#13;
service would lie above the demand curve D (pb) since the standard of service&#13;
would be higher than would emerge in a free competitive situation.&#13;
2.16      As one would expect, the flat rate fare on minibuses in conjunction&#13;
with the graduated fares on stage buses, gave rise to the longer passenger&#13;
trips being taken by minibus. The average trip length by minibus was (8.2 km),&#13;
more than twice that of the stage bus (3.9 km). Since the average fare on&#13;
stage buses was M$0.21 and on the mninibuses about M$0.40, this implies that&#13;
the fare per kilometer was roughly the same after the minibuses were intro-&#13;
duced. 1/&#13;
2.17      In principle, one should draw figures such as 2.la and 2.lb for each&#13;
length of trip since the price ratio between bus and minibus varies systemati-&#13;
cally with distance. Where the ratio minifare/stage bus fare is lowest on long&#13;
distance trips, one would expect the switch to minibus to be high. On the&#13;
other hand, for short distances where the minibus premium is large, one would&#13;
expect stage buses to retain much of their traffic. Due to lack of data,&#13;
these refinements have not been proved in the ensuing calculations of bene-&#13;
fits. 2/  The figures must be interpreted as containing errors due to this&#13;
averaging procedure, but it is unlikely that such errors are sufficiently&#13;
important to qualify seriously the conclusions. But the distribution bus trip&#13;
length between minibus and stage bus has considerable implications for policy&#13;
which will be raised in the last section this paper.&#13;
C. Estimates of Benefits&#13;
2.18      The next task is to fill in some of the numbers on the figures.2 The&#13;
regulated price of a minibus trip, whatever the distance, was M$0.40 (=p ). 3/&#13;
Corresponding to the fare one observes that there are 400 minibuses and That&#13;
the total number of trips per day is about 200,000. This provides then one&#13;
point on the demand curve for minibuses.&#13;
2.19      An upper limit to the demand price for a minibus can be obtained by&#13;
considering the price on the superior alternative, the taxi cab. The equiva-&#13;
lent taxi fare for an average minibus trip would be on the order of M$0.80 to&#13;
M$1.00 per person, assuming three persons (an effective maximum) share the&#13;
1/   It is difficult to be precise about such calculations because of conces-&#13;
sionary fares and some split journeys by minibus.&#13;
2/   There are no detailed fare and distance distributions available.&#13;
3/   There were reports that some operators tended illegally to "split long&#13;
trips" into two separate trips and collected M$0.80. However, such&#13;
practices were thought to be quantitatively important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

cab. If the fare of a minibus trip were fixed at M$0.80, there would no doubt&#13;
be still some business for the minibuses; but we have assumed that, at this&#13;
fare, the demand falls to zero, giving an additional point on the demand&#13;
curve. 1/&#13;
2.20      The simplest assumption about the shape of the demand curve is that&#13;
it is linear and passes through the two points. This is the assumption that&#13;
is used to evaluate the consumer's evaluation of the minibus service. However,&#13;
it is worth reflecting on alternative shapes and examining the sort of results&#13;
one would obtain. One of the commonest hypothesis about the shape of the&#13;
demand curve is that it has constant elasticity, and we may attempt to draw a&#13;
curve with such a constant elasticity through the point (M$0.40, 200,000&#13;
passenger trips a day). But what elasticity? As can be readily calculated,&#13;
the postulated linear demand curve has an elasticity of (minus) unity at the&#13;
observed point and the elasticity increases as the fare increases. 2/ An&#13;
elasticity of unity is probably on the (absolute) low side and one may examine&#13;
an alternative hypothesis that the curve has a constant elasticity of (minus)&#13;
3 until it reaches the upper limit of the fare of M$0.80; then it becomes&#13;
horizontal. The constant elasticity curve is shown in Figure 2.3. It will be&#13;

1/   This assumption biases the case against the minibuses, but see next page.&#13;
2/   The Transport and Road Research Laboratory study, "A Theoretical Model&#13;
for Estimating the Effects of Fares, Traffic Restraint and Bus Priority&#13;
in Central London," by R.H. Oldfield (TRRL Laboratory Report No. 749,&#13;
1977) used an elasticity with respect to generalized cost of unity (page&#13;
7) based on "the rather inadequate evidence available." But the study&#13;
warned that "recent work" suggested that the elasticity may be rather&#13;
higher than one (presumably in absolute terms).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
noted that it cuts the linear demand curve at 100,000 trips per day, and&#13;
finally meets the horizontal line through M$0.80 at a little more than 25,000&#13;
trips a day. It is clear that the area under the truncated constant elasticity&#13;
demand curve is about the same as the area under the linear demand curve. The&#13;
refinements of nonlinearization are probably not worthwhile--but any reader&#13;
may choose his own assumptions and recalculate.&#13;
2.21      The consumer surplus can now be computed.  It is clearly: 200,000 x&#13;
(0.80 - 0.40)/2 in M$ on a daily basis, or M$40,000 per day. If this be&#13;
grossed up on the assumption that there are only 300 effective days per annum,&#13;
then the total consumer surplus becomes M$12 million per annum (approximately&#13;
US$5 million).&#13;
2.22      To find the total benefit of the authorization of minibuses, the&#13;
excess or supernormal profits of the operators must be added. This value&#13;
(Annex 3) amounts to M$32,000 for each minibus, therefore for 400 minis the&#13;
total is M$12.8 million a year. The grand total of benefits is therefore&#13;
M$24.8 million a year. And we can take it that, approximately, the total&#13;
benefits are equally divided between the customers and the operators.&#13;
2.23      The total benefits of M$25 million (approximately US$10 million)&#13;
are large. For a total non-school population of about 600,000, this repre-&#13;
sents a sizable annual dividend--about US$17 per head, near one percent of&#13;
their average income.&#13;
2.24      These figures are so large that skepticism is readily evoked.  Some&#13;
correlated figures may therefore be useful. First, on recent surveys of&#13;
minibus and bus travel for center bound journeys, the ridership is split 35%&#13;
on the minibuses and 65% on the stage buses with the minibuses, because of&#13;
their flexibility carrying many more passengers during the rush hours.&#13;
Overall, it seems very unlikely that minibuses carry less than 30% of all&#13;
trips. This should be compared with availability of about 520-550 buses and&#13;
400 minibuses--or, translated into officially rated passenger capacity (at 58&#13;
passengers per bus and 16 per minibus), 31,000 and 6,400 respectively. Thus&#13;
the minibuses have about 17% of the passenger capacity but carry 30-35% of the&#13;
passenger trips.&#13;
2.25      More important is the fact that the average length of the passenger&#13;
trip by minibus (8.2 km) is more than double that by the stage bus (3.9 km).&#13;
With a split between minibus and stage bus of 30-70, this implies that the&#13;
minibus and stage bus carried approximately the same number of passenger km.&#13;
This is for the minimum limit of the estimate of minibus passenger trips. If&#13;
we take the 35-65 split, then the minibus carried 53% and the stage buses 47%&#13;
of passenger km. By any criterion, this is a phenomenal performance: 15% of&#13;
capacity carries more than 50% of the passenger kilometers. 1/&#13;
1/   Passenger km are not homogeneous; it takes more resources to transport&#13;
two passengers for 4 km than one for 8. But still the measure is&#13;
impressive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
2.26      Second, it might be thought that some account should be taken of the&#13;
lower ridership on the stage buses and in the taxis. However, this is not a&#13;
"cost" of the introduction of minibuses except insofar as there is evidence of&#13;
marked economies of scale to the industry in these activities. All empirical&#13;
evidence suggests that there are no economies of scale, in the conventional&#13;
sense, either in the bus or the taxi business. 1/&#13;
2.27      Furthermore, the increase in frequencies which has occurred with the&#13;
mixed bus-minibus service has undoubtedly increased the demand for public road&#13;
transport. The passenger, attracted by the higher frequency of service, will&#13;
take minibus or bus, whichever gets there first. 2/ Thus there is no reason&#13;
to impute any long-term loss to bus companies or taxis for the loss of traffic;&#13;
and although the increased frequency of joint minibus and bus capacity on the&#13;
routes might be credited to the introduction on minibuses, it has been omitted&#13;
from the calculations. It might be adduced that there are some short-term&#13;
losses as the buses and taxis adjust to their new situation. The assets of&#13;
both are readily sold on the second-hand market and there seems to be no&#13;
reason to add such costs. This is particularly so in the case of the buses,&#13;
where there was obvious evidence of over-age buses and frequent breakdowns&#13;
in 1975. In 1978 the bus companies were prepared to purchase new buses,&#13;
partly for replacement purposes.&#13;
2.28      Third, one may claim that calculation of profits in excess of normal&#13;
of the minibus owners is excessive. There are no reported data in Kuala&#13;
Lumpur which can substantiate whether this is anywhere near the right figure.&#13;
In Hong Kong however it is widely reported that the rate of return on a&#13;
similar operation (the public light buses) is in excess of 100%. Furthermore,&#13;
the very large demand for the limited allowance of minibus licenses testifies to&#13;
their high profitability. It is doubtful, therefore, whether the allowance&#13;
shown in the figure for super-normal profits is too high.&#13;
2.29      Fourth, there is the problem of externalities.  It might be held&#13;
that the M$25 million is partly and perhaps wholly offset by external and&#13;
indirect effects which have now been included in the calculation. The most&#13;
obvious one is road congestion. It is not clear which way one could expect&#13;
congestion to go. On the one hand the provision of more frequent minibus&#13;
1/   In Kuala Lumpur all evidence suggests that the largest bus company,&#13;
Sri Jaya, inherited from the British, is somewhat less efficient than&#13;
other smaller companies. But I would not wish to rely solely on such&#13;
evidence. See also "Economies of Scale in Bus Transport," N. Lee and I.&#13;
Steadman, Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, 4, No. 1, 1970.&#13;
2/   On some routes where minibuses and buses operate, there has been some&#13;
reduction in stage bus frequencies. Consequently, the passenger who has&#13;
a low value of time may have to wait longer for a stage bus. However, he&#13;
is more likely not to be bypassed by full'buses. But since these passen-&#13;
gers apparently wait for a stage bus and decline the offer of the mini-&#13;
buses, one may presume that their value of time is very low indeed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
service would be expected to entice the erstwhile or incipient motorist, thus&#13;
reducing congestion. And since they carried about as many passenger miles as&#13;
the large bus, with a rated congestion effect of only half the bus per mile,&#13;
it seems that the net effect on congestion may be expected to be favorable.&#13;
Unfortunately, it is impossible to collect information which would confirm or&#13;
deny this proposition. While it is true that congestion seems superficially&#13;
to be certainly no worse than during the earlier days, there have been many&#13;
other changes during this period (emergence from a slump, considerable imped-&#13;
ing road works, an expansion of the private car fleet, etc.) which have&#13;
prevented attribution of the effects to causes.&#13;
2.30      Fifth, there are externalities such as the "creation of jobs"--&#13;
whatever that much overworked term may be taken to mean. Compared with the&#13;
standard bus, the minibus is a labor-intensive form of transit and substitutes&#13;
labor for capital. (Often the minibus operators find it efficient to carry a&#13;
fare collector who, one suspects, is usually a member of the family.) Further-&#13;
more, the maintenance services of minibuses require less capital and can be&#13;
performed by "shade tree" mechanics. Thus it seems likely that the minibuses&#13;
provide more "productive" jobs in the private unregulatd sector than the&#13;
simple stage bus system. It is also important to note that the employment is&#13;
in the non-unionized sector, as distinct from the stage bus industry which is&#13;
largely unionized, and furthermore, the minibuses provide an outlet for entre-&#13;
preneurship on a small scale. The enterprising man who has a small amount of&#13;
capital can enter the minibus business. Capital and ownership are spread&#13;
throughout the population (and in particular the Malay population) rather than&#13;
being concentrated in few hands. It would be interesting to know the income-&#13;
employment characteristics of those who use minibuses, but unfortunately, no&#13;
information is available.&#13;
2.31      It might be noted that it is difficult to disentangle the various&#13;
elements that have contributed to this surprisingly large benefit of over&#13;
US$10 million annually. One would suspect that much of it is due to the&#13;
owner-driver form of incentives that induces the minibus operator to seek&#13;
diligently where demand is high and to prune his costs to the unavoidable&#13;
ones. 1/ Some part of the value is probably due to the technology of the&#13;
smaller bus. But all this is conjecture. One may also speculate on what&#13;
would be the result of allowing free entry into the minibus business. It is&#13;
likely that minibuses would take over the majority of trips in Kuala Lumpur.&#13;
And this would be in spite of the fact that Kuala Lumpur has, by any normal&#13;
international standards, an efficient and cheap system of stage buses.&#13;
1/ In the Bank appraisal the minibuses were expected to carry approximately&#13;
half the number of passengers they actually 'achieved.  This forecast was&#13;
done on the best assumptions of transport experts. But like the bumble&#13;
bee ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
D. Conclusions on Policy&#13;
2.32      The conclusion is that the introduction of minibuses produced an&#13;
extraordinarily large benefit for both operators and passengers--a benefit&#13;
which they shared more or less equally. The annual benefit is the equivalent&#13;
of about a one percent increase in income for every adult in Kuala Lumpur, or&#13;
about US$18 per capita. The constraint on the number of minibus licenses&#13;
combined with the relatively high regulated fare gave rise to very high load&#13;
factors and substantial profits for operators. With free entry, the fare&#13;
would probably fall more than 40X, and it is likely that the minibus would be&#13;
the predominant form of urban transport.&#13;
2.33      As could be expected with the flat rate regulated fare on minibuses,&#13;
they have captured many of the long distance trips and left the stage bus&#13;
with the shorter trips. This is the opposite of the normal role assigned&#13;
to minibuses. One would conjecture that the greater frequency of minibuses&#13;
could be relatively most advantageous on short trips. In other cities, such&#13;
as Manila (Philippines), the minibuses ("jeepneys") concentrate at the short&#13;
end of the urban travel market. But there both buses and minibuses have the&#13;
same flat rate fare structure. So it appears that the more appropriate role&#13;
of minibuses in carrying short distance passengers is inhibited, or indeed&#13;
largely precluded by the fare structure imposed by the regulators. They have&#13;
been induced into the long hauls where the relative advantage is less. It is&#13;
some sort of testimony to the virility and adaptability of the mini business&#13;
that the minibuses have, nevertheless, much higher net benefits.&#13;
2.34      An obvious subject for further speculation is the deregulation&#13;
of both fares and quantity restrictions in the urban transport business.&#13;
The outline of the results of such a policy change is easy to see, but it is&#13;
beyond the scope of this paper.&#13;
2.35      Kuala Lumpur was in no way a sitting duck for the minibuses.  The&#13;
stage buses were relatively frequent, ubiquitous and cheap, yet marginally&#13;
profitable. Similarly, the taxi service was not tightly constrained and&#13;
fares were low. This suggests that the benefits were not due to the special&#13;
circumstances pertaining in Kuala Lumpur. One may thus expect that similar&#13;
acts of deregulation in other cities may produce benefits of a similar or even&#13;
greater magnitude. 1/ One of the unique features of Kuala Lumpur is that the&#13;
introduction of minibuses was achieved quickly in one large operation. Such a&#13;
process is rare; governments usually like to proceed cautiously. And this&#13;
often sets up sufficient resistance to stifle further deregulation. Herein is&#13;
a lesson for reformers.&#13;

Belfast, Bangkok and Hong Kong is to be found in pars. 1.58-1.66.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
COSTS AND SIZES OF BUSES&#13;
1.        It may appear to be obvious that the capital cost per seat of a&#13;
large bus is less than that of a small vehicle since one is "spreading," for&#13;
example, engine and transmission costs over a larger carrying capacity. But&#13;
this is not the case. A casual inspection of prices will show that this is&#13;
not so. Compare two extremes:  The American 5-passenger-plus-driver auto-&#13;
mobile and the standard AM 51-seat-plus-26-standees bus. The automobile, air&#13;
conditioned and appropriately fitted, would cost about $4,200 for a fleet&#13;
purchaser. From recent contracts it appears that the bus, appropriately&#13;
fitted, would cost nearly $100,000. Thus the cost per seat of the automobile&#13;
is $840 compared with $1,960 for the bus. Even if one adds the standing&#13;
passenger places, the cost per passenger place is $1,300. (One should also&#13;
take into account the differences in length of life and in maintenance costs&#13;
before comparing the annual capital costs.)&#13;
2.        The reason for the relative cheapness of the small vehicle is that&#13;
they are produced in great volume, and most of the great productivity gains&#13;
over the last half century have been due to mass production and line tech-&#13;
niques. The bus, on the other hand, is produced by a low-volume batch process.&#13;
The above comparison understates the difference in capital costs per passenger&#13;
place, since the standard automobile does not attempt to maximize its carrying&#13;
capacity. If one adapted a small van carrying 10-12 passengers, the fleet&#13;
cost would be on the order of $8,000--which would give an even lower cost per&#13;
seat of $666.&#13;
3.        These comparisons cover extremes.  The more normal range of bus&#13;
sizes 1/ was examined for 24 fleet purchases for cities in the United States&#13;
between 1965 and 1970. 2/ This showed that the formula for the price of a&#13;
bus was given by:&#13;
$ Price of bus = $29,000 + $1,000 (S-45)&#13;
with S seats&#13;
(for price of buses from $24,000 to $33,000)&#13;
where S is the number of seats&#13;
1/   Note, however, that we have not examined the articulated bus such as&#13;
the NEOPLAN articulated transit bus. In March 1975 this was quoted at&#13;
$124,378 for 77 seats, 43 standing. It will be seen to be consistent&#13;
with the American model.&#13;

4.        Although the authors do not mention it, this equation can be true&#13;
only over a certain range (e.g., certainly excluding S&lt;161). The $1,000 a&#13;
seat for capacity above 45 seats is indicative of diseconomies of scale--but&#13;
it probably is numerically an exaggeration since the authors note that the&#13;
larger the bus the more likely it has optional extras such as air conditioning&#13;
and power steering. From a survey of the price lists, as distinct from fleet&#13;
prices, it seems that an additional seat tends to add on the average about&#13;
$800--but that is a rough figure.&#13;
5.        Probably the only certain inference we can draw is that there is no&#13;
evidence of scale economies of capital costs in large buses.  The evidence&#13;
indeed suggests that- there are pronounced diseconomies after a rather small&#13;
size.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
COSTS OF BUS AND MINIBUS&#13;
1.        It is extraordinarily difficult to assemble data on costs of both&#13;
buses and minibuses on a comparable basis; the paucity of data is particularly&#13;
acute in the case of the minibuses. Much published material on minibus costs&#13;
is not the result of observation of going concerns. Some is "synthesized"&#13;
(fabricated would be a more appropriate verb from supposed operating charac-&#13;
teristics and unit costs. In many of the exercises the object seems to be to&#13;
show that minibuses are uneconomic compared with the stage bus--and could not&#13;
conceivably be profitable. As Amos pointed out, however, it is rather like&#13;
engineers proving that a bumble bee cannot fly. And so running minibus&#13;
operations according to the rules and conventions of the large stage bus&#13;
monopolies would certainly lead to financial ruin. In practice the mini-&#13;
operations are different from stage-bus practices--as can be observed in&#13;
the jeepneys in Manila (Table 1), the public light bus in Hong Kong (Table&#13;
2), and the minibuses in Kuala Lumpur (Annex 3),--even though they cater for&#13;
a similar demand.&#13;
2.        In many examples, among them Hong Kong, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur and&#13;
Manila, the size and type of minibus is mandated by the authorities (pars.&#13;
1.58-1.63). The vehicle must conform to regulatory specifications (par.&#13;
1.68). There is every reason to suppose that a single specification of&#13;
vehicle, especially if it is produced by a regulatory authority, is unlikely&#13;
to be best for all services. For example, it is highly likely that there is a&#13;
large latent demand for the services of a much lighter bus (such as the VW van&#13;
with 10-12 seats) with lower comfort but lower fares in both Hong Kong and&#13;
Kuala Lumpur. The minibus is not the result of the free choice of the market,&#13;
except in the case of Honduras (Tegucigalpa)(par. 1.55). Similarly in Istanbul&#13;
(par. 1.66), Kuala Lumpur (par. 1.64) and in Manila fares are controlled&#13;
which gives rise to a particular form of operation. In sum, one can never&#13;
observe like against like operations and consequently there will always be&#13;
room for interpretation.&#13;
3.        The costs of minibus operations, therefore, are likely to have an&#13;
upward bias because: (a) the standard comparison is with the typical stage bus&#13;
and its operational characteristics; and (b) the lack of data are more pronoun-&#13;
ced in the case of minibuses so that the analyst fills in with conservative&#13;
assumptions. An illustration of this is the proposition that public light&#13;
buses have a life of 5 years compared with the stage buses that have a life of&#13;
12 years. In the study no one could observe the life of minibuses and it is&#13;
clear that 5 years is a short period. (Evidence on this appears in Turkey&#13;
where, in Ankara and Istanbul, one may observe minibuses--or dolmus--which are&#13;
American cars of the 1940-50s. Transport experts argue that, especially in&#13;
view of the paucity of spare parts, such long lives are clearly uneconomic;&#13;
but I am not persuaded that so many vehicle owners do not know their own&#13;
interests better than the experts.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Manila&#13;
4.        For only one city, Manila, have we data that are closely comparable&#13;
for both bus and minibus--that is the jeepney. Table I compares the cost per&#13;
mile and the cost per seat mile of the standard stage bus and the standard&#13;
jeepney. The sources of these data are mixed; to some extent they are from&#13;
survey material (this applies to the mileage) of a fairly reliable nature, and&#13;
to some extent it relies on the best estimates of experts (this applies to&#13;
tires, fuel consumption, lubricants and maintenance).&#13;
5.        The first striking feature is that the annual depreciation and&#13;
interest cost of the seat-mile of the jeepney is only about 40% of the compar-&#13;
able figure for the bus seat-mile. This emphasizes the low capitalization of&#13;
the mini-operation. These low capital costs of the jeepney are to some extent&#13;
offset by the higher operating costs--particularly in fuel and lubricants.&#13;
It is indeed astonishing to find that the costs per mile of the lightweight&#13;
Jeepney are only about 20Z less than the heavy bus; it seems that fuel costs&#13;
are about 62% of non-wage operating costs of jeepneys. However, substantial&#13;
taxes were imposed (10% on diesel and 38% on gasoline); when these are&#13;
extracted, the fuel cost of the jeepney is about one-half that of the bus&#13;
(2.784 cents a mile compared with 4.950). 1/&#13;
6.        It will be seen that, in the totals, the cost, inclusive of taxes&#13;
but excluding wages-of the jeepney per seat mile is almost the same as the&#13;
cost per seat mile of the bus.-- The difference between them of .045 cents, or&#13;
about 9%, is well within the errors of calculation of such figures.  If,&#13;
however, the fuel tax is extracted, then the cost per seat mile of the jeepney&#13;
falls--perhaps significantly-below the cost of the bus--.4 cents compared&#13;
with .465 cents, a difference of about 16%. 2/ Finally, consistent with the&#13;
remarks made in par. 3 above, it will be noted that this comparison is loaded&#13;
against the jeepney in many respects. We list only two: (a) it is likely&#13;
that there is less dead head running of jeepneys than buses and that the&#13;
effective mileage of the jeepneys is greater than the figures given; (b) it is&#13;
less than those of the large buses (they have been assumed equal in the&#13;
comparison).&#13;
1/ There are still good reasons for supposing that the physical fuel&#13;
consumption of jeepneys has been overstated in these figures.&#13;
2/ In principle one should also subtract the vehicle duties to get the&#13;
depreciation and other capital-related costs free from tax. However,&#13;
the adjustments are trivial compared to the fuel duty and hardly&#13;
affect the comparison.&#13;

Note: Bus: 58 seats; Jeepney: 14 seats.&#13;
/a   Depreciation estimates are based on a capital cost of US$30,666 for&#13;
a 55-seat stage bus with an expected 10-year life. The jeepney costs&#13;
US$2,972 for a 14-seat vehicle lasting on average 7.5 years. Buses&#13;
average 46,500 miles/year; jeepneys 50,000 miles. It is worth noting&#13;
that the capital cost per seat mile of a bus is about 2 1/2 times that of&#13;
a jeepney. 75% of depreciation cost is treated as dependent on the&#13;
distance traveled, with the remaining 25% determined by time in use.&#13;
/b   Maintenance costs for the two vehicle types are proportionate:  300 hours&#13;
of labor time, and parts cost estimated at 10% of vehicle cost.&#13;
/c   Wage costs of jeepneys and bus differ in wage rates paid and size of crew&#13;
employed. A bus operates with a driver (@ P 5/hr.) and conductor&#13;
(@P 4/hr.) Jeepneys employ only a drive @ P 2.5/hr.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
7.        It will also be noted that the labor costs of the jeepney are&#13;
about one-third of those of the bus. This is partly because the jeepneys&#13;
do not employ a separate fare collector and partly because bus drivers&#13;
are LiEought to be more highly skilled (and of course they are unionized).&#13;
3.        The fares are controlled at the same values for both jeepneys and&#13;
buses. ie., P 0.25 for first km or US$0.033 for first 3.1 miles; and P 0.05&#13;
for each additional km or US$0.0096 each additional mile. At these fares,&#13;
the buses appear to have considerable difficulty in meeting their costs, but&#13;
the jeepneys manage to earn what many observers regard as adequate or sub-&#13;
stantial profits. One of the explanations is thought to be that the average&#13;
Jeepney Journey is considerably shorter than the average bus journey. Al-&#13;
though there is some doubt about these statistics on journey length, if true&#13;
it would be consistent with the jeepneys charging more for their superior&#13;
service.&#13;
Calculating m ( R ) = a + b x   for Manila:&#13;
The wage costs per mile of a bus and jeepney are respectively 9.6 and 3.4 US&#13;
cents, and these correspond to 58- and 14-seat vehicles respectively. Fitting&#13;
a linear relationship to these points gives a slope of 0.141 cents a seat, and&#13;
an intercept of 1.42 cents. Thus if x is the number of seats per vehicle and&#13;
y is the wage cost (in U.S. cents) per mile per vehicle&#13;
y = 1.42 + 0.141 x&#13;
Divide x by 58 to giveA  , and suitably standardizing the intercept, one&#13;
obtains&#13;
m = 0.148 + 0.852g&#13;
Hong Kong&#13;
9.        There are fairly reliable data on the public light buses (PLBs) but&#13;
only for 1972. The first striking feature in comparison with the Manila figures&#13;
is the small value for depreciation per seat mile (including interest charges)&#13;
compared with the jeepney, i.e., US$0.16 in Hong Kong and M$0.092 in Manila.&#13;
This reflects the sturdier nature of the PLB and the fact that it was designed&#13;
as a minibus; it is also misleading to calculate the comparison per seat since&#13;
the PLB has much more potential for standing passengers than the jeepney. (One&#13;
interesting comparison is that the cost of fuel per seat mile for the PLB is&#13;
only about 60% of the cost of fuel for the jeepney.)&#13;
10.       The costs, excluding wages per seat mile are 0.711 US cents in Hong&#13;
Kong compared with 0.519 for the jeepneys in Manila. Whether this difference&#13;
in costs measures the difference in comfort and standing capacity is a matter&#13;
which can be pursued no further here. It is clear, however, that the two&#13;
costs are broadly comparable or at least not dramatically inconsistent.&#13;

11.       In San Jose (Costa Rica) and in Kuala Lumpur there are fairly good&#13;
data on stage bus operation, but none on minibus costs. These are broadly&#13;
consistent with the Manila figures; thus in 1974, the cost per seat mile of&#13;
the 50-seat bus in San Jose was 0.557 US cents, and in Kuala Lumpur the&#13;
44-seat bus cost 0.69 US cents in 1976. Allowing for inflation, these&#13;
values are virtually the same and are within 10% of the values for Manila.&#13;

gers from the assumed 7 to a figure probably nearer to 14 for the one (8 hour)&#13;
shift. 1/&#13;
3.        If we suppose that the only change from the data shown in par. 1 is&#13;
the doubling of the average load from 7 to 14 passengers, the approximate&#13;
result would be a doubling of annual revenue--from M$25,200 to M$50,400.&#13;
Subtracting total expenditure of M$17,300 from this, we obtain a profit of&#13;
M$33,100.&#13;
4.        This represents a more than 100% rate of profit on the investment&#13;
of M$32,000. And clearly this is a lower bond because we have not yet taken&#13;
into account the additional 80 passenger (500-420) trips a day which, on the&#13;
average, minibuses achieve--which would bring in a yearly revenue of M$9,600.&#13;
If variable costs increased proportionately, i.e., (80/420) x 2,000, this&#13;
would give an additional cost of M$381--giving an additional net revenue&#13;
of M$9,219. Thus the best estimate of total annual profit is M$33,100 +&#13;
M$9,219 or approximately M$42,000. This represents a rate of return on&#13;
capital of over 130%.&#13;
5.        Clearly these rates of profit in a business such as minibus operation&#13;
far exceed "normal" values. "Normal" profits in regulated urban passenger&#13;
transport are often calculated at 15-18% of revenues--which would give about&#13;
12-14% return on investment. The appraisal report concluded that the return&#13;
would be about 31% of revenues and 25% on investment--and these rates were&#13;
clearly regarded as greater than normal.&#13;
6.        From all this discussion it appears that excess profits (over and&#13;
above normal profits) are at least 100% of capital, or approximately M$32,000&#13;
per annum, which implies a normal rate of profit of about 30% on capital.&#13;
This figure was used in the evaluation.&#13;
7.        It will be noted that this figure is broadly consistent with the&#13;
rate of profit on one other similar minibus operation--the public light buses&#13;
in Hong Kong. There it is reported that profit rates are "more than 100%." 2/&#13;
This suggests that, if there are approximately constant costs in the minibus&#13;
industry, then free entry and no fare regulation would result in the competi-&#13;
tive fare of about US$0.21 or US$0.22.&#13;
1/   During the three-hour period 0630-0930, 17.1 passengers were carried and&#13;
for the peak hour over 18 passengers. Thus it is assumed, as the data&#13;
show, that minibuses operate intensively during the peak, the 8-hour&#13;
shift will cover both peaks with approximately 17 carried during the two&#13;
3-hour peaks and 10 during the two off-peak hours.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper challenges the conventional
            wisdom that large buses in large organizations with
            subsidies to produce optimum frequencies are the best
            arrangement for urban road passenger transport. It is shown
            that in theory small buses are often appropriate, giving the
            best frequencies and speeds and suitably low average
            passenger waiting times. Direct observations of minibus
            services in a number of cities tentatively demonstrate the
            veracity of the theory. Furthermore the best institutional
            organization is not the large firm or municipal authority,
            but the small firm, often the owner/driver. There is no case
            for any substantial subsidy for appropriately organized
            urban bus transport.
