INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    When the current Government of Nicaragua assumed office in April, 1990 it faced severe&#13;
challenges. The economy, devastated by mismanagement and civil war, was characterized by a&#13;
cumbersome, centralized public sector, a small over-regulated private sector, and atrophied&#13;
market institutions. Exports and GDP per capita had declined to 40 percent of the levels attained&#13;
in the mid 1970s, and macroeconomic imbalances, inherited from the previous administration, had&#13;
resulted in hyper-inflation and a massive external debt more than five times the size of the GDP.&#13;
During 1991 and 1992 the Government implemented a strong stabilization program supported by&#13;
the IMF. It also began a structural adjustment program, supported by IDA, aimed at transforming&#13;
Nicaragua into a market economy capable of achieving sustained growth. An element in the&#13;
structural adjustment effort were programs to fundamentally alter the size and role of Government&#13;
through employment downsizing, privatization of parastatal enterprises, and the reduction of&#13;
Government policy intervention in economic decision making.&#13;
2.    Despite considerable progress in stabilization and adjustment, by early 1994 private sector&#13;
investment and economic activity had not rebounded as anticipated. A major contributing factor&#13;
was the continuing drag on the economy of the public sector. Even after privatizing over 300&#13;
firms, labor force reductions, and major efforts at budget restraint, the non-financial public sector&#13;
remained large, accounting for 40 percent of GDP. Despite a high tax burden, the 1994 fiscal&#13;
current deficit in the non-financ:al public sector, before donations, is about 8 percent of GDP.&#13;
Moreover, service delivery remains weak as public sector financial management processes are&#13;
rudimentary, human resource management is nearly non-existent, and the mission, structure and&#13;
function of individual ministries remains, in many instances, outdated and inadequate.&#13;
3.    The authorities, fully cognizant of these deficiencies and the failure of the economy to&#13;
respond as anticipated to the earlier adjustment measures, embarked on an intensified program of&#13;
adjustment with increased attention directed to public sector reform and modernization. IDA&#13;
supported this initiative with a second Economic Recovery Credit (ERC II), approved in June,&#13;
1994, which aims at, among others: (i) a 15 percent reduction in public employment; (ii)&#13;
continued privatization of public enterprises; (iii) reform of state banking institutions; and (iv) the&#13;
design and launching of a comprehensive public sector modernization program. Preparation of a&#13;
Technical Assistance (TA) project to support reform design began in early 1994. Using both&#13;
PHRD and IDF grants, the Government was able to prepare diagnostic studies and action&#13;
programs focused on institutional restructuring, civil service and financial management reform,&#13;
and the development of an information technology improvement program for the public sector.&#13;
Given the progress achieved in reform design and their strong desire to accelerate reform&#13;
implementation, the authorities requested that the proposed TA credit be expanded into a more&#13;
comprehensive, implementation oriented Institutional Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
4.     Project Objectives: President Violeta Chamorro issued Decree 44-94 in October, 1994&#13;
initiating a public sector modernization program and creating a cabinet level oversight C'ommittee&#13;
for the Reform of the Public Administration (CERAP), headed by the Minister of the Presidency.&#13;
The goal of the reform is a public sector which is "small, strong, efficient.. and [which] acts as a&#13;
facilitator to the private sector." Successful implementation of a comprehensive, coherent, and&#13;
well-targeted public sector modernization program would represent an important advance in&#13;
Nicaragua's ongoing structural adjustment effort. The proposed project would be a major source&#13;
of support for the reform effort. Its objectives would be improvement in service delivery by those&#13;
institutions restructured under the program and increases in public savings attributable to the&#13;
program.&#13;
5.    Project Concept: Institutional restructuring is the heart of the reform program and the&#13;
proposed project. It would involve the systematic re-engineering of up to 20 ministries and&#13;
decentralized institutions over a five year period. Project execution would be phased with no&#13;
more than five institutions joining the program in any given year in order to limit demands on the&#13;
Government's overall reform management capacity. An important degree of "self-selection"&#13;
would be utilized in determining the order of entrance into the program to ensure commitment&#13;
and "buy-in" by the participating institutions.&#13;
6.    IDC financed consultant services would assist CERAP undertake diagnostic studies of the&#13;
mission, structure, and function of institutions nominated to enter the program as well as design&#13;
and support implementation of the institutional restructuring process. Institutional Restructuring&#13;
Agreements (IRAs) would be negotiated between CERAP and each participating institution&#13;
Each IRA would establish objectives and performance benchmarks focused on identifying the&#13;
appropriate mission and enhancing the main service delivery capacities of the participating&#13;
institution, as well as delineating the resources (technical assistance, training, information&#13;
technology, etc. financed by IDA or other donors) to be made available by CERAP to support the&#13;
restructuring process. Each IRA is expected to remain in force for at least two years. Annual&#13;
performance reviews, including Service Delivery Surveys (SDS), being designed with the support&#13;
of the Economic Development Institute (EDI), would measure the institution's progress against&#13;
agreed objectives and establish the basis for any modifications in the IRAs for the following year.&#13;
While the Government is confident that all ministers and heads of institutions would actively&#13;
support the restructuring process, Government sponsored incentives, in addition to those&#13;
provided through IDA and other participating donor resources, would include increased&#13;
responsibility in budget formulation and execution, improved human resource management and&#13;
training, and scope for selective pay adjustments for essential professional and technical personnel&#13;
financed out of reform related savings.&#13;
7.    The project would also finance three critically important cross-cutting components (civil&#13;
service reform, financial management reform, and investments in information technology)&#13;
necessary to sustain improved service delivery in the restructured institutions. These systems&#13;
must be designed as overarching, enabling systems for the public sector as a whole. The&#13;
installation of these components, however, would be targeted first on those institutions with IRAs&#13;
in force. Although not a separate component per se, training would be an integral aspect of the&#13;
reform effort, to be delivered initially by the substantive consultants in each project component.&#13;
The project would also implicitly complement the Government's decentralization efforts by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
providing training to local officials and supporting, through the restructuring process, the&#13;
expansion of decentralization initiatives currently being piloted in several institutions.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
Institutional Restructuring ($7.05 million, including training, 22% of total base costs):&#13;
8.    The Problem: Diagnostic studies' of seven ministries, two decentralized institutions, and&#13;
five local governments commissioned by IDA during project preparation, as well as a separate&#13;
assessment of pay and employment practices, have documented a generic set of institutional&#13;
weaknesses in the public sector. Among the salient findings are the following:&#13;
* Most ministries, especially those whose controlling legislation sets multiple objectives, are not&#13;
fulfilling their stated missions nor ensuring that their activities fully reflect current Government&#13;
priorities;&#13;
* Confusion and fragmentation of responsibilities is common due to overlapping legal mandates&#13;
among institutions;&#13;
*  Various services could be provided more productively by the private sector,&#13;
* Within institutions there is organizational confusion and fragmentation. Some ministries have&#13;
more than one organization chart, of which none reflects reality;&#13;
* Departments within ministries frequently operate with excessive autonomy, pursuing&#13;
independent agendas,&#13;
* Weak mechanisms for target setting and performance measurement, the poor state of&#13;
information systems, and the lack of feedback into the budgetary process in all institutions&#13;
studied attenuate performance and accountability,&#13;
* The high proportion of donor funding to total resources available to some ministries increases&#13;
the influence of donors' interests and objectives, which may diverge with those of the&#13;
government, heightening confusion and fragmentation of purpose;&#13;
* Ministries appear to be overstaffed at the top and bottom, and&#13;
* Across ministries there are large numbers of small "management units" whose existence&#13;
appears to respond to pressures other than rational work organization. Out of 20 institutions&#13;
studied, 12 had an average of less than four employees per manager. One ministry has 17&#13;
administrative units in its Central Activities Program, of which two have an average of 25.5&#13;
employees, while the other fifteen average only 3.01 employees per unit. Another ministry has&#13;
three units averaging 20.3 persons and 19 averaging 2.07 persons. Whether or not this&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
pattern also reflects the impact of separate donor projects and ad hoc attempts to overcome&#13;
low pay levels, there appears to be too many supervisors for too few employees.&#13;
9.    As indicated above, the Government has pursued public sector reform and downsizing&#13;
since assuming office in 1990. It has reduced public sector intervention in the market,&#13;
demobilized much of the military, privatized over 300 parastatal companies, and initiated sector&#13;
programs with important institutional development components utilizing assistance of IDA, IDB,&#13;
and USAID in the agriculture, health, and education sectors. The Government also implemented&#13;
a voluntary labor force reduction program between 1991 and 1993, financed by USAID, which&#13;
resulted in the separation of approximately 25,000 employees. The combined impact of these and&#13;
other initiatives is demonstrated in Table l.&#13;

10.   In spite of the substantial progress made in reducing the size of the public sector, the 1994&#13;
ratio of GDP per employee is still only about a fourth of its 1977 level. Similarly, the ratio of&#13;
total population to the public sector as a whole, less defense and security, dropped from 98.1&#13;
persons per public servant in 1977 to 63.5 in 1990, recovering to 76.9 by April 1994. While these&#13;
figures must be used with caution and recognition accorded to an increased commitment to social&#13;
sector investments, the analysis suggests further global reductions are warranted within the&#13;
context of carefully prepared institutional restructuring programs.&#13;
11.   The Government's Program: In a Public Sector Management Development Policy letter&#13;
to IDA in March, 1994 the Government indicated its intention to consolidate past reforms and&#13;
launch a more comprehensive public sector modernization program. A Government white paper&#13;
in July, 1994 identified institutional restructuring as the keystone of the reform program. The&#13;
Government subsequently advanced the concept of explicit contractual agreements (i.e., IRAs)&#13;
between CERAP and participating institutions to govern and discipline the institutional&#13;
restructuring process. During project appraisal the Government and IDA agreed on a model, or&#13;
generic, IRA (see Annex 1). CERAP, with IDA assistance, is presently developing the initial four&#13;
IRAs which would serve to launch the institutional restructuring program no latter than mid 1995.&#13;
The authorities and IDA have agreed that at least one IRA would be formally contracted prior to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
credit effectiveness. Assurances were provided by the authorities that IRAs would be negotiated&#13;
between CERAP and participating institutions as a condition for entrance into the program.&#13;
12.   Institutional restructurings would be based on diagnostic reviews of the mission, structure,&#13;
and function of the institution, with a view toward eliminating duplication and fragmentation,&#13;
contracting out or privatizing functions wherever appropriate, strengthening program formulation,&#13;
human resources capacity, and financial management and, in general, strengthening the&#13;
institution's ability to execute a well defined, service oriented mission. The Government has&#13;
nominated the ministries of Finance, Government, Environment and Natural Resources,&#13;
Transportation and Construction, and the Social Security Institute to initiate the restructuring&#13;
process during 1995. Diagnostic studies have been, or will soon be, completed in all these&#13;
institutions. An additional five institutions would join the program during 1996. Diagnostic&#13;
studies to prepare for these and subsequent restructurings would be carried out with IDA financed&#13;
assistance. Subject to the progress achieved in the initial ten institutions, the availability of funds&#13;
and the Government's ability to manage program expansion in a systematic and efficient manner,&#13;
up to 20 institutions could be restructured during the five year life-of-project (see Table 2). The&#13;
Government and IDA have agreed to undertake a mid-term review of the program after the&#13;
project's second year. A central concern of this review would be to determine if the third and&#13;
fourth rounds, each respectively involving up to five institutions, should go forward as indicatively&#13;
planned or, alternatively whether the available resources should be used to further deepen and&#13;
extend the institutional restructuring process underway in the initial 10 IRA institutions for an&#13;
additional one or two years. Both the authorities and IDA agreed during appraisal that a&#13;
decision to continue to expand institutional coverage during the project's outer years, versus a&#13;
more intensively focused, institutional deepening of the ongoing program, could not be decided a&#13;
priori, but should await the results of the mid-term review.&#13;

13.   Proposed IDA Assistance ($5.7 million in Technical Assistance and $.26 million for&#13;
Training): IDA would finance a competitively awarded, two-year renewable contract with a firm&#13;
with relevant international experience. The firm would: (i) assist the CERAP Commission for&#13;
Administrative Reform establish and operate the IRA process, (ii) provide direct technical&#13;
assistance (both management and sector specific) to the selected institutions implementing IRAs,&#13;
(iii) design and carry out diagnostic studies for prospective restructuring institutions; (iv) assist&#13;
and support CERAP in its effort to establish and implement the SDS; (v) assist CERAP carry out&#13;
the annual IRA performance reviews, (vi) provide selected professional expertise to support&#13;
relevant training programs, (vii) assist CERAP establish the overall management framework and&#13;
implement the Public Sector Modernization Program, and (viii) oversee the coordination of the&#13;
contractors responsible for providing technical assistance to the other components of the&#13;
program. The proposed consulting services are expected to be about 144-person months of long&#13;
term residential assistance and 124 person-months of short term advisory support. Additionally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
this component would cover management training activities to be designed and initially&#13;
implemented by the technical assistance contractor and subsequently replicated and extended by&#13;
[NAP to participating institutions.&#13;
14.   Expected Outputs: The expected outputs of the Institutional Restructuring component&#13;
would be: (i) enhanced service delivery by participating institutions as recorded and measured&#13;
through annual service delivery surveys and institutional performance reviews to be carried out&#13;
by CERAP; and (ii) more rational and cost effective recurrent and capital expenditures at the&#13;
individual institutional level, expressed in terms of each participating institution's contribution to&#13;
public savings.&#13;
Civil Service Reform ($3.34 million, including training, 10% of total base costs):&#13;
15.   The Problem: Improvements in institutional performance will require complementary&#13;
reforms in several areas including the civil service system. A comprehensive diagnosis2&#13;
undertaken during project preparation identified a range of legal, institutional, and policy&#13;
weaknesses in managing human resources, including the following:&#13;
*  Public sector employment in Nicaragua has never been governed by a civil service code. The&#13;
Government vetoed civil service legislation passed by the outgoing administration, believing&#13;
that it would not establish an appropriate framework for a professional and merit based civil&#13;
service;&#13;
* There is no national establishment register with a file on each employee, no job classification&#13;
system, no government-wide occupational based salary schedule, and no uniform set of&#13;
policies and procedures guided by a central personnel agency,&#13;
* The policy framework for the functioning of the civil service is based on custom and tradition,&#13;
augmented by separate laws and individual collective bargaining agreements negotiated at the&#13;
ministry level,&#13;
* Ministries often have separate and distinct codes which govern human resource management.&#13;
Consequently pay, grievance procedures, medical benefits, occupational injury regulations,&#13;
leave, death and severance benefits, and fringe benefits relating to food and clothing vary&#13;
widely among institutions. Staff in some ministries work a five-hour day for eight-hours pay.&#13;
Some agreements give employees the right to strike. Although many agreements have not&#13;
been renegotiated upon expiration, they continue in force;&#13;
* Personnel administration is rudimentary within each institution. Recruitment, hiring, firing,&#13;
and promotion are generally handled outside of the personnel division, without uniform&#13;
institutional standards and procedures. Performance evaluation, except during a probationary&#13;
period at the onset of employment, does not exist;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
*  Training opportunities for staff at all levels is extremely limited. Much of the training that&#13;
exists is initiated and financed by international donors as ad hoc interventions rather than part&#13;
of a coherent public sector human resource management and career enhancement program;&#13;
*  Management style tends to be authoritarian rather than consultative, motivating, and directed&#13;
toward problem solving;&#13;
*  Although there is limited data, civil service pay appears to be substantially below that of the&#13;
private sector across all occupational classifications, especially for technicians and senior&#13;
managers. Average earnings in government were 791 Cordobas/month ($115 equivalent) in&#13;
1993 versus 1,600 Cordobas/month ($229 equivalent) in the private sector (see Table 3);&#13;

* There appears to be a wide range of salaries for similar occupational classifications within the&#13;
public sector, reflecting the absence of any formal wage structure for the government and&#13;
misclassification of individuals as a result of weak personnel administration (see Table 4);&#13;

-  Ad hoc arrangements to overcome low pay through donor financing of Nicaraguan&#13;
consultants associated with donor financed projects may be unsustainable if international&#13;
assistance diminishes and the consultants abandon the public sector. One ministry has 425&#13;
regular positions and 555 Nicaraguan consultants associated with 27 donor financed projects.&#13;
These consultants are paid on average twice the prevailing rate for the corresponding&#13;
occupational categories on the government payroll, and&#13;
-  The ongoing program to reduce public employment under the Government's "Labor Mobility&#13;
Program" should be strengthened by tightening controls over new hiring, ensuring that&#13;
departing employees are not the most productive, linking reductions to institutional priorities&#13;
and restructuring goals, and permitting institutions to share in the budgetary savings achieved,&#13;
perhaps to provide program support and performance incentive payments to the remaining&#13;
work force. The latter would be facilitated were donors to contribute to a severance payment&#13;
fund, to relieve the pressure on the Government's recurrent budget which is currently&#13;
financing severance payments.&#13;
16.   The Government's Program: Given the serious macroeconomic imbalances and&#13;
precarious fiscal position inherited by the Government in 1990, its immediate objective was to&#13;
reduce the fiscal impact of an excessively large public sector labor force. This was achieved,&#13;
although some of the Government's more able civil servants left (perhaps inevitably given&#13;
improving prospects in the private sector). While still pursuing more selective downsizing under a&#13;
second phase Labor Mobility Program (to be supported by diagnostic reviews under the project),&#13;
the Government wants to create a properly structured, better compensated, and more professional&#13;
core of human resources in the public sector. To this end, the Government recently created,&#13;
within the Ministry of Finance, a Directorate General for Public Functions (DIGEFUP), which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
will serve as a nascent Civil Service Administration and which has initiated a job evaluation and&#13;
position classification effort. The Government recently created personnel divisions in line&#13;
ministries and decentralized agencies which presently perform only a minimal set of personnel&#13;
management functions, principally preparation of payroll submissions and recording changes in&#13;
employee status. It is the Government's intention to enhance salaries for scarce technical and&#13;
professional skills in certain occupational categories, perhaps through the creation of a new civil&#13;
service cadre. Given immediate fiscal constraints, and as DIGEFUP seeks to define such a&#13;
system, the Government would permit participating spending agency ministers to utilize a portion&#13;
of budgetary savings generated through the restructuring process for selective pay adjustments.&#13;
Finally, with support from UNDP and USAID, the Government has taken initial steps to develop&#13;
targeted short-term management training programs, and has moved to strengthen the public&#13;
sector's training capacity in INAP.&#13;
17.   Proposed IDA Assistance ($3.0 million in Technical Assistance and $34 million for&#13;
Training): IDA would finance a competitively awarded, two-year renewable contract with a firm&#13;
specialized in human resources management and with relevant international experience to assist&#13;
the Civil Service Commission and the DIGEFUP design and carry out the civil service&#13;
modernization program. The level of effort of this proposed consultant services contract is&#13;
expected to be in the range of 96 person months of long-term residential assistance and 26&#13;
person-months of short term advisory support. Three types of assistance are envisaged:&#13;
* The contractor would assist the Civil Service Commission and DIGEFUP: (i) draft, and&#13;
implement upon enactment, a merit based civil service code3; (ii) develop a standard set of&#13;
regulations to implement the civil service code, covering all aspects of personnel&#13;
administration from grievance procedures to performance evaluation; (iii) further develop and&#13;
maintain a government-wide job classification system and supporting computerized&#13;
establishment register; (iv) develop a service-wide, incentive based salary structure and the&#13;
capacity to periodically update the salary schedule through labor market wage surveys; (v)&#13;
design and carry-out targeted staff reductions arising from the institutional diagnosis and&#13;
restructuring process; (vi) develop and apply appropriate recruitment and staff selection&#13;
processes, and (vii) strengthen the capacity of DIGEFUP to meet its responsibilities as the&#13;
rector of the civil service system.&#13;
*  At the individual institutional level, the contractor with DIGEFUP would provide technical&#13;
assistance, as elaborated in each IRA, to assist the institution's personnel divisions upgrade&#13;
personnel management practices and implement the new civil service code.&#13;
* The contractor would assist DIGEFUP design and carry out a core program of training in&#13;
human resources management (estimated cost $0.34 million). The contractor would also&#13;
coordinate the training activities associated with the Institutional Restructuring, Integrated&#13;
Financial Management and Information Technology components (see paras. 13, 21 and 26).&#13;
3  It is the Government's intention to send the proposed civil service legislation to the National Assembly for&#13;
debate and approval. The Executive Branch, however, has independent authority to establish, through&#13;
presidential decree, the necessary legal framework for the creation of the proposed civil service in the event&#13;
that the legislation is not passed by the Assembly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
This training would be initially developed and delivered by the consultants retained under&#13;
those components and subsequently replicated and expanded by INAP. The overall IDA&#13;
contribution to training, across all five project components, would total $2.0 million (see&#13;
Schedule 2). The UNDP would provide assistance to INAP, in the context of its ongoing&#13;
capacity building program, in training management, finance, and logistics.&#13;
18.   Expected Outputs: This component would help establish the legal foundation and&#13;
supporting management framework at both the central and specific agency level for a modern civil&#13;
service. Personnel administration and merit principles would be introduced across the&#13;
Government. A single job classification system, computerized establishment register and&#13;
supporting salary schedule would be fully functional, enabling the government to effectively&#13;
control and manage public employment and maintain an occupation based salary schedule.&#13;
Administrators and staff would receive training in applying the newly acquired personnel&#13;
management procedures. Moreover, a large cross section of civil servants would have received&#13;
training in general management, financial management and information technology, and the&#13;
institutional capability of INAP to sustain this training effort would have been strengthened.&#13;
Integrated Financial Management ($11.16 million, including training, 34% of total costs):&#13;
19.   The Problem: The financial management system of the public sector is poor and&#13;
constrains the Government's ability to execute its policies and programs in a cost effective,&#13;
efficient, and transparent manner. Diagnostic studies prepared by USAID and IDA4 have&#13;
revealed:&#13;
&#149; The absence of a government-wide accounting system to comprehensively standardize,&#13;
classify, and account for public revenues and expenditures;&#13;
* Weak expenditure controls and cash flow management practices and supporting Treasury&#13;
functions"&#13;
* An institutionally fragmented and only partially developed system to manage and control&#13;
public credit;&#13;
* A cumbersome procurement system;&#13;
* No linkage between the rudimentary personnel establishment register and the budget and&#13;
expenditure control process; and&#13;
* A weak and limited ex post audit capacity.&#13;
20.   A diagnostic study of the budget sub-system prepared for the project5 revealed that the&#13;
budget process, notwithstanding significant progress made by the present administration, is&#13;
Nicaragua Financial Mana-gement and Control Project, December, 1994&#13;
Nicaragua: FRMP Budget System Implementation Plan, July, 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
rudimentary and subordinate to short-term cash management priorities. The formal budget&#13;
process is limited to marginal adjustments from the previous year's base rather than analysis of&#13;
past expenditures, performance assessments, or forward planning. As the Government's fiscal&#13;
position is extremely tight and subject to fluctuation, which is especially unpredictable in the&#13;
absence of a cash flow plan, the Ministry of Finance exercises monthly cash control. This has&#13;
proved successful in terms of maintaining macro-fiscal targets, but at the cost of micro-service&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness at the spending agency level. As a consequence, spending agency&#13;
budgeting is a short term, monthly activity which bears little relation to the formal budgets&#13;
advanced during the formulation stage. The system of internal audit in each ministry is also&#13;
inadequate. Units, which under law report to agency heads, in practice report to the Comptroller&#13;
General, frequently perform ex ante control, and do not provide timely information or support to&#13;
the affected minister.&#13;
21.   The Government's Program: The Government is taking actions to strengthen the public&#13;
sector financial management system and increase its integrity, Budget reforms identified in the&#13;
diagnostic work are improving short-term revenue and expenditure forecasting, increasing the&#13;
transparency of the budget document, establishing a new budget classification system, as well as&#13;
initiating measures to improve expenditure control. More broadly, the Government is undertaking&#13;
a comprehensive reform of its financial management system. Under the joint policy leadership of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance and the Comptroller General, the Integrated Financial Management&#13;
System (SIGFA) would seek to establish the concept and policy of operational decentralization of&#13;
authority and responsibility for financial management to individual spending units anchored by a&#13;
uniform and automated accounting system. The Government has secured assistance from several&#13;
donors to support discrete sub-components of the SIGFA system. USAID has committed $4.4&#13;
million to develop the accounting system and strengthen the audit capacity of the Office of the&#13;
Comptroller General. The UNDP is expected to approve $0.9 million for general capacity&#13;
building within the Comptroller General's office. The IDB has committed $1.5 million to further&#13;
develop the treasury, public credit, and procurement functions. The Government has requested&#13;
IDA to finance reforms in the area of budget formulation and internal audit and control.&#13;
Implementation of the SIGFA project would involve the full integration of all donor technical&#13;
assistance into a single team, with all consultants, regardless of financing source working under&#13;
the direction of an internationally experienced Technical Director, who would report to CERAP.&#13;
The Government would seek USAID, IDB, and IDA advice in the selection of the Technical&#13;
Director, who will be financed by USAID.&#13;
22.   Proposed IDA Assistance ($3.0 million in Technical Assistance and $.20 million for&#13;
Training): IDA would finance a competitively awarded, two-year renewable contract with a firm&#13;
with relevant international and specialized experience in public sector budgeting and internal&#13;
auditing. Long term residential advisory assistance, supported by short term consultants, would&#13;
assist the Ministry of Finance, the Commission for Government Financial Administration and&#13;
Control and spending agencies strengthen the budget formulation, programming, and evaluation&#13;
processes as well as reorient and strengthen the operation of internal audit units. Budget&#13;
formulation would center on macro-budgeting in advance of the detailed budget process;&#13;
improvements in the budget classification system and budget coverage, improvements in capital&#13;
and recurrent cost budgeting, and the design and introduction of an intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
transfer mechanism in support of local government. Programming would focus on the&#13;
development of processes linking budget implementation and cash management. Evaluation&#13;
would involve systems, linked to the service delivery surveys as possible, to evaluate budget&#13;
execution and results. The internal audit consultant would develop policies and procedures, well&#13;
coordinated with the external audit sub-system, for internal control mechanisms and internal audit&#13;
units in each institution reporting to the responsible minister. These units would not exercise&#13;
blanket ex ante control, but provide continuous ex-post audit review of transactions, systems,&#13;
policies, and procedures to ensure compliance as well as to evaluate and recommend&#13;
strengthening of internal controls, especially during the transition period to the new decentralized&#13;
financial management system. The level of effort of this proposed technical assistance is expected&#13;
to be about 96 person months of long term residential assistance and 32 months of short term&#13;
technical assistance. The consultant services contractor would be responsible for developing and&#13;
conducting appropriate short courses in the relevant budget and internal audit subsystem areas.&#13;
IDA would finance the participant and administrative expenses of these programs (estimated cost:&#13;
$0.20 million) which would be replicated and expanded by INAP.&#13;
23.   Expected Outputs: For the SIGFA generally, the following outputs are expected: (i) a&#13;
new, unified public sector financial management system and implementing regulations operative in&#13;
all spending agencies; (ii) a standardized and automated government-wide accounting system&#13;
operating in all spending agencies able to annually produce consolidated financial statements of&#13;
the central government, (iii) improved ex post audit capacity installed and operative in the Office&#13;
of the Comptroller General; (iv) improved cash management and treasury functions; and (v)&#13;
improved debt management operations and their integration into the Government's financial&#13;
management system. The IDA financed budget component would produce: (vi) a budget&#13;
document and process that covers all major revenue and expenditure sources; (vii) improved&#13;
budget classification in full accordance with accounting classifications; (viii) improved expenditure&#13;
forecasting and monitoring; (ix) the installation and application of a budgeting system which&#13;
emphasizes results and outcomes and associated performance indicators in all IRA institutions; (x)&#13;
improved capital and recurrent cost budgeting; (xi) the introduction of fiscal transfer budgeting;&#13;
and (xii) the issuance and periodic update of a Budget Manual that reflects the interrelationships&#13;
with accounting, treasury and debt management. Outputs expected from the internal audit&#13;
component would center on (xiii) the creation or strengthening of internal audit units in&#13;
participating IRA institutions and consequent measurable improvement in budget execution and&#13;
financial accountability.&#13;
Information Technology ($6.91 million, including training, 21% of total base costs):&#13;
24.   The Problem: A modern, well designed, and integrated information technology system is&#13;
critical to the institutional restructurings and improvements in human resource and financial&#13;
management systems contemplated under the public sector modernization program. Nicaragua's&#13;
progress in information technology development atrophied in the 1980s due to the absence of&#13;
suppliers, spare parts, and poor maintenance of the existing limited installed capacity. Although&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
the situation is improving, serious problems remain, as identified in studies6 completed during&#13;
project preparation:&#13;
* Only nine of 31 central government institutions have information centers and systems, and&#13;
these centers account for 83 percent of the government work force with computer training;&#13;
* There is a paucity of trained personnel in information systems technology. Although several&#13;
university programs are training technicians and professionals in the field, the Government's&#13;
non-competitive wage structure hampers its ability to attract and retain qualified information&#13;
systems specialists;&#13;
* Although the Government has received over 1,400 computers from donors in recent years,&#13;
their utility has been constrained because information systems are generally poorly developed,&#13;
with few connections between databases and the near total absence of networking;&#13;
* Hardware and software systems are diverse and often incompatible;&#13;
* In public sector financial management the absence of a universal information system&#13;
framework and architecture has led to the development of several specialized, stand-alone&#13;
systems which have had the perverse result of further fragmenting and weakening central&#13;
budgeting, expenditure control, and accounting systems,&#13;
* In the absence of a government-wide information technology plan and associated standards&#13;
and management arrangements, especially in the areas of public finance and human resources&#13;
management, program imbalances have emerged. For example, in the Ministry of Finance&#13;
technology support for revenue systems improvement is relatively well endowed while those&#13;
entities charged with expenditure control have been, with certain exceptions, ignored;&#13;
- Information equipment in several ministries experience periodic and prolonged breakdowns&#13;
due to inadequate maintenance budgets and service contracts; and&#13;
* A positive, although unintended, side-effect of Nicaragua's decade long hiatus in information&#13;
systems development is that the Government does not have a large investment in older&#13;
mainframe equipment and proprietary systems, and, therefore, is well positioned to adopt on a&#13;
systematic and comprehensive basis the new "open" technology and put in place modern&#13;
information systems without the need to develop extensive "bridging" programs with older,&#13;
closed systems.&#13;
25.   The Government's Program: Recognizing the need for carefully designed and sequenced&#13;
information technology investments to support its financial management and civil service reforms,&#13;
the Government has proposed a five-year program for differentiated investments at the center and&#13;
ministerial levels. The information systems design is consistent with the information systems&#13;
management model recommended by the IMF.7 The SIGFA central system at the Finance&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Ministry would require a super mini computer with capacity to handle 64 work stations to support&#13;
the accounting, budget, treasury, public credit and procurement sub-systems. The Controller&#13;
General's Office, and the three large spending agencies would require medium size computers and&#13;
the fifteen smaller agencies would require a smaller computer configuration. The cost of the&#13;
hardware, software and communications linkages is summarized in Table 5. The investment&#13;
would take account of existing information technology in the public sector, and is considered the&#13;
minimum necessary to appropriately support the policy and procedural reforms contemplated in&#13;
the institutional restructuring, financial management, and civil service components.&#13;

26    The systems would be brought on-line in a staged manner starting the project's second&#13;
year to ensure implementation of the various sub-system reforms being financed by USAID, IDA,&#13;
and IDB. The terms and conditions governing each ministry's participation in information&#13;
technology investments would form an important part of the IRA. An indicative systems&#13;
installation plan is presented at Table 6. The Government has also prepared a comprehensive&#13;
training program under which 1,400 Ministry of Finance and spending agency personnel would be&#13;
trained over the five-year period through 24 specialized programs. Targeted personnel would be&#13;
drawn from three occupational categories; managers, end-users, and technical systems personnel.&#13;

27.   Proposed IDA Assistance ($3.0 million in Technical Assistance. $2.56 million&#13;
computers/software. $.50 million training): IDA would finance a competitively awarded, two-&#13;
year renewable contract with a firm with relevant international experience. The selected firm,&#13;
specialized in information systems development, would be responsible for assisting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Government design and implement its information technology development program specifically&#13;
related to financial management and human resources systems development. IDA would also&#13;
finance the procurement of the required hardware and software. The Information Systems&#13;
Contractor would assist CERAP and the National Directorate for Information Systems in the&#13;
procurement process. Finally, IDA would finance the cost of the information technology training&#13;
program (estimated cost $0.50 million), which would be required to ensure the continued&#13;
development and sustained operation of the new financial management and human resources&#13;
information system. The contractor would provide the training, either directly or through sub-&#13;
contracting, in conjunction with INAP and the UNDP, which would be responsible for the&#13;
administering the participant training funds and logistical requirements.&#13;
28.   Expected Outputs: Major output indicators would be the installation and proper operation&#13;
of financial management and human resources information systems in up to 20 ministries and&#13;
decentralized agencies and the number of associated staff who have received training in various&#13;
aspects of information systems management and technology. Another important output indicator&#13;
would be the level and execution of information technology maintenance budgets.&#13;
Reform Management ($4.24 million, including training, 13% of total base cost):&#13;
29    The Government has sought to design a flexible management structure (see Figure 1) that&#13;
promotes debate and inclusion of key players while permitting timely decision making and&#13;
implementation of a complex reform process. CERAP has been empowered through Presidential&#13;
Decree 44-94 to articulate Government policy and strategy, approve draft laws for submission to&#13;
the President and legislature, and oversee program implementation and the institutional&#13;
restructuring process. CERAP is chaired by the Minister of the Presidency and is comprised of&#13;
the Ministers of Finance, Construction and Transport, Economic Development, Social Action,&#13;
Government, the two Vice Ministers of the Presidency and the Vice Minister of Finance, who&#13;
would also serve as the CERAP Executive Secretary. Presidential Decree 44-94 establishes&#13;
several commissions which would have responsibility for overseeing the development and&#13;
implementation of the various reform initiatives under the auspices of CERAP. Especially&#13;
important commissions for the project would include: Administrative Reform (i.e., institutional&#13;
restructuring), Civil Service; Government Financial Administration and Control; and&#13;
Decentralization. The analytical work of these commissions would be supported by relevant line&#13;
ministry personnel and national and international consultants as appropriate. CERAP members&#13;
would chair the respective commissions overseeing the specific reform components. The&#13;
CERAP Chairman can invite other ministers in an ex-officio capacity with the right to vote when&#13;
the subject matter would affect their sector. As a condition for credit effectiveness, CERAP&#13;
would prepare and issue the internal operating procedures for both CERAP and its subordinate&#13;
commissions. CERAP will establish an Advisory Committee to involve non-governmental interest&#13;
groups as authorized in Decree 44-94. It has already established a Donor Advisory Group on&#13;
Public Sector Modernization, which is expected to meet in-country on at least a quarterly basis.&#13;
30.   The Vice Minister of Finance has been named the CERAP Executive Secretary. The&#13;
Executive Secretary the Vice Minister would manage, on a continuous basis, the public sector&#13;
modernization program and IDA project. The Vice Minister would be supported by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Coordinating Unit for the Reform of the Public Sector (UCRESEP). Through a PHRD Grant and&#13;
UNDP financing, this unit's operational structure has been defined and terms of reference drafted&#13;
for all key management and staff positions (see Figure 2). UCRESEP would be staffed initially&#13;
with Nicaraguan consultants with line responsibility for key program components, i.e. Institutional&#13;
Restructuring, Civil Service Reform, Integrated Financial Management, Information Technology,&#13;
Decentralization, Training, and Service Delivery Surveys. These staff would serve, as&#13;
appropriate, as counterparts to each of the principal institutional contractors as well as oversee&#13;
reform implementation. The Institutional Restructuring contractor, in addition to its responsibility&#13;
for providing technical assistance in its component area, would assist the Executive Secretary and&#13;
UCRESEP Director in overall coordination of components within the restructuring institutions.&#13;
These institutions would be required to designate a senior staff member to serve as the agency's&#13;
Counterpart Officer to work with the Executive Secretary, UCRESEP Director, staff and&#13;
consultants. Finally, UCRESEP would contract the services of a Chief Accountant, a&#13;
Procurement Officer and a lawyer. A long term resident advisor would assist the Executive&#13;
Secretary prepare the final reform design, launch, and assist in early program implementation.&#13;
During appraisal agreement was reached with the authorities on this staff complement and the&#13;
Government agreed to have the CERAP/UCRESEP staff in place before credit effectiveness.&#13;
31.   The Service Delivery Survey (SDS) would also be financed under the project management&#13;
component. The surveys would be an innovative and essential management tool both in&#13;
establishing initial IRA performance objectives and annually assessing improvements in service&#13;
delivery. EDI assisted the Government design the SDS instrument during project preparation and&#13;
would help conduct, during the first quarter of 1995, the baseline surveys for the first five&#13;
agencies initiating restructuring. Planning for the initial five surveys was initiated concurrent with&#13;
the IDA appraisal mission. UCRESEP would retain one or more local or regional contractors to&#13;
conduct the annual surveys and a professional with specific responsibility for managing the initial&#13;
institutional base-line and subsequent annual performance surveys.&#13;
32.   Proposed IDA Assistance ($2.6 million): IDA would support the CERAP Executive&#13;
Secretariat, the respective CERAP technical commissions and UCRESEP as presented in Table 7.&#13;
It would finance UCRESEP staff cost, the analytical work of the various commissions created&#13;
under Presidential Decree 44-94, the SDS, annual project audits, long term resident consultants,&#13;
and purchase of selected equipment.&#13;

Project Cost and Financing&#13;
33.   Total project costs, as shown on Table 8, have been estimated at $33.5 million over the&#13;
five-year project life. IDA financing of $23.0 million equivalent would cover approximately 69&#13;
percent of project costs while other donor contributions and the Government of Nicaragua would&#13;
finance 24 percent and 7 percent respectively.&#13;

SECTION B. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization and Implementation&#13;
35.   As described in para. 30 above, the CERAP Executive Secretary would serve as the&#13;
operationally responsible manager for the public sector reform program. The Executive Secretary&#13;
would be supported by the UCRESEP. This unit would have substantive staff to oversee various&#13;
reform components and supervise institutional contractors and long term advisors, as well as staff&#13;
to assist in the day to day administrative management of the project and other donor&#13;
contributions. INAP, with the support of the UNDP, would manage training activities other than&#13;
the core training programs initially administered by the respective institutional contractors (see&#13;
Schedule 2).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
36.   Contracts for goods (computer equipment and software) shall be packaged into lots&#13;
valued at $100,000 equivalent or more and would be procured through Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB) for an estimated aggregate amount of $2.6 million. LIB procedures are justified&#13;
given the small number of providers with after-delivery service in Nicaragua. Contracts for other&#13;
goods and equipment with estimated values of less than $100,000 equivalent would be procured&#13;
using international shopping procedures; and contracts below $25,000 equivalent for other goods&#13;
and equipment would be procured through local shopping. Local and international shopping&#13;
procedures combined would be applied to contracts up to an aggregate amount of $500,000&#13;
equivalent. Standard IDA bidding documents would be used for LIB. All procurement for&#13;
training under the various components would be in accordance with IDA guidelines. [NAP would&#13;
administer training activities with the assistance of UNDP (see Technical Annex, Schedule 2,&#13;
para. 4). Consultant services would be procured in accordance with IDA Consultants guidelines&#13;
dated August, 1981. For the four large institutional consulting contracts, IDA's standard form of&#13;
contract would be used for consulting services . Terms of reference for all consultant contracts&#13;
would be satisfactory to IDA. All LIB procurement of goods, all individual consulting contracts&#13;
above $50,000 equivalent, and all contracts with consulting firms above $100,000 equivalent,&#13;
including the four major institutional contracts, would be subject to prior review by IDA. The&#13;
exemption from prior review for consulting contracts below the $50,000 and $100,000 thresholds&#13;
would only apply to contracts up to an aggregate value of $1.0 million equivalent. Finally, to&#13;
ensure consistency in the administration of individual contracts valued below $50,000 equivalent&#13;
the first three individual consultant contracts in each calendar year would be subject to prior&#13;
review by IDA. These review arrangements would provide for IDA review of approximately 80&#13;
percent of the value of all contracts financed by IDA.&#13;
Disbursements and Financing&#13;
37.   The project is expected to be implemented over a five year period. Disbursements would&#13;
be administered by UCRESEP. All withdrawal applications would be fully documented, except&#13;
for expenditures under contracts for goods valued below US$100,000 equivalent, individual&#13;
consultant contracts valued at or below $50,000 equivalent after the first three approved each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
year and consultant firm contracts valued at or below $100,000 equivalent up to $1.0 million&#13;
which would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), for which detailed&#13;
documentation evidencing expenditures would be retained by UCRESEP and made available for&#13;
review by auditors and by IDA staff UNDP would provide "bridge" financing, as needed, to&#13;
cover project activities initiated prior to loan effectiveness. Retroactive financing in an amount of&#13;
SDR 1,360,000 (US$2 million equivalent), approximately 9 percent of the credit, would be&#13;
available for eligible expenditures incurred after January 30, 1995. This financing would cover the&#13;
cost of additional diagnostic work and project start-up activities. A Special Account in US&#13;
dollars would be opened in the Central Bank, with an authorized allocation of $1.5 million&#13;
equivalent. Annual audit reports would be produced, starting in December, 1995, at the end of&#13;
each calendar year and submitted to IDA within six months after year end. The expected project&#13;
completion date is June 30, 2000 and the credit closing date would be December 31, 2000. An&#13;
implementation completion report would be prepared by the Government and submitted to IDA&#13;
no later than June, 30, 2001.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
38.   IDA would supervise the implementation of the credit through frequent supervision&#13;
missions with a total annual supervision input of approximately 20 staff weeks. Assurances were&#13;
obtained that: (a) the Government would provide IDA with semi-annual progress reports; (b)&#13;
annual reviews of project implementation would be conducted jointly by the Government and IDA&#13;
no later than March 30 of each year, starting in 1996. The annual reviews would include, inter&#13;
alia: (i) project performance against the matrix of key project activities and implementation&#13;
targets, (ii) progress of each participating institution under the terms of its respective IRA; (iii)&#13;
management performance of UCRESEP, (iv) INAP's training program management; and (v)&#13;
policy and coordination activities of CERAP; (c) a comprehensive mid-term review would take&#13;
place no later than June 30, 1997, replacing the annual review, in which the following, inter alia,&#13;
would be discussed additionally: (i) the new Administration's assessment and continued&#13;
commitment to the reform program; (ii) overall progress of the reform program, particularly the&#13;
integration of separate component activities into a cohesive and complementary set of actions; (iii)&#13;
institutional capacity to carry on (or, alternatively, slow down or speed up) project activities; and&#13;
(iv) project redesign or corrective actions, as needed; and (d) to substantially achieve&#13;
implementation targets as in Schedule 1 (a) and (b). Terms of reference satisfactory to IDA&#13;
would be prepared by the Government for the mid-term review.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
NICARAGUA&#13;
DRAFT INSTITUTIONAL RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT'&#13;
BETWEEN THE&#13;
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM&#13;
AND THE&#13;
MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
Whereas, the Government of Nicaragua wishes to become an Administration with the&#13;
capacity to be decisive, modern, small, strong, facultative, efficient and technologically&#13;
able to produce services of quality through improved allocation and utilization of&#13;
resources suitable for the development of an appropriate economic and social framework&#13;
for the financing of democracy in the country,&#13;
Whereas, in order to improve the level of services that the Public Sector extends to the&#13;
population it is necessary to deepen the process of institutional restructuring, which has&#13;
already been initiated in the ministries and autonomous institutions, including improving&#13;
financial administration, human resources, and technical systems,&#13;
Whereas, in the Public Sector there exists a dispersion of responsibilities and obsolete&#13;
technology which do not contribute to an efficient administration and which can&#13;
compromise economic stability and create obstacles for productive growth,&#13;
Whereas, the Presidency of the Republic created on the 28 of October 1994, by means of&#13;
Decree No. 44-94, the Executive Committee for Public Administration Reform (CERAP)&#13;
to lead the strategy in the process of reform. The same Decree created both the Executive&#13;
Secretary to oversee the execution, supervise, and monitor the plans and programs&#13;
approved by the Committee, and the Coordinating Unit for the Reform and Modernization&#13;
of the Public Sector (UCRESEP),&#13;
In addition, the reform created seven Sectorial Reform Commissions, whose functions are&#13;
to assure implementation of sector reforms, design plans and programs and submit viable&#13;
sectorial alternatives to CERAP,&#13;
Whereas, the functions of UCRESEP are to monitor the execution of the reform projects,&#13;
offer technical and operational support to the Executive Secretary, and administer the&#13;
financial resources of the World Bank and other organizations,&#13;
I Informal translation of working draft IRA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Whereas, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) has&#13;
initiated a process of institutional and legal restructuring,&#13;
Whereas, MARENA would like to effect substantial changes in its accounting, budgeting,&#13;
human resources and information systems, to strengthen its administration and cost&#13;
controls, and augment the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of its service delivery,&#13;
THEREFORE:&#13;
Mr. Antonio Lacayo Oyaguran, Minister of the Presidency, as Coordinator of CERAP,&#13;
married, residing in Managua, Industrial Engineer; and Mrs. Mirna Somarriba Garcia, Vice&#13;

Clause 8: Time Period of IRA. The period of this IRA is twenty four months beginning&#13;
on the date of signature, with the option to extend it for an additional year, with the&#13;
written agreement of the parties.&#13;
Clause 9: Coordination, Monitoring, and Control. For the effect of coordination, and&#13;
monitoring of the activities herein, CERAP has designated the Coordinating Unit for the&#13;
Reform and Modernization of the Public Sector (UCRESEP). MARENA should assign a&#13;
representative of the highest level of the Ministry as a representative to UCRESEP and a&#13;
member of the staff, dedicated full time to the implementation of the Institutional&#13;

and one magnetic copy. Additionally, CERAP will be able to solicit at any moment it feels&#13;
necessary, either directly or by way of the Executive Secretary, verbal or written reports,&#13;
partial or complete, on the implementation of the activities that are contemplated in this&#13;
IRA.&#13;
Clause 11: Evaluation. CERAP will conduct two external evaluations at the end of each&#13;
year, for the duration of this IRA. These evaluations will serve as the basis for&#13;
modification, expansion and termination of the Agreement during the next year.&#13;
Furthermore, CERAP will be able to accommodate additional evaluations when it&#13;
considers pertinent&#13;
Clause 12: Modifications to the Agreements. This Agreement will be neither totally nor&#13;
partially modified in its parts without the written consent of the official representatives of&#13;
CERAP and MARENA.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The parties therefore decide to sign the present Institutional Restructuring Agreement,&#13;

Schedule 2&#13;
Training Plan and Budget&#13;
Nicaragua Institutional Development Credit&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    Training would constitute an important part of the Government's Public Sector&#13;
Modernization Program. Training of public sector managers, technicians and&#13;
administrative personnel would serve both as an important vehicle for modernizing public&#13;
sector institutions and as a key incentive for public servants to improve their own skills&#13;
and collectively the performance of their respective institutions. Accordingly, the&#13;
proposed Institutional Development project would support a significant, but focused,&#13;
training effort.&#13;
The Training Concept&#13;
2.    Training proposed under the project would be tightly focused on developing and&#13;
reinforcing the critical skills required of civil servants to effectively support and carry out&#13;
the public sector modernization program envisaged under the project. Accordingly,&#13;
training has been structured around three core modules: management and personnel&#13;
administration, financial management, and information system technology. Each of these&#13;
modules was respectively prepared by the consultants who were retained by IDA to&#13;
develop the Civil Service Reform, Financial Management, and Information Technology&#13;
components of the project. Development of course material and initial delivery of training&#13;
would constitute an important task of each of the long term residential advisory teams&#13;
proposed to be retained under the project.&#13;
3.    Training opportunities would constitute one of the more important incentives&#13;
offered by CERAP to each institution entering the modernization program and, as such,&#13;
would form an important part of each negotiated Institutional Restructuring Agreement&#13;
(IRA). The scope and pace of the training program would, therefore, be integrally tied to&#13;
the underlying institutional restructuring program and process which envisions&#13;
approximately five ministries/institutions joining the program annually. A significant cross&#13;
section of senior and mid-level management as well as technical and administrative staff&#13;
from each participating IRA institution would be provided the opoortunity of participating&#13;
in a range of on-the-job training (OJT) or short courses over the two or three years the&#13;
IRA remains in force for each participating institution. As noted, each of the proposed&#13;
training modules, with the exception of the management training module, has been&#13;
designed to provide the operational skills necessary to implement the new systems (i.e.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
personnel administration, financial management, and information system technology) that&#13;
would be installed in each participating IRA institution during the course of program&#13;
execution. The attached tables present the different training modules that would be&#13;
further developed, tested, and implemented under the project. Over the five year life-of-&#13;
project approximately 8,000 participant training rounds involving 20 participating IRA&#13;
institutions would have been conducted.&#13;
Training Program Management and Implementation&#13;
4.    While the development of course content and initial delivery would be the&#13;
responsibility of each of the four institutional contractors, the overall administration and&#13;
associated financial management of the training program would be the responsibility of the&#13;
Nicaraguan Institute for Public Administration (INAP). During project preparation, the&#13;
Government indicated its desire for INAP to assume the lead role in coordinating and&#13;
managing public sector human resources development with UNDP providing technical&#13;
assistance to INAP and channeling donor funds. This arrangement represents a logical&#13;
division of responsibilities between IDA and the UNDP and is the central mandate of&#13;
[NAP. The UNDP has supported the institutional development of INAP for the past&#13;
several years and will continue its capacity building support. This proposed arrangement&#13;
would provide assurance that the large and complex task associated with the logistical&#13;
arrangements, administration and financing of hundreds of participants annually would be&#13;
adequately addressed under the program. Accordingly, prior to negotiations, IDA, the&#13;
UNDP and INAP would develop an inter-institutional agreement which would spell out&#13;
this cooperative arrangement consistent with IDA/UNDP policy and guidelines.' During&#13;
appraisal, these arrangements were confirmed and further developed with the UNDP,&#13;
[NAP, and UCRESEP. An Aide Memoire, dated 01.25.95, was developed and signed by&#13;
the respective institutions and is available in the project file.&#13;
5.    It is expected that after the courses have been developed and pilot tested by the&#13;
respective residential advisory teams, INAP would competitively contract out to local and&#13;
regional providers (e.g. universities, consultant firms, regional institutions and NGOs) the&#13;
various training modules to ensure broad program coverage and to develop permanent&#13;
training capacity both in Nicaragua and the Central American region.&#13;
Estimate Training Program Cost&#13;
6.    Over the five year project life approximately 8,000 participant training rounds&#13;
would have been conducted involving more than 20 different courses to be developed and&#13;
executed under the program. The cost of the training activity, which would be financed by&#13;
IDA, is estimated at $2.0 million, representing an average participant per course cost of&#13;
$250. The sustainability of this important capacity building initiative will depend heavily&#13;
on the Government's ability to find and alternative source of financing once the IDA&#13;
"Standard Annex to be Used in all UNDP Project Documents Which are Nationally Executed and are&#13;
Partially or Totally Funded by Government Cost-Sharing Resources Originating in World Bank&#13;
Loans, or Technical Cooperation Grants Administered by the World Bank"; 11/21/1994.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
resources have been disbursed. One such source is the 2% government payroll tax&#13;
presently channeled entirely to the Nicaraguan Technical Training Institute (INATEC) for&#13;
vocational training. During project negotiations, IDA will seek agreement with the&#13;
Government to apply a portion of these or other sources to maintain the curriculum&#13;
developed under the proposed project.&#13;

ATDE MEMOIRE&#13;
Representatives of INAP, CERAP/UCRESEP, UNDP, and IDA represented respectively by Mr.&#13;
Alfrcdo Solorzano, Mr. Luis ViWalta, Mr. James Rawley al Mr. Ronald Myers met on 26-27 January, 1995&#13;
to develop an understanding of: the Government's public sector management training objectives and p1ms;&#13;
the respective plas of ULNDP and IDA for supporting the Government in the attainment of its truining&#13;
objectives; and proposed cooperative working relationships for implamcnting traIning assistance suppont to&#13;
rNAP on the part of IJNDP aud IDA. The following paagraphs record the&#13;
understandings reached on each of these themes during the mecEings:&#13;
1. The Government's Public Sector Managcment Training Objectivesand Plan:&#13;
** The Government is committed to the reinvigoration of the public sector through a progm of&#13;
public sector reform and human resource development To this cnd, the Govertlment has recently initiated a&#13;
comprehensive public sector management TeforTn program through the issuancc of Presidential Decree 44-94;&#13;
11 The Government has assigncd INAP tie principal responsibility for developing the&#13;
manasement and technical skills ofthe Niaraguan civil service;&#13;
f lNAP intends to fulill ls objective over thc medium term (i.e. 10 ye.r) through:&#13;
- The development of a trminal degree program in public administration leading to a&#13;
Maser's Deore in Public Adminlstion to be confcrred by INAP and the National&#13;
Univerity;&#13;
- The execution of in service short courses in a number of relevant subject areas for a&#13;
large cross section of the Nicarguan civil service.&#13;
To ensure a consistent and adequate flow of resources to cover a significant portion of the recurrent&#13;
costs associated with thesc programs rbe Government intends to asip to INAP a portion of the tax revenues&#13;
currently assigned to INATEC.&#13;
2. UNDP Support for Public Sector Management Training: The UNDP has bcen requested by the&#13;
Govcrmnent to continuc its support and serve as the lead donor institution for training in support of the&#13;
Government's Public Sector Modernizatlon Progm. The MNDP has accepLed this responsibility and&#13;
developed a multi-donor proposal which will shortly be sent to UNDP Headquartrs for approval. The&#13;
project would provide support for the Instinttional strengthening of INAP, assist TNAP in the development&#13;
of an Applied Master's Program in Public Adminisaion and provide for UNDP oversight of the S2.0&#13;
million in-service training program to be financed through the LDA Institutional Development Credit. The&#13;
UJNDP would commit S500,000 of its own resources and assist the Government in the mobilization from&#13;
other donors of an additional S4A milon. Total project cost would be S6.9 million including the proposed&#13;
IDA contribution of 2.o million. Thc UNDP confirmed its willingness to administcr training funds to be&#13;
made available under tie proposed IDA  stitutional Development Credit (see below).&#13;
3. MDA Institutional Development Credit: Under the proposed InstirUtional Development Credit (IDC)&#13;
IDA would make availabic up to S2.0 Eillion to support the Government's in-service training requirements&#13;
as.ociated with Ihe implementation of the Public Sector Modcrnization Nlrogram. The in- service traiing&#13;
progrdm would bc under ibe joint leadership and management oversight of CERAP/UCRESEP, INAP and&#13;
UN'DP and would centcr on the development and repeatcd imnplementation of a series of training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ihe proposed in-service training programs would be concentrted in the following areas: public sector&#13;
management; financial management; personnel adminilstaion and management and information technology.&#13;
The proposed in-servicc taining programs would be developed jointly by the technical assislancc contactors&#13;
assigned to the respective comrponents of the reform program financed by the DC and INAP. In service&#13;
taining would be dirceted to the civil servants in those instirtions with active Insfitutional Restructuring&#13;
Agreements (AREs). As trainin.- modulcs are developed the respective technical assistance conaactors and&#13;
£NAP would pilot test and refne ehe modules prior to the routine aad repeated implementation of the&#13;
modules. Aftcr this initial pilot phase, INAP, in close coordination with CERAPIUCRESEP, w4. aid assumc&#13;
fillI responsibility for the implementation of subsequenL traunig cycles The technLical assistance contractor&#13;
would continue to be available, as appropiate, to provide raining and ensure conformny of the training&#13;
pro;rams with the ongoing and evolving work in participating IRA institutions. Given INAP's iotention to&#13;
remain a small institutlon with no more than 23 profcssional staff and in line with the broader Government&#13;
policy which emphasizes the private provision of public services, whenever possible, INAP would contract&#13;
with individuals or firms to carry out The expanded and cyclical repetition of the respective taining modules.&#13;
The TDA Task Manager recommended that the scope and level of effort of each traming module be carefully&#13;
analyized by INAP and whcu training modules involved a signUiicant number of participants and/or multiple&#13;
course replications consideration be given to contractig firms instiead of individuals to lesson the&#13;
management burden on INAP staff. To encourage the development of in-country trining capacity preferencc&#13;
would also be accorded to the selection of Nicaraguan finms and individuals or joint ventures involving&#13;
Nicaraguan firss or lnsbtutions. UCRESEP/ANAP and IDA would undertake an evaluation of the in-service&#13;
training program after the second year and make adjustments as necessary.&#13;
4. Understandings Reached: The rollowlng understandings were agreed to among the parties.&#13;
INAP and UCRESEP: NP will undertake a technical skills assessment and needs analysis of the&#13;
initial four instlittions prcsently developing nsitutional Restructuring Agrcements (ARIs). INAP wil work&#13;

40 Support INAP in the preparation, as appropriae of relevant documentation requreod by TDA&#13;
for the issuance of Letters of No-Objection and disbursement of funds.&#13;
To cany oat these responsibilities, as well as die broader responsibilies of its own support to INAP,&#13;
the UNDP will provide professional admlnlsutive and flnancial staff support as appropriate.&#13;
IDA: Upon recommendation of the Govemmentr IDA wlll assign betwe three and five percent&#13;
of the funds acually committed to JNAP for n-service taining under the IDC to help defray the UNDP&#13;
overhead cost associated with the technical and adminisUanve support described in pargaph 4.&#13;
CERAP/UCRESEP and the IJNDP will cstablished the specific cost sharing formula and advise the IDA no&#13;
later than 15 February, 1995.&#13;
Conclusion: All pares agreed to updacj/modiry their respective project documentaion to reflect these&#13;
understandings as well as complete their rcspeciive internal approval processes as rpidly as possible.&#13;

            Nicaragua - Institutional Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The goal of the reform in Nicaragua is a
            public sector which is "small, strong, efficient...and
            [which] acts as a facilitator to the private sector."
            Successful implementation of a comprehensive, coherent, and
            well-targeted public sector modernization program would
            represent an important advance in Nicaragua's ongoing
            structural adjustment effort. The Institutional Development
            Project will be a major source of support for the reform
            effort. Its objectives will be improvement in service
            delivery by those institutions restructured under the
            program and increases in public savings attributable to the
            program. The project will be composed of the following
            components: 1) institutional restructuring; 2) civil service
            reform; 3) integrated financial management; 4) information
            technology; and 5) reform management.
