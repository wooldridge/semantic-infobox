FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.    In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.    The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies   into  dollars   (or  into  any   other  numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step  for  international   comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.     To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.    It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
This research project has produced eleven reports, which are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored  by   the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
7-  country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World  Bank  Staff Working   Paper series.    The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
-             The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes         that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical  and other   information known to country experts.       It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs."   In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania,   a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;

National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.    These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.        It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.    The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.       The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper reviews the official estimates of Romania's net material&#13;
product (NMP) and gross domestic product (GDP) and the underlying methods. It&#13;
also reviews the data on growth rates of NMP and GDP. The paper identified&#13;
possible sources for biases in the estimates of levels of NMP or GDP in the&#13;
agricultural, services and foreign trade sectors and also of the growth rates&#13;
of overall NMP and GDP. It then considers a few alternative exchange rates to&#13;
convert the national currency GDP into US dollars and shows resulting per&#13;
capita GDP numbers in US dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
The officially published and externally available record of Romanian&#13;
national accounts statistics remains limited in spite of Romania's membership&#13;
of the World Bank and the IMF since 1972.   The only regular publication of the&#13;
Romanian Central Statistical Office (CSO), Anuarul Statistic al R. S. Romania,&#13;
through the issue dated 1982, does not have a special section on national&#13;
income and product accounts. Its tables provide only limited data and&#13;
explanation of "net material product" (NMP). It is an insufficient source for&#13;
(1) deriving point estimates of GDP in national currency units (NCUs), (2)&#13;
converting values in NCUs to US dollars, or (3) evaluating growth rates.&#13;
Moreover, almost no useful supplementary material on these questions can be&#13;
found in secondary sources.&#13;
A better basis for research was the few lines on the Romanian&#13;
national accounts in the International Financial Statistics and two annual&#13;
editions of the Romanian Economic Memorandum (described as a "confidential"&#13;
document). Substantial help was given by the Romanian CSO in 1982 when in&#13;
response to a request of the author it provided estimates of GDP in current&#13;
and constant prices from 1975 to 1980, together with some additional details&#13;
of the national accounts. National product series going back to 1970 and&#13;
information needed to evaluate the factor-cost content of the official&#13;
estimates were not, however, provided. The Romanian CSO did not participate&#13;
in a conference on the research project at the World Bank in the fall of 1982,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and did not provide written or verbal comments on a preliminary draft of this&#13;
paper. Romania also withdrew from Phase Four of the International Comparisons&#13;
Project (ICP). There has therefore been limited opportunity to date to&#13;
resolve the outstanding methodological questions through collaboration with&#13;
the Government.&#13;
If very good data were available on the country, appropriate&#13;
concentration could have been on questions of domestic prices and exchange&#13;
rates. Instead, for Romania there are numerous data of uncertain&#13;
- description. Their explication makes a long paper, beginning with a review of&#13;
the kinds and activity-content of the several accounts on net material&#13;
product. This review is necessary because the Romanian CSO has built up its&#13;
GDP estimates from the NMP accounts, both absolute values and growth rates.&#13;
Hence, GDP can at best be no better than NMP estimates.&#13;
The estimated value of Romanian NMP at any point in time may be&#13;
distorted from any of the following sources: (1) an overestimate of the&#13;
amounts of agricultural output simultaneously attributed to production by&#13;
agricultural households and consumption by the same units; (2) the&#13;
calculation of physical outputs from agriculture in non-standard units (for&#13;
example, grain in units of variable moisture content) in the centralized&#13;
calculation of value-added by the CSO; (3) the attribution of some losses in&#13;
harvest, transportation and storage of agricultural products to consumption by&#13;
humans; and (4) possible overestimate of the amount and relative quality of&#13;
so-called "new" industrial products consumed by households and included in&#13;
producer fixed capital investments. It may be noted that problems similar to&#13;
items (2) and (3) above in the case of the extractive industry (e.g., dirt in&#13;
lignite coal) are mostly netted out in the calculation of value-added. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
additional problem is noted below in the calculation of value-added in foreign&#13;
pnciuet&#13;
trade, but because the Romanian ay-tem is common to most national sAstemp&#13;
based on NMP it is not considered a distortion of NMP, but of GDPI.   It is&#13;
difficult to objectively evaluate the quantitative margin of error without&#13;
help from the Romanian authorities.   A five percent possible error mentioned&#13;
in the text is merely a guess; it could be higher and depends on the point in ; e&#13;
time and the system of exchange rates used to convert NCUs to US dollars.&#13;
Romanian prices raise more than the usual concern with price&#13;
distortions in a centrally planned economy.   The country's relative prices,&#13;
especially those in industry compared to agriculture, are far out of line with&#13;
price relatives in other CPEs at roughly similar levels of development.    In&#13;
addition, Romania's official rates of industrial growth, as reported among the&#13;
highest in the world, may be based on a significant understatement of price&#13;
inflation in the industrial sector. Roughly half of industrial output has its&#13;
nomenclature renewed every five years, giving significant chance to overstate&#13;
the value of "new" products. These issues are reviewed along with the&#13;
available data on prices and information on the Romanian price system in a&#13;
section of the paper now placed in the Annex.&#13;
Estimates of GDP in NCUs can be built up from NMP using either of&#13;
three accounts: (1) value-added by sector of origin, (2) value-added as factor&#13;
income, or (3) final expenditures. The study generally concentrated on&#13;
sector-of-origin accounts, although for international comparisons final&#13;
expenditures are also of interest. This paper is especially concerned with&#13;
value-added in Romanian sevices and foreign trade. Value-added in services in&#13;
the GDP estimates by the Romanian CSO cannot be easily reconciled with data&#13;
published in the Romanian statistical yearbook. Services may be over-valued&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
because of an inadequate deduction of intermediate products in them. At the&#13;
same time, housing services appear to be undervalued because all housing,&#13;
including that occupied by owners which is not subsidized, is valued in prices&#13;
for state-subsidized rentals.&#13;
The Romanian method of estimating value-added in foreign trade, in&#13;
common with that used in most other CMEA countries, tends to result in&#13;
unusually large annual fluctuations in income from the sector because domestic&#13;
prices are not adjusted automatically when foreign prices fluctuate. In&#13;
addition, the method of adjusting for so-called "price differences" biases GDP&#13;
estimates. In the Romanian case the bias in 1979 and 1980 was as much as 2-3&#13;
percent upward.&#13;
Growth rates of GDP estimate' by the Romanian CSO have the same&#13;
biases as the country's growth rates of NMP. Until 1981 one such bias was the&#13;
use of out-of-date price weights. A second probably comes from the very large&#13;
share of "new" products in each year's assortment of industrial output. In&#13;
the second case there is no way to estimate possible biases short of an&#13;
independent study of Romanian product-designation and pricing practices.&#13;
Whatever may be the sources of bias, the official growth rate is higher than&#13;
either alternative. It shows an average annual rate for the period 1950 to&#13;
1973 of 8.5 percent. An estimate of the UN/ECE using the PIG method is 5.9&#13;
percent and that of the Alton Group 4.8 percent for the same period.&#13;
The Romanian CSO estimate of the country's per capita GDP in 1980&#13;
might be converted from NCUs to US dollars by any of four alternative exchange&#13;
rates: (1) the official commercial rate (18 lei/$); (2) the average ratio of&#13;
internal and external prices of imports and exports for convertible currencies&#13;
(12.16 lei/$); (3) the purchasing power parity estimated by the rate from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Phase III of the ICP in 1975 moved forward to 1980 by the ratio of growth of&#13;
Romanian prices compared to US prices (6.3 lei/$); and (4) some version of (3)&#13;
adjusted by an estimate of exchange rate deviation in order to meet the&#13;
conceptual standards of exchange rates used in the World Bank Atlas. Applying&#13;
such rates results in a range of estimates from $1,551 per capita using the&#13;
official commercial rate to $4,432 per capita using the ICP/PPP moved forward&#13;
to 1980. The Romanian government favors using the official commercial rate, a&#13;
rate which was reduced to 15 lei/$ in 1981 and then raised, reaching 17.50&#13;
lei/$ on July 1, 1983. As long as Romania follows a policy of actively&#13;
adjusting this rate to movements in the average realized ratio of domestic to&#13;
international prices of exports and imports, it may serve relatively well for&#13;
international comparisons of GDP values.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Until 1981 the available record of Romania's national product and&#13;
income was one of the least complete in Europe. Its Central Statistical&#13;
Office (CSO) released less information in 1972 than in 1962, and only limited&#13;
explanations and definitions were provided. Even in the latest available (at&#13;
the time of writing) Romanian Statistical Yearbook (as shown in Table 1), one&#13;
dated 1983 with data for up to 1982, there are published only (1) indices of&#13;
growth in so-called "comparable" prices, (2) percentage shares by sectors of&#13;
origin in current prices, and (3) annual absolute values for total net&#13;
material product (NMP) in a variety of non-comparable prices.&#13;
Somewhat better economic information has been released indirectly on&#13;
a "confidential basis." This was the case with information released to the&#13;
IMF after Romania joined in 1972, although since 1981 the IMF began to release&#13;
limited series in the International Financial Statistics. Similar&#13;
information, still "confidential", appeared in Romanian Economic Memorandum&#13;
circulated in 1982 and 1983 to banks as part of the country's foreign debt&#13;
rescheduling. A third release was done by the Romanian CSO as part of this&#13;
project at the request of the World Bank. The latter appear in Tables 22&#13;
through 25, and are explained in more detail below.&#13;
Romania is committed to the banks to circulate the "confidential"&#13;
Economic Memorandum and to supply a few pieces of data to the IMF for&#13;
publication in IFS. But as late as November 1983, that publication still had&#13;
not given data for 1982. It is therefore uncertain at this time whether it&#13;
will be possible to up-date the information in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
The length of this paper is partly justified by the incompleteness of&#13;
existing information on the Romanian national accounts. Detailed explanations&#13;
are also necessary because the estimates of GNP/GDP presented in the paper are&#13;
based on the Romanian net material product accounts. They carry all the of&#13;
Q those accounts, including the sectoral allocation of activities and the&#13;
Romanian system of price evaluations.&#13;
The first section of the paper describes the Romanian net material&#13;
product accounts. This is followed by a section on the estimates of GDP&#13;
derived by the Romanian CSO from its net material product accounts. A third&#13;
section evaluates and compares the growth rates of the official national&#13;
product estimates. Finally, a fourth section reviews and explains the&#13;
available exchange rates for transforming accounts valued in the Romanian&#13;
domestic currency unit, the leu (plural lei), into US dollars. A more&#13;
detailed discussion of Romanian prices is/presented in Annex I.&#13;
II. THE ROMANIAN NET MATERiIAL PRODUCT ACCOUNTS&#13;
The net material product concept differs from GDP/GNP primarily&#13;
because it excludes (1) depreciation and (2) most services. In the case of&#13;
depreciation, the Romanian CSO publishes no data directly. Some values for&#13;
services rendered to households for payment, part of total final services,&#13;
have been published since the statistical yearbook of 1979; the value of&#13;
services rendered through the budget have been published regularly. Questions&#13;
of how both depreciation and services have and ought to be valued will be&#13;
discussed in detail in the following section. Here the issue is the content&#13;
of the accounts without them: (1) NMP "produced" or by sectors of origin, in&#13;
current prices, (2) NMP "used" or as the flows of final material products to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
consumption, investment and net exports, also in current prices, and (3) both&#13;
NMP "produced" and "used" in constant prices.&#13;
A. Net Material Product in Current Prices&#13;
Romanian NMP produced (venitul national) is calculated by the pro-&#13;
duction method beginning with the "gross output" (produsul global) of each&#13;
branch of material production, the sum of which across all branches is called&#13;
"osocial product" (produsul social). 1/ NMP is derived by subtracting from&#13;
gross output the amounts of "material expenditures" (cheltuielile materiale)&#13;
consisting of fixed capital depreciation and material purchases.&#13;
The Romanian accounting methodology has undergone two major changes&#13;
during the 1970s. One will be referred to as the "1971-75" methodology and&#13;
the other the "1976-80" methodology.    The structure of NMP by sectors of&#13;
origin in current prices is shown in both methodologies in Table 1. In both&#13;
cases, the new methods were introduced after the beginning of a period and&#13;
conforming recalculations made for earlier years.    The years, 1970 and 1975-&#13;
1976, were calculated in both old and new methods. There will probably be a&#13;
new methodology introduced for the 1980s. 2/&#13;
The principal changes in 1970 (and sometimes a few years later) were&#13;
numerous additions to the realm of "productive activities" and a few changes&#13;
1/ The distinction is made below between "gross output" which is net of&#13;
subsidies and includes turnover taxes, and "gross production" (productia&#13;
globala) which includes subsidies and not turnover taxes. Growth indices&#13;
and the absolute values of the latter are published for industry and&#13;
agriculture in Romania's Statistical Yearbook.&#13;
2/ In fact, as noted in Table 5, there was a shift in the attribution of&#13;
transportation activities in 1980, a change unmentioned in the Statistical&#13;
Yearbook of 1981 (with data through 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
in the means of valuation of activities. They were as follows (as far as has&#13;
been determined in this study):&#13;
-  the inclusion in "productive activities" of (a) activities of units&#13;
serving agriculture (agricultural mechanization stations, enterprises&#13;
for the maintenance and operation of irrigation systems, veterinarian&#13;
dispensaries, centers for pest control, etc.); (b) passenger transporta-&#13;
tion and of telecommunications serving the public; (c) services for the&#13;
operation of ports and airports; (d) services of hotels and spas; (e)&#13;
scientific research serving production and of the services of computing&#13;
centers; (f) current repairs of roads, bridges and streets financed from&#13;
budget funds; (g) food processing in the canteens of hospitals and&#13;
schools; (h) activities of laundries, cleaners, painters and photography&#13;
workshops serving the public; and (i) household processing of purchased&#13;
fibers and textiles;&#13;
- the re-evaluation of (a) the production of private artisans; (b)&#13;
construction of housing by private parties and construction through&#13;
"patriotic" labor; (c) agricultural production from private and personal&#13;
farming; and (d) consumption of agricultural produce in the field&#13;
(before harvest) by humans and animals.&#13;
The effects of some of these changes produced deviations in the&#13;
Romanian methodology from that recommended by CMEA. While no exhaustive&#13;
survey of the latter has been made as part of this project, some of the known&#13;
differences are as follows:&#13;
- the Romanian inclusion in "productive activities" of (a) passenger&#13;
transportation, (b) telecommunications for the public, (c) hotels and&#13;
spas, (d) science serving production, (e) repair and maintenance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
roads and bridges from budget funds, (f) industrial activities in&#13;
government administrative offices such as printing and repairing;&#13;
-  the Romanian attribution of project making to "other" (CMEA to&#13;
"construction"), of laundries and photographic workshops to "other"&#13;
(CMEA to "industry");&#13;
- possibly the treatment of the activities of agricultural mechanization&#13;
services and other units serving agriculture from budget-finance.&#13;
The principal changes in the 1976-80 methodology are not explained in&#13;
the Romanian statistical yearbooks, making their identification more uncer-&#13;
tain. As far as has been determined in this study they are as follows:&#13;
- the reallocation of so-called "differences in prices" arising in foreign&#13;
trade from the foreign trade sector alone to the sectors to whose&#13;
account exporting and importing is charged (before this change in some&#13;
years NMP originating in foreign trade had been negative; the data are&#13;
unavailable but note should be taken of the behavior of foreign trade&#13;
sector shares in Table 1);&#13;
-  the elimination of harvest losses in agricultural output and in the&#13;
accounts of NMP used; 1/&#13;
-  a shift to different methods of pricing, to be discussed more completely&#13;
below.&#13;
1/ Information was given during the author's discussions with Romanian&#13;
authorities that these changes took place with the evaluation of&#13;
consumption by the population and the inclusion of before-harvest&#13;
consumption from fields by humans and animals. It is yet not known if&#13;
these were additional changes to those mentioned in the statistical&#13;
Yearbook of 1974.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Additional details of the contents of Romanian NMP produced are more&#13;
easily indicated for each of the major sectors of material production.&#13;
(i) Industry. NMP produced in Romanian industry is based on accounting&#13;
reports (dare de seama) submitted by enterprises having industrial production&#13;
plus other industrial activities estimated by the central statistical&#13;
office. The reported data begin with "gross industrial production" (productia&#13;
globala industriala) from which is subtracted material expenditures to derive&#13;
"inet industrial production" (produsul net in industrie). The latter has,&#13;
since 1978, become an important plan indicator and since 1980 completely&#13;
replaces the former in plan reports. Both gross and net industrial production&#13;
are reported in "enterprise wholesale prices" (known since 1971 as "prices of&#13;
production" or preturile de productie).&#13;
The addition of turnover taxes and the elimination of subsidies from&#13;
the state budget converts enterprise wholesale prices into "industry wholesale&#13;
prices", now called simply "delivery prices" (in place of preturi cu ridicata&#13;
de industrie is used preturile de livrare). The same addition of turnover&#13;
taxes and the elimination of subsidies from gross industrial production and&#13;
net industrial production results, respectively, in the values of "gross&#13;
output from industry" (produsul global din industrie) and NMP from industry&#13;
(venitul national din industrie). These values in current prices and&#13;
according to the 1976-80 methodology are presented in Table 2 along with&#13;
similar values from the other branches of the economy.&#13;
Gross industrial production in Romania covers the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
- socialist industry (from industrial enterprises and from units of other&#13;
enterprises and organizations in non-industrial sectors) as well as&#13;
small-scale private industry and non-cooperative artisans;&#13;
- all industrial production from such units including changes in&#13;
inventories of finished goods and goods in process;&#13;
- items such as bricks from construction enterprises, printing and&#13;
repairing in state administrative offices, repairs in agricultural&#13;
mechanization stations and other agricultural units, the production of&#13;
construction materials and food processing by agricultural units;&#13;
- private artisan repair services;&#13;
- production of bricks and other items for personal use by farmers.&#13;
In industry NMP is calculated by the income approach as well as the&#13;
production approach (in fact, before 1960 this was the only way). Corrections&#13;
have to be made as in the case, for example, when the wages fund reported by&#13;
the Ministry of Labor contains premia not covered by the wages fund reported&#13;
by industry. Greater emphasis has been given to the income side because, as&#13;
mentioned, it is part of the "New Economic Mechanism" as reflected at the&#13;
enterprise level in net production. NMP from the income side includes the&#13;
following accounts:&#13;
- wages and salaries&#13;
- contributions to social insurance&#13;
- profit&#13;
- turnover taxes&#13;
- the tax on net product (a recent innovation called prelevarea pentru&#13;
societate a unei parti din valuarea neta);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
- contributions to ministerial-level funds to support contract research&#13;
for new technology (sums considered as part of material expenditures of&#13;
a branch of industry in the aggregation of accounts).&#13;
(ii) Agriculture. Romanian practice distinguishes two concepts of&#13;
gross production in agriculture. "Cross agricultural production" (productia&#13;
globala agricola) is the sum of crop and animal output gross of the parts of&#13;
them consumed in agriculture. To this is added the values of agricultural&#13;
services supported from the state budget and the services of agricultural&#13;
mechanization stations (considered as material expenditures in the units they&#13;
serve). This sum is called "agricultural production" (productia agricola).&#13;
With turnover taxes (small in agriculture) added and subsidies eliminated,&#13;
"agricultural production" becomes "gross output from agriculture" (produsul&#13;
global din agricultura), shown in Table 2.&#13;
Gross agricultural production includes such items as increases in&#13;
permanent animal herds. Since 1970, crop output is supposed to have been&#13;
reported in "barn yield" and so should not include normal losses during&#13;
harvesting and transportation to supply depots. However, the size of such&#13;
losses has recently been so great as to cause complaints from the highest&#13;
levels of the Romanian government. Since at least 1975, additions have been&#13;
made for crops consumed in the fields by humans and animals. No estimates of&#13;
such consumption have been published. Also, worth noting is the likelihood&#13;
that Romanian crops are not reported in standard quality units such as grain&#13;
of a standard moisture content.&#13;
Crops and animal output is reported for three kinds of organizational&#13;
units: (1) state units, most of which are state farms (state agricultural&#13;
enterprises) but included are others such as experimental stations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
(2) agricultural cooperatives, including the activities of inter-cooperative&#13;
associations; and (3) personal and private farm activities. Production&#13;
estimates cover both delivered or marketed output and output consumed by farm&#13;
units. In the latter case, only that consumed by humans enters net output or&#13;
NMP produced in agriculture.&#13;
Since 1955/56 the value of agricultural production in current prices&#13;
has been estimated in prices differentiated for kinds of organizational units&#13;
and for zones of the country. Production from state units, all of which is&#13;
supposed to be delivered to the state fund, is valued at "delivery prices"&#13;
(preturile de livare) for "marketed production" (productiei marfa) and at&#13;
"costs of production" (preturi de cost) for non-marketed output. The&#13;
production of other agricultural units is evaluated at "average realized&#13;
prices" (preturi medie de realizare). In the case of marketed production of&#13;
agricultural cooperatives two prices are used, either "contract" (contractare)&#13;
prices or "purchase" (achizionare) prices. The latter are higher prices for&#13;
incentives.   Production of cooperatives that is consumed for productive&#13;
purposes (seeds, animal feed, etc.) is valued at the average of contract and&#13;
purchase prices, considered as delivery prices. Production of cooperatives&#13;
distributed to members is valued at prices in the "peasant market" (piata&#13;
taraneasca). Prices in such markets were said by Romanian authorities to have&#13;
averaged 2 or 3 times those for similar products sold through the socialist&#13;
retail network (milk, for example, was said to sell for'2.3 lei per liter in&#13;
the latter and 5.0 lei per liter in the former), although Romanian does not&#13;
publish data on these prices.   Unlike other prices, peasant market prices are&#13;
market prices (within limits of avoiding speculation, as officially&#13;
explained.) Their values along with estimates of the amounts of produce sold&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
in them are derived from sample studies of 95 markets made on the 5th, 15th&#13;
and 25th days of each month.&#13;
Production from personal (meaning the garden plots of members of&#13;
agricultural cooperatives) and private farms, collectively referred to as&#13;
gospodarile populatiei (literally, "household economies of the population"),&#13;
is all valued at weighted average prices for deliveries to the state fund and&#13;
in peasant markets (preturi medii de realizare a productiei marfa in&#13;
gospodarile agricole ale populatiei). The production so valued includes both&#13;
productive and human consumption and marketed output. The estimate of self-&#13;
consumption is based on family budget studies.&#13;
(iii) Construction. The activities covered in the construction&#13;
branch of NMP produced include the following:&#13;
- the production of construction and installation done both by specialized&#13;
construction enterprises and by other enterprises for their own account&#13;
(in regia);&#13;
- construction services such as that for repairs of housing;&#13;
- geological drilling and exploring;&#13;
- other construction work such as that done by agricultural cooperatives&#13;
and families for their own account, capital and current repairs financed&#13;
by the state budget for roads and bridges, and "patriotic" construction&#13;
work.&#13;
It may be noted that unfinished construction, no matter which bene-&#13;
fiting branch, is considered as part of the gross construction production.&#13;
The prices used to measure the current value of construction are so-called&#13;
"list prices" (preturile de deviz).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv) Transportation. As in industry, NMP in transportation is now&#13;
measured by both the production and income approaches. Gross production in&#13;
transportation includes the following activities:&#13;
- those executed by units of the Ministry of Transportation for both&#13;
production and the public;&#13;
- private cartage and transportation done by agricultural cooperatives;&#13;
- maintenance activities inside ports and airports;&#13;
- until 1980, transportation activities of the economic ministries with&#13;
their own units.&#13;
Transportation activities are valued according to the realized&#13;
tariffs. There recently have been only insignificant subsidies, according to&#13;
Romanian officials.&#13;
(v) Communications. NMP in communications until 1970 included&#13;
postal, telegraphic and telephonic services for "productive" uses, both those&#13;
rendered by specialized units of the Minsitry of Communications and by in-&#13;
house units of other productive agencies. After 1970 services used by&#13;
households were included. However, it is unclear if radio and television&#13;
services are included.&#13;
(vi) Domestic Trade. The major source of production in the domestic&#13;
trade sector comes from the wholesale and retail trade (including hotels and&#13;
restaurants) undertaken by units of the Ministry of Domestic Trade and the&#13;
People's Councils of Municipalities and Districts. Sometimes these activities&#13;
are also undertaken by industrial units, usually in retail trade. A second&#13;
major form of domestic trade production covers the units involved in&#13;
technical-material supply while a third covers specialized units for the&#13;
acquisition through contracting and purchase of agricultural products for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
state fund. There remains only insignificant private trade legally conducted&#13;
in the country.&#13;
(vii) Foreign Trade. Until 1975 the gross material production in&#13;
Romanian foreign trade included three categories: (1) gross trade margins or&#13;
commissions, (2)"taxes" minus "subsidies" on exports and imports, (3) a&#13;
special charge or credit reflecting the estimated internal cost or benefit of&#13;
foreign currency gains or losses, called "differences in prices". These items&#13;
are explained more fully in Section V of the paper. In the case of (2),&#13;
''taxes" minus "subsidies" are based on the differences in domestic and foreign&#13;
prices of imports and exports. The sums can be quite large. As already&#13;
mentioned, the practice of charging differences in prices to the foreign trade&#13;
sector alone was eliminated in the 1976-80 methodology; they are now&#13;
attributed to the sectors benefiting from exports and imports.&#13;
(viii) Other Sector. The "other" sector in Romania covers the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
- household industry in agricultural families for consumption and sale;&#13;
- computer centers, specialized research and project making;&#13;
- printing, photographic workshops, chemical cleaning and laundries.&#13;
Additional details on the content of NMP produced will be discussed&#13;
following a brief comment on the other two approaches to NMP shown in Tables 3&#13;
through 4.&#13;
B. NMP Used in Current Prices&#13;
Romanian statistical authorities have published less information in&#13;
the Statistical Yearbook about NMP by use than NMP produced and nothing&#13;
whatsoever about NMP distributed. Information on NMP by use has been limited&#13;
to five-year average shares (percentage) of the consumption and accumulation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
funds, without indication of net exports and statistical discrepancy.&#13;
Otherwise, one finds numerous citations in secondary literature which are dis-&#13;
couragingly contradictory and lacking definition. Some data did appear in the&#13;
Economic Memorandum covering values in current prices for 1975-81. More&#13;
detail is found in Table 3 with values in constant prices in Table 6.&#13;
The consumption fund excludes non-productive services, like those of&#13;
the hairdresser and the teacher, and values material consumption in prices&#13;
used for production. That part of it from personal income, in money and in&#13;
kind, covers the following items:&#13;
-  sales of products in socialist retail trade;&#13;
-  sales of products in peasant market;&#13;
-  self-consumption by producers (most agricultural goods);&#13;
-  purchases of so-called productive services such as repairs;&#13;
-  the attribution of the material portions of services like health care&#13;
and education for which there are only partial fees.&#13;
The second item under the consumption fund covers the material part&#13;
of state administration, military defense, and other items not attributable to&#13;
individuals.&#13;
A difference is found in the volume of retail sales by the socialist&#13;
trade network, an item published regularly in the statistical yearbook, and&#13;
the amounts included in the consumption fund. Some retail sales are for&#13;
productive consumption (intermediate products) such as animal feed, fuel, and&#13;
construction materials purchased both by agricultural cooperatives and private&#13;
farmers. They are eliminated as are similar sales through the peasant market.&#13;
Also included in both categories of the consumption fund are imputa-&#13;
tions for the depreciation of structures, housing and public buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Little comment is offered about the accumulation fund. Its value is&#13;
obviously influenced by changes in depreciation, rates of which were revised&#13;
downward as part of the 1977 price reforms (about which more will be said).&#13;
It may also be noted that changes in the volume of unfinished investments,&#13;
including uninstalled equipment, are attributed on the production side to&#13;
production in the construction sector.&#13;
As is common practice in CMEA countries, Romania accounts for NMP&#13;
distributed only in current prices. The values shown in Table 4 are the first&#13;
published for Romania as far as is known. They show the primary distribution&#13;
of the value of material production before the redistributions of sums through&#13;
the state budget and through expenditures for non-productive services. The&#13;
main interest in them for this study is their reflection of charges included&#13;
in the value of production. Items that are included in the primary incomes of&#13;
organizations are:&#13;
- profits (including sums paid as taxes out of profits);&#13;
- turnover taxes;&#13;
- contributions to social insurance&#13;
- taxes on wages and salaries (since 1978 paid by employers);&#13;
- the balance of interest.&#13;
Items covered in NMP distributed to persons include:&#13;
- incomes in money and kind from labor on agricultural cooperatives;&#13;
- wages and salaries;&#13;
- the net product of private and personal farming and other production;&#13;
- other items including payments for work assignments away from home.&#13;
A full release of data on NMP distributed by years and by sectors of&#13;
production, would provide a useful means for analyzing the factor-cost content&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
of the Romanian accounts. The data would have to be used together with some&#13;
meaningful information on the value of capital funds by sector. Such&#13;
information is also yet to be published for Romania (See additional discussion&#13;
of Table 34 in Section V below).&#13;
C. NMP in Constant Prices&#13;
The basis of calculations of growth rates in Romania in recent years&#13;
has been the so-called "comparable prices of 1963" (as modified in 1965) which&#13;
were used from 1965 through 1976. In 1977, a new price base, prices of&#13;
January 1, 1977, was introduced. As Tables 5 and 6 show, calculations were&#13;
extended back to 1975 for the official link to the former system of prices and&#13;
accounting methodology. After 1980 growth is measured in 1981 prices. The&#13;
details of the links between the series remain unpublished except as shown by&#13;
the shares in current prices. Of course, they explain nothing about the&#13;
values in constant prices.&#13;
The price system introduced in 1977 mandated that prices be changed&#13;
annually.  Work for each year's new prices begins the previous July.       In&#13;
consequence, data are now published in prices of each January 1st.       Such&#13;
prices are not current prices in as much as some prices can and do change&#13;
during the course of the following year. They are called "planning prices," a&#13;
name which refers to one of their main functions.      Annual plans are now&#13;
compiled in their terms and plan fulfillment also so reported. For example,&#13;
output in 1978 (Q78) would be valued in planning prices of January 1, 1979&#13;
(Q78 P79) and compa;red to planned and achieved output in 1979 in January 1,&#13;
1979 prices (Q79 P79). Nevertheless, growth rate calculations are based on&#13;
January 1, 1977 prices so the growth rate from 1978 to 1979 would be the&#13;
result of comparing (Q78 P77) with (Q79 P77).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Calculating output in constant prices is done differently for&#13;
agriculture and household industry than for the other sectors of NMP.    Their&#13;
special arrangement reflects the relatively primitive state of accounting in&#13;
the private, personal and cooperative units that provide the bulk of&#13;
agricultural output. Real NMP calculations are done by the central&#13;
statistical office using physical output and material expenditure series and&#13;
the relevant set of constant prices. One methodological innovation was&#13;
reported to the author by Romanian authorities in 1980. Up to 1977, a single&#13;
price had been used for one kind of product regardless of where it was&#13;
produced or what kind of organization produced it. But beginning that year&#13;
calculations were based on differentiated constant prices, and the method was&#13;
extended back to 1975.&#13;
Enterprises in industry and the other non-agricultural sectors of the&#13;
Romania economy are now said to be required to report their output (in gross&#13;
terms) and their material expenditures in current or effective prices, in&#13;
planning prices and in constant or comparable prices. 1/ Also, as part of the&#13;
reporting system each enterprise and other economic unit is responsible for&#13;
1/ The author of this paper admits to a continuing confusion about how the&#13;
system of calculation of constant prices works or has worked. One&#13;
authority, Dr. Gheorghe Sica of the State Planning Committee, wrote in a&#13;
recent book that "gross industrial production is expressed in comparable&#13;
prices and since 1974 is also calculated in current prices." (See his&#13;
Procese ale economisirii muncii sociale (Bucharest, 1977), p. 161). In&#13;
1982, another Romanian authority stated flatly that "about 15 years ago&#13;
enterprises gave up constant prices." At the Central Statistical Office in&#13;
1980, the author was informed that up to 1977 the enterprises calculated&#13;
both gross and net output in current and constant prices and the Central&#13;
Statistical Office merely aggregated the reports. It began to calculate&#13;
net output and NMP produced in industry in 1977 using enterprise and&#13;
ministry data on gross output and material expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
documenting a report on the "influence of prices" (abatere de preturi) on the&#13;
value of output.&#13;
The reports on output.in the various prices and on the influences of&#13;
prices are submitted up through the ministries and for final aggregation and&#13;
correction by the central statistical office. It estimates both social&#13;
product and material expenditures as summations of the sectors in real terms&#13;
and then derives real NMP produced (as shown in Table 6) as their difference.&#13;
In addition to reports of the values of output and material expendi-&#13;
tures, the CSO in recent years has calculated indices of producers' prices in&#13;
industry based on marketed output. It follows the output of individual pro-&#13;
ducts in physical terms, quarterly for some 800 products and annually for&#13;
about 2,000 products.&#13;
A critical and much criticized element in the Romanian system for&#13;
calculating changes in real NMP produced is the control of pricing for new or&#13;
changed products. The dimension of the phenomenon is suggested by the figures&#13;
in Table 7. They would seem to indicate that as much as half of Romania's&#13;
assortment of industrial products is renewed in each five-year period. The&#13;
problem is that there have been and still are strong inducements throughout&#13;
the Romanian organizational system to use the occasion of a product change to&#13;
actually raise prices. Outside observers of Romania's high industrial growth&#13;
rates suggest that part of the growth is unmeasured price increases. The&#13;
Alton data, based on recalculations using published Romanian physical output&#13;
series, and the UN PIG calculations both support this view, but they are short&#13;
of series in the rapidly growing areas of machinery and electronics. In as&#13;
much as no additional evidence has been produced in this study, the best that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
can be done is to describe some of the general features of the Romanian system&#13;
of price setting.&#13;
The present system for approving prices was set out in Decree # 388&#13;
of 1972. The system distributes authority for prices throughout the&#13;
organization including some prices which can only be changed by the President&#13;
or the Council of Ministers.    However, most prices are set and changed by the&#13;
ministries and the peoples' councils (at the district level) with approval of&#13;
the State Committee on Prices. Both have the right, often exercised, to&#13;
delegate price setting and changing to even lower levels, to centrals and&#13;
enterprises. Romanian authorities have explained that delegation of price&#13;
setting is as much a function of the technical capabilities of the lower units&#13;
as any other consideration.    Delegation is said to be common for new models&#13;
after a basic product has had a price set at the central level.&#13;
Under a special system set up in 1974 the State Committee on Prices&#13;
published branch norms in order to keep the prices of new products at the same&#13;
price level. Basic products used in the system are denominated produse de&#13;
talon, or "reference products." Price variations may be set at lower levels&#13;
by methods of correlation published for each branch, requiring comparisons of&#13;
both the cost- and use-values of new products with the standard or "reference&#13;
product." In the system, not all prices have to be reported to the State&#13;
Price Committee. Instead, it is responsible for spot checking both&#13;
producerand retail prices. 1/ Clearly this task, hardly simple in any case,&#13;
must have&#13;
1/ The main responsibility for setting retail prices falls on the Ministry of&#13;
Domestic Trade. It, too, delegates price setting, with regional price&#13;
variations permitted.&#13;

become more difficult now that annual prices changes are mandated and have&#13;
grown in dimension, at least since 1980.&#13;

III. THE ESTIMATES OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN DOMESTIC CURRENCY&#13;
The estimates of Romanian gross domestic product (produs intern brut)&#13;
released for this study are presented in Tables 22 through 25. They follow&#13;
the methodology described in a set of papers published by the Central&#13;
Statistical Office in 1977. 1/ Probably at that time the Romanian CSO&#13;
experimented with such calculations even though no actual numbers were&#13;
published. 2/&#13;
Tables 22 and 23 show the essential steps in the estimation of GDP in&#13;
1979 and 1980 by adding net non-material services and depreciation to the&#13;
official figures for NMP produced.   The procedure includes the subtraction of&#13;
non-material services, mostly financial, from the material production sectors&#13;
where they had entered the initial calculation of value-added in NMP pro-&#13;
duced. As far as is known, the estimates have not been corrected for (a) net&#13;
exports of services, (b) some categories of losses, and (c) business travel&#13;
expenditures. Housing is probably included at "realized prices," which may&#13;
include operating losses covered by budget subsidies.&#13;

of international comparisons, including the systems of national accounts,&#13;
through the European Statistical Association.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Tables 24 and 25 round out the estimates released for this study by&#13;
the Romanian CSO. Table 24 provides one view of the GDP estimate from the use&#13;
or expenditure side. The small differences in the service and depreciation&#13;
values in it compared to Tables 22 and 23 is explained as a shift of about 1.5&#13;
billion lei of depreciation in vineyards to consumption. Table 25 gives&#13;
summary estimates of both sides of the accounts in current prices from 1975 to&#13;
1980. It is important to observe in Tables 24 and 25 that the concepts of&#13;
expenditures on services does not include the full final value of what would&#13;
be considered as "services" in western national accounting. The material cost&#13;
of services is included in the "consumption fund." The values for services&#13;
include only labor costs and net operating surpluses. Table 26 provides a&#13;
clearer identification of the categories of goods and services.&#13;
No estimates from the income side of the accounts were provided by&#13;
the Romanian CSO for this study and no attempt is made to estimate them.&#13;
Data for 1981 and 1982 have appeared in the Romanian Economic&#13;
Memorandum May, 1982, and February, 1983, for net non-material services&#13;
produced and depreciation. However no detailed breakdowns such as those in&#13;
Tables 22 and 23 have been released.&#13;
A. Problems in the Estimation of the Service Accounts&#13;
The data on the service sectors in Tables 22-25 are clearly&#13;
insufficient to give confidence in their meaning or quality. They were&#13;
provided with no written explanation whatsoever and without an opportunity for&#13;
a sufficient verbal clarification of what can be seen as significant problems&#13;
in them. Some of the problems are readily identified.&#13;
1. Value-Added in Services vs. Services Consumed. Table 27 shows the need&#13;
for better definition of the Romanian data. The numbers in the upper part of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the table indicate both total value-added in services (as shown in Table 24),&#13;
61.2 billion lei in 1980, and the part not used as intermediate products in&#13;
the material sectors, 43.2 billion lei. The latter are part of "services&#13;
used" or final expenditures on services. However, the sums are only part of&#13;
such final expenditures representing the non-material component, mostly labor&#13;
costs and possibly some net operating surplus. In addition, final&#13;
expenditures on services include a material component. The only information&#13;
available on the material component is found in Tables 3 and 5 as "material&#13;
consumption of budget organizations." Inasmuch as the content of this item&#13;
remains undefined, one cannot be sure if it is all used for services. No&#13;
information has been found on the material component of services used by&#13;
households and other non-governmental organizations.&#13;
2. Supporting Data For The Service Estimates. In Tables 22-25 data on total&#13;
services and the four major categories of services are given for only two&#13;
years, 1979 and 1980.    Net services are given for the period from 1975 to&#13;
1980. Longer and more detailed time series are needed and were requested but&#13;
not supplied by the Romanian CSO. Moreover it turns out that such series can&#13;
not be estimated by reference to information normally published in Romania's&#13;
statistical yearbook.&#13;
Two major categories of data on services found in the Romanian&#13;
statistical yearbook are presented in Tables 28 and 29. Table 28 gives the&#13;
values of services purchased by households from socialist organizations. A&#13;
large part of them fall in the category of "material services" and hence are&#13;
included in net material product. The separation of this category in the&#13;
upper part of the table from the "non-material services" in the lower part of&#13;
the table follows the author's best judgement. It is not so indicated in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Romanian statistical yearbook.&#13;
Table 29 shows state-budget expenditures on non-material services and&#13;
includes as well information from Table 6 on the material consumption of&#13;
budgetary units counted in net material product. The latter figures are not&#13;
found in the Romanian statistical yearbook.&#13;
Attempts to compare these and a few other indicators of services with&#13;
the service data from Tables 22-25 is made in Table 30. A reasonable&#13;
identification can be made in cases of "government services" and "housing,&#13;
communal and other services" but not "cultural services." No information on&#13;
"financial services" can be found in the statistical yearbook.&#13;
The first part of Table 30 adds purchases by households of "non-&#13;
material services" to apparent "value-added in non-material services" by&#13;
organizations supported through the state budget (budget expenditures minus&#13;
material consumption). This sum is seen to be only about half the net value-&#13;
added in non-material services in Tables 22-25. It suggests that the figures&#13;
of valued-added by the Romanian CSO are over-estimated, possibly because&#13;
purchases of intermediate products are included in them.&#13;
Next, in Table 30, "government services" are compared with state-&#13;
budget expenditures on administration and defense. The "fit" is very close,&#13;
suggesting again the possibility that intermediate products have been included&#13;
in the service estimates of Tables 22-25.&#13;
Value-added in "housing, communal and other personal services" seems&#13;
to match fairly closely the value of such services purchased by households&#13;
from socialist units (given in Table 28). In this comparison an estimate of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the wage bill is also given. Value-added in this area does appear to be&#13;
nearly all labor services. 1/&#13;
There are no correlations evident in the information on "cultural&#13;
services" (including health, welfare, culture, sports, and education). The&#13;
sum of household and budget expenditures on this category of services is&#13;
greater than value-added, as might be expected. But the wage bill is much&#13;
smaller than value-added, suggesting an unexpectedly large share of non-labor&#13;
factor services or net enterprise income. Possibly some less obvious&#13;
"cultural" occupation of persons was deleted in the calculated wage bill.&#13;
3. Evaluation of Housing Services. Data from ICP shown in Table 8 indicates&#13;
that relative rents in 1975 were extremely low in Romania. At the same time&#13;
the relative price of residential construction was exceptionally high. If&#13;
such relatively high residential construction costs had been characteristic of&#13;
Romania for a long period, then very low rates of return on housing capital&#13;
are implied. Both rents and costs of housing investment rose around 20&#13;
percent from 1975 to 1980, as suggested in Tables 9 and 17.&#13;
While such low returns may be taken as an indication of state social&#13;
or incomes policy with large housing subsidies, the matter is more&#13;
complicated. Since the early 1970s state policy has encouraged and even&#13;
forced large numbers of families to purchase the apartments they live in. The&#13;
cost of such housing has not generally been subsidized. Instead it has&#13;
reflected the relatively high residential construction cost reflected in the&#13;
ICP figures. Consequently, since the state provides a shrinking number of&#13;
1/ The wage bill is calculated from the number of persons occupied in the&#13;
sector and their average wage. Both are given in the Statistical Yearbook.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
houses at subsidized rents while forcing greater numbers to purchase high-cost&#13;
houses, it is incorrect to impute the low rents to all housing. By the same&#13;
argument one may say that the relative rent figure from the ICP is biased. It&#13;
is too low.&#13;
Additional aspects of the problems of evaluating services are seen in&#13;
the following comparisons of the Romanian CSO estimates of GDP with those of&#13;
the World Bank Staff and the Alton Group.&#13;
B. Comparisons with the World Bank Staff Estimates&#13;
Some recent estimates of Romania's GNP by the World Bank Staff are&#13;
found in Table 31. The data are in constant 1963 prices, although it turns&#13;
out that the depreciation figures in them are also current price magnitudes.&#13;
The growth rates estimated by the World Bank Staff are considered below and in&#13;
Table 40.&#13;
Table 32 presents a comparative view of the figures for 1975 with the&#13;
CSO data in 1975 current prices. Clearly, the two sets of figures are not&#13;
actually comparable. The purpose of viewing them together is merely to draw&#13;
attention to the much larger "gross" or "total" service figures estimates of&#13;
the Bank staff. It is also evident that their estimates overlook the element&#13;
of non-material services already in NMP.&#13;
C. Comparison with the Alton Group Estimates&#13;
Only the current value of GDP in lei and its structure is of concern&#13;
in Tables 33, 34 and 35. Comparative growth rates will be discussed&#13;
separately below.&#13;
Table 33 gives comparative figures for 1975, but with Alton-Group&#13;
base data since revised. In fairness to the Alton Group it must be emphasized&#13;
that they did not have access to the official data in the 1976-80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
methodology. They were forced to use ratios derived from Bulgarian data in&#13;
cases noted in the table. Their estimate of non-material services is&#13;
considerably larger than the official figure.&#13;
Table 34 presents the latest Alton Group estimates in comparative&#13;
perspective. Two points are important. First, the relative amounts of value-&#13;
added in industry and agriculture differ greatly. Only part of this shift is&#13;
due to a likely overstatement of labor returns in agriculture by the Alton&#13;
Group. They use the Romanian statistical yearbook figures for occupied&#13;
population in agriculture and average wages paid to state employees. The&#13;
occupied figure contains many part-time persons, while the average wage of&#13;
state employees is significantly higher than average incomes of both workers&#13;
and peasants in this sector. It appears likely that this is the principal&#13;
difference in the value of payments to persons in NMP ("primary incomes of the&#13;
population") of 216.2 billion lei, given by the Romanian CSO in Table 4, and&#13;
the higher total of 246.8 billion lei of factor payments to labor, as&#13;
estimated by Alton.&#13;
The second important feature of Table 34 is the great difference in&#13;
the values of services, especially those in "housing, communal and other."&#13;
This feature is explored further in Table 35. The first column of Table 35 is&#13;
derived from Table 34 by subtracting the labor returns estimated by Alton from&#13;
the net domestic product based on the official figures. It indicates non-&#13;
labor returns implied in the official estimates. In the second column these&#13;
returns have been divided by the Alton Group's estimates of capital and land&#13;
values for each sector and is the implied rate of return. Negative returns&#13;
are suggested in both agriculture and "housing, communal and other"&#13;
services. Probably returns in agriculture were very low, but not negative as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
suggested by Alton's overstatement of labor's share (large losses in animal&#13;
production may have been compensated by profits on crops). On the other hand,&#13;
returns to capital in housing appear to be negative. This results from the&#13;
official imputation of very low rents to all housing and is probably a real&#13;
bias, given that housing purchases have been forced on households by the state&#13;
in numerous instances. Finally, in column (5) of Table 35 the deviations from&#13;
a condition of constant average returns to capital and land are calculated as&#13;
a percentage of official net domestic product in each sector. The percentages&#13;
suggest the extent of deviations of actual Romanian prices from an ideal&#13;
pricing system based on factor costs and an equal average return on non-labor&#13;
factors across all sectors.&#13;
D. Problems in the Evaluation of National Income from Foreign Trade&#13;
The estimates of Romania' s net exports in Table 25 do not include net&#13;
exports of factor services, in Romania's case mostly interest payments. The&#13;
values as indicated by information on Romania's external balances in Table 36&#13;
have been negative. Both the production and the uses or expenditure sides of&#13;
GDP should be reduced. In 1980 the amounts in the external balance and&#13;
foreign prices were 788-959 million US dollars, or not more than 1-2 billion&#13;
domestic lei. This is a relatively insignificant correction.&#13;
A second problem arises from Romania's use of what Thomas Wolf has&#13;
called the "Soviet" approach to the evaluation of gross production in trade.&#13;
A reformulated version of these amounts would be as follows: 1/&#13;
1/ For a Romanian version, see D. Sandru, "Influenta preturilor interne si&#13;
externe asupra calculului produsului global si produsului net din comertul&#13;
exterior", an article published in a collection of papers by the Romanian&#13;
CSO, Studii de statistica (Bucharest, 1972), pp. 1567-1572.&#13;

F    F   I        EF         F    F&#13;
The first term in (A) above is the value of the decline or increase in&#13;
currency balances in conventional internal prices and the second term is the&#13;
value of the decline or increase in foreign currency balances in foreign&#13;
prices where&#13;
ID              = imports in domestic prices,&#13;
IF              = imports in foreign prices,&#13;
ED              = exports in domestic prices,&#13;
EF              = exports in foreign prices&#13;
Item (3) above. or the whole expression, (A), is a source of bias&#13;
which, according to Wolf, can be estimated using the foreign trade balance in&#13;
foreign prices and information in Table 37. Ideally the calculation ought to&#13;
be based on all trade, but the requisite data are lacking. Instead, Table 37&#13;
is based on convertible currency trade only. According to Wolf, if there has&#13;
been a negative foreign trade balance, the bias is estimated by multiplying&#13;
the balance by one minus the figures under the import column of the Table&#13;
37. The results in Romania's case are as follows:&#13;

Another problem in this area is that in the SNA methodology the&#13;
balance of indirect taxes minus subsidies includes those on foreign trade. In&#13;
a market economy with flexible domestic prices, foreign and domestic prices of&#13;
traded goods tend to move proportionately, linked by ad valorem taxes and&#13;
subsidies. However, in centrally planned economies these proportions tend not&#13;
to be maintained because of the greater use of inflexible domestic prices.&#13;
Hence, the balance of taxes minus subsidies in foreign trade can be large and&#13;
also subject to rather abrupt fluctuations. In this regard, notice can be&#13;
taken of the relatively large fluctuations in the trade sector's share of&#13;
Romania's NMP, as shown in Table 1. Possibly this ought to be seen as a bias&#13;
in the national accounts.&#13;
E. Adjusting for Enterprise Expenses on Cultural Facilities and Business&#13;
Travel Expenses of Employees&#13;
The standard conversion from MPS to SNA calls for deductions of (1)&#13;
material expenditures by enterprises on cultural and similar facilities for&#13;
employees and (2) material goods and services purchased during business&#13;
trips. In Romania's case, it should be noted again that passenger&#13;
transportation, hotels and restaurants are included in material production.&#13;
Hence, items under (2) will have been counted in NMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
No information has been found on these items for Romania and no&#13;
adjustments made. Probably they would each amount to no more than one percent&#13;
of NMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. PROBLEMS IN THE ESTIMATION OF GDP GROWTH RATES&#13;
The problems of evaluating the official growth rates of Romania's NMP&#13;
have already been discussed in Part II of the paper. It is the opinion of the&#13;
author that the official growth of NMP produced is biased upward and that&#13;
further upward biases may be involved in the official scaling up of NMP to&#13;
GDP. In addition there is a lack of publication of details on NMP and GDP in&#13;
constant and current prices which adds considerable uncertainty to any&#13;
Romanian data.&#13;
A. Lack of Information&#13;
Official indices for total NMP and NMP produced in most sectors are&#13;
published in highly rounded-off figures going back to 1950. However, no&#13;
official data for years before 1975 is available to match those in Tables 2,&#13;
3, 5 and 6. Additional relevant information, part from unofficial sources, is&#13;
set out in Table 38.&#13;
B. Upward Biases of Early-Year Weights&#13;
Table 38 attempts to identify basic information about the&#13;
construction of official Romanian indices of net material product. These&#13;
indices incorporate at least three different methodologies for assigning the&#13;
current values of output to sectors. They are designated A, B and C in Table&#13;
38. 1/ Five sets of price weights have also been applied: 1950 prices for&#13;
1950-59, 1955 prices for 1959-65, 1963 prices for 1965-75, 1977 prices for&#13;
1/   The shift from A to B involved, among other changes, assigning the values&#13;
of passenger transportation, communications for persons, and tourist&#13;
services to respective NMP sectors. They formerly were not considered&#13;
part of material product. The change from B to C in 1975 has not yet&#13;
been described in the Romanian statistical yearbook.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
1975-80, and 1981 prices since 1980. 1/ It is important to understand that&#13;
changing price weights involve both (1) changing the relative size or share of&#13;
each sector and (2) changing!the size or weights of products within each&#13;
sector. The latter means that each sector's growth for a given period depends&#13;
on which set of price weights is used. For example, from 1950 to 1959 value-&#13;
added in industry grew to an index of 318 (1950=100) in prices of 1950, but to&#13;
an index of 262 (1950=100) in prices of 1955. Therefore, changing price&#13;
weights influenced the growth of total net material product in two ways: (1)&#13;
changing sector growth; and (2) changing the weight of sectors.&#13;
Generally the effects of changing price weights have been (1) to&#13;
reduce industry's share in NMP and increase agriculture's share, and (2) to&#13;
reduce industry's rate of growth and to increase that of agriculture. The&#13;
Romanian shift from 1950 to 1955 prices illustrates these characteristics.&#13;
The effects of shifting to 1963 prices and to 1977 prices are less certain&#13;
because, as the table shows, no data has been found for sector shares in 1963&#13;
constant prices in either method A or method B. Also, no other cases of&#13;
sectoral growth in two sets of prices has been found. However, the certainty&#13;
that this has happened may be easily illustrated by estimating sector shares&#13;
in 1975 based on shares in 1959 and growth for total NMP, industry and&#13;
agriculture from 1959 to 1975. If industry's share had not been reduced, its&#13;
constant price share in 1975 (in 1963 prices) would have been 79 percent.&#13;
1/   In the 1978 yearbook growth in 1976 was still measured in 1963 prices&#13;
while both 1976 and 1977 were still calculated according to methodology&#13;
B. (See Table 38.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Agriculture's share would have fallen to only 9.5 percent. At this rate,&#13;
industry would soon produce all national income and agriculture none. 1/&#13;
Another view of what has been applied in Romanian NMP growth is&#13;
presented in Table 39. Here, data from Table 38 are combined with estimates&#13;
of total NMP and value-added in industry and agriculture in order to estimate&#13;
implicit price deflators. First, one should notice that how much real growth&#13;
is attributed to NMP, industry or agriculture, is a matter of selection of&#13;
price weights. Using 1955 price indices for 1950-59 results in less NMP and&#13;
industrial growth and more agricultural growth than is shown by the official&#13;
indices. Second, as a result of using both sets of real indices, alternative&#13;
price deflators are estimated.&#13;
Differences in the two sets of implicit-price indices in 1963 and&#13;
later are entirely accounted for by differences in 1959, a result which&#13;
follows having alternative real growth indices for only 1950-59. So far, the&#13;
author has found no way to estimate price indices between 1963 and 1977.&#13;
The effects of changing from 1963 constant prices to 1977 constant&#13;
prices can be estimated. The value of gross industrial output for 1975 is&#13;
about 2.4 percent higher in 1977 prices than in 1963 prices. The value of&#13;
gross agricultural output is about 12.1 percent higher in 1977 prices than in&#13;
1963 prices. 2/&#13;
1/   Even more clearly absurd examples result if sector growth from 1950 to&#13;
1977 is applied to 1950 shares. By 1977, industry's share in 1977 NMP in&#13;
constant prices would rise to 103 percent, of course, impossible.&#13;
2/   Calculations are based on the 1977 plan fulfillment report (Scinteia,&#13;
5 February 1978) and data in the Romanian statistical yearbook.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
At the same time, the portion of industrial production representing&#13;
value-added was reduced and that for agriculture was increased as a result of&#13;
both the new price weights and the change from statistical methodology B to&#13;
C. Hence, agriculture's net product could have been 17.5 percent higher;&#13;
industry's could have turned out about 8.2 percent less. Hence, in the new&#13;
1977 prices, the weight of agriculture compared to industry in 1975 could have&#13;
been increased by about 29 percent compared to what it had been in the 1963&#13;
weights. 1/&#13;
The new "constant" price system of 1977, like its predecessors,&#13;
reduced the weight of the rapidly growing sector, industry, and increased the&#13;
weight of the more slowly growing sector, agriculture. Probably these shifts&#13;
recognize, in a large measure, changes in the relative current price&#13;
structure. Evidence suggests that industry current prices changed very little&#13;
at the branch wholesale level from 1965 to 1974. Prices paid to enterprises&#13;
were changed beginning in 1969 by the application of the so-called "regulating&#13;
tax" to reduce profit margins in cases where production costs had fallen&#13;
greatly with new technology and economies of scale. Branch wholesale prices&#13;
were changed from 1974 to 1976 in a general price reform preceding the&#13;
introduction of the new 1977 constant price system. During this time, prices&#13;
paid to peasants rose about 30 percent. If, between 1965 and 1977, prices&#13;
paid to peasants reflected the general movement of agricultural prices and&#13;
l/   The word "could" is used deliberately because gross industrial output and&#13;
gross agricultural output are not used directly in national product&#13;
computations. Turnover taxes are added to each sector's gross output to&#13;
derive "gross social product" in each sector. Because turnover taxes are&#13;
usually collected on industrial products, but not agricultural products,&#13;
a difference could arise in the national product shares.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
industry prices remained virtually constant, then relative current prices in&#13;
agriculture compared to industry would have increased 30 percent, about the&#13;
same as appears in 1963 and 1977 implicit price indices.&#13;
The difficulties discussed above are essentially related to the index&#13;
number problem. This problem becomes serious whenever a country's economic&#13;
structure changes rapidly on account of one sector growing faster than another&#13;
and, as a result, causing relative scarcities to change. A particular problem&#13;
with the Romanian case, however, is that so little explanation of the indices&#13;
is given in official publications. Inevitably, this will lead to confusion.&#13;
Generally, the early year price weights (1950 for 1950-59, 1955 for 1959-65,&#13;
1963 for 1965-75) are expected to give the NMP volume indices an upward bias.&#13;
C. The Volume of New Products and the Problem of Setting their Prices.&#13;
Table 7 indicates the relatively large turnover in product&#13;
nomenclature in recent years. This is combined with what appears to be a&#13;
relatively decentralized system of price setting (see Annex I). Some downward&#13;
bias on price indices and upward bias on growth indices must result.&#13;
D. Productivity and Price Changes for Services.&#13;
Unlike Hungary, the Romanian-CSO has said that it does not assume&#13;
productivity growth in services. However, just how real output is estimated&#13;
is unclear. There is insufficient information, as shown in Table 27, to&#13;
clearly indicate the implied prices of services in GDP. Evident price&#13;
increases took place in 1981. However, no other price increases are indicated&#13;
inasmuch as the service figures in 1979 and 1980 are the same for current and&#13;
constant-1977 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Services in the World Bank Staff Estimates of Growth&#13;
Table 40 sets out the GNP growth estimates of the World Bank Staff&#13;
from its recent study of Romania's economy. It is based on figures which&#13;
incorporate the official NMP growth and then adds estimates of services and&#13;
depreciation. More will be said about depreciation shortly.&#13;
The estimate of real services is a weighted average of the growth of&#13;
the occupied population and the capital stock in the non-material sectors.&#13;
Services grow faster than official NMP in this view. Hence, GNP also tends to&#13;
grow even faster than official NMP.&#13;
F. Problems in the Estimation of the Depreciation Accounts&#13;
The first published series on depreciation in Romania appeared in a&#13;
World Bank study of the country. The figures are shown in Table 31 and seem&#13;
to include only depreciation in the material sectors. The comparable data on&#13;
depreciation released for this study by the Romanian CSO reflect a lowering of&#13;
overall rates in 1977 from 5 percent to 4 percent of fixed capital assets.&#13;
Rates by sectors are given for only two years, 1979 and 1980, in Tables 22 and&#13;
23.&#13;
The depreciation amount for 1980 may be compared to capital stock&#13;
estimates derived from the Romanian statistical yearbook. The following&#13;
approximate rates of depreciation result:&#13;
Total                                  3.22%&#13;
(excluding roads and bridges)          3.78%&#13;
industry                               3.66%&#13;
construction                           5.85%&#13;
agriculture                            3.06%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
transportation and&#13;
communications                       3.70%&#13;
housing, communal&#13;
and other services                   1.76%&#13;
Probably these estimates are low because the capital stock figures&#13;
are biased upward. They represent an undepreciated capital stock series at&#13;
original cost, not replacement cost.&#13;
C. The Deflation of Net Exports and the Influence of Foreign&#13;
Trade Accounting on GDP Growth&#13;
As one might expect there is a difference in net exports in current&#13;
and constant prices, as shown below (in billion lei):&#13;
Current              Constant - 1977&#13;
Year             Prices                  Prices&#13;
1975             -3.7                     +0.3&#13;
1976             +0.6                     -3.6&#13;
1978             -8.9                     -5.2&#13;
1979             -8.2                     -2.0&#13;
1980            -12.3                     +7.7&#13;
The basis of the constant price figures is unknown.    There is also no&#13;
knowledge of the constant-price counterparts to biases dicussed above under&#13;
the estimation of national income from foreign trade.&#13;
H. Comparison of the Alton Group and Official Estimates of Growth&#13;
Tables 41 and 42 compare the growth of Romanian national product and&#13;
value-added in the main sectors according to official Romanian NMP and&#13;
estimates of GNP by Alton and his associates. Differences in methodology in&#13;
the two sets of data follow those discussed in papers by Alton elsewhere and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
need no repetition here, except to note that the growth rates in Tables 41 and&#13;
42 are based on the compound-interest formula, reflecting only the beginning&#13;
and end years of the several time periods.&#13;
There is little difference in the growth rate of agriculture in the&#13;
two sets of data. A noteworthy feature is that Alton estimates higher growth&#13;
for agriculture than is shown by the official figures. By contrast, Alton&#13;
shows much slower growth for industry. This combined with the smaller weight&#13;
given to industry explains most of the slower growth estimated for total&#13;
national product.&#13;
A final important remark needs to be made about the methodology used&#13;
by the Alton Group. Contrary to general opinion, a statistical series on&#13;
output in physical units need not necessarily be biased downward. It can also&#13;
be biased upward. This is because such indices are themselves aggregations&#13;
and incorporate product change. Allowances for both aggregation and product&#13;
change is done by using technical coefficients that are similar to constant&#13;
prices. For example, any given electrical motor will be assigned a&#13;
coefficient indicating how many "standard" electrical motors it represents.&#13;
Obviously, such a coefficient could have biases either way.&#13;
The only other alternative calculation of Romania's real growth is&#13;
one for per capita GDP based on the "physical indicator gross" (PIG) technique&#13;
employed by the UN Economic Commission for Europe. 1/ For the period, 1950 to&#13;
1973, Romania's growth rate (per capita GDP) was estimated at 5.9 percent per&#13;
year. The figure is much closer to that in the Alton studies, 4.8 percent,&#13;
1/ UN/ECE, Economic Bulletin for Europe, Vol. 31, No. 2 (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
than to the official figure of 8.5 percent per year. Thus, PIG techniques&#13;
would support the view tha\t the official figure is biased upward. 1/&#13;
1/ The pattern of deviations for sub-periods of the PIG study have not been&#13;
considered. They may give a different impression. Also, it is possible&#13;
that PIG is biased downward for the same reasons as the Alton figure, that&#13;
the indicators used in them do not cover the faster growing sectors of the&#13;
Romanian economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

V. EXCHANGE RATES AVAILABLE FOR ROMANIA&#13;
Romania's official exchange rates since 1970 are presented in Table&#13;
43. The valuta leu (plural lei) is only an accounting unit used through 1980&#13;
in the foreign trade statistics of the statistical yearbook. Its limited&#13;
importance is suggested by the fact that internal foreign trade documents are&#13;
normally recorded in US dollar, not valuta units. The non-commercial rate is&#13;
a real exchange rate for foreign tourists from non-CMEA countries and their&#13;
embassies. The internal coefficient, now officially the commercial exchange&#13;
rate, was established in 1970. The rate of 15 lei to the US dollar applied in&#13;
1981 was first announced by the government in 1978. It has been a real&#13;
exchange rate only in a restricted sense which needs a brief explanation.&#13;
Under the system established in 1970, export invoices were paid by&#13;
the Romanian Bank of Foreign Trade to the Romanian exporter at a value in&#13;
internal lei equal to the foreign price (say, in dollars) multiplied by the&#13;
internal coefficient for exports. The resulting value was only coincidentally&#13;
equal to the domestic Romanian price of the exported products. As noted&#13;
above, the domestic price of some exports were then being subjected to a&#13;
system of "calculated prices" to reduce their rate of profitability to 10-15&#13;
percent, while the surplus above this for similar items marketed domestically&#13;
were removed by the "regulating tax" (see above).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
That external prices of exports translated into internal lei by the&#13;
internal coefficient, now commercial exchange rate, was only coincidentally&#13;
equal to the internal price of exports is shown in Table 44. In 1975, for&#13;
example, the average unit of exports worth one dollar abroad had an internal&#13;
price of about 18.84 lei, not the 20 lei per dollar in the commercial exchange&#13;
rate. Looked at in another way, under this arrangement the $2,839 million of&#13;
Romanian exports for convertible currencies in 1975 would have brought&#13;
exporters 3,293 million lei more profits than if the same goods would have&#13;
been transferred at domestic prices (20.00 - 18.84 = 1.16; 1.16 x 2,839 =&#13;
3,293).&#13;
Such a circumstance, called a "favorable difference in export&#13;
prices", took place whenever the internal price of exports (made up from the&#13;
enterprise wholesale price plus special export costs, packaging and trans-&#13;
portation to the Romanian border) was less than the external price, franco-&#13;
frontiera romana, transformed into internal lei according to the prevailing&#13;
commercial exchange rate. In a like manner "unfavorable differences" in&#13;
export prices were defined when the internal price exceeded the external&#13;
price, both in lei. In the case of imports "favorable" and "unfavorable"&#13;
differences were defined when internal prices were, respectively, more and&#13;
less than external prices, both in lei.&#13;
In the Romanian system "favorable" and "unfavorable" differences in&#13;
prices were not all left with the export and import units. To have done so&#13;
would have left some enterprises extremely profitable and other with heavy&#13;
losses. Actually "differences" in prices were planned along with the volumes&#13;
and directions of exports and imports. As a consequence, the total volume of&#13;
"differences", both favorable and unfavorable, were planned as a part of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
state budget. They were paid, according to foreign trade and financial plans,&#13;
as effective taxes and subsidies in order to "equalize" the external prices in&#13;
lei conversion with the established internal prices. Under the system&#13;
initially established, only 5 percent of the differences, favorable and&#13;
unfavorable, were to have accrued to the export producers as incentives.&#13;
Table 21 contains estimates of the budget inflows and outflows resulting from&#13;
foreign trade in convertible currencies without an attribution of part of the&#13;
cost or benefit to foreign trade units.&#13;
Table 33 provides several possible exchange rates that might be used&#13;
to translate any estimate of Romania's GDP or GNP from domestic lei into US&#13;
dollars for international comparison. The first three rates are average&#13;
prevailing rates during each year of the official lei valuta rate, the non-&#13;
commercial or tourist rate, and the commercial rate, all as estimated in and&#13;
published by the IMF in International Financial Statistics. The next three&#13;
rates are the average realized rates or ratios between the domestic lei values&#13;
of exports and imports, and then their trade-weighted average as calculated by&#13;
the author of this paper. The next two rates, not given for recent years, are&#13;
estimates of the average rates of exchange in all exports and imports, assum-&#13;
ing a converison of rubles to dollars at official Romanian rates. The last&#13;
rate is an extension of the purchasing power parity for CDP between the lei&#13;
and the US dollar, as estimated by the ICP. That calculation resulted in a&#13;
figure of 8.8 lei per dollar. It has been projected forward using the ratio of&#13;
the implicit price deflator for Romanian NMP produced, shown in Table 10, to&#13;
one for the United States covering GNP. The result projects a very low rate&#13;
for 1980, almost equal to the official rate for the "valuta lei". Not&#13;
surprisingly, the ratio of this rate in 1981 to its 1975 value of about 66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
percent is close to the ratio of the average realized rate for total trade in&#13;
convertible currency in 1980 compared to 1975 of about 66 percent. It appears&#13;
to have lagged the former by one year. Both are obviously under the same two&#13;
influences, Romania's nearly fixed internal prices and the rising levels of&#13;
international prices. However, the movement in 1981 starts to reflect very&#13;
large internal price adjustments.&#13;
A different aspect of the relationship between purchasing power&#13;
parity ratios resulting from the ICP and Romania's price structure is explored&#13;
in Table 45. An attempt is made to match PPP from the ICP to PPP as indicated&#13;
by domestic-foreign price ratios of specific traded goods. The result is not&#13;
very successful, given the lack of sufficient aggregation on the ICP side and&#13;
the relatively few price ratios published by Romania.&#13;
There is a hint in the few comparable cases that PPP is higher in the&#13;
price ratios for traded commodities. This is indicated in the cases of meat,&#13;
clothing and footwear where the latter are at least twice the ICP figures.&#13;
This may suggest that foreign markets are discounting the quality of Romanian&#13;
products far more than appreciated in the ICP.&#13;
&#13;

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
There are numerous uncertainties in the estimates of CDP in current&#13;
domestic prices, as provided by the Romanian CSO. Some possible upward biases&#13;
and deletions are matched by possible downward biases and deletions. Two of&#13;
the larger ones, the failure to adequately deduct for intermediate products in&#13;
some services and the understatement of housing services, do tend to offset&#13;
one another. The official values of NMP may have a + 5-6 percent error&#13;
associated with them. The GDP figures surely have a wider margin of error,&#13;
possibly as great as + 10-12 percent. Much could be done by the Romanian CSO&#13;
to reduce these factors simply by publishing more details and more&#13;
explanations.&#13;
Official growth rates are biased upward, especially considering the&#13;
obvious index number problems when estimates are projected backwards. Tables&#13;
38 and 39 suggest the bias from using early-year price weights alone. Again&#13;
the CSO could reduce the uncertainty of estimates by publishing estimates for&#13;
the period 1959 to 1975 in mid-year or late-year price weights.&#13;
Beyond this, estimation of the biases is difficult. Some use of the&#13;
Alton Group figures as the possible offset to the official data is&#13;
recommended, at least until the Romanian CSO explains more about its own&#13;
methods for industry. The best guess of growth could be the geometric mean of&#13;
Alton and official data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Conversion of the GDP figures from lei to US dollars also pose a wide&#13;
range of possibilities, as shown by the following figures for 1980 (in 1980&#13;
dollars): 1/&#13;
The official commercial rate (18 lei/$) - $1,551 per capita&#13;
The average realized rate (12.16 lei/$) - $2,296     "      o&#13;
The projected ICP-PPP (6.3 lei/$)         - $4,432   "     o&#13;
The projected ICP-PPP times 1.4 (8.82 lei/$) = $3,166 per capita&#13;
The Romanian government, as do those of Hungary and Poland, favors&#13;
using the official commercial rate. In 1981, as seen in Table 44, this would&#13;
reduce Romania's GDP per capita below that calculated using the average&#13;
realized rate (ratio of domestic to foreign prices ex post) on traded&#13;
products. However, it is the latter rate that may be the best test of the&#13;
relative quality and productivity of Romania's products and labor.&#13;
1/ Past official Romanian estimates of the dollar value of their national&#13;
product have been as follows. In 1979 the per capita national product&#13;
projected for 1990 was $3,000-3,500 or 47,000-50,000 lei. Then, it may be&#13;
noted, that by 1990, the Romanians expected a "commercial" exchange rate&#13;
of about 15 lei per dollar. By using the projections of population and&#13;
growth of national product, which were made at the same time, a range of&#13;
the implicit net material product in 1975 and 1980 can be derived as $991-&#13;
1,105 in 1975 and $1,546-1,724 in 1980. The assumed "commercial" exchange&#13;
rate, calculated on the basis of published and estimated national product&#13;
figures in lei, turns out to be about 16 lei per dollar for 1975. Working&#13;
with similar projections made in 1974, the implied 1975 national product&#13;
per capita turns out to be $838-929, with an exchange rate of about 19 lei&#13;
per dollar.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX I. RELATIVE PRICES, THEIR RECENT MOVEMENTS AND CONTENTS&#13;
The quantitative evidence on Romanian prices remains even more&#13;
difficult to obtain than that for the national product accounts. Aside from&#13;
the implicit prices indices calculated by the author from the NMP figures in&#13;
current and constant price (see Table 10) no other quantitative dimensions of&#13;
prices were released for this study.&#13;
A. The Relative Price Structure&#13;
In another study of Romania, the author has calculated the relative&#13;
output per person occupied in agriculture compared to industry, across all the&#13;
countries of CMEA. This was done by dividing the share of NMP produced in&#13;
current prices by the share of labor in the material sectors for both&#13;
agriculture and industry. Then the result for agriculture was divided by that&#13;
for industry. The ratio for Romania turned out to be the lowest of countries&#13;
in the group. This suggests that the real output per person occupied in&#13;
Romanian agriculture compared to the real output per person occupied in&#13;
Romanian industry has been unusually low (possibly the result of capital per&#13;
labor, the qualities of labor, and other factors, including even the way of&#13;
counting persons occupied or that Romanian producer prices in agriculture&#13;
compared to industry were low, or some combination of both factors. 1/ It is&#13;
only with the recent releases of statistics that enough evidence is available&#13;
1/ According to one Romanian economist, the value of material expenditures&#13;
alone for animal products exceeded the gross output value of animal&#13;
products by 157 million lei annually in the period 1976-1978.    An&#13;
attribution of labor cost of work by cooperators would have pushed annual&#13;
losses to about 3.2 billion lei. 0. Parpala, Economia si politica agrara&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

to measure the relative sources in Romania's case, but time has not permitted&#13;
the work to be done. 1/&#13;
A different kind of evidence has been the result of the ICP, part of&#13;
which was prepared as a special study by Professor Heston and is presented in&#13;
Table 8. The numbers in the table compare the relative structures of final-&#13;
expenditure prices in Hungary, Poland and Romania against the average for a&#13;
reference group of countries in the same income-level categories. The&#13;
relative-price level of food products in the table reflects retail prices, not&#13;
those paid to farmers. Another point to keep in mind is that the data are for&#13;
1975, a point in time when Romania was just about to embark on a long-overdue&#13;
realignment of prices.&#13;
Professor Heston's summary observations about Romania may be noted&#13;
and then evidence considered which might reflect changes since 1975. He noted&#13;
(a) Romania's relatively high prices for household furnishing and appliances&#13;
and for its tariffs for transportation and communications, (b) the greater&#13;
variation than in the other countries in its overall price structure for&#13;
consumption, (c) in the case of investment, its unusually low prices for&#13;
construction and "much higher" prices for producers durables, and (d) its&#13;
relatively high prices for commodities and low prices for services and&#13;
construction. Finally, with respect to Table 8 of this paper, he observed&#13;
that Romanian prices were less similar to all other countries than were the&#13;
prices of Hungary, Poland, or Yugoslavia.&#13;
1/ See Marvin R. Jackson, "Bulgaria's Economy in the 1970s: Adjusting&#13;
Productivity to Structure," in East European Economic Assessment Part I -&#13;
Country Studies, 1980, a compendium of papers submitted to the Joint&#13;
Economic Committee, Congress of the United States. Washington, D.C.,&#13;
1981, P. 575.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
That Romania's commodity prices were relatively high may confirm a&#13;
price structure favoring industry over construction and services (not&#13;
including passenger transportation and public communications), but it&#13;
indicates less about industry compared to agriculture. The higher variability&#13;
of prices and their lack of similarity to other country structures may reflect&#13;
the outmoded character of a basic price structure dating from 1963, although&#13;
annual production losses were still experienced in agriculture after later&#13;
price adjustments in 1977.&#13;
Another possible evidence of Romania's relative price structure&#13;
compared internationally may be taken as the pattern of average implicit&#13;
exchange rates for exports in convertible currencies, the ratios of internal&#13;
to external prices, as published recently in the Economic Memorandum (see&#13;
Table 45 for examples). They show only three agricultural commodities, hardly&#13;
a representative sample. The ratio for meat prices is above the average for&#13;
all CC exports while the one for wheat starts far below the overall average in&#13;
1975 and reaches it in 1977. Figures on edible oil are not given until 1978&#13;
and are then slightly below average. Of the larger number of industrial&#13;
commodities in the list, about half are below the overall average and about&#13;
half above. A qualification of this evidence is that it remains unclear if&#13;
special price concessions on exports might have been continued past the first&#13;
part of the 1970s when they were a part of the price system (see below).&#13;
B. Movements of Prices Since 1975&#13;
Table 9 reproduces Romania's retail price indices (excluding sales in&#13;
the peasant market), which continue to be the only officially published price&#13;
indices for the country. Others, such as a wage deflator and those shown in&#13;
Tables 10 and 17, can be calculated. If international prices were to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
assumed unchanged (of course they are not) then the relative changes of retail&#13;
prices in Table 9 would be such as to make Romania's relative price structure&#13;
in Table 8 more similar to that of other countries.&#13;
Table 10 supplies the movement of calculated, implicit-price&#13;
deflators for the NMP components, both production and expenditures. One might&#13;
assume that the sharp rise in construction prices in 1977 combined with the&#13;
small reduction in industrial prices would have modified Professor Heston's&#13;
conclusions (other evidence to this same effect is found in Tables 17 and&#13;
18). At the same time there would have been little room for any similar&#13;
change in the high relative prices of transportation. The relative movements&#13;
of agricultural and industrial prices from 1980 forward would tend to remove&#13;
any relative deficit of the former in earlier years. Finally, in the case of&#13;
prices shown for NMP used there has been little room for any downward shift in&#13;
relative investment prices compared to relative consumption prices.&#13;
C. The Cost Content of Romanian Prices&#13;
One major issue in recent Romanian price changes, especially the&#13;
general realignment of 1977, was the cost content and relative amounts of&#13;
accumulation or non-wage value-added to include in prices.     Besides this&#13;
attempt to have some kind of reasoned relationship between domestic costs and&#13;
prices, there has been even greater concern in the changes since 1980 to move&#13;
the relative price structure toward the world structure in order to provide&#13;
more effective information to planners if not also to managers, and better&#13;
incentives to the latter under the NEM evoked since 1978. Before discussing&#13;
the specific changes in the 1977 price system a series of data in Tables 11&#13;
through 16, suggesting some dimensions of cost and profit content, will be&#13;
reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
There are no official data published in Romania's statistical&#13;
yearbook on the cost accounts in agriculture other than figures showing the&#13;
division of gross output into its two main components, material expenditures&#13;
and NMP produced in agriculture. It is known that in 1976-78 prices for&#13;
animal products did not even fully cover material expenditures for them. The&#13;
shares of material expenditures are not shown for the three major organiza-&#13;
tional units (state units, cooperatives and personal/private farms), but it is&#13;
known their structures differ markedly. Table 11 presents some now dated&#13;
information from secondary sources. The information might be up-dated from&#13;
secondary sources, but it would be much easier if the statistical authorities&#13;
would release these data in normal publications. Table 11 will go without&#13;
further comment except to note that one item, not clearly shown as a cost of&#13;
agricultural cooperatives in Part A of the table, is shown in Part B. This is&#13;
the relatively large payments made for the services of agricultural&#13;
mechanization stations whose work is primarily for the cooperatives. It may&#13;
be that in Part A the two units are combined.&#13;
The remaining tables refer to the cost structure of republican&#13;
industry, details of which are published regularly in the statistical yearbook&#13;
and shown in Tables 13, 14, and 15. However, Table 12 presents information&#13;
not found in the yearbook on the percentages of accumulation, including&#13;
,turnover and other taxes. The gross profit margins include depreciation and&#13;
show a common upward trend in the shares of accumulation which is to be&#13;
expected in a system of nearly fixed prices where enterprises are increasing&#13;
in size and specialization. The variation in accumulation rates across&#13;
branches of industry does not appear large. The Ministry of Electrical Energy&#13;
has had high rates reaching about 50 percent of gross accumulation in 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Surprisingly, profit rates by 1975 for the Ministry of Light Industry do not&#13;
seem low compared to those in chemicals, machinery and metallurgy.&#13;
A further observation of profit rates is found in Table 16, Part B.&#13;
Here the numbers reflect the price realignments of 1977 and then 1981. The&#13;
profit mark-up in industrial prices of 1980 is nearly the same as that for&#13;
1975 in Table 12. The lower rate in 1981 would be expected immediately after&#13;
a price reform. During interviews in 1982, a Romanian authority on prices&#13;
indicated that profits as a percent of cost were then expected to be about 6-8&#13;
percent in extractive industries, 10-11 percent in energy and 25-30 percent in&#13;
the manufacture of consumer goods and machinery.&#13;
Tables 13, 14 and 15 show cost shares without profit. One noteworthy&#13;
feature of Table 13 is the downward tendency in the share of depreciation in&#13;
cost of production. In 1977 the drop in the average rate of depreciation&#13;
mirrored a nominal lowering of depreciation charges in the new system of&#13;
prices.&#13;
The patterns of cost-shares across branches of industry for 1975 and&#13;
1980, shown in Tables 14 and 15, reflect, more than anything, relative factor&#13;
intensities and the underlying technologies of production.&#13;
From the time trends suggested in Table 16 one would expect Romanian&#13;
industry in the future to experience smaller decreases in cost per unit of&#13;
output (measured in comparable price conditions). The achievements of 1976-80&#13;
were only about 70 percent of the decreases in the preceding two five-year&#13;
periods. The one year, 1981, saw only about 60-65 percent of the average for&#13;
1976-80. But with annual price changes now the rule, decreasing costs&#13;
calculated by comparable prices will have less meaning for the country's&#13;
actual price structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
D. The Price Re-Alignment of 1977&#13;
The main dimensions of a new price system to replace the one&#13;
established in 1963-65 were set out in a law on prices of 1971. The&#13;
restructuring of prices began in 1972 with changes in prices of raw material,&#13;
continued in 1973 with changes in prices of machine-building products, and&#13;
then with general corrections in 1976. However, a part of the reform actually&#13;
began in 1970 with the introduction of a "regularization tax" (see Table&#13;
19). This tax, considered as a tax on goods like the turnover tax, was&#13;
introduced as an adjunct to a system of "calculated prices" used for selected&#13;
exports and which limited profitability (profits as a percent of cost) to 10-&#13;
15 percent. The regularization tax was applied when the same commodities were&#13;
both exported and used internally in order to avoid any disincentive to export&#13;
(see the brief discussion under exchange rates, below). The need for this&#13;
tax, as shown in Table 19, was eliminated with the realignment of industrial&#13;
prices in 1976.&#13;
In addition to price changes influencing profits, there was also&#13;
introduced the principle in the new system that net income of enterprises&#13;
ought to be proportional to the value of productive funds, so called "prices&#13;
of production" (preturi de productie), rather than having it proportional to&#13;
costs as in the price system of 1963. 1/ Toward this end were introduced in&#13;
1/ See the discussion in Sica, op. cit., pp. 156-161. That the principle may&#13;
have not been widely known or applied is suggested by the fact that during&#13;
discussion with Romanian authorities in 1982 profits were still seen&#13;
mostly in terms of a mark-up on cost, not a rate of return on invested&#13;
capital. Also, Table 35 gives strong evidence that there are very large&#13;
differences across sectors in the implied rate of return on capital and&#13;
land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
1974 taxes on invested funds and on land (see Table 19), both of which were&#13;
considered as part of cost. Subsequent effects of the tax on the use of funds&#13;
and price structures were considered unsatisfactory. It was eliminated in&#13;
1977. The tax on land was kept, but shifted to a payment from profit not a&#13;
cost. At the same time there was introduced a tax on profit in 1977 and in&#13;
1979 following the basic laws setting up the NEM, a "levy" on the value of net&#13;
production. 1/ As can be seen from Table 19, these taxes and other&#13;
remittances of profits have reduced the role of the turnover tax on goods, the&#13;
chief indirect tax, in the budgetary system.&#13;
The only available indicators of the more detailed shifts in prices&#13;
introduced in-1977 and 1981 are the comparisons in Tables 17 and 18. Note&#13;
that these tables concern constant, not current prices (as in Table 10).&#13;
Table 17 is based on the several categories of absolute values of investment&#13;
expenditures in the Romanian economy and shows the result of dividing the&#13;
values in 1977 prices by those in 1963 prices, or those in 1981 by 1977.&#13;
There is evident a sharp rise in the prices of construction, already dis-&#13;
cussed. This same shift is probably responsible for the larger increases in&#13;
the price of investments in housing and trade, much of which takes the form of&#13;
construction work.&#13;
Table 18 is based on data in shares rather than absolute values;&#13;
hence, it shows only relative price changes within industry and agriculture.&#13;
1/ The tax on profits was due from all state industrial enterprises having an&#13;
average planned profitability (percentage of costs) over 15 percent with&#13;
marginal rates rising from 3 percent on profitability of 15.1 - 17&#13;
percent, eventually to 100 percent of profitability over 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
For example, the price change in heat and power was only 74.1 percent of the&#13;
average change in industrial prices. In the case of agriculture the prices of&#13;
animal products were raised slightly compared to crop prices. The table&#13;
becomes more meaningful with the help of some information supplied to the&#13;
author in 1982. Then Romanian authorities indicated the following approximate&#13;
shifts in levels of prices of 1977 compared to those of 1963:&#13;
industry                  12 percent&#13;
construction              12 percent&#13;
-            agriculture               almost no change&#13;
-            transportation            about 10 percent&#13;
With this information one may conclude that any branch with a&#13;
relative price change of 88 percent or less actually had its prices decreased&#13;
in 1977 on the "constant" price scale. This happened in the cases of (1) heat&#13;
and power, (2) electrical engineering, (3) chemicals and (4) clothing.&#13;
E. Indirect Taxes, Subsidies and Factor Costs in Romanian Prices&#13;
If information on distribution of NMP among principal social units by&#13;
production sectors were available, it would be possible to compare the&#13;
''primary incomes of enterprises" with the values of working and fixed capital&#13;
and of land used by each branch of the economy. The resulting rates of return&#13;
would reflect "market prices." In addition, if information on indirect taxes&#13;
and subsidies for different production sectors were available, the evaluations&#13;
could then be shifted from "market prices" to "factor costs".&#13;
In as much as the Romanian CSO did not furnish the relevant&#13;
information, only a limited exercise in factor cost evaluation could be made&#13;
for this project. It relied on estimates of values of capital and land, and&#13;
of payments to labor (similar to "primary incomes of the population") by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Alton Group. The results are presented in Table 35 and are discussed in&#13;
Section II, Part C.&#13;
The estimates in Table 35 could be refined by a more detailed&#13;
evaluation of payments to labor. At present the relatively poor quality of&#13;
the official Romanian estimates of capital stock would not merit the effort.&#13;
What is needed first is an inventory and re-evaluation of Romanian capital&#13;
stocks in current replacement costs. Such a project would be worthy of World&#13;
Bank support.&#13;
Data released on turnover taxes by the CSO in Table 20 are&#13;
insufficient for the adjustment from "market prices" to ''factor costs."     The&#13;
pattern of incidence in them is no surprise. 1/ It confirms that most&#13;
turnover taxes are levied on industrial products. But, as already noted in&#13;
the discussion of Table 19, this form of indirect taxes is rapidly diminishing&#13;
in importance in the Romanian system. In 1977 turnover taxes were only about&#13;
19 percent of the non-labor returns in Romanian industry. The tax on profit,&#13;
a direct tax introduced in 1977, began to replace turnover taxes as budget&#13;
income. The levy on net production, introduced in 1979, resembles a value-&#13;
added tax, not a profit tax, and raises the question of how it ought to be&#13;
treated in national accounting.&#13;
Some limited and poorly explained information on the values of&#13;
subsidies paid from the Romanian state budget are found in Table 21. Most of&#13;
their rather large sums in 1980 were connected with the practice of pricing&#13;
1/ As noted in Table 20, it includes a small amount of taxes on petroleum&#13;
products that are not included in the sums published in the Statistical&#13;
Yearbook data shown in Table 19.&#13;

imported petroleum at very low levels which was supposed to disappear in 1981&#13;
with scheduled internal price and exchange rate reforms.&#13;
The second part of Table 21 contains crude estimates of subsidies&#13;
(and taxes, as in 1974) resulting from the operations of the foreign trade&#13;
price equalization fund. There it is assumed that foreign exchange is "dis-&#13;
counted" or effectively bought and sold for trade operations in convertible&#13;
currencies at the so-called "commercial" exchange rates, shown in Table 32.&#13;

            National accounts and the estimation of
            gross domestic product and its growth rates for Romania
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper reviews the official
            estimates of Romania's net material product (NMP) and
            gross domestic product (GDP) and the underlying methods. It
            also reviews the data on growth rates of NMP and GDP. The
            paper identified possible sources for biases in the
            estimates of levels of NMP or GDP in the agricultural,
            services and foreign trade sectors and also of the growth
            rates of overall NMP and GDP. It then considers a few
            alternative exchange rates to convert the national currency
            GDP into US dollars and shows resulting per capita GDP
            numbers in US dollars.
