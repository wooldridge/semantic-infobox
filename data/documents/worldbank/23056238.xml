1.2.  The Contributions will be administered in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies&#13;
and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption.&#13;
1.3.  Recognizing the obligations of the Donors under various United Nations Security&#13;
Council Resolutions to take measures to prevent financing of terrorists, the Bank will undertake&#13;
reasonable efforts, consistent with the IBRD and IDA's Articles of Agreement and policies,&#13;
including those pertaining to combating financing for terrorists, to ensure that the Contributions&#13;
are used for their intended purposes and are not diverted to terrorists or their agents. The Bank&#13;
will further include a provision in each grant agreement to be entered between the Bank and&#13;
eligible recipients that each such recipient: (i) will not use the proceeds of the on-granted&#13;
Contributions for the purpose of any payment to persons or entities, of for the import of goods, if&#13;
such payment or import, to the recipient's knowledge or belief, is prohibited by a decision of the&#13;
United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,&#13;
including under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 and related resolutions; and&#13;
(ii) will include a corresponding provision in any sub-grant agreements that the eligible recipient&#13;
enters into with entities to which the recipient makes the grant funding available. The Donors&#13;
acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-&#13;
terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to the Donors, nor will it be deemed a waiver, express or implied,&#13;
of any of the privileges and immunities of the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
2.     Commingling, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
2.1.   The Contributions will be accounted for as a single trust fund and will be kept separate&#13;

facilitate their disbursement.&#13;
2.3.   The Bank will invest and reinvest the Contributions pending their disbursement in&#13;

and one half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Contributions. If the Contributions increase beyond&#13;
what was originally expected at the time of counter-signature of the first administration&#13;
agreements, and the administrative costs increase as a result, the Donors acknowledge that an&#13;
additional administrative fee may be applied to such new contributions.&#13;
4.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
4.1.   The Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into&#13;

Arrangement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant&#13;
Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors&#13;

Grant Agreements (other than those executed by a UN-FPA Signatory). Subject to the consent of&#13;
the relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be invited by the Bank to participate in&#13;
Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
4.3.   The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms of&#13;
any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any&#13;
Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the Donors the opportunity to&#13;
exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
Modifications to the terms of any Grant Agreement or similar documents entered with a UN-FPA&#13;

6.2.   The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in United States Dollars of the Trust Fund with respect to the&#13;
Contributions via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6)&#13;

Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and&#13;

Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report, comprising (1) a management assertion together&#13;
with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (2) a combined&#13;
financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's&#13;
opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the Bank.&#13;
6.4.   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will decide on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following the decision on the scope and&#13;
terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit,&#13;
including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, will be paid by the requesting&#13;
Donor.&#13;
6.5.   The Bank will provide the Donors with copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;
