&amp;#12;ABSTRACT&#13;
     Between 1997-2008, the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Flagship Program on Health Sector Reform and&#13;
&#13;
     Sustainable Financingâ&#128;&#157; delivered 319 short-term training events to more than 19,400 policy-makers,&#13;
&#13;
     analysts and implementers in 51 Bank client countries. Resource persons from more than 34 technical&#13;
&#13;
     and implementation partners from around the world have collaborated to develop and deliver learning&#13;
&#13;
     materials, approximately half located in developed countries and half in developing countries. This&#13;
&#13;
     paper reflects on the design, implementation, impact, and lessons learned from the â&#128;&#156;Flagship Program,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
     widely regarded as the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s most successful and longstanding capacity-building&#13;
&#13;
     initiative in health in developing countries. Such a review is timely given current calls for Health&#13;

I&#13;
          n 1995, several bi-lateral donors requested the World Bank                        sector reform or that â&#128;&#156;one size fits all.â&#128;&#157; Nor would any kind of&#13;
          Institute (WBI) to develop a training and capacity-building                       World Bank blueprint or agenda for reform be advocated.&#13;
          program for low and middle income countries to address a                          Rather, the importance of national values, culture, politics, and&#13;
          burgeoning interest in health sector and financing                                history, and the pros and cons of different country approaches&#13;

ent options for improving performance, (iii) foster a more evidence                         view of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s comparative advantage in these areas.&#13;
based approach to implementing change, and (iv) contribute to                         I     Impact of training and capacity building would be evaluated&#13;
regional and national level capacity building in the area of training                       using participant satisfaction ratings, cognitive testing as well as&#13;
and information services. WBI responded by launching an ambi-                               various forms of follow-up to assess usefulness at the country&#13;

    Development of the Programâ&#128;&#153;s learning platform was guided by                           sector reform and sustainable financing to developing countries;&#13;
yearlong consultations with donors, government officials, and&#13;

  FLAGSHIP REGIONAL PARTNER INSTITUTES&#13;
In Lebanon, a partnership was formed with the Faculty of Health&#13;
Sciences at the American University of Beirut. Serving as a region-&#13;
al partner institute since 1999, AUB has delivered 12 regional&#13;
Flagship courses to 457 leading health professionals from countries&#13;
of the Middle East and Northern Africa and collaborated on the&#13;
delivery of 16 national courses in Iran and Egypt, reaching about&#13;
685 Iranian and Egyptian health professionals.&#13;

In China, a partnership was formed with the â&#128;&#156;China Network for&#13;
Training and Research in Health Economics and Financeâ&#128;&#157; that, today,&#13;
comprises 29 network-affiliated Chinese universities, research insti-&#13;
tutes, and professional journals. As a Flagship regional partner insti-&#13;
tute since 1999, the China Network has delivered 34 national Flagship&#13;
courses to almost 2500 health decision makers and executives. Due to&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population size and language, China was granted per-&#13;
mission by WBI to operate a full-fledged Flagship learning program&#13;
on a national level administered by the Ministry of Health.&#13;

In Iran, a partnership was formed with the Iranian Ministry of&#13;
Health and Medical Education and the American University of&#13;
Beirut to design and deliver seven, one-week courses over a nine&#13;
month period to a cohort of 50 senior managers and implementers&#13;
in 2004. This resulted in the translation and dissemination of train-&#13;
ing materials into Farsi to more than 2,000 health workers at&#13;
provincial and district levels. Follow-up courses were delivered in&#13;
2005 and 2007 to an additional 289 health officials.&#13;
    Similar arrangements have been launched in more then 15&#13;
countries, among which Bangladesh reaching 224 participants,&#13;
Egypt (335), India (361), Philippines (280), Turkey (617), and&#13;
Russia (202). In addition to establishing partnerships with nation-&#13;
al training institutes to design and deliver training programs, this&#13;
approach fostered strong collaboration between the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Operations and WBI in serving Bank client countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;EMPOWERING COUNTRY CLIENTS TO BETTER IMPLEMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS&#13;
To assess this dimension, feedback has been solicited from participants and country-level organizers on the value-added of Flagship training&#13;
in working environments. Three examples highlight the kinds of impact the training appears to be having in the area of implementation:&#13;

     A tracer study of 100 high level state and federal officials&#13;
     from India that had attended the annual Flagship Global&#13;
     courses from 1997-2006 was conducted in 2007.9 On a&#13;
     seven-point scale, eighty-three percent ranked their prior&#13;
     Flagship training as relevant and useful to their work (a&#13;
     score of â&#128;&#156;4â&#128;&#157; or more); none said the training was not rele-&#13;
     vant. In the words of one participant, â&#128;&#156;The discussions on&#13;
     financing strategies of health sector, experience-sharing of&#13;
     different countries and case studies are the three things I&#13;
     found most valuableâ&#128;¦ It gave me insight into the various&#13;
     options of financing, their pros and cons and their suitabili-&#13;
     ty to various work-environments. After this training, I vigor-&#13;

     I successfully changed the payment system to service&#13;
     providers from fixed salary system to salary plus perform-&#13;

     even after one year of leaving the department.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

further solicited feedback from World Bank â&#128;&#156;task team leadersâ&#128;&#157;&#13;

building that improves day-to-day collaboration with clients as&#13;
well as performance on the ground. Their views are invaluable&#13;
because they have extensive contacts in Bank client countries, they&#13;
help identify participants for Flagship training, and they have the&#13;
opportunity of observing both large scale and small-scale changes&#13;
in client countries. They too provide strong confirmation of the&#13;
positive effects of Flagship training, as exemplified in Annex 4.&#13;

                   mbitious in scope and determined to bring value-added to capacity building in Bank client countries, the Flagship Program has&#13;
                   devoted ten years to establishing â&#128;&#156;proof of conceptâ&#128;&#157; and demonstrating relevance. It embodies a vast repertoire of knowledge&#13;
                   not only on pedagogical issues and health reform challenges in developing countries, but on the process of institutional capacity&#13;
                   building as well. Nevertheless, the journey has not always been an easy one. Several hurdles continue to challenge the Program,&#13;
                   as detailed in Annex 6. KEY LESSONS LEARNED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING&#13;

  BACKGROUNDS. THIS REQUIRES A â&#128;&#156;BALANCING ACTâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
                                                                  While efforts to financially sustain the Flagship Program&#13;
  whereby faculty with strong theoretical orientations            have been successful in the pastâ&#128;&#148;through donor&#13;
  (e.g., principles of designing social health insurance) are     contributions, cost-cutting and user feesâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
  paired with resource persons with applied experience in         non-profit nature of the Program, combined with&#13;
  developing countries (eg., day-to-day management of             balanced budget cost-recovery, has yielded virtually&#13;
  social health insurance). It also requires selection and        no surplus.&#13;
  preparation of resource persons who are good at training&#13;
  and able to synchronize their contributions with the&#13;
  learning objectives of the Flagship learning framework.&#13;
  Neither of these requirements is easy to fulfill, and when&#13;
  not done adequately, participants complain loudly.&#13;

SIXTH,&#13;
  CLOSE WORKING RELATIONS AND PROXIMITY TO THE&#13;
  BANKâ&#128;&#153;S OPERATIONS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY VALUABLE&#13;
  IN IDENTIFYING POLICY MAKERS, MANAGERS AND&#13;
  ADMINISTRATORS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN NATIONAL&#13;
  HEALTH SYSTEMS WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO EFFECT&#13;
  CHANGE AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.&#13;
&#13;
  This has been greatly facilitated by World Bank â&#128;&#156;task&#13;
  team leadersâ&#128;&#157; who have nominated officials that would&#13;
  benefit from training, often taken the training them-&#13;
  selves, and subsequently worked alongside Flagship&#13;
  alumni in client countries. In addition, a strong&#13;
  connection to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Operations has helped apprise&#13;
  the Flagship Program of changing country needs and new&#13;
  reform efforts on the ground.&#13;

SEVENTH,&#13;
  AS IN ALL DEVELOPMENT WORK, MONITORING AND&#13;
  EVALUATION (M&amp;E) OF THE IMPACT OF FLAGSHIP&#13;
  TRAINING REQUIRES MORE ATTENTION AND MORE&#13;
  EARMARKED RESOURCES.&#13;
  Experience from the Program suggests that M&amp;E falls&#13;
  far short due to:&#13;
      corporate pressures to expand volume of training&#13;
  without satisfactorily ascertaining its value added,&#13;

&amp;#12;CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                HE FLAGSHIP PROGRAM WAS WBIâ&#128;&#153;S FIRST MAJOR LEARNING INITIATIVE THAT FEATURED AN IN-DEPTH&#13;
&#13;
      T         CORE COURSE, A NETWORK OF REGIONAL TRAINING PARTNERS IN EACH MAJOR GEOGRAPHICAL REGION,&#13;
                AND SUBSEQUENT ROLL-OUT OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES.&#13;
     The Programâ&#128;&#153;s capacity-building strategy has been successful in combining a variety of training instruments to support health&#13;
     system delivery in Bank client countries. Strong partnering arrangements have facilitated development of cutting-edge learning&#13;
     materials, adapting learning to regional and local needs, and responding to changing demands. It has a well-recognized â&#128;&#156;brand&#13;
     nameâ&#128;&#157; and few competitors. While the journey has not always been an easy one and important hurdles remain, the Program is&#13;
     well positioned to contribute to current priorities of health systems strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
     LOOKING AHEAD, SEVERAL ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO ENABLE THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAM TO SERVE BANK CLIENTS BETTER&#13;

&amp;#12;  ANNEX 1: ELEMENTS OF THE FLAGSHIP LEARNING FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T&#13;
               he Flagship learning framework begins by engaging            I   FINANCEâ&#128;&#148;resource mobilization, resource allocation, sus-&#13;
               participants in a discussion about ultimate as well as           tainability issues&#13;
               intermediate health system outcomes and what their           I   PAYMENTSâ&#128;&#148;financial incentives, such as supply side payments&#13;
               society is achieving and failing to achieve. Ultimate            to providers, demand side payments, pay for performance&#13;
outcomes are broadly classified into three categoriesâ&#128;&#148;improving             I   ORGANIZATIONâ&#128;&#148;the structure of health service delivery&#13;
health status, financial risk protection, and client satisfaction. Each         including the composition of the mix and interactions of the&#13;
of these ultimate outcomes has both a â&#128;&#156;levelâ&#128;&#157; (such as the popula-              organizations that produce inputs like human resources, and&#13;
tion average) and a â&#128;&#156;distributionâ&#128;&#157; (the disparities between groups).            the micro levels of within-organization functioning&#13;
It is through the notion of distribution that equity is introduced as       I   REGULATIONâ&#128;&#148;government regulation, self-regulation by&#13;
an ultimate outcome.11 Intermediate outcomes are also addressed                 financial or providers&#13;
under three broad categoriesâ&#128;&#148;efficiency, access and qualityâ&#128;&#148;each            I   PERSUASION AND BEHAVIOR CHANGEâ&#128;&#148;providers and&#13;
affecting the capacity of health systems to attain desired outcomes.            clients (households)&#13;
Focusing on the extent to which client countries are failing to                 Each â&#128;&#156;control knobâ&#128;&#157; is explored through presentations, country&#13;
achieve both ultimate and intermediate outcomes relative to their           case examples, and latest empirical evidence regarding various&#13;
own goals is defined as their â&#128;&#156;health system performance.â&#128;&#157;                  interventions. â&#128;&#156;Drill-downâ&#128;&#157; sessions typically devote one or two&#13;
     The next step probes the ethics underpinning the â&#128;&#156;the problem          days to illustrating how the control knobs apply to special topics,&#13;
statementâ&#128;&#157; to better understand the ethical foundations that differ-        such as â&#128;&#156;social health insurance,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;public private partnerships,â&#128;&#157; or&#13;
ent stakeholders (citizens, providers, politicians and bureaucrats,         â&#128;&#156;pharmaceuticals.â&#128;&#157; It is our perspective that the five control knobs,&#13;
drug manufacturers) may have in support of, or at odds with, the            though parsimonious, capture the main levers of reform. We have&#13;
importance given to these and other performance shortfalls or               yet to add an additional control knob.&#13;
health system problems. Ethical positions weigh heavily&#13;
on the kinds of problems stakeholders identify, the extent&#13;
                                                                        FIGURE 3:&#13;
to which they are serious about changing them, and the                  THE ROLE OF THE CONTROL KNOBS IN HEALTH SECTOR REFORM&#13;
kinds of ethical priorities they will enlist in support of&#13;
appropriate strategy. Likewise, the Flagship framework&#13;
stresses that â&#128;&#156;politics matters,â&#128;&#157; that tactics will be&#13;
required to mobilize different stakeholders to agree on&#13;
and tackle problems in a determined manner. To assist in&#13;
developing a political strategy, participants are intro-&#13;
duced to a planning software called â&#128;&#156;Policy Maker.â&#128;&#157;12&#13;
Attention to both ethics and politics is thus central to the&#13;
learning experience.&#13;
     Considerable energy is then devoted to applying a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;diagnostic treeâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;an analytic toolâ&#128;&#148;to understand&#13;
health system obstacles and bottlenecks that stand in the&#13;
way of solving the problems and attaining the desired&#13;
societal outcome (improved performance), for example,&#13;
reducing maternal mortality in rural areas. Participant&#13;
engagement is key here, made operative in the form of a&#13;
country group exercise whereby participants evolve a&#13;
country-specific strategy using real data and real con-&#13;
cerns to (i) identify and prioritize a problem, or an unat-&#13;
tained outcome, for action, (ii) justify selection of the&#13;
priority problem from an ethical standpoint, (iii) formu-&#13;
late a strategy to achieve the goal, and (iv) undertake a&#13;
political analysis to determine feasibility of success. The&#13;
country group work spans the entire duration of the&#13;
course with different clusters of participants each work-&#13;
ing on a selected country.&#13;
     Strategic intervention to produce change involves&#13;
action on five â&#128;&#156;control knobsâ&#128;&#157; or reform levers in the&#13;
Flagship framework. As depicted in Figure 3, these are:&#13;

EASTERN EUROPE&#13;
In 2008, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s manager of HNP activities in Europe observed:&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;Almost in every country I have visited, I have come in touch with people who are currently working on health who are alums of one of WBIâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
      Health Flagship Courses. I know this is impossible to quantify in a satisfying way for an econometrician, but it takes only one conversation per&#13;
      alum to see how this (training) is having an impact on policy development and implementation in these countries.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
CHUVASH AND VORONEZH REPUBLICS, RUSSIA&#13;
In 2008, the Bank task manager responsible for health activities in these republics observed:&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;As noted by the regional authorities, the courses improved the capacity of local staff as they allowed policy makers, administrators and&#13;
      service delivery personnel to get acquainted with and learn about concepts and methodologies that were useful for the design and&#13;
      implementation of strategic plans and activities for restructuring the regional health care delivery systemsâ&#128;¦. The capacity of Flagship&#13;
      partners that were involved in curriculum and materials development and training (eg., Russian Health Care Federation, Moscow Higher&#13;
      School of Economics, Chuvash Republic Ministry of Health, Vornonezh Oblast Department of Healthâ&#128;¦) was enhanced through learning by&#13;
      doing to play a more effective or influential role in leadership, training, and networking in the area of health policy, strategy, planning and&#13;
      implementation of institutional reforms.â&#128;¦ It is noteworthy that the experience and lessons learned during the implementation of the&#13;
      reforms in these two pilot regions were incorporated in the design of the ongoing Federal Government-funded â&#128;&#152;National Health Priority Pilot&#13;
      Projectâ&#128;&#153; in 19 regions of the Russian Federation.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
At the opening of the second Flagship course in the Philippines, Joachim von Amsberg, the Country Director for the Philippines,&#13;
commented that the delivery of the Flagship Program in the Philippines, is:&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;consistent with the World Bank commitment to support the countryâ&#128;&#153;s health reforms. It is serving as a â&#128;&#152;just-in-timeâ&#128;&#153; complementary&#13;
      capacity-building support activity to the World Bank funded National Sector Support for the Health Reform Project; building the capacity&#13;
      of key movers at the national, regional and local levels.â&#128;&#157; (The course was delivered 4 times in a series in the Philippines, covering all 16&#13;
      provinces where the national health reform plan, Fourmula One, has been rolled out, to which the Bank is one of the donor supporters.)&#13;

&amp;#12;INDIA&#13;
 In 2005, the Flagship Program began to collaborate with Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;National Institute of Health and Family Welfareâ&#128;&#157; (NIHFW) to provide crit-&#13;
ical training to state and district officers responsible for Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;National Rural Health Missionâ&#128;&#157; (NRHM). The NRHM involves a significant&#13;
scale-up of public funding for health and is a major new initiative to strengthen health systems in the country. Initial planning was facilitat-&#13;
ed by a â&#128;&#156;Situational Analysis of Existing Health Management Capacity Building in 2005, followed by training of 250 state and district level&#13;
officers, including many faculty members from Indian training institutes. The training has been targeted to officials from the states of Uttar&#13;
Paradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Jhakand, Uttarakhand and West Bengalâ&#128;&#148;all considered lagging in health systems performance.&#13;
&#13;
   In 2008, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Lead Economist for HNP13 in India observed:&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;&#156;The idea was to use the â&#128;&#156;India Flagship Programâ&#128;&#157; (NIHFW) as one vehicle for introducing new thinking and new knowledge and skills&#13;
          to take action. In each of the courses being offeredâ&#128;&#148;on â&#128;&#156;health systems policy and management,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;public-private partnerships in&#13;
          health,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;strengthening human resources,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;improving qualityâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;we are seeing people coming from both district and state level who&#13;
          are really eager to get new ideas and learn more about how to do things. This is really the only executive program the government is&#13;
          doing which is systematically introducing such training. Another thing worth mentioning is that the Minister of Health insisted very&#13;
          strongly that the India Flagship program be developed with significant India case material and Indian facultyâ&#128;&#148;not only outsiders.&#13;
          We have delivered on that and so one side effect is better dissemination within India of their own innovative experiences.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

  ANNEX 5: LEVERAGING WORLD BANK FINANCING FOR THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#148;as the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Learning Armâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;                    Program activities have been delivered to support this objective.&#13;

analysis of financing sources between 2003-05, reveals that WBI                 available from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Iran Health Project to support activities&#13;
learning programs in â&#128;&#156;health, nutrition, and populationâ&#128;&#157; (HNP)                  described previously in this paper. In Turkey, about $500 thousand&#13;
were able to leverage several millions of dollars from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s               was $500 made available from project funds for the design and&#13;
Operations Departments to support the development and delivery                  delivery of the Flagship Program in Turkey, largely to strengthen&#13;
of its country focused activities. More specifically, funds available           the countryâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;School of Public Healthâ&#128;&#157; (SPH). Capacity building&#13;

credits have been tapped to support the delivery of more than 25                faculty in the area of analyzing health sector reform, decentraliza-&#13;
national activities of direct benefit to client countries. Three modes          tion, and hospital reform which are aligned with the health sector&#13;
of financing from these sources can be illustrated as follows:                  reform process taking place in Turkey, (ii) further developing the&#13;
                                                                                capacity of the SPH to design and deliver such learning programs,&#13;

As noted previously, WBI and the Flagship Program have employed          Programâ&#128;&#153;s major partners to deliberate on questions such as: Would&#13;
several methods to monitor and evaluate the learning program over        termination of the Global course be a wise decision? Would region-&#13;

and time consuming. In the case of measuring cognitive learning          regional and national partners welcomed the learning materials,&#13;
gains, for example, procedures were extremely time consuming to          training guidelines, and access to resource persons associated with&#13;
manage and execute. Moreover, reliability was always threatened by       the progressively revised Global course. Second, the partners valued&#13;
the prospect that individual trainers would â&#128;&#156;teach to the questionsâ&#128;&#157;     the opportunity to send their own resource persons to the Global&#13;
towards boosting test scores and, thus, making the trainer appear        course as it helped â&#128;&#156;train future trainers.â&#128;&#157; Third, the partners viewed&#13;
more effective. And most important, the faculty doubted that cog-        the Global course as an opportunity to â&#128;&#156;showcaseâ&#128;&#157; Flagship training&#13;
nitive learning gains, based on correct answers to multiple choice       to initial country participants that expressed interest but werenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
questions, captured more significant learning benefits of the            clear what a national Flagship training activity might entail. And&#13;

At best, cognitive testing helped to uncover trainers or training        and ability to attract participants.&#13;
practices that were ineffectual in the extreme.&#13;
    Monitoring and evaluation challenges should not, however,&#13;
deter more systematic follow-up and assessment of impact.&#13;
Experience from the Flagship Program suggests enemies of more&#13;
systematic evaluation include (i) a lack of earmarked funding with-&#13;
in the regular budget of the World Bank Institute as well as donor&#13;
trust funds for monitoring and evaluation, and (ii) continual cor-&#13;

2 Operating as the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;learning arm,â&#128;&#157; WBI has a staff of about&#13;
250 professionals serving all Bank client countries.&#13;
3 This was complemented by a global review of existing training institutions&#13;
to identify important gaps in available training around the world and to&#13;
assure that WBI could bring real value-added to training and capacity build-&#13;
ing in this area.&#13;

5 Beginning in 2000, WBIâ&#128;&#153;s Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) now&#13;
includes approximately 120 videoconferencing sites in dozens of countries.&#13;
6 We assume the average video-conferencing activity involves about 2 days&#13;
of training even though the duration of such training activities often takes&#13;
place over 2-5 days, and sometimes for 5 or more days. This is because&#13;
video-conferencing sessions usually last only 3-4 hours per day.&#13;
7 Sponsors typically include donors, governments, and non-governmental&#13;
organizations.&#13;
8 As a benchmark of quality, WBI has established an agency wide target of&#13;
at least 80 percent of participants ranking learning activities a â&#128;&#156;4â&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;5â&#128;&#157; on&#13;
a â&#128;&#156;5â&#128;&#157; point scale.&#13;
9 Fifty of these alumni were located, with 61 percent currently in senior level&#13;
positions and an additional 22 percent at highest level of seniority.&#13;
10 In addition, the regional partners engaged country teams in health insur-&#13;
ance workshops between 2002-05, which strengthened skills and helped put&#13;
health insurance on the policy agenda in countries like Burkina Faso, Mali,&#13;
Mauritania, and Niger. More recently, the Flagship partners in Senegal and&#13;
Benin launched another set of learning activities focusing on hospital reform,&#13;
involving approximately 300 participants from countries in the region&#13;
between 2005-08.&#13;
11 The outcomes map closely to the redefinition of health system goals by&#13;
WHOâ&#128;&#153;s 200 World Health Report.&#13;

Flagship framework.&#13;
14 Costs are not reported for 2002 and 2004. In 2002 no Global core course&#13;
was delivered. In 2004, a change in venue from Washington DC to Boston&#13;
resulted in a significant drop in participants and thus unusually high unit&#13;
costs ($500). In response, the venue was moved back to Washington DC.&#13;
15 Courses offered by GDLN usually involve less than a full day of training,&#13;
many lasting around 3-4 hours. See footnote 3.&#13;
16 A caveat is that presenters at regional and especially country activities&#13;
must be sufficiently prepared to discuss complex political, cultural and&#13;
organization issues that participants tend to be well informed about.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Between 1997-2008, the World Bank
            Institute’s flagship program on health sector reform and
            sustainable financing delivered 319 short-term training
            events to more than 19,400 policy-makers, analysts, and
            implementers in 51 Bank client countries. Resource persons
            from more than 34 technical and implementation partners from
            around the world have collaborated to develop and deliver
            learning materials, approximately half located in developed
            countries and half in developing countries. This paper
            reflects on the design, implementation, impact, and lessons
            learned from the flagship program, widely regarded as the
            World Bank Institute’s most successful and longstanding
            capacity-building initiative in health in developing
            countries. Such a review is timely given current calls for
            health system strengthening and the paucity of serious
            efforts to scale up training and capacity building to this end.
