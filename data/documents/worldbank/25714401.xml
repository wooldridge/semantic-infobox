&amp;#12;Executive	summary	&#13;
	&#13;
In	2000,	the	United	Nations	(UN)	Member	States	pledged	to	work	towards	a	series	of	Millennium	&#13;
Development	Goals	(MDGs),	including	the	target	of	a	three-quarters	reduction	in	the	1990	maternal	&#13;
mortality	ratio	(MMR;	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births),	to	be	achieved	by	2015.	This	target	&#13;
(MDG	5A)	and	that	of	achieving	universal	access	to	reproductive	health	(MDG	5B)	together	formed	&#13;
the	two	targets	for	MDG	5:	Improve	maternal	health.	In	the	five	years	counting	down	to	the	&#13;
conclusion	of	the	MDGs,	a	number	of	initiatives	were	established	to	galvanize	efforts	towards	&#13;
reducing	maternal	mortality.	These	included	the	UN	Secretary-Generalâ&#128;&#153;s	Global	Strategy	for	&#13;
Womenâ&#128;&#153;s	and	Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	Health,	which	mobilized	efforts	towards	achieving	MDG	4	(Improve	child	&#13;
health)	as	well	as	MDG	5,	and	the	high-level	Commission	on	Information	and	Accountability	(COIA),	&#13;
which	promoted	â&#128;&#156;global	reporting,	oversight,	and	accountability	on	womenâ&#128;&#153;s	and	childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	healthâ&#128;&#157;.	&#13;
Now,	building	on	the	momentum	generated	by	MDG	5,	the	Sustainable	Development	Goals	(SDGs)	&#13;
establish	a	transformative	new	agenda	for	maternal	health	towards	ending	preventable	maternal	&#13;
mortality;	target	3.1	of	SDG	3	is	to	reduce	the	global	MMR	to	less	than	70	per	100	000	live	births	by	&#13;
2030.	&#13;
Planning	and	accountability	for	improving	maternal	health,	and	assessment	of	MDG	5	and	SDG	&#13;
targets,	require	accurate	and	internationally	comparable	measures	of	maternal	mortality.	Countries	&#13;
have	made	notable	progress	in	collecting	data	through	civil	registration	systems,	surveys,	censuses	&#13;
and	specialized	studies	over	the	past	decade.	Yet,	many	still	lack	comprehensive	systems	for	&#13;
capturing	vital	events	data,	and	underreporting	continues	to	pose	a	major	challenge	to	data	&#13;
accuracy.	 	&#13;
Given	the	challenges	of	obtaining	accurate	and	standardized	direct	measures	of	maternal	mortality,	&#13;
the	Maternal	Mortality	Estimation	Inter-Agency	Group	(MMEIG)	â&#128;&#147;	comprising	the	World	Health	&#13;
Organization	(WHO),	the	United	Nations	Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	Fund	(UNICEF),	the	United	Nations	Population	&#13;
Fund	(UNFPA),	World	Bank	Group	and	the	United	Nations	Population	Division	(UNPD)	â&#128;&#147;	partnered	&#13;
with	a	team	at	the	University	of	Massachusetts	Amherst,	United	States	of	America	(USA),	the	&#13;
National	University	of	Singapore,	Singapore,	and	the	University	of	California	at	Berkeley,	USA,	to	&#13;
generate	internationally	comparable	MMR	estimates	with	independent	advice	from	a	technical	&#13;
advisory	group	that	includes	scientists	and	academics	with	experience	in	measuring	maternal	&#13;
mortality.	 	&#13;
The	estimates	for	1990	to	2015	presented	in	this	report	are	the	eighth	in	a	series	of	analyses	by	the	&#13;
MMEIG	to	examine	global,	regional	and	country	progress	in	reducing	maternal	mortality.	To	&#13;
provide	increasingly	accurate	maternal	mortality	estimates,	the	previous	estimation	methods	have	&#13;
been	refined	to	optimize	use	of	country-level	data	and	estimation	of	uncertainty	around	the	&#13;
estimates.	The	methodology	used	in	this	round	by	the	MMEIG	builds	directly	upon	previous	&#13;
methods,	but	now	provides	estimates	that	are	more	informed	by	national	data.	It	also	supports	&#13;
more	realistic	assessments	of	uncertainty	about	those	estimates,	based	on	the	quality	of	data	used	&#13;
to	produce	them.	The	statistical	code	and	full	database	used	to	produce	the	current	estimates	are	&#13;
publicly	available	online.2	&#13;

&amp;#12;Globally,	the	MMR	fell	by	nearly	44%	over	the	past	25	years,	to	an	estimated	216	(80%	&#13;
uncertainty	interval	[UI]3	 207	to	249)	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births	in	2015,	from	an	&#13;
MMR	of	385	(UI	359	to	427)	in	1990.	The	annual	number	of	maternal	deaths	decreased	by	43%	from	&#13;
approximately	532	000	(UI	496	000	to	590	000)	in	1990	to	an	estimated	303	000	(UI	291	000	to	349	&#13;
000)	in	2015.	The	approximate	global	lifetime	risk	of	a	maternal	death	fell	considerably	from	1	in	73	&#13;
to	1	in	180.	&#13;
Developing	regions	account	for	approximately	99%	(302	000)	of	the	global	maternal	deaths	in	2015,	&#13;
with	sub-Saharan	Africa	alone	accounting	for	roughly	66%	(201	000),	followed	by	Southern	Asia	&#13;
(66	000).	Estimated	MMR	declined	across	all	MDG	regions4	 between	1990	and	2015,	although	the	&#13;
magnitude	of	the	reduction	differed	substantially	between	regions.	The	greatest	decline	over	that	&#13;
period	was	observed	in	Eastern	Asia	(72%).	As	of	2015,	the	two	regions	with	highest	MMR	are	&#13;
sub-Saharan	Africa	(546;	UI	511	to	652)	and	Oceania	(187;	UI	95	to	381).	 	&#13;
At	the	country	level,	Nigeria	and	India	are	estimated	to	account	for	over	one	third	of	all	maternal	&#13;
deaths	worldwide	in	2015,	with	an	approximate	58	000	maternal	deaths	(19%)	and	45	000	maternal	&#13;
deaths	(15%),	respectively.	Sierra	Leone	is	estimated	to	have	the	highest	MMR	at	1360	(UI	999	to	&#13;
1980).	Eighteen	other	countries,	all	in	sub-Saharan	Africa,	are	estimated	to	have	very	high	MMR	in	&#13;
2015,	with	estimates	ranging	from	999	down	to	500	deaths	per	100	000	live	births:	Central	African	&#13;
Republic	(881;	UI	508	to	1500),	Chad	(856;	UI	560	to	1350),	Nigeria	(814;	UI	596	to	1180),	South	&#13;
Sudan	(789;	UI	523	to	1150),	Somalia	(732;	UI	361	to	1390),	Liberia	(725;	UI	527	to	1030),	Burundi	(712;	&#13;
UI	471	to	1050),	Gambia	(706;	UI	484	to	1030),	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo	(693;	UI	509	to	&#13;
1010),	Guinea	(679;	UI	504	to	927),	CÃ´te	dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire	(645;	UI	458	to	909),	Malawi	(634;	UI	422	to	1080),	&#13;
Mauritania	(602;	UI	399	to	984),	Cameroon	(596;	UI	440	to	881),	Mali	(587;	UI	448	to	823),	Niger	&#13;
(553;	UI	411	to	752),	Guinea-Bissau	(549;	UI	273	to	1090)	and	Kenya	(510;	UI	344	to	754).	The	two	&#13;
countries	with	the	highest	estimated	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	are	Sierra	Leone	with	an	&#13;
approximate	risk	of	1	in	17,	and	Chad	with	an	approximate	risk	of	1	in	18.	The	estimated	lifetime	risk	&#13;
of	maternal	mortality	in	high-income	countries	is	1	in	3300	in	comparison	with	1	in	41	in	low-income	&#13;
countries.	 	&#13;
Emergent	humanitarian	settings	and	situations	of	conflict,	post-conflict	and	disaster	significantly	&#13;
hinder	the	progress	of	maternal	mortality	reduction.	In	such	situations,	the	breakdown	of	health	&#13;
systems	can	cause	a	dramatic	rise	in	deaths	due	to	complications	that	would	be	easily	treatable	&#13;
under	stable	conditions.	In	countries	designated	as	fragile	states,	the	estimated	lifetime	risk	of	&#13;
maternal	mortality	is	1	in	54.	&#13;
Globally,	approximately	1.6%	(4700)	of	all	maternal	deaths	are	estimated	to	be	AIDS-related	&#13;
indirect	maternal	deaths.	In	sub-Saharan	Africa,	2.0%	of	all	maternal	deaths	are	estimated	to	be	&#13;
AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths,	yielding	an	AIDS-related	indirect	MMR	of	11	maternal	&#13;
deaths	per	100	000	live	births.	In	2015	there	are	five	countries	where	10%	or	more	of	maternal	&#13;
deaths	are	estimated	to	be	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths:	South	Africa	(32%),	Swaziland	&#13;
(19%),	Botswana	(18%),	Lesotho	(13%)	and	Mozambique	(11%).	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
 	 The	uncertainty	intervals	(UI)	computed	for	all	the	estimates	refer	to	the	80%	uncertainty	intervals	(10th	and	90th	&#13;
percentiles	of	the	posterior	distributions).	This	was	chosen	as	opposed	to	the	more	standard	95%	intervals	because	of	the	&#13;
substantial	uncertainty	inherent	in	maternal	mortality	outcomes.	&#13;

&amp;#12;Nine	countries	that	had	MMR	of	more	than	100	in	1990	are	now	categorized	as	having	â&#128;&#156;achieved	&#13;
MDG	5Aâ&#128;&#157;	based	on	MMR	reduction	point-estimates	indicating	a	reduction	of	at	least	75%	between	&#13;
1990	and	2015:	Bhutan,	Cambodia,	Cabo	Verde,	the	Islamic	Republic	of	Iran,	the	Lao	Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s	&#13;
Democratic	Republic,	Maldives,	Mongolia,	Rwanda	and	Timor-Leste.	Based	on	MMR	reduction	&#13;
point-estimates	and	uncertainty	intervals	for	the	same	period,	an	additional	39	countries	are	&#13;
categorized	as	â&#128;&#156;making	progressâ&#128;&#157;,	21	are	categorized	as	having	made	â&#128;&#156;insufficient	progressâ&#128;&#157;,	and	&#13;
26	are	categorized	as	having	made	â&#128;&#156;no	progressâ&#128;&#157;.	&#13;
Achieving	the	SDG	target	of	a	global	MMR	below	70	will	require	reducing	global	MMR	by	an	average	&#13;
of	7.5%	each	year	between	2016	and	2030.	This	will	require	more	than	three	times	the	2.3%	annual	&#13;
rate	of	reduction	observed	globally	between	1990	and	2015.	&#13;
Accurate	measurement	of	maternal	mortality	levels	remains	an	immense	challenge,	but	the	overall	&#13;
message	is	clear:	hundreds	of	thousands	of	women	are	still	dying	due	to	complications	of	pregnancy	&#13;
and/or	childbirth	each	year.	Many	of	these	deaths	go	uncounted.	Working	towards	SDG	3.1	and	&#13;
ultimately	towards	ending	preventable	maternal	mortality	requires	amplifying	the	efforts	and	&#13;
progress	catalysed	by	MDG	5.	Among	countries	where	maternal	deaths	remain	high,	efforts	to	save	&#13;
lives	must	be	accelerated	and	must	also	be	paired	with	country-driven	efforts	to	accurately	register	&#13;
births	and	deaths,	including	cause	of	death	certification.	Strengthening	civil	registration	and	vital	&#13;
statistics	will	support	measurement	efforts	and	help	track	progress	towards	reaching	SDG	3.1.	&#13;
Among	those	countries	with	low	overall	maternal	mortality,	the	next	challenge	is	measuring	and	&#13;
amending	inequities	among	subpopulations.	The	new	Global	Strategy	for	Womenâ&#128;&#153;s,	Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	and	&#13;
Adolescentsâ&#128;&#153;	Health	will	spearhead	an	enhanced	global	collaborative	response	aimed	at	ending	all	&#13;
preventable	maternal	deaths.	&#13;

&amp;#12;1	      Introduction	&#13;
When	the	global	commitment	was	first	made	in	2000	to	achieve	the	Millennium	Development	Goals	&#13;
(MDGs),	United	Nations	(UN)	Member	States	pledged	to	work	towards	a	three-quarters	reduction	&#13;
in	the	1990	maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR;	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births)	by	2015.	This	&#13;
objective	(MDG	5A),	along	with	achieving	universal	access	to	reproductive	health	(MDG	5B),	formed	&#13;
the	two	targets	for	MDG	5:	Improve	maternal	health.	In	the	years	counting	down	to	the	conclusion	&#13;
of	the	MDGs,	a	number	of	initiatives	were	established	to	galvanize	efforts	towards	reducing	&#13;
maternal	mortality.	These	included	the	UN	Secretary-Generalâ&#128;&#153;s	Global	Strategy	for	Womenâ&#128;&#153;s	and	&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	Health,	which	mobilized	efforts	towards	achieving	MDG	4	(Improve	child	health)	as	well	&#13;
as	MDG	5,	and	the	high-level	Commission	on	Information	and	Accountability	(COIA),	which	&#13;
promoted	â&#128;&#156;global	reporting,	oversight,	and	accountability	on	womenâ&#128;&#153;s	and	childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	healthâ&#128;&#157;	(1,	2).	&#13;
To	build	upon	the	momentum	generated	by	MDG	5,	a	transformative	new	agenda	for	maternal	&#13;
health	has	been	laid	out	as	part	of	the	Sustainable	Development	Goals	(SDGs):	to	reduce	the	global	&#13;
MMR	to	less	than	70	per	100	000	live	births	by	2030	(SDG	3.1)	(3).	The	recent	World	Health	&#13;
Organization	(WHO)	publication,	Strategies	toward	ending	preventable	maternal	mortality	(EPMM),	&#13;
establishes	a	supplementary	national	target	that	no	country	should	have	an	MMR	greater	than	140	&#13;
per	100	000	live	births,	and	outlines	a	strategic	framework	for	achieving	these	ambitious	targets	by	&#13;
2030	(4).	&#13;
Planning	and	accountability	for	improving	maternal	health,	and	assessment	of	MDG	5	and	SDG	&#13;
targets,	require	accurate	and	internationally	comparable	measures	of	maternal	mortality.	Many	&#13;
countries	have	made	notable	progress	in	collecting	data	through	civil	registration	systems,	surveys,	&#13;
censuses	and	specialized	studies	over	the	past	decade.	This	laudable	increase	in	efforts	to	&#13;
document	maternal	deaths	provides	valuable	new	data,	but	the	diversity	of	methods	used	to	assess	&#13;
maternal	mortality	in	the	absence	of	civil	registration	systems	prevents	direct	comparisons	among	&#13;
indicators	generated.	The	2011	COIA	recommendations	emphasized	the	need	for	countries	to	&#13;
establish	civil	registration	systems	for	recording	births,	deaths	and	causes	of	death	(2).	Insufficient	&#13;
progress	has	been	made,	as	many	countries	still	lack	civil	registration	systems	and	where	such	&#13;
systems	do	exist,	underreporting	continues	to	pose	a	major	challenge	to	data	accuracy	(5).	Looking	&#13;
ahead,	one	cross-cutting	action	towards	EPMM	is	to	â&#128;&#156;improve	metrics,	measurement	systems	and	&#13;
data	quality	to	ensure	that	all	maternal	and	newborn	deaths	are	countedâ&#128;&#157;	(4).	 	&#13;
Given	the	challenges	of	obtaining	accurate	and	standardized	direct	measures	of	maternal	mortality,	&#13;
the	Maternal	Mortality	Estimation	Inter-Agency	Group	(MMEIG)	â&#128;&#147;	comprising	WHO,	the	United	&#13;
Nations	Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s	Fund	(UNICEF),	the	United	Nations	Population	Fund	(UNFPA),	the	World	Bank	&#13;
Group,	and	the	UN	Population	Division	(UNPD)	of	the	Department	of	Economic	and	Social	Affairs	â&#128;&#147;	&#13;
has	been	working	together	with	a	team	at	the	University	of	Massachusetts	Amherst,	United	States	&#13;
of	America	(USA),	the	National	University	of	Singapore,	Singapore,	and	the	University	of	California	&#13;
at	Berkeley,	USA,	to	generate	internationally	comparable	MMR	estimates.	An	independent	&#13;
technical	advisory	group	(TAG),	composed	of	demographers,	epidemiologists	and	statisticians,	&#13;
provides	technical	advice.	The	estimates	for	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	presented	in	this	report	are	the	eighth	in	a	&#13;
series	of	analyses	by	the	MMEIG	to	examine	the	global,	regional	and	country	progress	of	maternal	&#13;
mortality	(6â&#128;&#147;11).	To	provide	increasingly	accurate	estimates	of	MMR,	the	previous	estimation	&#13;
methods	have	been	refined	to	optimize	use	of	country-level	data.	 	&#13;
Consultations	with	countries	were	carried	out	following	the	development	of	preliminary	MMR	&#13;
estimates	for	the	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	period.	Consultations	aimed	to:	give	countries	the	opportunity	to	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      1&#13;
&amp;#12;review	the	country	estimates,	data	sources	and	methods;	obtain	additional	primary	data	sources	&#13;
that	may	not	have	been	previously	reported	or	used	in	the	analyses;	and	build	mutual	&#13;
understanding	of	the	strengths	and	weaknesses	of	available	data	and	ensure	broad	ownership	of	&#13;
the	results.	These	consultations	generated	substantial	additional	data	for	inclusion	in	the	estimation	&#13;
model,	demonstrating	widespread	expansion	of	in-country	efforts	to	monitor	maternal	mortality.	&#13;
Annex	1	presents	a	summary	of	the	process	and	results	of	the	2015	country	consultations.	&#13;
This	report	presents	global,	regional	and	country-level	estimates	of	trends	in	maternal	mortality	&#13;
between	1990	and	2015.	Chapter	2	describes	in	detail	the	methodology	employed	to	generate	the	&#13;
estimates.	Chapter	3	provides	the	estimates	and	interpretation	of	the	findings.	Chapter	4	assesses	&#13;
performance	in	terms	of	MDG	5,	discusses	implications	of	the	estimates	for	future	efforts	towards	&#13;
achieving	SDG	3.1,	and	closes	by	underlining	the	importance	of	improved	data	quality	for	&#13;
estimating	maternal	mortality.	The	annexes	to	this	report	present	an	overview	of	the	definitions	&#13;
and	common	approaches	for	measuring	maternal	mortality,	the	sources	of	data	for	the	country	&#13;

this	round	followed	an	improved	approach	that	built	directly	on	methods	used	to	produce	the	1990â&#128;&#147;&#13;
2008,	1990â&#128;&#147;2010	and	1990â&#128;&#147;2013	maternal	mortality	estimates	(9â&#128;&#147;13).	Estimates	for	this	round	were	&#13;
generated	using	a	Bayesian	approach,	referred	to	as	the	Bayesian	maternal	mortality	estimation	&#13;
model,	or	BMat	model	(14,	15).	This	enhanced	methodology	uses	the	same	core	estimation	method	&#13;
as	in	those	previous	rounds,	but	adds	refinements	to	optimize	the	use	of	country-specific	data	&#13;
sources.	It	provides	estimates	that	are	directly	informed	by	country-specific	data	points,	and	&#13;
uncertainty	assessments	that	account	for	the	varying	levels	of	uncertainty	associated	with	the	&#13;
different	data	points.	There	were	two	key	methodological	changes,	described	in	section	2.1.	 	&#13;
&#13;
Combined	with	the	updated	global	maternal	mortality	database,	the	BMat	model	provides	the	most	&#13;
up-to-date	maternal	mortality	estimates	yet	for	the	entire	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	timespan.	These	results	&#13;
supersede	all	previously	published	estimates	for	years	within	that	time	period,	and	differences	with	&#13;
previously	published	estimates	should	not	be	interpreted	as	representing	time	trends.	The	full	&#13;
database,	country	profiles	and	all	model	specification	code	used	are	available	online.5	&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
2.1	 Methodological	refinements	&#13;
First,	the	improved	model	estimates	data-driven	trends	for	all	countries	with	national	data,	better	&#13;
utilizing	the	substantial	amount	of	data	now	available	from	recently	established	or	strengthened	&#13;
civil	registration	systems,	population-based	surveys,	specialized	studies,	surveillance	studies	and	&#13;
censuses.	Given	the	historical	scarcity	of	data,	the	previous	iteration	of	the	MMEIG	model	&#13;
generated	estimates	for	countries	without	well	established	civil	registration	and	vital	statistics	&#13;
(CRVS)	systems	from	country-level	covariate	information	(i.e.	gross	domestic	product	per	capita	&#13;
based	on	purchasing	power	parity	conversion	[GDP],	general	fertility	rate	[GFR],	and	coverage	of	&#13;
skilled	attendants	at	birth	[SAB]).	The	new	model	still	incorporates	these	covariates,	but	the	&#13;
regression	model	has	been	modified	to	prioritize	country-level	data	on	maternal	mortality,	&#13;
whenever	available,	to	determine	national	trends	in	maternal	mortality.	 	&#13;
&#13;
Second,	the	improved	methodology	gives	data	from	higher	quality	sources	more	weight	in	the	&#13;
model	so	that	they	influence	the	final	estimates	more	than	data	that	are	less	precise	or	accurate.	&#13;
Final	estimates	convey	information	about	the	overall	quality	of	all	of	the	data	contributing	to	them	&#13;
through	the	size	of	their	uncertainty	interval	â&#128;&#147;	those	informed	by	higher	quality	data	are	more	&#13;
certain,	and	those	informed	by	lower	quality	data	are	less	certain.	&#13;
&#13;
Many	of	the	key	components	of	the	estimation	process,	including	data	adjustments,	covariates	for	&#13;
informing	estimates	in	settings	with	sparse	data,	and	how	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	&#13;
are	estimated,	remain	very	similar	in	the	BMat	model.	In	the	future,	as	data	quality	and	modelling	&#13;

overview	of	all	variables,	data	sources	and	statistical	models	involved	in	the	estimations,	and	&#13;
highlight	the	updated	components.	&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
2.2	 Model	input	variables	&#13;
Maternal	mortality	measures	&#13;
Maternal	mortality	measures	were	obtained	from	country-specific	data	sources.	Several	data	inputs	&#13;
on	maternal	mortality	were	included	in	the	analysis:	the	absolute	number	of	maternal	deaths;	the	&#13;
number	of	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births	(i.e.	the	maternal	mortality	ratio	or	MMR);	and	&#13;
the	proportion	of	maternal	deaths	out	of	all	deaths	among	women	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	years	(PM).6	 	&#13;
The	PM	was	the	primary	input	of	analysis,	because	it	is	less	affected	by	underreporting	of	all-cause	&#13;
deaths.	In	cases	where	only	the	MMR	was	reported,	this	was	converted	to	a	PM	using	the	UN	&#13;
Population	Divisionâ&#128;&#153;s	estimates	of	live	births	for	2015	(16)	and	all-cause	mortality	among	women	of	&#13;
reproductive	age	from	WHO	life	tables	(17).	In	some	cases	a	reported	PM	also	includes	&#13;
pregnancy-related	deaths	(i.e.	accidental	or	incidental	deaths	not	caused	by	the	pregnancy)	in	the	&#13;
ratio,	which	requires	adjustment.	The	absolute	number	of	maternal	deaths	reported	was	used	as	the	&#13;
model	input	for	a	small	subset	of	specialized	studies	that	assessed	the	completeness	of	deaths	&#13;
recorded	(including	confidential	enquiries	and	those	studies	which	reported	maternal	deaths	only).	&#13;
Details	on	the	types	of	country-level	maternal	mortality	data	sources,	the	type	of	variable	extracted	&#13;
from	each,	and	the	limitations	of	each	type	and	consequent	adjustments	made	are	described	in	Box	&#13;
1	and	section	2.3.	Types	of	data	sources,	variables	extracted,	and	adjustments	were	similar	to	those	&#13;
made	during	the	previous	estimation	round.	&#13;
Covariates	&#13;
To	inform	projection	of	trends	across	periods	where	data	were	sparse,	or	for	countries	with	little	or	&#13;
no	data,	the	model	included	factors	known	to	be	associated	with	maternal	mortality	as	predictor	&#13;
covariates.	These	predictor	covariates	were	originally	chosen	by	the	MMEIG	in	2010	from	a	broader	&#13;
list	of	potential	predictor	variables	that	fell	into	three	groups:	indicators	of	social	and	economic	&#13;
development	(such	as	GDP,	human	development	index	and	life	expectancy),	process	variables	&#13;
(SAB,	antenatal	care,	proportion	of	institutional	births,	etc.)	and	risk	exposure	(fertility	level).	The	&#13;
specific	variables	selected	were:	GDP,	GFR	and	the	proportion	of	births	with	SAB.	Data	for	each	of	&#13;
these	variables	were	obtained	respectively	from:	the	World	Bank	Group	(18),	the	UNPD	(16)	and	&#13;
UNICEF	(19).	Methods	used	to	derive	a	complete	series	of	annual	estimates	(1990â&#128;&#147;2015)	for	each	&#13;
covariate	are	described	in	detail	in	Annex	3.	The	most	recent	data	from	each	source	were	used	to	&#13;
update	covariates;	otherwise	little	changed	from	the	previous	estimation	round.	&#13;
Other	model	inputs	&#13;
Estimating	the	MMR	and	other	maternal	mortality	indicators	required	that	country-year	estimates	&#13;
for	live	births,	and	both	all-cause	deaths	and	deaths	due	to	HIV/AIDS	among	women	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	&#13;
years	be	included	in	the	model.	Sources	for	these	data	were	the	same	as	in	the	last	round,	but	live	&#13;

July	2015	(16).	WHO	life	tables	provided	all-cause	mortality	estimates	(17),	and	UNAIDS	provided	&#13;
AIDS-related	mortality	estimates	(20).	Details	on	the	methodology	used	to	produce	these	estimates	&#13;

 	The	sum	of	country-years	of	data	has	been	rounded.	&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
CRVS	systems	are	the	primary	(and	generally	preferred)	source	of	data	on	maternal	mortality.	&#13;
However,	many	countries	lack	such	a	system,	or	have	one	that	is	not	nationally	representative.	In	&#13;
such	situations,	other	data	sources	can	provide	valuable	information.	These	alternate	data	sources	&#13;
include	specialized	studies	on	maternal	mortality,	population-based	surveys	and	miscellaneous	&#13;
studies.	&#13;
All	data	on	maternal	mortality	include	a	degree	of	uncertainty	associated	with	the	error	in	a	&#13;
particular	data	source.	Some	data	are	always	(systematically)	lower	or	higher	than	the	true	value	of	&#13;
the	variable	being	measured.	For	example,	the	numbers	of	deaths	reported	in	CRVS	records	will	be	&#13;
systematically	lower	than	the	true	number,	because	there	will	always	be	deaths	that	go	unreported.	&#13;
This	is	referred	to	as	systematic	error.	Estimates	of	the	amount	of	systematic	error	for	a	given	data	&#13;
source	were	calculated	based	on	past	analyses	that	assessed	the	extent	to	which	data	from	that	&#13;
source	differed	from	the	truth	(as	determined	by	rigorous	specialized	studies	which	looked	to	&#13;
determine	underreporting	of	maternal	mortality,	see	Annex	4).	Based	on	these	assessments,	&#13;
adjustments	were	then	applied	to	the	data	to	account	for	systematic	error	and	bring	it	closer	to	the	&#13;
â&#128;&#156;truthâ&#128;&#157;	using	methods	similar	to	the	previous	estimation	round.	These	adjustments	contribute	&#13;
uncertainty	to	the	final	estimates	of	maternal	mortality,	since	no	adjustment	is	based	on	perfect	&#13;
information.	Data	may	also	differ	from	the	truth	in	a	direction	that	is	unpredictable.	For	example,	&#13;
human	error	when	recording	information	and	entering	it	into	a	database	may	cause	data	to	deviate	&#13;
from	the	truth	in	either	direction	(higher	or	lower).	This	is	referred	to	as	random	error,	and	it	cannot	&#13;
be	adjusted	for	but	also	adds	uncertainty	to	the	final	maternal	mortality	estimates.	&#13;
Uncertainty	due	to	random	error	and	uncertainty	due	to	adjustments	is	communicated	in	the	dataâ&#128;&#153;s	&#13;
error	variance.	Generally	speaking,	inputs	(usually	PMs)	from	data	sources	with	less	random	error	&#13;
and	less	uncertainty	in	systematic	error	(and	corresponding	adjustments)	had	smaller	variances	&#13;
than	inputs	from	data	sources	with	more	error.	In	turn,	inputs	with	smaller	variances	carried	greater	&#13;
weight	in	determining	the	final	maternal	mortality	estimates.	In	this	way,	all	data	sources	could	be	&#13;
included,	with	higher	quality	data	(containing	less	uncertainty)	having	a	greater	influence	on	&#13;
estimated	country-specific	trends	as	compared	to	lower	quality	data.	 	&#13;

     Cuba	has	had	a	complete	CRVS	system	established	since	before	1985	that	consistently	provides	high-quality	data	for	&#13;
     estimation	of	maternal	mortality.	As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	the	estimated	MMR	trend	line	closely	tracks	the	CRVS	&#13;
     data	points	throughout	the	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	time	period.	The	shaded	region	around	the	trend	line,	which	represents	the	80%	&#13;
     uncertainty	interval	(UI),	remains	roughly	the	same	width	throughout.	&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                	&#13;

     robust	CRVS	system,	and	has	conducted	numerous	additional	studies.	The	estimated	trend	line	is	therefore	influenced	&#13;
     by	covariate	information	prior	to	2000,	but	tracks	the	data	points	from	the	high-quality	data	sources	closely	after	2000.	&#13;
     Four	DHS	studies	were	conducted	in	Peru	during	the	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	period,	and	data	points	from	these	studies	also	&#13;
     influence	the	trend	line.	However,	given	the	lower	reliability	of	the	data	from	these	studies,	they	exert	less	influence	&#13;
     (the	line	does	not	track	them	as	closely)	compared	to	the	CRVS	data	points.	Finally,	the	shaded	region	around	the	trend	&#13;
     line	narrows	dramatically	as	time	progresses.	This	represents	the	narrowing	of	the	80%	UI	as	data	quality	improves	and	&#13;
     allows	estimates	to	become	more	precise.	&#13;
     Like	Peru,	many	countries	have	recently	established	CRVS	systems,	or	have	substantially	improved	the	quality	of	data	&#13;
     collected	by	their	CRVS	systems.	The	new	model	takes	advantage	of	these	new	data,	allowing	these	countriesâ&#128;&#153;	trend	&#13;
     lines	to	be	more	influenced	by	the	data	during	the	period	after	the	system	was	established,	and	increasingly	so	as	the	&#13;
     quality	improves.	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
Civil	registration	and	vital	statistics	data	&#13;
National	CRVS	systems	are	meant	to	record	all	births,	deaths	and	causes	of	death	within	a	country.	&#13;
The	data	retrieved	from	CRVS	systems	are	referred	to	as	vital	registration	(VR)	data.	For	VR	data,	&#13;
the	observed	proportion	of	maternal	deaths	among	all	deaths	to	women	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	was	included	&#13;
as	the	data	input.	For	VR	country-years	based	on	ICD-9,	deaths	coded	to	630-676	were	used	and	for	&#13;
those	based	upon	ICD-10,	deaths	coded	to	codes	O00-O95,	O98-O99	and	A34	were	used	(which	&#13;
include	only	those	maternal	deaths	for	which	the	timing	corresponds	to	the	definition	of	a	maternal	&#13;
death)8.	&#13;
Under	ideal	circumstances,	CRVS	systems	provide	perfect	data	on	the	number	of	maternal	deaths	&#13;
within	a	country.	In	reality,	however,	deaths	often	go	unrecorded	(resulting	in	incompleteness)	or	&#13;
the	causes	of	death	are	incorrectly	recorded	(resulting	in	misclassification)	both	of	which	contribute	&#13;
to	underreporting	of	maternal	deaths.	The	extent	of	underreporting	determines	a	civil	registration	&#13;
recordâ&#128;&#153;s	usability	in	the	analysis.	Usability	is	defined	as	the	percentage	of	all	deaths	among	women	&#13;
of	reproductive	age	in	the	country-year	for	which	a	cause	of	death	has	been	recorded.	It	is	&#13;
calculated	by	multiplying	the	systemâ&#128;&#153;s	completeness	(proportion	of	all-cause	deaths	that	were	&#13;
registered	in	the	system)	by	the	proportion	of	deaths	registered	in	the	system	that	were	assigned	a	&#13;
specific	ICD	cause	(see	Annex	5	for	details	on	calculating	usability).	Additionally,	the	number	of	&#13;
data-years	available	from	a	CRVS	system	in	a	given	time	period	was	used	as	a	proxy	for	the	dataâ&#128;&#153;s	&#13;
reliability,	with	regular	data	reporting	across	years	indicating	a	high-functioning	system.	Given	&#13;
these	factors,	each	country-year	of	VR	data	was	placed	into	one	of	three	categories	(type	I,	II	or	III)	&#13;
depending	on	its	usability	and	the	number	of	available	years	with	data.	Box	3	summarizes	the	&#13;
criteria	for	each	category.	The	category	determined	whether	or	not	the	record	for	that	country-year	&#13;
of	data	was	included	in	analysis,	and	if	included,	how	it	was	adjusted	to	account	for	&#13;
misclassification.	&#13;
&#13;
																																																																				&#13;

 	 A	maternal	death	is	defined	as	the	death	of	a	woman	while	pregnant	or	within	42	days	of	termination	of	pregnancy,	&#13;
irrespective	of	the	duration	and	site	of	the	pregnancy,	from	any	cause	related	to	or	aggravated	by	the	pregnancy	or	its	&#13;
management	(from	direct	or	indirect	obstetric	death),	but	not	from	accidental	or	incidental	causes.	&#13;

                                                                                                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;This	method	of	categorizing	each	year	of	a	countryâ&#128;&#153;s	VR	data,	rather	than	placing	all	of	a	countryâ&#128;&#153;s	&#13;
data	into	the	same	category	(as	in	the	previous	estimation	round),	takes	into	account	changes	in	&#13;
data	quality	over	time.	For	example,	if	a	country	strengthens	its	CRVS	system,	data	from	years	after	&#13;
the	system	improvement	can	be	categorized	as	type	I,	even	if	data	from	earlier	years	were	classified	&#13;
as	type	II.	Annex	5	includes	a	table	listing	the	calculated	data	usability	for	selected	years	of	VR	data,	&#13;

&#13;
	&#13;
Initial	adjustment	factors	for	all	VR	data	(types	I,	II	and	III)	were	determined	using	procedures	similar	&#13;
to	those	used	in	previous	estimation	rounds.	For	countries	with	type	I	data	that	have	not	conducted	&#13;
specialized	studies	(to	assess	the	extent	of	systematic	error	in	VR	data;	see	next	subsection	for	&#13;
further	information),	the	number	of	maternal	deaths	was	multiplied	by	an	adjustment	factor	of	1.5,	&#13;
as	determined	by	a	review	of	findings	from	49	specialized	studies,	which	was	conducted	in	2014	(the	&#13;
findings	are	summarized	in	Annex	4).	However,	for	countries	with	type	I	data	that	have	conducted	&#13;
at	least	one	specialized	study,	the	findings	from	the	specialized	study	informed	the	adjustment	&#13;
factor	applied	to	that	countryâ&#128;&#153;s	VR	data.	Calculation	of	adjustment	factors	was	based	on	the	&#13;
approach	used	in	the	last	estimation	round,	and	the	methods	are	described	in	the	paper	by	Alkema	&#13;
et	al.	(15).	Any	civil	registration	records	covering	the	same	periods	for	which	specialized	study	data	&#13;
were	available	were	excluded	to	avoid	double	counting	of	the	same	information.	&#13;
For	countries	with	type	II	data,	a	similar	procedure	was	used	as	described	for	countries	with	type	I	&#13;
data	to	obtain	initial	estimates	of	adjustments	factors	for	civil	registration	records	(either	1.5	or	&#13;
values	indicated	by	specialized	studies).	However,	for	type	II	and	III	data,	the	model	set-up	included	&#13;
the	possibility	of	higher	adjustment	factors	depending	on	data	quality,	with	the	possibility	of	&#13;
estimating	a	larger	adjustment	factor	decreasing	as	usability	increases	(15).	In	addition	to	the	&#13;
systematic	errors	described	above,	and	the	uncertainty	associated	with	those	adjustments,	the	&#13;
observed	PMs	obtained	from	civil	registration	records	are	subject	to	stochastic	error,	attributed	to	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      9&#13;
&amp;#12;maternal	mortality	being	a	generally	rare	event.	&#13;
Specialized	studies	on	maternal	mortality	&#13;
A	number	of	countries	reporting	maternal	deaths	via	CRVS	systems	also	conducted	specialized	&#13;
studies	to	determine	if	maternal	deaths	were	underreported.	While	the	methodology	for	these	&#13;
studies	varies,	any	nationally	representative	study	that	documented	corrections	to	data	previously	&#13;
submitted	to	the	WHO	mortality	database	was	considered	a	specialized	study.	These	studies	were	&#13;
used	to	inform	maternal	mortality	estimates	as	well	as	VR	data	misclassification	adjustment	factors.	&#13;
Examples	include	those	conducted	in	Guatemala	and	the	United	Kingdom,	which	reviewed	a	&#13;
representative	sample	of	the	population	using	methods	such	as	verbal	autopsy	to	identify	and	&#13;
correctly	categorize	causes	of	death;	or	studies	such	as	those	conducted	in	Australia,	Mexico	and	&#13;
the	United	Kingdom,	which	used	the	Confidential	Enquiry	system	to	review	the	classification	and	&#13;
completeness	of	death	reporting	for	deaths	among	women	of	reproductive	age	in	a	vital	events	&#13;
database.	&#13;
Information	from	specialized	studies	was	summarized	into	an	observed	PM.	The	PM	or	MMR	&#13;
reported	in	the	study	was	generally	used,	except	for	Confidential	Enquiries	or	other	specialized	&#13;
studies	reporting	on	maternal	deaths	only,	which	addressed	both	potential	underreporting	of	&#13;
maternal	deaths	as	well	as	the	total	deaths	among	women	of	reproductive	age	during	the	study	&#13;
time	period;	for	those	studies,	the	absolute	number	of	maternal	deaths	observed	was	used	directly	&#13;
as	a	model	input.	All	data	inputs	from	specialized	studies	were	used	to	inform	the	modelled	&#13;
maternal	mortality	estimates,	without	further	adjustments.	The	only	studies	excluded	from	analysis	&#13;
were	those	that	did	not	report	the	total	number	of	all-cause	deaths	among	women	of	reproductive	&#13;
age	or	associated	births	within	the	study	period,	and	for	which	that	information	was	not	available	&#13;
from	the	CRVS	system.	&#13;
Model	inputs	from	specialized	studies	were	assumed	to	have	no	systematic	error.	Sources	of	&#13;
random	error	are	the	same	as	those	for	VR	data.	&#13;
Population-based	surveys	and	other	data	sources	&#13;
Examples	of	population-based	surveys	include	the	Demographic	and	Health	Surveys	(DHS),	&#13;
Multiple	Indicator	Cluster	Surveys	â&#128;&#147;	Round	4	(MICS4),	and	Reproductive	Health	Surveys.	Other	data	&#13;
sources	include	censuses	and	surveillance	systems.	&#13;
Many	surveys	include	questions	inquiring	whether	deceased	women	of	reproductive	age	died	during	&#13;
pregnancy	or	shortly	after.	For	example,	DHS	and	MICS	both	use	the	direct	â&#128;&#156;sisterhoodâ&#128;&#157;	method	in	&#13;
which	they	ask	respondents	about	the	survival	of	all	of	their	siblings.	Such	surveys	therefore	collect	&#13;
data	on	pregnancy-related	deaths,	which	are	used	to	compute	the	pregnancy-related	PM.	Other	&#13;
studies	obtain	and	report	the	PM,	and	some	may	report	a	pregnancy-related	MMR	rather	than	PM	if	&#13;
information	on	births	is	collected	and	information	on	all	causes	of	deaths	among	women	of	&#13;
reproductive	age	is	not	collected.	&#13;
Specialized	studies	indicate	that	there	is	some	underreporting	of	maternal	or	pregnancy-related	&#13;
deaths	in	PMs	derived	from	sources	such	as	population-based	surveys,	censuses	and	surveillance	&#13;
studies,	particularly	since	respondents	may	be	unaware	of	the	pregnancy	status	of	their	sisters	or	&#13;
other	women	in	the	household.	If	no	specific	adjustments	were	reported,	estimates	for	these	data	&#13;
sources	were	revised	to	increase	the	number	of	maternal	or	pregnancy-related	deaths	by	10%	to	&#13;
correct	for	underreporting.	When	pregnancy-related	deaths	were	reported,	the	number	was	&#13;
adjusted	downward	by	10%	for	sub-Saharan	African	countries	and	15%	in	other	low-	and	middle-	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   10&#13;
&amp;#12;income	countries	to	correct	for	inclusion	of	incidental	and	accidental	deaths	(21).	As	in	previous	&#13;
estimation	rounds,	for	studies	that	excluded	deaths	due	to	accidents	when	calculating	&#13;
pregnancy-related	PMs,	the	calculated	PMs	were	taken	and	used	as	model	inputs	without	any	&#13;
further	adjustment.	&#13;
In	addition	to	the	sources	of	systematic	error	discussed	above,	sources	of	random	error	for	model	&#13;
inputs	derived	from	surveys,	censuses	and	other	types	of	studies	include	sampling	error	and	errors	&#13;
occurring	during	the	data	collection	and	data	administration	processes.	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
2.4	 Statistical	modelling	to	estimate	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	maternal	mortality	 	&#13;
Summary	of	methods	&#13;
Limited	data	availability	for	many	countries,	and	the	limitations	of	the	data	that	are	available,	mean	&#13;
that	statistical	models	are	needed	for	generating	comparable	estimates	of	maternal	mortality	&#13;
across	countries.	The	BMat	model	is	flexible	enough	to	account	for	differences	in	data	availability	&#13;
and	quality.	Therefore,	the	same	statistical	model	can	now	be	used	to	generate	estimates	for	all	&#13;
countries.	 	&#13;
As	in	previous	MMEIG	estimation	rounds,	the	MMR	for	each	country-year	is	modelled	as	the	sum	of	&#13;
the	AIDS-related	indirect	MMR	and	the	non-AIDS-related	MMR:	&#13;
        MMR	=	non-AIDS-related	MMR	+	AIDS-related	indirect	MMR,	&#13;
where	non-AIDS-related	maternal	deaths	refer	to	maternal	deaths	due	to	direct	obstetric	causes	or	&#13;
to	indirect	causes	other	than	HIV,	while	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	are	those	&#13;
AIDS-related	deaths	for	which	pregnancy	was	a	substantial	aggravating	factor.	&#13;
The	estimation	of	the	AIDS-related	indirect	MMR	follows	the	same	procedure	as	used	in	previous	&#13;
publications	(9â&#128;&#147;11)	and	is	described	in	detail	in	Annex	6.	&#13;
The	expected	non-AIDS-related	MMR	for	the	year	1990,	and	expected	changes	in	the	&#13;
non-AIDS-related	MMR	from	1990	to	2015,	are	obtained	through	the	multilevel	regression	model	&#13;
that	was	used	in	previous	estimation	rounds	(explained	in	more	detail	below	in	this	subsection).	&#13;
However,	this	existing	model	was	extended	to	enable	it	to	capture	country-specific	data-driven	&#13;
trends.	To	do	this,	it	now	includes	information	from	the	data	via	a	country-year-specific	multiplier.	&#13;
The	result	of	this	approach	is	that	in	country-year	periods	where	high-quality	data	exist,	the	data	&#13;
dominate	(i.e.	the	estimates	produced	are	closer	to	the	data),	and	in	cases	where	there	are	no	data,	&#13;
the	regression	determines	the	level	and	trend	of	estimates.	In	between,	both	sources	of	information	&#13;
inform	the	estimate	of	a	countryâ&#128;&#153;s	level	and	trend.	For	countries	with	high-quality	VR	data,	the	&#13;
model	tracks	the	data	very	closely,	while	providing	some	smoothing	of	the	curve	over	time	to	&#13;
remove	stochastic	fluctuations	in	the	data.	 	&#13;
In	the	new	model,	the	non-AIDS-related	MMR	is	estimated	for	all	countries	as	follows:	&#13;
        Non-AIDS-related	MMR(t)	=	expected	non-AIDS-related	MMR(t)	x	data-driven	multiplier(t),	&#13;
where	â&#128;&#156;expected	non-AIDS-related	MMR(t)â&#128;&#157;	is	estimated	from	the	multilevel	regression	model,	and	&#13;
the	â&#128;&#156;data-driven	multiplier(t)â&#128;&#157;	allows	for	differences	in	the	rate	of	change	in	MMR	implied	by	the	&#13;
â&#128;&#156;expected	non-AIDS-related	MMRâ&#128;&#157;	and	country-year-specific	data	points.	For	example,	if	data	&#13;
suggested	that	the	non-AIDS-related	MMR	decreased	much	faster	in	year	t	than	expected	based	on	&#13;
covariates,	the	data-driven	multiplier	for	that	year	is	estimated	to	be	greater	than	1,	allowing	the	&#13;
                                                                                                      11&#13;
&amp;#12;model	to	produce	estimates	that	closely	track	country	data.	This	data-driven	multiplier	is	modelled	&#13;
with	a	flexible	time	series	model,	which	fluctuates	around	1,	such	that	the	covariates	determine	the	&#13;
estimated	change	when	data	are	absent	(for	further	details	on	the	multiplier	please	see	the	&#13;
technical	paper	[15]).	&#13;
The	extension	of	the	non-AIDS-related	MMR	to	allow	for	country-specific	data	trends	was	the	main	&#13;
revision	in	the	MMEIG	model,	as	compared	to	the	previous	estimation	approach.	The	second	&#13;
significant	change	to	the	model	was	the	use	of	integrated	data	models	to	allow	for	uncertainty	&#13;
around	data	inputs	to	be	incorporated	into	the	estimates.	For	example,	the	PM	from	a	DHS	with	a	&#13;
small	sample	size	is	assumed	to	be	less	precise	than	a	PM	from	a	DHS	with	a	large	sample	size.	As	&#13;
explained	in	section	2.3,	this	uncertainty	is	taken	into	account	by	the	model	when	generating	PM	&#13;
and	thus	MMR	estimates;	observations	with	smaller	error	variances	are	more	informative	of	the	true	&#13;
PM	and	thus	will	carry	a	greater	weight	in	determining	the	estimates	as	compared	to	observations	&#13;
with	larger	error	variances.	&#13;
All	analyses	were	conducted	using	JAGS	3Â·3Â·0	and	R;	both	are	open-source	statistical	software	&#13;
packages	(22,	23).	Statistical	code	can	be	accessed	online.9	&#13;

Multilevel	regression	model	&#13;
A	multilevel	regression	model	was	used	to	obtain	the	expected	number	of	non-AIDS-related	&#13;
maternal	deaths	for	each	country-year.	The	model	predicts	maternal	mortality	using	three	predictor	&#13;
variables	described	in	section	2.2.	The	model	can	be	described	as	follows:	&#13;
                log(PMina)	=	Î±i	â&#128;&#147;	Î²1	log(GDPi)	+	Î²2	log(GFRi)	â&#128;&#147;	Î²3	SABi	&#13;
with	random	country	intercepts	modelled	hierarchically	within	regions:	&#13;
     	          Î±i ~ N(Î±region, Ï&#131;2country), Î±r ~ N(Î±world, Ï&#131;2region)&#13;
                                                                                              2&#13;
meaning	country	intercepts	(Î±i)	are	distributed	normally	with	a	country-specific	variance	(Ï&#131; country)	&#13;
around	random	region	intercepts	(Î±region),	and	random	region	intercepts	(Î±region)	are	distributed	&#13;
                                            2&#13;
normally	with	a	region-specific	variance	(Ï&#131; region)	around	a	world	intercept	(Î±world);	&#13;
and:	&#13;
                GDPi	=	gross	domestic	product	per	capita	(in	2011	PPP	dollars)	&#13;
                GFRi	=	general	fertility	rate	(live	births	per	woman	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	years)	&#13;
                SABi	=	skilled	attendant	at	birth	(as	a	proportion	of	total	births).	&#13;
	&#13;
For	countries	with	data	available	on	maternal	mortality,	the	expected	proportion	of	&#13;
non-AIDS-related	maternal	deaths	was	based	on	country	and	regional	random	effects,	whereas	for	&#13;
countries	with	no	data	available,	predictions	were	derived	using	regional	random	effects	only.	&#13;

&amp;#12;2.5	 Maternal	mortality	indicators	estimated	by	the	model	 	&#13;
The	immediate	outputs	of	the	BMat	model	were	estimates	in	the	form	of	PMs.	These	values	were	&#13;
then	converted	to	estimates	of	the	MMR	as	follows:	&#13;
        MMR	=	PM(D/B),	&#13;
where	D	is	the	number	of	deaths	in	women	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	years	and	B	is	the	number	of	live	births	for	&#13;
the	country-year	corresponding	to	the	estimate.	&#13;
Based	on	MMR	estimates,	the	annual	rate	of	MMR	reduction	(ARR)	and	the	maternal	mortality	rate	&#13;
(MMRate;	the	number	of	maternal	deaths	divided	by	person-years	lived	by	women	of	reproductive	&#13;
age	[13])	were	calculated.	The	ARR	was	calculated	as	follows:	 	&#13;
        ARR	=	log(MMRt2/MMRt1)/(t1â&#128;&#147;t2),	 	&#13;
where	t1	and	t2	refer	to	different	years	with	t1	&lt;	t2.	 	&#13;
The	MMRate	was	calculated	by	using	the	number	of	maternal	deaths	divided	by	the	number	of	&#13;
women	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	in	the	population,	as	estimated	by	UNPD	in	World	population	prospects:	2015	&#13;
revision	(16).	The	MMRate	was	used	to	calculate	the	adult	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	(i.e.	the	&#13;
probability	that	a	15-year-old	woman	will	die	eventually	from	a	maternal	cause).	In	countries	where	&#13;
there	is	a	high	risk	of	maternal	death,	there	is	also	an	elevated	likelihood	of	girls	dying	before	&#13;
reaching	reproductive	age.	For	this	reason,	it	makes	sense	to	consider	the	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	&#13;
mortality	conditional	on	a	girlâ&#128;&#153;s	survival	to	adulthood.	The	formula	used	yields	an	estimate	of	the	&#13;
lifetime	risk	that	takes	into	account	competing	causes	of	death:	&#13;
        Lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	=	(T15-T50)/	â&#132;&#147;15	x	MMRate,	 	&#13;
where	â&#132;&#147;15	equals	the	probability	of	survival	from	birth	until	age	15	years,	and	(T15	â&#128;&#147;	T50)/â&#132;&#147;15	equals	&#13;
the	average	number	of	years	lived	between	ages	15	and	50	years	(up	to	a	maximum	of	35	years)	&#13;
among	survivors	to	age	15	years.	The	values	for	â&#132;&#147;15,	T15	and	T50	are	life-table	quantities	for	the	&#13;
female	population	during	the	period	in	question.	&#13;
Regional	maternal	mortality	estimates	(according	to	the	MDG,	UNFPA,	UNICEF,	UNPD,	WHO	and	&#13;
the	World	Bank	Group	regional	groupings)	were	also	computed.	The	MMR	in	a	given	region	was	&#13;
computed	as	the	estimated	total	number	of	maternal	deaths	divided	by	the	number	of	live	births	for	&#13;
that	region.	Additionally,	the	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	was	based	on	the	weighted	average	&#13;
of	(T15	â&#128;&#147;	T50)/â&#132;&#147;15	for	a	given	region,	multiplied	by	the	MMRate	of	that	region.	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
2.6	 Uncertainty	assessment	&#13;
Accurately	estimating	maternal	mortality	proves	challenging	due	to	many	countriesâ&#128;&#153;	limited	data	&#13;
availability,	and	due	to	quality	issues	affecting	the	data	that	are	available.	The	improved	model	&#13;
provides	a	more	realistic	assessment	of	uncertainty	around	the	estimates	based	on	the	amount	and	&#13;
quality	of	input	data.	It	allows	for	greater	precision	when	more	and	better	data	are	available	and	&#13;
indicates	the	extent	of	estimate	uncertainty	in	cases	where	there	the	amount	of	data	is	insufficient	&#13;
or	the	data	are	from	sources	more	susceptible	to	error.	It	should	be	noted,	however,	that	the	&#13;
uncertainty	assessment	does	not	include	the	uncertainty	in	covariates	or	other	model	input	&#13;
variables	other	than	maternal	mortality	data.	&#13;
Model	input	data	quality	decreases	with	increasing	systematic	error	and	random	error	(discussed	for	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;each	data	type	in	section	2.3),	introducing	uncertainty.	This	uncertainty	is	then	carried	through	to	&#13;
the	final	estimates.	Bayesian	models	allow	for	accurate	assessment	of	the	extent	of	uncertainty	for	&#13;
a	given	estimated	indicator	by	generating	a	posterior	distribution	of	that	indicatorâ&#128;&#153;s	potential	&#13;
values.	A	Markov	Chain	Monte	Carlo	(MCMC)	algorithm	was	used	to	generate	samples	of	the	&#13;
posterior	distributions	of	all	model	parameters	(24).	The	sampling	algorithm	produced	a	set	of	&#13;
trajectories	of	the	MMR	for	each	country,	from	which	other	indicators	and	aggregate	outcomes	&#13;
were	derived.	This	distribution	is	then	used	to	compute	a	point-estimate	and	uncertainty	interval	&#13;
(UI)	for	the	indicator.	In	this	case	80%	UIs	were	calculated	(rather	than	the	standard	95%)	because	&#13;
of	the	substantial	uncertainty	inherent	in	maternal	mortality	outcomes.	 	&#13;
The	extent	of	uncertainty	about	a	particular	estimate,	indicated	by	the	size	of	the	80%	UI,	is	&#13;
determined	by	the	amount	and	quality	of	data	used	to	produce	that	estimate.	For	a	country	with	&#13;
very	accurate	sources	of	maternal	mortality	data,	the	MMR	can	be	estimated	with	greater	precision,	&#13;
and	the	80%	UI	will	be	smaller	than	for	a	country	with	little	data,	or	with	data	from	less	reliable	&#13;
sources.	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
2.7	 Model	validation	&#13;
The	BMat	modelâ&#128;&#153;s	predictive	validity	was	assessed	by	cross-validation.	This	procedure	involves	&#13;
removing	a	subset	of	records	from	the	data	set,	re-fitting	the	model	to	that	smaller	data	set,	and	&#13;
then	seeing	how	well	the	modelâ&#128;&#153;s	new	estimates	match	the	records	that	were	removed	(taking	into	&#13;
account	systematic	errors).	If	the	modelâ&#128;&#153;s	new	estimates	are	similar	to	the	dropped	data,	it	provides	&#13;
evidence	that	the	model	can	accurately	predict	the	values	of	missing	data,	which	is	important	&#13;
because	data	on	maternal	mortality	is	very	limited	for	many	countries.	Another	variation	was	also	&#13;
run	in	which	data	from	the	most	recent	time	period	were	dropped	and	then	estimates	were	&#13;
produced	using	the	remaining	data.	Results	from	this	validation	process	indicate	that	the	model	is	&#13;
robust	and	adequately	calibrated	to	generate	the	estimates	for	global	maternal	mortality	&#13;
indicators.	 	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
    Box 4&#13;
    Accurately interpreting point-estimates and uncertainty intervals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2015 estimation round include a point-estimate and&#13;
     an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). For those indicators where only point-estimates are reported in the&#13;
                                                                                         10&#13;
     text or tables, UIs can be obtained from supplementary material online.                  Both point-estimates and&#13;
     80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.&#13;
     For example:&#13;
                                             The estimated 2015 global MMR is 216 (UI 207 to 249)&#13;
     This means:&#13;
            â&#128;¢       The point-estimate is 216 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 207 to 249.&#13;
            â&#128;¢       There is a 50% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 216, and a 50% chance that&#13;

              the true value lies below 216.&#13;
         â&#128;¢    There is an 80% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies between 207 and 249.&#13;
         â&#128;¢    There is still a 10% chance that the true 2015 global MMR lies above 249, and a 10% chance&#13;
              that the true value lies below 207.&#13;
     Other accurate interpretations include:&#13;
         â&#128;¢    We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is at least 207.&#13;
         â&#128;¢    We are 90% certain that the true 2015 global MMR is 249 or less.&#13;
&#13;
     The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width&#13;
     of an indicatorâ&#128;&#153;s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicatorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     true value lies close to the point-estimate.&#13;

&amp;#12;3	              Analysis	and	interpretation	of	the	2015	estimates	&#13;
Globally,	the	maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR;	number	of	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births)	fell	&#13;
by	approximately	44%	over	the	past	25	years;	this	falls	short	of	the	Millennium	Development	Goal	&#13;
(MDG)	target	MDG	5A	which	called	for	a	reduction	of	at	least	75%	in	MMR.	All	MDG	regions11	 of	the	&#13;
world	have	experienced	considerable	reductions	in	maternal	mortality.	This	section	describes	&#13;
estimated	MMRs,	global	maternal	deaths,	and	adult	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	(i.e.	the	&#13;
probability	that	a	15-year-old	woman	will	die	eventually	from	a	maternal	cause).	It	then	examines	&#13;
trends	in	these	indicators	since	1990.	&#13;
The	numbers	provided	are	the	most	accurate	point-estimates	possible	given	the	available	data.	&#13;
However,	these	calculations	still	contain	a	level	of	uncertainty	that	varies	depending	on	the	amount	&#13;
and	quality	of	available	data	used	to	produce	them.	The	range	that	an	estimated	indicatorâ&#128;&#153;s	true	&#13;
value	most	likely	falls	within	is	captured	by	its	80%	uncertainty	interval	(see	Box	4,	Chapter	2).	&#13;
Uncertainty	intervals	(UI)	are	therefore	given	after	all	MMR	point-estimates	and	MMR	reduction	&#13;

3.1	 Maternal	mortality	estimates	for	2015	&#13;
An	estimated	303	000	maternal	deaths	will	occur	globally	in	2015,	yielding	an	overall	MMR	of	216	(UI	&#13;
207	to	249)	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births	for	the	183	countries	and	territories	covered	in	&#13;
this	analysis	(i.e.	all	those	with	a	population	higher	than	100	000)	(see	Table	2).	The	global	lifetime	&#13;
risk	of	maternal	mortality	is	approximately	1	in	180	for	2015.	Table	2	provides	point-estimates	of	&#13;
global	and	regional	maternal	mortality	indicators,	and	the	range	of	uncertainty	for	each	MMR	&#13;
point-estimate.	For	the	purpose	of	categorization,	MMR	is	considered	to	be	high	if	it	is	300â&#128;&#147;499,	&#13;
very	high	if	it	is	500â&#128;&#147;999	and	extremely	high	if	it	is	â&#137;¥	1000	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births.	&#13;

Regional	estimates	&#13;
The	overall	MMR	in	developing	regions	is	239	(UI	229	to	275),	which	is	roughly	20	times	higher	than	&#13;
that	of	developed	regions,	where	it	is	just	12	(UI	11	to	14)	(see	Table	2).	Sub-Saharan	Africa	has	a	&#13;
very	high	MMR12	 with	a	point-estimate	of	546	(UI	511	to	652).	Three	regions	â&#128;&#147;	Oceania	(187;	UI	95	&#13;
to	381),	Southern	Asia	(176;	UI	153	to	216)	and	South-eastern	Asia	(110;	UI	95	to	142)	â&#128;&#147;	have	&#13;
moderate	MMR.	The	remaining	five	regions	have	low	MMR.	&#13;
Developing	regions	account	for	approximately	99%	(302	000)	of	the	estimated	global	maternal	&#13;
deaths	in	2015,	with	sub-Saharan	Africa	alone	accounting	for	roughly	66%	(201	000),	followed	by	&#13;
Southern	Asia	(66	000).	Among	the	developing	regions,	the	fewest	maternal	deaths	(an	estimated	&#13;
500)	occurred	in	Oceania.	&#13;
The	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	is	estimated	at	1	in	36	in	sub-Saharan	Africa,	contrasting	&#13;
sharply	with	approximately	1	in	4900	in	developed	countries.	Developing	regions	with	the	lowest	&#13;
lifetime	risk	are	Eastern	Asia	(1	in	2300)	and	Caucasus	and	Central	Asia	(1	in	1100).	&#13;
Table	3	shows	the	number	of	maternal	deaths,	MMR	and	percentage	of	AIDS-related	indirect	&#13;
maternal	deaths	by	MDG	region	in	2015.	Annex	7	provides	the	percentage	of	AIDS-related	indirect	&#13;

indirect	MMR	for	sub-Saharan	Africa	of	11	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births.	Without	HIV,	the	&#13;
MMR	for	sub-Saharan	Africa	in	2015	would	be	535	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births.	Two	&#13;

Sierra	Leone	is	estimated	to	have	the	highest	MMR	at	1360	(UI	999	to	1980)	deaths	per	100	000	live	&#13;
births	in	2015.	Eighteen	other	countries,	all	in	sub-Saharan	Africa,	are	estimated	to	have	very	high	&#13;
MMR	in	2015,	with	estimates	ranging	from	999	down	to	500:	Central	African	Republic	(882;	UI	508	&#13;
to	1500),	Chad	(856;	UI	560	to	1350),	Nigeria	(814;	UI	596	to	1180),	South	Sudan	(789;	UI	523	to	&#13;
1150),	Somalia	(732;	UI	361	to	1390),	Liberia	(725;	UI	527	to	1030),	Burundi	(712;	UI	471	to	1050),	&#13;
Gambia	(706;	UI	484	to	1030),	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo	(693;	UI	509	to	1010),	Guinea	(679;	&#13;
UI	504	to	927),	CÃ´te	dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire	(645;	UI	458	to	909),	Malawi	(634;	UI	422	to	1080),	Mauritania	(602;	&#13;
UI	399	to	984),	Cameroon	(596;	UI	440	to	881),	Mali	(587;	UI	448	to	823),	Niger	(553;	UI	411	to	752),	&#13;
Guinea-Bissau	(549;	UI	273	to	1090)	and	Kenya	(510;	UI	344	to	754).	Only	two	countries	in	&#13;
sub-Saharan	Africa	â&#128;&#147;	Mauritius	(53;	UI	38	to	77)	and	Cabo	Verde	(42;	UI	20	to	95)	â&#128;&#147;	have	low	MMR.	&#13;
Three	countries	outside	the	sub-Saharan	African	region	have	high	MMR:	Afghanistan	(396;	UI	253	to	&#13;
620),	Yemen	(385;	UI	274	to	582)	and	Haiti	(359;	UI	236	to	601).	 	&#13;
Nigeria	and	India	account	for	over	one	third	of	all	global	maternal	deaths	in	2015,	with	an	&#13;
approximate	58	000	(UI	42	000	to	84	000)	maternal	deaths	(19%)	and	45	000	(UI	36	000	to	56	000)	&#13;
maternal	deaths	(15%),	respectively.	Ten	countries	account	for	nearly	59%	of	global	maternal	&#13;
deaths.	In	addition	to	Nigeria	and	India,	they	are	(in	descending	order	of	numbers	of	maternal	&#13;
deaths):	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo	(22	000;	UI	16	000	to	33	000),	Ethiopia	(11	000;	UI	7900	&#13;
to	18	000),	Pakistan	(9700;	UI	6100	to	15	000),	United	Republic	of	Tanzania	(8200;	UI	5800	to	&#13;
12	000),	Kenya	(8000;	UI	5400	to	12	000),	Indonesia	(6400;	UI	4700	to	9000),	Uganda	(5700;	UI	4100	&#13;
to	8200)	and	Bangladesh	(5500;	UI	3900	to	8800).	&#13;
Regarding	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality,	the	two	countries	with	the	highest	estimates	are	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   21&#13;
&amp;#12;Sierra	Leone	with	an	approximate	lifetime	risk	of	1	in	17,	and	Chad	with	an	approximate	lifetime	risk	&#13;
of	1	in	18.	The	estimated	risk	in	high-income	countries	is	1	in	3300	in	comparison	with	1	in	41	in	&#13;
low-income	countries.	 	&#13;
Annex	7	presents	the	percentage	of	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	by	country	for	countries	&#13;
with	an	HIV	prevalence	of	at	least	5.0%	among	adults	aged	15â&#128;&#147;49	years,	between	1990	and	2015.	&#13;
Although	at	a	regional	level	the	overall	proportions	of	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	are	&#13;
relatively	small,	for	countries	with	high	HIV	prevalence	they	are	substantial.	In	2015,	there	are	five	&#13;
countries	where	10%	or	more	of	maternal	deaths	are	estimated	to	be	AIDS-related	indirect	&#13;
maternal	deaths:	South	Africa	(32%),	Swaziland	(19%),	Botswana	(18%),	Lesotho	(13%)	and	&#13;
Mozambique	(11%).	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2	 Trends	in	MMR	from	1990	to	2015	&#13;
An	estimated	global	total	of	13.6	million	women	have	died	in	the	25	years	between	1990	and	2015	due	&#13;
to	maternal	causes.	Over	the	course	of	that	time,	however,	the	world	has	made	steady	progress	in	&#13;
reducing	maternal	mortality.	The	global	MMR	has	fallen	by	44%	(UI	33.1%	to	47.5%),	from	the	1990	&#13;
level	of	385	(UI	359	to	427)	to	the	2015	level	of	216	(UI	207	to	249).	This	translates	to	a	decrease	of	over	&#13;
43%	in	the	estimated	annual	number	of	maternal	deaths,	from	532	000	(UI	496	000	to	590	000)	in	1990	&#13;
to	303	000	(UI	291	000	to	349000)	in	2015,	and	a	more	than	halving	of	the	approximate	global	lifetime	&#13;
risk	of	a	maternal	death	from	1	in	73	to	1	in	180.	Worldwide,	MMR	declined	by	an	average	of	3.0%	(UI	&#13;
2.1%	to	3.4%)	per	year	between	2005	and	2015,	more	than	doubling	the	estimated	average	annual	&#13;
decline	of	1.2%	(UI	0.5%	to	2.0%)	between	1990	and	2000.	Table	4	compares	estimates	of	MMR	and	&#13;
numbers	of	maternal	deaths	at	the	global	and	regional	levels	for	1990	and	2015.	&#13;

Regional	estimates	&#13;
Estimated	MMR	declined	across	all	MDG	regions	between	1990	and	2015,	although	the	magnitude	of	&#13;
the	reduction	differed	substantially	between	regions	(Annex	18).	When	interpreting	change	in	MMR,	&#13;
one	should	take	into	consideration	that	it	is	easier	to	reduce	MMR	when	levels	are	high	than	when	&#13;
they	are	low.	The	highest	decline	between	1990	and	2015	was	observed	in	Eastern	Asia	(72%),	&#13;
followed	by	Southern	Asia	(67%),	South-eastern	Asia	(66%),	Northern	Africa	(59%),	Caucasus	and	&#13;
Central	Asia	(52%),	Oceania	(52%),	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	(50%),	sub-Saharan	Africa	(45%)	&#13;
and	Western	Asia	(43%).	The	decline	in	developed	regions	was	48%.	 	&#13;
In	the	developing	regions,	the	annual	rate	of	MMR	reduction	was	1.3%	(UI	0.6%	to	2.0%)	between	&#13;
1990	and	2000,	and	progress	accelerated	to	an	annual	rate	of	3.1%	(UI	2.2%	to	3.5%)	between	2000	&#13;
and	2015.	Overall,	this	translates	to	an	estimated	2.4%	(UI	1.7%	to	2.7%)	average	yearly	reduction	over	&#13;
the	past	25	years.	Eastern	Asia	experienced	the	highest	estimated	annual	rate	of	decline	with	an	&#13;
average	yearly	MMR	decrease	of	5.0%	(UI	4.0%	to	6.0%)	between	1990	and	2015.	The	lowest	&#13;
estimated	annual	rate	of	decline	occurred	in	Western	Asia,	where	MMR	decreased	by	2.2%	(UI	0.8%	to	&#13;
3.4%)	per	year	during	the	same	period.	&#13;
In	1990	there	were	approximately	1500	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	in	sub-Saharan	&#13;
Africa.	Following	the	trend	of	the	epidemic,	these	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths	increased	&#13;
in	number	until	2005	when	there	were	an	estimated	12	370	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	deaths,	&#13;
before	decline	to	an	estimated	4700	in	2015.	&#13;
Annexes	8,	10,	12,	14	and	16	present	the	MMR	trends,	reduction	in	MMR	between	1990	and	2015,	&#13;

&amp;#12;Country	estimates	&#13;
Annex	19	provides	information	on	MMR	trends	from	1990	to	2015	for	each	country.	Assessments	of	&#13;
national-level	progress	towards	achieving	MDG	5A13	 (see	categories	explained	in	Box	5)	were	&#13;
conducted	for	those	95	countries	that	started	the	evaluation	period	in	1990	with	the	highest	MMR	&#13;
(100	or	greater).	This	cut-off	was	chosen	in	order	to	focus	the	assessment	of	progress	on	those	&#13;
countries	with	the	greatest	maternal	mortality	burden,	and	due	to	the	difficulty	of	reducing	MMR	&#13;
further	in	countries	where	levels	were	already	relatively	low	in	1990.	Of	these	95	countries,	results	&#13;
strongly14	 indicate	that	58	experienced	a	decline	in	MMR	between	1990	and	2015.	For	the	remaining	&#13;
26	countries,	it	cannot	be	confidently	concluded	whether	MMR	increased	or	decreased,	however	&#13;
point-estimates	suggest	that	22	of	them	likely	experienced	a	decrease	and	4	likely	experienced	an	&#13;
increase. 	&#13;
&#13;
Point-estimates	indicate	that	nine	countries	achieved	at	least	a	75%	reduction	in	MMR	over	the	&#13;
25-year	period,	meaning	that	they	achieved	MDG	5A.	These	countries	are:	Maldives	(90%	reduction	&#13;
in	MMR),	Bhutan	(84%),	Cambodia	(84%),	Cabo	Verde	(84%),	the	Islamic	Republic	of	Iran	(80%),	&#13;
Timor-Leste	(80%),	the	Lao	Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s	Democratic	Republic	(78%),	Rwanda	(78%)	and	Mongolia	&#13;
(76%).	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
3.3	 Comparison	with	previous	maternal	mortality	estimates	&#13;
The	results	described	in	this	report	are	the	most	accurate	maternal	mortality	estimates	yet	for	all	&#13;
years	in	the	1990â&#128;&#147;2015	period.	Therefore,	these	2015	estimates	should	be	used	for	the	&#13;
interpretation	of	trends	in	MMR	from	1990	to	2015,	rather	than	extrapolating	estimates	from	&#13;
previously	published	estimates.	As	explained	in	Chapter	2,	these	estimates	were	generated	using	an	&#13;
improved	approach	that	built	directly	upon	the	methods	used	to	produce	previously	published	&#13;
estimates.	In	addition	to	the	refined	model,	updated	data	and	a	larger	overall	global	database	&#13;
informed	the	2015	estimates,	as	compared	to	those	previously	published.	Notably,	the	publication	&#13;
of	new	population-based	studies	from	the	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo,	Nigeria	and,	to	a	&#13;
lesser	extent,	Sierra	Leone	all	indicated	much	higher	MMR	than	was	previously	estimated	for	those	&#13;
counties.	Given	the	large	populations	in	the	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo	and	Nigeria,	this	has	&#13;
impacted	the	global-level	estimates.	The	updated	methodology	adds	refinements	that	allow	&#13;
country-level	data	to	drive	estimates	as	much	as	possible	(rather	than	the	covariates	GDP,	fertility	&#13;
rate	and	skilled	attendants	at	birth	coverage),	and	ensure	that	higher	quality	data	influences	&#13;
estimates	more	than	lower	quality	data.	&#13;

4.1	 Millennium	Development	Goal	(MDG)	5	outcomes	&#13;
With	the	aim	of	improving	maternal	health,	MDG	5	established	a	target	of	reducing	the	1990	global	&#13;
maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR)	by	75%	by	2015	(MDG	5A).	Assessing	country-level	progress	&#13;
towards	this	target	requires	examining	estimated	reductions,	while	also	taking	into	consideration	&#13;
the	range	of	uncertainty	around	those	estimates.	For	example,	Nigeriaâ&#128;&#153;s	estimated	MMR	reduction	&#13;
between	1990	and	2015	is	39.6%,	but	the	80%	uncertainty	interval	(UI)	for	that	point-estimate	spans	&#13;
zero	(â&#128;&#147;5%	to	56.3%),	which	implies	that	there	is	a	greater	than	10%	chance	that	no	reduction	in	&#13;
Nigeriaâ&#128;&#153;s	MMR	has	occurred.	There	is,	therefore,	not	enough	reliable	information	on	maternal	&#13;
mortality	in	Nigeria	to	conclude	with	confidence	that	the	country	has	made	any	progress	towards	&#13;
the	MDG	5A	target.	Due	to	this	need	to	consider	estimation	uncertainty	when	evaluating	progress,	&#13;
the	95	countries	with	an	MMR	above	10015	 in	1990	have	been	categorized	based	on	both	MMR	&#13;
reduction	point-estimates	and	80%	UI.	Box	5	lists	the	categories	and	describes	the	criteria	used	to	&#13;
assign	countries	to	categories.	Countries	were	placed	into	the	highest	category	for	which	they	met	&#13;
the	criteria.	&#13;

  	 The	MMR	cut-off	of	100	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births	was	chosen	in	order	to	focus	the	assessment	of	&#13;
progress	on	countries	that	started	with	a	relatively	high	level	of	maternal	mortality	in	1990,	and	due	to	the	difficulty	of	&#13;
reducing	MMR	further	in	countries	where	levels	were	already	relatively	low	(&lt;	100)	in	1990.	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                               27&#13;
&amp;#12;estimated	MMR	reduction	of	25%	or	more,	and	at	least	a	90%	chance	that	the	true	reduction	was	&#13;
above	zero.	The	fourth	and	final	category	includes	26	countries	that	have	made	no	progress;	they	&#13;
have	an	estimated	MMR	reduction	of	less	than	25%,	or	a	greater	than	10%	chance	that	no	reduction	&#13;
has	occurred	at	all.	Given	the	variability	of	maternal	mortality	reporting	methods	and	data	quality,	&#13;
these	categories	provide	the	best	possible	assessment	of	likely	performance	on	the	MDG	5A	target.	&#13;
Annex	18	displays	category	labels	for	all	95	countries.	&#13;
The	nine	countries	which	are	considered	to	have	achieved	MDG	5A	based	on	point-estimates	are:	&#13;
Bhutan,	Cambodia,	Cabo	Verde,	the	Islamic	Republic	of	Iran,	the	Lao	Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s	Democratic	Republic,	&#13;
Maldives,	Mongolia,	Rwanda	and	Timor-Leste.	Yet,	among	these	countries	there	is	substantial	&#13;
variation	in	the	level	of	certainty	of	this	achievement.	As	indicated	by	uncertainty	intervals	(only	&#13;
Cambodia	and	Maldives	have	a	greater	than	90%	likelihood	of	having	a	true	MMR	reduction	of	75%	&#13;
or	more.	For	the	other	seven,	a	10%	or	greater	chance	of	not	having	achieved	the	target	persists.	&#13;
The	consideration	of	uncertainty	regarding	rates	of	reduction	is	intended	to	demonstrate	the	need	&#13;
for	more	rigorous	data	collection.	Differences	in	the	sizes	of	UIs	are	due	to	differences	in	the	quality	&#13;
of	data	used	to	inform	estimates.	For	example,	the	Islamic	Republic	of	Iran	and	Maldives	had	&#13;
substantial	maternal	mortality	data	from	civil	registration	and	vital	statistics	(CRVS)	systems	and	&#13;
surveillance	studies	available	for	inclusion	in	the	estimation	model,	while	others,	such	as	Cabo	&#13;
Verde,	Lao	Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s	Democratic	Republic	and	Timor-Leste,	had	little	to	no	country-level	data.	&#13;
While	no	MDG	region	achieved	the	target	of	reducing	maternal	mortality	by	75%	(see	Table	4),	all	&#13;
demonstrated	substantial	progress,	particularly	after	announcement	of	the	MDGs	in	2000	â&#128;&#147;	the	&#13;
estimated	global	2000â&#128;&#147;2015	annual	reduction	rate	of	3%	was	significantly	increased	in	comparison	&#13;
to	the	1990â&#128;&#147;2000	rate	of	1.2%.	This	acceleration	of	progress	reflects	a	widespread	escalation	of	&#13;
efforts	to	reduce	maternal	mortality,	stimulated	by	MDG	5.	Maternal	mortality	has	proved	to	be	a	&#13;
valuable	indicator	both	for	tracking	development	progress	and	for	spurring	action	to	improve	&#13;
maternal	health.	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
4.2	 Looking	towards	the	future	&#13;
The	Sustainable	Development	Goals	(SDGs)	now	call	for	an	acceleration	of	current	progress	in	order	&#13;
to	achieve	a	global	MMR	of	70	maternal	deaths	per	100	000	live	births,	or	less,	by	2030,	working	&#13;
towards	a	vision	of	ending	all	preventable	maternal	mortality.	Achieving	this	global	goal	will	require	&#13;
countries	to	reduce	their	MMR	by	at	least	7.5%	each	year	between	2016	and	2030.	Based	on	their	&#13;
point-estimates	for	average	annual	reduction,	three	countries	with	an	MMR	greater	than	100	nearly	&#13;
reached	or	exceeded	this	reduction	rate	between	2000	and	2015:	Cambodia	(7.4%;	UI	5.4%	to	&#13;
9.5%),	Rwanda	(8.4%;	UI	6.5%	to	10.6%)	and	Timor-Leste	(7.8%;	UI	5.7%	to	10.2	%).	The	recent	&#13;
success	of	these	countries	in	rapidly	reducing	maternal	mortality	demonstrates	that	this	goal	is	&#13;
achievable.	 	&#13;
	&#13;
    Global	targets	for	ending	preventable	maternal	mortality	(EPMM):	By	2030,	every	country	&#13;
    should	reduce	its	maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR)	by	at	least	two	thirds	from	the	2010	&#13;
    baseline,	and	no	country	should	have	an	MMR	higher	than	140	deaths	per	100 000	live	births	&#13;
    (twice	the	global	target)	(4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      28&#13;
&amp;#12;	&#13;
While	differing	contexts	make	issuing	prescribed	reduction	strategies	impossible,	examining	the	&#13;
strategies	employed	by	successful	countries	can	illuminate	routes	that	other	countries	may	find	&#13;
useful.	However,	the	30	countries	with	the	highest	MMRs	in	2015	will	have	to	achieve	substantially	&#13;
higher	annual	rates	of	reduction	to	attain	MMRs	below	140	in	2030.	&#13;
Projections	indicate	that	accomplishing	this	target	will	result	in	over	60%	fewer	deaths	in	2030	than	&#13;
the	estimated	number	in	2015,	and	will	save	a	cumulative	2.5	million	womenâ&#128;&#153;s	lives	between	2016	&#13;
and	2030,	as	compared	to	a	situation	in	which	current	reduction	trajectories	remain	unchanged	(14).	 	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
Strategies	for	success	and	challenges	to	address	&#13;
Drivers	of	success	in	reducing	maternal	mortality	range	from	making	improvements	at	the	provider	&#13;
and	health	system	level	to	implementing	interventions	aimed	at	reducing	social	and	structural	&#13;
barriers.	Box	6	describes	several	key	strategies	used	by	countries	that	have	demonstrated	success	in	&#13;
improving	maternal	survival.	These	strategies	are	situated	within	a	recently	developed	strategic	&#13;
framework	for	policy	and	programme	planning	that	is	informed	by	the	guiding	principles	of:	&#13;
(1)	empowering	women,	girls	and	communities,	(2)	protecting	and	supporting	the	motherâ&#128;&#147;baby	&#13;
dyad,	(3)	ensuring	country	ownership,	leadership	and	supportive	legal,	technical	and	financial	&#13;
frameworks,	and	(4)	applying	a	human	rights	framework	to	ensure	that	high-quality	reproductive,	&#13;
maternal	and	newborn	health	care	is	available,	accessible	and	acceptable	to	all	who	need	it	(4).	&#13;

    Strategies driving success in reducing maternal mortality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     WHOâ&#128;&#153;s	recently	published	Strategies	towards	ending	preventable	maternal	mortality	&#13;
     (EPMM)	establishes	a	strategic	framework	that	specifies	five	objectives	(4).	Below,	for	each	&#13;
     of	these	objectives,	examples	are	presented	of	strategies	implemented	by	countries	that	&#13;
     have	made	significant	reductions	in	maternal	mortality:	&#13;
     1.	Addressing	inequities	in	access	to	and	quality	of	sexual,	reproductive,	maternal	and	&#13;
     newborn	health	care	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Ethiopia	trained	womenâ&#128;&#153;s	association	members	in	strategies	for	addressing	social	and	&#13;
       structural	barriers	to	sexual,	reproductive,	maternal	and	newborn	health,	and	also	&#13;
       trained	health	managers	on	gender	mainstreaming	in	their	areas	of	work	(25).	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Viet	Nam	developed	sexual	and	reproductive	health	services	specifically	for	adolescents	&#13;
       and	youths	(25).	&#13;
     2.	Ensuring	universal	health	coverage	for	comprehensive	sexual,	reproductive,	maternal	&#13;
     and	newborn	health	care	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Rwanda	used	a	community-based	health	insurance	scheme	to	ensure	vulnerable	&#13;
       populationsâ&#128;&#153;	access	to	maternal	and	child	health	services	(26).	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Bangladesh	expanded	access	to	maternity	services	in	new,	private-sector	health-care	&#13;
       facilities	(27).	&#13;
     3.	Addressing	all	causes	of	maternal	mortality,	reproductive	and	maternal	morbidities,	&#13;
     and	related	disabilities	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Nepal	expanded	access	to	modern	family	planning	methods,	and	increased	school	&#13;
       attendance	and	literacy	rates	among	women	and	girls	(28).	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The	Maldives	strengthened	emergency	obstetric	care,	including	basic	care	and	&#13;
       comprehensive	emergency	obstetric	care	throughout	the	countryâ&#128;&#153;s	health	system	(29).	&#13;
     4.	Strengthening	heath	systems	to	respond	to	the	needs	and	priorities	of	women	and	&#13;
     girls	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Indonesia	invested	in	the	training	of	midwives	and	the	creation	of	dedicated,	village-level	&#13;
       delivery	points	for	maternal	health	services	(30).	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Cambodia	invested	in	transport	infrastructure	and	construction	of	health-care	facilities	&#13;
       staffed	with	an	expanded	cadre	of	trained	midwives	throughout	the	country,	including	&#13;
       maternity	waiting	houses	and	extended	delivery	rooms	(31).	&#13;
     5.	Ensuring	accountability	to	improve	quality	of	care	and	equity	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Mongolia	introduced	procedures	at	the	facility,	provincial	and	ministerial	levels	to	ensure	&#13;
       maternal	deaths	were	reported	within	a	24-hour	period	and	transmitted	to	the	Ministry	&#13;
       of	Health	for	review	(32).	&#13;
     â&#128;¢ India	developed	guidelines	for	maternal	death	audits	and	near-miss	analyses	(25).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
Examining	countries	that	experienced	little	to	no	reduction	in	maternal	mortality	since	1990	reveals	&#13;
several	prevalent	factors	that	impede	progress.	Among	the	27	countries	categorized	as	likely	having	&#13;
made	â&#128;&#156;no	progressâ&#128;&#157;,	23	are	particularly	impacted	by	the	HIV	epidemic.	Despite	the	recent	positive	&#13;
influence	of	antiretroviral	medications	on	AIDS-related	indirect	maternal	mortality,	overall	the	&#13;
epidemic	poses	immense	challenges	to	maternal	mortality	reduction	due	to	the	strain	it	places	on	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      30&#13;
&amp;#12;health	systems	and	infrastructure,	in	addition	to	its	direct	health	impacts.	Emergent	humanitarian	&#13;
settings	and	situations	of	conflict,	post-conflict	and	disaster	also	significantly	hinder	progress.	&#13;
Indeed,	76%	of	high	maternal	mortality	countries	(those	with	MMR	â&#137;¥	300)	are	defined	as	fragile	&#13;
states	(33).	In	such	situations,	the	breakdown	of	health	systems	can	cause	a	dramatic	rise	in	deaths	&#13;
due	to	complications	that	would	be	easily	treatable	under	stable	conditions.	At	the	peak	of	the	&#13;
2014â&#128;&#147;2015	Ebola	virus	disease	outbreak	in	Liberia,	for	example,	maternal	health	service	utilization	&#13;
dropped	precipitously	and	common	obstetric	complications	went	untreated	out	of	fear	of	disease	&#13;
transmission	(34).	Compounding	the	tragedy	of	lives	lost	in	crisis	settings,	many	of	these	deaths	go	&#13;
unrecorded.	Settings	where	the	needs	are	greatest	are	also	those	with	the	least	evidence	and	&#13;
analysis.	In	countries	designated	as	fragile	states,	the	estimated	lifetime	risk	of	maternal	mortality	&#13;
is	1	in	54.	&#13;
Many	of	the	most	vulnerable	populations	are	not	represented	in	the	current	global	data.	Moreover,	&#13;
even	within	countries	with	good	overall	progress	indicators,	the	optimistic	numbers	often	mask	&#13;
extreme	disparities.	Australia,	for	example,	determined	through	a	specialized	study	that	the	MMR	&#13;
among	Aboriginal	and	Torres	Strait	Islander	women	was	over	twice	that	of	non-indigenous	women.	&#13;
Marginalized	subpopulations	often	lack	representation	in	the	data,	and	disparities	may	not	be	&#13;
evident	without	disaggregating	data.	This	lack	of	accurate	information	makes	it	nearly	impossible	&#13;
to	determine	how	to	best	address	the	maternal	health	needs	among	the	most	vulnerable.	&#13;
An	emerging	challenge	is	increasing	late	maternal	mortality,	a	phenomenon	referred	to	as	part	of	&#13;
the	â&#128;&#156;obstetric	transitionâ&#128;&#157;	(35).	Late	maternal	mortality	refers	to	maternal	deaths	that	occur	more	&#13;
than	42	days	but	less	than	one	year	after	termination	of	pregnancy.	As	health	systems	improve	and	&#13;
are	better	able	to	manage	immediate	childbirth	complications,	deaths	within	the	first	48	hours	of	&#13;
delivery	may	be	averted,	but	the	proportion	of	morbidity	and	mortality	caused	by	late	maternal	&#13;
sequelae	or	late	maternal	complications	can	also	increase.	This	trend	has	been	observed	in	several	&#13;
countries,	such	as	Mexico	where	late	maternal	deaths	account	for	up	to	15%	of	overall	maternal	&#13;
mortality	(36).	Further	analyses	of	this	subset	of	deaths	is	warranted.	Monitoring	all	maternal	&#13;
deaths	thus	proves	increasingly	important	for	ensuring	accurate	documentation	to	detect	shifting	&#13;
dynamics	in	maternal	health.	&#13;
&#13;
Need	for	improved	measurement	and	data	&#13;
Impressive	efforts	to	establish	and	improve	CRVS	systems	or	implement	alternative	methods	of	&#13;
rigorously	recording	maternal	deaths	have	been	made	in	recent	years.	Box	7	provides	examples	of	&#13;
several	methods	countries	are	using	to	dramatically	improve	data	collection.	The	high-quality	data	&#13;
generated	even	prompted	the	use	for	this	report	of	a	refined	estimation	methodology,	one	that	&#13;
fully	utilizes	country-level	data	to	produce	a	more	accurate	and	realistic	picture	of	global	maternal	&#13;
mortality	trends	than	ever	before.	&#13;

&amp;#12;	&#13;
Box 7&#13;
Tools for improving data collection&#13;
Confidential	Enquiry	into	Maternal	Deaths	(CEMD)	&#13;
Within	established	civil	registration	and	vital	statistics	(CRVS)	systems,	CEMD	facilitates	investigation	&#13;
of	and	correction	for	underreporting	of	maternal	deaths	due	to	misclassification.	Developed	in	&#13;
England	and	Wales	and	conducted	continuously	there	since	1952	(37),	CEMD	involves	having	&#13;
multiple	experts	review	all	potential	maternal	mortality	cases	in	detail,	assessing	the	accuracy	of	&#13;
classifications	applied	as	well	as	examining	the	circumstances	of	the	death.	It	thus	also	helps	to	&#13;
identify	areas	for	action	to	prevent	future	deaths.	Kazakhstan	and	South	Africa	both	recently	&#13;
conducted	CEMD	studies,	identifying	29%	and	40%	more	maternal	deaths,	respectively,	than	were	&#13;
initially	recorded	in	the	CRVS	system.	&#13;
Maternal	Death	Surveillance	and	Response	(MDSR)	&#13;
At	the	health-care	facility	level,	MDSR	systems	promote	a	continuous	action	cycle	for	monitoring	of	&#13;
maternal	deaths,	identifying	trends	in	and	causes	of	maternal	mortality,	and	acting	to	prevent	future	&#13;
deaths	(38).	Information	generated	by	MDSR	can	be	communicated	upwards	from	facilities,	to	be	&#13;
aggregated	at	the	regional	and	national	levels.	Where	national	CRVS	systems	have	not	yet	been	&#13;
established,	MDSR	serves	as	a	building	block	for	a	comprehensive,	national-level	data	collection	&#13;
system.	Countries	that	have	recently	established,	strengthened	or	expanded	MDSR	systems	include	&#13;
Cameroon,	the	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo,	India,	Morocco,	Nigeria	and	Togo	(25).	&#13;
Digital	innovations	&#13;
Given	the	high	percentage	of	births	and	maternal	deaths	that	occur	outside	of	health-care	facilities,	&#13;
there	is	a	critical	need	to	obtain	and	communicate	vital	events	data	from	the	community	level.	Digital	&#13;
solutions	delivered	via	mobile	devices	(mHealth	tools)	that	connect	frontline	health	workers	to	&#13;
national	health	systems	can	simultaneously	improve	health-care	service	delivery,	strengthen	&#13;
accountability,	and	generate	real-time	data	(39).	A	growing	proportion	of	these	digital	tools	focus	on	&#13;
registration	of	pregnancies	and	notification	of	births	and	deaths,	linking	information	directly	to	&#13;
facility-,	district-	and	national-level	health	management	and	vital	events	statistical	systems	(40).	One	&#13;
example	is	the	Open	Smart	Register	Platform,	or	OpenSRP	(41).	Pilot	tests	of	OpenSRP	and	similar	&#13;
digital	tools	are	under	way	in	Bangladesh,	India,	Indonesia,	Pakistan	and	South	Africa.	&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
Yet,	while	the	estimates	presented	in	this	report	provide	valuable	policy	and	programme	planning	&#13;
guidance,	they	cannot	change	the	fact	that	many	women	who	die	from	maternal	causes	still	go	&#13;
uncounted.	Taking	effective	action	to	prevent	future	maternal	deaths	requires	knowing	who	has	&#13;
died	and	why	they	died.	Respect	for	human	rights	and	human	life	necessitates	improved	&#13;
record-keeping	so	that	all	births,	deaths	and	causes	of	death	are	officially	accounted	for.	For	these	&#13;
reasons,	improving	metrics,	measurement	systems	and	data	quality	is	a	crucial	cross-cutting	action	&#13;
for	all	strategies	aimed	at	ensuring	maternal	survival	(4).	&#13;
The	broad	uncertainty	intervals	associated	with	the	estimates	presented	throughout	this	report	&#13;
directly	reflect	the	critical	need	for	better	data	on	maternal	mortality.	Governments	are	called	upon	&#13;
to	establish	well	functioning	CRVS	systems	with	accurate	attribution	of	cause	of	death.	&#13;
Improvements	in	measurement	must	be	driven	by	action	at	the	country	level,	with	governments	&#13;
creating	systems	to	capture	data	specific	to	their	information	needs;	systems	that	must	also	meet	&#13;
the	standards	required	for	international	comparability.	Globally,	standardized	methods	for	&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       32&#13;
&amp;#12;preventing	underreporting	should	be	established	to	enhance	international	comparability.	 	&#13;
Finally,	data	that	can	be	disaggregated	to	examine	trends	and	measure	the	mortality	burden	within	&#13;
the	most	vulnerable	and	most	frequently	overlooked	populations	are	critical	for	implementing	&#13;
strategies	to	address	inequities	and	accelerate	progress	towards	maternal	mortality	reduction.	&#13;
Populations	requiring	particular	attention	include	refugees	and	groups	that	face	discrimination	or	&#13;
stigma.	Better	data	on	the	maternal	mortality	burden	among	adolescent	girls	is	also	needed;	&#13;
maternal	causes	rank	second	among	causes	of	death	for	girls	aged	15â&#128;&#147;19	(42).	Several	countries,	&#13;
particularly	those	in	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean,	and	in	South-East	Asia,	have	already	begun	&#13;
reporting	data	for	women	and	girls	outside	the	standard	15â&#128;&#147;49	year	age	interval,	documenting	the	&#13;
disturbing	fact	that	maternal	deaths	are	occurring	among	girls	even	younger	than	15.	&#13;
	&#13;
&#13;
4.3	 A	call	to	action	&#13;
The	announcement	of	MDG	5	in	2000	attracted	intense	scrutiny	of	the	shamefully	high	numbers	of	&#13;
women	dying	from	maternal	causes.	It	initiated	an	unprecedented	and	ongoing	global	conversation	&#13;
about	how	maternal	mortality	should	be	measured,	what	strategies	could	be	employed	to	save	&#13;
lives,	and	how	the	progress	of	these	reduction	efforts	would	be	assessed.	Accurate	measurement	of	&#13;
maternal	mortality	levels	remains	an	immense	challenge,	but	the	overall	message	is	clear:	hundreds	&#13;
of	thousands	of	women	are	still	dying	during	childbirth	or	from	pregnancy-related	causes	each	year.	&#13;
The	goal	of	ending	preventable	maternal	mortality	is	a	call	to	action	across	all	regions	of	the	globe,	&#13;
developed	and	developing,	including	areas	where	substantial	progress	has	already	been	made.	&#13;
Among	countries	where	maternal	death	counts	remain	high,	the	challenge	is	clear.	Efforts	to	save	&#13;
lives	must	be	accelerated	and	must	also	be	paired	with	country-driven	efforts	to	accurately	count	&#13;
lives	and	record	deaths.	Among	those	countries	with	low	overall	maternal	mortality	indicators,	the	&#13;
next	challenge	is	measuring	and	amending	inequities	among	subpopulations.	Across	varying	&#13;
settings,	strategies	must	be	both	context-specific	and	thoroughly	grounded	in	a	human	rights	&#13;
approach.	With	rapid	acceleration	of	the	efforts	and	progress	catalysed	by	MDG	5,	ending	&#13;
preventable	maternal	mortality	on	a	global	level	can	be	achieved	by	2030.	 	&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex 2. Measuring maternal mortality&#13;
Concepts and definitions&#13;
In the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision&#13;
(ICD-10),1 WHO defines maternal death as:&#13;
The death of a woman while pregnant, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of&#13;
the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy&#13;
or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental&#13;
causes.&#13;
This definition allows identification of maternal deaths, based on their causes, as either direct or&#13;
indirect. Direct maternal deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant&#13;
state (i.e. pregnancy, delivery and postpartum), interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or a&#13;
chain of events resulting from any of the above. Deaths due to, for example, obstetric&#13;
haemorrhage or hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, or those due to complications of&#13;
anaesthesia or caesarean section are classified as direct maternal deaths. Indirect maternal deaths&#13;
are those resulting from previously existing diseases, or from diseases that developed during&#13;
pregnancy and that were not due to direct obstetric causes but aggravated by physiological&#13;
effects of pregnancy. For example, deaths due to aggravation of an existing cardiac or renal&#13;
disease are considered indirect maternal deaths.&#13;
The concept of death during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium is included in the ICD-10&#13;
and is defined as any death temporal to pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum period, even if it&#13;
is due to accidental or incidental causes (this was formerly referred to as â&#128;&#156;pregnancy-related&#13;
deathâ&#128;&#157;, see Box 1). This alternative definition allows measurement of deaths that are related to&#13;
pregnancy, even though they do not strictly conform to the standard â&#128;&#156;maternal deathâ&#128;&#157; concept, in&#13;
settings where accurate information about causes of death based on medical certificates is&#13;
unavailable.&#13;
For instance, in population-based surveys, respondents provide information on the pregnancy&#13;
status of a reproductive-aged sibling at the time of death, but no further information is elicited on&#13;
the cause of death. These surveys â&#128;&#147; for example, the Demographic and Health Surveys and&#13;
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys â&#128;&#147; therefore, usually provide measures of pregnancy-related&#13;
deaths rather than maternal deaths.&#13;
Further, complications of pregnancy or childbirth can lead to death beyond the six weeks&#13;
postpartum period, and the increased availability of modern life-sustaining procedures and&#13;
technologies enables more women to survive adverse outcomes of pregnancy and delivery, and to&#13;
delay death beyond 42 days postpartum. Despite being caused by pregnancy-related events,&#13;
these deaths do not count as maternal deaths in routine civil registration systems. Specific codes&#13;
for â&#128;&#156;late maternal deathsâ&#128;&#157; are included in the ICD-10 (O96 and O97) to capture delayed maternal&#13;
deaths occurring between six weeks and one year postpartum (see Box A2.1). Some countries,&#13;
particularly those with more developed civil registration systems, use this definition.&#13;

    Definitions related to maternal death in ICD-10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Maternal death&#13;
             The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of&#13;
             pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause&#13;
             related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or&#13;
             indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Pregnancy-related death&#13;
             The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of&#13;
             pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Late maternal death&#13;
             The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days,&#13;
             but less than one year after termination of pregnancy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coding of maternal deaths&#13;
Despite the standard definitions noted above, accurate identification of the causes of maternal&#13;
deaths is not always possible. It can be a challenge for medical certifiers to correctly attribute&#13;
cause of death to direct or indirect maternal causes, or to accidental or incidental events,&#13;
particularly in settings where most deliveries occur at home. While several countries apply the ICD-&#13;
10 in civil registration systems, the identification and classification of causes of death during&#13;
pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium remain inconsistent across countries.&#13;
With the publication of the ICD-10, WHO recommended adding a checkbox on the death&#13;
certificate for recording a womanâ&#128;&#153;s pregnancy status at the time of death.2 This was to help&#13;
identify indirect maternal deaths, but it has not been implemented in many countries. For&#13;
countries using ICD-10 coding for registered deaths, all deaths coded to the maternal chapter (O&#13;
codes) and maternal tetanus (A34) are counted as maternal deaths.&#13;
In 2012, WHO published Application of ICD-10 to deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the&#13;
puerperium: ICD maternal mortality (ICD-MM) to guide countries to reduce errors in coding&#13;
maternal deaths and to improve the attribution of cause of maternal death.3 The ICD-MM is to be&#13;
used together with the three ICD-10 volumes. For example, the ICD-MM clarifies that the coding of&#13;
maternal deaths among HIV-positive women may be due to one of the following.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢                            Obstetric causes: Such as haemorrhage or hypertensive disorders in pregnancy â&#128;&#147; these should&#13;
                             be identified as direct maternal deaths.&#13;
â&#128;¢                            The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy: In these cases,&#13;
                             there is an aggravating effect of pregnancy on HIV and the interaction between pregnancy&#13;

                             deaths. In this report, they are referred to as â&#128;&#156;AIDS-related indirect maternal deathsâ&#128;&#157;, and in the&#13;
                             ICD those deaths are coded to O98.7 and categorized in Group 7 (non-obstetric complications)&#13;
                             in the ICD-MM.&#13;
â&#128;¢                            Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS): In these cases, the womanâ&#128;&#153;s pregnancy status is&#13;
                             incidental to the course of her HIV infection and her death is a result of an HIV complication, as&#13;
                             described by ICD-10 codes B20â&#128;&#147;24. These are not considered maternal deaths. Thus, proper&#13;
                             reporting of the mutual influence of HIV or AIDS and pregnancy in Part 1 of the death&#13;
                             certificate will facilitate the coding and identification of these deaths.&#13;
&#13;
Measures of maternal mortality&#13;
The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:&#13;
(i) The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.&#13;
(ii) The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of&#13;
reproductive age).&#13;
The MMR is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live&#13;
births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of&#13;
live births and essentially captures (i) above.&#13;
By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is defined as the number of maternal deaths in a&#13;
population divided by the number of women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years (or woman-years lived at ages 15â&#128;&#147;&#13;
49 years). The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth&#13;
(live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the&#13;
MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the&#13;
population (see Box A2). An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of maternal&#13;
deaths among deaths of women of reproductive age (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal&#13;
deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years.&#13;

Approaches for measuring maternal mortality&#13;
Ideally, civil registration systems with good attribution of cause of death provide accurate data on&#13;
the level of maternal mortality and the causes of maternal deaths. In countries with incomplete&#13;
civil registration systems, it is difficult to accurately measure levels of maternal mortality. First, it is&#13;
challenging to identify maternal deaths precisely, as the deaths of women of reproductive age&#13;
might not be recorded at all. Second, even if such deaths were recorded, the pregnancy status or&#13;
cause of death may not have been known and the deaths would therefore not have been reported&#13;
as maternal deaths. Third, in most developing-country settings where medical certification of&#13;
cause of death does not exist, accurate attribution of a female death as a maternal death is&#13;
difficult.&#13;
Even in developed countries where routine registration of deaths is in place, maternal deaths may&#13;
be underreported due to misclassification of ICD-10 coding, and identification of the true numbers&#13;
of maternal deaths may require additional special investigations into the causes of death. A&#13;
specific example of such an investigation is the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD),&#13;
a system established in England and Wales in 1928.5,6,7 The most recent report of the CEMD (for&#13;
2009â&#128;&#147;2011) identified 79% more maternal deaths than were reported in the routine civil&#13;
registration system.8 Other studies on the accuracy of the number of maternal deaths reported in&#13;
civil registration systems have shown that the true number of maternal deaths could be twice as&#13;
high as indicated by routine reports, or even more.9,10 Annex 6 summarizes the results of a&#13;

These studies are diverse in terms of the definition of maternal mortality used, the sources&#13;
considered (death certificates, other vital event certificates, medical records, questionnaires or&#13;
autopsy reports) and the way maternal deaths are identified (record linkage or assessment from&#13;
experts). In addition, the system of reporting causes of death to a civil registry differs from one&#13;
country to another, depending on the death certificate forms, the type of certifiers and the coding&#13;
practice. These studies have estimated underreporting of maternal mortality due to&#13;
misclassification in death registration data, ranging from 0.85 to 5.0, with a median value of 1.5 (i.e.&#13;
a misclassification rate of 50%).&#13;
Underreporting of maternal deaths was more common among:&#13;
â&#128;¢                            early pregnancy deaths, including those not linked to a reportable birth outcome;&#13;
â&#128;¢                            deaths in the later postpartum period (these were less likely to be reported than early&#13;
                             postpartum deaths);&#13;
â&#128;¢                            deaths at extremes of maternal age (youngest and oldest);&#13;
â&#128;¢                            miscoding by the ICD-9 or ICD-10, most often seen in cases of deaths caused by:&#13;
                                 o cerebrovascular diseases;&#13;
                                 o cardiovascular diseases.&#13;
Potential reasons cited for underreporting and/or misclassification include:&#13;
â&#128;¢                            inadequate understanding of the ICD rules (either ICD-9 or ICD-10);&#13;
â&#128;¢                            death certificates completed without mention of pregnancy status;&#13;
â&#128;¢                            desire to avoid litigation;&#13;
â&#128;¢                            desire to suppress information (especially as related to abortion deaths).&#13;

             Civil registration system&#13;
&#13;
             This approach involves routine registration of births and deaths. Ideally, maternal mortality&#13;
             statistics should be obtained through civil registration data. However, even where coverage is&#13;
             complete and the causes of all deaths are identified based on standard medical certificates, in&#13;
             the absence of active case finding, maternal deaths may be missed or misclassified; and&#13;
             therefore confidential enquiries are used to identify the extent of misclassification and&#13;
             underreporting.&#13;

             (MICS) use the direct â&#128;&#156;sisterhoodâ&#128;&#157; method using household survey data. This method obtains&#13;
             information by interviewing a representative sample of respondents about the survival of all their&#13;
             siblings (to determine the age of all siblings, how many are alive, how many are dead, age at&#13;
             death and year of death of those dead, and among sisters who reached reproductive age, how&#13;
             many died during pregnancy, delivery or within two months of pregnancy). This approach has the&#13;
             following limitations.&#13;

             Census&#13;
&#13;
             A national census, with the addition of a limited number of questions, could produce estimates of&#13;
             maternal mortality. This approach eliminates sampling errors (because all women are covered)&#13;
             and hence allows a more detailed breakdown of the results, including trend analysis, geographic&#13;
             subdivisions and social strata.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             This approach allows identification of deaths in the household in a relatively short reference&#13;
                                           period (1â&#128;&#147;2 years), thereby providing recent maternal mortality estimates, but is conducted at&#13;
                                           10-year intervals and therefore limits monitoring of maternal mortality.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             It identifies pregnancy-related deaths (not maternal deaths); however, if combined with&#13;
                                           verbal autopsy, maternal deaths could be identified.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             Training of enumerators is crucial, since census activities collect information on a range of&#13;
                                           other topics unrelated to maternal deaths.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             Results must be adjusted for characteristics such as completeness of death and birth&#13;
                                           statistics and population structures, in order to arrive at reliable estimates.&#13;

             Reproductive-age mortality studies (RAMOS)&#13;
&#13;
             This approach involves identifying and investigating the causes of all deaths of women of&#13;
             reproductive age in a defined area or population, by using multiple sources of data (e.g.&#13;
             interviews of family members, civil registrations, health-care facility records, burial records,&#13;
             traditional birth attendants), and has the following characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             Multiple and diverse sources of information must be used to identify deaths of women of&#13;
                                           reproductive age; no single source identifies all the deaths.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             Interviews with household members and health-care providers and reviews of facility records&#13;
                                           are used to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             If properly conducted, this approach provides a fairly complete estimation of maternal&#13;
                                           mortality (in the absence of reliable routine registration systems) and could provide&#13;
                                           subnational MMRs. However, inadequate identification of all deaths of reproductive-aged&#13;
                                           women results in underestimation of maternal mortality levels.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢                             This approach can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive to undertake â&#128;&#147;&#13;

&#13;
             This approach is used to assign cause of death through interviews with family or community&#13;

             conducted as part of a demographic surveillance system maintained by research institutions that&#13;
             collect records of births and deaths periodically among small populations (typically in a district).&#13;
             This approach may also be combined with household surveys or censuses. In special versions,&#13;
             and in combination with software that helps to identify the diagnosis, verbal autopsy is suitable&#13;
             for routine use as an inexpensive method in populations where no other method of assessing the&#13;

&amp;#12;Annex 6. Estimation of AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths&#13;
In this estimation process, the full model has two parts, the first part to separately estimate&#13;
maternal deaths not related to AIDS (discussed in section 2.4 of the main report) and the second&#13;
part to estimate AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths. AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths refer&#13;
to HIV-positive women who have died because of the aggravating effect of pregnancy on HIV;&#13;
where the interaction between pregnancy and HIV becomes the underlying cause of death, these&#13;
are counted as indirect maternal deaths. It is important to note that direct maternal deaths among&#13;
HIV-positive women are not estimated separately but are rather included within the first part of&#13;
the model.&#13;
Thus, the final PM estimates are the result of adding the results of this two-part model: the&#13;
estimated number of non-AIDS-related maternal deaths and the estimated number of AIDS-&#13;
related indirect maternal deaths:&#13;
                                                           PM = (1 â&#128;&#147; a)PMna + aPMa                                                                                                                                                                  (A6.1)&#13;
where PMna is the proportion of non-AIDS-related maternal deaths among all non-AIDS-related&#13;
deaths (women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years); PMa is the proportion of AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths&#13;
among all AIDS-related deaths (women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years); and a is the proportion of AIDS-related&#13;
deaths among all deaths (women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years).&#13;
This appendix describes the second part of the two-part model, that is, the estimation of AIDS-&#13;
related indirect maternal deaths, PMa. The sources of data for estimating the fraction of AIDS-&#13;
related indirect maternal deaths are the UNAIDS 2013 estimates of AIDS-related deaths25 and the&#13;
total number of deaths estimated by WHO from its life tables. The approach used to estimate the&#13;
proportion of AIDS-related deaths that qualify as indirect maternal deaths, PMa, is the product of&#13;
two quantities:&#13;
                                                           PMa = Ï&#133;u                                                                                                                                                                                 (A6.2)&#13;
where Ï&#133; is the proportion of AIDS deaths in women aged 15â&#128;&#147;49 years that occur during pregnancy&#13;
or the childbirth period, computed as follows:&#13;
                                                                                              ckGFR&#13;
                                                           Ï&#133;=                                                                                                                                                                                       (A6.3)&#13;
                                                                                         1 + c(k â&#136;&#146; 1)GFR&#13;
u is the fraction of AIDS-related deaths among pregnant women that qualify as maternal because&#13;
of some causal relationship with the pregnancy, delivery or postpartum period; GFR is the general&#13;
fertility rate; c is the average woman-years lived in the maternal risk period per live birth (set equal&#13;
to 1 year, including the 9 month gestation, plus 42 days postpartum, and an additional 1.5 months&#13;
to account for pregnancies not ending in a live birth); k Â is the relative risk of dying from AIDS for a&#13;
pregnant versus non-pregnant woman.&#13;
In the 2013 estimates, updated values for k and u were used, in light of new data from the network&#13;
for Analyzing Longitudinal Population-based HIV/AIDS data on Africa (ALPHA).26 Based on the&#13;

   According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), AIDS-related deaths (including AIDS-related&#13;
indirect maternal deaths) include the estimated number of deaths related to HIV infection, including deaths that occur&#13;
before reaching the clinical stage classified as AIDS.&#13;

            Trends in maternal mortality : 1990 to 2015
            - estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group, and
            the United Nations population division
        </repnme>

            In 2000, the United Nations (UN) Member
            States pledged to work towards a series of Millennium
            Development Goals (MDGs), including the target of a
            three-quarters reduction in the 1990 maternal mortality
            ratio (MMR; maternal deaths per 100 000 live births), to be
            achieved by 2015. This target (MDG 5A) and that of achieving
            universal access to reproductive health (MDG 5B) together
            formed the two targets for MDG 5: Improve maternal health.
            In the five years counting down to the conclusion of the
            MDGs, a number of initiatives were established to galvanize
            efforts towards reducing maternal mortality. These included
            the UN Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and
            Children’s Health, which mobilized efforts towards achieving
            MDG 4 (Improve child health) as well as MDG 5, and the
            high-level Commission on Information and Accountability
            (COIA), which promoted “global reporting, oversight, and
            accountability on women’s and children’s health”. Now,
            building on the momentum generated by MDG 5, the Sustainable
            Development Goals (SDGs) establish a transformative new
            agenda for maternal health towards ending preventable
            maternal mortality; target 3.1 of SDG 3 is to reduce the
            global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 live births by 2030.
