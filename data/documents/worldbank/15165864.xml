INTRODUCTION&#13;
What does it take to bring about sustainable sanitation behavior                         â&#128;¢ QUICKLY Open Defecation Free (ODF) communities rep-&#13;

opment Goal target for rural sanitation seems well beyond reach.                           periodic rechecks.&#13;
Meanwhile economic losses from poor sanitation and hygiene are                           â&#128;¢ Sanitation behavior change is difficult to ignite in river-&#13;
costing Indonesia US$6.3 billion or 2.3 percent of its GDP per year.2&#13;

Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and sanitation marketing.                            guarantee ODF outcomes.&#13;
                                                                                         â&#128;¢ Provided CLTS triggering is of sufficient quality, ODF&#13;
The subsidy-free CLTS4 approach is one that Indonesia field-trialed                        achievement and sustainability are hastened by:&#13;
in 2005 with such positive results that by mid-2006, the Ministry of&#13;

Health had changed ongoing national water and sanitation project&#13;
strategies mid-stream, making CLTS the principal vehicle for scal-                         leadership in the change process, b) local availability&#13;

Vietnam and some African countries, subsidy-free, market-based                             non-poor consumers, c) absence of externally provided&#13;
sanitation programs were showing encouraging results in scaling up&#13;

access to sanitation in poor rural populations. In Indonesia, sanita-&#13;

            Factors associated with achieving and

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The study goals were, first, to identify
            the factors that influence the achievement and
            sustainability of collective behavior change by communities
            to become Open Defecation Free (ODF); and second, to
            understand what these findings might imply for improving
            program implementation effectiveness at scale. All of the
            project districts were approached with the opportunity to
            participate, with 20 out of the 29 districts electing to
            participate. At project inception, East Java was home to 20
            percent of the countries poor and had a total population of
            37.4 million (exceeding the population of mid-size country
            such as Poland or Algeria), of whom 32.35 million lived in
            rural areas. Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and all
            stakeholders agreed to study this issue through action
            research to bring the voices and perspectives of project
            communities into the search for answers.
