Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:            Republic of Bolivia.&#13;
Benificiary:         Small rural communities throughout the country.&#13;
Executing&#13;
agency:              The National Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DINASBA), the main&#13;
institution for the water sector, will be responsible for overall project&#13;
implementation. DINASBA will also manage the institutional component of the&#13;
project. The Social Investment Fund (SIF) will manage the investment component&#13;
of the project.&#13;
Amount:              SDR 13.4 million (US$20 million equivalent) including up to SDR 1.13 million to&#13;
be financed retroactively.&#13;
Terms:               Standard International Development Association (IDA) terms, with 40 years'&#13;
maturity and 10 years' grace.&#13;
Service charge:      0.75 percent, less any waiver.&#13;
Commitmentfee:      0.50 percent on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less&#13;
any waiver.&#13;
Financing plan:      See para. 37.&#13;
Poverty category:    Since poverty alleviation is the main goal of the project, it targets the poorest rural&#13;
Bolivians, those in the highlands of the Sierra and Andean Valles, where the&#13;
population is entirely indigeneous totaling baout 3.7 million (either Aymara or&#13;
Quechua). The project will focus on the mobilization of communities involved and&#13;
on the active particiaption of women in the planning, execution, and operation of&#13;
water and sanitation facilities in all departments of the country.&#13;
Rate of return:     The internal economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be 13 percent.&#13;

I. Background&#13;
A.     Socioeconomic setting&#13;
1.     Bolivia's poor have borne the burden of the economic austerity programs of the past nine years.&#13;
The economic growth of the past five years, with per capita income increasing by one percent a year, has&#13;
not reduced poverty levels-more than 70 percent of the population still lives below the poverty line.&#13;
Despite the economic reforms made since the adoption of a new constitution in 1985, the country remains&#13;
one of the poorest in Latin America. Inequalities persist within the overall population and between urban&#13;
and rural dwellers. Health, nutrition, literacy, and water and sanitation indicators, among others, are still&#13;
very low. A recent report from the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development found&#13;
that 97 percent of the rural population-more than 3 million people-is living below the poverty line.&#13;
2.     The current administration supports the sound macroeconomic policies initiated by previous&#13;
administrations to accelerate growth and to reduce poverty, but it recognizes that high growth will not&#13;
reduce poverty unless its benefits are distributed equitably. Reforms were introduced in April 1994 to&#13;
achieve short-term improvements in the living standards of the poor, particularly in rural areas. The&#13;
Popular Participation Law is changing dramatically the allocation of resources among municipalities-an&#13;
unprecedented step toward more equitable and efficient use of fiscal resources.&#13;
3.     But the economy remains fragile. In 1994 the fiscal deficit-at 3.2 percent of gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP)-was significantly lower than in 1993. Yet, the external position is not strong, with the&#13;
trade balance recording a large deficit in 1994-the twelve-month current account deficit was 10 percent of&#13;
GDP at the end of 1994. The economy is also vulnerable to exogenous factors. Adverse changes in&#13;
international commodity prices and external aid had a severe impact on the economy, and this impact is felt&#13;
mostly among the poor, particularly in rural areas. Economic hardships and widespread poverty continue to&#13;
induce urbanization. Population growth in rural Bolivia has stagnated, while the urban population grows by&#13;
4 percent a year. As a consequence, the rural population comprised 41 percent of the country's total&#13;
population in 1993, from 59 percent in 1970.&#13;
B.     Legal and institutionalframework&#13;
4.     A major institutional restructuring of the water and sanitation sector was initiated in 1991. The&#13;
government removed itself from service delivery functions, previously under the Corporacion de Aguas&#13;
and the Directorate of Environmental Sanitation of the Ministry of Health, by transferring most activities&#13;
related to construction, human resources development, and service administration to the private sector and&#13;
nongovernmental organizations. In 1993 the government consolidated the responsibility for leading the&#13;
sector into the National Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DINASBA) in the National Secretariat of&#13;
Urban Affairs, under the Ministry of Human Development. At the department level, regional development&#13;
corporations, to be replaced by departmental governments as of January 1996 when the new&#13;
Decentralization Law enters into effect, created local water and sanitation units.&#13;
5.     DINASBA, created in November 1991, is the main institution for water, sewerage, and solid waste&#13;
services. Its responsibilities include prioritizing projects at the national level, preparing national plans and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
investment programs, coordinating regional and local programs, issuing and implementing governnent&#13;
financial policies, overseeing standards and norms, and promoting institutional development. DINASBA is&#13;
a weak institution and lacks the resources to formulate policies and to coordinate sector entities. It has&#13;
fourteen employees comprising two managers who are financed by the United Nations Development&#13;
Programme (UNDP) and other professionals with short-term contracts at salaries averaging US$300 to&#13;
US$400 a month. The project will support. technical assistance to strengthen DINASBA, leading to its&#13;
integration into the civil service program of the Government of Bolivia.&#13;
6.     The current administration has considerably reduced the investment financing role of the regional&#13;
development corporations, designating the provision of technical assistance to local governments through&#13;
Unidades de Saneamiento Basico (UNASBA). The corporations have been strengthening these units so&#13;
that they can implement national policies and sector strategies, formulate and prioritize plans and programs&#13;
at the department level, assist municipalities and local communities in designing and implementing&#13;
investment projects, and assist local organizations in the operations and maintenance of water and&#13;
sanitation facilities.&#13;
7.     Most government funding of water supply and sanitation programs is handled through two&#13;
financial intermediaries, the Social Investment Fund (SIF) and the National Fund of Regional Development&#13;
(NFRD). The SIF is responsible for administering government transfers to communities with fewer than&#13;
5,000 inhabitants. These transfers mainly originate from external resources and are generally in the form of&#13;
grants, consistent with the fund's mandate of promoting socioeconomic development through social&#13;
investments, including health, education, water, and sanitation. The NFRD is responsible for financing&#13;
investment projects in urban areas by providing loans to municipalities and municipal utilities, with&#13;
possible backing by the corresponding regional development corporation, or departmental government after&#13;
January 1996, when the municipalities lack creditworthiness. NFRD loans are often combined with&#13;
government matching grants for investment projects responding to specific priorities. Both funds are&#13;
supported by the International Development Agency (IDA).&#13;
8.     Bolivia launched a second-generation reform program in 1994. Capitalization and popular&#13;
participation underpin an ambitious strategy to remove the remaining structural constraints and to achieve&#13;
more rapid and equitable economic growth. These two elements represent a fundamental change in the&#13;
regulatory framework of public services, and the mandate of DINASBA and other sector entities should be&#13;
revised accordingly.&#13;
9.     A Sector Regulation Law was enacted in October 1994. This law proposes the creation of&#13;
independent sectoral regulatory institutions, under the Ministry of Economic Development, to promote the&#13;
competitiveness of key economic sectors and public utilities. The regulatory entity for water and sanitation&#13;
services, still to be created, could represent a major step toward modernizing the sector, since it will&#13;
provide a legal framework for a more efficient operation and allocation of resources, including private&#13;
sector participation. According to the law, the main responsibilities of the regulatory institutions will be to&#13;
oversee the quality of service provision, to approve service rates according to specific sector regulations, to&#13;
grant concessions for the provision of water and sanitation services, to process complaints from customers&#13;
and apply fines to utility operators, to advise the government on sector laws and decrees, and to prepare,&#13;
for executive approval, regulations, and technical norms.&#13;
10.    The Popular Participation Law (Ley 1551), passed in April 1994, to decentralize financial&#13;
resources and political power, is radically altering the powers and responsibilities of local governments. As&#13;
a result of the enactment of this law more than 200 new municipalities in rural areas were created for the&#13;
purpose of participating in the benefits of the revenue-sharing agreement provided by the law. This law also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
sets forward procedures for communities to obtain legal status as Organizaciones Territoriales de Base,&#13;
through which communities are organized according to their social and cultural heritage. Prior to the law,&#13;
there were only 100 municipalities. The law also transferred 20 percent of fiscal resources to&#13;
municipalities, to be spent according to an annual operating plan cleared by the regional development&#13;
corporations, approved by the central government, and under the supervision of Comites de Vigilancia&#13;
comprising representatives of the Organizaciones Territoriales de Base in each municipality.&#13;
11.    Nongovernmental organizations play an important role in the poor and rural areas of Bolivia.&#13;
These organizations manage about US$200 million a year from bilateral agencies and the government-a&#13;
considerable sum compared with the annual public investment budget of about US$500 million to US$600&#13;
million. About 400 nongovernmental organizations are organized in three networks: UNITAS (the National&#13;
Union for Social Work), ERBOL (Escuela Radiofonica de Bolivia), and AIPE (the Association of&#13;
Educational Institutions). These groups are coordinated by the national Coordinadora de Redes. There are&#13;
also about eighty nongovernmental organizations grouped in the Instituciones para el Desarrollo Social&#13;
(Institutions for Social Development) that are attempting to distinguish themselves from other&#13;
nongovernmental organizations by applying rigid professional standards, including external audits, and by&#13;
seeking sustainable development instead of charity.&#13;
C.     Rural water and sanitation&#13;
12.    Coverage. Water and sanitation coverage in Bolivia is low. According to the 1992 census,&#13;
coverage for the rural population is 24 percent for water and 17 percent for sanitation, compared with 81&#13;
percent for water and 63 percent for sanitation in urban areas (annex 3). Rural coverage has increased&#13;
slightly over the past decade, but it remains far below government targets and behind the rural water and&#13;
sanitation coverage of other Andean countries. In smaller communities and dispersed populations-80&#13;
percent of the rural population lives in communities with fewer than 250 inhabitants-water and sanitation&#13;
coverage has actually declined. Such communities represent more than 35 percent of the country's total&#13;
population. Even rural towns with water supply systems have poor service quality and unenforced sanitary&#13;
standards. Sewerage systems, where they exist, are unreliable, and sewage is often discharged into the&#13;
natural drainage system without any control. Most water sources, even in small, remote communities, are&#13;
highly polluted. A sample of 400 small water supply subprojects studied during project preparation found&#13;
that 85 percent had fecal contamination and required disinfection to meet Pan-American Health&#13;
Organization standards for safe human consumption (annex 5).&#13;
13.    The dismal state of water and sanitation services causes waterborne disease, the most frequently&#13;
reported illness in Bolivia. Enteric diseases are the second leading cause of death among all age groups, and&#13;
Bolivia has the second highest rate of infant mortality in Latin America-75 per 1,000 live births,&#13;
according to the 1992 census-with intestinal infections as the leading cause. In rural areas the lack of&#13;
adequate water supply facilities forces households to devote substantial time and energy to fetching water&#13;
from distant sources, which often are unfit for human consumption. This burden falls disproportionately on&#13;
women and children.&#13;
14.   Investment. The 1992-2000 National Water and Sanitation Plan gave priority to rural services and&#13;
to correcting the imbalance between water and sanitation coverage. The plan targeted public investment of&#13;
US$769 million for the eight-year period, with 70 percent coming from extemal financing. The plan also&#13;
proposed policy changes and capacity-building efforts to improve utility performance and the use of&#13;
resources. The plan wvas overly optimistic in evaluating the sector's capacity to absorb such investment,&#13;
and investments for 1992 were US$48.7 million and for 1993 US$56.4 million-consistent with historical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
investrnent patterns. The 1994 budget allocated 9 percent of public investment to water and sanitation,&#13;
about US$51 million. Of this, US$15 million went to expenditures in areas other than the departmental&#13;
capitals, including about US$10 million to rural communities with fewer than 5,000 people (annex 3).&#13;
D.     Lessons learned&#13;
15.    The rural water supply and sanitation sector has seen a multitude of projects with different policy&#13;
agendas and objectives driven by different donors and nongovernmental organizations. IDA financed water&#13;
and sanitation investments through four social investment projects, two with the now-defunct Social&#13;
Emergency Fund and two through its successor, the Social Investment Fund. Investments focused on poor,&#13;
rural and peri-urban areas. Since 1991 the UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program has&#13;
implemented a pilot project costing US$3 million to benefit about 60,000 people in the poorest&#13;
communities of the Department of Potosi. The project tested low-cost water and sanitation technologies,&#13;
developed innovative approaches to community participation, and implemented an extensive hygiene&#13;
education program. The experience gained in Potosi provides a sound basis for the proposed project, as&#13;
well as for the sustainability of future efforts (annex 2).&#13;
16.    The most important lessons learned from past projects are that:&#13;
* Communities should play a decisionmaking role over the life of the project, from planning to&#13;
operations.&#13;
* Community decisions should be based on the willingness to pay for different levels of service.&#13;
*  Even the poorest communities are willing to pay up to 30 percent of the capital investment&#13;
cost.&#13;
* Communities can be trained to administer and operate facilities with appropriate technology.&#13;
* Sustainability is improved when comununities finance and operate their facilities.&#13;
*  Rural water and sanitation projects should pay more attention to such activities as demand&#13;
generation, community mobilization, and training.&#13;
*  Training and hygiene education in the health, education and social sectors are essential to the&#13;
effective and sustained use of services.&#13;
*  Nongovernmental organizations seem to be effective in working at the grassroots level and in&#13;
most cases they have demonstrated efficiency and reliability in undertaking rural water and&#13;
sanitation programs.&#13;
*  Economic efficiency dictates that per capita investment ceilings for water supply and sewage&#13;
disposal be used as a selection criteria for individual subprojects.&#13;
*  Economies of scale can be achieved when subprojects are grouped, and when water supply and&#13;
sanitation is provided at the same time.&#13;
*  The participation of women must be actively encouraged, since they are usually the main users&#13;
of water, and to a large extent are responsible for hygiene practices within the family.&#13;
*  Technical support to operation and maintenance is required at the community, municipal, and&#13;
department levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. The Project&#13;
17.    The current project originated in 1993 when the government asked IDA to finance the rural&#13;
component of the national sector plan. Project preparation has been funded through three Project&#13;
Preparation Facility advances totaling US$1.7 million. The first advance was approved in July 1993, the&#13;
second in August 1994, and the third in July 1995. The UNDP contributed an additional US$150,000. The&#13;
staff of the project preparation team, paid for by the facility, was recruited by DINASBA in August 1993,&#13;
when project preparation activities officially started. In September 1994, sixteen nongovernmental&#13;
organizations were contracted to undertake all preparation activities at the municipal and department levels,&#13;
through a participatory process involving the authorities of local and regional water and sanitation units.&#13;
National and departmental workshops were held to ensure a collaborative process.&#13;
18.    The proposed project would be Bolivia's first large-scale, sector specific, rural water and sanitation&#13;
project. It would support the current administration's reform efforts in the areas of decentralization,&#13;
popular participation, policy fornulation, and public management. It is consistent with IDA's strategy for&#13;
Bolivia, which focuses on alleviating poverty and on improving the economic potential of marginal&#13;
populations, as stated in the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on February 8, 1994. The&#13;
government is committed to an expeditious and effective implementation of the project. IDA assistance is&#13;
sought mainly because of IDA's experience in policy formulation and project implementation in the water&#13;
and sanitation sector. Advice is particularly needed for the coordination of the numerous multilateral and&#13;
bilateral agencies operating in Bolivia.&#13;
A.     Objective&#13;
19.    The project's goal is to alleviate poverty in rural areas by enhancing productivity through improved&#13;
health conditions and a more efficient use of the time saved collecting water. Specific objectives include&#13;
increasing the coverage and sustainable use of water and sanitation services in rural communities and&#13;
muncipalities, assisting the local water and sanitation units in developing the capacity to provide technical&#13;
assistance to municipal governments and local communities, supporting the sustainability of water and&#13;
sanitation services through extensive training of community-level operators and administrators, and&#13;
strengthening the capacity of DINASBA to formulate policies, prepare technical standards, and mobilize&#13;
financial resources.&#13;
B.     Description&#13;
20.    While the project aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of Bolivia to manage and develop&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation, investment activities initially will be targeted to four departments: La&#13;
Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, and Potosi. These departments were chosen by the govermment, assisted by&#13;
the project preparation team. These departments have large rural populations-totaling 2.4 million-and&#13;
poor water supply and sanitation coverage (annex 3). Their regional development corporations have been&#13;
actively involved in rural water and sanitation programs and have been committed to financing subproject&#13;
preparation from their own budgets, and have been assisting municipal governments and local communities&#13;
in sustaining and expanding these programs. As of January 1996, the departmental governments will&#13;
assume this responsibility according to the Decentralization Law, passed by Congress in July 1995. Project&#13;
design features, summarized in annex 6, include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
*  strong community participation for improving economic efficiency and sustainability;&#13;
*  five-year municipal plans and annual operating budgets to ensure that the proposed investments are&#13;
a high priority for the community and the society;&#13;
*  low per capita grants to purgue least cost projects;&#13;
*  high financial contribution from municipalities and beneficiaries to ensure demand-driven&#13;
investments;&#13;
*  full cost recovery to attain long-term sustainability of services; and&#13;
* flexibility in project design and implementation to accommodate community demand.&#13;
21.    Focusing the first year of project implementation on a few geographic areas within each of the four&#13;
departments was critical to avoid dispersion of human and financial resources, to improve the effectiveness&#13;
of project preparation, and to ensure disbursement of funds early in the project implementation cycle. From&#13;
the second year of implementation, the project's investment activities will be expanded to other departnents&#13;
(paragraph 20), that have eligible rural water supply and sanitation projects, that are willing to finance&#13;
subproject preparation, and that can assist municipalities and communities in executing and operating the&#13;
projects (annex 12).&#13;
22.    The proposed project consists of a rural water and sanitation infrastructure program and an&#13;
institutional capacity-building program. The infrastructure component (74 percent of total project costs)&#13;
has two subcomponents. The first will provide water supply facilities-both gravity-fed and pumped-as&#13;
well as shallow wells with hand pumps and rainwater catchments. The second subcomponent involves&#13;
small-scale wastewater collection facilities, treatment and disposal systems, and latrines (annex 5).&#13;
23.    The technical assistance component (17 percent of total project costs) has three subcomponents.&#13;
The first component will finance project management to assist the institutions in charge of project&#13;
implementation. This component will provide up to 400 staff-months for project management, including&#13;
consultant services, equipment, and logistical support to DINASBA and the various departmental water&#13;
and sanitation units (UNASBA) throughout Bolivia.&#13;
24.    The second subcomponent will finance technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions and&#13;
communities in their capacity to provide safe, reliable and sustainable water and sanitation services. This&#13;
subcomponent finances capacity building activities that range from technical advice on operation and&#13;
maintenance, management issues, and financial planning to project dissemination and the promotion of&#13;
behavioural changes through hygiene and environmental education programs. It contains a number of&#13;
studies to strengthen the sector such as the design and implementation of a cost recovery study. It also will&#13;
finance the design and construction of low-cost technologies and community mobilization approaches for&#13;
specific rural water and sanitation pilot projects. In addition, this subcomponent will fund a number of&#13;
impact evaluation studies, workshops and a management information system to provide feedback so that&#13;
project implementation can be adjusted if necessary.&#13;
25.    The third subcomponent is a training program that will fund training to stakeholders and&#13;
institutions responsible for backstopping water and sanitation services. Municipalities and communities&#13;
will receive training for the administration, operation and maintenance, including tariff setting, and water&#13;
quality control. This subcomponent will also finance the training of operators and administrators in the&#13;
beneficiary communities to administer, operate and maintain water and sanitation services, including a&#13;
certification program that will test each trainee wvho has benefited from training, so as to ensure the quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
and consistency of the training. Moreover, it will finance training to professional and manufactureres&#13;
associations to strengthen the human resources that work in the rural water and sanitation sector.&#13;
26.     The project will also finance the repayment of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance, and&#13;
the pre-investment studies of the infrastructure program (8 percent of total project costs).&#13;
C.      Costs&#13;
27.     The total project cost is estimated to be US$48 million (table 1). The foreign exchange requirement&#13;
is estimated to be US$6.9 million. Costs are based on end-1994 prices and do not include specific&#13;
allowances for inflation or physical contingencies because of the progra,mmatic nature of the activities&#13;
related to all project components-only the first-year activities have been fully determined. Cost estimates&#13;
for infrastructure components are based on per capita investment for a wide variety of technology options&#13;
and service levels obtained from engineering designs and similar works in Bolivia (annex 5). Institutional&#13;
development estimates are based on the terms of reference for each subcomponent and on current&#13;
consultant fees.&#13;

D.      Economics&#13;
28.     The economic justification for this project is based on the benefits it would generate in the form of&#13;
time savings, health benefits, productivity increases and insitutional benefits. Because water no longer has&#13;
to be carried over large distances, rural populations can achieve substantial savings of time. Access to&#13;
clean water, the use of adequately designed sanitary facilities and the adoption of improved hygiene&#13;
practices will have a positive impact on health. In addition, the project will also increase rural productivity&#13;
through the use of increased consumption of water for productive purposes, such as horticulture. The&#13;
project would also foster a number of benefits that are more difficult to quantify. These benefits include&#13;
the increased reliability of water supply, improved water quality, and the greater privacy of decent sanitary&#13;
facilities. The project would also generate long-run institutional benefits as community-based&#13;
organizations and municipalities leam to operate and maintain water and sanitation infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
29.     Time savings will be substantial as drinking water does not have to be hauled over large distances.&#13;
The time savings are converted into money terns by using an hourly wage rate. However, this technique&#13;
has its weaknesses as it is often women and children hauling water, whereas wage employment may not be&#13;
readily available in the rural communities that are targeted to be the beneficiaries of this project. Therefore&#13;
the time savings associated with carrying water will be converted into an adjusted wage rate that is equal to&#13;
only 60 percent of the rural wage rate. The major health benefits that are related to adequate water&#13;
supplies and sanitation are diarrheal diseases that primarily affect children under five years old. The health&#13;
benefits include cost savings as a result of reduced mortality, a reduction of the number of cases of diarrhea&#13;
that have to be treated in hospitals and health posts, and the medical costs of diarrhea that are cured&#13;
through informal treatments, such as ORS (Oral Rehydration Salts) or similar type of treatments.&#13;
Productivity benefits arise because part of the households use the increased availability of water for&#13;
horticultural purposes. The size of the plot used for horticulture, and hence the productivity benefits it will&#13;
generate, is dependent of the technology and service level chosen. In addition, some of the insitutional&#13;
benefits have been captured as the training of the certified operators will have a positive impact on their&#13;
income generating potential.&#13;
30.     The project offers various technologies for the provision of water supply and sanitation facilities.&#13;
As a consequence, the investment and operation and maintenance costs of the various technology options&#13;
will be different. In addition, due to the different service level that is offered, the benefits will also differ&#13;
per technology option. Therefore, an economic evaluation has been made for the different technology&#13;
options. The results are summarized in table 2.&#13;

31.     All water supply options except for a pumped system with house connections in semi-dispersed&#13;
areas and spring protection without tap (or standpipe), are viable projects at the individual level (table 2).&#13;
They all generate high internal rates of return, especially the low-cost technology options handpumps.&#13;
32.     The total project consists of a large number of subprojects, both at the community and the&#13;
individual household level (annex 5). The total cost of this project amount to US$48 million (including&#13;
the institutional strengthening component). Based on the experiences of the pilot project and the SIF-&#13;
financed water and sanitation projects, a distribution of the total investment funds over the different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
technology options has been made. The project investments will be implemented over a period of six&#13;
years. The base case scenario includes the benefits of time savings, health benefits, increased&#13;
productivity and are included. The net present value of the total project is Bs.31 million, the internal&#13;
rate of return is 13 percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.19.&#13;
33.    With the proposed tariff (i.e., the tariff based on operation and maintenance cost) all options are&#13;
viable from the point of view of ability to pay. In general, households using low-cost technologies will&#13;
spend up less than 3 percent of their income on water if the full cost of investment, operation and&#13;
maintenance would be charged. However, the more sophisticated technology options (such as those with&#13;
house connections) could eat up more than 10 percent of the monthly cash income of households. It is not&#13;
recommended to introduce these technology options in poor dispersed rural communities as it is likely that&#13;
these investments are not sustainable in the long run.&#13;
E.     Financing&#13;
34.    An IDA credit equivalent to US$20 million-including Project Preparation Facility funds of&#13;
US$1.7 million-will help finance foreign and local costs amounting to 42 percent of total project costs&#13;
(table 3). IDA will finance 100 percent of the institutional component and 28 percent of the infrastructure&#13;
component. SIF will provide US$ 10 million for parallel financing the infrastructure component of the&#13;
project from a specific allocation set for rural water and sanitation investments of a US$60 million IDB&#13;
loan to SIF, approved in May 1995. The OPEC Fund will provide US$5 million to cofinance the&#13;
investment component of the project. SIF and the OPEC Fund will provide the financing of the&#13;
infrastructure component against the same conditions as that of the IDA credit.&#13;
35.    The international donors will finance 70 percent of total investment costs (i.e., direct construction&#13;
costs plus the SIF fee), which are estimated at US$ 35.7 million. Municipalities will provide 30 percent of&#13;
the investment costs, of which 5 percent will be paid to the municipalities by the communities in cash. Each&#13;
community and its municipality will enter into an agreement, that stipulates the financial terms and&#13;
conditions of their contributions to the project. This agreement between community and municipality will&#13;
include an additional commitment for in-kind contributions (such as unskilled labor, and provision of local&#13;
materials valued against the rural wage rate) by the community to the municipality, equivalent to 15&#13;
percent of investment costs. Municipalities will treat the total investment as a municipal asset. The&#13;
departmental governments will finance the preparation of subprojects; these costs will equal to about 6.5&#13;
percent of direct construction costs.&#13;
36.    Municipalfinances. Since the adoption of the Popular Participation Law in April 1994, population&#13;
size serves as the basis for the distribution of intergovernmental transfers-fondos de coparticipacion-&#13;
increasing the municipal share of national revenue from 10 to 20 percent. In most municipalities, except in&#13;
department capitals, co-participation revenue has had a dramatic impact on financial capacity. This&#13;
revenue increased the average municipal revenue from US$2,500 in 1993 to US$75,000 in 1994.&#13;
Responsibilities also increased, to include the expansion and maintenance of physical infrastructure for&#13;
education, health, irrigation, and local roads. The redistributed revenue is earmarked for public&#13;
investment-only 10 percent may be used for current expenditures. The personnel costs of operating&#13;
transferred infrastructure continue to be borne by the central government. A revenue forecast for all&#13;
mumcipalities for the 1995-98 period is included in annex 11.&#13;
37.    Departmental Governments. Under the financial policy adopted for the project, regional&#13;
development corporations, to be replaced as of January 1996 by departmental governments (paragraph&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
20), do not bear a share of the investment cost. But they will fund all pre-investment expenses, which may&#13;
amount to 6.5 percent of the construction cost. Pre-investment decisions by departmental governments and&#13;
municipal investment priorities are consistent because departmental governments require prior approval&#13;
from municipal governments to make pre-investments in their jurisdiction. Therefore, pre-investment should&#13;
be included in the five-year municipal development plan and the corresponding annual operating budget&#13;
(paragraph 10). The role of the regional development corporations, according to the Decentralization Law,&#13;
will change drastically. As of January 1996, when the law enters into effect, it will eliminate the regional&#13;
corporations, absorbing their current functions into a restructured department-level government. Pre-&#13;
investment responsibilities will then be assumed by the departmental government; similarly, the institutional&#13;
functions and personnel assigned to the UNASBAs will be transferred accordingly.&#13;

38.    Social Investment Fund. The Social Investment Fund initiated operations in June 1991. The&#13;
creation of the fund followed the elimnination of the Social Emergency Fund, created as a safety-net&#13;
institution to generate employment for the poor during the first stage of structural adjustment (1985-89).&#13;
Employment generation through the Social Emergency Fund did not achieve the fund's objectives, but an&#13;
effective institution for social spending, managed by a cadre of motivated and well-paid professionals, was&#13;
created. In 1994 SIF's investments totaled US$24.6 million, and its operating cost was US$3.5 million, or&#13;
about 14 percent of investment costs. There is room for efficiency improvements at the fund, and&#13;
productivity should be stressed. Based on negotiations between the fund and several donors-including the&#13;
Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and multilateral institutions-projections were prepared for 1995-98&#13;
assuming an increase in investments to US$45 million to US$50 million, and operating costs of about&#13;
US$4.5 million per year, which results in an operating cost of less than 10 percent of its investment costs.&#13;
F      Environment&#13;
39.    The project is classified as category "B" under IDA's environmental guidelines. The only&#13;
foreseeable adverse impact is related to increased wastewater from small sewage collection systems,&#13;
particularly in communities with populations above 2,000. Similarly, minor sewage discharges into border&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rivers are envisaged as potential adverse impacts. In such cases a simplified environmental impact&#13;
assessment would be conducted following procedures included in the Project Implementation Manual&#13;
(annex 14). Mitigation measures, including stabilization ponds where physically feasible and financially&#13;
viable, would be included into subprojects as a condition for financing. In such cases, investments in&#13;
wastewater disposal facilities might be treated as independent projects.&#13;
G.     Risks&#13;
40.    The project faces three main risks. The first risk relates to the speed of implementation of the&#13;
Popular Participation Law. The law, which legally recognizes and empowers local communities, was a&#13;
major reform with social and political consequences that are only now unfolding. This risk is minimized by&#13;
strengthening the institutional capacity of municipalities and communities to operate and maintain water&#13;
and sanitation services, and by fostering the participation of municipalities and communities in the&#13;
planning, design, administration, operation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation projects, a goal&#13;
that also is supported by the recently approved Rural Communities Development Project (Cr-2772-BO).&#13;
41.    The second risk concerns the institutional weakness of the project entities. In terms of the sector's&#13;
institutions, DINASBA is weak. In addition, DINASBA has not assumed its policymaking responsibility&#13;
for the sector, instead concentrating its efforts on coordinating specific programs financed by international&#13;
agencies. The regional corporations, which will be replaced by departmental governments as of January&#13;
1996, have only recently been given the responsibility of providing technical assistance to local&#13;
governments. The corporations have acted mainly as project implementing agencies and have limited&#13;
experience in program planning, coordination, and supervision. This risk is minimized by devoting&#13;
adequate resources to strengthening DINASBA and the UNASBAs; this includes establishing specific&#13;
project units within each organization, and specific credit conditionality linked to progressive incorporation&#13;
of sector institutions, particularly DINASBA, into the Public Service Law.&#13;
42.    A third risk relates to the changed role of the municipality. The Popular Participation Law has&#13;
radically altered the powers, responsibilities and fiscal resources of the local governments. The increased&#13;
authority could result in the municipalities setting their own, politically motivated, agenda with regard to&#13;
the provision of rural water and sanitation services. However, this risk is minimized because of the use of&#13;
eligibility criteria for municipalities and communities to qualify for financing, which assures that the&#13;
project has to reflect the needs and preferences, and the willingness to pay of the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
m. Project Implementation&#13;
43.    The borrower will be the Republic of Bolivia. The overall project execution will be under the&#13;
responsibility of the National Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DINASBA). The project will be&#13;
managed by a project management unit within DINASBA. The project management unit will be responsible&#13;
for overall management of the project, and will ensure compliance with the credit and project agreement&#13;
conditions.&#13;
A.     Arrangements&#13;
44.    DINASBA will be responsible for guiding, coordinating, and monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
overall project, and for managing the institutional component of the project. The Social Investment Fund&#13;
(SIF) will be responsible for managing the investment component of the project. Prior to credit&#13;
effectiveness, SIF and the Borrower shall enter into a subsidiary agreement under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. As of January 1996, the departmental governments will assume the role of the regional&#13;
development corporations and be responsible for financing pre-investment of subprojects. A project&#13;
committee comprising representatives of the National Secretary of Popular Participation, acting as&#13;
chairman, the Under Secretary of Urban Affairs, the Under Secretary of Rural Development, the Social&#13;
Investment Fund, and each departmental government will oversee implementation of the project to ensure&#13;
proper coordination of implementation strategies and to monitor project performance. Terms of reference&#13;
for this committee, satisfactory to IDA, will be included in the implementation manual (annex 14). During&#13;
negotiations it was agreed that this project committee would be established not later than September 30,&#13;
1996.&#13;
45.    Project management. The project preparation team will be transformed into a project management&#13;
unit to implement the project. This unit, responsible for overall project execution, will be composed of a&#13;
project manager, an engineer with experience in rural water supply and sanitation, a community&#13;
mobilization specialist, and an information specialist. The infrastructure component will be managed by the&#13;
Social Investment Fund according to procedures satisfactory to IDA. The institutional component will be&#13;
managed by the project management unit through an agreement with the UNDP to be entered into not later&#13;
than two months after credit effectiveness. Terms of reference for the project management unit was agreed&#13;
on before credit negotiations. The main duties of the project management unit and the project committee&#13;
should be outlined in the implementation manual (annex 14).&#13;
46.    Legal documents and institutional agreements. Legal documents include a Development Credit&#13;
Agreement between IDA and the Republic of Bolivia (represented by the Ministry of Finance). The&#13;
Government would transfer to SIF the proceeds allocated to the investment component through a subsidiary&#13;
agreement. A model for the institutional agreement between DINASBA, the Social Investment Fund, and&#13;
each regional development corporation, or Department government in 1996, to execute the project, was&#13;
discussed and agreed during negotiations (annex 4).&#13;
47.    Special account. A special account will be established in U.S. dollars in the Central Bank of&#13;
Bolivia. The initial allocation-sufficient for about four months of expenditures--will be US$ 1.2 million.&#13;
The authorized allocation shall be limited to US$600,000 until the combined credit withdrawals have&#13;
reached US$5 million. Funds from the account will be available only for IDA's share of project costs. IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
will replenish the special account as requested on receipt of evidence that expenditures made were eligible&#13;
for financing from the credit proceeds.&#13;
48.    Annual project review. A project review involving the government and IDA will be held each year,&#13;
not later than January 31, starting in 1997. This review is essential for project implementation. Draft terms&#13;
of reference for the review will be included in the implementation manual (annex 14). Moreover, the project&#13;
will finance a number of studies and a monitoring and evaluation system (annex 7), that will assist&#13;
PROSABAR, the rural water and sanitation sector in Bolivia and IDA in reviewing the project's&#13;
performance. In addition to the annual review, two workshops will be held. The first, to be held within&#13;
ninety days of Board presentation, will explain IDA procedures. The second will be at the beginning of the&#13;
third year of project implementation, to review and update the implementation manual and technical&#13;
standards. Outline terms of reference for the project review are included in annex 16.&#13;
B.     Selection criteria&#13;
49.    Investments for the first year of project implementation have been selected based on the demand for&#13;
water and sanitation services from communities, and municipalities and the departments have been selected&#13;
based on the total number of households without access to these services. The distribution of the different&#13;
technological options, service levels and community sizes of the first-year program is shown in annex 5.&#13;
Focusing first-year implementation efforts in departments in the Altiplano was critical for efficient use of&#13;
human and financial resources, and for applying the lessons learned from the Potosi pilot project. For&#13;
subsequent years (1996-2000) all departments and municipalities could be eligible for financing if they&#13;
meet the criteria presented in annex 12. These criteria will be revised annually to incorporate adjustments.&#13;
C.     Supervision&#13;
50.    The project management unit will supervise the project, including compliance with project and&#13;
institutional agreements. The project implementation manual (annex 14) will contain basic project&#13;
management procedures. The implementation manual should be formally adopted before credit&#13;
effectiveness. Annual reviews and supervision will be based on well-defined and measurable indicators&#13;
developed during appraisal. The project's perfonnance will be measured against a number of wcll-dcfined&#13;
and measurable monitoring indicators as well as a number of indicators which due to the demand-driven&#13;
character of the project can not be determined beforehand (annex 18).&#13;
51.    The supervision requirement for the project is estimated at fifty staff-weeks from credit&#13;
effectiveness to credit closing (four years). The professional expertise required to supervise the project&#13;
include an engineer with experience in rural projects, a sociologist or community development specialist,&#13;
and an institutional development expert. Supervision requirements will be intense during the first two years&#13;
of project implementation, when at least twelve staff-weeks will be needed annually (annex 16).&#13;
D.     Procurement&#13;
52.    Procurement for the institutional component will involve recruitment of national and international&#13;
consultants to provide training services and technical assistance, and small purchases of goods and&#13;
equipment. Implementation of the rural water and sanitation infrastructure program will consist of&#13;
contracts for civil works and for the procurement of goods and equipment. International competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
bidding (ICB) will be used for civil works contracts financed by subgrants exceeding US$1 million, and for&#13;
goods and equipment financed by subgrants exceeding US$100,000. To the extent practicable, contracts&#13;
for goods and works financed by subgrants shall be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost more than&#13;
the equivalent of US$1 million for works and US$100,000 for goods.&#13;
53.    All other procurement activities will be carried out through national competitive bidding (NCB),&#13;
with the exception of contracts for civil works financed by subgrants costing less than US$50,000 and for&#13;
goods and equipment financed by subgrants costing less than US$25,000. NCB procedures will be used to&#13;
the aggregate limit of US$5 million for civil works financed by subgrants and US$750,000 for goods,&#13;
equipment, and vehicles financed by subgrants.&#13;
54.    Contracts for small civil works financed by subgrants costing less than US$50,000 could be&#13;
awarded on the basis of at least three price quotations, or if only one quote can be obtained under direct&#13;
contracting, up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million. Contracts for works other than those financed by&#13;
subgrants will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of at least three&#13;
price quotations. If only one quote can be obtained, works not financed by subgrants may be procured&#13;
under direct contracting up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$200,000. National shopping can be&#13;
used for goods financed by subgrants estimated to cost less than US$25,000, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$250,000. Goods other than goods financed by subgrants will be procured under contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of national shopping procedures.&#13;
55.    The Social Investment Fund, responsible for procurement of the investment component, has had a&#13;
well documented experience with IDA financed projects. Standard bidding documents already approved by&#13;
IDA under the Second Social Investment Fund project (C2532-BO) will be used for NCB procurement&#13;
under the proposed project. Since Bolivia's legislation with respect to NCB defers in part with IDA's&#13;
principles and rules of procurement, during negotiations agreement was reached with the Borrower on&#13;
principles and rules of procurement which shall expressly govern all procurement of goods and works&#13;
under NCB. IDA issued documents will be used for ICB procurement. Procurement for the institutional&#13;
capacity building program will be managed by the UNDP, under a management agreement with the&#13;
Bolivian Government. Supervision of procurement will be managed by the IDA's Resident Mission in La&#13;
Paz; a procurement assistant has been relocated to La Paz to assist the Project Implementation Manager&#13;
during the first year of project execution.&#13;

56.    In addition to reviewing the investment subprojects and associated community development&#13;
programs for the first year of project implementation, IDA will review ex-ante procurement documents for&#13;
contracts for civil works and goods financed by subgrants under ICB procedures and for civil works&#13;
contracts financed by subgrants costing more than US$250,000. Documentation for the other subprojects&#13;
will be available at the Social Investment Fund for IDA staff and auditors. IDA will review ex-ante all&#13;
procurement documents for goods and equipment contracts not financed by subgrants exceeding&#13;
US$50,000. IDA also will exercise prior review of the documentation and steps for the procurement of&#13;
consulting services costing US$25,000 or above for firms and US$5,000 or above for individuals. For all&#13;
other contracts and documentation, the Social Investment Fund will maintain those involving the rural&#13;
water and sanitation infrastructure program, and DINASBA and the UNDP will maintain those relating to&#13;
procurement of the institutional capacity building program to IDA's satisfaction, making them available for&#13;
inspection by IDA staff and auditors. The proposed review thresholds provide for prior review by IDA of&#13;
approximately 75% of the total value of IDA-financed contracts.&#13;
E.     Disbursement&#13;
57.    The IDA credit will cover up to 100 percent of the amount disbursed under subgrants which will&#13;
finance contracts for the construction of water supply and sanitation systems under the rural water and&#13;
sanitation infrastructure program, including discrete or bulk procurement of the related equipment; 100&#13;
percent of foreign and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for procurement of office&#13;
equipment, vehicles, and similar items related to the operations of the project implementing agencies; 85&#13;
percent of civil works for pilot projects that test and develop low-cost water and sanitation technologies&#13;
and/or methodologies for community mobilization in investment subprojects; 100 percent of contracts for&#13;
consulting services; 100 percent of travel costs for the institutional strengthening program; and 100 percent&#13;
of the UNDP fee.&#13;
58.    Disbursements for (i) civil works contracts financed by subgrants of less than US$250,000; (ii)&#13;
and goods contracts financed by subgrants of less than US$ 100,000; (iii) goods not financed by subgrants&#13;
costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or less; (iv) works other than works financed by subgrants; (v)&#13;
consulting contracts with firms and individuals costing less than US$25,000 and US$5,000 respectively;&#13;
and (vi) training, travel costs and the UNDP fee, will be made under the statement of expenditures&#13;
procedure. Advance contracting-about US$3 million-will be permitted, in accordance with the&#13;
disbursement categories and percentages as established in the legal agreement and provided that it follows&#13;
IDA's procurement guidelines. It is a condition of disbursement for the payments on account of a subgrant&#13;
that SIF and the corresponding eligible municipality have entered into a subgrant agreement under terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
59.    Retroactive financing. Reimbursement of up to US$1.7 million will be permitted for expenditures&#13;
made in accordance with procurement procedures agreed to under the project from August 1, 1995,&#13;
provided that the credit is signed no later than July 31, 1996. If the credit is signed at a later date, the date&#13;
for eligibility of expenditures for retroactive financing will be modified so that the period covered by&#13;
retroactive financing is no longer than one year. Retroactive financing is recommended to ensure timely&#13;
provision of technical assistance for project management and procurement of investments already&#13;
negotiated with communities and approved by IDA during appraisal. The UNDP has offered the&#13;
Government of Bolivia bridge financing of up to US$3 million, to be reimbursed before December 15,&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
60.    Closing date. Project implementation is expected to last four years. Based on the assumption that&#13;
the credit will become effective in June 1996, the credit closing date will be December 31, 2000.&#13;
F      Audits&#13;
61.    DINASBA/PROSABAR, UNASBAs, the UNDP, the Social Investment Fund, and the other&#13;
entities concerned will maintain separate accounts for all project expenditures involving the use of IDA&#13;
credit proceeds. These accounts will be audited annually by external independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The audits will include the special account and project account. All audit contracts will be awarded&#13;
prior to the end of the calendar year and the audit should be submitted to IDA for review and comment no&#13;
later than June 30 of the following year. All audit costs wvill be financed by Bolivia.&#13;
G.     Reporting&#13;
62.    DINASBA/PROSABAR will prepare a quarterly evaluation on the status of project&#13;
implementation (annex 15), based on monitoring indicators (annex 18), a summary of relevant statistical&#13;
and financial data for each project component and activity, major project achievements, possible issues&#13;
with remedial actions, and fulfillment of covenants. These evaluations Will be consolidated in a report&#13;
which will be submitted to IDA for review and comment no later than November 30 of each year of project&#13;
implementation, starting in 1996. This report will be formalized in standard fornats which were defined&#13;
and agreed during negotiations (annex 15). Each local unit also will prepare an annual operational plan&#13;
for the execution of activities under their auspices during each year of project implementation, including&#13;
guarantees of budget allocations for pre-imvestment financing. This plan will be submitted by DINASBA to&#13;
IDA for review and approval no later than December 15 of each year, starting in 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Experience from Previous Projects and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.     Few projects and institutions have had an active presence in water and sanitation projects in&#13;
dispersed rural areas, which are the most deprived areas of Bolivia. IDA has financed water and sanitation&#13;
investments focusing on poor periurban areas through four social investment projects, two with the now-&#13;
defunct Social Emergency Fund (SEF) and two through its successor, the Social Investment Fund (SIF).&#13;
From 1991 to 1994, the Dutch government-through the UNDP (UNDP)-World Bank Water and&#13;
Sanitation Programn-financed the implementation of a pilot project to benefit people in the poorest&#13;
communities in the Department of Potosi. The experience accumulated in the Potosi project, which included&#13;
strong NGO participation, provided a sound conceptual basis for the preparation of PROSABAR. NGOs&#13;
like CARE, CCH, and PROANDES-UNICEF also have been successful in implementing projects in rural&#13;
Bolivia.&#13;
Yacupaj&#13;
2.     Yacupaj means "for the water" in the Quechua language. The Yacupaj pilot project began in 1991&#13;
with the objective of designing and testing strategies for the provision of sustainable water and sanitation&#13;
services to the dispersed rural population of the Altiplano. The project, which cost US$2.8 million, was&#13;
executed in four provinces of the Department of Potosi by the UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation&#13;
Program. In three years the project worked in 520 communities and trained 190 rural teachers, 200&#13;
infirmary assistants, 290 builders, and 600 operators. The project built and installed 220 water systems,&#13;
750 manual pumps, and 2,400 sanitation facilities, and benefited 31,000 inhabitants with water services&#13;
and 30,000 inhabitants with sanitation services. Furthermore, 85 percent of the population use and keep&#13;
their lavatories clean, 60 percent of women know how to treat illnesses like mange, diarrhea, and cholera,&#13;
and 30 percent of the users have varied their water use. They water orchards, use solar tents, and provide&#13;
their animals with water.&#13;
3.     Project implementation. The promotion stage began with NGOs visiting the communities to&#13;
explain the scope and benefits of the project, emphasizing the economic benefits of the project in terms of&#13;
health improvements and time savings. Once the communities had agreed to participate in the project the&#13;
process of demand generation was initiated. NGOs and community promoters organized hygiene education&#13;
activities. The promoters and NGO staff trained community members to identify their needs for basic&#13;
sanitation. Then, the comnunities were organized to initiate the work and the people elected representatives&#13;
to the water committees that were created. The community had to buy construction materials from local&#13;
shops, paying 30 percent of the costs. They also contributed labor and local materials to the scheme, with&#13;
the project paying the remaining 70 percent for non-local materials and cost of the mason. The average per&#13;
capita cost of water infrastructure investment has been US$12, demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost,&#13;
sustainable projects. During building of the works, the community elected people to be trained in operations&#13;
and maintenance. Once the construction was completed the project periodically monitored the use of the&#13;
works for three months. Project maintenance, water quality control, women's participation, promoter's&#13;
work, spare parts availability, and changes in hygiene habits were reviewed and modified when necessary.&#13;
Lessons learned&#13;
4.     The most important lessons learned from the above experiences and, in particular, from the Potosi&#13;
pilot project are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
*   Communities should be the final decisionmakers throughout the life of a project, from planning to&#13;
operations.&#13;
*  The process of commnunity mobilization, training, and demand generation is key to ensuring conscious,&#13;
active, and permanent participation of the community throughout and after project completion.&#13;
*  Even the poorest communities are willing to provide labor and contribute up to 30 percent of the&#13;
capital investment costs in cash and in kind.&#13;
*  The active participation of women, who are the principal water users, at all stages of the project was&#13;
key in ensuring the project's success.&#13;
*  Community members, especially women, can be trained to undertake management operations and&#13;
service maintenance activities.&#13;
*  Simple, low-cost, and easy-to-maintain technologies are key to the success of rural water and sanitation&#13;
projects.&#13;
*  The communities' contribution to the investment cost is key to creating a sense of belonging and&#13;
ensuring sustainability.&#13;
*  Training and hygiene education in the health, education, and sanitation sectors are essential to the&#13;
effective and sustained use of the services.&#13;
*  Technical support for operations and maintenance is required at the community, municipal, and&#13;
department levels; and, at the end of the project, the region must have adequate institutions to assist in&#13;
maintaining and expanding the systems.&#13;
*  NGOs seem to be effective in working at the grassroots level and in most cases have demonstrated&#13;
efficiency and reliability in undertaking rural water and sanitation programs.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Project Design&#13;
1.     Most rural water and sanitation investments in Bolivia have been selected almost entirely for their&#13;
technical merits, with limited consideration of their sustainability or economic efficiency. The assumption&#13;
underlying such projects is that people have basic needs for water and sanitation that should be met,&#13;
independent of the actual demand and willingness to pay for such services. Investment decisions often are&#13;
based on poorly defined poverty assessments, which has led to low service coverage, inefficient investment,&#13;
and inadequate sustainability of services.&#13;
2.     In the absence of a policy framework for rural water and sanitation, many institutions make&#13;
investments based on their own experience and policy agenda. This approach results in externally&#13;
determined levels of service that do not reflect local desires. For instance, non-governmental organizations&#13;
like CARE favor gravity-fed water supply systems and individual connections with per capita costs ranging&#13;
from US$50 to US$200. But the UNDP-World Bank Potosi project chose more cost-effective technologies,&#13;
generally shallow wells and hand pumps shared by three to five families, with per capita construction costs&#13;
ranging from US$15 to US$40 (annex 2). The Social Investment Fund is more concerned with the&#13;
transparency and speed of the procurement process and the quality of supervision for social spending&#13;
projects. The fund pays little attention to sustainability, and its per capita costs for rural water supply&#13;
range from US$70 to US$120, including a management fee of 6 to 15 percent. Few projects receive cash&#13;
contributions from beneficiaries, but in-kind contributions of unskilled labor and local material normally&#13;
are provided, particularly in smaller communities. Regional corporations financed up to 25 percent of&#13;
investment costs until 1993, and municipalities have done so since 1994.&#13;
3.     Design principles. Community participation is the primary design principle for improving&#13;
sustainability and economic efficiency. Participation should go beyond the traditional community-based&#13;
participation model, narrowly defined as the mobilization of local groups to ratify decisions made by&#13;
outsider planners, to include ownership of, responsibility for, and decision making about water supply and&#13;
sanitation services. The proposed project will make full use of the participatory planning process devised in&#13;
the Popular Participation Law, through which communities-organized through the Organizaciones&#13;
Territoriales de Base-express their demand for water and sanitation services, take responsibility for the&#13;
management of such services, and are willing to invest in capital and recurrent costs.&#13;
4.     A second design principle is to ensure that the proposed investments are a high priority for the&#13;
community and the society. The project relies on the five-year municipal development plans and annual&#13;
operating budgets prepared by each municipality in collaboration with their Organizaciones Territoriales&#13;
de Base and Comites de Vigilancia. These plans, cleared by the regional corporations and approved by the&#13;
national public investment secretariat, allow the use of funds transferred to municipalities (paragraph 10).&#13;
The 1994 plans gave high priority to water supply and to a lesser extent to sanitation, second only to&#13;
production infrastructure and rural roads. In addition, the selection process for municipalities and&#13;
departments now allows for departments to be replaced if they lack sufficient funds to finance pre-&#13;
investment or have a history of poor performance, according to simple and transparent rules of the game&#13;
(annex 12).&#13;
5.     Least-cost and demand-driven investments can be ensured by defining low per-capita investment&#13;
grants and by maximizing the financial contribution of municipalities and communities to the project.&#13;
Grant caps also help to rectify allocative distortions of scarce public subsidies to the water and sanitation&#13;
sector. These grants were established based on the analysis of 227 rural water projects financed by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Social Investment Fund from 1990 to date (table 1), and on engineering estimates obtained of about 300&#13;
small water projects during project preparation (table 2). According to the analysis of PROSABAR water&#13;
projects which were prepared under the technical criteria aiming at least-cost and demand-driven&#13;
investment, a grant cap for water supply of US$ 50 per-capita was initially established. However, after&#13;
numerous discussions with the SIF, grant caps to initiate project implementation were set at US$ 70 per-&#13;
capita for water supply, based primarily on the analysis of SIF's projects. For sanitation systems and for&#13;
latrines, values of US$ 65 per-capita and US$ 65 per-unit were set respectively. The actual investment&#13;
subsidy received by the beneficiaries will be probably lower as the project Will finance either the grant cap&#13;
or 70 percent of investmnent costs whatever is the lower value. It is expected that in he second year of&#13;
project implementation a lower value, prepared by the PROSABAR team, will be adopted for water&#13;
systems because better cost information will become available, while at the same time higher efficiency will&#13;
result in a reduction of investment cost and hence a lower investment ceiling. The financial contributions of&#13;
municipalities and communities were established by analyzing their actual payments to recent projects, and&#13;
by their willingness to accept the project's financial rules. Willingness to pay for water is high-a January&#13;
1994 survey of 604 households in peri-urban areas of Cochabamba found that households without&#13;
connections to public water systems pay water vendors US$3 per cubic meter, compared with US$0.34 per&#13;
cubic meter for households connected to the water network. Families that depend on water vendors spend,&#13;
on average, 8.2 percent of their disposable income on water.&#13;
6.     To attain long-term sustainability of water and sanitation services, even in rural areas, full cost&#13;
recovery should be pursued. Otherwise, operations and maintenance of infrastructure assets will not be&#13;
possible. This is a difficult issue for most water and sanitation projects. Communities often assume that&#13;
social infrastructure automatically will be replaced--after it has consumed its useful life--with government&#13;
support and financing. But during appraisal it was demonstrated that the long-run marginal costs of a wide&#13;
range of low-cost technologies could be afforded even by the poorest rural communities-even those with&#13;
an annual per capita cash income of US$96 (annex 10). The project will support the development of a cost&#13;
recovery policy for rural water and sanitation services, including the operational and institutional&#13;
arrangements that will be required to implement this policy. Field studies should be conducted during the&#13;
first two years of project implementation to complete the analysis made during project appraisal. Willing&#13;
municipalities and communities should test operational arrangements before the policy is launched for the&#13;
entire country.&#13;
7.     A third important element of project design emerges from the highly dispersed nature of rural&#13;
communities in Bolivia and the large economies of scale which can be achieved by grouping together&#13;
communities into packages for service delivery. This not only substantially reduces project preparation,&#13;
bidding, implementation and supervision costs, but it also promotes investment sustainability as&#13;
neighboring communities are trained together with the municipal government, thereby creating a mutual&#13;
support and technical assistance system which they can draw upon at a later date. The need for project&#13;
efficiency must be compatible with the demand-responsive nature of the project. Community, municipality&#13;
and departmental eligibility criteria have therefore been established which will bring into balance these two&#13;
concerns (see Annex 12).&#13;
8.     Project rules and the adaptive approach. Because it is difficult to predict community demand, the&#13;
financial policy and the eligibility criteria will require flexibility in project planning and implementation.&#13;
The project will rely on lessons learned in earlier phases of project execution to guide the planning and&#13;
implementation of subsequent activities. To support this "learning by doing" approach, an effective&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system will monitor project implementation. In addition, special process and&#13;
impact evaluation studies will verify if the desired incentives are in fact created by the project rules.&#13;
Lessons will be analyzed and applied to adjust project strategies and policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
9.     The Social Investment Fund. The SIF will be responsible for administering the investment&#13;
component of the project. SIF established itself as an effective institution to manage social spending, with&#13;
an excellent record in IDA-financed projects. It uses IDA-approved procurement procedures and is quite&#13;
familiar with the IDA requirements for disbursement of funds, reporting and auditing. SIF also attracts&#13;
qualified personnel through competitive consulting contracts. Although political interference is common&#13;
through changes in top management, it is apparently less frequent than in most public offices in Bolivia.&#13;
The Board of SIF meets three times a week, and is accountable for the approval of all investment projects,&#13;
through simple and transparent rules. Moreover, SIF has been instrumental in policy formulation in social&#13;
sectors, especially in rural areas, because of the structural weaknesses of most sectoral institutions in&#13;
Bolivia.&#13;
10.    Until recently the cost of running SIF has been funded by the same credits and grants designed to&#13;
finance social investments, through specific components for institutional building and strengthening. Since&#13;
the approval of the Popular Participation Law, SIF is proposing to finance its operations by accounting 90&#13;
percent of investments from grants and credits from the central government and 25 percent from municipal&#13;
contributions. The excess 15 percent will finance operational cost, overhead, and a preinvestment fund.&#13;
11.    For this project, the SIF will continue to operate under this procedure. However, agreement was&#13;
reached during appraisal between the SIF, the National Secretary of Urban Affairs, the National Secretary&#13;
of Policy and Social Investment, and IDA to monitor operational costs and overhead based on productivity&#13;
indicators which introduce clear efficiency incentives and accountability (annex 18). This agreement is also&#13;
designed to a progressive decentralization of the operation of SIF, and a closer interaction with sectoral&#13;
institutions, by clearly separating policy formulation functions from investment implementation (annex 13).&#13;
12.    The gross cost of SIF was estimated at 6.3 percent of investment (US$32.0 million) distributed into&#13;
operational cost 3.5 percent, overhead 2.0 percent and logistic cost 0.8 percent. However, SIF claims that&#13;
its actual operating costs is closer to 13%. Operational cost includes direct personnel cost for evaluation of&#13;
investment proposals, management of bidding process including preparation of tender documents, follow-&#13;
up of construction execution, and quality assurance of the overall procurement process. Logistic cost&#13;
includes per-diem fees inside Bolivia, communication expenses, and vehicles.&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
A.     Project Management&#13;
A.1    Support to DIXASBA/PROSABAR (US$1, 125,000)&#13;
1.     The PROSABAR staff assigned to the central project office in DINASBA will be funded through&#13;
credit proceeds, and will include the following professional and support staff: a coordinator, a community&#13;
mobilization specialist, a technical and engineering advisor, an administrator, a computer&#13;
assistant/monitoring specialist, two secretaries, and a messenger. An advisor will also be recruited for one&#13;
year to assist in project start-up activities, as well as other short-term consultants to be hired according to&#13;
specific demands approved by IDA. Office operating expenses and a small amount of equipment will also&#13;
be included in the technical assistance component. DINASBA will provide office space, furniture, and&#13;
equipment (most of which was procured through PPF funds) and pay all utilities as an input to project&#13;
management. Terms of reference for all consultants will be included in the project implementation manual.&#13;
A. 2   Support to the United Nations Development Programme (US$275, 000)&#13;
2.     Justification and design. The UNDP has a large and effective operation in Bolivia. It participated&#13;
the Potosi pilot project (annex 2) and managed the two PPFs for project preparation (paragraph). The&#13;
Government of Bolivia and the UNDP had agreed to a bridge financing for about US$3.0 million to initiate&#13;
project implementation. Moreover, during appraisal agreement was reached between the Government of&#13;
Bolivia, UNDP and IDA to request UNDP's assistance as a disbursement agent for the institutional&#13;
component of the project, under similar arrangements used for management of the PPF advance. The&#13;
administrative cost for UNDP--calculated for four years--will be funded by the project, including one full-&#13;
time project officer--equivalent to about US$40,000 a year--and 50 percent of a administrative assistant.&#13;
B.     Sector Strengthening&#13;
B. I   Capacity Building (US$1, 400, 000)&#13;
3.     The bulk of support to project management at the department level will be provided as of January&#13;
1996, by the departmental governments. In addition to office space, furniture, a four-wheel drive vehicle,&#13;
and operating expenses, each departmental government will provide the following full-time staff in the&#13;
LTNASBA unit: one director, one engineer, one social scientist, one computer specialist, one administrator,&#13;
two drivers, and one secretary.&#13;
4.     Credit proceeds will fund a technical advisor and a social advisor in each UNASBA for three years&#13;
and will provide resources for the purchase of a four-wvheel drive vehicle, water-quality testing equipment,&#13;
a computer, a printer, and a telephone and fax for each UNASBA. These advisors will be jointly recruited&#13;
by the departmental government and the DINASBA/PROSABAR team and will report to the departmental&#13;
government. Terms of reference will be included in the project implementation manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
B.2    Project Dissemination (US$1 70,000)&#13;
5.     Public relations and emphasizing stakeholder consultation and dialogue contribute greatly to the&#13;
potential for sustainable implementation and demand generation. This is particularly true for projects that&#13;
require attitude changes on the part of beneficiary groups and implementation agencies. PROSABAR is a&#13;
participatory project that involves attitude changes at two levels: civil society and institutional. The civil&#13;
society (beneficiaries) must take on new responsibilities: they must participate in project design in a&#13;
democratic and participatory way, and they must assume responsibilities for deciding technical options and&#13;
assume (sustainable) responsibility and ownership for service administration, management, and operation.&#13;
At the institutional level PROSABAR, UNASBA, municipalities, and community organizations must&#13;
understand the concept of community participation and facilitate its implementation.&#13;
6.     Recognizing this, communication inputs for PROSABAR have three types of implementation:&#13;
communication for public relations, communication for consultation, and communication for change in&#13;
attitudes, ideas, and beliefs. Communities must change from being passive beneficiaries to active and&#13;
responsible managers of water systems, and project implementation agencies at the institutional level must&#13;
learn to become facilitators of the community participation process.&#13;
7.     Implementation of these different types of conmmunication will take place in two phases (roughly&#13;
corresponding to the phases of the project cycle). The first and second levels, involving communication&#13;
activities for public relations and awareness raising, will begin at project start-up in each department and&#13;
will last for six months. The third level of developing communication activities for changes in attitude will&#13;
begin after six months of raising awareness in each department. This will include communication packages&#13;
for communities in hygiene education, decision making, civil responsibilities, and so on, as well as&#13;
communication initiatives with project implementation agencies at the institutional level.&#13;
8.     Public relations. This initiative will develop a logo for PROSABAR (through a competition&#13;
involving communities and municipalities, as a way of starting owvnership); prepare printed pamphlets and&#13;
posters on PROSABAR conditionalities; distribute material to institutions (UNASBAs, municipalities, and&#13;
communities); and hold launching workshops with stakeholders on PROSABAR and its conditionalities.&#13;
9.     Consultation. This will involve surveying communication initiatives of other organizations (United&#13;
Nations Children's Fund, Johns Hopkins, ERBOL, and so on) for lessons leamed and deliver public&#13;
relations material for inclusion in their communication activities; and developing a relationship with local&#13;
radio in each province (or municipality) and preparing public service messages on PROSABAR and its&#13;
conditionalities for broadcast. This effort will be coordinated with each municipality since the broadcast&#13;
also will contain the time and date of a follow-up meeting for community leaders. In addition, the project&#13;
will prepare cassettes on PROSABAR for use at markets and health posts, and will distribute public&#13;
relations material at the same time.&#13;
10.    Changing attitudes. Attitudes will be changed by identifying target audiences at the community&#13;
and institutional levels. Using rapid appraisal methodology-and information from other project&#13;
intermediaries---this wvill assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of each group. At the community&#13;
level this initiative will develop four pilot radio packages through the association of local educational radio&#13;
stations (ERBOL), making use of soap operas and dramas to involve communities in the design for hygiene&#13;
education, project management, the role of women, and so on. At the institutional level this initiative will&#13;
develop discussions with stakeholders to assist their understanding of the community participation model&#13;
and to learn their fears and constraints. Finally, the initiative will use hand-held camcorders to film group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
discussions at all levels and play them back to the groups to promote further discussion.&#13;
B. 3          Community Development (US$3, 300, 000)&#13;
11.    The lessons learned, particularly over the past decade, indicate that the sustainability of water and&#13;
sanitation services is contingent on a careful balance between resource allocation for service delivery and&#13;
development of local capacity. Consequently, a major focus for PROSABAR is technical assistance for&#13;
community development. This capacity-building goes beyond technical advice on operations and&#13;
maintenance, management issues, and financial planning, moving into the realm of behaviors and attitudes.&#13;
12.    The community development program will be dedicated to funding activities at the community level&#13;
that will ensure the quality, sustainability, and effective use of the infrastructure. Intermediary&#13;
organizations (annex 9) will be contracted at the department level by the UNASBAs to assist the&#13;
comrmunities in implementing the following .4;Livities:&#13;
*  analyzing and selecting the desired level of service;&#13;
*  collecting baseline socioeconomic and water resource data;&#13;
*  ensuring the full participation of all community members;&#13;
*  developing a financing plan for both capital and recurrent costs;&#13;
*  organizing a water committee for construction and operations and maintenance;&#13;
* undertaking hygiene and environmental education and promoting behavior change;&#13;
*  where appropriate, assisting in self-construction or community supervision of the contractors during&#13;
works construction;&#13;
*  establishing a tariff structure and financial management scheme for water and sanitation;&#13;
*  training community operators in operations and maintenance and in the importance of a water quality&#13;
control system;&#13;
*  ensuring links between the community and municipal government, through the semiannual completion&#13;
of water system monitoring sheets.&#13;
These activities require interventions in the communities before, during, and after system construction, and&#13;
require the establishment of trust and confidence between the community and the intermediary.&#13;
13.    Ideally, one large intermediary would be contracted per department, on an annual basis and for a&#13;
defined number of communities and municipalities. This intermediary could use several smaller&#13;
intermediaries for the implementation of project activities in smaller geographical areas. Given that there&#13;
are few qualified intermediaries in Bolivia and that this type of scattered work may not be financially&#13;
attractive to international firms, in some instances intermediaries will have to be hired to implement smaller&#13;
packages, of a minimum fifteen communities. Terms of reference for selecting the intermediary will be&#13;
agreed to before credit negotiations, and will be included in the project implementation manual.&#13;
B. 4   Management Information System (US$100, 000)&#13;
14.    Following a programmatic approach, whereby lessons learned during early stages are fed back into&#13;
project implementation, the project will require a powerful management information system (MIS), to track&#13;
investments and contracts and to analyze data relating processes and costs to physical results and impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
15.    The MIS for the project, which is being developed during project preparation, will build on the&#13;
system used by the Social Investment Fund to track investments and contracts (this system is being&#13;
evaluated and probably will be upgraded during the next six months), and will incorporate a few additional&#13;
indicators that are required for IDA's and PROSABAR's reporting requirements (annex 15, 18). The&#13;
system needs to be as simple as possible and each indicator needs to be justified in terms of who will input&#13;
the data and who will use it. Additional community-level baseline and impact assessment data will be&#13;
collected during project implementation and used for impact evaluation, however, this will be maintained at&#13;
the UNASBA level in order to reduce the amount of information contained in the project's MIS.&#13;
16.    The MIS will be installed in each UNASBA and users manuals produced. Programmers will be&#13;
trained, including those assigned from the UNASBAs. In addition, the MIS will need to be evaluated and&#13;
improved after the first two years of project implementation.&#13;
B.5    Water Quality (US$150,000)&#13;
17.    The water quality program of the project will involve the monitoring of the quality of drinking&#13;
water through the collection and analysis of water samples in the project communities. This program is&#13;
designed in two phases the first is under the responsibility of the UNASBAs and municipalities; the second&#13;
under the municipalities and the communities. Collection of samples will be a responsibility of&#13;
municipalities and communities with guidance, coordination, and quality control of the UNASBAs.&#13;
Laboratory analysis of water samples will be financed through the project for a maximum of two years in&#13;
each municipality. Municipalities will assume the cost of analysis after two years. Private labs and&#13;
universities will be selected on a competitive basis to perform the analysis. The project will supply field&#13;
water testing equipment to each UNASBA qualified to the program (component B. 1). Sampling procedures&#13;
including frequency are included in the Project Design Manual. Water standards are included in annex 5. It&#13;
is estimated based on recent experiences in Bolivia that analysis will cost about US$15 per sample, on the&#13;
average.&#13;
B. 6   Research and Development (US$200, 000)&#13;
18.    A limited amount of resources is available for testing and developing low-cost water and sanitation&#13;
technologies and/or the design of methodologies and training materials for the participation of communities&#13;
in investment subprojects. The results of these pilot activities will be disseminated and eventually&#13;
mainstreamed into the investment package. Examples of pilot projects include low-cost deep well&#13;
technologies, hygiene and environmental education classes in municipal school districts as a complement to&#13;
the PROSABAR investment program, water quality testing directly by the municipal government,&#13;
educational field days at local markets using women's groups, and so on.&#13;
19.    The funds will be available from DINASBAtPROSABAR based on proposals submitted by the&#13;
UNASBAs, although proposals also may be prepared directly by municipalities or intermediaries. Each&#13;
pilot project will have the following steps: project design and proposal preparation, agreements reached&#13;
with the relevant partner agencies (for example, the National Secretary of Education, the National&#13;
Secretary of Rural Development, and so on), project implementation, result evaluation, documentation and&#13;
dissemination, and a proposal for scaling up.&#13;
B. 7   Impact and Process Evaluation (US$200, 000)&#13;
20.    Given the programmatic nature of PROSABAR and the wealth of experience that will be acquired&#13;
through the decentralized implementation model-which will make use of a wide array of intermediaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
from the private and non-governmental sectors-funds will be allocated to undertake special impact and&#13;
process evaluation studies to identify and share best practices.&#13;
21.    Three categories of evaluation will take place: institutional performance, project rules and&#13;
policies and impact on beneficiaries. The first will evaluate the adequacy, incentives and dynamics of key&#13;
institutions to provide/support water and sanitation services, including DINASBA, PROSABAR,&#13;
UNASBA, regional and municipal government, and community organizations. It will evaluate the decision&#13;
making process for effective implementation of the project and for sustainability of services, and will&#13;
include specific impact indicators of process efficiency at different stages of the project implementation&#13;
cycle (annex 18). The second will monitor the application of the project rules: the financial policy,&#13;
eligibility and prioritization criteria to ensure a demand-driven approach and the integration of training and&#13;
community development with the investments. Based on the results achieved, the rules may be modified&#13;
during project implementation. The third will evaluate impact on beneficiary communities: time used in&#13;
hauling water, water consumption patterns, hygiene and health improvements, etc. Independent consultants-&#13;
auditors would be hired in a competitive basis to perform impact evaluations, with results presented on&#13;
public hearings.&#13;
B.8    Studies (US$280,000)&#13;
22.    The three primary studies will be to: (i) assist the government in developing a regulatory&#13;
framework for the sector (linked to the SIRESE - law on sector regulation- initiative); (ii) elevating the&#13;
importance of the water and sanitation sector within the executive structure and integrating the lead sector&#13;
agency (DINASBA) into the civil service reform process; and (iii) developing a cost recovery policy for&#13;
rural water and sanitation (annex 6). These activities will be implemented by national and international&#13;
consultants. Although the NSUA will be directly responsible for preparing the terms of reference and&#13;
contracting and supervising the work, DINASBAIPROSABAR will administer the funds as part of the&#13;
project's technical assistance component.&#13;
B. 9   Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
23.    The monitoring and evaluation activities of the project have three clients: IDA, to measure project&#13;
performance; PROSABAR, to learn lessons from experience and feedback for improved project&#13;
implementation; and the water and sanitation sector as a whole, to elevate project results to national policy&#13;
formulation. PROSABAR will have primary responsibilities for project monitoring and evaluation. The&#13;
resources allocated and the activities performed in the Management Information System (B.4), the Impact&#13;
Evaluation (B.7) and Workshop (C.5) subcomponents of the project will all contribute to the monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and result analysis of the project. Furthermore, the activities relating to project monitoring'and&#13;
evaluation will benefit from direct technical assistance provided by the UNDP-World Bank Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program, based in La Paz. UNDP is providing $320,000 over four years to support this&#13;
assistance.&#13;
C.     Training&#13;
C.]    Municipal and Departmental governments (US$400, 000)&#13;
24.    Although the municipal governments will receive initial training from the contracted intermediary&#13;
in facility administration, operations, and maintenance as part of the community development program (see&#13;
section B.3), it is important that long-term institutional links be established between the municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
governments and the UNASBA in order to ensure the sustainability and monitoring of state-funded sectoral&#13;
investments. In addition to the UNASBA being able to provide a technical assistance and backstopping&#13;
function, the following areas of long-term support need to be provided to the newly emerging municipal&#13;
governments: tariff setting, water quality control, sector information system and monitoring of municipal&#13;
and community system functioning, and assistance in investment and replacement planning and financing.&#13;
25.    This technical assistance program is designed to be demand responsive to both the UNASBAs and&#13;
the municipal governments. A fixed sum will be set aside in DINASBA/PROSABAR, and will be available&#13;
upon request from the UJNASBAs through the submission of short proposals for specific interventions.&#13;
Funds will be available to finance consultancy services, equipment (such as for water quality testing,&#13;
computer software, and training materials), and seminars and workshops. The demand eventually will have&#13;
to come from the municipal governments, who will be required to share costs and to buy into this technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
C. 2   Community Organizations (US$270, 000)&#13;
26.    Although most rural water supply projects in Bolivia contain intensive programs for training&#13;
community water committees and system administrators and operators in simple operations and&#13;
maintenance tasks, these are short-term, one-shot courses implemented during the construction period.&#13;
Furthermore, no program exists in Bolivia that tests, certifies, and registers system operators.&#13;
27.    Not only would a certification program be a first step toward ensuring that staff being trained&#13;
through any investment activity (government-sponsored or non-govenmmental) has developed the required&#13;
skills to perform their tasks, a testing program of this nature could be used to evaluate the quality and&#13;
guarantee the consistency of the training imparted by the wide range of intermediaries hired throughout the&#13;
project implementation phase.&#13;
28.    An initial consultancy, estimated at US$15,000, would undertake three principal tasks: defining the&#13;
skills required for operators and administrators for different technology options and population sizes,&#13;
identifying key indicators that would be used to test and certify trainees (these should be practical);&#13;
identifying institutional options for implementation of the program, specifying one coordinating agency at&#13;
the national level (possibly the Association of Water Utilities), determining the role of the UNASBAs and&#13;
municipal govemments, identifying potential institutions that could deliver the training and certification,&#13;
and developing a specific workplan and budget for the certification program. It is expected that one&#13;
national agency would undertake testing and certification programs within each of the departments&#13;
participating in PROSABAR.&#13;
C. 3   Professional and Manufacturers Associations (US$ 70, 000)&#13;
29.    With the objective of strengthening the human resources that work in the sector, PROSABAR will&#13;
promote at least two courses a year, each lasting three days, with intemationally recognized professors.&#13;
Participants will pay the full cost of the course, and the course will be certified by the World Bank.&#13;
Planning of these courses will be on an annual basis, in accordance with the identified demand of Bolivian&#13;
sector professionals and manufacturers associations. The course contents will respond to themes such as&#13;
management of rural water and sanitation projects, appropriate technologies, participatory approaches&#13;
leading to sustainability, monitoring and evaluation of projects, and wastewater treatment.&#13;
C. 4   Implementing Agencies (US$150 000)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
30.    At the institutional level, planners and decision-makers (DINASBA) should be trained on sector&#13;
problem analysis, solution identification, policy formulation, and strategy development. Other institutional&#13;
actors (UNASBA, municipal governments,and communities) require sensitization to PROSABAR and&#13;
community participation issues, understanding of participatory methodologies and interpersonal&#13;
communication skills, adult education techniques, and appreciation of the complexities of PROSABAR&#13;
implementation and the Popular Participation Law. The intermediaries also need exposure to participatory&#13;
rural appraisal, participatory training (such as the SARAR techniques developed in the Potosi pilot&#13;
project), and rapid rural appraisal methods.&#13;
C.5    Workshops (USS210,000)&#13;
31.    Workshops are an effective tool to coordinate and exchange experiences in development projects.&#13;
In demand-driven projects this is an essential feature of the design to incorporate lessons learned in earlier&#13;
phases of project execution to guide the planning and implementation of subsequent activities. Three kinds&#13;
of workshops will be organized, as follows:&#13;
*  General evaluation. At the end of each year, but before presentation of annual consolidated report to&#13;
IDA, a workshop will be held to evaluate project performance and proposals for adjustments.&#13;
*  Specific evaluation. Workshops will be organized on-demand to review specific topics, including&#13;
among others: the financial policy, approaches to community mobilization, the design manual, etc.&#13;
* Lessons learned. Annual workshops might be organized for project entities, consultants, and NGOs, to&#13;
exchange experiences and lessons learned.&#13;
All workshops will be documented and summary reports will be distributed upon request. A small fee will&#13;
be charged to cover publication expenses.&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Indigenous and Gender Issues&#13;
Strategies to Facilitate Community Participation&#13;
1.    Information and understanding of communities is the first step toward achieving demand generation&#13;
and sustainable use of water and sanitation systems. The informnation gathered also establishes baseline&#13;
data for further work on designing technical assistance and capacity-building components. Efforts to&#13;
facilitate community participation in indigenous communities are constrained by the lack of a&#13;
comprehensive definition of indigenous peoples to clarify the different ethnic groups that reside within&#13;
project communities. To address this issue, this annex provides an overview of the indigenous peoples in&#13;
Bolivia. The annex analyzes whether the needs and perspectives of communities, particularly indigenous&#13;
communities, have been taken into account in project design. It also outlines the project's strategy for&#13;
bringing about community participation and demand generation.&#13;
2.     The definition used to identify indigenous peoples determines the quality of data. Although Bolivia&#13;
has large indigenous communities, the definition used in recent censuses (1988 and 1992) and household&#13;
surveys is superficial. First, because language is the key indicator to identify whether a person belongs to&#13;
an indigenous group. Second, because it only covers people over six years of age. Third, because the term&#13;
campesino has been used in Bolivia as synonymous with indigenous peoples, thus transforming an ethnic&#13;
concept into an occupation and class category.&#13;
3.     An operational definition must be composed of a set of indicators that captures the socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics and cultural uniqueness of an ethnic group. The Popular Participation Law defines&#13;
indigenous peoples as the descendants of populations living in a geographic region before or during&#13;
colonization and that currently live within the national territory. They have their own history, social&#13;
organization, language, and culture, identify themselves as members of an indigenous group, and may&#13;
retain all or part of their social, economic, cultural, and political institutions. This more comprehensive&#13;
definition must be taken into account by the Bureau of Census.&#13;
4.     Demographic and socioeconomic assessment. Bolivia is a multiethnic, multilingual, rural country.&#13;
There are more than thirty vernacular languages. Most of them are versions of Quechua and Aymara; other&#13;
linguistic families include Arawakan, Chapacuran, Uru-Chipaya, Mataco-Maca, Paonan, and Tupi.&#13;
According to the 1992 census, about 63 percent of the population is rural. Indigenous peoples account for&#13;
about half of the total population and 65 percent of the rural population. Quechua (58 percent) and Aymara&#13;
(40 percent) are the predominant indigenous ethnic groups. The Quechua monolingual-speaking peoples&#13;
account for 28 percent of the total population; Aymaras monolingual-speaking account for 19 percent.&#13;
About 38 of the rural population is Quechua monolingual, about 23 percent is Aymara monolingual.&#13;
5.     Beginning in July 1995, PROSABAR will operate in the departments of La Paz, Chuquisaca,&#13;
Cochabamba, and Potosi, covering 33 percent of the national territory. It also will cover most of the rural&#13;
population. In Chuquisaca, for instance, 67.5 percent of the population is rural. Although population&#13;
density is very low in Bolivia (6 persons per square kilometer), PROSABAR will deliver services to the&#13;
most highly populated departments, such as Cochabamba (20 persons per square kilometer) and La Paz&#13;
(15 persons per square kilometer). PROSABAR will be implemented in the most indigenous departments of&#13;
the country. Potosi, Cochabamba, and Chuquisaca are Quechua territories; La Paz is basically an Aymara&#13;
territory. In Potosi 76 percent of the total population is indigenous, 67 percent are Quechuas, and 85&#13;
percent live in rural areas. In Cochabamba 66 percent of the population is indigenous, 6 Ipercent are&#13;
Quechuas, and 79 percent live in rural areas. In Chuquisaca indigenous peoples account for 54 percent and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
appropriate technical options. PROSABAR will continue strengthening popular participation, building up&#13;
the capacity of NGOs to promote active beneficiary participation. The objective is to stress community&#13;
ownership to ensure long-term institutional sustainability once the project is finished. PROSABAR&#13;
organized a workshop with thirty NGOs that are evaluating the effectiveness of participatory approaches to&#13;
determine ways of improving them, and to disseminate the approach to be used in PROSABAR for&#13;
community mobilization.&#13;
12.    Since data and specific information are needed to understand the culture of indigenous groups and&#13;
the role of women in their societies, PROSABAR should work with NGOs to build up local information&#13;
systems. By organizing surveys, PROSABAR will systematically consult, monitor, and evaluate the&#13;
effectiveness of beneficiaries' involvement. The results will be used to strengthen the institutional capacity&#13;
of NGOs to work with communities. A series of short workshops and seminars will be organized to ensure&#13;
that ethnic minorities and women are represented in local committees and that their voice is taken into&#13;
account in all phases of the project. The evaluation of their participation will contribute to the capacity of&#13;
NGOs to promote beneficiary involvement.&#13;
13.    As the Secretaria Nacional de Participaci6n Popular (SNPP) has expressed-and IDA and&#13;
PROSABAR concur-that the biggest challenge to promoting community participation involves building&#13;
consensus among stakeholders, particularly among local institutions such as municipalities and&#13;
UNASBAS, in the meaning and development of participation and ownership. Changing the mentality of&#13;
these institutions, which have been steeped in centralist, top-down approaches for decades, is a major&#13;
challenge.&#13;
14.    A clear understanding of the meaning of community participation and its importance is crucial to&#13;
the success of the project. The process of defining conmnunity participation within the project will begin&#13;
with training the PROSABAR team. All stakeholders (including PROSABAR) must share the same&#13;
conceptual and methodological framework. Workshops will be organized among PROSABAR officials and&#13;
local stakeholders to discuss community participation and what it means and to participate in SARAR&#13;
techniques to get a feel for the methodologies used in the field to help bring about community&#13;
decisionmaking.&#13;
15.    The Government of Bolivia has recognized that effective community participation requires giving&#13;
back to people and communities their right to make decisions that affect their lives. The Popular&#13;
Participation Law outlines a participatory planning process through which Organizaciones Territoriales de&#13;
Base (OTBs) can express their demand for services in health, education, sports, and infrastructure (roads).&#13;
About 20 percent of funds normally allocated to regional development corporations have been sent to&#13;
municipalities to implenment this participatory process, which PROSABAR strongly supports.&#13;
16.    Relationships between PROSABAR and local organizations (OTBs, UNASBAS, municipalities,&#13;
regional development corporations) will be assessed and strengthened. PROSABAR will help to build the&#13;
capacity of local organizations, organizing seminars and workshops to provide technical assistance in such&#13;
areas as community participation techniques (including social and cultural assessment, social behavior,&#13;
consultation meetings, gender issues, and ethnic and gender participation in local committees) and&#13;
management skills (including administration, finance, and maintenance). Even though the regional&#13;
development corporations have started providing courses on administration, accounting, and so on, there is&#13;
a major need to assist municipalities in changing attitudes, to help them respect indigenous knowledge, to&#13;
leam skills in communication planning, and to fully understand the community participation process. This&#13;
same type of capacity-building is required for the UNASBAs, who will be playing an increasingly&#13;
important role in PROSABAR (annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are mainly rural Quechuas (51 percent). The Aymaras live on the Antiplano, the Andean highlands, a&#13;
geographical zone of about 170,000 square kilometers at medium elevation of 4,000 meters above sea&#13;
level, spread out over Lake Titicaca, extending into the south of the country. In the department, La Paz, 59&#13;
percent of the population is indigenous, 51 percent is Aymara, and 70 percent reside in rural areas next to&#13;
the lake.&#13;
6.     The lack of water and sanitation systems are crucial social problems in Bolivia. Only 24 percent of&#13;
the rural populations have access to clean water and just 18 percent have latrines. The water and sanitation&#13;
systems are particularly weak in the four PROSABAR departments. In Chuquisaca, for example, 56&#13;
percent of the population is rural and only 18.2 percent has access to clean water and 7.5 percent has&#13;
latrines. In La Paz only 24 percent of the rural population has clean water and 15 percent has latrines. The&#13;
situation is worse in Potosi-only 7 percent of rural people have latrines and 22 percent have a water&#13;
system. The child mortality rate in rural areas is 100 per 1,000 live births in Chuquisaca, 129 per 1,000 in&#13;
Potosi, 94 per 1,000 in Cochabamba, and 81 per 1,000 in La Paz.&#13;
7.     Twenty percent of the total population and thirty-seven percent of the rural population is illiterate.&#13;
PROSABAR will be implemented in departments with the highest illiteracy rates. Illiteracy in Chuquisaca&#13;
is 54 percent, and in Potosi it is 5 1 percent, representing the highest illiteracy rates registered in rural areas&#13;
in the entire country.'&#13;
8.     IDA and PROSABAR agree that it is critical to understand the culture and forms of social&#13;
organizations of indigenous groups, and that it is key to understand the role of women in indigenous&#13;
societies and in the PROSABAR project. In the Aymara communities 40 percent of the population are&#13;
women, is the Quechua population 58 percent is female. In indigenous societies leadership and participation&#13;
in decisionmaking processes are activities confined to males. Although women play the primary role in&#13;
resolving water and sanitation needs for their families, they play no role in decisionmaking. Women are&#13;
responsible for disposing child feces, implementing proper hygiene practices, carrying and using water, and&#13;
deciding how best to use their time and energy. Male migration and absence during harvests mean that&#13;
women and children remain in villages by themselves, adversely affected by inadequate water and&#13;
sanitation systems. Despite these circumstances, they have no formal represenitation in local water and&#13;
sanitation committees. Since women migrate less than men, they are the key stakeholders for institutional&#13;
and management sustainability. National counterparts and local NGOs should be encouraged to involve&#13;
women in decisionmaking processes to improve project sustainability and economic efficiency.&#13;
9.     Several water projects show that there is a cause and effect relationship hetween participation and&#13;
project performance (Isham and Narayan 1995). Encouraging beneficiary participation through active local&#13;
NGOs brings to the vanguard such key issues as the importance of incorporating indigenous culture and the&#13;
role of women into the design and management of a project.&#13;
10.    The skills of the users, predominantly women, at the local level have to be expanded and&#13;
upgraded. Women should be trained in planning, implementation, management, and monitoring of&#13;
sanitation, hygiene, and water services. Additional training for community organization also is needed. At&#13;
the national level government planners and decisionmakers should be trained on sector problem analysis,&#13;
solution identification, policy formulation, and strategy development. Gender awareness needs to be&#13;
promoted at the local level.&#13;
11.    Community participation. PROSABAR has successfully incorporated communities' views and&#13;
preferences into project design. Umbrella and local NGOs have played a key role in promoting beneficiary&#13;
participation and in creating water and sanitation local committees in charge of identifying and selecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
17.    PROSABAR has recognized the need to work through intermediaries such as NGOs or private&#13;
consultants to strengthen community-based organizations and to mediate between community groups and&#13;
government. Although this is a widely recognized model that has worked for a variety of Bank-financed&#13;
development programs, it is still a critical issue. In the selection of NGOs it is always necessary to evaluate&#13;
which sectors are included or excluded. For PROSABAR it is important to work with NGOs that are&#13;
legally established, that maintain mature relationships with the government, that have equal gender&#13;
representation, and that take ethnic issues seriously. It is crucial to work with NGOs that have a great deal&#13;
of accountability and that democratically consult beneficiaries (attachment 1).&#13;
18.    The role of intermediaries is to serve as interlocutors between IDA, PROSABAR, and the&#13;
beneficiaries. Internediaries should contribute to strengthening the ability of communities to control health&#13;
aspects of their lives by making informed choices on water systems and sanitation interventions. The&#13;
relationship that must be built between communities and intermediaries cannot be rushed, nor does it&#13;
necessarily conform to an extemal schedule. For this type of relationship to develop it is important that the&#13;
same intermediary be involved with the community from the beginning of the project through the post-&#13;
investment phase (attachment 2).&#13;
19.    Experience in other projects has led to the understanding that the use of communication methods&#13;
for awareness raising, consultation, and public hearings contributes greatly to the potential for sustainable&#13;
implementation. This is particularly true for projects that require behavioral change on the part of&#13;
beneficiary groups and implementors.&#13;
20.    It is recommended that the social component of PROSABAR be strengthened by the addition of&#13;
one staff member with a social focus. A team of two people strengthening the social process is much more&#13;
effective than one person working alone. Moreover, the technical assistance component of PROSABAR&#13;
focusing on the social component requires additional staff to coordinate workshops, backstop&#13;
intermediaries responsible for training, prepare terms of reference, and so on.&#13;

Criteria for Intermediary Selection&#13;
Experience                                      The potential intermediary will have been actively and&#13;
demonstrably effective in at least one of the following&#13;
fields over the period of one year:&#13;
* community development and social mobilization;&#13;
*  provision of water supply, sanitation, or related&#13;
facilities (such as education, health, and so on); or&#13;
.planning and project development at the grassroots level.&#13;
Legal status                                    Intermediaries would be duly registered.&#13;
Affiliation                                     Intermediaries would not have partisan political&#13;
affiliation or be subject to the directions of any foreign&#13;
government.&#13;
Membership                                      Except in gender-specific organizations, membership&#13;
would be open to men and women.&#13;
Financial management                            Potential intermediaries would have a bank account&#13;
(current) in sound operation, an adequate and open&#13;
accounting system, and a record of sound financial&#13;
management and stability.&#13;
Management and administrative capacities        The intermediary would have proven management and&#13;
administrative capabilities sufficient to plan, supervise,&#13;
and monitor activities pertaining to social mobilization.&#13;
Accountability                                  The executive of the organization will have been elected&#13;
by the membership through an open process and will&#13;
have demonstrated accountability through verifiable&#13;
reports.&#13;
Technical competence                            Ideally, the intermediary will have sufficient technical&#13;
know-how or experience to assist the community when&#13;
interacting with the contractor over project design&#13;
Deployment                                      The intermediary will be able to deploy field staff to&#13;
rural areas for extended and intensive community level&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
Social Strategy Matrix&#13;
Dissemination               To begin generating demand, PROSABAR should initiate public relations and&#13;
awareness raising for PROSABAR (and conditions) and communication through&#13;
printed material and mass media (local radio). Community interest in&#13;
PROSABAR could be generated by announcing local consultation meetings&#13;
between municipal government and community leaders to explain PROSABAR&#13;
and its conditionalities.&#13;
Community request           The capacity-building process begins by strengthening municipal governments'&#13;
ability to facilitate the consultative process through participatory meetings and&#13;
interpersonal communication skills. After the participatory consultation meetings&#13;
between municipal government and community leaders on PROSABAR&#13;
conditionalities, the community leaders should go back to the community to&#13;
explain PROSABAR conditionalities. The communities can then decide whether&#13;
to continue; if so, they submit a written request. The municipalities consolidate&#13;
the requests, analyze their potential, and send the requests to UNASBA.&#13;
UNASBA contracts an intermediary to work with communities under clear terms&#13;
of reference.&#13;
Pre-investment              The intermediary works with communities to establish:&#13;
* baseline data (social and demographic);&#13;
*  community organization (gender awareness);&#13;
* technical choice and cost recovery mechanisms;&#13;
*  agreement between communities and   municipal governments on&#13;
coparticipation;&#13;
that the community contributes 5 percent of costs and the municipal&#13;
government contributes 25 percent of costs;&#13;
Municipal governments send the package to UNASBA and the Social Investment&#13;
Fund, and the fund contracts construction.&#13;
Investment and construction  Construction begins with 30 percent (community and municipality) of total costs&#13;
according to technical options. Construction is supervised by the community and&#13;
intermediary. The intermediary continues the process of capacity-building by&#13;
performing management, administration, and accounting duties, as well as&#13;
hygiene education. The communication pilot project on attitudinal change begins.&#13;
Post-construction           *   Municipal government and UNASBA approve the scheme after three or&#13;
four months.&#13;
* The intermediary continues capacity-building with the community,&#13;
providing financial management, operations and maintenance, and&#13;
supervision of scheme operators.&#13;
* Pilot communication initiative continues.&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Economic Analysis: Methodology and Results&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.     The economic rate of return was calculated by comparing the costs and benefits of household water&#13;
and sanitation services in two scenarios: one in which the project is implemented and one in which the&#13;
project is not implemented. All costs and benefits used in the analysis are expressed in constant prices of&#13;
April 1995. The financial prices were converted into economic prices by adjusting them for the impact of&#13;
taxes and subsidies. In addition, shadow prices for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.70. The shadow&#13;
price of the exchange rate was calculated at 0.95.&#13;
2.     One of the main characteristics of the PROSABAR projects is its demand driven character. The&#13;
rural population is given the choice to select from different technological options. Moreover, even in those&#13;
cases where technology options for water supply are completely dictated by the available water resources,&#13;
communities will have the possibility to choose from different service levels, which include house&#13;
connections, standpipes and handpumps. For all these technology options and service levels, costs and&#13;
benefits were calculated. Because each technical option has its own economic characteristics, and the mix&#13;
of subprojects to be financed under the project will be demand-driven, calculating the overall costs and&#13;
benefits of the total project is difficult. However, based on the experience gained in the Yacupaj pilot&#13;
project and the SIF-financed rural water supply and sanitation projects, we have developed a possible&#13;
configuration of the different technology options and service levels, which has been used to calculate the&#13;
costs and benefits of the total project.&#13;
3.     The demand for sanitary facilities appears to be more limited than that for water supply, especially&#13;
in low-density, small rural settlements. Although there are substantial health and environmental benefits&#13;
associated with the improvement of sanitary facilities, it is quite likely that demand for this type of services&#13;
has to be generated through an extensive process of education and information. In the calculation of the&#13;
costs and benefits of the total PROSABAR project, the costs and benefits associated with the different&#13;
sanitary options have been included.&#13;
B. Calculation of Project Benefits&#13;
4.     The economic justification for the project is based on the benefits it would generate in the form of&#13;
time savings, health benefits, productivity and institutional benefits. The implementation of the&#13;
PROSABAR project will make water available closer to where households need it. Thus, households can&#13;
substantially reduce the time needed to travel to and from water resources. These time savings from&#13;
improved water supplies are a major benefit, especially for the women as hauling water is primarily their&#13;
responsibility. Distances to water sources vary considerably. In the Yacupaj project, rural dwellers had to&#13;
haul water over distances up to 9 km. Currently, rural households spend on average almost one hour per&#13;
day on fetching water. It is obvious that time savings vary considerably depending on the service level that&#13;
the conmmunities will select. One of the major problems in estimating time savings is the lack of reliable&#13;
data with regard to the consumption of water. This problem is aggravated by the fact that water&#13;
consumption patterns in Bolivia substantially differ between climatic zones. In the Altiplano, water&#13;
consumption could be as low as 5 lcd, whereas in the milder valleys water consumption could be close to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
20 to 25 lcd. It has therefore been assumed that households consume on average 15 lcd. The value of time&#13;
savings for the economic analysis is based on the assumption, that women can use the time savings by&#13;
diverting their time to productive activities. Economically productive work, such as farming, livestock&#13;
maintenance and cottage industries is valued at the wage rate in rural communities which is given at Bs. 10&#13;
per day. This wage rate is adjusted as it is assumed that only 60 percent of the time savings can be used&#13;
productively against the prevailing rural wage rate. Subsequently, this wage rate is converted into an&#13;
economic rural wage rate.&#13;
5.     There are also health benefits associated with improved water supply and sanitation. The major&#13;
disease related to inadequate water supplies and sanitation are diarrheas that primarily affect children under&#13;
5 years old. The health benefits which have been calculated only involve the health benefits that affect&#13;
young children. The impact of improved water supply on the number of episodes of diarrheaic diseases of&#13;
children under 5 years old will depend on the service level chosen. In the case of standpipes and&#13;
handpumps, the number of episodes will decline, but the decrease will be limited because water still has to&#13;
be hauled over a certain distance. Based on the results from an evaluation study of the Yacupay pilot&#13;
project, episodes of diarrhea will decline by about 50 to 55 percent for handpumps and standpipes. The&#13;
number of episodes will decrease by about 90 percent in the case of house connections'.&#13;
6.     The first health benefit relates to saved lives. Each year, about 15,000 children under five years old&#13;
die of diarrhea2. For each technology and service level, infant mortality due to diarrheal diseases has been&#13;
calculated. A second benefit relates to the cases of diarrhea wvhich are registered in hospital and health&#13;
posts and are subsequently treated. The number of cases actually treated in hospitals and health posts is&#13;
low. The costs associated with this treatment is calculated at Bs.60. These costs do not include transport&#13;
cost to and from the hospital or health post, and therefore underestimate the actual health benefits. A third&#13;
benefit relates to the costs of diarrhea that do not receive formal treatment, but involve medical costs&#13;
anyway. According to the already-mentioned evaluation study that took place in a number of communities&#13;
that were served by the Yacupaj pilot project, about 68 percent of the households used ORS (Oral&#13;
Rehydration Salts) or similar type of treatments to cure diarrheas. The costs of ORS are estimated at about&#13;
Bs.1.50 per episode.&#13;
7.     In the Yacupaj evaluation study, 12.7 percent of the households used the increased availability of&#13;
water for horticultural purposes. The size of the plot used for horticulture, and hence the productivity&#13;
benefits it will generate, is dependent of the technology and service level chosen. The produce has been&#13;
valued against financial product prices that have been converted into economic prices.&#13;
8.     The institutional strengthening program would generate long-term institutional benefits as&#13;
communities and municipalities learn to operate and maintain water and sanitation infrastructure. A large&#13;
number of community operators would be trained and certified (annex 18). It is assumed that these&#13;
operators will benefit individually from this training program as their position in the rural labor market&#13;
would improve. It is assumed that the average income of these certified community operators is 50 percent&#13;
higher than that of unskilled rural labor.&#13;
9.     The project would also foster a number of non-quantifiable benefits. The unavailability of reliable&#13;
data, however, has precluded a quantitative estimation of these benefits. They include improved water&#13;
quality, and benefits associated with the institutional strengthening of the capacity of communities and&#13;
I This figures is consistenit withl the average incidence of diarriheal diseases in areas with highi piped water supply coverage.&#13;

municipalities to plan and manage their water supply and sanitation services. Increased water quality does&#13;
not only relate to quality in terms of taste, clarity and odor, but also refers to the increased reliability of&#13;
water supply services. Moreover, the institutional strengthening program could also have a positive impact&#13;
on the implementation of other rural development projects.&#13;
C. Project Cost&#13;
10.    The investment costs of water supply and sanitation schemes include domestically and&#13;
internationally produced materials and equipment, unskilled and skilled labour, overhead cost and the cost&#13;
of pre-investment. The latter includes amongst other the costs of technical designs and community&#13;
mobilization. The investment costs of the different technology options have been adjusted in view of the&#13;
experiences of NGOs involved in the sector and the Social Investment Fund. The investment costs vary for&#13;
each technology option, whereas the population density of the area in which the project will be implemented&#13;
is also a major determinant of the operation and maintenance cost (Annex 5). In the investment cost a&#13;
service fee for the Social Investment Fund is also included, which will cover the costs for the technical and&#13;
financial evaluation of the pre-investments, and the technical supervision of the investments. This fee has&#13;
been estimated at 10 percent of construction costs. In addition, the investment cost for the institutional&#13;
strengthening program has been included.&#13;
11.    Operation and maintenance costs have been based on engineers' estimates. These costs include&#13;
operational costs, administration costs and maintenance costs. In gravity systems, operation and&#13;
maintenance costs are about 3.3 percent of investment costs, but for standpipes the operation and&#13;
maintenance costs are only 2.6 percent of total investment costs. Pumped systems are in general more&#13;
expensive due to the high cost of electricity. In concentrated areas, operation and maintenance costs make&#13;
up 4.5 percent of total investment costs. In semi-dispersed areas, the lack of economies of scale becomes&#13;
obvious and operation and maintenance costs increase to 5.5 percent. Handpumps are a low-cost&#13;
technology and operation and maintenance costs (excluding replacement of pumps) are less than 1 percent&#13;
of total investment costs.&#13;
D. Internal Economic Rate of Return&#13;
D. I   Individual Projects with Different Technology Options and Service Levels&#13;
12.    The evaluation of the economic viability of the project includes benefits from time savings, health&#13;
benefits and productivity increases, the total investment costs (including the institutional strengthening&#13;
program), and operation and maintenance costs projected for the period under review. A discount rate of 10&#13;
percent is used to calculate the net present value resulting from the project. To reflect true costs and&#13;
benefits, financial prices have been transformed into economic prices. Investment and operation and&#13;
maintenance costs are adjusted for the impact of subsidies and taxes, and shadow prices have been used.&#13;
13.    All water supply options, except for pumped systems with house connections in semi-dispersed&#13;
areas and spring protection without tap or standpipe, are viable projects at the individual level.3 Hence,&#13;
pumped systems with house connections in semi-dispersed areas and spring protection without a tap or&#13;
standpipe are not recommended to be used as they are in general not economically viable. In all other&#13;
3 It should be noted however, that pumped systems witl house connections under a different set of assumptions, e.g. with&#13;
regard to the distance to the original water source, could become a viable optioni, whereas spring protection without a tap&#13;
includes some healtlh benefits which could not be estimated due to lack of data.&#13;

cases, the options generate high internal rates of return. The results also indicate that handpumps generate&#13;
very high levels of return, especially the locally manufactured handpumps.&#13;

D.2     Total PROSABAR Project&#13;
14.    The total project consists of a large number of subprojects, both at the community and the&#13;
individual household level (i.e., latrines). The total cost of this project amounts to US$48 million&#13;
(including the institutional strengthening component). Based on engineer's estimates, a distribution of the&#13;
total investment funds over the different technology options has been made. Before project implementation,&#13;
it is assumed that 27 percent of total infrastructure investment funds wvill be directed to sanitation. The&#13;
remainder will be aimed at improvements in water supply. It is obvious, that the application of investment&#13;
funds over the different technology options and service levels could change due to the demand exercised by&#13;
the communities. The project investments will be implemented over a period of six years. It is obvious that&#13;
a cost-benefit analysis that will include all the costs related to water supply and sanitation investments and&#13;
the institutional strengthening program, but only captures part of the benefits will result in relatively low&#13;
values of net present value and internal rate of return. Such a calculation can therefore be seen as a&#13;
minimum or base case scenario.&#13;
15.    The net present value of the water supply component of the project is Bs.77 million, while the&#13;
internal rate of return is 23 percent, and the benefit-cost ratio 1.74. The net present value of the overall&#13;
project (including sanitation investments and institutional strengthening program) is Bs.3 1 million, the&#13;
internal rate of return is 13 percent, and the benefit-cost ratio is 1. 19.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
D.3    Sensitivity analysis&#13;
16.    In the sensitivity analysis the impact of a number of variables has been tested. These variables&#13;
comprise the impact of cost overruns, project delays, lower time savings, the impact of health benefits, and&#13;
the impact of productivity benefits, the impact of the service fee for the Social Investment Fund.&#13;
17.    Impact of cost overruns. The project's sensitivity to cost overruns has been tested. The switch&#13;
value (i.e., value when the project turns not viable) for cost overruns of total investment is about 19&#13;
percent. If investment costs increase by more than 19 percent, the project will turn out to be not&#13;
economically viable.&#13;
18.    Impact of project delays. When the project is delayed by one year, the net present value will&#13;
decrease to Bs.24 million, the internal rate of return will be 13 percent, while the benefit-cost ratio will be&#13;
1.16.&#13;
19.    Impact of changes in time savings. One of the uncertainties in the calculation of the time savings&#13;
is the wage rate of women in rural communities. In the base case scenario, it is assumed that 60 percent of&#13;
the time savings could be used productively against the prevailing wage rate. The switch value for daily&#13;
rural wages for women is Bs.4.67. Hence, if less than 47 percent of the time savings can be valued against&#13;
the rural wage rate, the project loses its viability.&#13;
20.    Impact of lower health benefits. Data on the direct relationship between morbidity and mortality&#13;
reduction and improved water supply services are rather scattered. For the sensitivity analysis, it has been&#13;
assumed that the incidence of diarrheal diseases is not affected by improved water supply and sanitation&#13;
and hence no health benefits are generated. Without health benefits, the net present value is Bs. 16 million.&#13;
The internal rate of return is 12 percent, and the benefit-cost ratio will be 1.10.&#13;
21.    Impact of lower productivity benefits. Data on the productive use of water for horticultural&#13;
purposes has been only documented in the evaluation study of the Yacupay pilot project. However,&#13;
when none of the households will use the increased water consumption for productive purposes instead&#13;
of the 12.7 percent found in the Yacupaj evaluation study, the project still maintains its validity. In the&#13;
absence of productivity benefits, the net present value is Bs. 11 million, the internal rate of return is 11&#13;
percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.07.&#13;
22.   Impact of SIF service fee. The service fee for the Social Investment Fund has been estimated at&#13;
10 percent of the direct construction cost. However, if the SIF could increase its efficiency in carrying&#13;
out its services to a level comparable to that of more efficient social investment funds, the project&#13;
feasibility would increase significantly. The most efficient social investment funds charge service fees&#13;
of 5 percent of investment cost. In the case of a service fee of 5 percent, the net present value of the&#13;
project would increase to Bs.41 million, and the internal rate of return would rise to 14 percent.&#13;
23.    Impact of changes in institutional benefits. When the income of trained community operators&#13;
increases by 100 percent, the net present value of the project increases to Bs.48 million, and the&#13;
internal rate of return will be 15 percent.&#13;
24.    Impact of consumer surplus. Little is known about the current water consumption pattern in rural&#13;
areas that have already been provided with water supply systems. Data are scattered, and usually more&#13;
based on impressions than actual investigations. Because of the problems with data accuracy, results have&#13;
been tested in a different way too. A constant price-elasticity demand curve for the different types of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
techr.ologies and service levels was estimated using data from other countries. The price elasticity of&#13;
demand for house connections has been estimated at -0.30, for spring protection and/or standpipes at -0.40&#13;
and for handpumps at -0.704. Based on this methodology, the net present value of the project is Bs.35&#13;
million, the internal rate of return is 14 percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.22. Table 7 shows the results&#13;
of this methodology. The cash payments of the rural dwellers have been used as a proxy for direct-use&#13;
benefits. These cash payments include the operation and maintenance costs. In addition, the consumer&#13;
surplus has been calculated. This methodology results in a higher net present value than the base case&#13;
scenario. The difference is due to the fact that the base case approach does not cover all benefits of the&#13;
project but is limited to time savings, health benefits and productivity increases, while the calculation based&#13;
on the demand curve should include all project benefits.&#13;
E. Cost Recovery&#13;
E. I   Long-Run Average Incremental Costs&#13;
25.    Incremental costs in water supply and sewerage systems result from new investment and the&#13;
operation and maintenance of this additional capacity. Investment or capacity costs for water supply&#13;
consist of investments for institutional development (including community mobilization), and the&#13;
construction of piped and non-piped water systems. In some cases, old systems will be rehabilitated.&#13;
Rehabilitation investments are considered equivalent to investments in water intake. Systems which require&#13;
rehabilitation are characterized by rationing. Rehabilitation will therefore result in increased water supply.&#13;
For sanitation, capacity costs include investments for the construction of sewerage systems in concentrated&#13;
areas and the construction of latrines in semi-dispersed and dispersed areas. Total capacity costs are equal&#13;
to the sum of capacity investment costs and incremental operation and maintenance costs. The net present&#13;
value of these costs is calculated using an assumed opportunity cost of 10 percent.&#13;
26.    Long-run average incremental costs have been calculated as the ratio of the sum of the present&#13;
value of capacity costs, plus incremental operating and maintenance costs to the sum of present values of&#13;
the incremental volume of water. The long-run average incremental costs are computed based on&#13;
incremental water consumption. For sewerage and latrines, the average incremental costs are calculated at&#13;
an annual basis on a household level.&#13;
4 In a study in Nepal, the price elasticity for gravity (or spring protection) schemes was estimated at around -0.40; whereas for&#13;
handpumps, price elasticity ranged from about -0.60 to -0.72. The price elasticity for house connections is based on earlier&#13;
studies for urban water supply in Latin America. However, as this service level shall only be provided in peri-urban areas,&#13;
the use of this price elasticity value seems justified.&#13;

a/ Proposed tariff is the tariff that at least covers the operation and maintenance cost of the technology option&#13;
selected. It does not include the cash and in-kind contribution to investments.&#13;
b/ Cost recovery index includes the operation and maintenance cost plus the communities' contribution to&#13;
investment (i.e., 20 percent of investment, of which 5 percent in cash and 15 percent in kind). The better&#13;
performance of low-cost technologies in cost recovery is due to the definition of the proposed tariff. For the&#13;
pumped systems and handpump options, the proposed tariff does not include only operation and maintenance&#13;
costs, but also the replacement of the pump which is a major deterrninant in the total cost.&#13;
c/ This figure does not include the cost of hauling for these alternatives.&#13;
27.     Table 2 shows that in none of the water supply options is full cost recovery being implemented.&#13;
The customary proposed tariffs meet the operation and maintenance cost of the systems. However, the&#13;
tariffs do not generate sufficient resources to enable communities and/or municipalities to replace&#13;
investments after their useful life. It is evident, that the lack of cost recovery will jeopardize the long-term&#13;
sustainability of the water supply systems. Lack of cost recovery has two major drawbacks. First, if only&#13;
operation and maintenance costs are charged, communities will choose piped water systems which have in&#13;
general low operation and maintenance cost systems. Although table 2 shows, that operation and&#13;
maintenance costs for handpumps are lower than that of piped systems, this calculation does not include the&#13;
costs associated with hauling water. If these costs are included, the price per cubic meter water could&#13;
increase by Bs.2 to 3. In addition, if only operation and maintenance costs are taking into account the&#13;
communities with handpumps pay a higher proportion of the total cost of water services than communities&#13;
with piped systems as is shown in table 2. Because it is likely that communities that opt for handpumps are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-&#13;
poorer than those selecting more capital-intensive water supply systems, this approach has some equity&#13;
implications. Hence, the importance the project assigns to full cost recovery (Annex 6).&#13;

28.    Table 3 shows that cost recovery in conventional sewerage is a major problem with the proposed&#13;
tariffs. The proposed tariff, that comprises the operation and maintenance cost, covers only 13 percent of&#13;
the total costs. The performance of latrines in cost recovery is significantly better. If the investment&#13;
contribution is included, the difference between low- and high-cost technologies is considerably smaller.&#13;
Just as has been previously observed in water supply projects, the communities which opt for low-cost&#13;
technologies end up paying a higher proportion of total cost than the communities which select conventional&#13;
sewerage.&#13;
E. 2   Cost Recovery and Ability to Pay&#13;
29.    It is difficult to determine the capacity to pay for water and sanitation services, especially in rural&#13;
areas. Income data are only scarcely available. In addition, the seasonality of income and the importance of&#13;
subsistence income further complicate the estimation of the ability to pay. The latter will require flexibility&#13;
with regard to the payment of tariffs.&#13;

30.     In table 4, the ability to pay for the different technology options has been determined using an&#13;
average cash income of US$ 40 per month per household -- equivalent to an annual per capita cash income&#13;
of US$ 96.&#13;
31.    With the current proposed tariffs, the operation and maintenance costs customary for the different&#13;
options do not differ substantially. Especially not, when for handpumps and standpipes the economic cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
of hauling water are included. Rural communities have the ability to pay for all technology options and&#13;
service levels offered if only the operation and maintenance costs of these services are charged. As ability&#13;
to pay is lower than the often used rule of thumb of 5 percent (i.e, households should not spend more than 5&#13;
percent of their cash household income on water and sanitation services), possibilities exists to increase the&#13;
proposed tariffs accordingly. The table also shows that full cost recovery can be achieved for low-cost&#13;
technologies. However, subsidies will be needed to ensure the sustainability of piped water systems.&#13;
Policy Implications&#13;
32.    Cost recovery in rural water and sanitation projects is a key issue. If users of water and sanitation&#13;
investments do not pay the full cost of these services, the long-term sustainability of these services is&#13;
jeopardized. Therefore the project will pursue a full cost recovery. The project finances a study that will&#13;
develop a cost recovery policy for the rural water and sanitation sector based on field studies that will be&#13;
conducted during the first two years of project implementation. Table 5 shows the policy options for cost&#13;
recovery in the rural water and sanitation sector. It suggests that there are two policy options with regard to&#13;
cost recovery: full or partial cost recovery. It indicates the implications of each policy option, and assesses&#13;
the respective roles of central government, municipalities and user conmuunities.&#13;

*   recovery of only O&amp;M cost will have equity&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
1.    Investment for the first year of project implementation, 1995, was selected during project&#13;
preparation in specific municipalities of the departments of Potosi, Chuquisaca, La Paz, and Cochabamba.&#13;
These departments and municipalities were chosen based on poverty indicators, including a five-year infant&#13;
mortality rate above 80 per 1,000 live births and an illiteracy rate above 50 percent. Focusing the first year&#13;
of project implementation on departments located in the Altiplano was critical for efficient use of human&#13;
and financial resources, and for applying the lessons learned from the Potosi pilot project.&#13;
2.     For the subsequent years of the project, 1996-2000, all departments and municipalities could be&#13;
eligible for financing if they meet the following criteria. These criteria will be revised annually during&#13;
project review by DINASBA/PROSABAR, the project committee, and IDA, to incorporate adjustments if&#13;
they are required following the flexible approach to project design outlined in paragraph 20 of the Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report.&#13;
Departments&#13;
3.     Entry criteria. Eligibility of new departments will be decided during the annual project review.&#13;
From the second year of project implementation any department is eligible for financing if the&#13;
corresponding departmental government complies with the following criteria:&#13;
*  The organization of the UNASBA and the appointment of the minimum staff required to manage the&#13;
PROSABAR under stable labor conditions, and with qualifications satisfactory to&#13;
DINASBA/PROSABAR. Staff includes a manager, one engineer, one social worker, and support staff.&#13;
*  The signing of an agreement with the Sub-Secretariat of Urban Affairs, the Sub-Secretariat of Public&#13;
Investment and Extemal Financing, and the Social Investment Fund for project implementation.&#13;
*  For 1995, the commitment of at least US$ 100,000 in the approved budget from the previous year to&#13;
finance pre-investments, normally scheduled for September of each year. These funds should be&#13;
deposited in a separate bank account managed by UNASBA, and are subject to project auditing&#13;
procedures.&#13;
*  Starting in 1996, pre-investment activities will be financed by Regional and Municipal Governments&#13;
and external resources (NGOs and others). These funds should ideally be deposited into the UNASBA&#13;
account in order to ensure standardized project preparation procedures and quality control.&#13;
4.     Exit criteria. During project review compliance with these criteria will be revised as follows:&#13;
*  A minimum staff, equivalent to at least fifty staff-months a year, has been allocated to PROSABAR&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
*  A satisfactory amount has been contracted out to prepare subprojects.&#13;
*  A satisfactory statement on the use of the project account has been prepared.&#13;
5.     If performance at the department level is not considered satisfactory by DINASBA/PROSABAR&#13;
and IDA, the financing of additional subprojects in the department and the provision of technical assistance&#13;
to UNASBA could be stopped, after consultation with the project committee. In such an event&#13;
PROSABAR would withdraw from the department after concluding projects whose implementation already&#13;
had started. PROSABAR would withdraw with the staff it had assigned and the equipment it had allocated&#13;
to the UNASBA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
Municipalities&#13;
6.     After the first year of investment, all municipalities will be eligible for financing under the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
* Presentation to UNASBA of a batch of subprojects for at least 10 communities.&#13;
* Subprojects have been included in the municipal operating plan for the year.&#13;
* The plan has been cleared by the department and the central government.&#13;
* Pre-investment funds are available.&#13;
* The municipality agrees to a cash contribution of at least 20 percent of project cost, according to the&#13;
financial policy for the sector.&#13;
* There are assurances that cash contributions from the community will be obtained on time.&#13;
7.    If performance at the municipal level is not considered satisfactory by DINASBA/PROSABAR&#13;
and IDA, the financing of additional subprojects and the provision of technical assistance to the&#13;
municipality could be stopped, after consultation with the project committee. In such an event PROSABAR&#13;
would withdraw from the municipality after concluding projects whose implementation already had started.&#13;
Communities&#13;
7.     Communities would be eligible according to the following criteria:&#13;
* The total population of the community is below 5,000.&#13;
* Priority has been assigned to a specific community by its corresponding municipality, and it has been&#13;
included in the municipal operating plan.&#13;
* A subproject has been prepared or funds to finance pre-investment have been identified.&#13;
* The community has selected the technology and service level, and is fully aware of cost implications&#13;
and financial contributions.&#13;
* The community is willing to contribute in cash with at least 5 percent of the project cost and 15 percent&#13;
in unskilled labor and local materials to the municipality.&#13;
* An agreement has been reached between community leaders and municipal authorities regarding project&#13;
implementation and financial contributions.&#13;
* The community knows the government policy for rural water and sanitation.&#13;
Subprojects&#13;
8.     A project is eligible if it:&#13;
* Meets all previous criteria.&#13;
* Follows the participatory process established by the Popular Participation Law.&#13;
* Is demand oriented, that is, reflects the desires and willingness to pay of the community.&#13;
* Is accompanied by a community training and education process, developed by UNASBA and funded by&#13;
the technical assistance program.&#13;
* Has been prepared based on the design manual of DINASBA for rural water and sanitation projects.&#13;
*  Has been satisfactorily evaluated by the Social Investment Fund.&#13;
* Has been approved by the Board of the Social Investment Fund.&#13;

Annex 15&#13;
Reporting&#13;
1.     Reporting is a key feature for any project to formalize communications to interested parties and&#13;
stakeholders. It should include, as a minimum: (i) the progress of the project measured by pre-established&#13;
indicators; (ii) explanations regarding deviations from original project conception; and, (iii) alternative&#13;
courses of actions and decisions to adjust project implementation when required and justified. Reporting&#13;
will be responsibility of PROSABAR, that will collect the necessary information from all of the&#13;
participating institutions (UNASBAs and SIF).&#13;
2.     This project has been designed to be responsive to community demands for different technology&#13;
options and service levels. There are therefore no blue-prints for detailed project execution-except for the&#13;
first year--but project implementation procedures and policies that should be followed and principles for&#13;
selecting sub-projects, which in turn might be reviewed periodically. Project design relies on the lessons&#13;
learned in the earlier phases of project execution to guide the planning and implementation of subsequent&#13;
activities (annex 6). In such a project, reporting becomes an essential feature for project design and&#13;
decision making.&#13;
3.     The guidelines for report preparation are the following:&#13;
* Frequency and timing: annual reports to be presented by November 30 of each year, starting in 1995.&#13;
* Preparation: stand-alone reports based on the quarterly evaluations prepared by February 28, May&#13;
31, and August 31. Quarterly evaluations should be made available to IDA upon request.&#13;
*  Review and approval: reports should be reviewed by the Project Committee and approved by the&#13;
Head of the PROSABAR.&#13;
4.     Content of the annual report:&#13;
I. Project description. Summary of the project in 2 pages.&#13;
II. Monitoring indicators. Quarterly comparison of indicators--proposed vs. actual--discussion and&#13;
proposed adjustments. Tables and accumulated graphs should be developed, comparing actual and&#13;
planned performance.&#13;
III. Institutional component. Progress of each component indicating funds committed, disbursed, and&#13;
results to date.&#13;
IV. Next year planning. Based on actual commitments from municipalities and communities, and the&#13;
inventory of pre-investment, a forecast for the following year activities should be presented, including&#13;
detailed budgets for institutional support to PROSABAR and UNASBAs.&#13;
V. Critical activities. All critical activities, events or decisions should be highlighted.&#13;
VI. Recommendations. A summary of main recommendations should be included, including actions&#13;
required, and key decisions to be made.&#13;
VII. Annexes.&#13;
a) Communities. A list of communities included in the project, classified according to implementation&#13;
cycle: community request, project approved, contract signed for construction, contract signed for&#13;
software, construction underway, provisional transfer, final transfer, software completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
b) Training. A list of persons trained at community, municipal, regional, and central level. Training for&#13;
operators/administrators should be particularly highlighted. Information should be presented indicating&#13;
training description, timing, and duration.&#13;
c) Financial information. Should include--at least--an update of financial information provided in the&#13;
SAR. It should also data on the structure and amount of SIF's administrative costs and the fee charged&#13;
by SIF for the provision of its services..&#13;
d) Contracts. Should include a list of contracts awarded indicating the name of contractor/consultants,&#13;
the value in bolivianos and dollars, the date of signature, and the status of implementation.&#13;
e) Project accounts. Should include summary reconciled-statements of all project accounts.&#13;
f) Credit covenants. Should include an updated evaluation of compliance with legal covenants.&#13;
g) Institutional Agreements. Should include an evaluation of usefulness and enforceability of key&#13;
institutional agreements, and requirements for further adjustments.&#13;
h) Workshops. A summary of main conclusions for each workshop, including main recommendations&#13;
and actions that have been agreed.&#13;
i) Monitoring indicators. Should include a summary evaluation of expanded monitoring indicators and&#13;
independent audits performed under M&amp;E component financed by the UNDP.&#13;
j) Project Review. Should include a tentative agenda and planning for the project review to be held&#13;
before year-end between government officials and IDA according to paragraph of the SAR.&#13;

            Bolivia - Rural Water and Sanitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Rural Water and Sanitation
            Project's goal is to alleviate poverty in rural areas
            by enhancing productivity through improved health conditions
            and a more efficient use of the time saved collecting water.
            Specific objectives include: 1) increasing the coverage and
            sustainable use of water and sanitation services in rural
            communities and municipalities; 2) assisting the local water
            and sanitation units in developing the capacity to provide
            technical assistance to municipal governments and local
            communities; 3) supporting the sustainability of water and
            sanitation services through extensive training of
            community-level operators and administrators; and 4)
            strengthening the capacity of the National Directorate of
            Water and Sanitation (DINASBA) to formulate policies,
            prepare technical standards, and mobilize financial
            resources. The project consists of the following components:
            1) rural water and sanitation infrastructure program which
            includes 2 subcomponents: (a) water supply facilities and
            shallow wells with hand pumps and rainwater catchments; and
            (b) small-scale wastewater collection facilities, treatment
            and disposal systems, and latrines; and 2) institutional
            capacity-building program comprising 3 subcomponents: (a)
            financing of project management to assist the institutions
            in charge of project implementation; (b) financing of
            technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions and
            communities in their capacity to provide safe, reliable and
            sustainable water and sanitation services; and (c) training
            program that will fund training to stakeholders and
            institutions responsible for backstopping water and
            sanitation services.
