                        Aldewereld, Siem/Simon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Dr. Robert W. Oliver, California Institute of&#13;
Technology, on 1985-11-02&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld briefly covers his pre-Bank career, how he joined the&#13;
Bank in '46 as assistant to Crena de Iongh, the first Treasurer of the&#13;
Bank, his first assignment to set up a disbursement system for loans&#13;
not yet made, and with Crena de Iongh jointly developing ideas to&#13;
obtain the cooperation of commercial banks for the disbursement of the&#13;
proceeds of loans; incorporated in the Disbursement Procedures forming&#13;
part of the Loan Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In 1952, Aldewereld transferred to projects where he stayed until&#13;
George Woods came to the Bank and asked him to take responsibility for&#13;
financial policy. From 1952-63 he served as Director of Projects,&#13;
which, until that time, was divided between the then Loan and&#13;
Economics departments. The 1952 reorganization, of which Bill Iliff&#13;
was in charge, saw the birth of the Projects Department. As its&#13;
Director, he organized the Department into several functional&#13;
divisions as well as introduced project evaluation in a comprehensive&#13;
manner. Aldewereld also discusses the relative roles of the IMF and&#13;
the World Bank and, in that context, the UNCTAD proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aldewereld gives a brief assessment of Presidents Eugene Meyer&#13;
and John McCloy, and a more detailed assessment of presidents Eugene&#13;
Black and George Woods. Specifically, Black's great contribution in&#13;
establishing the market in the U.S. for World Bank bonds, raising&#13;
funds first in the U.S. and later in capital markets outside the U.S.,&#13;
expanding lending operations, and George Woods broadening and&#13;
increasing Bank activities. Most notably, in Brazil where he&#13;
&amp;#12;negotiated a resumption of lending after differences of views on&#13;
policy and procedural problems had resulted in reducing lending to a&#13;
trickle. He concludes in discussing IDA during the Woods era&#13;
[established in 1960 prior to the arrival of Woods]. Finally,&#13;
according to Aldewereld, although the creditworthiness obstacle was&#13;
removed with IDA the stringent standards to which the money should be&#13;
used and the protective covenants remained identical.&#13;

            In November 1985, Siem Aldewereld was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Dr. Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1946 to 1974, Mr. Aldewereld worked in the
            following areas: as assistant to the treasurer of the World
            Bank; in the department of technical operations as assistant
            director (1952-1955) and as director (1955-1972); as vice
            president of the World Bank and the International
            Development Association (IDA) (1965-1968); in the projects
            department as director (1968-1969); and as vice president of
            finance (1969-1974). His transcript concerns his work as
            director when he organized the department of technical
            operations into several functional divisions and introduced
            project evaluations in a comprehensive manner. He also
            discusses the relative roles of the International Monetary
            Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in the context of the United
            Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
            proposal to ease the creditworthiness of borrowing countries.
