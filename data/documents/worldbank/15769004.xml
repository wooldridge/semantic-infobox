&amp;#12;     Country case-study 1:&#13;
     Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s forward-thinking innovation policy&#13;
&#13;
     The Korean economy has been transformed&#13;
     from a producer and exporter of low-/mid-&#13;
     tech commodities to a high-tech, ICT-orient-&#13;
     ed industrial power. Korea has established&#13;
     world prominence in technology areas such&#13;
     as semi-conductors, electronics, mobile&#13;
     handsets, displays, automobiles, steel, and&#13;
     shipbuilding, among many others.&#13;
&#13;
     In the Korean case, public support for R&amp;D&#13;
     is a clear feature of the success story. The&#13;
     strength of innovation strategy lay in it being&#13;
     part of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s overall recovery plan&#13;
     and economic structural adjustment. This&#13;
     ensured innovation policy cut across eco-&#13;
     nomic policy and was framed in a long-term&#13;
     perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     When the downturn first hit in the 1990s, public support included:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   The government initiated massive R&amp;D investments and launched specialized diverse policy programs to&#13;
          promote the ICT industry as a new source growth in response to the declining growth potential of na-&#13;
          tional innovation. It established the ICT Promotion Fund which mobilized 1-1.5 billion dollars every year&#13;
          for investment in ICT R&amp;D and innovation.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Strengthened governance through the creation of the Ministry of Information and Communication.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   The provision of necessary innovation infrastructure through the launch of a ten-year Information Infra-&#13;
          structure Initiative to lay a foundation for ICT industry.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   Various incentive programs, including tax deduction programs, R&amp;D subsidies, loan programs, informa-&#13;
          tion services, technical and legal consulting services, among others, have been offered to promote R&amp;D&#13;
          and innovation in the private sectors.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	   A regulatory framework to meet the requirements of the new trade regime. The new trade regime also&#13;
          provided an enabling environment for innovation through measures including the liberalization&#13;
          of trade and investments, strengthening of IPR protection, and realignment of the subsidy programs for&#13;
          industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This was a relatively forward-thinking policy at the time for the region and Korea benefitted from significant&#13;
     first mover advantage. Perhaps this presents a lesson for new policies in that while they should provide cer-&#13;
     tain common conditions for innovation through long-term policy in order to capitalize the potential of innova-&#13;
     tion, policies should also think about how they can be pioneering.&#13;
&#13;
     The 1997 East Asian Financial Crisis hit the science and technology sectors hard in Korea. The government&#13;
     responded to this in two ways: first the government increased the R&amp;D budget in order to make up for the&#13;
     expected decline in R&amp;D activities in the private sectors: most of the increased fund was used for SMEs and&#13;
     ICT sectors; and second the government took a broad range of reforms in both public and private sectors to&#13;
     enhance the efficiency of the economy.&#13;
&#13;
     These reforms brought about big changes in many sectors of the economy, such as in business structures,&#13;
     business practices and through increased transparency in public sectors, to name a few. What is most notable,&#13;
     though, was the level of increased entrepreneurship among young people in Korea. New technology-based&#13;
     start-ups mushroomed around the end of the 1990s, which helped lead to a quick financial recovery. The&#13;
     number of new start-ups increased from about 2000 in 1998 to over 11,000 in 2001. This phenomenon was&#13;
     led by young people in the ICT sectors taking advantage of the new regulatory framework and support for&#13;
     SME creation.&#13;

                                                      the crisis hinged upon the notion of how wealth is created: innovation&#13;

                                                 Based on this notion of wealth creation, innovation was seen by the&#13;

     universities decreased; and the private venture market for innovation was frozen. The government responded&#13;

&amp;#12;Country case-study 3:&#13;
Croatiaâ&#128;&#153;s political commitment to innovation&#13;
&#13;
      The World Economic Forum (2010) classifies Bulgaria and Romania as economies in the stage of&#13;
      efficiency-driven growth and Croatia and Poland in a transition stage from efficiency- to innovation-&#13;
      driven economic growth. In terms of global competitiveness, Croatia ranked behind the other three&#13;
      countries, at 77th, by the World Economic Forum in its 2011 Global Competitive Rankings.&#13;
&#13;
      Croatia faces key challenges in the transition to an innovation-driven economy, primarily centered on&#13;
      issues of commercialization. These key challenges include: low commercialization of research results&#13;
      generated by public research organizations (PROs); poor collaboration between PROs and compa-&#13;
      nies; low level of private investments in R&amp;D and poor governance of national innovation policies.&#13;
&#13;
      As the crisis hit, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s original policy response was to address public budget constraints.&#13;
      Public budget cuts, however, were coupled with reducing funding needs through the introduction of&#13;
      impact assessment strategies and an emphasis on targeted support and incentives for SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
      Following a World Bank loan of â&#130;¬30m for the development of a National Innovation System, Croatia&#13;
      has been able to focus policy on those areas in which the countryâ&#128;&#153;s innovation system faces particular&#13;
      challenges, namely enabling R&amp;D institutions to commercialize research outputs and R&amp;D activities&#13;
      to develop, adapt, commercialize and use technology (Marijanovic, D. et al.).&#13;
&#13;
      A necessary prerequisite for this policy change was political commitment centered on three pillars:&#13;
      an excellent scientific research base; appropriate funding sources; and adequate business and tech-&#13;
      nological infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
      In terms of technological infrastructure and adequate funding sources, for example, the government&#13;
      set up the TEHCRO â&#128;&#147; building innovation &amp; business infrastructure funding program. Through the&#13;
      Croatian Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (BICRO), the program provides funding&#13;
      for the establishment of Science &amp; Technology Parks, Incubators and Centers of Competence (R&amp;D&#13;
      Centers), as well as post-establishment growth funding for these innovation centers. TEHCRO con-&#13;
      tributes up to fifty per cent of total project costs over five years, in the form of grants, soft loans and&#13;
      equity investments. Involvement of a technology provider is a must and funding is provided through&#13;
      a competitive procedure (i.e. through the evaluation of multi-annual business plans).&#13;
&#13;
      To secure long-term viability, the program builds in a requirement for self-sustainability after five&#13;
      years, providing financing on a declining scale until self-sustainability is reached. A system of gov-&#13;
      ernance is also built into the program through close monitoring of progress (in the form of quarterly&#13;
      reporting, on-site visits, mid-term evaluations, among others).&#13;
      Other challenges that came out of the round table discussion sessions on the country include: lack&#13;
      of continuity of funding and lack of funds; and difficulties in prioritization and resistance to change&#13;
      within existing structures. Broader market challenges included a lack of entrepreneurial skills and&#13;
      skilled management in science; a small market size and a lack of VC funding. As a result, suggested&#13;
      further policy responses that are needed to address these challenges are:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Establish governance across the innovation system by setting up monitoring systems and indica-&#13;
         tors. This provides a benchmark, against which priorities and change can be met and a mandate&#13;
         to enforce structural change.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Restructure higher education curricula, primarily through creating an advancement system for&#13;
         academics to address issues of specialized management structures.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Strengthen IP Law â&#128;&#147; a necessary prerequisite for any innovation economy, as it provides the basis&#13;
         on which innovative goods and knowledge can be traded.&#13;
&#13;
      Alongside these key aspects, policy response in Croatia, it was suggested, should also strengthen&#13;
      existing innovation support programs, introduce VC funding and raise public awareness.&#13;

       will be introduced, which will be subject to regular evaluation by external experts;&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Prioritizing scientific research in five areas that will concentrate 70 per cent of the national R&amp;D&#13;
       financing. This is expected to concentrate a critical mass of intellectual potential and scientific&#13;

       communities to take part in European Community initiatives;&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Strengthening the knowledge triangle through improvement of the institutional coordination and&#13;
       development of schemes for start-ups; availability of business angels; supporting the capacity of&#13;
       SMEs to absorb technologies and increased financing by the private sector in R&amp;D;&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Development of the scientific infrastructure through the establishment of regional partnership&#13;

&#13;
    The Action Plan for the national R&amp;D strategy for Bulgaria specifies the public authorities that are&#13;
    responsible for the implementation of each measure and introduces new instruments to be used for&#13;
    financing. Specific indicators are outlined that will be measured and reported by March 31st, 2014.&#13;

       â&#128;¢	   Broad based public support for innovation is essential to ensure country ownership of innovation policy reforms.&#13;
            Attractive costs, including a low corporate tax rate (10 per cent) and the lowest labor costs in European Union.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   The key contribution of a comprehensive innovation policy is not in putting forward new instruments for R&amp;D&#13;
            financing, but in ensuring cross-sector collaboration and coordination of policy agendas that facilitate local&#13;
            innovations.A skilled workforce and one of the highest proportions of students studying abroad in EU.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   The array of policy instruments that can be used to support innovation means that policy-making needs to be&#13;
            highly selective in choosing instruments that are most suitable for country context.Benefitting from having the EU&#13;
            as trading partner.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   The innovation policy will only achieve impact if government actions are predictable, but predictability does not&#13;
            mean that innovation policy is designed once and for all: it should be periodically reviewed and, if necessary, ad-&#13;
            justed, to changing conditions.A strengthened IP legislative system.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Focus on results and M&amp;E is critical for enabling the points above.&#13;

Country case-study 5: Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s structural adjustment&#13;
and innovation&#13;
&#13;
     Innovation played a central role in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ability to implement changes in its trade regime as&#13;
     part of its wider structural adjustment to export-led growth from import-substitution-led growth. Suc-&#13;
     ceeding in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s structural transformation into high-tech high-value added products played&#13;
     a central part in its story to export-led growth. The emergence of a new trade regime in the 1990s,&#13;
     calling upon Korea to revise policy programs designed to support an export-oriented growth strat-&#13;
     egy, added to the challenges Korea faced during the downturn of the 1990s. By being forced to sup-&#13;
     port the R&amp;D sector as private investment fell, and through the need to foster technology transfer to&#13;
     remain competitive in the shift to export-led growth, Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s innovation policy cut across its structural&#13;
     adjustment plan.&#13;
&#13;
     The regulatory framework to meet the requirements of the new trade regime favored an innovation&#13;
     economy, such as: liberalization of trade and investments; strengthening of IPR protection and re-&#13;
     alignment of the subsidy programs for industries provided an environment conducive to innovation.&#13;

      Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s successful response to the 1998 financial crisis is largely attributable to: (i) the visionary&#13;
      government committed to the innovation agenda; (ii) sustained investment in R&amp;D capacity, in-&#13;
      cluding institutional capacity since early 1960; and (iii) a large base of entrepreneurial-educated&#13;
      youth that created its vast SME innovation sector.&#13;
      The financial crisis of 1998 led to a dramatic decrease of business expenditures in R&amp;D â&#128;&#147; from 80 per&#13;
      cent of all R&amp;D expenditures in 1997 to 70 per cent in 1998. At the same time the crisis reduced job&#13;
      opportunities in large industrial firms, especially for recent university graduates. To counterbalance&#13;
      the effects of the crisis and tap into the large pool of young talent, the Korean government decided&#13;
      to increase its financial support for innovation, with a particular focus on SMEs and the ICT sector.&#13;
      This approach, combined with the corporate sector reforms and improvements in business transpar-&#13;
      ency, led to â&#128;&#156;new technology-based start-ups mushrooming around the end of the 1990sâ&#128;?, espe-&#13;
      cially in the ICT sector (Chung, S.). The number of new technology start-ups grew from about 2000 in&#13;
      1998 to 9,000 in 2000 and 11,000 in 2001, helping produce a quick financial recovery for the Korean&#13;
      economy (Chung, S.).&#13;
&#13;
      Switzerland has developed a sophisticated apprenticeship system that fosters an innovation&#13;
      economy. Having historically resisted European-wide changes in education systems that focus on&#13;
      tertiary university education, apprenticeship is still today in Switzerland the main form of education,&#13;
      as it was in the middle ages across much of Europe. About 70 per cent of 15-year-olds leave the&#13;
      full-time education system to go to an apprenticeship position in the real working world and it has&#13;
      become a societal commitment to find a job for everyone at this age. Professional education is seen&#13;
      as an equally important form of education and there is the opportunity to go on to university later,&#13;
      which is then usually undertaken part-time. â&#128;&#156;In Geneva, to be admitted to an apprenticeship as a ju-&#13;
      venile between the age of 16 and 19, is more selective and prestigious than to study at high school.&#13;
      It is not unusual in Switzerland that a president of a bank started his career as an apprentice in a&#13;
      bankâ&#128;? (Alkio, M.). The result is among the lowest unemployment rates (at only 2.7 per cent) among&#13;
      20-30-year olds in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
      These two systems may not be replicable in other country contexts, but they highlight the ef-&#13;
      fectiveness of forward-thinking policies tailored to country situations. The Korean model, for&#13;
      example, would not have been as effective if its large pool of unemployed young people in the&#13;
      1990s had not been through tertiary education and provided a specialized skills base. The Swiss ap-&#13;
      prenticeship system requires the full commitment of the private sector: it cannot be implemented&#13;
      by a ministry of education alone, â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦.especially small and medium companies, ready to take charge&#13;
      of the professional education of young people, with the risk that they will later work for the competi-&#13;
      tionâ&#128;? (DellÂ´Ambrogio, M.). This system is effective in Switzerland because of a certain cultural attitude&#13;
      that has historical roots in the system of guilds in the middle ages â&#128;&#147; a system Switzerland built upon,&#13;
      rather than rejected in historical periods of Europe-wide educational reform. Companies need to&#13;
      have a cultural attitude of competing with each other to assume the teaching of a future generation&#13;
      of skilled people in their field as a common mission and goal (DellÂ´Ambrogio, M.). The Swiss exam-&#13;
      ple also highlights the importance of knowledge sharing internationally: â&#128;&#156;40 per cent of professors&#13;
      in Swiss universities are foreign nationals, you have to integrate and tap into global knowledge to be&#13;
      successfulâ&#128;? (Alkio, M.).&#13;

Poland too, has a large labor pool,               Swiss universities are foreign&#13;
but this is largely unutilized due to a&#13;
mismatch between workforce skills                 nationals: you have to integrate&#13;
and the needs of employers. As a&#13;
result, Polandâ&#128;&#153;s policy should address&#13;
this skills gap, which is an obstacle&#13;

&#13;
      MARIBIC was established in 2008 as part of the Croatian Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s TEHCRO program. It was&#13;
      endowed with initial funds of â&#130;¬4.2m. The World Bank provided â&#130;¬1.8m (70 per cent grant, 30 per&#13;
      cent loan) and â&#130;¬2.4m was secured through the University of Dubrovnik, Croatia, in conjunction with&#13;
      BICRO and the Ministry of Science and Education.&#13;
&#13;
      Through its center for research, practical education and technology and innovation, MARIBIC pro-&#13;
      vides a vital link between the aquaculture industry and University-level theoretical education and&#13;
      science.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;MARIBIC provides continuous education and information about new technologies, trends, equip-&#13;
      ment, marketing, and about the problems shared by the local aquaculture industry and aquaculture&#13;
      producers. The center is also active in the scientific field, working with the University of Dubrovnik&#13;

      entific and development programsâ&#128;? http://maribic.com/.&#13;
&#13;
      Indeed, its mission is to fill the gap between science and education, and active and prospective&#13;
      aquaculture companies. It aids market development, by selecting locations which specifically require&#13;
      investment and technology transfer.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;MARIBICâ&#128;&#153;s mission is to become a missing link between scientific/educational institutions and active&#13;

      and student research, and in the development of the aquaculture industryâ&#128;? http://maribic.com/.&#13;
&#13;
      MARIBIC provides multi-level support for the mariculture industry in Croatia as a response to a&#13;
      market need for the consolidation and modernization of the industry. It enhances innovation infra-&#13;
      structure and production along the aquaculture value chain through facilities which include: specialist&#13;

Case-Study 2: New approach to promoting innovation&#13;
and R&amp;D in Bulgaria â&#128;&#147; the JEREMIE Holding Fund&#13;
&#13;
      A holding fund with capital of EUR 199 million will be registered under the JEREMIE Initiative, called&#13;
      the JEREMIE Holding Fund. The JEREMIE Holding Fund is foreseen to exist for 10 years with an op-&#13;
      tion of a further 2 more years, targeting SMEs that have their main economic activity in Bulgaria. It&#13;
      will manage funds on behalf of the Bulgarian government. Three funds for equity investments in the&#13;
      Bulgarian economy will be set up as part of the holding fund, namely, for small start-up companies&#13;
      (venture capital), for small companies in the process of development (growth equity), and a mixed&#13;
      instrument between equity investments and loans (mezzanine).&#13;
&#13;
      It is envisaged that the Fund for small start-up companies will begin operations with a capital of EUR&#13;
      30 million. EUR 21 million of this will be under the â&#128;&#156;JEREMIEâ&#128;?, the remaining amount will come from&#13;
      external financing. The Fund for small start-up companies will invest up to a ceiling of EUR 1.5 million&#13;
      annually in a business, while there is no such restriction for the other two funds. The other two funds&#13;
      will have a capital of EUR 60 million, half provided by JEREMIE and the other external funding must&#13;
      be secured by their future managers. Finding this extra financing will be one of the criteria for select-&#13;
      ing the risk fund managers.&#13;
&#13;
      Risk financing for businesses will benefit from a total of EUR 81 million in borrowed capital from&#13;
      the JEREMIE Initiative, while the amount will reach EUR 150 million with the external financing. The&#13;
      JEREMIE Program will provide EUR 74 million for guarantees covering losses of a portfolio of debt&#13;
      instruments and the total guarantees are estimated at EUR 370 million for SMEs under the JEREMIE&#13;
      Holding Fund.&#13;
&#13;
      The key decisions affecting the operation of the three private equity funds will be taken only after&#13;
      prior coordination with the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism. Its representatives will partici-&#13;
      pate in the Board of Directors of the JEREMIE Holding Fund.&#13;

Case-study 3: Yahoo! â&#128;&#147; what it looks for in FDI locations&#13;
&#13;
   Yahoo! is a major player in ICT and it is a highly creative and innovative company. It is a Fortune&#13;
   500 company with $600 billion in sales, has been profitable since its inception and affects 700&#13;
   million users. During the Tsunami, for example, one billion people consulted the Yahoo! website in 3&#13;
   days.&#13;
&#13;
   Innovation in the service industry is poorly understood, and as Yahoo! is a service industry player, it&#13;
   provides valuable insight into innovation in this sector. Its success is powered by technology behind&#13;
   the scenes: technology powers the development of the company, and R&amp;D is the critical input. For&#13;
   example, advertising tied to search engines depend on complex mathematical modeling; if the es-&#13;
   timation increases by a small percentage, it has a large impact on profits; also substantial economic&#13;
   research is required (experimental eco, game theory, etc.) if Yahoo! is looking to have an impact on&#13;
   the community of science as an innovative company in the services industry.&#13;

         excellent education and research systems you have, the better talent it breeds (takes a&#13;
         long time);&#13;
       - Buy â&#128;&#147; make them an offer they canâ&#128;&#153;t refuse (Texas, UAE), if enough money is available;&#13;
       - Borrow â&#128;&#147; bring the well-established diaspora or other people on temporary assign&#13;
         ments, rovide excellent working conditions, financial incentives (happens a lot in China&#13;
         and India). Bring people back through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) â&#128;&#147; can promote&#13;
         the creation of centers of excellence. It is probably the most concrete strategy for&#13;
         jump-starting the process (attractive, particularly if there is a large diaspora, good&#13;
         quality of lifeâ&#128;&#148;e.g., India, China).&#13;

   Hewlett Packardâ&#128;&#153;s Best Shore business model&#13;
  Hewlett Packard ensures that it contributes economically, intellectually, and socially to the countries&#13;
  and communities it does business in. Its policy ensures that its FDI and offshore locations benefit from&#13;
  widened access to technologies and transfer of world-leading know-how. Its model hinges upon Â´Best&#13;
  ShoreÂ´ strategy.&#13;
&#13;
  Hewlett Packard has been in Bulgaria for more than 40 years and employs 4000 people. It has been&#13;
  recognized as the number one IT company in the Bulgarian market for the last 10 years and the Hewl-&#13;
  ett Packard Bulgaria team has contributed to Hewlett Packard worldwide best practice.&#13;
&#13;
  Best Shore is a strategy for providing a homogeneous network of high quality, cost advantaged de-&#13;
  livery centers. The Best Shore Delivery Centers work closely with the regional teams and the global&#13;
  functions to deliver a comprehensive suite of ITO (Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing) services to&#13;
  Hewlett Packardâ&#128;&#153;s customers, using standard tools and processes.&#13;
&#13;
  It becomes embedded in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s processes and systems by establishing long-term relationships&#13;
  and commitment to the country, for instance, it took two years to sell Hewlett Packard within Bulgaria.&#13;
  This involves working closely with the public sector and building trust and public awareness through&#13;
  collaboration with universities, community programs and through providing consultancy services.&#13;
  These activities and close relationships with the public sector, Non Government Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
  and companies have led to Hewlett Packard achieving a strong place in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s innovation sec-&#13;
  tor, exemplified by Ms Sasha Bezuhanova, Hewlett Packard CEE Public Sector Director, being voted&#13;
  most influential woman in Bulgaria.&#13;
&#13;
  Hewlett Packard also ensures strong linkages by having an end-to-end portfolio in the country. This&#13;
  includes ITO services, data centers, workplace network, security services desk and remote manage-&#13;
  ment. R&amp;D activities in the Americas and EMEA regions are closely linked with large-scale cost advan-&#13;
  taged APJ Centers (Asia Pacific and Japan), supplementing their activities, which helps create regional&#13;
  clusters.&#13;

     Romania â&#128;&#147; Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s creation of Regional Hubs&#13;
     Renault Technologie Romanie (RTR) has positioned itself as the biggest Renault engineering center&#13;
     outside of France, and the only automotive engineering center in Eastern Europe, building a basis for&#13;
     a regional automotive engineering hub based in the country.&#13;
&#13;
     This situation, in part, grew organically out of a long-term relationship between Renault France and&#13;
     the Romanian State. The state-owned car companyâ&#128;&#153;s relationship with Renault dated back to a ten-&#13;
     year licensing agreement it signed with the firm, running from 1968-1978. When privatization of the&#13;
     company became a possibility, with a general liberalization of the Romanian economy in the 1990s,&#13;
     Renault had the competitive advantage when starting negotiations on absorbing the public company&#13;
     as it already had a proven track record, and knowledge of systems and processes in-country. In 1999&#13;
     Dacia, the Romanian state-owned car manufacturer signed a privatization contract, becoming Dacia&#13;
     Renault Group.&#13;
&#13;
     Dacia Renault Group has produced bench-mark products, the existence of which help produce a&#13;
     Â´Brand RomaniaÂ´. In 2004, it produced the Dacia Logan, a bench-mark in terms of performance and&#13;
     price and reaffirmed this bench-mark through the Dacia Duster, launched in 2010. These achieve-&#13;
     ments provide the background conditions for skills transfer in the long-term and enable the future&#13;
     growth of an automobile engineering specialty in Romania.&#13;
&#13;
     Renault Technologie Romanie has positioned Romania as a regional hub for the automotive industry.&#13;
     Its activitiesâ&#128;&#153; hub in Romania employs 2,400 people across three sites and its spoke activities employ&#13;
     a further 1,470 people across Turkey, Slovenia and Russia. It is building on this model through the Titu&#13;
     Technical Center, inaugurated in September 2010, which houses the second biggest test center for&#13;
     Renault Worldwide. Importantly, Renault is, at the same time, linking these regional activities to home&#13;
     country R&amp;D and integrating R&amp;D activities further along its value chain. The Titu Technical Center, for&#13;
     instance, complements technical centers in Aubevoye and Lardy (France).&#13;

            Innovating through the crisis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            On June 9-11, 2011, the Ruder Boskovic
            Institute of Croatia, the Korea Development Institute and
            the World Bank organized a high-level policy workshop in
            Dubrovnik, Croatia, which was the culminating event of a
            joint capacity development initiative 'Innovating
            through the crisis how to do it?' conducted between
            February and May 2011, covering Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland
            and Romania. The initiative comprised a series of activities
            (position papers, country case studies and a policy
            workshop) targeting key actors in resource allocation for
            innovation policy within broader development agendas. The
            workshop's objective was to help the group of four
            economies mainstream innovation and Research and Development
            (R and D) policies into their development agendas including
            in the context of aligning with the requirements of the
            Europe 2020 strategy. Advanced economies, however, have
            adopted counter-cyclical innovation policies to create a
            basis for new growth. Innovation activities defined broadly
            as conceiving, designing and implementing changes in the
            available set of products, services and processes, (i.e.
            production, organizational and marketing processes) may have
            a positive contribution to export, competitiveness and
            economic growth. In the context of fiscal constraints,
            governments face key common challenges in adjusting the
            innovation policy agenda namely competing development
            priorities, drops in private financing of R and D and
            innovation and declining foreign investments, among others.
