by the government and the civil society were centred around them. The government developed&#13;
guidelines, legislation, systems and procedures for engaging citizens. Similarly civil society&#13;
initiatives focused on awareness creation and mobilization of citizens to participate in the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the funds.&#13;

The LATF was introduced in 1998 with aims to improve and extend service delivery to&#13;
communities, improve financial management and resolve Local Authority (LA) debts. The&#13;
LATF was structured in block transfers of 5 percent of the national income tax revenue to LAs.&#13;
The goal of the LATF was enable Local Authorities to improve and extend service delivery to&#13;
citizens, improve financial management and resolve Local Authority debts. To qualify for LATF&#13;

1.3 Constituency Development Fund&#13;
The Constituency Development Fund (CDF) was established in 2003, amended in 2007 and renewed&#13;
in 2013. This paper mainly focuses on the CDF framework as established in 2003 and amended in 2007&#13;
to capture the historical experiences. Of all local development funding instruments, the CDF has been&#13;
Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s most popular, both with the public and government.1 Much like the LATF, the primary objective&#13;
of the CDF is to implement development projects that address poverty at the constituency level. The&#13;
fund receives an annual allocation of 2.5 percent of government revenues. The amounts received at the&#13;
constituency levels are distributed by a formula guided by national and constituency poverty levels. The&#13;
formula prioritizes infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
CDF projects are administered through a hierarchy of committees comprising members of the public at&#13;
the local level and political and executive officials at the central administrative level. The Constituency&#13;
Development Fund Committee (CDFC) and the Project Management Committee (PMC) are the structures&#13;
operating at the constituency level. Appendix 1 shows the composition of the entire CDF structure, under&#13;
the 2007 framework and Figure 2 details the CDF process.&#13;

2.1 Strengths&#13;
CSO reports and the case studies provide examples where citizen participation has contributed to&#13;
local service delivery. They illustrate that collaborative initiatives between the government and CSO's&#13;
contributed to greater success of participatory initiatives. For instance joint mobilization efforts between&#13;
government and civil society can bring higher levels of citizen engagement and improve development&#13;
results. They also highlight how CSOs play a key role to facilitate citizen participation, through initiatives&#13;
such as designing training handbooks to assist communities in understanding how CDF works, how to&#13;
participate in various stages of the CDF project cycle and how to effectively monitor expenditure through&#13;
social audits. Also, CSO monitoring initiatives like the Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s CDF Report Card had considerable positive&#13;
improvement on the management of the CDF. Where citizen participation has functioned well, CSOs and&#13;
others identify several factors that contribute to success:&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strong emphasis on mobilization. Enlisting local leaders and government together with extensive&#13;
   outreach to citizens on what they should expect a project to accomplish and how they can participate is&#13;
   important. Some local CDF and LATF projects successfully enlisted local leaders such as chiefs and village&#13;
   elders to mobilize citizens, used multiple channels to alert citizens in advance about opportunities to&#13;
   participate in project identification, used accessible venues at convenient times of the day, and made&#13;
   special efforts to reach out to the poor and vulnerable groups. Setting and publicizing clear processes&#13;
   and guidelines for participation is also important.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Providing up-front training on how participatory processes will work, involving both local government&#13;
   and civil society representatives. Clearly explaining what citizens are asked to participate in, why, and&#13;
   how it relates to bigger development programs is crucial. But a review of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s experience highlights&#13;
   that these participatory processes often work better when local government has been enlisted in the&#13;
   process, and civil servants trained on how to set up effective participatory processes. Case studies also&#13;
   provide examples of how CSOs working with local government and local communities to organize effective&#13;
   outreach and use of social accountability tools, yielded better results and opportunities for sustainability.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Communicating critical information in formats and using channels that are accessible and user&#13;
   friendly. Depending on the topic of citizen participationâ&#128;&#148;e.g. plans, budgets, implementation, new&#13;
   draft policies, laws, regulations, etc.â&#128;&#148;providing carefully tailored information on the content (what&#13;
   citizens are asked to participate in) and process (how they can participate) in formats and through&#13;
   channels that are accessible to citizens is crucial for effective participation.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Building incentives for officials to conduct effective public participation. LATF required local&#13;
   authorities to submit reports on public participation as part of overall reporting required before another&#13;
   fund transfer could be authorized.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Linking citizen oversight with technical expertise. A key feature of the more successful projects was the&#13;
   technical training and advice received primarily from government engineers. Involvement of the technical&#13;
   experts in preparing bills of quantity, and inspection of projects, proved helpful for citizens in project&#13;
   management committees (PMCs) of the CDF. For instance PMCs that paid contractors in installments after&#13;
   inspection by the experts had more completed projects than those who paid contractors up front, as once&#13;
   full payment was received, contractors had little incentive to complete projects.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Establishing independent oversight bodies and other checks and balances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2007, the Ministry of Local Government commissioned a study to assess the impact of the LASDAP.&#13;
The study established that though there were significant challenges with the implementation of LASDAP,&#13;
it played a key role towards institutionalizing participation in the local government decision making&#13;
process. While the government was concerned about the quality of participation, it acknowledged that&#13;
the introduction of LASDAP, not only enhanced citizen participation, but provided the tools for more&#13;
equitable and participatory allocation of resources from LATF and enabled councils to provide marginally&#13;
better services. The study established that legal and institutional frameworks are extremely important in&#13;
ensuring the success of LASDAP processes as well as integrating local development processes. It further&#13;
recommended that the LASDAP needed to be fully institutionalized so that participation in the process&#13;
would move beyond mere consultation.&#13;

CDF legislation, the decisions regarding which projects to finance were often made in a non-transparent&#13;
manner, with few criteria. By contrast, the LATF/LASDAP process, which included procedures for open&#13;
decision meetings combined with a consensus meeting, helped ensure that citizens would be involved in&#13;
the prioritization of projects and funding decisions. However, aside from the budget allocated to LASDAP,&#13;
the overall Local Authority budget formulation processes were typically not inclusive of citizen input.&#13;
&#13;
The lack of public, comparative data on the performance of local funds also limits the ability of&#13;
citizens to assess performance and hold service deliverers to account. Although LATF collected data&#13;
comparing performance of different local authorities, this was not shared with the public, which meant&#13;
that citizens had little basis for assessing how their local authority was performing. Without public systems&#13;
to distinguish better versus poorly performing service delivery units, there are limited incentives to reward&#13;
good performers and sanction poor ones.&#13;
&#13;
Where it did occur, citizen involvement was concentrated in the planning, and identification stages&#13;
but was limited in project implementation, procurement and monitoring stages. The LASDAP&#13;
system required local authorities to submit evidence of participation in project identification, linked&#13;
to performance reports and future funding tranches, and this contributed to local authorities more&#13;
regularly involving citizens in project decision meetings. Although decentralized funds legislation and&#13;
guidelines also provided for participatory monitoring and reporting systems, these provisions were rarely&#13;
implemented or enforced. A key reason is that fund transfers from LATF to each local authority were tied&#13;
only to participation in the decision-making phase of the project and not to the monitoring phase. Under&#13;
LASDAP, the reports of the citizen monitoring committees were submitted to the local council, but not&#13;
to the Ministry of Local Government, with the result that Local Authority performance on participatory&#13;
monitoring and complaint redressal were not systematically tracked or linked to future LATF fund transfers.&#13;
Without such an incentive, most local authorities simply ignored these requirements, and citizens and&#13;
CSOs were not well equipped to demand LA compliance with these guidelines. Further, project oversight&#13;
in the LASDAP implementation was hampered by lack of training of project committees by council&#13;
technical teams making it difficult for these teams to provide feedback on project implementation even&#13;
if they would have liked to.&#13;
&#13;
The structure, composition and governance of local fund committees also hindered independent&#13;
oversight. CDF and LATF were both criticized as being used to further political or patronage agendas&#13;
with politicians and officials manipulating committee membership, controlling decisions and priority&#13;
setting and mobilizing their own supporters rather than all citizens. CSOs widely report challenges with&#13;
CDF. They note that CDF procedures, with MPs and their appointees serving simultaneously as decision&#13;
makers, implementers and watchdogs of the CDF activities impose a major constraint on effectiveness&#13;
and transparency of the fund (Romero, 2009). CDFs do not require consensus meetings with citizen&#13;
representatives for project selection; as a result, it was unclear how well CDF projects represented&#13;
community interests. Project oversight in the LASDAP was hampered by lack of training of project&#13;
committees by council technical teams making it difficult for these teams to provide feedback on project&#13;
implementation even if they would have liked to (World Bank 2013). Social audit groups were also found&#13;
to be susceptible to elite capture with certain groups being captured by community elites, some of&#13;
whom were decentralized fund managers. Citizens and CSO representatives report that they have faced&#13;
intimidation, threats and hostility when attempting to hold decentralized fund management to account.&#13;
Gender, ethnicity, disability, education and poverty levels affect citizensâ&#128;&#153; awareness and ability to&#13;
participate in how decentralized funds are used. Multiple CSO reports suggest a gender gap between men&#13;
and womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation and that high levels of illiteracy hinder awareness and capacity to participate.&#13;
Government reports provide evidence of ethnicity affecting citizensâ&#128;&#153; ability to participate.&#13;
&#13;
CSO reports consistently suggest that most recourse and complaint mechanisms are ineffective,&#13;
that citizens are not aware of these mechanisms, and do not feel their grievances are resolved. Such&#13;
mechanisms are critical for involving citizens in project oversight especially in the activities of project&#13;
contractors at the local level.&#13;

challenges of sustainability and scale that afflict many CSO initiatives, which tend to be small and external&#13;
to government. County governments have strong incentives to improve service delivery and engage&#13;
their citizens, they manage larger resources than past decentralized funds, and they oversee integrated&#13;
development planning and monitoring processes that provide an opportunity to scale up lessons from&#13;
past citizen engagement efforts.&#13;
&#13;
But enhancing participation will require sustained efforts by government and civil society to establish&#13;
structured processes that are efficient and inclusive. On the government side, this will include setting&#13;
guidelines and mechanisms for sharing information and soliciting feedback around county government&#13;
processes like planning, budgeting, and monitoring. It will also depend on government providing&#13;
guidelines and training of civil servants so that they are able to effectively facilitate participation and&#13;
transparency in these processes. Civil society actors can help to define priorities of what they would like&#13;
county governments to operationalize first, and they can also help government put in place and initially&#13;
roll out such systems (as is happening in a number of counties).&#13;
&#13;
It will also require government to designate and train responsible staff, and allocate adequate&#13;
budget for building and rolling out new mechanisms. There are necessary costs associated with&#13;
mobilization, sharing information, and obtaining ongoing feedback. Other costs include those of CSOs&#13;
providing support to citizens and the time spent by public officials in organizing and participating in civic&#13;
engagement. Provisioning appropriate amounts of funds for participation is therefore necessary. In some&#13;
LASDAP projects, a small fee of Ksh 1,000 was paid to the monitoring and evaluation committee members&#13;
for transport, allowing them to carry on their duty without incurring personal expense. Other costs that&#13;
should be taken into account include time spent by public officials in organizing and participating in civic&#13;
engagement and costs involved for CSOs to provide support to citizens.&#13;
&#13;
Research suggests that incentives already exist for politicians to improve local service delivery and&#13;
related participatory processes. A review of local CDF performance versus re-election chances of MPs&#13;
in 2007 found that Kenyans based their decision on whether to re-elect their MP on a number of factors,&#13;
including how the contending MPs managed the CDF. The review found that in order for decentralized&#13;
efforts to have a positive impact on poverty and to be accountable, voters needed information about the&#13;
quality of locally provided public goods.&#13;
&#13;
Timely communication of critical information is a pre-requisite for effective participation. Local&#13;
governments had to communicate information necessary for participation, such as meeting times, venue,&#13;
agenda, but also information on ongoing projects and service delivery such as project budgets, contractor&#13;
procurement, and availability of public services. Providing forums where all this information was discussed&#13;
offered opportunities for communication between citizens and local government and reinforced social-&#13;
auditing mechanisms while rebuilding trust between both parties.&#13;
&#13;
Citizen participation works better when local government participatory mechanisms are monitored&#13;
and tied to funding and other incentives. Reviews of LASDAP and LATF illustrate how requirements&#13;
for local authorities to submit evidence of citizen participation in project identification can enhance&#13;
participatory planning. Such incentives can be extended to other aspects of citizen participation, including&#13;
transparency of planning and finances, and involving citizens in monitoring. Citizen engagement in local&#13;
fund project implementation and monitoring phases was hampered because (i) citizens lacked general&#13;
skills to monitor construction work, (ii) officials who were supposed to provide assistance were not&#13;
available and, (iii) few sanctions were available to citizens if any irregularities were found. Addressing these&#13;
limitations through clear guidelines, training or hiring technical experts and monitoring and ensuring&#13;
government responses to citizen grievances would improve citizen participation in local government.&#13;

Conduct civic education so that citizens&#13;
understand the basic roles, functions,&#13;
responsibilities of county assemblies and&#13;
executives. A citizen handbook on participation&#13;
at the county level that explains entry points&#13;
for citizens in county budget making, planning,&#13;
budgeting, performance monitoring in simple,&#13;
user-friendly formats would greatly help. This&#13;
handbook can pull together information on key&#13;
legal requirements and build on and scale up the&#13;
material from multiple citizen guides developed        Work site of new administration police post funded by CDF&#13;
&#13;
by CSOs to help citizens participate in devolved&#13;
government processes. A list of some of the materials is annexed at the end the brief. Building media&#13;
capacity on devolution, and recognizing good journalism on devolution, can also help.&#13;
&#13;
Develop government systems to facilitate participatory processes drawing on experience from Kenya&#13;
and globally. Facilitating public participation will depend partly on counties building internal government&#13;
capacity and systems for planning and monitoring key development results and targets, managing public&#13;
finances and procurement, aligning civil servant roles, qualifications, and performance to larger county&#13;
and national development goals. It will also require focused efforts to integrate participatory processes&#13;
into these systems, such as to: (i) create and disseminate user-friendly information (e.g., on budgets, plans,&#13;
legislation) and link with communications, (ii) mobilize citizens and conduct participatory planning and&#13;
budgeting processes (e.g. to design and rollout participatory and inclusive County Budget and Economic&#13;
Forums), (iii) put in place effective recourse mechanisms.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Ensure that county planning and budgeting processes integrate other funding sources, so as not to&#13;
   overwhelm citizens with too many requests for feedback. For example, integrating CDF and donor-funded&#13;
   program investments with the County Integrated Development Planning process can help to reduce&#13;
   fragmentation. County Budget and Economic Forums can be a key locus of such citizen engagement,&#13;
   and counties and other stakeholders are requesting further elaboration on how to operationalize&#13;
   these forums. Experience suggests that citizens tend to engage most actively around local investment&#13;
   and service delivery decisions that directly affect their livelihoods and opportunities, so it will be&#13;
   important to figure out how CIDP and County Budget and Economic Forum processes can reach down&#13;
   to understand and aggregate citizen priorities at the local ward level and upwards.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Structure county planning and budgeting processes so that there is a clear calendar of opportunities for&#13;
   citizens to engage, and clarity on objectives and how citizen feedback will be used. County Budget and&#13;
   Economic Forums provide a legally mandated structure to involve citizens in the budget and public&#13;
   expenditure management process. However these forums require careful planning and organization&#13;
   in order to be effective: (i) citizens need to clearly understand the objectives of their participation; (ii)&#13;
   citizens need to have adequate and user-friendly information on county budgets (basic information),&#13;
   how their county is performing relative to others in the area of the budget that they are being asked to&#13;
   comment on; (iii) citizens need to be informed about budget ceilings, and asked to prioritize within the&#13;
   ceiling; (iv) citizens need to be informed about how their views were considered in finalizing the budget.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Develop systems and incentives for counties to disclose financial and performance information on local&#13;
   service delivery. Simplified reports are needed for effective citizen involvement in setting planning&#13;
   and budget priorities. National and county government can regularly update and disseminate lists&#13;
   of projects, budgets, names of responsible managers under county jurisdictions. These lists can be&#13;
   maintained using web-based technologies and portals, ideally linked to systems like the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   eProMIS and IFMIS, but dissemination will be more effective if it utilizes traditional means such as&#13;
   bulletin boards, community radio, reviewing project status and spending in public baraza.&#13;

Expand civil society partnerships to help counties build effective systems and processes for&#13;
participation, transparency, and mobilization, in addition to carrying out their own participation&#13;
and monitoring activities. Civil society organizations bring rich experience on how counties can&#13;
operationalize transparency, participation, and recourse mechanisms that are useful for citizens and that&#13;
improve service delivery. Individual counties are enlisting civil society organizations to help them structure&#13;
and carry out effective participation processes. This collaboration can be reinforced and expanded by&#13;
government and civil society organizations. In addition, CSOs can strengthen coalitions and partnerships&#13;
to define common priorities for county participation, support county system building, and monitor&#13;
implementation. However, CSOs report that there are limited incentives for collaboration and system&#13;
building work, versus strong incentives to conduct discrete projects and monitoring tasks. There is a need&#13;
to strengthen and incentivize emerging and existing partnershipsâ&#128;&#148;such as the Devolution Forum, the&#13;
Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA), the Decentralization and Governance Non State Actors&#13;
Network (DEGONSA), the Parliamentary Working Group and Parliamentary Initiative Network (PIN), as well&#13;
as county level CSO networks such as the Homa Bay Civil Society Networkâ&#128;&#148;and to link interested counties&#13;
with capable CSOs, as well as to create clearinghouses and forums where county participation initiatives&#13;
are shared, good practices identified and highlighted.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Expand partnerships between experienced civil society actors and county governments to design, test, and&#13;
   roll out participatory planning, budgeting and monitoring systems. There are already initiatives in Taita&#13;
   Taveta County led by the International Budget Partnership and Busia County with National Tax Payers&#13;
   Association (NTA).&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Build capacity of CSOs working at county level to deepen their focus on citizen engagement in county&#13;
   processes and service delivery, and to help citizens make use of new opportunities provided by&#13;
   counties.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Develop CSO coalitions to define common priorities for county participation, exchange experiences on&#13;
   participation in devolved systems, as well as to track county progress.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Create clearing houses and forums to share participation experiences across counties, identify and share&#13;
   good practices. The Devolution Forum and the DEGONSA are examples of such efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Donors can support Kenyan civil society organizations to help build responsive and accountable county&#13;
institutions, in addition to traditional monitoring activities. Key opportunities for donors include:&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Support partnerships between experienced civil society actors and county governments to design, test, and&#13;
   roll out participatory planning, budgeting and monitoring systems, and participatory approaches to&#13;
   enhance county service delivery.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Increase longer-term support for coalitions and networks that bring together CSOs working on devolution&#13;
   to exchange knowledge on their interventions on core county systems and service delivery. This can build&#13;
   on the comparative strengths of different CSOsâ&#128;&#148;on budget transparency, civic education, service&#13;
   delivery monitoringâ&#128;&#148;and can also be a locus for exchange with other countries that have focused on&#13;
   participation in devolution.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Encourage/require grantees to use some common criteria for monitoring counties, put devolution civic&#13;
   education materials and data on shared platforms, build shared clearing houses.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Place greater emphasis in grant-making on longer term grants including criteria to measure how well a CSO&#13;
   is linked with, represents, and is accountable to its stakeholders, and that encourages CSOs to raise some&#13;
   funds locally by ensuring that citizens interests are well represented.&#13;

            Participation in Kenya's local
            development funds : reviewing the past to inform the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kenya's new Constitution mandates a
            new era of public participation in government, particularly
            within the devolved government structure. The new devolved
            structures can benefit from reviewing the country's
            prior experience with participation in decentralized funds.
            The Kenyan government and citizens gained extensive
            experience in local participatory development through
            decentralized programs and funds, in particular the local
            authority transfer fund (LATF) and the constituency
            development fund (CDF). This paper focuses on the two
            development funds because participatory initiatives both by
            the government and the civil society were centered on them.
            This paper reviews Kenya's past experiences on public
            participation in local service delivery to highlight
            practical lessons that county governments can draw from as
            they design participation mechanisms.
