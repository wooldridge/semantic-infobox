ABSTRACT&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to take a close look at the&#13;
socio-economic rationale of higher education provision in develop-&#13;
ing countries. This is done by reviewing the costs and benefits&#13;
associated with investment in higher education as a whole and&#13;
especially in different post-secondary subjects. University costs,&#13;
and in particular benefits, are treated here in their broadest&#13;
sense to arrive at the true contribution of higher education to the&#13;
standard of living of the present and future generations. This&#13;
socio-economic evaluation of the higher education subsector is&#13;
performed by reference to a multi-country, multi-period data set,&#13;
which has been augmented by nonquantitative considerations.&#13;

SECTION I&#13;
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY&#13;
1.1       Higher education, the very top step of the learning ladder,&#13;
sometimes finds itself at the bottom of the hierarchy when considering&#13;
priorities in educational spending. The recent common prescription for&#13;
economic development is injections of basic and especially vocational&#13;
education. After all, it is extremely difficult to rationalize expend-&#13;
iture on another university when a high proportion of the country's&#13;
population is illiterate.&#13;
1.2       Given this setting, the purpose of this paper is to take a close&#13;
look at the socioeconomic rationale of higher education provision in&#13;
developing countries. This is done by reviewing the costs and benefits&#13;
associated with investment in higher education as a whole and especially&#13;
in different post-secondary subjects. University costs, and in particu-&#13;
lar benefits, are treated here in their broadest sense to arrive at the&#13;
true contribution of higher education to the standard of living of the&#13;
present and future generations. This socioeconomic evaluation of the&#13;
higher education subsector is performed by reference to a multi-country,&#13;
multi-period data set, which has been augmented by nonquantitative&#13;
considerations.&#13;
Paper Outline&#13;
1.3       Beyond this introduction, the paper contains eight additional&#13;
sections and an Appendix. Section II documents some recent trends in&#13;
the allocation of education budgets around the world that are of interest&#13;
to the subject matter of this study and serves as the starting point of&#13;
the remaining argument. Section III is normative, in the sense of spell-&#13;
ing out the criteria of social choice in education. The set of usual&#13;
criteria is expanded to include the satisfaction of social demand for&#13;
education and career flexibility because of rapid technological change.&#13;
1.4       Higher education costs are tackled at two levels.  First, at&#13;
the aggregate university level (Section IV) and disaggregated by field of&#13;
study (Section V). These two sections permit an analysis of the behavior&#13;
of unit costs as enrollment rises and also document cost differences&#13;
between various university faculties.&#13;
1.5       Section VI deals with the quantitative side of higher education&#13;
benefits, such as the earning advantage of the graduates of different&#13;
subjects, social demand satisfaction, income distribution and employment&#13;
prospects. The purpose of Section VII is to bring together the costs and&#13;
benefits documented above in order to answer the question: how does the&#13;
economic payoff of expenditure on university education compare with that&#13;
of other sectors in a variety of country settings? Also, how do the&#13;
different fields of university specialization compare in terms of net&#13;
economic rewards?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.6       Section VIII expands the line of argument to include non-&#13;
quantitative aspects of the choice between liberal and vocational&#13;
education by reference to curriculum theory and the sociology of know-&#13;
ledge and change. The final section (Section IX) makes some concluding&#13;
remarks regarding the applicability of a "vocational school fallacy" in&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
1.7       The Appendix contains a long list of digested raw material that&#13;
served as the basis of this study.&#13;
Synopsis of the Major Points&#13;
1.8       University expenditures in developing countries typically&#13;
account for less than 20% of the state budget for education. An increas-&#13;
ing part of this expenditure is devoted to technical and vocational&#13;
subjects. This is evidenced by the rising relative share of university&#13;
enrollments in engineering, agriculture and related fields of&#13;
specialization. The trend towards technical and vocational subjects is&#13;
also reflected in the educational lending priorities of the World Bank.&#13;
Consider, for example, the switch in the percentage distribution of&#13;
loans by curriculum type between the 1960s and the late 1970s:&#13;
1963-69   1970-74   1976   1979&#13;
General Subjects  1/          44         42      40      24&#13;
Technical and                 44         45      47      58&#13;
Agricultural Subjects&#13;
The main reason advanced to explain the world wide trend towards technical&#13;
subjects is the intuitive notion that it is technical education that&#13;
contributes to economic development.&#13;
1.9       We start examining the scientific basis of this notion by laying&#13;
down criteria for social choice in education. The usual social efficiency&#13;
(i.e. economic growth) and income distribution criteria are augmented by&#13;
equity considerations such as the satisfaction of social demand for&#13;
education, the employability of graduates and, more importantly, their&#13;
adaptability to a continuously changing economic and social environment&#13;
and their potential of learning on the job. Part of these evaluation&#13;
criteria could be given a quantitative content, e.g., one can assess the&#13;
extent to which the provision of a particular kind of education affects&#13;
social efficiency.&#13;
1.10      An anatomy of university costs at the aggregate level reveals the&#13;
existence of considerable returns to scale. Namely, the per student unit&#13;
cost decreases as university enrollment rises, especially up to the point&#13;
corresponding to a 3% enrollment ratio.&#13;
Average cost&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
1.11      The implication of this finding for countries with a low level&#13;
of university enrollment is that tertiary education expansion could be&#13;
achieved by a lower level of expenditure relative to the one anticipated&#13;
on the basis of the current nominal average cost per student.&#13;
1.12      But there exist wide differences in educational costs depending&#13;
on the curriculum type: university subjects such as agriculture,&#13;
sciences and engineering are on the average more than twice as expensive&#13;
relative to general subjects. As shown below, agricultural subjects are&#13;
on top of the relative expensiveness index:&#13;
(Cost of all higher education subjects = 100)&#13;
Agriculture          191&#13;
Sciences             125&#13;
Engineering          111&#13;
Arts                  73&#13;
Humanities            67&#13;
Social Sciences       50&#13;
1.13      Turning to university benefits we first approximate them by the&#13;
relative earnings advantage of graduates of various disciplines. The&#13;
earnings discrepancies shown below are not as wide as the cost discrepancies&#13;
between subjects. But agriculture is now in the bottom of the earnings&#13;
league:&#13;
(Earnings of all higher education graduates = 100)&#13;
Engineering          106&#13;
Social Sciences      104&#13;
Arts                  94&#13;
Sciences              88&#13;
Agriculture           87&#13;
This earnings structure is not fully attributable to public sector salary&#13;
scales.&#13;
1.14      Comparison of the costs and benefits yields an economic return&#13;
of about 15% for higher education as a whole (developing countries' average).&#13;
This compares favorably to the economic returns in a selection of physical&#13;
capital projects. The economic return on higher education expenditure is&#13;
at least as competitive as that of other sectors in most country settings.&#13;
1.15      Disaggregation of the economic returns by field of specialization&#13;
(as shown below) reveals the low position of agriculture relative to some&#13;
other fields:&#13;
Economics             15.0%&#13;
Sciences              14.2%&#13;
Humanities            14.0%&#13;
Agriculture            8.0%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.16      Turning to the job prospects of higher education graduates,&#13;
a distinction is made between the incidence and the duration of&#13;
unemployment. On the incidence issue, it is secondary school graduates&#13;
who exhibit the highest unemployment rate. Contrary to the popular&#13;
belief, the statistics demonstrate that the incidence of unemployment&#13;
among university graduates is more or less equal to the average unemploy-&#13;
ment rate for the working population as a whole. On the duration issue,&#13;
the evidence points to the fact that -nemployment is a sharply declining&#13;
function of age or time since gradvt!: ..L:&#13;
Unemployment&#13;
Time since graduation&#13;
What this means is that a great part of what appears to be unemployment&#13;
might in fact be a voluntary search process.&#13;
Qualifications&#13;
1.17      In interpreting the conclusions of this study, one should bear&#13;
in mind the following qualifications: first, the sample of countries&#13;
is extremely small, although these are the very countries for which at&#13;
least some evidence exists on this research front. Second, most case&#13;
studies refer to urban populations and there must exist considerable&#13;
within-country regional differences in the variables examined. Third,&#13;
one must place greater confidence on the cost relative to the benefits&#13;
evidence, since a great part of the latter is based on public sector&#13;
employment. It is hoped that future tracer studies and within-country&#13;
cost analyses will throw additional light on some of the hypotheses&#13;
put forward in this paper. Fourth, the documented low position of&#13;
agriculture in the subject benefit-cost league might be downward biased,&#13;
because of the difficulty in quantifying the research output of agricul-&#13;
tural faculties.&#13;
1.18      The fact that the available evidence points to the existence&#13;
of returns to scale from university expansion and high benefit-cost ratios&#13;
of non-vocational subjects should not be interpreted as an advocated policy&#13;
switch from basic to higher education, or from engineering and agronomy to&#13;
liberal arts. Rather the results contained in this paper should, at the&#13;
very least, serve as a reminder that technical and general curricula&#13;
have their place in the development of a balanced educational system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SECTION II&#13;
CURRENT BUDGETARY ALLOCATION TRENDS&#13;
2.1       Education is a major resource user.  According to Unesco&#13;
estimates, the total public world expenditure on education in the mid-&#13;
1970s was of the order of 300 billion US dollars (Unesco, 1977, Table 17).&#13;
Taking into account private expenditure and the foregone earnings of those&#13;
in school, the true resource cost of education should be well above double&#13;
this figure. It is the sheer absolute size of the education expenditure&#13;
that compels an "economic" look at the way this money is spent.  Of course&#13;
the economic look does not deny a more academic, cultural or other approach&#13;
to education. It simply complements it.&#13;
2.2       In this section we present some facts on current trends in the&#13;
allocation of education budgets around the world. This first section is&#13;
"positive" in the sense of not asking the question of how good or bad the&#13;
trends are. The "normative" check is relegated to a later part of this&#13;
paper, after some evaluation criteria have been spelled out in Section III.&#13;
2.3       Although impressive, the absolute figure mentioned above is meaning-&#13;
less unless related to a common benchmark or disaggregated by education or&#13;
country type. The common benchmarks are the country's per capita income,&#13;
gross domestic product or total state budget. The disaggregation usually&#13;
refers to a country's level of economic development, the level of education&#13;
the expenditure refers to, or the between-subject division of, say, higher&#13;
education. Although the focus of the paper is this last division, we&#13;
present other figures as well by way of introduction.&#13;
The Between Country Type Distinction&#13;
2.4       Table 2.1 shows two dramatic differences between more and less&#13;
developed regions in the distribution of public educational expenditure. The&#13;
first difference refers to the fact that 90% of the world expenditure in&#13;
education takes place in advanced countries. The true resource share of&#13;
edlucation in advanced countries must be even higher, when the differential&#13;
opportunity cost of schooling is taken into account. The second point to note&#13;
is; the similarity in the percentage of GNP spent on education between country&#13;
groups (see last column of Table 2.1).  When expressed in relative terms,&#13;
the 10% expenditure share of developing countries amounts to 3.9% of their&#13;
GNP, whereas the corresponding figure in advanced countries is 5.7%. Clearly,&#13;
developing countries put nearly as much effort as advanced countries into&#13;
financing their educational systems.&#13;

The Between Educational Level Distinction&#13;
2.5       Table 2.2 presents the typical education budget allocation in a&#13;
few developing countries. Although there exists wide variation between&#13;
individual countries, primary education in developing countries typically&#13;
absorbs about 40% to 50% of the education budget, whereas the shares of&#13;
secondary and higher education are about one-quarter and one-fifth,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
2.6       This allocation pattern is the end result of the interplay between&#13;
high enrollments and low unit cost of the primary level on the one hand, and&#13;
low enrollments and high unit cost at the university level on the other&#13;
hand.&#13;

The Field of Study Distinction&#13;
2.7       Published statistics on expenditure by field of study are&#13;
extremely scarce because the accounting of the spending unit (say, the&#13;
university) is performed at the global level, many departments sharing&#13;
overhead costs (such as administration and libraries). In a later section&#13;
of this paper we will present a compilation of micro cost statistics at&#13;
the individual department or school level.&#13;
2.8       It is sufficient to present here some indirect evidence on the&#13;
allocation of funds by field of study, simply by looking at enrollment&#13;
data in these fields. Table 2.3 shows the percentage of university enroll-&#13;
ments by field of study in an international cross-section. This table&#13;
reveals a striking similarity in the share of enrollments in different&#13;
fields of study around the world.&#13;
2.9       This might be the result of a deliberate developing countries'&#13;
policy of a 6-to-4 bias in favor of scientific and technical subjects,&#13;
implemented by a series of incentives (such as grants and bursaries) to&#13;
attract students in such faculties.  This policy was first officially&#13;
proposed and accepted by African governments at the first ministerial&#13;
level meeting held in Tananarive in 1962 (see the resulting Conference&#13;
Report, Unesco, 1963).&#13;

Over Time Allocation Trends&#13;
2.10      Table 2.4 shows time trends in the allocation of educational&#13;
budgets by country type at five-year intervals. The percentage of GNP&#13;
spent on education has increased steadily, although developing countries&#13;
are lagging behind the world average both in terms of level and growth&#13;
of expenditure. The fact that educational expenditure in developing&#13;
countries is not growing as fast as in advanced countries is more clearly&#13;
shown in the second panel of Table 2.4.&#13;
2.11      The third panel of the same table shows the share of the&#13;
educational budget spent on university education. Although this share&#13;
has slightly increased between 1970 and 1975, it still remains below&#13;
one-fifth of the public recurrent budget. Paradoxically, there are no&#13;
differences in this statistic between developed and developing country&#13;
groups. 1/&#13;

2.12      These world averages might in fact conceal the actual trend&#13;
within individual countries.  As an example, Figure 2.1 shows the evolution&#13;
of composition of enrollments in one African country (Sudan). The clear&#13;
trend shown is that of an over time squeeze of arts-based general faculties&#13;
in favor of a simultaneous expansion of technically oriented sciences.&#13;
(see Appendix Table F.8). The Sudan is not a unique case in this respect.&#13;
As shown in Table 2.5 enrollments in vocational university faculties in&#13;
East Africa, such as agriculture and engineering, have grown much faster&#13;
than in general faculties.&#13;

2.13      And it is not only at the tertiary level that the vocational-&#13;
technical bias has been at its forte. The "sixth-form," i.e. the last&#13;
year of secondary schools feeding the universities in the British-based&#13;
educational systems, has been science-biased as well. As an example,&#13;
consider the case of Tanzania (Table 2.6) where the share of enrollment&#13;
in arts subjects in the sixth-form has gradually trickled down from about&#13;
50 per cent in 1961 to nearly one-quarter in 1975.&#13;

2.14      Cases such as the ones documented above are typical of what&#13;
has been happening around the developing world since the early 19.60,&#13;
based on an intuitive imitation of the Western "techno-structure" for&#13;
accelerated economic growth.&#13;
The World Bank Lever&#13;
2.15      Although the allocation of the education budget is a given&#13;
country's decision, the World Bank lending policy might have an indirect&#13;
effect on the way educational funds are spent in some developing countries.&#13;
The reason is that a Bank decision to, say, provide a loan for the construc-&#13;
tion of a technical rather than a general secondary school in country X,&#13;
later entails a higher budgetary recurrent expenditure for technical&#13;
education.&#13;
2.16      Table 2.7 presents the distribution of World Bank education&#13;
lending by level and curriculum type. Although the numbers fluctuate a&#13;
lot because of particular loans in particular years (right four columns),&#13;
one general trend is an increase in the share of loans towards technical&#13;
and agricultural curricula. Whereas in the mid-1960s general and&#13;
vocational curricula had an equal share in the composition of educational&#13;
loans, the balance had been heavily tipped to the technical side'by the&#13;
late 1970s.&#13;

2.17      Could it be that the World Bank's education lending policy&#13;
tacitly supports the view that it is engineering and technical education&#13;
that contribute to economic development? 1/ In the affirmative case&#13;
one has to question the scientific base of this common view, a subject&#13;
to be discussed later in this paper.&#13;
1/ At least this has been the stated objective of the 1974 Education&#13;
Sector Paper: "In the future ... a decrease for ... higher education&#13;
is projected. Lending for general education ... will decline and&#13;
support for technical education ... will remain ..." See World Bank&#13;

SECTION III&#13;
THE CRITERIA OF SOCIAL CHOICE IN EDUCATION&#13;
3.1       In the previous section we documented a more or less clear&#13;
trend away from general and towards technical-vocational subjects at the&#13;
university and pre-university levels. In order to judge whether this&#13;
trend is in the desired direction one must spell out normative criteria&#13;
of choice.&#13;
3.2       The traditional economic criteria for evaluating any project&#13;
that affects the community, are its efficiency, equity and employment&#13;
effects. However, in the case of university education we must expand&#13;
this list to include the so-called social demand satisfaction and&#13;
flexibility benefits. These terms are explained below.&#13;
The Social Well-being Function&#13;
3.3       To formalize the treatment it is assumed that social well-&#13;
being (or the prosperity of the nation) is a function of a series of&#13;
arguments, 1/ i.e.&#13;
Social well-being = f(X , X2, X3, X4, X5, g )&#13;
where X  is efficiency&#13;
1&#13;
X2 is equity&#13;
3 is employment&#13;
X4 is social demand satisfaction&#13;
5 is flexibility benefits&#13;
9  is a set of other unmeasurable arguments.&#13;
Any project, educational or other, is bound to affect specific arguments&#13;
in the right hand side of this function. The questions that arise are:&#13;
(a) In what direction is a given effect? (e.g. does it&#13;
increase or decrease efficiency?). This is a sign problem.&#13;
(b) What is the quantitative dimension of the effect? (e.g.&#13;
does it increase efficiency by a large or by a small&#13;
amount?). This is a size problem.&#13;
(c)  How does one treat trade-offs between arguments in the above&#13;
function? (e.g. when efficiency increases by a large amount&#13;
but equity diminishes). This is a weighting problem.&#13;
1/ The term "social well-being" is used instead of the more accepted&#13;
economic jargon of "social welfare" because of the extended list&#13;
of arguments in the right hand side and in order to avoid the many&#13;
connotations "welfare" may have.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
3.4       The last problem is at the same time the hardest and easiest&#13;
to solve; for given the fact that interpersonal comparisons of utility&#13;
are impossible at least in a scientific way, i.e., what I like might not&#13;
be what you and others like, the final choice might be done in an arbitrary&#13;
way by the politicians in power. Thus a conservative party might favor&#13;
an educational project that increases efficiency at the expense of some&#13;
equity, whereas a labor party might opt for another project that has the&#13;
opposite social effects.&#13;
3.5       In view of this political normative choice what remains for&#13;
the analyst is the documentation of the sign and size of a project's&#13;
partial effects on the different arguments of the social well-being&#13;
function.&#13;
3.6       This is exactly what we try to do in this paper regarding higher&#13;
education, in general, and the vocational-technical orientation of the&#13;
curriculum, in particular. In the remainder of this section we shall try&#13;
to summarize the state of our knowledge in this area and in the following&#13;
sections we shall bring together additional data to throw light on the&#13;
issues at stake.&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
3.7       The term "efficiency" has at least two different meanings when&#13;
used in education.  One meaning refers to the internal efficiency of an   1/&#13;
educational institution to educate the pupils and turn out its graduates. -&#13;
The other meaning refers to the external efficiency of the institution,&#13;
e.g. how its graduates fit in the social setting after they leave school,&#13;
in comparison with the resources used while in school. 2/&#13;
3.8       External efficiency is a stricter test than internal efficiency&#13;
simply because the latter does not necessarily imply the former. For&#13;
example, a given school might be very efficient at turning out graduates,&#13;
yet its graduates might not be well rewarded in the labor market, thus not&#13;
passing the external efficiency test.&#13;
3.9       Here we are interested in both the internal and external effi-&#13;
ciency of educational establisluments. Internal efficiency is usually&#13;
analyzed by the "cost-effectiveness" technique, whereas external efficiency&#13;
by the "cost-benefit" technique. The first technique compares differential&#13;
costs for producing a given output, whereas the second technique pays&#13;
attention to both costs and the kind of output produced.&#13;
3.10      Another distinction regarding external efficiency is that it&#13;
can be analyzed by means of micro or macro-economic analysis. Micro&#13;
analysis is performed at the (typical) student or graduate level and&#13;
1/ The analytical tool for studying internal efficiency is the&#13;
"educational production function," e.g., see Hanushek (1979).&#13;
2/ For the conceptual origins of this approach, see Becker, (1964).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15 -&#13;
takes the form of the "net present value" or the "rate of return" to&#13;
investment in a given level or kind of educational institution&#13;
(Psacharopoulos, 1973). Macro analysis on the other hand takes the&#13;
form of education's contribution to the country's economic growth rate&#13;
(Denison, 1967). Since macro-efficiency must be founded on micro-&#13;
efficiency, the emphasis in this paper will be on the latter.&#13;
3.11      What do we know of the social efficiency effects of education?&#13;
Regarding the three main educational levels we know well that the lower&#13;
levels are much more cost-efficient relative to the higher levels.&#13;
What is perhaps not so obvious, is the fact that there exist tremendous&#13;
differences between developed and less developed countries in the relative&#13;
cost structure: whereas in advanced countries one university student&#13;
costs 18 times as much as a primary school student, the corresponding&#13;
figure is 88 in developing countries (see Table 3.1).&#13;

3.12      Of course the differential input structure means little unless&#13;
one puts a price on the output as well and thus arrives at an external&#13;
efficiency measure of education. What we know on this front is that the&#13;
lower levels of education are more efficient relative to the higher levels;&#13;
and that the economic returns of education are higher in the developing&#13;
countries group (see Table 3.2).&#13;

Equit'&#13;
3.13      There exist several ways by which the provision of education&#13;
contributes to equality (or inequality) in a given society. In the first&#13;
place it affects upward social mobility and hence it helps particular&#13;
population groups to move occupationally or geographically in the desired&#13;
direction from the point of view of national well-being. This fact has&#13;
been well-documented in both industrial and non-industrial countries.&#13;
Consider as an example the United Kingdom case depicted in Figure 3.1&#13;
where upward (or downward) social mobility significantly relates to tiny&#13;
differences in educational attainment. Also, consider the Ugandan case&#13;
depicted in Figure 3.2 where educational variables (attainment level and&#13;
academic performance) are associated with large path coefficients leading&#13;
to occupational attainment.&#13;

3.14      The second effect of education on equity is via changes of the&#13;
earnings structure or the number of people belonging to a given income&#13;
class. In practically every society in the world there exists a neat&#13;
sitratification of earnings by educational level. As shown in Table 3.3,&#13;
d:Lfferences in earnings are more pronounced in developing countries.&#13;

3.15      What this structure means is that by providing more education to,&#13;
say, a primary school graduate, this person moves to the secondary school&#13;
category with higher earnings and hence income distribution changes. The&#13;
impact of education on income distribution is likely to be stronger in&#13;
developing countries because of the larger earnings differentials associated&#13;
with education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 &#13;
3.16      The impact of education on income distribution has been exten-&#13;
sively researched in both the industrial and non-industrial world. Thus,&#13;
the grand conclusion of Mincer's (1974) work for the United States is&#13;
that human capital variables account for as much as 50% of the variance&#13;
of logarithmic earnings (which is a measure of income distribution).&#13;
This finding has been more or less confirmed in a number of other&#13;
countries (Psacharopoulos 1977c, and Psacharopoulos and Layard 1979).&#13;
3.17      Still another class of analyses relating to the impact of school-&#13;
ing on equity are the ones known as the "Hansen and Weisbrod" (1969) type.&#13;
These relate the social cost of financing higher education to "who pays&#13;
for it." Initial analyses have shown that the present system of finance&#13;
of higher education is inequitable in the sense it results in a net trans-&#13;
fer from the poor to the rich. However, this proposition cannot be gener-&#13;
alized since in developing countries the direct tax base is relatively&#13;
small and therefore the Hansen-Weisbrod argument might not apply. Also,&#13;
later evidence has been rather mixed (see Pechman, 1970 and Jallade, 1974).&#13;
Employment&#13;
3.18      The employment argument of the social well-being function links&#13;
directly (or could be relegated) to the efficiency argument, since unem-&#13;
ployment is tantamount to inefficiency. However, the tremendous rise of&#13;
unemployment throughout the world since the early 1970s has lead to the&#13;
treatment of the employment problem as an issue on its own.&#13;
3.19      That education is somehow related to employment is shown in&#13;
Table 3.4 where one observes a clear bulge of unemployment corresponding&#13;
to secondary school graduates. There have been attempts to explain this&#13;
phenomenon either in economic, supply and demand "mismatch"terms or in&#13;
sociological "aversion for manual work" terms (see ILO, 1971).&#13;

3.20      But L3yond its incidence, unemployment has another important&#13;
dimension, which is duration. Statistics on this issue and how it&#13;
relates to education are still very scarce. What seems to be known,&#13;
however, is that unemployment is heaviest among the young, and that&#13;
higher education graduates might search for a long period before accept-&#13;
ing a job. This behavior has again been explained on economic, private&#13;
cost-benefit grounds (see Blaug, et al. 1969).&#13;
Social Demand&#13;
3.21      Education is not only provided for manpower creation.  A signif-&#13;
icant and overlapping component of it takes the form of consumption&#13;
benefits over the educated person's lifetime. Even in the face of wide-&#13;
spread unemployment among graduates, some prospective students might wish&#13;
to take their chance. Or, some people, especially women, may wish to&#13;
obtain a ;iven degree although they might have no intention whatsoever&#13;
of participating in the labor force. This individual pressure is known&#13;
in the literature as "social demand for education," although in our&#13;
particular context we may well label it "freedom to choose" for the student&#13;
and his family.&#13;
3.22      Social demand has risen world wide, partly because of rising&#13;
incomes and expectations. Several governments have been obliged to insti-&#13;
tute a numerus clausus given their inability to finance an 9xpanded&#13;
educational system. Table 3.5 shows the degree of difficulty of entering&#13;
a university in a number of countries. Of course this difficulty is higher&#13;
the less developed the country.&#13;

3.23      Social demand satisfaction has been both a substantive problem as&#13;
well as a modern political goal throughout the world. Since no educational&#13;
policymaker can ignore this factor, we have elevated it to a separate argu-&#13;
ment in the social well-being function.&#13;
&#13;

Flexibility&#13;
3.24      The world we live in keeps changing at an ever accelerated pace.&#13;
New machines dethrone old machines and the silicon chip revolution is&#13;
still underway with yet unpredictable social effects. In view of the&#13;
uncertainty of future technological change, human resources must be such&#13;
as to quickly adapt to changed demands. 1/ Rigid preparation for a fixed&#13;
occupational role is a thing of the past. Today, the onus is on the&#13;
educational system to turn out flexible, adaptable men and women to fit&#13;
a continuously changing world.&#13;
3.25      This is a recurring issue in the literature and there certainly&#13;
does not exist a generally accepted operational solution on how to achieve&#13;
this. We shall come back to this issue when discussing the relative merits&#13;
of different subjects in Section VII. Suffice it to mention here that the&#13;
degree of an educational policy's contribution to human resources flexibil-&#13;
ity is a must-item in a country's social well-being function. Of course,&#13;
"flexibility" might be considered as just the other side of "employability."&#13;
However, I have chosen to discuss the two concepts separately as to make&#13;
explicit the importance of career changing possibilities df given higher&#13;
education subjects.&#13;

SECTION IV&#13;
AN ANATOMY OF UNIVERSITY COSTS&#13;
4.1       Although educational costs represent only one side of the&#13;
balance sheet drawn up for making school investment decisions, they are&#13;
a major item to be considered before any such decision is taken. There&#13;
e!xist two main reasons for this. In the first place, the other side of&#13;
the balance sheet, i.e., the educational benefits, is too elusive and&#13;
might be altogether neglected. This is serious in itself, but this is&#13;
how educational policy has proceeded for centuries. To put it in modern&#13;
terms, the technique of cost-effectiveness analysis is used instead of&#13;
cost-benefit analysis. Second, every government in the world operates&#13;
utnder a budget constraint. Regardless of the size and nature of benefits,&#13;
aLn educational project will not be implemented unless the funds exist.&#13;
T'herefore, cost scrutinization and analysis of the true social resource&#13;
burden associated with school expansion or creation of new facilities&#13;
is of primordial importance in educational planning.&#13;
Wrhat Cost?&#13;
4.2       The reason the word "true" was underlined in the previous&#13;
sentence is that there exist several kinds of costs, and one should be&#13;
extremely careful what cost to use for what purpose. For example, if&#13;
one is considering the capacity expansion of a particular school, does&#13;
one look at the average or the marginal cost, the direct or the indirect&#13;
cost, the accounting or the opportunity cost, the public or the private&#13;
cost, the ex-post or the ex-ante cost, the fixed or the variable cost?&#13;
Or, perhaps, some other kind of cost? 1/ No one would disagree that&#13;
costs in educational planning should be reckoned in real rather than&#13;
nominal terms. However, there are two different (and cumulative) ways&#13;
one can assess the real cost of education. The obvious one, in tracing&#13;
cost developments over time, is to correct for inflation.  The other&#13;
one, especially when making cross-country comparisons as those attempted&#13;
below, is to relate the deflated cost to the particular country's real&#13;
resources. A US$2,000 cost per university student in a developing&#13;
country represents a much bigger claim on its resources relative to a&#13;
similar nominal cost in a developed country.  Hence, a per capita&#13;
.income--deflated cost per student might refer to a more demanding concept&#13;
of "real" cost of higher education and it is in this sense it will be&#13;
used later in this paper.&#13;
4.3       The two key issues we are interested in in this paper are,&#13;
ifirst, are there returns to scale from university expansion, namely,&#13;
does the real social cost per student decrease as enrollment increases?&#13;
Second, are there any significant differences in costs by field of&#13;
specialization, or, in what subjects could university expansion take&#13;
place at a minimal cost? In the remainder of this section we shall&#13;
:Look at evidence of the returns to scale associated with university&#13;
expansion. The next section presents evidence on the cost of the&#13;
university subject mix.&#13;
1/ For theoretical and empirical analyses of educational costs, see&#13;
Coombs and Hallak (1972); IIEP (1972); Vaizey, et al. (1972);&#13;
Bottomley (1972); and Verry and Davies (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Returns to Scale From University Expansion&#13;
4.4       Evidence on the behavior of unit costs as student numbers in&#13;
higher education rise can come from two basic sources: first,&#13;
international cross-sectional data, and, second, within a given country&#13;
time-series data. Although our main interest is developing countries,&#13;
cost figures from developed countries have also been included for two&#13;
reasons. First, on the macro analysis (i.e. returns to scale) developed&#13;
countries' figures give an order of magnitude of where developing countries&#13;
head to. Second, on the micro analysis, developing country data might&#13;
be more reliable on the relative cost structure by subject.&#13;
A. International Cross-Section Evidence&#13;
4.5       Let us start from the Unesco data.  These have the great dis-&#13;
advantage of low comparability across countries because of differential&#13;
definitions of higher education and coverage (e.g., the cost sometimes&#13;
refers only to central government expenditure). However, they have the&#13;
advantage of sample size and are useful at least for establishing world&#13;
wide patterns.&#13;
4.6       On the basis of Unesco's Statistical Yearbook 1977 and earlier&#13;
years, it was possible to compile cost and higher education enrollment&#13;
data for 83 countries (see Appendix A). The data mostly refer to year&#13;
1975. However, in some cases it was necessary to go back as far as 1970&#13;
in order to match enrollment data to cost data. The cost data refer&#13;
only to recurrent expenditure because the capital expenditure proved too&#13;
erratic from year to year in order to make possible a meaningful statisti-&#13;
cal analysis. On the basis of these data the following variables were&#13;
constructed:&#13;
AC, the average cost per student in higher education in&#13;
US dollars calculated as&#13;
AC = (Total education budget in local currency)'USHARE&#13;
(E) * Exchange rate&#13;
where USHARE is the share of the education&#13;
budget spent on tertiary education and&#13;
E is tertiary level enrollment&#13;
AC. The "real cost" per student, where Y is the country's&#13;
y   per capita income.  This variable was constructed in&#13;
order to obtain a realistic proxy of the true cost&#13;
per university student relative to the country's&#13;
resources, and&#13;
ER, the tertiary level enrollment ratio.&#13;
The total sample of 83 countries has been divided into 58&#13;
developing countries, 18 developed countries (as a control group), and&#13;
7 oil-producing countries (according to World Bank Tables, 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -,&#13;
4.7       Table 4.1 gives a few summary statistics by country group.  The&#13;
average cost per university 1/ student appears to be three times as high&#13;
in developed countries relative to developing countries.. However, when&#13;
one deflates by per capita income, the real (in this sense) cost per&#13;
student in developing countries is about seven times relative to developed&#13;
countries.&#13;

4.8       There is an important preliminary message coming out of these&#13;
aggregate international statistics: although it appears that university&#13;
expansion is associated with increasing unit costs, the opposite is true&#13;
when the real cost per student is taken into account (see Figure 4.1).&#13;
4.9       A look at the scattergram showing the position of individual&#13;
developing countries reveals a neat L-shaped pattern (see Figure 4.2).&#13;
4.10      The apparent existence of returns to scale has been tested by&#13;
fitting cost functions to different country groups.&#13;
4.11      Two basic alternative specifications of cost functions have&#13;
been used or combinations of them:&#13;
(4.1)     ACi   f (Ei, Zi) and&#13;
(4.2)     AC&#13;
(42-)= f (ER1, Zi)&#13;
where Z  stands for the ith country's standardizing factors.&#13;

4.12      The first specification above corresponds to the textbook concept&#13;
of returns to scale (i.e. average cost per student against the scale of&#13;
enrollments). The second specification is more demanding and perhaps more&#13;
appropriate to the data used. The "returns to scale" in this case refer&#13;
to the possible decline of the real cost per student (in per capita income&#13;
terms) following an increase of the enrollment ratio (rather than absolute&#13;
enrollment). I consider specification (4.2) to be more sensitive relative&#13;
to specification (4.1), since countries differ in many respects other than&#13;
those denoted by Z, and the use of AC/Y and ER provides an effective&#13;
standardization before the two variables are regressed against each other.&#13;
Furthermore, it is easier to interpret the results of specification (4.2)&#13;
for prediction purposes, as done below.&#13;
4.13      All specifications gave meaningful and statistically significant&#13;
results, the details of which are reported in Appendix Tables A.2 and A.3.&#13;
When all countries were used in the regressions, a DC = 1 dummy (if a country&#13;
belongs to the developed country group and 0 otherwise) and a Year 1975 =&#13;
1 dummy (if the country's data refer to 1975) were included (Column 2). For&#13;
greater reliability, however, cost functions were fitted strictly within the&#13;
developing countries' 1975 data group (Columns 3 to 5). Also, total univer-&#13;
sity enrollment was used as an alternative to the university enrollment ratio&#13;
(Column 3 versus Column 4). And since inspection of the,scattergrams revealed&#13;
a nonlinear relationship between costs and enrollment, enrollment squared (ER2)&#13;
and lI(2.ER) terms were introduced in the cost functions for improved statis-&#13;
tical fit. The results could be summarized as follows.&#13;
4.14      The real cost dependent variable specification (Table A.3) gave&#13;
much better results than the nominal cost specification (Table A.2). When&#13;
the real cost function was fitted to the whole sample of countries&#13;
(Table A.3, Column *2) the enrollment variable had the expected negative&#13;
sign and was statistically significant at the 99% level of probability.&#13;
What this means is that the higher the enrollment ratio, the lower the real&#13;
cost per university student (t - ratio = 3.85).&#13;
4.15      The fit improves dramatically by restricting the function to 1975&#13;
developing countries' data. The university enrollment ratio alone explains&#13;
nearly one-third of the variation of the real cost per student (Table A.3,&#13;
Column 3).&#13;
4.16      The use of the hyperbolic specification&#13;
AC = a + b 1&#13;
Y          2-ER&#13;
led to an explanation of 45% of the variation of the cost per university&#13;
student in per capita income terms. Given the nature of the data, this must&#13;
be considered a surprisingly good fit.&#13;
4.17      The use of straight average cost against straight enrollment (E,&#13;
in thousands), enrollment-squared and per capita income (Y/P, as a crude&#13;
standardization for the host of "other" factors in which countries differ)&#13;
gave the following result:&#13;

where enrollment level variable (E) has the expected negative sign and is&#13;
statistically significant (t - ratios in parenthesis). This empirical&#13;
result corresponds to a documentation of a textbook case of returns to&#13;
scale.&#13;
A Simulation of the Expected Returns to Scale&#13;
4.18      The estimated cost functions have been used to smooth out the&#13;
scattergrams and simulate the behavior of university costs as enrollment&#13;
expands. Table 4.2 shows the predicted cost values corresponding to&#13;
different enrollment ratios. The cost per student in per capita income&#13;
terms declines dramatically after, say, an enrollment ratio of 2% to 3%&#13;
anad steadies out thereafter (see Figure 4.3). This corresponds to the&#13;
level of enrollment in countries like Zambia, Congo, Pakistan, Nepal,&#13;
Mauritius, Morocco, El Salvador and Cambodia.  Figure 4.3 portrays a near&#13;
textbook case of falling average cost. What this means is that university&#13;
expansion in countries as those listed above is likely to be associated&#13;
with a much lower unit cost in per capita income terms. It should also&#13;
be noted that when average cost is falling the marginal cost per student&#13;
is lower than the average cost. Increasing returns to scale have also&#13;
been documented in the case of primary and secondary schools (see Chesswas&#13;
anld Hallak, 1972).&#13;

4.19      Several additional experiments were conducted such as excluding&#13;
from the regressions countries where the educational expenditure refers&#13;
only to the central government. Also, alternative algebraic specifications&#13;
were tried of the basic cost function. The results of these experiments,&#13;
however, were not in any significant way different from those presented&#13;
above. Therefore, we may conclude this subsection with the following&#13;
proposition: cross -country evidence points to the existence of substantial&#13;
reduction in university unit costs as the student body increases.&#13;
B. Within Country Evidence&#13;
4.20      Another way of documenting returns to scale is by observing the&#13;
evolution of the cost per student within a given country as university&#13;
enrollment rises (of course, after correction for inflation). Appendix B&#13;
presents such time series for nine countries. In spite of cost fluctuation&#13;
in the case of a few countries, the clear picture that emerges is that of&#13;
a falling cost per student in constant prices. This is depicted in&#13;
Figure 4.5 for the case of Ghana.&#13;

An annual increment in enrollments of about 12% is associated with a fall&#13;
of 5% in unit cost. The only two recorded exceptions are minor, and a&#13;
developed country case (France) confirms the general trend observed in&#13;
developing countries. 1/&#13;

4.22      Here is another example from a country at an intermediate level&#13;
of development. The institution of a number of new universities in Portugal&#13;
in the early 1970s provides a clinical case of the operation of returns to&#13;
scale (see Table 4.4). As enrollments multiplied by nearly 15 times in&#13;
a four year period, the cost per student in real terms dropped to less than&#13;
one-fifth of its value within this relatively short time span.&#13;

4.23      One word of caution is in order at this point.  The documented&#13;
fall in unit costs might not only reflect returns to scale, but also a fall&#13;
in the quality of education provided by university institutions. Since&#13;
some deterioration of quality might accompany rapid university expansion&#13;
(say, because of a drained pool of good teachers), it would be incorrect&#13;
to attribute the full cost reduction to returns to scale, especially in&#13;
countries like Portugal or Egypt. But there exists evidence for advanced&#13;
countries where one could reasonably argue quality has remained constant&#13;
while unit costs have decreased. 1/&#13;
1/ For example, see the detailed cost analyses conducted at the United&#13;
Kingdom, University of Bradford, Dunworth and Bottomley (1974). It&#13;
is reminded, however, that it is extremely difficult to differentiate&#13;
between quality changes and returns to scale in the general economic&#13;
literature (see Griliches, 1964).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SECTION V&#13;
COSTING THE SUBJECT MIX&#13;
5.1       In the previous section we documented the fact that as university&#13;
enrollment expands the cost per student falls. "Enrollment" in that case&#13;
referred to the student body as a whole, not differentiated by the field&#13;
of specialization. The purpose of this section is to go deeper into the&#13;
analysis of university costs by reference to the subject or faculty mix.&#13;
Are certain faculties cheaper than others, and if yes, by how much?&#13;
5.2       The issue is important for a policymaker who might wish (say, on&#13;
political grounds) to expand the capacity of higher education based on&#13;
cost-effectiveness analysis (i.e., without reference to university benefits).&#13;
Is he going to expand the capacity of the engineering schools or that of&#13;
social sciences? Knowledge of the relative cost structure will help him&#13;
to make an informed decision.&#13;
Subject Categorization&#13;
5.3       Upon embarking on an analysis of this nature it is very tempting&#13;
to cluster fields of specialization into different groups, such as general&#13;
versus technical. But whereas this distinction is easy at the secondary&#13;
educational level it becomes very difficult with reference to higher educa-&#13;
tion. The reason is that a given course of study has many attributes, and&#13;
many of these atrributes overlap with those of other subjects so as to make&#13;
a watertight distinction in this respect virtually impossible. Consider&#13;
for example the "vocationality" of a given subject, i.e. whether it leads&#13;
to a specific occupation, the degree of "technicality" involved in the&#13;
training, the use or not of laboratories, the nature of "licensing," if&#13;
any, after graduation and the possibility of later in life mobility from&#13;
a non-career-specific education (e.g. liberal arts) to a specific vocation&#13;
(e.g. para-medical personnel) after following on-the-job training.&#13;
5.4       Given this complexity I have chosen to avoid in this paper a&#13;
strict categorization of subjects and instead present the evidence for&#13;
individual fields of specialization (but see Bennett, Jr., 1967). After&#13;
all, the fields for which evidence exists are not that numerous for a&#13;
summary statistic to be needed. The real issue at stake is the widespread&#13;
belief that developing countries'enrollments are heavily biased toward&#13;
subjects like law, humanities and social sciences at the expense of subjects&#13;
like engineering and agriculture that are allegedly needed for economic&#13;
development.&#13;
The International Cross-section&#13;
5.5       The earlier described 83 country cross-section data base was again&#13;
used to obtain a world pattern of the distribution of university enrollments&#13;
by field of specialization. Table 5.1 shows the mean percentage distribution&#13;
of enrollments in eight main faculties within country groups. This table&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
reveals the rather astonishing fact that there are no sharp differences&#13;
int the share of enrollments by field of study between developed and&#13;
developing countries.  The subjects of social sciences, engineering and&#13;
sciences account for the same share of the student body in the developed&#13;
and developing country groups. Law and agriculture enrollments are more&#13;
heavily represented in developing countries, whereas medicine and educa-&#13;
tion are somehow more pronounced in developed countries.&#13;

5.6       Appendix C contains a compilation of cost data in over thirty&#13;
countries where a subject differentiation was possible. Most data refer&#13;
to developing countries, as this is the focus of the paper. However, some&#13;
dleveloped countries cost cases have been included because of the greater&#13;
reliability of the figures and also as an indication of the likely future&#13;
direction of the university cost structure in developing countries.&#13;
5.7       Table 5.2 summarizes some of the information contained in Appendix C&#13;
:Ln the form of relative cost indices by field of specialization. Of course,&#13;
these indices are highly crude and are offered for the sake of data reducti6n.&#13;
But all indices point in one direction. Namely, subjects involving technical&#13;
:Laboratories or readily leading to licensed occupations are several times&#13;
as expensive as non-vocational arts subjects. This proposition is true in&#13;
developed countries as well as in developing countries.&#13;
5.8       The corresponding relative cheapness of arts or social sciences&#13;
applies to both recurrent and capital expenditures (see illustrative examples&#13;
in Figures 5.1 and 5.2).&#13;

5.9       The reason faculties such as agriculture, engineering and&#13;
sciences are more expensive than others is the use of costly laboratory&#13;
space and a lower student-teacher ratio. (For documented examples&#13;
see Appendix C, especially Tables C.4, C.9 and C.14.)&#13;
5.10      The relative expensiveness of the technical curriculum also&#13;
extends to the secondary level. Table 5.3 contains several country exam-&#13;
ples where secondary technical education is on the average more than twice&#13;
as expensive as the secondary general stream. Also, in his study of New&#13;
York City High Schools, Taussing (1968) documented "the lack of success&#13;
of vocational training in increasing the market productivity of the gradu-&#13;
ates, despite the large incremental costs shown to be devoted to vocational&#13;
training relative to alternative high school programs" (p. 59). The same&#13;
conclusion was reached by Corazzini (1968) in his analysis of vocational&#13;
versus general high schools in Worcester, Massachusetts: "The program&#13;
of vocational education for boys .... was, at best, only marginally&#13;
profitable" (p. 120).&#13;

5.11      One special case worth mentioning is that of non-university post-&#13;
secondary institutions. As a rule of thumb, these institutions are heavily&#13;
vocationally-oriented, mostly offer an agricultural curriculum and are very&#13;
expensive, even when compared with universities. 1/ These institutions are&#13;
relatively new and not enough data exists to compile for them a table similar&#13;
to Table 5.2. However, a close examination of the Portuguese case may help&#13;
demonstrate the point. Table 5.4 shows that non-university status higher&#13;
education institutions in Portugal have a higher unit cost than most univer-&#13;
sities in the country, and that this unit cost nearly matches that of the&#13;
prestigious University of Coimbra.&#13;
l/ For example, the cost per student place of the two World Bank-financed&#13;
National Institutes of Mechanical Engineering in Algeria (Setif and&#13;
Tiaset) exceeds 30,000 in 1978 US$ (See Table C.24).&#13;

5.12      Reference to Table 5.5 shows that these institutions are not only&#13;
expensive, but also the law of returns to scale operates in reverse with&#13;
respect to them. A drop in enrollments between 1975 and 1979 in these&#13;
institutions resulted in a nearly threefold increase in unit costs.&#13;
Appendix C also gives evidence on the relative cost struct4re by subject&#13;
in selected advanced countries. These data permit a finer distinction&#13;
between marginal cost and average cost by subject.&#13;

Some Developed Countries Evidence&#13;
5.13      The developed countries data presented in Appendix C confirm the&#13;
cost structure revealed in developing countries, namely the cost of science-&#13;
related subjects is a multiple of arts-related subjects, (e.g. see Tables&#13;
C.32 and C.37). Marginal cost is lower than average cost, reflecting&#13;
returns to scale within subject areas (see Table C.5). One result is&#13;
especially worth pointing at: the cost per student of social sciences is&#13;
not only lower than, say, engineering, but also its marginal cost is a&#13;
smaller fraction of average cost (see Figure 5.3), and what is essentially&#13;
the same thing, the average cost curve drops faster in the case of social&#13;
sciences relative to engineering (see Figure 5.4).&#13;

5.14      This section's conclusion is that expansion of university&#13;
faculties such as social sciences, humanities and arts is considerably&#13;
cheaper relative to engineering and agriculture. However, this is only&#13;
one-half of the whole picture, i.e. one must examine university benefits,&#13;
a subject to which we now turn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SECTION VI&#13;
EVALUATING THE UNIVERSITY BENEFITS&#13;
6.1       A university could be described as a multi-product firm.  This&#13;
"firm" produces instruction, research, socialization, certification, and&#13;
has other myriad social functions. Evaluation of its "output" becomes&#13;
extremely complex starting from the taxonomic point of view.&#13;
6.2       Some of the benefits produced might be private whereas others&#13;
might be social. Benefits, whether private and/or social, might be&#13;
overlapping, as in the case of instruction and research. The benefits&#13;
might directly affect a group of people in society, but there might&#13;
exist second round (spill-over) indirect effects. Some benefits might&#13;
be of a short-run character while others might have lasting implications.&#13;
And a substantial part of benefits might be non-monetary (see Michael,&#13;
1981).&#13;
6.3       In view of this multiplicity of dimensions, the solution adopted&#13;
in this paper is to divide the university benefits into two categories:&#13;
those benefits that are more or less quantifiable, and the rest. Whereas&#13;
the magnitude of the former could be somehow assessed, the rest would enter&#13;
the calculus as a qualification. For example, if the instructional output&#13;
of a university could be assessed at US$50 million, then the total output&#13;
must be well in excess of this figure when one includes the difficult to&#13;
quantify research output.&#13;
6.4       A quantifiable benefit does not have to be in terms of dollars&#13;
or rupees. If the provision of 10,000 extra university places will change&#13;
the employment situation of graduates by 2%, this is another figure that&#13;
has to enter the quantifiable side of the calculus. The same argument&#13;
applies to the income distribution effects of university provision.&#13;
6.5       In what follows we shall look at two main empirical entities in&#13;
order to trace out the quantifiable university effects: graduate earnings&#13;
and employment conditions. This will be done at two levels; first for the&#13;
university as a whole, and second, by field of specialization.&#13;
Wny Earnings?&#13;
6.6       That one should examine the employment conditions of graduates in&#13;
assessing the quantitative effects of university education, could be taken&#13;
for granted. What is less obvious, if not contestable, is the use of&#13;
graduate earnings.&#13;
6.7       There -are two main reasons the earnings-evidence has been adopted&#13;
in this paper. First, it ties nicely and complements the cost evidence&#13;
presented in the previous section. By comparing costs and benefits one can&#13;
arrive at a summary measure of the economic efficiency of universities.&#13;
(This measure will be presented in the next section.) Second, there do not&#13;
exist many alternatives of how to approximate the elusive university&#13;
benefits. For example, consider one such alternative, namely how well do&#13;
universities prepare educated manpower for filling slots in the occupational&#13;
structure? Following this criterion, one would look for vacancies or&#13;
surpluses of given skills, something we shall do anyway by examining employ-&#13;
ment evidence. Or one would look at the "relevance" of the education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
provided, which is something extremely difficult to measure by objective&#13;
(L.e. non-opinion) tests as there exists no uniform definition of what it&#13;
reBally means.&#13;
Do Earnings Reflect Productivity?&#13;
6.8       The choice of earnings is of course not free of problems in&#13;
iltself, the major objection being that what people are paid may not neces-&#13;
sarily correspond to their true contribution in production. This objec-&#13;
tlon becomes stronger when one considers the fact that the public sector&#13;
iS by far the largest employer of graduates in developing countries, hence&#13;
sailaries are determined institutionally (via the civil service pay scales)&#13;
rather than being based on economic considerations following the operation&#13;
of the free market mechanism.&#13;
6.9       Although this view sounds plausible, it is not entirely true.&#13;
I the first place the public sector has to coupete with the private sector&#13;
in the open market for graduates, hence it cannot offer less than the&#13;
private sector for a graduate of given quality and given job conditions.&#13;
The public sector could certainly afford to pay more relative to the&#13;
private sector, at least at the entry point. However, the differential&#13;
involved cannot be either excessive or last over a long period of time.&#13;
For sooner or later there will be a crisis of one kind or the market check&#13;
will eventually operate.&#13;
6.10      Consider as an example the evidence presented in Table 6.1.&#13;
In most cases graduate level salaries have actually declined between the&#13;
points in time under comparison. Why have not the graduates in these&#13;
African countries pressed for an increasing earnings differential?&#13;

6.11      Also, a recent review of productivity differentials related to&#13;
education concluded as follows: "... the public sector is not a source&#13;
of upward salary pressures..." (Berry, 1980, p. 65). This can be&#13;
clearly seen in Appendix I which contains information on earnings by&#13;
sector of employment in Brazil and Malaysia. University graduates in the&#13;
private sector are paid higher wages than in the public sector (Tables I.1&#13;
to I.3). Also, the returns to education estimated on the basis of public&#13;
sector earnings are lower relative to the returns estimated on the basis&#13;
of private sector earnings (see Tables I.4 and I.5). Therefore, the fear&#13;
of an upward bias of the true returns to education b,ecause of the existence&#13;
of the public sector seems to be exaggerated.&#13;
6.12      The possible discrepancy between observed wages and the social&#13;
product of labor has also been exaggerated. In the first place there is&#13;
a huge overlap between the private and the social product of education.&#13;
It is hard to imagine a case in which what accrues to the individual worker&#13;
is a pure private gain having no social counterpart.&#13;
6.13      The objections often refer to problems of measurement.  Although&#13;
it is impossible to have a satisfactory monetization of. externalities&#13;
associated with education, one can certainly qualify his conclusions in&#13;
a given direction by taking externalities into account. Or one can apply&#13;
"'shadow pricing" in order to measure the true value of different types of&#13;
labor (Psacharopoulos, 1970). Although it is difficult to shadow-price&#13;
civil servants, this technique has been extensively applied in agriculture,&#13;
demonstrating that more educated farmers, other things being equal, produce&#13;
more rice relative to less educated farmers (e.g. see Wu, 1977).&#13;
6.14      Measurement difficulties also exist when assessing the returns to&#13;
physical capital. Consider, as an example, the sensitivity of the rate of&#13;
return to investment in a tractor production plant in Yugoslavia (see&#13;
Appendix Table H.6). An over or underestimation of the benefits side by&#13;
10% can result in a rate of return ranging from -4.4% to 27%.&#13;
6.15      Sometimes the objections to the social dimension of education take&#13;
the form of more specific labels such as ability differentials, screening,&#13;
certification, job competition, bumping, dual labor markets or social class.&#13;
6.16      The ability factor was one of the earliest challenges to the&#13;
approach adopted here. Because those who have more education than others&#13;
allegedly also have a higher level of ability, wage differentials are not&#13;
solely due to learning, a great part of them being due to differential&#13;
ability. This highly intuitive argument combined with some aggregate,&#13;
cross-tabulation evidence by Becker and Denison resulted in the enthrone-&#13;
ment of this myth. 1/ However, micro data plus scrutinization of what&#13;
."ability" really means resulted in the highly counter-intuitive finding&#13;
that ability differentials do not account for much of the variation in&#13;
earnings (see Psacharopoulos, 1975 and Griliches, 1979).&#13;
1/ For a formal analysis of the screening hypothesis see Arrow (1973).&#13;
For empirical tests see Layard and Psacharopoulos (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
6.17      Then there was the so-called screening, or certification, or&#13;
sheepskin argument, namely what schools produce is just diplomas helping&#13;
the holder to get a privately well paid job, although the social payoff&#13;
of the human investment he has undertaken might be minimal. However,&#13;
there exist two major objections to this view:  first, when one makes&#13;
the distinction between "initial" and "persistent" screening, it is&#13;
lvery hard to find evidence corroborating the latter, namely that&#13;
employers keep paying wages above the worker's productivity after they&#13;
have the employee under their observation for some time. 1/ Initial&#13;
screening certainly exists, i.e. employers may hire someone on the&#13;
basis of his expected productivity given his educational qualifications.&#13;
But there is nothing wrong with it as, after all, it has an information-&#13;
al social value. In his review Berry (1980) concluded: "For the&#13;
present one cannot rule out the possibility that the true returns to&#13;
education in most LDCs are rather little affected by such influences..."&#13;
(op. cit, p. 77).&#13;
6.18       Then there was the job competition model, putting forvard&#13;
another highly intuitive notion, i.e. workers compete for jobs rather&#13;
than wages and those with more educational qualifications push out from&#13;
the labor queue the less qualified and get the job. 2/ This is certain-&#13;
ly true. What I have failed to grasp in this model is why this should&#13;
be socially wrong. If the more qualified perform better in the job they&#13;
are in, this is socially healthy. The micro evidence I read tells me&#13;
the latter is likely to be the case as the more qualified earn more&#13;
relative to the less qualified, even after one standardizes for&#13;
occupation.&#13;
6.19       Another attack comes from the so-called dual or segmented&#13;
labor market hypothesis (Gordon, 1972). According to it education&#13;
helps workers belonging to the "primary segment" of the market (i.e.&#13;
those in good jobs), but not those in the "'secondary segment" (i.e.&#13;
those with inferior jobs). .(For a review, see Cain, 1976.) For several&#13;
reasons the dual labor market fashion that started in the early 1970s&#13;
has already faded away, although it is still echoed in some quarters.&#13;
In the first place, testing it is extremely difficult because the&#13;
hypothesis has never been stated in a rigorous manner. Second, the&#13;
definition of the upper or lower segment is a major problem on its&#13;
own. Where should one draw the dividing line between the two alleged-&#13;
ly separate labor markets? Last but not least, empirical attempts to&#13;
test whatever bits and pieces of the theory are testable have failed to&#13;
reject the orthodox functioning of labor markets (see Psacharopoulos,&#13;
1978, and McNabb and Psacharopoulos, 1980).&#13;
6.20       Another commonly held belief is that education serves the&#13;
maintenance of the status quo from generation to generation (Bowles,&#13;
1972). Although this might be t-rue to a large extent, it does not&#13;
constitute a challenge to the use of earnings as a proxy for&#13;
productivity. For two interesting recent results show that, first,&#13;

family background (or social class) has only an indirect effect on earnings&#13;
and this is via education. The direct effect of social background on&#13;
earnings is rather weak. Also, it is those who acquire more education that&#13;
are socially more upwardly mobile (Psacharopoulos, 1977a).&#13;
The Earnings Structure&#13;
6.21       Appendix D contains a set of tables giving examples of the earn-&#13;
ings structure by level of education and, especially, by field of special-&#13;
ization within higher education.&#13;
6.22       As noted earlier, the earnings structure by level of education&#13;
is such that graduates of each successive level earn more than graduates&#13;
of the preceding level. This seems to be a universal truth and applies to&#13;
such diverse countries as Zambia, Sudan, Pakistan and Iran. This proposi-&#13;
tion seems to hold for employed as well as self-employed persons (see&#13;
Tables D.2 and D.3). 1/ To put it schematically, university education has&#13;
the quantifiable and well documented effect of adding a substantial income&#13;
chunk to a control group of non-graduates (see Figure 6.1).&#13;

the different fields of specialization compare in their income-&#13;
generating effect. Information on the relative salaries of graduates&#13;
by subject studied is extremely scanty. However, the material collec-&#13;
ted in Appendix D permitted the construction of Table 6.2.&#13;

The numbers in this table are indices having a base of 100 correspond-&#13;
ing to the all subject average within a given country. These indices&#13;
have been constructed in order to avoid rupees, pesos and other con-&#13;
fusions so that a pattern in the relative earnings structure might be&#13;
detected. In spite of the index conversion, the evidence is very&#13;
mixed for a generalization to be made. The pecking order of relative&#13;
earnings advantage is as follows:&#13;
Agriculture          87&#13;
Sciences            88&#13;
Humanities           93&#13;
Arts                 94&#13;
Economics           103&#13;
Social Sciences    104&#13;
Engineering         106&#13;
Medicine            109&#13;
These averages of course conceal differences between individual&#13;
countries. In most cases, however, agricultural graduates earn sub-&#13;
stantially less than higher education graduates as a whole (Iran being&#13;
the only exception). Also, science graduates earn invariably less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
than the average student body. Contrary to what might be expected (because&#13;
of the non-specificity or technicality of the curriculum), social sciences,&#13;
economics and law graduates are doing rather well in some country settings.&#13;
6.24      This is confirmed by opinion studies of the social desirability&#13;
of given professions in developing countries. For example, in Tanzania,&#13;
social scientists rank among the top most desired professions, whereas&#13;
agriculturalists and natural scientists rank last (see Table D.10).&#13;
6.25      It is also worth noting that nonvocational salaries are not only&#13;
high relative to other subjects, but they also grow faster over time (see&#13;
Table D.8). For example, compare the mid-career to starting salary growth&#13;
in Tanzania:&#13;
Arts             49%&#13;
Engineering      36%&#13;
Medicine         29%&#13;
W4hat this means is that arts graduates, even if they start low, later in&#13;
life they find a niche and their earnings grow faster than, say, engineers.&#13;
Could this be due to the fact that arts graduates are more flexible to&#13;
adapt to new situations, whereas engineering graduates have learned too&#13;
narrow a vocational skill that has no alternative value when technology&#13;
changes? To put it differently, could it be that arts graduates have a&#13;
greater on-the-job learning potential and this is later reflected in the&#13;
lifetime path of their earnings?&#13;
6.26      The evidence presented here is consistent with the hypotheses&#13;
contained in the above questions. However, the small number of observations&#13;
preclude any possible rigorous statistical test of these hypotheses.&#13;
The Employment Structure&#13;
6.27      Appendix E contains a set of tables giving information on the&#13;
employment-unemployment structure of university graduates. The evidence&#13;
relates to two aspects of uneuqployment: incidence and duration. Let us&#13;
examine them in turn.&#13;
6.28      By way of introduction, Table E.1 gives the typical structure of&#13;
unemployment rates-by level of education in developing countries, namely the&#13;
familiar inverted U-shape curve (see Figure 6.2). Unemployment peaks at the&#13;
secondary-college dropout level with an incidence of 15% (in the Philippines&#13;
example) relative to 7% for college graduates. The unemployment rate of&#13;
college graduates is nearly equal to the average unemployment rate in the&#13;
country as a whole and it has remained steady in spite of the tremendous&#13;
expansion of graduates between the early and late 1960s.&#13;
6.29      Table E.2 documents by means of the Singapore case the well known&#13;
-fact that no matter what the incidence of unemployment is, this is a declin-&#13;
ing function of age. Figure 6.3 shows the Zambian case where only a small&#13;
fraction of graduates remained unemployed six months after graduation.&#13;

6.30     This period of unemployment between graduation and first job is&#13;
often misinterpreted as inefficiency of the school system to produce&#13;
graduates "relevant" to the needs of the economy. Today this thesis has&#13;
been weakened for several reasons. First, as we have shown above, the&#13;
period of unemployment is relatively short and the graduate, sooner or&#13;
later, finds a niche. Second, this short waiting period might be healthy&#13;
in terms of the search process (from the point of view of the graduate&#13;
and the employer) that has to go on before either party is committed to&#13;
a contract. Thirdly, it has been proved that this period of "unemployment"&#13;
makes full economic sense when one compares the costs and the benefits of&#13;
waiting: the private returns continue to be advantageous to the individual&#13;
after correction for an initial period of unemployment. 1/&#13;
6.31      But how does the unemployment incidence or duration compare across&#13;
different fields of specialization? Again, the evidence on this front is&#13;
not abundant. 2/ Nevertheless, the material compiled in Appendix E allows&#13;
us to draw up a comparative table (Table 6.3) in this respect. The figures&#13;
shown in this table are indices having a base of 100 corresponding to the&#13;
overall (i.e., all higher education subjects) unemployment rate within a&#13;
given country. A figure above 100 in a given cell signifies an above&#13;
average unemployment rate for the kind of graduate to which it refers.&#13;
Correspondingly, a figure below 100 means a below average unemployment rate.&#13;

6.32      Once more the evidence is very mixed as to be able to draw&#13;
generalizations. Sciences, humanities, economics and arts graduates&#13;
appear to have on the average a higher incidence of unemployment,&#13;
whereas agriculture, engineering, social sciences and law graduates&#13;
are doing better in terms of employment.&#13;
l/  For the most indepth documentation of this fact, see Blaug, et al.,&#13;
(1969), who have solved the apparent puzzle of high rates of graduate&#13;
graduate unemployment in India along with a strong social demand&#13;
for university education.&#13;
2/  Personally, I consider it a pity to have heard so much from differ-&#13;
ent quarters in recent years about "tracer studies," yet not being&#13;
able to trace the results of these studies in the literature.&#13;
However, see Zymelman (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
6.33      Appendix Table E.5 presents another employment-related statistic&#13;
referring to the University of Philippines graduates: the percentage of&#13;
t]hose absorbed five years after graduation in all fields or in their own&#13;
fields. Law, physical science, liberal arts and business administration&#13;
graduates exhibit absorption rates in excess of 90%. Mechanical&#13;
engineering, civil engineering and especially agriculture graduates are&#13;
doing worse in terms of absorption five years after graduation. The&#13;
difference between own-field and all-fields absorption could be given a&#13;
double interpretation. One possible interpretation is social inefficiency&#13;
since a significant proportion of these was obliged to perform another&#13;
Job function (relative to that studied) in order to find employment.&#13;
Another interpretation, however, is that absorption in other fields&#13;
reflects flexibility in adapting to new situations. In this respect it&#13;
is interesting to note that liberal arts graduates exhibit a higher all-&#13;
fields absorption (95%) relative to their own field (81%).&#13;
6.34      Appendix Table E.8 contains evidence of a similar nature.  The&#13;
incidence of unemployment (or unknown destination) is highest among agri-&#13;
cultural graduates of non-university institutions.&#13;
Income Distribution&#13;
6.35      Any policy that changes the relative reward structure in a given&#13;
society automatically has an impact on income distribution. The provision&#13;
of university education is such an action, as it clearly elevates the&#13;
person who receives it to a higher income. Since graduates have incomes&#13;
above the population average, it has been claimed that the provision of&#13;
tniversity education is inequitable: a group of persons will now be pushed&#13;
iLnto the above-average income class and income distribution might become&#13;
worse. 1/ Another sense in which the provision of higher education might&#13;
run against equity is the Hansen and Weisbrod (1969) finance argument,&#13;
niamely the average taxpayer subsidizing the offspring of the elite class&#13;
who attend colleges.&#13;
6.36      These are hot theoretical, empirical (and also, political) issues&#13;
and the role of education as a whole on income distribution is still a&#13;
highly contested one (e.g. see Pechman, 1970).&#13;
Some Additional Dimensions&#13;
6.37      Appendix F contains a set of tables with pieces of evidence point-&#13;
ing towards further advantages of nonvocational subjects. Thus Table F.1&#13;
shows that wastage rates in Zambia are much lower in the humanities (19%)&#13;
relative to engineering faculties (40%). The capacity utilization of post-&#13;
secondary non-university vocational schools is especially low in Sierra Leone&#13;
(Table F.2), and the same remark applies to secondary vocational schools in&#13;
El Salvador (Table F.3). A World Bank review of 42 case studies revealed&#13;
the fact that general universitv faculties are on the average 40% overutil-&#13;
ized, whereas technical and agricultural faculties are severely underutil-&#13;
ized (see Table F.4). The same applies to secondary education distinguished&#13;
by cUrriculum type. The high wastage and low utilization of technical-&#13;
vocational faculties is indicative of social inefficiency.&#13;
1/  For a discussion and empirical analysis of this issue see Marin and&#13;
Psacharopoulos, 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
6.38      The development of local capacity in general subjects has&#13;
a considerable foreign exchange savings potential. Obsession with&#13;
vocational subjects can lead to unsatisfied demand for sociology,&#13;
psychology and related fields, thus to study abroad (see Table F.7).&#13;
For example, because of numerus clausus one-fifth of all Greek higher&#13;
education students are attending colleges abroad at a considerable&#13;
cost in foreign exchange.&#13;
6.39      The development of university capacity has further local-&#13;
ization benefits. For example, Zambia had only 108 African graduates&#13;
at the time of independence in 1965 (Sanyal, et al. 1976, p. 57). By&#13;
1971, 88% of secondary school teachers continued to be non-Zambian&#13;
(Ibid., p. 60). Aklilu Habte (1974) reports the proportion of&#13;
Ethiopian staff at Haile Selassie University changed from 34% to 57%&#13;
between 1962 and 1973. It is in situations like thes-e that university&#13;
expansion could be considered an overriding goal providing definite&#13;
benefits that are extremely difficult to quantify.&#13;

SECTION VII&#13;
A CASE FOR NON-VOCATIONAL UNIVERSITY EXPANSION&#13;
7.1       In the previous sections we have separately examined the costs&#13;
and benefits of university education. The purpose of this section is to&#13;
pull the two threads together in order to arrive at some social efficiency&#13;
mleasure of higher education. This will be done in two steps. First, an&#13;
assessment will be made of the economic efficiency of higher education as&#13;
a whole, and second, we shall discuss the efficiency of particular higher&#13;
education subjects.&#13;
The Economic Efficiency of University Education&#13;
7.2       It might be recalled earlier in this paper we mentioned that higher&#13;
education is socially very expensive relative to other levels, especially&#13;
in developing countries. The material collected in Appendix C fully confirms&#13;
this picture. According to summary Table 7.1, the relative unit cost struc-&#13;
ture between the primary (=1), secondary and tertiary educational levels is&#13;
als follows:&#13;
Developing Countries:         I : 3.5 : 16.1&#13;
One Developed Country&#13;
Example (France):             1 : 3.1 : 4.4&#13;
This often documented relative expensiveness of higher education understand-&#13;
ably makes it vulnerable to a low priority in state budgetary allocations,&#13;
if not to direct cuts.&#13;

7.3       Of course this view is one-sided.  Budgetary decisions cannot&#13;
be taken on the basis of costs alone. The benefits side must be examined&#13;
as well. Now, the problem with education in general is that the benefits&#13;
side cannot be made as explicit as the cost side, hence the Finance&#13;
Minister is usually more articulate than the Education Minister in claiming&#13;
funds.&#13;
7.4       Several attempts have been made in the literature to document&#13;
the benefits side of education, and earlier in this paper we have made an&#13;
effort to increase the available data set, especially on the subject&#13;
breakdown.&#13;
7.5       When costs and benefits are brought together a completely differ-&#13;
ent picture emerges regarding the priority of higher education vis-a-vis&#13;
other sectors. 1/&#13;
7.6       Table 7.2 summarizes evidence on the economic returns to higher&#13;
education and physical capital in a number of countries. One cannot over-&#13;
emphasize the fact that there exist comparability problems both within and&#13;
between countries. However, there is no reason to suppose that biases&#13;
exist in only one direction rather than another as to make the attempted&#13;
comparison meaningless. There exist as many problems in estimating the&#13;
returns to investment in physical capital as for estimating the returns&#13;
to human capital.&#13;

7. 7      The summary picture that emerges is that the returns to higher&#13;
education in developing countries are higher than returns to physical&#13;
capital (14.9% versus 12.8%, respectively). In nine out of the eleven&#13;
developing country cases listed in Table 7.2, the returns to investing&#13;
in universities are higher than the returns to investing in machines.&#13;
Also, in reviewing the returns to education versus physical capital,&#13;
Vian Ginneken (1980, p. 27) comments as follows: "All ... estimates&#13;
indicate that both the private and social rates of return are highest&#13;
for the fifth and sixth year of primary education and the fourteenth&#13;
to sixteenth year of schooling (university). These rates of return&#13;
vary between 25 and 50 per cent, which is well above the rate of return&#13;
on physical capital (between 15 to 20 percent)" (italics mine).&#13;
7.8       Of course, given the latitude within which both kinds of returns&#13;
must lie, one cannot say with precision that the relative advantage of&#13;
universities is 2.1 percentage points. But one thing is for sure: the&#13;
returns to higher education are in many cases at least as high as the&#13;
returns to other projects in the economy such as highways, power plants&#13;
cr irrigation (see Appendix H).&#13;
7.9       Table 7.2 contains another interesting feature.  When reference&#13;
is made to advanced countries, the returns to the two types of projects&#13;
follow an inverse pattern. Namely, physical capital projects in developed&#13;
countries seem to have an advantage of 1.2 percentage points relative to&#13;
higher education. Also, the returns to both types of projects are lower&#13;
in developed countries relative to developing countries. Both patterns&#13;
are fully consistent with economic theory. Namely, one would expect that&#13;
given the relatively higher capital stock (both material and human) in&#13;
developed countries relative to developing countries, the level of returns&#13;
in the former would be lower than in the latter. Also, the relatively&#13;
hiigher human-to-material capital ratio in developed countries has caused&#13;
a relative depression of the returns to university education. Of course&#13;
l:hese are partial explanations and by no means sufficient conditions&#13;
for the observed patterns. However, they point toward what one would&#13;
axpect from economic theory.&#13;
7.10      The just over one percentage point difference between the two&#13;
kinds of returns in developed countries should not be taken literally&#13;
as it might be due to small number, sampling or methodological estimation&#13;
differences. But again, one cannot resist the economic explanation that&#13;
both kinds of investment in developed countries have proceeded to the&#13;
point of near equalization of returns at the margin.&#13;
The Returns by Field of Specialization&#13;
7.11      Having established that the economic returns to higher education&#13;
as a whole are at least of the same order of magnitude as the returns to&#13;
other forms of investment, we now ask the question of what are the differ-&#13;
ential returns to specific subjects within higher education itself.&#13;
7.12      The material collected in Appendix G permits us to draw up a&#13;
summary Table 7.3 on the returns to higher education by subject in a number&#13;
of developed and developing countries.&#13;

7.13         The picture that emerges  is as  follows:   in most  cases,  the&#13;
returns to different subjects are of the same (if not higher) order of&#13;
magnitude as the returns to alternative projects (see Appendix H).&#13;
Second, it is sometimes the case that general subjects such as humanities&#13;
and economics  are financidlly more profitable  than  technical  subjects&#13;
like engineering and agriculture. This is because the higher cost of the&#13;
latter kind of subjects outweighs their apparent higner benefits (see&#13;
Appendix D). This proposition holds in both developed and developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
7.14         The case  of agricultural  specialization deserves  special mention&#13;
as this subject exhibits the lowest social returns in developing countries.&#13;
In terms of averages, the pecking order of returns in some fields is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Agriculture             8.0%&#13;
Medicine              12.2%&#13;
Economics             15.0%&#13;
Law                   16.2%&#13;
7.15         That  the returns  to particular higher  education subjects  are&#13;
competitive with alternative returns is shown by citing the following&#13;
examples from the yields from other sectors. 1/&#13;
Railways              15.6%&#13;
Power Plants            8.5%&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Further Considerations&#13;
7.16      This conclusion was strictly based on the efficiency argument&#13;
among the criteria for social choice discussed in Section III, above.&#13;
Expanding the criteria list could only strengthen the case for non-&#13;
vocational higher education.&#13;
7.17      Thus in the previous section we have documented the fact that&#13;
it is superficial to think the provision of higher education will result&#13;
in a score of unemployed graduates. When one considers not only the&#13;
incidence of unemployment but also its duration, any related adjustment&#13;
of the above efficiency measure is likely to become trivial. This&#13;
proposition holds for all kinds of subjects.&#13;
7.18      But the field of specialization controversy might be a lot&#13;
more subtle than the quantitative evidence presented thus far. It is&#13;
for this reason we now extend the inquiry to the non-quantitative domain.&#13;
This is done in the following section by reference to a variety of&#13;
curricula and sociological paradigms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
SECTION VIII&#13;
LIBERAL EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?&#13;
8.1       The desirability of liberal education programs in developing&#13;
countries, particularly at university level, is less than self-evident&#13;
for the following reasons: first, the "common sense" viewpoint that,&#13;
given competing claims on investment resources, vocational programs&#13;
should be given overwhelming priority; and second, anxiety concerning the&#13;
social distribution of liberal university education in a variety of&#13;
cultural settings. Liberal education might in some circumstances appear&#13;
elitist' or even to offer a kind of civilized self-indulgence to a small&#13;
section of the population, and thus to be unrelated to development, the&#13;
most tangible product of which is held to be economic advance.&#13;
8.2       This nonquantitative section argues from different premises.&#13;
Its underlying thesis is that a "general" element is needed to function&#13;
alongside vocational education, and that the interrelationship of the&#13;
entire educational provision is the real object of policy.&#13;
8.3       Education, liberal or otherwise, is not a random activity.  It&#13;
is intentional, goal directed. A few such goals, at their crudest, might&#13;
be delineated as follows:&#13;
(i) Instrumental skills, such as literacy and numeracy.&#13;
(ii) The omnibus of social, cultural and industrial roles&#13;
generated by society.&#13;
(iii) Personal autonomy and self-realization.&#13;
(iv) Social education, and in particular, personal&#13;
adaptability to social, cultural and technological&#13;
change.&#13;
8.4       All of these objectives should be represented in a defensible&#13;
educational program at all levels. To some extent, therefore, the&#13;
vocational versus liberal choice might be a false dichotomy, since any&#13;
society will "balance" provision, perhaps differently at different&#13;
levels. 1/&#13;
8.5       Instrumental skills are "liberal" in spirit, purporting to&#13;
develop a flexible underlying competence in the symbolic systems necessary&#13;
for the development and maintenance of a complex society. Some of the&#13;
work done at university level, like the ability to conceptualize policy-&#13;
related problems or the ability to criticize legal arguments, might be&#13;
just a tertiary level equivalent of a basic literacy program.&#13;
1/ In advanced countries there is a tendency, also, for institutional&#13;
specialization, although this is breaking down. In England, for&#13;
example, the universities largely represent a tradition of "pure"&#13;
knowledge; the polytechnics mainly represent a tradition of&#13;
vocational education; and the technical colleges specialize in&#13;
vocational training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
13.6      Philosophers of knowledge have attempted clustering disciplines&#13;
by reference to their logical characteristics, as "forms of knowledge"&#13;
or "realms of meaning." Indeed, one widely-held view of liberal education&#13;
writhin this tradition is that man is liberated by systematic induction&#13;
iLnto these broad forms of thought. The notion of knowledge-put-in-use&#13;
introduces another pedagogical model, that of the "integrated field" in&#13;
which a number of contributing disciplines are brought to bear upon&#13;
social, technical or developmental problems (King and Brownell, 1966;&#13;
Hlusgrave, 1973).&#13;
8.7       Part of the legacy of liberal education is the role it plays in&#13;
training individuals to be adaptive intellectually (Archambault, 1965;&#13;
Curle, 1963). That is, it defines its students as future social change&#13;
lgents, based in part on what Hardison (1972) has called "the critical&#13;
values of openness, toleration and measured skepticism." This model&#13;
has clear relevance for the developing countries, particularly as outside-&#13;
iLnitiated, technically-led innovation is likely to run into problems of&#13;
tissue-rejection.  Unless there is cultural development, technical develop-&#13;
mient may be wasted, or even counterproductive (Watson, 1969).&#13;
Trhe Technology-Led Advance: A Critique of the Paradigm&#13;
8.8       The main assumption behind the practice of foreign aid has been&#13;
that the supply of Western technical manpower and expertise to the develop-&#13;
iLng countries would somehow give birth to a technological infrastructure&#13;
that would put the developing countries firmly on the road to development.&#13;
Technological development, as the social scientists have been arguing since&#13;
the early 1960s, is a complex process that cannot be considered in isolation.&#13;
It is now generally admitted that development implies more than the overt&#13;
aicceptance of material and technical improvements. Both aid-donors and&#13;
aid-receivers are increasingly becoming aware that, unless the social&#13;
tmechanisms of change are considered in their totality, the chances of&#13;
success are greatly reduced, no matter how adequate is the provision of&#13;
social and physical infrastructures (markets, credit-agencies, irrigation&#13;
schemes, transport, etc.). It is also becoming apparent that some kinds of&#13;
experience cannot be transmitted the way technical skills are and must be&#13;
generated within the social structures of the societies to be developed.&#13;
13.9      The realization that the targets of economic development have a&#13;
human capital dimension is not a new discovery. It has often been pointed&#13;
out that large numbers of technocrats will not turn into responsible&#13;
lpolicymakers; that what is needed is people who can formulate, understand&#13;
and support purposeful, principled and courageous policies. An initial&#13;
argument can be put for a liberal educational program to encourage the&#13;
cultural autonomy and flexible wisdom of future policymakers.&#13;
83.10     One should express skepticism  regarding the vocationalist&#13;
iapproach to higher education. The belief that there should be a close link&#13;
between the content of study and subsequent employment has severe&#13;
Limitations. Perhaps educational requirements of developing countries are&#13;
idifferent from those in developed countries and the experience of the latter&#13;
on matters of educational policy is not necessarily relevant for the former.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Perhaps education in developing countries should be adapted to the specific&#13;
economic requirements of these countries, the explicit assumption being that&#13;
knowledge generated outside the developing countries can be tailored to fit&#13;
these requirements. However, several arguments stand in contrast to this&#13;
seemingly "common sense" viewpoint: first, the adaptability of educational&#13;
policies to the requirements of the developing countries has often meant&#13;
in practice an emphasis on provision and supply of technical expertise for&#13;
the requirements of technological development at the exclusion of more&#13;
general knowledge. On general theoretical grounds, the underlying assumption&#13;
that the requirements of developing countries are simply "technical" in&#13;
nature is open to challenge. It relies on a conceptually naive dichotomy&#13;
between skills (know-how) and theoretical or propositional knowledge (know-&#13;
whether).&#13;
8.11      Another line of argument runs as follows:  if indeed education has&#13;
been artificially fragmented to serve societal expediency, perhaps reflecting&#13;
the exercise of power among social groups, what analogies can be drawn for&#13;
a world wide fragmentation of education, on the grounds of expediency, where-&#13;
by some countries specialize in the production and export of people capable&#13;
of conceiving problems in their totality, while others are advised to adapt&#13;
education policies to purely technical requirements? What implications did&#13;
this have in the past or will have in the future brain drain?&#13;
8.12      Finally, there is the more prosaic problem of what the nature of&#13;
this adaptation of Western experience to developing countries' requirements&#13;
should be. Bearing in mind the limitations imposed in the transmission of&#13;
experience, as distinct from skills and know-how, it would be over-optimistic&#13;
to expect that, by acquiring a particular type of know-how, a society would&#13;
achieve the state of development that was associated with it historically.&#13;
The developed cotuntries can only furnish a limited number of examples of&#13;
the way to economic growth. It is up to the developing countries themselves&#13;
to seek out the way most suited to their needs (call it self-reliance, if&#13;
you wish).&#13;
8.13      Liberal education might, however, be charged with another&#13;
responsibility--one less susceptible to task descriptions and the specification&#13;
of performances, but one that permeates and filters through, precisely because&#13;
the concept behind it is liberating rather than restricting. On this view,&#13;
the role of liberal education is to make available a wider range of choices&#13;
for decisionmaking and action. By being less, rather than more selective,&#13;
it both gives the opportunity to individuals to develop according to their&#13;
inclinations and it makes it possible for societies to tap the intellectual&#13;
potential of their members; and by teaching people how to learn, rather than&#13;
what to learn, it gives people the chance to generate their own answers&#13;
rather than accept those enforced upon them by others. In short, liberal&#13;
education generates the heuristics by which problems might be tackled, rather&#13;
than stabilizing the performances locked into the current "solutions."&#13;
Education and Underdevelopment&#13;
8.14      Although it has long been recognized that a low rate of literacy&#13;
is a crucial constraint upon the evolution of a society, it is often less&#13;
clear what the exact relationship between education, beyond the literacy&#13;
level, and economic growth involves. The uncertainty is rooted, not in the&#13;
inadequacy of social scientific methods to locate the relevant areas of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
research, but in the fact that the effects of education become apparent&#13;
within a time span exceeding in duration the life of the generation&#13;
that implemented any specific educational policies. The dynamic evolu-&#13;
tion of interconnected social phenomena prevents us from isolating&#13;
variables for the purpose of establishing unambiguous causal&#13;
relationships.&#13;
8.15      On the question how far is education a prime mover of economic&#13;
growth, the historical evidence is equivocal. In England "the industrial&#13;
revolution was accomplished by hard heads and clever fingers" that had&#13;
no systematic education in science or technology (Halsey, 1961). On the&#13;
other hand, in the case of Denmark and the Soviet Union, it seems that&#13;
education played a crucial role in ecowomic development.  Consequently,&#13;
although it is largely recognized that there is a correlation between high&#13;
rates of growth and high rates of expenditure on education, this is not&#13;
necessarily evidence for a causal relationship (Anderson and Bowman, 1963).&#13;
Nevertheless, the reverse is also asserted: that there is no economic&#13;
growth without an adequate education system. It is a truism to say that&#13;
edlucation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for economic&#13;
development.  The real issue is perhaps a different one:  what curriculum&#13;
policies are likely to have what results? This implies a shift of&#13;
attention from quantity to quality differences between educational systems.&#13;
8.16      Attempts to place economic development against an analysis of&#13;
th.e general cultural milieu have, for particular times and places, been&#13;
discouraging. Examples might be generated of culture-related unantici-&#13;
pgated constraints that have blocked progress. Economic development in&#13;
Russia was strongly resisted by the traditionally educated kulaks. Conserv-&#13;
ative forces so dominated the Oxbridge curriculum that the divorce between&#13;
town and gown, academia and the world-of-work, became itself sacrosanct,&#13;
ideologically not open to reexamination. The correlation between techn-&#13;
nical education expansion and the growth of productivity simply points&#13;
to the link between economic development and a cultural, ideological&#13;
aid social infrastructure. The question is which configurations work,&#13;
aid can they be generated? Although all this evidence permits us to&#13;
establish a historical correlation between "traditionally" educated&#13;
eLites and their resistance to modernization, it is again by no means&#13;
clear what the exact causal relationships are. Were the elites opposed&#13;
to modernization because of the type of education they had, or because&#13;
they believed that whatever kind of social change was advocated threat-&#13;
ened their political and economic supremacy? Let us consider a few&#13;
examples.&#13;
8.17      Ghana:  The Imported Value System.  This is a typical case of&#13;
what happens when, in the absence of cultural reconstruction to match&#13;
technical development, a whole value system is imported. In a study among&#13;
Glanaian students the majority saw themselves occupying positions of&#13;
leadership after graduation (Jahoda, 1955). Some of the students' remarks&#13;
were typical examples of this trend: "I should like to enter politics and&#13;
give the country the benefit of my experience."; "I want to be an&#13;
ambassador of Ghana to a foreign country."&#13;
8.18      University students in developing countries are frequently&#13;
introduced into a style of life which is vastly different to the style of&#13;
life of their family and cultural background. To the question what their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
experiences were on returning back to their families during the vacation,&#13;
about 55% of the Ghanaian students replied that they either had to go&#13;
through a difficult period of adaptation or that they could never get used&#13;
to life at home again. Difficulties of adaptation and rejection of family&#13;
culture rested on a variety of reasons: the students felt that they were&#13;
"different" from relatives and former associates, or the latter made it&#13;
obvious that they considered them different.&#13;
8.19      In another study, Barkan (1975) reports that the University of&#13;
Ghana, Legon, is patterned after the Oxbridge model to an unprecedented&#13;
degree, to the extent that "English academic terms were employed whenever&#13;
remotely appropriate, such as naming the terms of the school year. Status&#13;
ranks between members of -the university community were more rigorously&#13;
maintained, and in general, staff/student relations were of an authoritarian&#13;
nature." Although the university ostensively patterns itself on the ideals&#13;
of democracy and liberalism, it is a highly authoritarian institution that&#13;
keeps a tight control on its "dissident" students. Contrary to patterns&#13;
found in some other countries, Barkan found that African students were less&#13;
likely to be in favor of change. They tended to conform with the establish-&#13;
ed order, provided they had secured a niche for themselves within that&#13;
order. Since university education virtually implies enhaced social status&#13;
and far better incomes than those earned by the rest of the population,&#13;
university students had a large stake in the present system, and quickly&#13;
fell into the habits of mind associated with conservation rather than&#13;
critique.&#13;
8.20      Malaysia:  Universities as Failed Change Agent.  This example&#13;
arises from a study taking a pathological perspective on the failure of&#13;
the Malaysian universities to provide the intellectual climate for&#13;
effective social and economic planning. Lim's (1974) study attributes&#13;
the failure of the academic input to the following categories:&#13;
First, the indiscriminate application of Western&#13;
models of planning. These development plans are mainly&#13;
influenced by the "capital-centered" approach, and&#13;
although these models may be logically consistent, it&#13;
is doubtful whether the assumption on which they rest,&#13;
i.e. shortage of capital, is valid in a country like&#13;
Malaysia.&#13;
Second, the fact that universities have not been able&#13;
to compensate for these models by providing alternative&#13;
ones. This is because university syllabuses reproduce&#13;
courses imported from the West that again are badly&#13;
suited to the needs of Malaysia. "Students can choose&#13;
to take courses such as economic development, planning&#13;
or agricultural marketing without having first&#13;
acquired the basic economic, mathematical and statis-&#13;
tical background."&#13;
Third, the very often meaningless syllabus distinctions&#13;
made as, for example, between "analytical" and "applied"&#13;
subjects. Lim comments aptly that "it is difficult to&#13;
visualize a situation where an applied economist could&#13;
study an economic problem properly without having a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
thorough grounding in economic theory. The same can be&#13;
said about the distinction between 'applied economics'&#13;
and 'rural development': "the latter is part of the&#13;
former, and the study of rural development, unless con-&#13;
ducted within a theoretical framework, becomes no more&#13;
than a descriptive account of the institutions and&#13;
problems of the rural sector." Lim suggests instead an&#13;
interdisciplinary approach that will entail the teaching&#13;
of hybrid subjects such as economic anthropology, which&#13;
have evolved from genuine attempts to look at develop-&#13;
ment problems from a wider perspective.&#13;
Fourth, the absence of university participation in govern-&#13;
ment research programs. It is rather surprising that,&#13;
despite the recognized scarcity of human capital, the&#13;
participation of university staff in government sponsored&#13;
research programs is minimal. For example, out of a staff&#13;
of 81 at the Faculty of Economics and Administration, only&#13;
two were involved in joint research with the Economic&#13;
Planning Unit, the government agency concerned with develop-&#13;
ment planning, and these two were only tutors working for&#13;
their Master of Economics degrees.&#13;
Equally low was the academic participation in consultancy&#13;
services, either in the form of membership in government&#13;
committees concerned with planning, or contracts for&#13;
carrying out feasibility and other studies for the govern-&#13;
ment for a fee. Only five members of staff were involved&#13;
in research of the latter type and three of them became&#13;
involved in the project "only because of the initiative&#13;
of a World Bank transport economist who was amazed at&#13;
the lack of cooperation between the universities and the&#13;
government in research."&#13;
8.21      It must also be stressed that it is not only the government&#13;
that underestimates the role academics can play.  The universities them-&#13;
selves are sometimes reluctant to undertake projects, particularly large&#13;
scale projects. Lim cites the example of the Klang Valley Development&#13;
project. Although the government offered the entire project to the&#13;
University of Malaya, the latter turned down the offer on the grounds&#13;
that it did not possess the managerial and supervisory skills required&#13;
for such a large project. The project, which required expertise extend-&#13;
ing from engineering to social sciences and law, was finally awarded&#13;
to a foreign consortium, and out of a staff of over 520 at the univer-&#13;
sity only three engineers were invited to take part.&#13;
Some Generalizations&#13;
8.22      From the examples cited, and from general indications in the&#13;
literature, it is now possible to give a tentative interpretation of&#13;
some of the problems already encountered in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
8.23      There is a tendency for higher educational institutions in&#13;
developing countries to adopt some of the surface features of their&#13;
Western counterparts. Dysfunctional features inherited include the&#13;
cumbersome administrative paraphernalia, the social divisions, and&#13;
the definitions by which different segments of knowledge attract&#13;
differential prestige (that which Michael Young, 1971, in his&#13;
examination of UK school programs called "high status and low status&#13;
knowledge").&#13;
8.24      There exists lack of liaison between the courses offered&#13;
in the industrial/technical institutes and the local economy. In one&#13;
case in Southern Italy, 37% of the total number of students completing&#13;
such courses went on to university because of lack of professional&#13;
outlets (see Moscati in Kloskowska and Martinotti, 1977).&#13;
8.25      Under these conditions, higher education may actually rein-&#13;
force the problems it is intending to eliminate. Universities can&#13;
become the means of socially reproducing the status quo. This is the&#13;
opposite of the aspirations of liberal education to generate a widely&#13;
based cultural critique as well as generalized educational competences.&#13;
8.26      There is a crisis in leadership education.  Leadership appears&#13;
to require the kind of holistic perspective that one might with most&#13;
optimism associate with the cast of mind of liberal education. This&#13;
holistic perspective can be transmitted by the universities through&#13;
carefully designed courses that will familiarize students with their&#13;
country's culture, the people's actual needs, and the major theoretical&#13;
contributions in the area of politics, the economy and society.&#13;
8.27      It is now possible to revisit the concept of liberal education&#13;
and indicate the scope and direction of any investment that can be held&#13;
responsibly to offer hopes of inioads into the intractible problems&#13;
outlined above. Such a liberal education program at a university in a&#13;
developing country would have most chance of success in relation to&#13;
generating conditions of cultural, social, economic and technological&#13;
development if it were characterized as follows:&#13;
The intellectual basis of the program should be balanced&#13;
between the provision of culture-related core programs&#13;
task orientated workshops, and induction into the&#13;
intellectual inquiries that allow both reliable knowledge&#13;
and autonomy in decisionmaking.&#13;
The context of liberal education in a total curriculum&#13;
map should be kept constantly in mind, so that the impli-&#13;
cations for other sectors are clearly understood. For&#13;
example, it would be foolish not to accept the priority,&#13;
in some instances, of rural development programs. Liberal&#13;
education courses, when society-related would, for example,&#13;
familiarize students with knowledge of broader practicalities,&#13;
like the state of the economy or agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
8.28      What liberal education does is to make people aware of the&#13;
variety of choices for human behavior. It provides intellectual&#13;
competence and awareness of problems and solutions. It does not only&#13;
teach people how to do things, but also how to think about them. Wide&#13;
experience and familiarity with a variety of courses give people&#13;
greater freedom. It is in this sense that the word "liberal" can be&#13;
given any meaning at all: the broadly educated person is freer than&#13;
the person who has had a narrow training.&#13;
8.29      Finally, the study of the modern intellectual tradition in&#13;
developing countries can provide a way of perceiving problems in a&#13;
world wide perspective. Since achieving independence many developing&#13;
countries have produced their own indigenous scholars, poets,&#13;
playwrights and litterateurs who are in a better position than outsiders&#13;
to understand and articulate social needs and problems; whereas on the&#13;
one hand they express the unique experiences and predicament of their&#13;
own countries, on the other they form links between their own societies&#13;
and the rest of the world.&#13;

SECTION IX&#13;
CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
9.1       In this paper we have gone through two kinds of evidence in&#13;
examining the economic foundations of investment in higher education.&#13;
The first kind of evidence was quantitative, referring to costs, monetary&#13;
benefits, employment, income distribution and social demand. The second&#13;
kind was mostly qualitative, such as the case for a non-vocational&#13;
curriculum. The conclusion we reached seems to be advancing the rather&#13;
counterintuitive notion that a considerable element of software, general&#13;
faculties might be needed along with narrower vocational courses in&#13;
developing countries. This notion sounds odd because the very idea that&#13;
human resources can be thought of as a developmental factor virtually&#13;
started with the launching of the Soviet Sputnik in the mid-1950s. This&#13;
was a technical achievement and encouraged the idea that the promotion of&#13;
science could lead to innovations, not only in space, but in industry&#13;
as well, thus accelerating economic growth. The catalyst towards these&#13;
innovations was, of course, engineers and technicians rather than&#13;
lawyers or secondary school graduates of the general curriculum type.&#13;
A number of international conferences held at the time had a dramatic&#13;
effect on emphasizing the need for scientific and technical personnel&#13;
for economic growth and development. 1/&#13;
9.2       As this happened over two decades ago, one may ask what is the&#13;
current state of thought in the literature regarding the economic value&#13;
of technical or vocational education? There certainly exists skepticism&#13;
on this issue. The initial enthusiasm for technical education was dampened&#13;
by the documentation of the fact that a high correlation between technical&#13;
education and economic development does not necessarily mean that the former&#13;
was a cause of the latter. In fact the direction of causation might have&#13;
been the other way around, namely from economic development toward increased&#13;
enrollments in vocational schools. The case here is similar to that of&#13;
minimum schooling laws that have been historically found to follow the&#13;
pressure for increased enrollments in schools (Landes and Solmon, 1972).&#13;
9.3       Even if a causal link were established between vocational training&#13;
and economic development, it does not follow that this training would have&#13;
to take place in formal schools (Stoikov, 1975). In fact, vocational&#13;
education originated outside the formal school system and a great part of&#13;
it takes place today in the form of apprenticeship on the shop floor. As&#13;
the state of technology becomes more and more sophisticated, formal schools&#13;
are unable either to keep up with or provide the necessary training. The&#13;
firms involved, however, keep instilling specific skills in their employees&#13;
following the latest technological developments.&#13;
9.4       Another factor is the ease with which differently trained man-&#13;
power can be substituted for each other. It has now been well documented&#13;
that the degree of substitution in production between different kinds of&#13;
skills is on the high side, hence weakening the view that fixed skill&#13;
proportions are needed for the efficient operation of the economy (Dougherty,&#13;
1972). The evidence on high substitution elasticities tends to invalidate&#13;
the case for the necessity of a given amount of technicians for economic&#13;
growth. When this is combined with the relative expensiveness of technical&#13;
education, one might wish to tap the potential of general faculties as well.&#13;
1   E.g. the OECD 1959 Hague Conference on Techniques for Forecasting Future&#13;
Requirements of Scientific and Technical Personnel (see OECD 1960).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
9.5       We might conclude that in this paper we have rediscovered Foster's&#13;
(1965) "vocational school fallacy," although at a higher level. What Foster&#13;
argued was against the provision of vocational training within formal educa-&#13;
tional institutions for the purpose of promoting economic development. In&#13;
fact, general education should be thought of as a prerequisite for technical&#13;
education and the latter should be provided more efficiently on the job&#13;
rather than inside the school. Fifteen years later the case for this view&#13;
Is no less compelling.&#13;
9.6       This conclusion, however, must be qualified by the analytical&#13;
caveats discussed in the course of presenting the evidence. To recapitulate,&#13;
it is the benefits side that is more elusive relative to the cost side and&#13;
future research effort should concentrate on increasing evidence on the&#13;
former. What seems to be urgently needed is an annual monitoring service of&#13;
the labor market performance of the recent output of particular school types.&#13;
It is only on the basis of this information that the policymaker could&#13;
provide for a truly balanced educational system.&#13;

            Higher education in developing countries :
            a cost-benefit analysis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this paper is to take a
            close look at the socio-economic rationale of higher
            education provision in developing countries. This is done by
            reviewing the costs and benefits associated with investment
            in higher education as a whole and especially in different
            post-secondary subjects. University costs, and in particular
            benefits, are treated here in their broadest sense to arrive
            at the true contribution of higher education to the standard
            of living of the present and future generations. This
            socio-economic evaluation of the higher education subsector
            is performed by reference to a multi-country, multi-period
            data set, which has been augmented by nonquantitative considerations.
