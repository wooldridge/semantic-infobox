POPULATION AND POVERTY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD&#13;
A Background Paper for World Development Report, 1980&#13;
This paper analyzes the association between poverty and rapid population&#13;
growth. In addition to reviewing the current demographic situation and the&#13;
future outlook for population growth, it considers the following questions':&#13;
W4hat are the effects of rapid population growth on economic growth&#13;
and income distribution?&#13;
How does family size affect the health, educational status, and&#13;
income of individual family members?&#13;
To what extent, and how, do low income, poor health, and a lack&#13;
of education cause high fertility?&#13;
Is the provision of family planning services an end in itself,&#13;
as well as a means of fertility reduction?&#13;
How effective and economical are improvements in health and&#13;
education as a way of weakening the vicious link between poverty&#13;
and high fertility?&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The populations of developing countries are growing rapidly; the&#13;
role of human resource programs in alleviating poverty and more generally&#13;
in contributing to development cannot be considered outside this context of&#13;
rapid population growth.&#13;
Developing countries are like long-distance runners. In their&#13;
race against time to eliminate poverty, rapid population growth is an&#13;
additional burden, which regardless of their inherent strengths, slows them&#13;
down. Moreover a quick glance at the race suggests it is an unfair one.&#13;
The weaker runners are those advancing most slowly and already behind the&#13;
pack; they also have the highest population growth rates, and are thus the&#13;
most severely handicapped.&#13;
In the following pages, we look more closely at this apparent&#13;
close association between poverty and rapid population growth, and consider&#13;
why and how the two are mutually reinforcing. By poverty we mean not only&#13;
low income, but the nexus of conditions often but imperfectly associated&#13;
with low income--lack of education, poor nutrition and high morbidity and&#13;
mortality. A major point, in fact, is that improvements in health and&#13;
education, in addition to their direct benefits, are an effective and&#13;
relatively low-cost way to weaken the link binding low-income households and&#13;
poor countries to rapid rates of population growth.&#13;
At the outset it is worth emphasizing that, though poverty and&#13;
rapid population growth are strongly, indeed as we hope to show, causally&#13;
linked, neither is the sole determinant nor the inevitable consequence&#13;
of the other. In particular, if we ignore the extent of poverty within&#13;
nations, counterexamples abound. Rapid population growth has accompanied&#13;
rapid economic growth in Brazil; slower population growth has accompanied&#13;
slower economic growth in India and Sri Lanka. Elimination of poverty in a&#13;
"reasonable" time period may be possible for a few countries despite their&#13;
population burden--e.g., those with unusual natural resources such as the&#13;
oil-exporting countries, or those already running fast and light due to&#13;
prior development policies or a head start in the growth race. On the&#13;
other hand, for the weaker runners, reducing the population burden is&#13;
no panacea; more direct attacks on poverty and the problem of slow growth&#13;
are necessary. There is no runner, however, for whom a lighter burden&#13;
would not speed the pace; within every country, for any given resources,&#13;
the depth and incidence of future poverty could be reduced with lower&#13;
rates of popu~lation growth.&#13;
We begin (Part I) with a brief review of the current demographic&#13;
situation in the developing world. Particular attention goes to the shift&#13;
over time in the association across countries between low income and high&#13;
fertility and mortality rates.&#13;
Part II is concerned with the effects of rapid population growth&#13;
on the situation of the poor. These effects operate at the national level&#13;
by influencing factor and product prices and the per capita availability of&#13;
investment resources; as the poor are usually the last in line for jobs,&#13;
school places and public health services, rapid population growth hurts them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
disproportionately. They also operate at the family level, by reducing&#13;
parents' per-child investments in health and education; since the poor tend&#13;
to have large families, poor children are often particularly disadvantaged.&#13;
The negative association between income and fertility is clear,&#13;
across countries and across households within countries. Association&#13;
alone gives few clues to causation, however; in Part III we review the&#13;
theory at the family level regarding the relation between family size and&#13;
family members' health and educational as well as income status, seeking to&#13;
answer whether and to what extent low income, lack of education and poor&#13;
health cause high fertility, the major contributor to rapid population&#13;
growth.&#13;
Part IV discusses population policy, with particular attention&#13;
to an important component of policy, the delivery of family planning servi-&#13;
ces to the poor. Reducing population growth is not an end in itself but a&#13;
means to the larger end of improving human welfare. Provision of family&#13;
planning services, however, serves both as a means of fertility reduction,&#13;
and as an end.&#13;
Illustrative projections of population growth into the 21st&#13;
century follow (Part V), based on a set of assumptions regarding the future&#13;
course of growth and poverty alleviation and the future family planning&#13;
policies of developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. The Demographic Situation in the Developing World&#13;
A review of the current world demographic situation yields five&#13;
central facts regarding the developing countries, each of which bears on&#13;
our overall theme of the links between poverty and raid population growth:&#13;
1.        Postwar population growth rates in developing countries have&#13;
been unprecedentedly rapid.&#13;
Most of the increase in world population today is occurring in&#13;
developing countries, now comprising about three quarters of the world popu-&#13;
lation. In the now-developed world (Europe, the U.S. and Canada, the Soviet&#13;
Union, Japan, Oceania), population growth has slowed to a rate below 1 per-&#13;
cent a year. Figure I-1 shows trends in births and death rates for developed&#13;
and developing countries. In the developed world death rates have fallen&#13;
gradually and steadily since the early 19th century, and birth rates have come&#13;
down more or less in tandem, slowing population growth before it could become&#13;
seriously burdensome. Natural rates of population increase -- the gap between&#13;
birth and death rates -- have rarely exceeded 1.5 percent. In contrast, in&#13;
the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, the demographic&#13;
transition -- the change from high birth and death rates to low ones -- has&#13;
come in fits and starts. Both birth and death rates remained high until well&#13;
into the 20th century. After World War II, death rates fell steeply; as birth&#13;
rates fell by less, population growth accelerated. By the mid-1960s, the&#13;
combination of still-high fertility and much-reduced mortality led to popu-&#13;
lation growth rates well above 2 percent a year. In several countries of&#13;
Latin America and Africa, rates of natural increase exceeded 3 percent; a&#13;
3 percent rate implies a doubling of population every 23 years, compared&#13;
to 70 years doubling time with the 1 percent growth typical in 19th century&#13;
Europe. Though birth rates are now declining, they are still high relative&#13;
to death rates, and population growth poses for the now-modernizing economies&#13;
a problem for which the economic and demographic history of the West offers&#13;
no real precedent.&#13;
2.        In the last decade or so, rates of population growth in the&#13;
developing countries have been declining, even if very slowly.&#13;
For developing countries as a group, the high point of population&#13;
growth, when high fertility combined with declining mortality, was passed&#13;
in about 1965. Since then, in many countries -- indeed in those comprising&#13;
the bulk of the world's population -- a fertility decline began between 1965&#13;
and the present. Moreover, the rate at which fertility is declining appears&#13;
to be accelerating; the recent declines in developing countries have been&#13;
faster than earlier declines in Europe and Japan. Mortality declines which&#13;
began earlier, in virtually all countries in the 1950s, have continued, but&#13;
in the last few years the pace of mortality decline appears to have slowed.&#13;
With this emerging combination of accelerating fertility decline and deceler-&#13;
ating mortality decline, natural rates of increase have gone from a high of&#13;
about 2.4 percent in 1965 to 2.2 percent today.&#13;

Figure I-2 shows crude birth and death rates for the period&#13;
1950 to 1980 by region, and Table I-i shows the change in those rates and&#13;
in the rates of natural increase by region between 1950 and 1980. For&#13;
developing countries, the period 1950 to 1965 was marked by an increasing&#13;
rate of natural increase (from 2.0 to 2.4 annually), largely because of&#13;
falling death rates. Since 1965, the natural increase rate has declined, to&#13;
2.2, due to falling birth rates. In this latter period in East Asia and&#13;
Latin America, birth rates have fallen more rapidly than death rates and&#13;
natural rates of increase have declined. In South Asia, the decline in the&#13;
birth rates has been almost sufficient to offset the continued death rate&#13;
decline. Only in Africa have birth rates not changed at all, so that&#13;
population growth rates have increased as death rates have continued to&#13;
fall.&#13;
Table I-2 shows levels and trends of life expectancy at birth by&#13;
region. In developed countries, increases in life expectancy have slowed as&#13;
an upper limit of about 70 has been reached. But up to life expectancy levels&#13;
of about 60, the annual amount of increase in now-developed countries was&#13;
always increasing (not shown). In contrast the amount of annual increase in&#13;
developing countries is declining at life expectancy levels that are still&#13;
relatively low, e.g. 47 for Africa in 1980, and 58 for Asia. 1/&#13;
In contrast to mortality, where the assumption of continued rapid&#13;
declines is now in question, expected overall fertility declines do seem&#13;
to be taking place, and in a few countries, declines exceed what was pro-&#13;
jected 10 years ago. Though there is still dispute about the magnitude of&#13;
the decline in certain countries, and about exactly how widespread it has&#13;
been, the fact of some decline has been widely acknowledged and the expec-&#13;
tation of a continued decline strengthened during the 1970s. 2/&#13;
Recent trends in crude birth rates for the 13 developing coun-&#13;
tries with the largest populations in 1980 are shown in Table I-3. Among&#13;
1/   In some countries within regions, e.g. Costa Rica, Thailand, and&#13;
possibly Kenya, the rate of decline has slowed little or not at all.&#13;
Given problems with mortality data and wide variation even within&#13;
countries, a definite conclusion about the overall mortality trend is&#13;
not warranted; what can be said is that we can no longer assume that&#13;
mortality rates will continue to fall automatically in the developing&#13;
world. For a careful summary of the existing evidence on mortality&#13;
trends in developing countries, raising the question whether the era&#13;
of rapid mortality decline is ending, see Gwatkin, 1980.&#13;
2/   The controversy Qver whether declines exceed earlier predictions (Bogue&#13;
and Tsui, 1979; lemeny, 1979) should not obscure the fact that some&#13;
decline has probably occurred in most countries of Asia and Latin America,&#13;
and that the decline since 1965 has been considerable in Chile, Colombia,&#13;
Costa Rica, Cuba, Sri Lanka, Taiwan as well as in the larger countries of&#13;

Crude Birth Rate figures as reported by Mauldin are in his&#13;
article, "Patterns of Fertility Decline in Developing&#13;
Countries, 1950-1975." He used a variety of sources,&#13;
including country vital registration data, where such data&#13;
are good; World Fertility Survey:--data-; and some so-called&#13;
best estimates, e.g. forC-hina.&#13;

the larger countries, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand,&#13;
Turkey, Egypt, and South Korea have all had declines of at least 10 percent.&#13;
In countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Cuba and Chile the decline began&#13;
in the early 1960s and has been sustained; a similar and now marked de-&#13;
cline began later in Thailand, Colombia, and Malaysia. In Brazil, Mexico,&#13;
India and Indonesia decline has been less marked; in Bangladesh, Pakistan&#13;
and most African countries there has been little if any decline.&#13;
Moreover, for most countries, these crude birth rate changes&#13;
iainimize the real changes in fertility rates. Because of high fertility and&#13;
declining mortality in the 1950s in developing countries, a large proportion&#13;
of today's population in those countries is of childbearing age. Until this&#13;
group has completed its reproductive years, overall birth rates (the birth&#13;
rate being the number of births in a year per thousand persons in the total&#13;
population) will be relatively high, even if actual average family size is&#13;
small. 1/&#13;
3.        In general, current fertility and mortality rates are negatively&#13;
related to income.&#13;
The negative relationship between country per-capita income and&#13;
fertility and mortality levels is depicted in Figures I-3 and I-4. The&#13;
curved lines show the statistically-estimated expected relationship between&#13;
fertility and mortality and country per-capita income -- "expected" on the&#13;
basis of the current estimated rates and incomes (1977) of 88 countries.&#13;
Only a few of the 88 countries are named in the figures. Those named fell&#13;
furthest from the line; their actual fertility or mortality was more than&#13;
one standard deviation from what we would expect on the basis of their per-&#13;
capita income. In general, the higher a country s per-capita income, the&#13;
lower its fertility and mortality. Among developing countries, those of&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan)&#13;
have the highest levels of fertility and mortality and the lowest incomes;&#13;
the developed countries have the lowest levels of fertility and mortality&#13;
and the highest incomes. In the regressions on which these figures are based,&#13;
1/   The crude birth rate exaggerates fertility when large cohorts are of&#13;
reproductive age and their fertility is low relative to that of earlier&#13;
smaller cohorts. E.g. in Colombia the crude birth rate fell by 35&#13;
percent between 1960/65 and 1975; the total fertility rate fell by 44&#13;
percent. The total fertility rate is the number of children a women&#13;
would bear in her lifetime if she experienced throughout her childbear-&#13;
ing years the age-specific fertility rates of women aged 15 to 49 in&#13;
the year for which the rate is defined. In contrast to the crude birth&#13;
rate, the total fertility rate is not affected if a large proportion of&#13;
a population is in the childbearing years due to past high rates of&#13;
fertility; it is for that reason the best single indicator of current&#13;
fertility behavior. Berelson et. al. (1979) notes that in the next few&#13;
years, insofar as the decline continues, the birth rate will continue to&#13;
be pushing against an age structure that will have a higher percentage&#13;
of women in the reproductive ages; it might otherwise be lower by 2 to&#13;
4 points.&#13;

per-capita income accounted for more than 50 percent of the variance among&#13;
countries of the world in both fertility and mortality rates. 1/&#13;
Within-country data relating household income to household fertil-&#13;
ity are rare. Tables I-4 and I-5 summarize rates for households grouped by&#13;
income class in Brazil and Colombia, where the negative association clearly&#13;
holds. 2/&#13;
4.        But the negative association is far from perfect, at least at the&#13;
country level. Of the countries named, those with relatively low fertility&#13;
given their income, include Korea, Indonesia, Colombia and Sri Lanka; Mexico&#13;
and the high-income oil-exporting countries of Iran, Libya, and Venezuela,&#13;
have relatively high fertility. 3/ The exceptions call attention to certain&#13;
factors which mediate the simple negative association we have described.&#13;
These are the distribution of income within a country; the availability and&#13;
distribution of health and educational services, a factor often but not nec-&#13;
essarily associated with the distribution of income; and with regard to fer-&#13;
tility, the access of the poor to family planning services. Great inequality&#13;
in the distribution of income is one possible explanation for high fertility&#13;
rates in certain countries of Latin America -- including Mexico and Brazil --&#13;
despite average per-capita incomes above those of Asia. Access of the poor to&#13;
health and education may explain the low mortality and fertility of Sri Lanka.&#13;
Availability of family planning appears to have contributed to relatively low&#13;
fertility in Thailand, Colombia and most recently Indonesia. The reason these&#13;
matter and the way they interact are the subject of Parts III and IV.&#13;
1/   For the regression results, see Appendix B.&#13;
2/   In the case of Colombia, underreporting in the no information and&#13;
no income households is possible, and would explain their slightly&#13;
lower rates. These simple correlations do not imply causation; across&#13;
households, low income is usually associated with other factors,&#13;
especially education, which in multivariate analyses, have a more&#13;
consistent negative relation to mortality and fertility, and often&#13;
eliminate the apparent income link altogether. But that is the subject&#13;
.of Part III.&#13;
1/   The oil-exporting countries were excluded from the Figure I-3 regression&#13;
and thus are not shown.&#13;

5.        Finally, the relationship between income level and mortality&#13;
and fertility rates has shifted over time.&#13;
It is well known that mortality in developing countries has fallen&#13;
more rapidly and at income and education levels lower than those associated&#13;
with mortality decline in the West. 1/ Less well-known is that the same holds&#13;
for fertility; recent fertility declines, where they have begun, are occurring&#13;
at lower average levels of income and at a faster rate than earlier declines.&#13;
The remainder of this section is a discussion of this shift over&#13;
time in the association between country income levels and mortality and fer-&#13;
tility declines. The purpose is to draw out the nature of the interaction&#13;
between the prevalence of poverty within countries and these rates.&#13;
Past and Future Mortality Decline&#13;
Analysis of the mortality decline using country-level data suggests&#13;
that until recently a good deal of the postwar decline has been due less&#13;
to improvements in living standards than to the introduction of important&#13;
new public health technologies; in this sense, technology has probably&#13;
led "development," where by development is meant reduction in the incidence&#13;
of poverty. For mortality, the major question for the future is the extent&#13;
to which future declines depend on further development, i.e., further&#13;
improvements in nutrition and health for broader segments of the populations.&#13;
Mortality (and more generally health) is the result of the inter-&#13;
action of three sets of factors affecting an individual's physical well-&#13;
being: public health services which affect mortality regardless of indivi-&#13;
dual behavior, such as malarial spraying and immunization; health and&#13;
environmental services which reduce the costs of health to individuals but&#13;
require some individual response, e.g. clean water; and, lastly, an array of&#13;
individual characteristics, including both income, which affects health&#13;
through food consumption and housing, and education, which affects the speed&#13;
and efficiency with which individuals respond to health and environmental&#13;
services. Mortality in Europe began its decline in response to the second&#13;
and third set; with higher incomes and increasing literacy rates came improved&#13;
nutrition and sanitary conditions. 2/ The first set has been an additional&#13;
1/   E.g., the crude death rate in the Indian subcontinent fell from about&#13;
25 to about 15 between 1950 and 1970. Per capita income in those&#13;
countries was still below $200 in 1970 and the literacy rate below 40&#13;
percent. Death rates in Europe at the turn of the century were still&#13;
above 20 per thousand.&#13;
2/   Regarding the early declines in the West, Cochrane et. al., 1980, cite&#13;
McKeown and Brown (1955) on the 19th century British experience. See&#13;
also McDermott, 1966 (cited by Gwatkin, 1980) on declines in infant mor-&#13;
tality in the early 20th century in New York City, which are attributed&#13;
primarily to social, economic, nutritional and environmental improve-&#13;
maents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17 -&#13;
factor in the more recent mortality declines in developing countries, though&#13;
increases in average income and improvements in health services have also&#13;
played a role. Increases in income and education are estimated to have&#13;
explained about 50 percent of the drop in mortality in Latin America between&#13;
1955 and 1973. 1/ Immunization programs and pest control, which rely less&#13;
on changes in living conditions, presumably explained some of ilie rest.    On&#13;
a world-wide basis income gains alone (excluding education gains) explain&#13;
about 20 percent of the 1930-1960 decrease in mortality. 2/ It is estimated&#13;
that life expectancy in developing countries in 1970 would have been 8 years&#13;
below what it was without the contribution of changes in public health tech-&#13;
nologies. 3/&#13;
But there are several reasons for believing that of the three sets&#13;
of factors affecting mortality named above, the benefits of the first have to&#13;
a large extent been fully reaped, and that further mortality declines depend&#13;
on changes in individual behavior, changes facilitated by increasing income&#13;
and education and improved access to basic health services. First is a&#13;
difference between developing countries, and now-developed countries at a&#13;
similar stage in mortality decline, in the diseases which kill. For example,&#13;
mortality from diarrhea in the developing world is two to three times as high&#13;
as it was in the West when overall mortality levels were similar. 4/ Liarrhea&#13;
is a disease of the poor--in fact primarily of poor children; it is found&#13;
along with malnutrition, and in some sense caused by lack of access to clean&#13;
water, to simple health services and to the basic education which might com-&#13;
pensate for difficult living conditions.&#13;
1/   Palloni, 1979, Table 10 and p. 28.    He calculates the change due&#13;
to socioeconomic variables by using coefficients from cross-country&#13;
estimations at two points in time, 1955 and 1973, taking the average&#13;
of the differences in the death rate produced by using the values&#13;
of the variables in 1955 and 1973 first in the relation for 1955 and&#13;
then in the relation for 1973.&#13;
2/   Preston, 1976.   Preston used for that estimate a technique similar to&#13;
that described in fn. 1.&#13;
3/   Preston, 1976, p. 20.&#13;
4/   Gwatkin, 1979, cites Preston and Nelson, 1974, p. 40.     Palloni (1979,&#13;
p. 21) reports relative stability in the causes of death in Latin&#13;
America before and after 1964, thus no reduction over time in deaths&#13;
from diarrheal and infectious diseases. But the cut-off date may not&#13;
have been the appropriate one, and the variation in the pattern and&#13;
timing of decline among countries may be so great as to obscure any&#13;
relation for the group as a whole for a particular period.&#13;

Second, within developing countries, differentials in mortality&#13;
which depend on income and other indicators of socioeconomic status are&#13;
evidence for a link between poverty and high mortality. In Latin America,&#13;
infant and child mortality rates are as much as five times greater among&#13;
children whose mothers have no schooling, compared to children with 10 or&#13;
more years of schooling. 1/ Child mortality rates, as shown in Tables I-4&#13;
and I-5 above, also decline as household income rises and, controlling for&#13;
parents' education, are generally higher in rural than in urban areas.&#13;
Finally, in those countries where life expectancy is higher than&#13;
an income measure alone would preduct -- Sri Lanka, Cuba, Costa Rica and&#13;
Korea -- income tends to be better distributed than in other developing&#13;
countries, illiteracy is low and health services are more widespread. The&#13;
barrier that poverty, in its various guises, poses to mortality decline, is&#13;
less a factor in these countries.&#13;
Past and Future Fertility Iecline&#13;
A fertility decline relies almost entirely on a change in the&#13;
behavior of individuals, and in contrast to mortality, fertility decline&#13;
has thus always been assumed to be closely associated with "development."&#13;
But here what is actually meant by development is important. It was once&#13;
assumed that structural changes associated with development -- urbanization,&#13;
industrialization, the shift from family to factory production, and the&#13;
attainment of income levels close to those of the West -- were a prerequisite&#13;
to fertility decline; declines in the 1960s that were largely confined to the&#13;
industrializing economies of Taiwan, Korea (Republic of), Singapore and Hong&#13;
Kong seemed to confirm this view. But fertility declines beginning in other&#13;
developing countries in the late 1960s and spreading to more in the 1970s&#13;
have moved ahead of "development," where development is considered primarily&#13;
in terms of macrostructural change. 2/ Two noncompeting explanations for&#13;
the shift in the relationship seem important.&#13;
First, and important from the point of view of policy, is that&#13;
fertility declines are related to a different definition of "development,"&#13;
one defined in terms of the standard of living -- levels of literacy, life&#13;
expectancy and the average incomes of the poorest half of the population --&#13;
rather than with the macro changes conventionally associated with develop-&#13;
ment, such as higher average incomes and a shift to an industrial society.&#13;
For a large group of developing countries, the simple correlation between&#13;
the 1965-75 fertility decline and per-capita income in 1970 was only .13;&#13;
1/   Behm and Rueda, 1977.   Evidence from other regions as well is summarized&#13;
by Cochrane, et. al. (1980). For evidence that education of the mother&#13;
generally reduces child mortality, controlling for other variables such&#13;
as income and residence, see O'Hara (1979).&#13;
2/   The most-cited examples are China and Indonesia.    See, for example,&#13;
Freedman, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
but between the decline and adult literacy it was .70, and between the decline&#13;
and life expectancy it was .76. 1/ lespite high average incomes, rapid indus-&#13;
trialization and rapid growth, fertility declined less in Brazil and Venezuela&#13;
between 1965 and 1975 than in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey; in the latter&#13;
countries, income gains and social services have been more widely distributed.&#13;
The behavioral mechanisms behind these exceptions are the subject of Part III.&#13;
Second, and also critical for policy, is that the technology of&#13;
family limitation has greatly improved. As discussed in Part IV, modern con-&#13;
traceptives have lowered the psychic costs of limiting fertility, and many&#13;
governments have taken steps to subsidize the money costs of using modern&#13;
contraceptives by establishing or supporting programs to deliver family&#13;
planning services. Where family planning services are widespread and low in&#13;
cost, fertility has declined more rapidly than social and econormic progress&#13;
alone would predict -- e.g., in countries such as Tunisia, Thailand, Colombia,&#13;
Costa Rica and most recently Indonesia. 2/&#13;
Future declines in fertility thus seem to depend both on general&#13;
improvements in living standards and on diffusion to broader segments&#13;
of the population of the technology of modern contraception. 3/ In contrast&#13;
to mortality, the technology available to reduce fertility, has not been as&#13;
universally available. The deceleration in the mortality decline and the&#13;
acceleration in the fertility decline are both consistent with a difference&#13;
in the timing of the application of technology. Of course, there are also&#13;
differences in the way the technology interacts with individual behavior to&#13;
bring about a change; in particular, the use of means to restrict fertility&#13;
requires a conscious choice on the part of individuals, and this alone could&#13;
explain the delay in the worldwide use of contraceptives compared to the&#13;
widespread use of medical technologies not dependent on individual applica-&#13;
tion.&#13;
Not only is fertility, at least in a few countries, declining&#13;
at lower levels of industrialization and urbanization than in the West, it&#13;
is also declining more rapidly. Countries in which fertility began a&#13;
decline at the end of the 19th century (including England, Austria, Italy,&#13;
Netherlands and the United States) took about 50 years to go from crude&#13;
birth rates of 35 to 20 per thousand, averaging a decline of about .3 per&#13;
1/   Mauldin and Berelson, 1978, p. 104.&#13;
2/   Ibid.,  Table 12, p. 110.&#13;
3/   In terms of policy, there is now generally a consensus that fertility&#13;
declines depend both on lowering the demand for children, via in-&#13;
creasing education and life expectancy, and on improving the supply&#13;
of the means to limit fertility. The continuing question of the&#13;
relative importance of the two in particular settings, and the relative&#13;
cost-effectiveness of interventions focusing on one or the other, is&#13;
discussed in Part IV.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

year. Countries such as Chile and Taiwan which in 1965 had crude birth&#13;
rates of about 35 per thousand have averaged as much as one point a year off&#13;
their crude birth rates since then. Other countries, including Colombia,&#13;
Costa Rica and Malaysia, which in 1965 had rates above 40 per thousand, have&#13;
experienced declines of about one point a year below the 35 per thousand&#13;
level. Unfortunately, we know surprisingly little about the extent to which&#13;
more rapid declines in fertility can be attributed to the increasing pace at&#13;
which other changes are also occurring, e.g. in education, in income growth,&#13;
in urbanization and until recently, in mortality. Most studies compare&#13;
levels of fertility across countries, regions or households, to levels of&#13;
various indicators; a few relate changes in fertility to levels of indicators.&#13;
Lack of data has until recently made it difficult to relate changes in&#13;
fertility to changes in indicators. 1/ The acceleration is not really&#13;
surprising, however; in addition to whatever impact changes in the convention-&#13;
al indicators may have had, modern means of communication have vastly&#13;
increased the speed with which ideas, including the idea of family limita-&#13;
tion, are transferred across physical and cultural barriers; and modern&#13;
contraceptives have lowered the costs of family limitation to individuals.&#13;
1/   Wheeler, 1980, p. 49 reports results of a regression of changes in&#13;
birth rates for 66 developing countries on changes in per capita income&#13;
and in the death rate (as well as on the level of a country's family&#13;
planning effort -- discussed below). Both of the "change" variables&#13;
were statistically significant. Mauldin and Berelson (1978, p. 107)&#13;
report having done such a "change" analysis for 1965-1975 for 35&#13;
countries for which they could obtain data. They do not show their&#13;
results, and note that there may be a sample selection problem in using&#13;
only countries in which data were available for all their variables.&#13;
When they dropped certain variables in order to include more countries,&#13;
the proportion of variance explained fell considerably.&#13;

II.  Effects of Rapid Population Growth on PovertX&#13;
Economy-Wide Effects&#13;
The 18th and 19th century economic growth of Westerr. Europe&#13;
and North America was accompanied by the first sustained increase of&#13;
population the world had ever known. 1/ A growing population is not ipso&#13;
facto bad for growth; it can contribute to growth by stimulating demand,&#13;
encouraging technological innovation and reducing investment risks; by&#13;
allowing for constant improvement of the labor force with increasingly-&#13;
educated workers; and by permitting economies of scale in transportation&#13;
and communications development, and in production for large markets. 2/&#13;
But postwar population growth in the developing world has been&#13;
far more rapid than it was in industrializing Euope; rates have averaged&#13;
between 2 and 3 percent in most developing countries, compared to at most 1&#13;
percent in 18th and 19th century Europe. These figures have meant a doub-&#13;
ling of the population every 20 to 35 years, and a concentration of the&#13;
population of developing countries in the young, nonproductive ages, a&#13;
situation which is less favorable to production and proportionately more&#13;
burdensome with respect to consumption and social overhead investments.&#13;
Moreover, except for a few developing countries, outmigration has not&#13;
afforded the same easing of population growth pressures as it did in 19th&#13;
century Europe, when substantial numbers left for the New World.3/ Finally,&#13;
the additional burden represented by this more rapid growth is compounded&#13;
for developing countries because they must achieve economic growth in the&#13;
face of the competitive products of already-modernized economies; and&#13;
because social mores plus the need to compete in a world of rapidly changing&#13;
technology require greater investments in the health and education of each&#13;
new generation.&#13;
1/   Indeed, this is how Kuznets defined modern economic growth (1966,&#13;
p. 200).&#13;
2/   For this view, see Boserup, 1965; Hirshman, 1958; Glover and Simon,&#13;
1975; among others.&#13;
3/   For example, between 1880 and 1890, almost 10 percent of the total&#13;
population of the Scandinavian countries emigrated. About 6 percent&#13;
of Italy's population went to the U.S. alone between 1905 and 1914.&#13;
See Kuznets, 1966, pp. 51-55. (Of course, population was growing very&#13;
rapidly in the United States, as rapidly as in the developing countries&#13;
today; but when immigration is a major cause of growth, average age and&#13;
productivity of the population tends to be higher.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
The population problem for most developing countries is largely&#13;
one of rapid growth rates, rather than of density. 1/ Rapid growth rates&#13;
are problematic in two respects: they may slow economic growth; and given&#13;
certain conditions, they may exacerbate income inequalities and worsen the&#13;
situation of the poorer groups.&#13;
Table II-1 shows rates of growth of population, GNP and GNP per&#13;
capita for the 1970-1977 period in selected countries, classified by low,&#13;
middle, and high per capita income in 1977. Per capita income increases&#13;
were minimal in low-income countries where the bulk of world population&#13;
resides; they suffered from a combination of slow economic growth and rapid&#13;
population growth. Economic growth was sufficient so that middle-income&#13;
countries as a group stayed ahead of population growth. Developed countries&#13;
achieved per capita income gains despite lower overall economic growth, as&#13;
population growth was low.&#13;
The table illustrates how, in at least a crude arithmetical&#13;
sense, population growth has exacerbated international income disparities.&#13;
But it also demonstrates that the relation between economic growth and&#13;
population growth is not a simple one. On the one hand, the experience of&#13;
the middle-income countries demonstrates that the two can go hand-in-hand;&#13;
rapid population growth has been accompanied by substantial gains in per&#13;
capita income. On the other hand, the possibility remains that with slower&#13;
increases in the number of people, total output would not have fallen&#13;
proportionately (or even not have fallen at all--though this seems unlikely),&#13;
so that per capita incomes would be higher; and that with slower population&#13;
growth, incomes of the poor within countries might have been higher, a&#13;
consideration which is particularly relevant for the middle-income countries&#13;
of Latin America.&#13;
The idea that rapid population growth slows per capita growth&#13;
and exacerbates inequality rests chiefly on two assumptions: first, that&#13;
rapid increases in labor force size lead to diminishing returns to the&#13;
relatively scarcer factors of production, land and capital, and thus a&#13;
reduction in wages relative to profits and rents; and second, that as the&#13;
ratio of dependents to workers increases, total savings in an economy&#13;
declines, preventing investments in education and in physical capital.&#13;
Whether these assumptions are valid, however, depends on other circumstances,&#13;
many of which can mitigate the effects of rapid population growth: growth&#13;
of the capital stock; the elasticity of substitution between different types&#13;
of labor, e.g. educated and uneducated, and between labor on the one hand&#13;
1/ In general, there is no necessary negative relation between population&#13;
density and poverty, nor even between density per unit of agriculturally&#13;
viable land and poverty. Where agriculture is highly capital and labor-&#13;
intensive, high yields can support large populations. Where an industrial&#13;
infrastructure already exists, dense populations can trade industrial&#13;
products for food. Indeed, where populations are thinly-spread, the&#13;
absence of economies of scale in transportation, communications and&#13;
service delivery may constrain development. There are poor countries&#13;
where high density combined with low levels of education and physical&#13;
capital is a problem. To these we turn below.&#13;

and land and capital on the other; and the extent to which technological&#13;
change is responsive to the relative scarcity of production factors and&#13;
encourages techniques which are intensive in the use of unskilled labor. As&#13;
a result, it is difficult to isolate the effect of population growth.&#13;
Economic-demographic models of the process must invariably make some simpli-&#13;
fying assumptions; and their results speak too often only to those already&#13;
converted--either to the relevance or irrelevance of rapid population&#13;
growth.&#13;
For this reason, the macroeconomic consequences of rapid popula-&#13;
tion growth in poor countries are still best considered in terms of straight-&#13;
forward description of demographic structure and trends in those countries.&#13;
We begin with age structure, then turn to trends in the growth of different&#13;
age groups; in the course of the discussion, the relevance of the facts&#13;
described to the macroscopic theory linking population to economic growth&#13;
and equality is mentioned. We then consider the effect of population growth&#13;
on food availability.&#13;
1. Age structure&#13;
As a result of high fertility, developing countries have much&#13;
more youthful populations than developed countries and consequently higher&#13;
dependency burdens. Table 11-2 summarizes the current differences in age&#13;
structure across countries categorized by current crude birth rates. The&#13;
high-fertility countries have about 45 percent of their populations under&#13;
the age of 15, the low-fertility countries between 20 and 25 percent. In&#13;
the United States there are two persons of working age for every one who is&#13;
too young or old to work; in Mexico and Nigeria there is only one. All&#13;
other things equal (but of course they never are), if per-worker income were&#13;
identical in Mexico and the U.S., per capita income would be about 30&#13;
percent higher in the U.S.&#13;
There is, however, surprisingly little hard evidence regarding&#13;
the effect of the higher dependency ratios of developing countries on sav-&#13;
ings. 1/ The assumption that at the household level, savings are reduced&#13;
as children increase consumption needs, fails to take into account the&#13;
1/   Leff (1969), in a cross-section study using 1964 data from 74 developed&#13;
and developing countries, examined the association between savings&#13;
rates and both the young- and old-age components of the dependency&#13;
burden. He concluded that the size of the dependency ratio has a&#13;
significant effect on savings, not only for the countries considered as&#13;
one group, but also within the two groups of developed and developing&#13;
countries. But the correlation is apparently reduced if a few demogra-&#13;
phically atypical Eastern European countries are excluded (Bilsborrow,&#13;
1973.)&#13;

possibility that parents save because of children--either to invest in chil-&#13;
dren s education or to accumulate physical wealth to pass on. Furthermore,&#13;
major sources of savings in today's developing countries are likely to be&#13;
less the household sector than the foreign, corporate and small business&#13;
sectors, and government; government can impose a high savings rate, regard-&#13;
less of the dependency burden, through taxation and credit policies.&#13;
2. Rates of increase of the school-age population&#13;
The effect of rapid population growth on the supply of savings is&#13;
unclear. But its effect on the demand for savings as a source of funds for&#13;
human resource investments, is clear. One obvious effect of rapid population&#13;
growth is rapid increases in the size of the school-age and working-age&#13;
populations, with resultant pressures on school systems and labor markets.&#13;
Rates of increase between 1950 and 1980 in the size of the school-age and&#13;
working-age populations of selected countries are shown in Tables 11-3 and&#13;
II-4. Figures II-1 and II-2 illustrate how these rates have affected growth&#13;
(and how projected rates, discussed in Part V, will affect future growth) of&#13;
these age groups in four countries:    Korea, where fertility began its&#13;
decline in the mid-1950s; Colombia, where fertility began to decline more&#13;
recently; and Mexico and Nigeria, where fertility is still high.&#13;
Between 1950 and 1970, the school-age populations of most develop-&#13;
ing countries grew at annual rates exceeding 3 and sometimes 4 percent&#13;
annually. In most Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil,&#13;
the size of this group more than doubled in that 20-year period. In Nigeria,&#13;
where infant and child mortality was higher, that group increased by 70&#13;
percent, from less than 9 to more than 15 million. Even in Korea, where&#13;
fertility began to decline in the 1960s, the group increased by about 66&#13;
percent, from 5.3 to 8.8 million, reflecting high earlier fertility rates.&#13;
In 1980 about 25 percent of the population of a typical developing&#13;
country is of school age, compared to 15 percent in developed countries&#13;
(Table II-2). Most countries, developed and developing, spent about&#13;
1.7 percent of GNP on primary education in 1975. 1/   In developing coun-&#13;
tries, spending per student was much lower because of lower GNP per capita.&#13;
And for a given amount of total spending, a typical developing country could&#13;
support its total school-age population only half as well. In general,&#13;
more children of school-age means more educational expenditures, or smaller&#13;
educational inputs per enrolled child, or lower enrollment ratios, or some&#13;
combination of all three. Conversely, one of the earliest economic effects&#13;
of a fertility decline is the reduction in the relative size of the school-&#13;
age cohort. In Colombia, a fertility decline which began in the mid-1960s&#13;
meant that the school-age group, the size of which doubled between 1950 and&#13;
1970, increased only slightly in size in the 1970s, and fell as a proportion&#13;
of the total population. In Korea, with lower fertility, the school-age&#13;
population as a proportion of the total has shrunk even more. These coun-&#13;
tries now have the option of increasing enrollment rates or spending more&#13;
per child; this should reduce inequality in the distribution of schooling&#13;
as the children of the poor are currently the least likely to be enrolled&#13;
in school and the most likely to be in the least-adequately funded schools.&#13;

3. Rates of increase of the working-age population.&#13;
As a group developing countries are burdened not only with the&#13;
high dependency ratios which large numbers of children entail, but with&#13;
very rapid labor force growth rates--the addition every year of many new&#13;
workers as the large cohorts of children become old enough to work. A&#13;
high dependency burden at a point in time, in other words, does not imply&#13;
that the size of the working-age group is not increasing rapidly through&#13;
time. (Even in countries where fertility has already begun to decline,&#13;
rapid growth of the labor force will continue until the end of this century.&#13;
In Korea, the size of the working-age population (ages 15 to 64) from which&#13;
labor force participants come will grow from 23 to 33 million between 1980&#13;
and the year 2000; in Colombia that group will grow from 16 to 25 million.)&#13;
The past growth rates of the working-age population, shown in&#13;
Table II-4, have meant a doubling or more of the working-age population in&#13;
the last 25 years for most developing countries; in the United States in&#13;
that period the working-age group increased by about 45 percent. 1/ The&#13;
rapid growth in developing countries does not necessarily lead to unemploy-&#13;
ment and poverty -- if, as implied above, the capital stock also grows and&#13;
is efficiently allocated, if appropriate labor intensive technologies are&#13;
developed for production in the urban sector, and if irrigation and other&#13;
inputs permitting more labor-intensive use of land are created in agricul-&#13;
tural areas. But these steps do require capital investments--and the more&#13;
rapid the growth of the labor force, the greater the required investment and&#13;
the greater the demand for alternative uses of available capital.&#13;
Table II-5 relates gross domestic investment in selected countries&#13;
in 1975 as a proportion of GDP to increases in the size of the labor force&#13;
in those countries. Investment per additional member of the labor force is&#13;
much higher in developed countries, largely because of higher absolute levels&#13;
of investment, with some effect of slower labor force growth. In the poorer&#13;
countries, rapid growth of labor force has a proportionately more powerful&#13;
effect on per-worker investment, since absolute levels of investment are low&#13;
anyway. In Kenya, India and Pakistan, if all investment were concentrated&#13;
on new entrants to the labor market, there would be less than $4,000 per&#13;
head available, compared to more than $100,000 in France, Japan and the&#13;
United States. 2/&#13;
1/   Even this increase was unusual for the U.S., reflecting in part the&#13;
baby boom there in the 1950s and early 1960s.&#13;
2/   See King, 1978, for a fuller discussion of these issues, and of the&#13;
conceptual difficulties in interpreting these types of data.&#13;
It is true that focusing on new workers exaggerates the differences&#13;
between developed and developing countries, compared to what a comparison&#13;
of investment per worker (new and old) would show. Amount of capital&#13;
per worker including all workers will change more slowly up or down than&#13;
investment per new entrant. Two flows are compared in the table; a&#13;
better indicator would be the change in the stock of capital per worker&#13;
across countries. But use of any measure of the capital stock raises&#13;
even more serious measurement and conceptual difficulties.&#13;

Such figures are only illustrative, given variations across&#13;
countries in the definition of the labor force, the fact that a single year&#13;
investment ratio may not represent the long term trend and the difficulty&#13;
of using conventional exchange rates for international comparisons. They&#13;
do indicate, however, the problems poor countries face in making the invest-&#13;
ments to assure that the less-privileged new members of rapiCeX..:-growing work&#13;
forces are not condemned to low-productivity, low-wage jobs in agriculture&#13;
or informal urban services.&#13;
Rapid growth of the labor force also means that, within the labor&#13;
force, a large portion of workers are young and inexperienced. To the&#13;
extent that experrence increases productivity, and there is considerable&#13;
evidence that it does, average productivity and average wage rates will be&#13;
lower in a youthful labor force, holding down per capita income and reducing&#13;
resources available for new investments. In the typical developing country,&#13;
50 percent of all persons aged 15 to 64 are under age 30, compared to 30 to&#13;
40 percent in developed countries. 1/ (The percentages for actual labor&#13;
force participants would differ even more, since in developed countries, the&#13;
schooling period is longer, and young persons enter the work force later).&#13;
Given any lags in the rate of adjustment to changes in the supply&#13;
of more and less-experienced workers, those who join the labor force as&#13;
members of relatively large cohorts are likely to face lower average wages&#13;
as they compete with each other for a relatively small number of job openings&#13;
for inexperienced workers.   The situation will be even worse for those with&#13;
little or no education if much of the aggregate rapid growth of the labor&#13;
force is made up of rapid growth of the unskilled, so that wage rates of the&#13;
unskilled fall relative to wage rates of the skilled. The wages of those&#13;
entering the U.S. labor force in the large postwar baby boom cohorts have&#13;
been talling relative to wages of peak earners, in all schooling groups. 2/&#13;
For developing countries, this effect could result in low average wages,&#13;
since young workers are a high proportion of all workers. On the other&#13;
hand, average levels of educational attainment of workers are increasing&#13;
rapidly in developing countries; given that education raises productivity&#13;
and wages 3/, the cohort effect could be offset.&#13;
1/   For example, 53.5 percent of the 15 to 64 year olds in Mexico are now&#13;
under age 30; the figure for the U.S. is 41 percent, reflecting the high&#13;
birth rates of the 1950s; for Japan it is 32 percent. These figures are&#13;
based on population estimates by age for 1980 used in the World Bank&#13;
population projections.&#13;
2/   In other words, workers with differing amounts of experience are imperfect&#13;
substitutes, at least initially. See Welch, 1979.&#13;
3/   On this issue, see Berry (1980), Bowman (1980) and Fields (1980), other&#13;
papers prepared as background for the 1980 World Development Report.&#13;

What role rapid labor force growth has actually played in inequal-&#13;
ity in developing countries is not at all clear. In the United States,&#13;
periods of rapid labor force growth have been periods of growing inequality&#13;
of worker incomes. For developing countries, there are not data over time on&#13;
both labor force growth and income distribution for a reasonable analysis of&#13;
the issue; and simulations based on    economic-demographic models have been&#13;
unconvincing because model-builders are invariably forced to make assump-&#13;
tions -- e.g. regarding savings rates -- which largely govern the results. 1/&#13;
It is in the rapidly growing middle-income countries of Latin America that&#13;
inequality may be the principal cost of rapid population growth; in Brazil,&#13;
for example, it is plausible that rapid growth of the unskilled portion of&#13;
the labor force has contributed to large wage differentials by education and&#13;
ainimal if any growth in unskilled wages rates. 2/&#13;
4. Population growth, population density and food availability&#13;
The effect of population growth on food availability has been a&#13;
serious concern since Malthus. For the developing countries as a whole,&#13;
food production grew faster than population in the 1960-75 period, at&#13;
annual rates averaging 3 percent. In many countries, however, growing&#13;
real incomes per head have meant that growth in demand has outpaced that of&#13;
output, and has been met increasingly by food imports. And in some of the&#13;
poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, food production did&#13;
not keep pace with population growth.&#13;
A fall in per capita food production is not in itself a problem,&#13;
as long as production in other sectors is increasing, and exports of other&#13;
goods provide the foreign exchange for food imports. But this has not been&#13;
the situation for most countries in Africa, where most of the labor force is&#13;
still engaged in agriculture. And this type of adjustment, for any country,&#13;
requires that resources be increasingly allocated to investment in nonagri-&#13;
cultural sectors--resources made scarcer on a per capita basis by rapid&#13;
population growth.&#13;
Since agricultural output requires labor, agricultural production&#13;
and population increases are not independent of each other; we certainly&#13;
cannot assume that had population growth been only half as great, growth in&#13;
food output per head would have been twice as large. It would also be&#13;
1/   Adelman and Robinson (1978) find that moderate rates of labor force&#13;
growth improve the lot of the poor, and reductions do not, in simula-&#13;
tions using a general equilibrium model. In the model, however, savings&#13;
rates are updated by means of an estimated relation between savings rates&#13;
and income levels, without any consideration (as they point out) of the&#13;
demographic dependency ratio. Labor force growth is in a sense exogenous;&#13;
it contributes to total output but there are no costs in "producing" the&#13;
labor force. Miore rapid labor force growth increases agricultural output&#13;
less than demand for agricultural products, improving the agricultural&#13;
terms of trade, which benefits the poor. but rural-urban migration with&#13;
lower overall growth could lead to the same overall result.&#13;

mistaken to attribute poor food-growing performance primarily to pressures&#13;
of population on land. Other factors, including distorted prices, lack of&#13;
credit, inadequate roads, lack of irrigation, and poor extension services,&#13;
are more important, particularly in Africa and Latin America, where densities&#13;
are relatively low, but also in Asia where densities are much greater. For&#13;
the world as a whole, the Ricardian spectre of diminishing returns to land&#13;
can still be stayed by capital investment and exploitation of new agricul-&#13;
tural technologies to increase yields. In short, continued increases in&#13;
population can be accomodated, but at some cost. Either agricultural yields&#13;
or output per capita in other sectors must be raised.&#13;
There are, moreover, a number of countries, and regions within&#13;
countries, where growing density combined with overall low levels of physi-&#13;
cal and human capital may be a cause of continuing poverty. In Egypt, Korea&#13;
and Bangladesh, the agricultural population per crop area in 1975 was twice&#13;
that in Japan and five times that in the Netherlands. 1/ In Korea, at least,&#13;
rapid industrialization and declining fertility mean the agricultural popula-&#13;
tion has peaked, and density need not be a long-run concern. In Bangladesh,&#13;
yields are still well below those of Egypt and Korea; an increase in yields&#13;
could solve the problem, but any such increase will require an expensive&#13;
solution to difficult water management problems and much more investment&#13;
in education of farmers. In Egypt, yields are close to those in developed&#13;
countries, there is no prospect of bringing new areas under cultivation, and&#13;
food imports are already significant. Rapid industrialization is the neces-&#13;
sary outlet, and this brings us back to the need for large capital investments&#13;
in the nonagricultural sector. Chinese yields are above those of Bangladesh&#13;
but below those of Egypt, and her population growth is reportedly slower than&#13;
either. Nevertheless it has evidently been difficult for China to raise&#13;
agricultural output much faster than that of population growth.&#13;
In other parts of the world, the pressure of population is causing&#13;
ecological deterioration, damaging farmers' immediate income prospects at the&#13;
local level, and diminishing the total land resources available to future&#13;
generations. Deforestation, soil erosion and the spread of deserts as a&#13;
consequence of overuse have been going on for centuries. But their effects&#13;
are felt by ever-larger local populations and of course are cumulative through&#13;
time. The Sahelian drought of 1968-73 affected the livelihood of perhaps 5&#13;
million people. 2/ In Western Rajasthan, India, as crop cultivation has been&#13;
extended to submarginal areas, the land available exclusively for grazing has&#13;
declined; between 1950 and 1961, the area available declined by 25 percent&#13;
while the population of grazing animals increased by 50 percent. In mountain&#13;
regions of the developing world -- in the Himalayas; the Andes and East Africa&#13;
-- soil erosion has resulted from overcropping and overgrazing, and the poten-&#13;
tial to support population has fallen. The increased runoff from eroding&#13;
upland areas of Nepal has caused flooding and siltation of canals and irri-&#13;
gation systems in the Indo-Gangetic plain where hundreds of millions of the&#13;
poorest members of the world population reside.&#13;
1/   The discussion of the density problem and of ecological deterioration is&#13;
based on data in King, 1978.&#13;
2/   Caldwell, 1975. The total population of the six countries most severely&#13;
affected was 25 million in 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Does rapid population growth exacerbate the situation of the poor&#13;
through its effect on food demand? The poor spend proportionately more&#13;
of their income on food. By maintaining demand for food products, rapid&#13;
population growth may prevent the reductions in the relative price of food&#13;
which .vuld benefit the urban poor and landless agricultural workers; on the&#13;
other hand, higher food prices do benefit poor farmers and may help landless&#13;
farm workers if production and the demand for their labor increases. When&#13;
much of the unskilled labor force is in agriculture, the pay position of&#13;
unskilled to skilled labor deteriorates less when demand for agricultural&#13;
products is relatively greater. In short, the situation varies from one&#13;
country to another; the indirect and countervailing effects of population&#13;
growth on food prices and on the situation of the poor can only be isolated&#13;
in carefully constructed country-specific models. 1/&#13;
There is little doubt that malnutrition in developing countries&#13;
is a widespread problem-.  But in the short run at least, income inequality&#13;
is a much greater barrier to improving the nutritional status of the poor&#13;
than is rapid population growth per se. The necessary increases in income&#13;
of the poorest quintile of the population in Cali, Colombia, to assure&#13;
adequate food consumption, even if food supply expanded rapidly enough&#13;
to keep prices constant (or population growth fell enough), were 19 percent&#13;
for calories and 43 percent for proteins in 1974. 2/&#13;
Effects at the Family Level: Family Size and Child Welfare&#13;
There is evidence that high fertility, and resultant large family&#13;
size, also have unfortunate effects at the family level. Most studies of&#13;
the micro consequences of family size have been carried out in developed&#13;
countries. But their implications are important for developing countries,&#13;
where average number of children in a family is greater, and where incomes&#13;
are lower. It is reasonable to expect that any adverse effects of large&#13;
family size on children's welfare are greater the lower is family income.&#13;
Children's height, intelligence and even survival probabilities&#13;
have *been found to be negatively related to their number of siblings in&#13;
a wide variety of studies in Europe, the United States and a few developing&#13;
countries. 3/ Some but not all studies included controls for socioeconomic&#13;
class; usually effects are stronger in lower classes, but prevail within&#13;
classes. When high fertility is associated with closely-spaced pregnancies,&#13;
resulting maternal health and nutritional problems can lead to low birth&#13;
weight of newborns and early weaning of infants, and poor health and nutri-&#13;
tion of children in the critical early years.&#13;
1/   In the Adelman-Robinson model of Korea, an exogenous reduction in&#13;
population growth worsened the terms of trade for agriculture and&#13;
increased inequality in a five-year period. See fn. 1 p. 35 above.&#13;
2/   Pinstrup-Anderson and Caicedo, 1978, Table 7 and p. 11, Table 8 and&#13;
p. 12.&#13;

1977.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
high fertility can handicap children intellectually as well as&#13;
physically. The ability of children to acquire learning is affected by the&#13;
time and quality of attention which they receive from parents and parent-&#13;
substitutes in the first few years of life; a large number of children may&#13;
strain not only parents financial resources but their emotional and physical&#13;
energies. 1/ Time use studies of mothers in the United Statcn show that the&#13;
time women spend in child care is not greater in large families; throughout&#13;
the childrearing years, educated women succeed in spending more time per child&#13;
with children principally by having fewer children. 2/&#13;
When large families adjust to economic constraints, there is some&#13;
evidence that the burden of deprivation falls heavily on the children. For&#13;
one thing, it is children who have the most to gain from the allocation of&#13;
family resources to long-term investments in child health and education.&#13;
Yet expenditure studies consistently indicate that increases in family size&#13;
necessarily shift family budgets toward more spending on food. Moreover,&#13;
even increases in food spending may not be in proportion to additions to the&#13;
family. In one Colombian town, the likelihood of malnutrition in preschool&#13;
children was directly related to the number of living children in their&#13;
families. 3/ Of course, this need not mean that it is large family size&#13;
which causes malnutrition; it may be that low income causes both high&#13;
fertility and malnutrition. In either case, however, the result is that&#13;
children from large, poor families are doubly disadvantaged.&#13;
Do poverty and large family size 4/ go hand-in-hand? The answer&#13;
depends critically on the way household income is measured. If income is&#13;
defined in per capita terms, family size at the low end of the income distribu-&#13;
tion tends to be greater than average, despite the higher rates of infant and&#13;
child mortality suffered by the poor. 5/ Tables II-6 and II-7 indicate that,&#13;
except in rural India, mean number of children increases and then decreases&#13;
using a total household income measure, but declines monotonically by income&#13;
1/   Mvany children are not invariably a burden to parents.    In part III the&#13;
circumstances under which many children increase parents     command of&#13;
resources are described.&#13;

group using the per-capita measure. From the point of view of child welfare,&#13;
and particularly with respect to investment by parents in child health and&#13;
education, the per capita measure is clearly preferable. 1/&#13;
The tables indicate that the link between large family size and&#13;
reduced investment in children is probably most strongly forged in Latin&#13;
America, where the difference between fertility rates of the rich and&#13;
poor is greatest. In Brazil, by the per capita measure, 60 percent of all&#13;
children live in the 40 percent of poorest households; these households&#13;
command less than 10 percent of total income. Even in Malaysia, however, it&#13;

households; these households command less than 13 percent of total income. 2/&#13;

income distributions, as in Tables II-6 and II-7, are well-known. In&#13;
addition to the issue of by what income measure quintiles should be classi-&#13;
fied, there are prior issues: whether the household, however defined, in&#13;
the proper unit of analysis; the measurement error in current income data;&#13;
the use of a money income measure rather than "full income"; the use of&#13;
current income when permanent income is the proper concept; 3/ and the fact&#13;
that comparisons of households in different stages of the "household" life-&#13;
cycle can be misleading, given that patterns of earning income vary consid-&#13;
erably with age. The last is especially relevant when the concern is chil-&#13;
dren's welfare. In many households, both the number of children and the&#13;
income of parents go up as the parents grow older; the question arises whether&#13;
income gains among the poor are sufficient to compensate for increases in&#13;
household size, a particular problem if the poor have limited access to&#13;
capital markets to save against future higher consumption needs as family&#13;
size increases. If increases in income with age and experience are greater&#13;
in skilled than unskilled jobs, then poor households may be "poorest", in&#13;
1/   For one thing, the distributions of total income include single person&#13;
households; many of these in developing countries consist of young people&#13;
with low total income but no children to support; these households are&#13;
shifted out of the poorer quintiles when a per capita measure is used.&#13;
2/   Visaria (1978) reports dependency ratios about 3 times as great in the&#13;
poorest as in the richest decile in Nepal, West Malaysia, Sri Lanka and&#13;
Taiwan, classifying households by per capita income. Dependency ratios&#13;
are lower in rural India here and in his data, perhaps reflecting the&#13;
greater prevalence of extended households.&#13;

permanent income concept see Bhalla, 1979.&#13;

the sense of having the least income proportionate to needs,'precisely in&#13;
the period when children are in preschool and school ages and can benefit&#13;
most from parents' investments of time and money. 1/&#13;
Even given all the conceptual difficulties, the tables make it-&#13;
clear that a large proportion of all children in developing countries grow&#13;
up in "poor" households. This poses a special challenge to human resource&#13;
development efforts geared to increasing the productivity and incomes of the&#13;
poor by increasing educational opportunities and improving health services.&#13;
A disproportionate share of poor children will come from the large families&#13;
that are least able to respond to such services. In Colombia and MNlyasia,&#13;
subsidies to households for health and education were similar across house-&#13;
holds grouped by income. 2/ But average number of children in the top&#13;
quintile of income in Colombia was 1.3, compared to 4.0 in the bottom&#13;
quintile. In Malaysia, there were 1.3 children in the top quintile and 3.6&#13;
in the bottom. As a result, government subsidies which were equal across&#13;
households were not equal across children. Taking number of children into&#13;
account, the subsidy to the richest quintiles was more than twice as great&#13;
as that to the poorest in both countries. Furthermore, evidence from urban&#13;
areas in Colombia indicates that the number of siblings a child has also&#13;
reduces the amount spend by parents on his or her education, even control-&#13;
ling for parent income and education; 3/ thus for children from large&#13;
families, both private and public spending on education are lower.&#13;
In short, large family size can compound the problem of low income&#13;
in reducing effective per-child demand for education, nutrition and other&#13;
basic goods and services. Early difficulties. in providing adequate nutri-&#13;
tion can interact with later difficulties in supporting schooling. As we&#13;
show below, children who receive less education are more likely as adults to&#13;
have many children themselves. From one generation to the next, an unequal&#13;
distribution of income is caused by and contributes to an unequal distribu-&#13;
tion of skills, as large family size and low investments in children go hand&#13;
in hand.&#13;
1/   Cross-section data probably exaggerate the inequality of lifetime in-&#13;
comes--but not by much in one sample, where a measure of permanent in-&#13;
come was constructed and results compared (Birdsall, 1979, Appendix A).&#13;
And even with inequality across households exaggerated, for poor house-&#13;
holds it is absolute changes in household income over the life-cycle&#13;
that matter, not their relative position vis-a-vis other households.&#13;

III. The Effects of Poverty of Fertility&#13;
The associations 'between socioeconomic indicators and fertility,&#13;
and between family planning services and fertility, provide only a limited&#13;
basis for predicting how future changes we associate with development&#13;
might affect future fertility. Virtually all such changes are highly&#13;
interrelated -- literacy, urbanization, increasing incomes, rising life&#13;
expectancy, even the ability of a government to launch and administer an&#13;
effective family planning program.   For prediction, and as a guide to policy,&#13;
we must ask which of any of such changes actually causes a shift to lower&#13;
fertility; which are most powerful in affecting a shift; and finally which&#13;
are most cost-effective, given as an objective the reduction of population&#13;
growth rates as one among several means of reducing poverty and accelerating&#13;
overall development.&#13;
These questions are at the heart of studies of the determinants&#13;
of fertility. From these studies has emerged a consensus on a least a few&#13;
factors which tend to reduce fertility: female education, reductions in in-&#13;
fant mortality, greater equality in the distribution of income insofar as it&#13;
raises the living standards of the poor; 1/ these are discussed briefly below.&#13;
There is, however, no real consensus on which, if any of these factors, is&#13;
necessary to a decline (even a decline in infant'mortality has been challenged&#13;
recently as a prerequisite, on the grounds that high unwanted fertility could&#13;
cause high infant mortality 2/). Nor is there agreement on the relative&#13;
importance of one or another factor, in part because the relevant variables&#13;
1/   See for example, Robert McNamara-s speech at MIT on the population&#13;
problem, and a recent publication of the Population Reference Bureau,&#13;
Our Population Predicament: A New Look.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
tend to be so closely interrelated. 1/ The issue of the relative costs of&#13;
influencing fertility is even more elusive; perhaps because most factors&#13;
which apparently reduce fertility are policy objectives in their own right,&#13;
cost studies have rarely been undertaken (the exception being early studies&#13;
of the costs and benefits of averting a birth through a family planning&#13;
program. 2/).&#13;
Two serious problems with most of the so-called determinants&#13;
literature should be made clear. The first is the dearth of studies which&#13;
include any information on the supply of family planning services; this&#13;
has resulted in lack of any real resolution of the relative importance&#13;
of the so-called "demand" or socioeconomic variables vs. the "supply" of&#13;
family planning. 3/  Two recent cross-country studies which included such a&#13;
variable are discussed in Part IV below.   Information on respondent's use of&#13;
family planning has been included in a few household studies, but the results&#13;
cannot be interpreted as indicating an independent effect of family planning&#13;
availability. 4/&#13;
1/   In an April 1979 paper on health and population in developing countries,&#13;
berelson, the dean of population policy work, and his co-authors Mauldin&#13;
and Segal wrote: "The theoretical position of the "basic determinants"&#13;
of fertility appears to be in considerable disarray: (their under-&#13;
lining) on the one hand, the received wisdom from traditional demographic&#13;
transition theory is increasingly challenged and qualified as more&#13;
becomes known, on the other hand the offered reformulations are not yet&#13;
widely accepted. Everything is always "more complicated than that." The&#13;
familiar list of "basic determinants" (like education, infant mortality,&#13;
industralization, urbanization), which factors to add (like income&#13;
distribution) or emphasize more (like women's status) or demote in&#13;
importance (like income level), the relative importance of such factors&#13;
in different places and times, even the concept itself -- all are in&#13;
question. As for the "threshold" notion as guide to policy, namely,&#13;
that fertility will decline when a certain economic and social level is&#13;
attained, that is even more in question. At the same time, a general&#13;
improvement in social setting is normally granted to have a substantial&#13;
impact on fertility decline, and perhaps improvement in only a few&#13;
critical factors will do (though such variables are so interrelated that&#13;
this is difficult in practice, despite Sri Lanka and the Kerala experi-&#13;
ence to the contrary.) In short, the situation is somewhat confused and&#13;
certainly less than satisfactory, not only for scientific theory but&#13;
perhaps even more for policy formulation."&#13;
2/   Estimates ranged from $1 to $400 on the cost side, and from $100 to $900&#13;
on the benefits side! See Birdsall 1977.&#13;
3/   This is an issue dealt with in the policy section, Part IV.&#13;
41   I.e. this variable is endogenous and its coefficient biased.    McGreevey&#13;
and von Elm, 1979, summarize several of these studies. See Butz and&#13;
Davanzo, 1978; Anderson, 1978. Schultz, 1974 used village-level vari-&#13;
ables reflecting contraceptive availability;-this is what is required for&#13;
an unbiased estimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
The second is the dearth of longitudinal studies, in part because&#13;
data over time both in changes in demographic rates and changes in socio-&#13;
economic conditions are difficult to obtain for more than a few countries.&#13;
If fertility declines in a few countries have been more rapid than the pace&#13;
of socioeconomic progress would suggest, then cross-section a-^lyses can&#13;
no longer offer a good guide to future magnitudes of fertility decline for&#13;
given amounts of socioeconomic change. Whether this is actually the case&#13;
awaits studies using data at several points in time; at the moment we do&#13;
know (see Part IV) that in a few countries, fertility has declined rapidly&#13;
not only because of shifts of persons from high to low fertility categories,&#13;
but because of rapid declines within categories, such as uneducated women;&#13;
whether income increases or other changes could explain the decline within&#13;
the category of uneducated women awaits multivariate analysis of longitudinal&#13;
data.&#13;
In the remainder of this section, we review the conventional&#13;
theory, which focuses on the family as the relevant decision-making unit.&#13;
The assumption of the theory is that the family is the locus of demographic&#13;
change -- the setting within which behavior regarding childbearing occurs&#13;
and within which the human resources of children are first nurtured. Amend-&#13;
ments to the theory which give to individuals within the family and to the&#13;
larger community some separate influence over fertility are mentioned. A&#13;
brief review of some correlates of fertility follows.&#13;
The Household Model of Fertility Demand&#13;
Why do the poor have large families? Is poverty a barrier to&#13;
continued fertility decline within countries? Will a contination of the&#13;
fertility decline be stalled, much as the mortality decline appears to have&#13;
been, if the fruits of economic growth and development are not transferred&#13;
to the poorer groups within populations?&#13;
Economists and other social scientists have developed a simple model&#13;
of family fertility behavior. 1/ The model explains why it is rational for&#13;
the poor to have large families, and it provides a guide to which of the&#13;
changes in the family's economic and social environment most affect fertility.&#13;
In the model, the child is a source of satisfaction, a "consumption" good.&#13;
But children are also "produced" in the household, through inputs of parents'&#13;
time and- through purchases by parents of housing, food, education and health&#13;
services for children. In fact, the model calls attention to the critical&#13;
role of parents in building up the human wealth of each subsequent generation.&#13;
Finally, children are a form of investment, short-term if they work during&#13;
childhood, long-term if they support parents in old age.&#13;
The model posits that increased income increases the family's&#13;
demand for children. How, then, does it account for the negative association&#13;
1/ E.g. Becker and Lewis, 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
between income and family size? There are two answers. The first is that,&#13;
as wage rates increase, alternative uses of time -- either to earn the higher&#13;
wages or to enjoy purchased goods -- increase the price of children relative&#13;
to other goods. As economic development raises wages (and thus the price of&#13;
time) children, a time-intensive good, become literally more expensive.&#13;
Because women are primarily responsible for childrearing, the rising price&#13;
of children operates chiefly through the increasing opportunity cost of the&#13;
mother's time as women's educational and employment opportunities increase,&#13;
and more generally as women's horizons expand beyond the family. Second, with&#13;
increasing income and access to health and education (i.e. a decline in the&#13;
relative price of such services with development), parents opt for healthier&#13;
and better-educated children, devoting more of their own time and income to&#13;
"producing" fewer children. Parents are most likely to seek increased educa-&#13;
tion for their children when they believe that their children's future work&#13;
opportunities will be governed less by class origin or family status than by&#13;
education and associated skills; when in other words they believe that for&#13;
given current costs of schooling their children, the returns to education&#13;
are positive. Of course, if schools are not within reasonable distance; if&#13;
accessible schools are of very poor quality; and if children's work is an&#13;
important component of family income, then the cost side of the schooling&#13;
investment calculus parents face may be so great as to make the investment&#13;
unreasonable.   The poorer are parents, the more likely that these costs of&#13;
schooling weigh heavily; in turn if children are not to go to school, it is&#13;
less costly to have many children.&#13;
Most poor families live in a low-wage environment, in which&#13;
children entail low costs or even a net benefit. The children of the&#13;
poor help at home and work outside of home at an early age. If children&#13;
contribute to parents' support in the parents' old age, the low current-costs&#13;
of raising children are a small premium to pay for insurance against future&#13;
uncertainties. Where mothers command only low wages, the difference between&#13;
children's and mothers' earnings may be small; work time lost by the mother&#13;
during a child's infancy may be easily recaptured by the child in later&#13;
years. Finally in low-wage settings, much of women's traditional work - in&#13;
agriculture, traditional crafts, and petty retailing -- can be combined with&#13;
care of children, so that children involve po opportunity cost at all.&#13;
Two other factors contribute to the link between poverty at the&#13;
household level and high fertility. One is the high rates of infant and child'&#13;
mortality in poor households. High fertility and high infant mortality are&#13;
causally linked in several ways, and these links are particularly strong for&#13;
low-income families. On the one hand, high infant mortality can result in&#13;
high fertility for biological reasons in non-contracepting populations; since&#13;
lactation delays the return of regular ovulation, an early infant death can&#13;
shorten the interval between birth and the next conception. Moreover, in&#13;
high-mortality settings, high fertility may be a behavioral response; parents&#13;
in high-mortality communities may insure themselves against future child loss&#13;
by having more children than they would ideally want. On the other hand,&#13;
high fertility can contribute to high infant (and child) mortality, if close&#13;
spacing of births and many births depletes the mother's physical resources&#13;
and reduces the family's per capita financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
The second factor is much less well-recognized as an integral&#13;
part of the standard demand, theory, but should not be overlooked. It&#13;
is that poor households tend to be in areas where modern and simple means&#13;
to restrict fertility are not easily available or if available are costly.&#13;
The model by no means implies that families, no matter how poor, have&#13;
an unlimited demand for children. Only in the extreme case might parents&#13;
have as many children as biology allowed, so that the total number would&#13;
be restricted only by the "supply" constraints of high fetal and infant&#13;
mortality and limited fecundity. 1/   More common is the situation where&#13;
parents must weigh the costs and benefits of having a certain number of&#13;
children in the face of the specific costs of avoiding children. For a&#13;
poor family in a rural area, where means of family limitation are confined&#13;
to abstinence, illegal abortion and infanticide, or to ineffective and diffi-&#13;
cult traditional contraceptives, the costs, psychic and other, of avoiding a&#13;
particular pregnancy may exceed the costs of having an additional child.&#13;
Even in urban areas, the costs of obtaining contraception through private&#13;
doctors may outweigh the additional cost of another children to.a poor house-&#13;
hold. Indeed, fertility demand theory, or at least popular understanding of&#13;
it, can be faulted for explaining "large" and "small" families, but failing&#13;
to distinguish among very large, large, medium, and small families. It is at&#13;
the margin that changes in the costs of having and avoiding children are bound&#13;
to affect decisions. The poor's desire for many children may preclude three&#13;
as not enough, but allow for four of five rather than six or eight. Thailand&#13;
and Colombia have had fertility declines of 30 percent in the last 15 years,&#13;
but still have total fertility rates of 4 or more, and desired family sizes&#13;
of about 4. 2/&#13;
How a reduction in the costs of avoiding births.might affect the&#13;
fertility of the poor can be considered more specifically in the light&#13;
of two amendments, or elaborations, of the fertility demand model.&#13;
Recent research on the family confirms the obvious: different&#13;
family members need not have perfectly congruent interests; 3/ certainly&#13;
with respect to children, it is. clear that the mother bears more of the&#13;
physical and usually more of the caretaking costs of children than the father.&#13;
In some cultures, the mother may even bear primary financial responsibility&#13;
1/   Easterlin (1976).   This might be the case in Nepal, Bangladesh (see&#13;
Amin and Faruqee, 1980) and some parts of Africa; but even among the&#13;
poorest groups in those countries, breastfeeding is prolonged and can&#13;
be interpreted as in part a means of keeping fertility below a biological&#13;
maximum.&#13;
2/ World Fertility Survey data.&#13;
3/   Cochrane and Bean, 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
for children; this is the case where marital disruption is frequent, where&#13;
unions are highly informal, and in Africa-, where polygamous marriages mean&#13;
one woman's children do not have a unique claim on their father's income or&#13;
assets. Where female contraception is relatively easy and its costs are low,&#13;
women can restrict their fertility even in the absence of complete cooperation&#13;
from husbands or other sexual partners. In fact, as we shall discuss more&#13;
below, access to contraceptive methods is a basic service denied to.too many&#13;
poor women in developing countries, regardless of their family size goals. .1/&#13;
A second addition to the model is to go beyond the nuclear family&#13;
or household as the sole unit of choice, and to consider how relatives,&#13;
friends, the community, the clan or village or even the national government&#13;
(through propo6anda or tax incentives) impinge on and affect the individual'&#13;
couple's behavior by affecting the social cost of unusual behavior. The&#13;
apparent success of community-level cooperation in supporting use of modern&#13;
family planning services in Indonesia indicates that fertility behavior is&#13;
not uniquely determined, by the characteristics of the individual woman or&#13;
couple.&#13;
The model implies that variables critical to a reduction in the&#13;
fertility of the poor are: reductions in infant mortality; alternatives for&#13;
poor women via educational and work opportunities; an increase in the per-&#13;
ceived costs of children to poor parents; and an increase in the availabil-&#13;
ity of low-cost family planning services and the acceptability of their use.&#13;
The entire question of family planning services we leave to part IV. Here we&#13;
review evidence regarding the other variables from studies of differences in&#13;
fertility across households as well as across countries. In addition to those&#13;
named, we also discuss urbanization, income distribution and age at marriage as&#13;
correlates of fertility, since these interact with those named above in ways&#13;
critical to fertility patterns.&#13;
Some Correlates of Fertility&#13;
1. Infant mortality&#13;
Across countries, life expectancy, an important component of&#13;
which is infant mortality, is the single best predictor of fertility rates.&#13;
No country with a crude death rate above 15 per thousand has achieved a&#13;
1/   In developed countries, the battle for women's right to birth control&#13;
methods began long before governments became concerned about world pop-&#13;
ulation growth. Of course, there are circumstances in which women might&#13;
want more children than men, e.g. where they have no alternative sources&#13;
of satisfaction or of support when old. In Bangladesh, for example, sons&#13;
are virtually women's only safeguard against future economic misfortune&#13;
(Cain et. al., 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
birth rate below 30 per thousand. 1/ The relationship holds across states&#13;
in India and Brazil, and across households in Taiwan. In Colombia, at&#13;
every parity, women who suffered the loss of a child were more likely to&#13;
have another; in Turkey and Egypt, couples who had lost a child both had&#13;
and expected more children than those who had not, even controlling for&#13;
socioeconomic differences. 2/&#13;
In general, families that suffer infant and child mortality do&#13;
not completely replace a lost child, i.e., infant and child mortality leads&#13;
to somewhat smaller family size, and thus overall lower rates of population&#13;
growth, than what might otherwise prevail, all other things equal. But seldom&#13;
in real life are all other things equal; studies to date have not been able to&#13;
incorporate the indirect and long-run effect of reduced mortality: lower&#13;
death probabilities should eliminate parents' need for extra births to insure&#13;
against possible loss, and should induce parents to invest more in a smaller&#13;
number of children. In other words, lower mortality not only assists parents&#13;
to achieve desired family size with fewer births; it may lead parents to&#13;
reduce their desired family size.&#13;
Moreover, it is also possible that high fertility causes high mor-&#13;
tality. 3/ In societies where families struggle not only with low income&#13;
but with inadequate health services, both factors may obtain: high fertility&#13;
and high infant mortality are mutually reinforcing. Where high mortality con-&#13;
tributes to high fertility, lowering mortality is a prerequisite to lowering&#13;
fertility. In the short run, lower mortality may raise the rate of population&#13;
growth (indeed it is the lowering of mortality which caused the spurt in popu-&#13;
lation growth in developing countries in the 1950 to 1965 period). The criti-&#13;
cal issue is how to minimize that short run, i.e. minimize the lag between a&#13;
change in prevailing levels of mortality and the reduction of family size&#13;
goals. To the extent that future mortality declines depend less on external&#13;
public health interventions, and more on the factors which also directly reduce&#13;
fertility, such as improvements in education and better health services (see&#13;
Section I), the lag in the future should be shorter than it has been in the&#13;

Report, 1979.&#13;
3/   In a recent discussion, Scrimshaw (1978) names three types of evidence to&#13;
support the latter possibility: anthropological and historical evidence&#13;
of infanticide in many societies, including 19th century Western Europe;&#13;
current evidence of higher infant and child mortality of females than&#13;
males in India, Ecuador and Bangladesh, suggesting parental underinvest-&#13;
ment in the health and nutrition of girl babies; and higher mortality of&#13;

indicating that behavioral as well as biological factors contributed.&#13;

past. Emphasis on education of women, which reduces both mortality 1/ and&#13;
fertility, is one way to assure that fertility falls rapidly in response to&#13;
reduced mortality. Provision of family planning services as part of an im-&#13;
proved health system would also reduce the lag. Finally, for any populations&#13;
(or groups within populations) among whom high and unwanted fertility con-&#13;
tributes to high mortality, family planning can make a separate contribution&#13;
to reduced mortality, over and above its direct effects on fertility.&#13;
2. Female education, labor force participation and status&#13;
Female education bears one of the strongest and most consistent&#13;
negative relationships to fertility. In the poorest countries, women with&#13;
some primary schooling have slightly higher fertility than women with no&#13;
education at all; this is consistent with the positive effect of income on&#13;
fertility at subsistence income levels, described below. Women with completed&#13;
primary schooling, however, virtually always have lower fertility than those&#13;
with no schooling at all, and fertility declines monotonically as mother's&#13;
education increases above primary schooling. 2/&#13;
In studies using family data, women's education has a stronger and&#13;
more consistently negative effect on fertility than does men's education. 3/&#13;
There are several plausible reasons for this. The opportunity cost of chil-&#13;
dren is higher to women than men, and increases the greater a woman's educa-&#13;
tion. Education delays marriage for women, either because of the schooling&#13;
process itself, because educated women are more likely to work, or because&#13;
educated women take more time to find suitable partners. 4/ Education may&#13;
have an important effect on women's willingness and ability to plan for the&#13;
future and to pursue activities outside the family. Finally, education&#13;
improves the likelihood that a woman has knowledge of and can use modern&#13;
contraceptives; and may influence the speed with which a woman accepts a new&#13;
method of family limitation.&#13;
The effect of female education on fertility provides an additional&#13;
justification for rectifying the imbalance where boys attend school at higher&#13;
rates and for longer periods than girls, even given the fiscal and admin-&#13;
istrative burdens involved in expanding formal enrollment where it is low&#13;
and where social norms might require separate schools for girls. Improving&#13;
opportunities for girls is easily justified, anyway, as better-educated women&#13;
will be more productive workers and better mothers. Though female labor&#13;

force participation appears to have an independent effect on fertility only&#13;
for those women who work in high-wage, modern sector jobs, some increase in&#13;
work opportunities for women should affect fertility indirectly by raising&#13;
the incentive to educate girls. The ratio of female to male enrollments is&#13;
lowest in countries of the Middle East, where employment and other activities&#13;
outside the home for women are extremely limited. 1/ In the current genera-&#13;
tion, parents may restrict their own fertility to invest more in the education&#13;
of a few children, including girls; in the next generation, those girls' own&#13;
fertility will be lower due to their schooling.&#13;
In addition to encouraging and supporting better education and&#13;
work opportunities for women, governments can lay the groundwork for improve-&#13;
ments in the status of women by guaranteeing to women property rights, the&#13;
right to sue, inheritance rights, and marriage and divorce rights, includ-&#13;
ing the right to participate in 'the choice of a husband. The general status&#13;
of 'women in a community or society may in turn affect a particular women's&#13;
ability to influence intra-household decisions regarding fertility.' Improving&#13;
women's opportunities for education and through education for modern 'jobs has&#13;
it own justification; the fertility-reducing effects of programs to improve&#13;
women's lives increases the measured benefits of such programs relative to&#13;
their costs.&#13;
3.  The "costs of children"&#13;
There is considerable debate concerning whether the children of&#13;
poor parents end up giving or getting, i.e. whether in addition to whatever&#13;
emotional and psychological benefits children entail for all parents, poor&#13;
parents also gain financially when they have an additional child. The authors&#13;
of two studies in the poorest of settings -- Bangladesh and Indonesia --&#13;
concluded that children are a net financial benefit to parents. 2/ A study&#13;
of the same question for one village in India and among less poor rural&#13;
inhabitant's of Taiwan concluded children end up costing parents. 3/- The&#13;
studies are not comparable -- it may only be a coincidence that in the poorer&#13;
settings, the costs of children were negative.' Unfortunately, such studies&#13;
require a host of assumptions', assumptions regarding the appropriate rate&#13;
of discount for children's future earnings; the marginal utility to parents of&#13;
insurance against risks at various points in their life-cycle when children&#13;
might assist; and the marginal disutility of losing a-child and thus their&#13;
investment in high-mortality settings. In situations, such as India,&#13;
I/   In Muslim countries, e.g. Indonesia, where female education is more&#13;
common, so is female labor force participation.&#13;

where sons might on net contribute to parents' income but daughters not,&#13;
some account must be taken of the probability of having a son and having&#13;
a son survive -- and the resultant benefits must be sufficient to offset&#13;
the costs, given the probability of having a surviving daughter. 1/&#13;
How parents come out in such a complicated calculation is probably&#13;
less important than the fact that they live under conditions in which s'uch a&#13;
calculation is relevant. Even if parents do gain, it is clear that children&#13;
in such an environment lose -- since the parents overall gain is likely to&#13;
be associated with low investments in the health and education of children.&#13;
When high fertility of parents is motivated by economic gain, the first step&#13;
must be to relieve what must be the desperate poverty and uncertainty regarding&#13;
their own future, of parents. Only in that context are policies geared to&#13;
increasing the cost of children -- one often mentioned is enforcement of child&#13;
schooling laws -- reasonable.&#13;
In less desperate conditions changes in the socioeconomic environ-&#13;
ment which increase the incentive for parents to spend more -- both time&#13;
and money -- on their children may be important. One such change, already&#13;
mentioned, is the increased probability that children will survive to adult-&#13;
hood; historians of the family now claim that mothers in preindustrial Europe&#13;
in the face of high infant and child mortality (and possibly unwanted high&#13;
fertility), wave little time or attention to newborns. 2/ A second change&#13;
is an increase in the importance of education. In Nigeria and Taiwan, parents&#13;
who hoped to educate their children expected and had fewer of them. In India,&#13;
Colombia, and the United States, children with fewer siblings go further in&#13;
school. These findings suggest that parents restrict fertility in order to&#13;
send children to school; or at least that the same conditions which lead&#13;
parents to school their children are also conducive to reduced fertility. 3/&#13;
When expansion and extension of schooling opportunities to poor children&#13;
occurs in an environment in which parents can anticipate that their children&#13;
will benefit from increased schooling, i.e. in which class, caste and family&#13;
background are not impenetrable barriers to upward mobility, then increased&#13;
access to schooling should be accompanied by reduced fertility, as parents&#13;
see the merits of investing more in each child and reduce fertility in order&#13;
to do so. Indeed, this argument implies that extension of education can&#13;
affect not only the future fertility levels of children now in school, but&#13;
the current fertility of adults.&#13;
1/   Cassen, 1978, pp. 63-74, does the calculation and provides a thorough&#13;
discussion of the problems.&#13;
2/   Shorter, 1975.&#13;
3/   The negative association alone does not tell us whether lower family size&#13;
leads to increased schooling of children, or the desire for increased&#13;
schooling leads to lower fertility. See Birdsall, 1979 for a simultaneous&#13;
equations model in which the two effects are distinguished.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. Urbanization&#13;
Despite the common assumption that the cost-benefit ratio of&#13;
children increases in urban areas (principally because children are believed&#13;
to work more in rural areas), there is no real evidence that residence in&#13;
an urban area per se reduces fertility. In Table III-1 two-way tabulations&#13;
of children-ever-born by mother's education and residence are presented;&#13;
in general, increased education is more negatively related to fertility&#13;
than urban residence. 1/ Studies in the early 1970s in Egypt, Indonesia&#13;
and Nigeria all reported slightly higher fertility in urban areas, par-&#13;
ticularly among the least-educated. 2/ In Thailand, regional analysis&#13;
showed urbanization in 1960 to be significantly related to a fall in the&#13;
number of children ever born between 1960 and 1970 only in one region. 3/&#13;
In Latin America, urban fertility rates are lower, but a good part of the&#13;
urban-rural differential can be attributed to differences in education&#13;
levels and family planning services. 4/ Urban residence is certainly not&#13;
a sufficient condition for lower fertility; and the decline of fertility&#13;
in rural areas of Taiwan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Colombia indicates it is&#13;
not necessary.&#13;
In some countries, urban residence may be a prerequisite to other&#13;
changes in a person's life which do lower fertility -- such as increased&#13;
education, better opportunities for children, etc. In controlling for these&#13;
direct effects, we may underestimate the underlying importance of the change&#13;
in residence.  Still, those other changes can occur in a rural setting (the&#13;
above countries being examples). In short, it is the partial escape from&#13;
the conditions of poverty which lowers fertility; whether the necessary&#13;
changes can be most cheaply introduced in urban areas, with migration&#13;
assumed, or in rural areas, depends on local conditions and is a separate&#13;
issue.&#13;
5. Income distribution&#13;
The relationship between income and fertility is not linear, but&#13;
closer to that shown in Figure III-1. At extremely low incomes, where&#13;
fecundity may be impaired by malnutrition and disease, increases in income may&#13;
1/   In fact, for countries in which women are grouped by age since first&#13;
marriage, the figures in the tables probably underestimate differences -&#13;
by education. Msarriage is later for more-educated women, who are there-&#13;
fore older and closer to completed fertility.&#13;

increase fertility, at least up to a point. 1/ Above that "threshold", further&#13;
increases are associated with falling fertility; this is why the bivariate&#13;
relationship between income and fertility (Figure 1-3 above) is negative&#13;
across countries.&#13;
It is also the case, as shown in the figure, that marginal decreases&#13;
in fertility for given increases in income are greater at lower incomes; in&#13;
other words, in terms of fertility decline, there are diminishing returns to&#13;
income increases. Thus raising the income of the rich (this applies to rich&#13;
countries, and to rich groups within countries) reduces fertility less than&#13;
raising the incomes of the poor; (indeed, at very high incomes, there is some&#13;
evidence that increasing income increases fertility). 2/ The threshold income&#13;
level above which fertility begins to decline is not high; only in the poorest&#13;
countries of Africa and South Asia would we expect more than a small propor-&#13;
tion of the population to be below the threshold. 3/&#13;
Because the simple negative relation between income and fertility&#13;
is nonlinear, and because most households in most countries fall in the range&#13;
to the right of the threshold, countries and regions where the share of low-&#13;
income groups in total income is greater have lower aggregate fertility rates.&#13;
Fertility has fallen more where the distribution of income has become more&#13;
equal (Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Taiwan) than where it has not (India, Brazil,&#13;
Puerto Rico). 4/ In a recent cross-country analysis using World Bank data,&#13;
a variable representing the share of income of the poorest 40 percent of&#13;
households was as powerful -- in the sense of statistical significance -- in&#13;
explaining 1970 fertility rates as were life expectancy and literacy var-&#13;
iables. 5/ In fact, the income distribution variable, along with either&#13;
literacy or life expectancy and controlling for GNP per capita, explained&#13;
about 80 percent of the total variation in fertility rates; and the omission&#13;
of that variable reduced the overall explanatory power of equations by about&#13;
20 percentage points.&#13;
Unfortunately, neither this nor earlier studies using aggregate data&#13;
tell us whether the share of the poor's income affects their fertility over&#13;
and above the effect of the absolute level of their income, which clearly does&#13;
1/   Actually, prevailing levels of malnutrition probably do not reduce&#13;
fecundity (Bongaarts, 1979); but famine and disease could.&#13;
2/   This point is made most forcefully by Repetto, 1979.&#13;
3/   Kirk (1971, pp. 142-143) estimated that threshold to be as low as&#13;
$125 in East Asia (1965 prices) and about $300 in Latin America for&#13;
countries as a whole. Bell (1976) reports only minimal decline in&#13;
fertility until per capita income reaches $300 (1970 prices and data),&#13;
based on his nonlinear estimation of fertility as a function of country&#13;
per capita income.&#13;
4/   Repetto, 1974, Table 6, pp. 29-30.&#13;
5/  ixioravetz, 1978, Table 1, p. 1253.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
matter (because of the nonlinear income effect) and which in cross-country&#13;
studies is captured by their share, once per capita income is held constant.&#13;
It is possible that the share of income of the poorest groups affects the&#13;
speed with which new information such as the lower costs of avoiding children,&#13;
initially available only to the privileged in a society, is diffused to and&#13;
acted upon by the poor. Or the poor's share might be a proxy for the amount&#13;
of upward mobility poss:ible in a society; the possibility of upward mobility,&#13;
for themselves or their children, could reduce the desired fertility of the&#13;
poor. But whether the diffusion or mobility effect is related to the distri-&#13;
bution of income in societies we really do not know.&#13;
In any event, because of the diminishing returns of income growth&#13;
to fertility at high levels of income, the growth of income of rich countries&#13;
and of rich groups within countries has virtually no fertility-reducing&#13;
effect. In absolute terms, less than 15 percent of global income growth&#13;
between 1960 and 1973 went to countries with per capita incomes below $1,000&#13;
in 1973, countries that include about 75 percent of the world population.&#13;
The remaining 85 percent of income growth occurred in countries to the right&#13;
in Figure III-1 -- where only 25 percent of the world population resides and&#13;
where it was irrelevant to further fertility declines. 1/&#13;
6. Age at marriage&#13;
Insofar as marriage, either formal or consensual, is a prerequisite&#13;
to childbearing -- and for the majority of women in virtually all developing&#13;
societies it is -- an increase in the female age at marriage can affect&#13;
the rate of population growth in two ways not linked to marital fertility&#13;
behavior. It shortens the period during which women are exposed to pregnancy,&#13;
and shortens it in the ages when fecundity is high; and it lengthens the&#13;
interval between generations.&#13;
In addition, there may be behavioral effects on fertility of late&#13;
marriage. Of course women who marry later may fave fewer children simply&#13;
because the same factors which lead to later marriage -- such as greater&#13;
education and employment opportunities -- also directly reduce fertility.&#13;
but it is also possible that later marriage assures individual women more&#13;
time to explore interests beyond family and childbearing, interests which&#13;
1/   Based on Repetto (1979, Table 6-4, p. 166); he uses "demographic&#13;
effectiveness weights for income growth" which are based on a cross-&#13;
country ordinary least squares regression of fertility rates on&#13;
income per capita and income per capita squared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
they take with them into married life and which moderate their fertility&#13;
goals. 1/&#13;
An increase in average age at marriage is most closely associated&#13;
with declining fertility in Asia. In the 1960s, changes in the percent&#13;
married accounted for about half as much of the crude birth rate decline as&#13;
did changes in marital fertility in South Korea, Taiwan and West Malaysia,&#13;
and were even more important than marital fertility declines in Sri Lanka&#13;
and the Philipppines. 2/ The People's Republic of China has placed major&#13;
emphasis on later marriage as part of its birth reduction program, but there&#13;
are no data on the quantitative effect of later marriage there on fertility.&#13;
In Latin America, increases in the age of marriage have been less important-&#13;
to overall fertility decline, in part because average age at marriage was&#13;
already relatively high compared to Asia and in part because much of the&#13;
fertility decline in countries such as Chile, Costa Rica and Colombia has&#13;
been associated with truncation of childbearing by older women. Fertility&#13;
is generally high and age at marriage low throughout Africa and the Middle&#13;
East, perhaps because in the Middle East and to some extent among the large&#13;
Muslim populations of Africa, options for women outside marriage and child-&#13;
bearing are limited. 3/ One exception is Tunisia, where average marriage&#13;
age has risen by about two years since 1957; it is now about 23, and over&#13;
90 percent of women aged 15 to 19 are single. In part the rise may have been&#13;
due to a shortage of young single men, many of whom migrated out to work&#13;
1/ If age at marriage is associated with reduced fertility only because&#13;
women who marry later are different -- have more education, prefer&#13;
non-familial activities -- the variable age at marriage does not belong&#13;
in multivariate analyses of the determinants of fertility; this is&#13;
especially the case if women marry later as a means of lowering their own&#13;
fertility.  If age at marriage is affected by events over which a woman&#13;
has no control, e.g. a dearth of eligible partners due to war, or a&#13;
women's being unusually unattractive, or strong social sanctions against&#13;
early marriage, as in China, it could be argued that age of marriage is a&#13;
proxy for those factors, in determining fertility. Thus some would argue&#13;
that if only a small part of age at marriage is explained by exogenous&#13;
factors, it should be included in a multivariate analysis. In his&#13;
cross-country analysis, Wheeler (1980) found that adding age at marriage&#13;
to a regression explaining fertility did not increase the amount of&#13;
variance explained over that explained by life expectancy and literacy&#13;
alone, (pp. 96-100).&#13;
2/ Mauldin, 1978, Table 7, p. 82. The other factor accounting for crude birth&#13;
rate change is change in age composition.&#13;
3/ For example, though the singulate mean age at marriage has risen by more&#13;
than two years since 1961 in Bangladesh and Pakistan, it is still low in&#13;
both countries: 16.5 (1974) and 19.6 (1975) respectively. In most Latin&#13;
American countries, it is above 20. (Youssef, 1979, Table 3). See also&#13;

elsewhere. But in the same period, education for women expanded considerably&#13;
(enrollments in the first and second levels increasing from 27 to 47 percent&#13;
between 1960 and 1970); President Bourguiba gave support to the notion that&#13;
women should play a stronger role in modern society; and the government&#13;
initiated a family planning program. The decline in fertility in Tunisia has&#13;
not matched that in the countries of East Asia, but it exceeds the decline in&#13;
neighboring countries of North Africa. Still, the decline is due less to&#13;
changing fertility of young women than to lower fertility of older women; some&#13;
of the factors which increased average age at marriage may also have reduced&#13;
overall fertility.&#13;
The importance of late marriage to fertility decline should diminish&#13;
as safe and effective contraceptives become more widely available. In fact&#13;
as age at marriage rises, the likelihood of premarital female sexual activity&#13;
may also rise, weakening the link between marriage and childbearing. On&#13;
the other hand, by 1990 there will be twice as many potential parents in&#13;
the reproductive ages 15 and 29 as there were in 1960; even with sharp reduc-&#13;
tions in marital fertility, population growth will continue to be rapid well&#13;
into the 21st century if as a group they marry young and reproduce early.&#13;
Though efforts to raise the age at marriage by persuasion and edict have&#13;
not been particularly successful, with the possible exception of China (the&#13;
median legal minimum age at marriage among all countries is still very low&#13;
age 15), legislation is a way for governments to encourage social support&#13;
for higher marriage ages; and governments can link the idea of later age at&#13;
marriage to specific programs, especially female schooling, which affect&#13;
fertility directly as well as indirectly via marriage age.&#13;

IV. Population Policy: The Case for Family Planning Programs&#13;
Reduction of population growth rates is not an end in itself,&#13;
but one among several means to the end of improving human welfare. With the&#13;
important exceptions of Brazil and many of the sub-Saharan countries, most&#13;
countries now recognize the macroeconomic and social costs of rapid popula-&#13;
tion growth. An estimated 78 percent of the population of the developing&#13;
world lives in the roughly 35 countries with an official policy to reduce&#13;
population growth, and it is the countries with the largest populations which&#13;
are most actively committed to the goal of reducing population growth. 1/&#13;
(The 13 most populous countries and their positions with respect to population&#13;
are tabulated in Table IV-1.)&#13;
An additional 14 percent lives in countries in which there is&#13;
official support of family planning programs for other than demographic&#13;
reasons; even where the issue is seen as a private rather than a social one,&#13;
the right of individual couples to space and limit childbearing if they&#13;
choose is respected, arid sometimes actively supported by publicly-funded&#13;
family planning programs. 2/&#13;
A population "policy" need not be confined to support of family&#13;
planning. The recognition that living standards -- especially education and&#13;
access to basic health services -- influence mortality rates, and that educa-&#13;
tion and mortality affect fertility, has grown; as part of their population&#13;
policy, some countries therefore now consider the demographic as well as&#13;
other effects of policies and programs to promote social change. A few&#13;
countries have used housing and tax policies (Singapore) to discourage large&#13;
family size, and direct payments to encourage sterilization (India, where for&#13;
a time the system was abused, and Sri Lanka). China recently announced&#13;
that it was instituting, in at least some urban areas, a set of bonuses&#13;
and preferences for one-child families, and tax and housing disincentives&#13;
for families with more than two children.&#13;
For the most part however, support of family planning is the most&#13;
widely accepted and practical aspect of population policy. In this section&#13;
family planning is first discussed as a component of population policy and&#13;
contributor'to reduced fertility. We then turn to the equally important&#13;
issue of family planning as a basic service to which the poor still have&#13;
unequal access in most countries. The section should be read in conjunction&#13;
with the preceding sections in which other factors linking poverty and rapid&#13;
population growth have been reviewed.-&#13;

The Case for Family Planning: Fertility-Reducing Effects&#13;
Efforts to isolate the fertility-reducing effect of family planning&#13;
have until recently been plagued by difficulties of inadequate data and poor&#13;
methods in using what data have been available. In countries where the&#13;
existence of a family planning program has been correlated over time with a&#13;
decline in fertility, assurance that the program itself caused the decline&#13;
requires the systematic elimination of such other possible causes as increases&#13;
in income, changes in occupational structure, and increases in education. Few&#13;
studies of the effect of programs have adequately controlled for the effects&#13;
of these nonprogram changes on fertility. Studies based on cross-section data,&#13;
either of households or regions within a country, or of countries, have a&#13;
different problem: though data on income, education and other socioeconomic&#13;
variables are usually available across the units analyzed, data on the avail-&#13;
ability of family planning services are usually not. Unfortunately data on&#13;
use of family planning cannot substitute for data on its availability (though&#13;
the two are clearly related) since use is not independent of fertility goals&#13;
and is no indication of what difference services would make to those to whom&#13;
they are not available. 1/&#13;
Among policymakers and planners, lack of complete agreement on&#13;
the relative importance of the supply of family planning services vs. the&#13;
demand factors -- education, lower mortality -- in reducing fertility, has&#13;
therefo're not been surprising. However, a consensus has emerged that a&#13;
reasonable policy to reduce fertility should be based both on socioeconomic&#13;
change and provision of family planning, with emphasis on providing services&#13;
where they would be cost-effective, i.e. in settings where levels of develop-&#13;
ment sutgested demand for the services would exist.&#13;
The logic of this emerging consensus is supported by the findings&#13;
of two recent cross-country analyses of fertility decline in developing coun-&#13;
tries. Both studies have taken advantage of the fact that fertility data (i.e.&#13;
crude birth rates) are now available for many developing countries for more&#13;
than one point in time, and both also used a new index of the family planning&#13;
effort of governments, 2/ as xmeasured" in the early 1970s.   The index is&#13;
based on 15 programmatic criteria including such factors as the overall avail-&#13;
ability of services, the inclusion of fertility reduction in official planning&#13;
policy, the adequacy of the family planning administrative structure, use of&#13;
mass media, extent of training and evaluation, use of field workers, and the&#13;
degree to which leaders publicly support a program. Countries received a&#13;
score of 0, 1 or 2 for each of the 15 criteria, giving a range from 0 to 30&#13;
1/   See Part III, p. 44 for references to household studies incorporating&#13;
some measure of family planning use.&#13;
2/   The index was first proposed by Robert Lapham and Parker Mauldin.    It&#13;
was first used in empirical work by Ronald Freedman and Bernard Berelson,&#13;
and then by Parker Mauldin and Bernard Berelson in Mauldin and Berelson,&#13;
1978. Wheeler (1980) refers to it as the Mauldin-Berelson index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
for each country. 1/ (The criteria and resultant scores are shown in Appendix&#13;
A.)&#13;
Using this index as well as indicators of socioeconomic level of&#13;
development, Mauldin and Berelson (1978) found that between 1965 and 1975&#13;
fertility declined most in those countries which had strong family planning&#13;
programs and were at relatively advanced levels of socioeconomic development:&#13;
Korea, Costa Rica, Cuba. Fertility declined somewhat where general levels of&#13;
development were high, even in the absence of strong family planning: Brazil&#13;
and Turkey.  However, it also declined   somewhat where development levels were&#13;
low but family planning programs were moderately strong: India and Indonesia.&#13;
Aside from India and Indonesia only the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was&#13;
among countries with low ranking of development indicators and a strong family&#13;
planning effort. 2/ Not surprisingly, where there was little development',&#13;
there were not strong programs (e.g. Pakistan and Bangladesh).&#13;
In a comparable analysis, done as one component of a broader study&#13;
of interaction between human resource development and economic growth, Wheeler&#13;
(1980) reports, using somewhat differently-defined predetermined variables&#13;
(changes in income, literacy, etc. over the period 1970-1977, rather than&#13;
levels at the beginning of the period) similar results. Family planning adds&#13;
to the effects of socioeconomic variables in explaining fertility change in&#13;
developing countries, and is itself largely explained by current fertility&#13;
and countries' institutional capacity. 3/&#13;
The cross-country data analyses, indicating that a strong family&#13;
planning program can have some fertility-reducing effect, are complemented&#13;
by several country examples of apparent family planning success, the most&#13;
frequently-cited being China and Indonesia. In those countries, both still&#13;
large rural and of relatively low incomes, there has been substantial govern-&#13;
ment effort to assure access to family planning services for the mass of&#13;
people in villages.   Though  reliable data are not available for China, even a&#13;
conservative estimate of the current crude birth rate puts it at about 25, 4/&#13;
1/   The scores were built up on the basis of ratings by several people *for&#13;
each country.  The scores assigned may have been influenced by persons'&#13;
knowledge of fertility declines in the countries.   But this is the&#13;
only effort to date to develop some measure of family planning program&#13;
strength. The ratings were collected before 1975, at a time when it was&#13;
thought that fertility had not declined in many of the countries where we&#13;
now know it has. The authors are deans in the field of population policy&#13;
and there is no question of their desire to be objective. See their&#13;
publication for further discussion of their index and of the alternative,&#13;
more objective, bases they sought but could not obtain.&#13;
2/   Liauldin and Berelson, Table 12, p. 110.&#13;
3/   lnstitutional capacity is represented by the secondary school enrollment&#13;
rate. The effec.t of family planning is significant at about a 10 percent&#13;
confidence level (t-statistic of 1.79).&#13;
4/   iviauldin, 1978, reports the range of available reasonable estimates&#13;
to be between 21 and 34 for 1975 (p. 77). He uses the rate of 26 per&#13;
thousand for 1975, and suggests a current rate of 18 to 20 (personal&#13;
correspondence).&#13;

well below rates in south Asia, Africa and most of Latin America. The decline&#13;
cannot be solely attributed to the government initiative in promulgating the&#13;
idea of family planning or providing the services; but the government itself&#13;
clearly believes its program effort can add to other incentives created for&#13;
couples to limit childbearing. In Indonesia, the birth rate had probably&#13;
declined to below 40 per thousand by 1976, from a high of about 47 in the&#13;
early 1960s. 1/ beginning in 1974, the existing government program changed&#13;
from a clinic-based approach, with about 3,000 clinics, to one based in&#13;
villages, with more than 40,000 village service points. In the three years&#13;
between 1973 and 1976, the percentage of married women who had ever used&#13;
contraception more than tripled in Java-Bali and in Central Java -- from&#13;
about 12.4 to 39 percent. 2/ One commentator has called family planning&#13;
Indonesia's most successful development program in terms of affecting the&#13;
lives of millions of village people. Given evidence that family planning&#13;
mothers' broups are taking on new functions such as nutrition, health and&#13;
crafts, he notes that family planning may turn out to be a leading means&#13;
of bringing about socioeconomic change. 3/&#13;
It is also notable that in a few other countries, rates of accep-&#13;
tance of contraception and concomitant declines in fertility have been rapid&#13;
even among the poor. Between 1965 and 1976 in Taiwan, the proportion of&#13;
illiterate wives of childbearing age ever using contraception rose from 19&#13;
to 78 percent. 4/ Fertility fell by 50 percent between 1961 and 1975; and&#13;
much of the decline occurred among the least-educated, as shown in Figure&#13;
IV-1. In Colombia, fertility rates of women with no education have also&#13;
fallen as rapidly as rates of those with more education (Figure IV-2) since&#13;
the late 1960s, when the government began supporting family planning.    In&#13;
Thailand, contraceptive use increased from 11 to 35 percent of rural married&#13;
women between 1968 and 1975, and from 33 to 49 percent of urban married&#13;
women; the government announced formal support of family planning in 1970;&#13;
and between 1972 and 1976 there were 2.5 million new acceptors. 5/&#13;
Of course, without systematic within-country studies in which&#13;
other changes are also controlled -- e.g. income growth among the least-&#13;
educated in Taiwan and Colombia -- family planning availability cannot be&#13;
assumed to have made the entire difference. Family planning programs in many&#13;
low-income countries -- Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and Ghana -- have not been&#13;

47 per thousand for 1960, 46 for 1965 and 40 for 1975. The World Bank&#13;

particularly effective. Insufficient support may be part of the reason; but&#13;
lack of effective demand for the means of fertility control has probably also&#13;
mattered.&#13;
Still the above evidence provides some hope that the circumstances&#13;
under which family planning can have some fertility-reducing effect may not be&#13;
so stringent as once believed; as noted in Part III, a reduction in costs of&#13;
avoiding children should make some difference at the margin.&#13;
In sum, family planning can interact with other development indica-&#13;
tors in bringing about a decline for two reasons. The first and now conven-&#13;
tional explanation is that presented in Part III above: with lower infant&#13;
mortality, more education and a greater share in income, the poor face in-&#13;
creasing costs of having children; availability of services lowers the cost&#13;
to them of meeting lower fertility goals. The second explanation is not&#13;
inconsistent with the first, but gives a greater independent role to family&#13;
planning: family planning not only facilitates achievement of lower fertil-&#13;
ity goals; it becomes the instrument by which the idea of lower fertility is&#13;
diffused. The notion that the idea of fertility limitation is important and&#13;
can affect fertility independently of social and economic change has been&#13;
proposed by students of Europe's demographic history. 1/ Studies of Europe s&#13;
19th century fertility decline indicate that declines there were not asso-&#13;
ciated in any consistent way with socioeconomic changes, but were related&#13;
across regions defined in terms of a common language and/or culture. 2/ Less&#13;
advanced areas began declines prior to more advanced areas; but regions of&#13;
similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds, despite different development&#13;
levels, moved together inma pattern of fertility decline.&#13;
It it'is the idea of fertility limitation that matters, then dif-&#13;
ferentials in fertility rates across countries and across households within&#13;
countries by income or education, should reflect primarily a difference in&#13;
the rate of innovative behavior among different income or education groups,&#13;
and should eventually narrow. This approach is consistent with the acceler-&#13;
ating pace of fertility decline described in Part I. Modern transportation&#13;
and communication networks leave few corners of the world untouched; the&#13;
transistor radio has brought to peasants in rural Asia not only new tastes&#13;
for consumer goods and new goals for educating their children, but the idea&#13;
of framily limitation.  And modern contraceptives have made it easier for&#13;
individuals to implement new fertility goals. It is plausible that when&#13;
governments actively support family planning, the idea (as well as the means)&#13;
of fertility control can spread more rapidly, reinforcing its acceptability&#13;
as well as lowering its costs.&#13;
1/   Knodel and Van de Walle, 1979.   In a similar vein, Caldwell (1976)&#13;
has argued that the western ideal of the nuclear family, and the&#13;
associated shift to child-centeredness, is the critical factor&#13;
in fertility decline.&#13;

The Case for Family Planning: A Consumption Good&#13;
It is a fundamental fact that preventing births imposes costs.&#13;
hodern contraceptives usually cost money; even if free they cost time; they&#13;
may be disagreeable to use; they may clash with religious principles; their&#13;
use may offend kin and friends. But in the absence of modern contraceptives,&#13;
the costs of preventing children are much higher -- sexual abstinence, with-&#13;
drawal, abortion, infanticide.&#13;
Making modern contraceptives available should thus, other things&#13;
being equal, cause people to have fewer children, except in those rare&#13;
circumstances (possibily extant in parts of Africa) where for a large&#13;
portion of couples, actual fertility falls short of desired fertility, due&#13;
to health-impaired fecundity. It will also make people better off in the&#13;
sense that they will have to incur lower costs of child prevention to&#13;
achieve any given number of children. Even those who decide to have the&#13;
same number of children will be better off, as contraception severs the&#13;
link between sexual activity and childbearing, and allows the arrival of&#13;
children to be timed more easily.&#13;
But as with education and general health services, the poor are&#13;
usually the least likely to benefit from access to contraceptives. In Tables&#13;
IV-2 and IV-3, countries for-which data were available on differences in&#13;
contraceptive use between rural and urban women, and among women by education,&#13;
are grouped in terms of their score on the family planning effort index&#13;
described above. Percentages of those women who want no more children and are&#13;
using modern contraceptives are shown. In general, countries with stronger&#13;
programs exhibit smaller differences in contraceptive use by residence and&#13;
education (as well as, for the most part higher overall rates within all&#13;
categories, but the higher total rates could be due to other differences&#13;
across countries, such as literacy and per capita income, which tend to be&#13;
correlated with the strength of family planning programs.) In Indonesia, with&#13;
a moderate program, 1/ rates of acceptance are actually slightly higher in&#13;
villages; in Pakistan and Bangladesh, with weak programs, rates of acceptance&#13;
are more than twice as high in urban compared to rural areas. Differences by&#13;
education also increase as program effort is weaker. The smaller differences&#13;
in countries with stronger programs suggest that poor, rural women in coun-&#13;
tries with weak programs have lower use because of lower access to services.&#13;
1/   Moderate in the early 1970s, when the index was developed.    The program&#13;
would probably now be rated as strong.&#13;

The figures in Table IV-3 also show that in all countries, among&#13;
women who state they want no more children, the less-educated are less&#13;
likely to be using modern means of fertility control. 1/ Though some of the&#13;
differences are surely due to differences in demand (even among women who&#13;
state they want no more children, the more-educated may feel more strongly&#13;
about avoiding future births), supply differences within countries probably&#13;
play some role. Where contraceptives are available only through the private&#13;
sector, the poor and less-educated face costs of controlling fertility which&#13;
may be a substantial proportion of their family income. When contraceptives,&#13;
abortion and sterilization are available only through doctors, the rural&#13;
poor are virtually excluded from access to the means of fertility control,&#13;
as doctors are heavily concentrated in cities. Even where family planning&#13;
programs are administered through health services, the rural poor are dis-&#13;
advantaged, as health services are better in urban areas. The disadvantage of&#13;
the poor in countries where family planning is not subsidized or administered&#13;
by government is underlined by evidence that in Taiwan, the program effort had&#13;
a stronger impact on fertility in the less modern areas, where preprogram&#13;
fertility was high and where unwanted fertility may have been greater. 2/&#13;
Indeed in Taiwan, with one of the oldest family planning programs, consider-&#13;
able differentials in birth rates by women's education virtually disappeared&#13;
betwen 1966 (soon after an intensive island-wide program was begun) and 1977,&#13;
as shown in Figure IV-1 above. In Colombia, though differentials in rates&#13;
have persisted over time, the rates of those with no education also fell&#13;
rapidly, as shown in Figure IV-2 above, at the time of the spread of family&#13;
planning services.&#13;
In most countries, the poor and the least-educated desire larger&#13;
families than those who are better-off. But there is considerable, if&#13;
scattered and circumstantial evidence, of unwanted fertility among the poor.&#13;
The response within categories of uneducated women in Taiwan and Colombia,&#13;
once the means of fertility limitation became less costly, is notable even&#13;
given that over time in those countries incomes were also increasing and&#13;
other social changes taking place. high rates of hospitalization due *to&#13;
illegal abortions were a major cause of interest in and support by the&#13;
medical community of family planning in.Colombia; today in Peru, where&#13;
government hospital programs in family planning have been for the most part&#13;
suspenaed, one of five women in Lima's Maternity Hospital is there due to&#13;
complications following illegal abortion. 3/ It is likely that some propor-&#13;
tion of all abortions are sought by poor women, and that the poor are most&#13;
likely to suffer from complications due to unsafe illegal abortions. The&#13;
case for the public provision of family planning services, and ensuring the&#13;
access to these of the poor, ought no longer to be controversial.&#13;
1/   The revealed-preference argument would be that on average the least-&#13;
educated care less about avoiding unwanted children, and therefore&#13;
are less likely to use contraception. The truth may lie between what&#13;
behavior and stated attitude imply.&#13;

V. Future Population Growth&#13;
The World bank has developed a set of projections of world popu-&#13;
lation by country; these projections are summarized in Table 17 of the World&#13;
Development Indicators. 1/ There the projected population in the year 2000&#13;
is shown by country along with the assumed year in which fertility will reach&#13;
replacement level, and for each country, the year in which the population will&#13;
stop growing. In this section we describe the assumptions which underlie the&#13;
projections, and their implications in terms of future population growth. For&#13;
selected countries, we present alternative projections and explain what changes&#13;
in the assumptions underlie the alternatives.&#13;
These projections and the alternatives should be viewed as illustra-&#13;
tions of what could happen, not as predictions. There are two conceptually&#13;
distinct sources of uncertainty regarding future population growth and size.&#13;
One is common to all predictions of future human behavior. Though the&#13;
accumulation of evidence from careful studies makes us reasonably certain&#13;
of the direction of change in fertility and mortality, given certain other&#13;
changes -- we can be less sure about the magnitude of change; over time,&#13;
shifts may occur in the relative importance of one or another factor, and&#13;
in the strength of the relationship between a factor and individual behavior.&#13;
The second source of uncertainty is more vexing, but a source of optimism&#13;
as well. The factors which affect fertility are not changing at an immutable&#13;
rate; governments can take conscious steps to increase more rapidly educa-&#13;
tional opportunities; to publicly support a change in the status of women;&#13;
to step up the pace at which health and family planning services are provided.&#13;
Unpredicted changes in policy may cause unpredicted demographic change.&#13;
The Assumptions Behind the Projections&#13;
These projections are based on a simple assumption about the&#13;
future, namely that current rates of social and economic progress, in-&#13;
cluding the spread of family planning and of other health and education&#13;
services, will continue.    On that basis, a set of stylized assumptions&#13;
regarding patterns of demographic change is applied across all countries;&#13;
these are explained in the Technical Notes accompanying the World Development&#13;
Indicators. In any country -- not just those for which we present specific&#13;
alternative projections -- a major departure from expected rates of progress&#13;
would probably alter the rates of decline in fertility and mortality. For&#13;
example, slower income growth or slower progress in education would lower&#13;
the rates of decline; initiation of a major effort in family planning where&#13;
it has not yet occurred would increase the rates of decline.&#13;
It is notable that for every country, some future decline in both&#13;
fertility and mortality is assumed. There are several reasons:&#13;
(1) The experience of the West and of an increasing number&#13;
of developing countries is that reductions in mortality&#13;
are eventually followed by reductions in fertility.&#13;
1/   Annex to the World Bank 1980 World Development Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
Some reduction in mortality has already occurred every-&#13;
where; that fertility will follow is consistent with&#13;
classical demographic transition theory.&#13;
(2) Moreover, across countries and within countries, as&#13;
discussed in preceding sections, demographic rates are&#13;
generally lower the higher the level of socioeconomic&#13;
development. The projections assume that these cross-&#13;
section differences will apply over time; they assume&#13;
that the pace of income growth and of socioeconomic&#13;
change, already captured in current demographic rates&#13;
across countries, will continue at similar rates within&#13;
countries and will continue to affect in the same way&#13;
future demographic rates. Put another way, the future&#13;
rates of decline in both mortality and fertility are&#13;
in part a function of current levels.&#13;
(3) At the same time, as we have discussed above, the pace&#13;
of declLnes in fertility has quickened. The projec-&#13;
tions thierefore do not exclude the possibility of a&#13;
shift downward in the relationship between education,&#13;
urbanization and other development indicators, and&#13;
fertility. For example, Indonesia is projected to&#13;
have achieved a crude birth rate of 25 per thousand by&#13;
the year 2000, below Costa Rica's current rate of 28&#13;
per thousand. But to "match" Costa Rica's current&#13;
profile in other respects, Indonesia would have to in-&#13;
crease per capita income from $300 to over $1,000, in-&#13;
crease life expectancy from 48 to 70, and increase the&#13;
adult literacy rate from 62 to almost 90 percent -- all&#13;
in a 20-year period during which its population will&#13;
increase by 50 percent, from 140 to over 200 million.&#13;
Two mechanisms build in this downward shift. One is&#13;
that future country rates are based partly on recent&#13;
rates; in some countries, including Indonesia, recent&#13;
rates are lower than cross-section multivariate analyses&#13;
of fertility determinants alone would indicate. The&#13;
second is that family planning programs are expected to&#13;
have an additional effect in reducing fertility, partic-&#13;
ularly in countries like Mexico and Indonesia, where&#13;
major program efforts are recent and should have an impact&#13;
in the next several decades.&#13;
The projections, in short, assume that economic growth and social&#13;
progress will continue at the historical pace, reducing fertility and mortal-&#13;
ity; that fertility will decline somewhat more rapidly in response to these&#13;
changes than it did in the past; and that family planning programs will affect&#13;
the pace of declines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
In an interesting sense, the projections are more fragile for&#13;
countries where differentials in fertility between the poor and those better-&#13;
off are substantial and where the poor constitute a large enough portion of&#13;
the population so that their high fertility has a significant impact on&#13;
average countiLywide rates. This is the case in several Latin American&#13;
countries, including Brazil and Mexico. On the one hand, there is room for&#13;
continuation of current declines in such countries via a transfer of an in-&#13;
creasing portion of the decline to the less-privileged groups with current&#13;
high rates. Countries such as these could perhaps exceed the average&#13;
fertility declines projected, if special efforts were made to improve&#13;
services received by the poor. On the other hand, a decline following this&#13;
pattern depends crucially on the assumption that the living standards of&#13;
today's poor will improve. Ironically, assuring that education and health&#13;
and family planning services reach the poor in these countries is made all&#13;
the more difficult by their current higher household dependency ratios, as&#13;
discussed in Part II above.&#13;
The projections for sub-Saharan African countries and for other&#13;
countries where to date there has been no fertility decline at all (Bangladesh,&#13;
Nepal) also merit a special caveat. The beginning of decline is imposed in&#13;
the African country projections in 1985, in part because advances in educa-&#13;
tion and income should by then begin to have an effect, but in part also&#13;
because continuing diffusion of lower fertility norms throughout the world&#13;
and concomitant increases in use of family planning are assumed. But insofar&#13;
as there are special cultural barriers to lower fertility -- only poorly&#13;
understood -- or social restrictions on women which insure large families --&#13;
better understood but in the short run unlikely to change -- the expectation&#13;
that fertility will soon turn downward aay be unwarranted. (In general, re-&#13;
gression analysis does not indicate that fertility is higher in African coun-&#13;
tries or in the poor Islamic countries of South Asia, than levels of socio-&#13;
economic development would predict; 1/ the real question is whether the&#13;
cross-section analyses provide a good guide to what changes might be expected&#13;
within those countries in the future.)&#13;
Some Implications&#13;
By the year 2000, world population will have grown from the current&#13;
estimated 4.1 billion to 6 billion; the population of the developing coun-&#13;
tries will increase from 3 to 4.1 billion. Overall population growth rates&#13;
should slow from 1.71 currently to about 1.36 in the year 2000, and the&#13;
rate for the developing countries should have slowed from 2.12 to 1.62.&#13;
1/   In bell's analysis (1976), these countries do not have unusually large&#13;
residuals (based on computer printouts); see also Mauldin and Berelson,&#13;
1978, Table 14. Chao (1979), reports that mortality is higher in Africa&#13;
than socioeconomic factors would suggest, due to malaria epidemics, the&#13;
hazardous environment, and the greater difficulty of providing health&#13;
services to the dispersed population (p. 19).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
however, the absolute annual increases in population size will grow, from&#13;
about 70 million in 1980 to 82 million in the year 2000 for the world as a&#13;
whole, and from 64 to 76 million in developing countries, as lower growth&#13;
rates apply to ever-burgeoning numbers. 1/ Even given the fertility declines&#13;
projected, India will grow from 670 to 970 million people; Brazil from 125 to&#13;
200 million; and Nigeria from 88 to 153 million.&#13;
Replacement-level fertility for the world as a whole is projected&#13;
to occur in about 2020 and a stationary population of about 9.8 billion to&#13;
be reached in 2090. Table V-1 shows for selected countries the year in which&#13;
replacement-level fertility should be reached, the resulting year when popula-&#13;
tion growth will cease, and the hypothetical size of the population in that&#13;
year.&#13;
To illustrate the effects of different rates of fertility decline,&#13;
rates of growth and changes in size of the school-age and working-age popula-&#13;
tions between 1975 and 2000 are shown for selected countries in Tables V-2&#13;
and V-3.   The countries are arranged in descending order by current crude&#13;
birth rates.&#13;
In Nigeria, where by assumption fertility decline begins only&#13;
in 1985 and proceeds slowly, the size of both groups should almost double&#13;
in the next 20 years. In Mexico, the working-age group will double in size,&#13;
due to past high fertility, but the ongoing fertility decline will noticeably&#13;
slow the growth of the school-age group; the growth rate for that group will&#13;
drop from 3 to 1 percent and its size will increase by about 60 percent. The&#13;
dependency burden will decline slightly; if per capita income growth is sus-&#13;
tained and the same proportion of GNP is allocated to primary schooling, the&#13;
country should be able to extend education to a higher proportion of children,&#13;
bringing into the system those who are least likely to attend now.&#13;
In Colombia, where fertility decline began in the mid-1960s, the&#13;
school-age population is essentially stable (although a slight bulge after&#13;
1985 will occur as the children of the large cohorts born in the 1960s pass&#13;
through school). The working-age group will grow at rates well below those&#13;
in Nigeria and Mexico, but will still increase rapidly. Not evident in the&#13;
overall figures is the reduction in the proportion of young, inexperienced&#13;
workers which will need to be absorbed each year. Between 1980 and 1990, the&#13;
share of 15 to 24 year olds in the total working-age population will drop&#13;
from 37 to 29 percent. As young persons are the most difficult to absorb&#13;
into the labor force and have the highest rates of unemployment, a continua-&#13;
tion of current rates of economic growth would assure continued declines in&#13;
unemployment rates, and would eventually put more pressure on wages. And as&#13;
the proportion of inexperienced workers to all workers declines, an increase&#13;
in average productivity of the labor force is possible. Moreover, for those&#13;
1/   These figures are based on 1979 World Bank projections.&#13;

workers entering the labor force in smaller cohorts, the result may be incomes&#13;
over their lifetimes which are higher than their parents' current incomes. 1/&#13;
I&#13;
In Korea, where fertility decline began slightly earlier than in&#13;
Colombia, and was in the 1960s more rapid, the school-age population has&#13;
stabilized, and the growth of the working-age population will have slowed&#13;
to 1.24 percent by the end of the century, well below the 2 and 3 percent&#13;
growth rates of most developing countries. In the U.S., the school-age&#13;
population will decline, and the working-age population will grow at less&#13;
than one percent; given similar rates of savings and investment, proportion-&#13;
ately more resources can'be allocated to increasing spending per school-age&#13;
child and increasing the productivity of workers. 2/&#13;
Some Alternative Projections&#13;
Brazil, Mexico and Colombia are similar in many respects, as shown&#13;
in Table V-4. All have literacy rates above 75 percent, life expectancy above&#13;
62, per-capita income in the middle-income range and urbanization rates of&#13;
about 60 percent. Where they differ most is in the amount of recent fertility&#13;
decline; Colombia has had the most decline and has now the lowest fertility.&#13;
Family planning clinics were first opened in Colombia in the mid&#13;
to late 1960s, under the sponsorship of local private organizations. The&#13;
government added its support several years later, through the Mlinistry of&#13;
riealth. The projections of future population growth and size in Colombia&#13;
are based on the assumption that the crude birth rate will fall to below&#13;
18 by 2005, when replacement level fertility will occur. This relatively&#13;
early date for replacement fertility is based on Colombia's low current&#13;
rate and the growing acceptance of family planning; whether early supply of&#13;
family planning services in Colombia was a response to demand or independent&#13;
of it, the two are expected to interact in the future to reduce fertility&#13;
further.&#13;
Mexico moved during the 1970s from a pro-natalist stance to vigorous&#13;
support of family planning, doing so five to eight years later than Colombia.&#13;
Mexico's current crude birth rate is about 35 per thousand, and it is pro-&#13;
jected to reach replacement-level fertility 10 years later than Colombia in&#13;
2015. The Brazilian government does not consider population growth to be a&#13;
problem, though the government permits family planning for health purposes.&#13;
Brazil's current crude birth rate, like Mexico's, is about 35 per thousand,&#13;
and it is also projected to reach replacement level fertility by the year&#13;
2015.&#13;

of children in the U.S. have been associated with decreases in per-child&#13;
spending.&#13;

how would the demographic future of Brazil and Mexico differ if&#13;
they could match Colombia's projected record, and reach replacement level&#13;
fertility a decade earlier,'in 2005 (in Mexico, for example, if current&#13;
support of family planning could be matched by a crash literacy program;&#13;
in Brazil if vigorous support of family planning to reach the poor were&#13;
initiated and had some impact)?&#13;
For Brazil and Mexico to reach replacement-level fertility earlier&#13;
would not require fertility declines in the immediate future which are&#13;
unprecendented. For both countries, the alternative projections imply about a&#13;
40 percent decline in the crude birth rate, from about 35 now to just below 20&#13;
in the year 2000; this is less than the one point a year off their crude birth&#13;
rates achieved in the previous two decades by Taiwan and Korea. Figure V-1&#13;
illustrates the current rates for Colombia and Brazil, and an alternative&#13;
lower rate for Brazil. The resultant sizes of Brazil's future school-age,&#13;
working-age and total populations, given the alternative rates of fertility&#13;
decline, are shown in Figure V-2. In the short term, the difference is most&#13;
evident in the younger age group; in Brazil that group would increase by 5&#13;
rather than 13 million (in Mexico by 1-1/2 rather than 5-1/2 million). By&#13;
the year 2020, the result is evident in the difference in working-age popula-&#13;
tion size; that group would be 10 percent smaller in both countries, being&#13;
163 rather than 182 million in Brazil, and about 90 rather than 100 million&#13;
in Mexico. Even so in both countries, the increase in the size of this group&#13;
will exceed the absolute size of the group today.&#13;
In Brazil,'moving up the year of replacement level fertility by&#13;
10 years implies an ultimate population size which is about 290 million&#13;
rather than 350 million; in Miexico, the population stabilizes at 170 rather&#13;
than 205 million. Even with the increased rate of fertility decline, the&#13;
population of each country would ultimately be more than twice its current&#13;
size.&#13;

A Concluding Remark&#13;
There are many reasons to expect poverty and rapid population&#13;
growth to be mutually reinforcing; these I have tried to outline above.&#13;
Regarding some of the links, there is substantial evidence; regarding others,&#13;
much less. The issue is not a simple one; indeed if it were there would be no&#13;
issue at all.&#13;
So the search for better understanding goes on; in scientific work&#13;
the search is for systematic regularities and the framing and testing of&#13;
refutable hypotheses regarding those regularities. This "science" of eco-&#13;
nomic demography is impersonal -- concerned, as is evident above, with large&#13;
numbers, generalizable phenomena, statistical regularities, and theories to&#13;
explain it all. But policies, or nonpolicies, developed and justified on the&#13;
basis of such science, concern peculiarly personal subjects -- the family,&#13;
human reproduction, relations between the young and old, between men and&#13;
women. Those who bring science to these personal realms tread a peculiar&#13;
path, one where scientific objectivity is more elusive than ever. But the&#13;
path is one which commands our attention; population and poverty are not&#13;
subjects to be ignored. With that in mind the above was written.&#13;

Appendix B&#13;
The Cross-Country Relation Between&#13;
Per-Capita Income and Fertility/Mortality&#13;
Figures I-3 and I-4&#13;
The figures are based on the results of estimating equations in&#13;
which the demographic rates of developing countries are regressed on their&#13;
per-capita incomes, using World Bank data for the year 1977.&#13;
Figure I-3A&#13;
The equation and estimates for Figure I-3A, using data for 88&#13;
developing countries, are:&#13;
2        2&#13;
TFR = 6.72 - .00234Y + .000000377Y         R  = .46&#13;
(8.53)        (7.69)        N   =  88&#13;
where TFR is total fertility rate&#13;
Y is income per capita&#13;
Y is income per capita squared.&#13;
The mean total fertility rate in the sample is 5.40.&#13;
In parentheses under the estimated coefficients are t-statistics.&#13;
The squared income term allows for the U-shaped effect. Libya&#13;
and Saudi Arabia are shown; their high income and high fertility pull the&#13;
estimated line up on the right side of the figure.&#13;
Figure I-3b&#13;
For Figure I-3b, 5 countries with very high income due to oil&#13;
exports were eliminated: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.&#13;
The resulting estimates are:&#13;
2        2&#13;
TFR = 6.78 - .00246Y + .000000329Y         R  = .55&#13;
(4.72)        (1.80)         N  = 83&#13;
The mean total fertility rate in this sample is 5.33.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
Figure I-4&#13;
The equation and estimates for Figure I-4 are:&#13;
2&#13;
LE = 11.2 + 7.06 LY       R  = .54&#13;
(10.1)        N   =  88&#13;
where LE is life expectancy&#13;
LY is the natural log of income per capita.&#13;
£iean life expectancy in the sample is 55.3.&#13;
Specifying the income term in logarithmic form allows for&#13;
diminishing returns, in terms of life expectancy, to higher income.&#13;
In all three figures, the countries named are those for which the&#13;
actual value of the total fertility rate or of life expectancy was more than&#13;
one standard deviation away from the value derived from the estimates. The&#13;
distance of a country from the estimated lines in the figures indicates to&#13;
what extent its actual rate deviates from its "expected" rate.&#13;

            Population and poverty in the developing world
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The association between poverty and
            rapid population growth in developing countries is examined.
            Analysis of current demographic data revealed a shift in the
            association between low income and high fertility and
            mortality rates. It is noted that the effects of rapid
            population growth upon the poor operate at the national
            level by influencing factor and product prices and the per
            capita availability of investment resources. Theories of the
            relation between family size and family members' health
            and educational and income status are reviewed. Population
            policy is assessed emphasizing the importance of the
            delivery of family planning services to the poor.
            Illustrative projections of population growth into the 21st
            century are based on a set of assumptions regarding the
            future course of growth and poverty alleviation and the
            future family planning policies of developing countries.
