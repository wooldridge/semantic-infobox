        <abstracts>
            As governments struggle with rising
            health care costs, public-private partnerships in
            constructing and managing public hospitals can provide
            innovative ways to control costs and improve service.
            Experience shows that such partnerships offer significant
            benefits as long as policymakers structure the transactions
            carefully and create sound regulatory arrangements to ensure
            universal access, quality care, and improvements in efficiency.
