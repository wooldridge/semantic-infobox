Harnessing Market Power&#13;

&#13;
Making Sanitation Attractive and Accessible for the Rural Poor&#13;
In two Vietnam provinces, an international NGO developed a range of low-cost sanitation options and&#13;
&#13;
stimulated a network of local masons to market and deliver them to the rural population. As a result, the&#13;
&#13;
sanitation access rate increased markedly in the area, even among the poor. This Field Note outlines lessons&#13;
&#13;
learned in the process of creating the demand for sanitation and meeting this demand locally.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Subsidy-based, supply-driven intervensions have been painfully slow in&#13;
     bringing sustainable sanitation in developing countries, especially among the&#13;
     rural poor.&#13;

     In 2003, the international NGO International Development Enterprises&#13;

    Use of external subsidies for business development and promotion is often&#13;
    more sustainable than subsidizing sanitation hardware, because once demand&#13;

  eight children aged 3 to 29 years, three work in Saigon. Before the IDE project,        Market Developments Resulting&#13;
&#13;
  Sang and his wife farmed, and he made cement rings for dug wells. With many             from Linking Market Players are&#13;

  children to feed and farming land that was sandy and barren, combating hunger           Benefiting All Stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
  was a perennial struggle. Then the market changed. People stopped buying well&#13;
  rings as drilled wells became available. Sang migrated to find wage work like           Linkages among players in the supply&#13;
&#13;
  cutting forest wood and mining sand from riverbeds and beaches. However,                chain have improved the flow of market&#13;

  wage work was seasonal and failed to provide sustenance for his family.                 information, which is bringing in&#13;

&#13;
  Since he was known as a former ring maker, IDE's sanitation project invited him         stakeholders. Examples in the project&#13;
&#13;
  to attend a workshop on how to build hygienic latrines. Sang learned about              areas include customer referrals.&#13;

  building rings for low-cost semi-septic tanks, a technology that his fellow villagers   Cement shops provide customers with&#13;
&#13;
  preferred. Sang now felt confident enough to start his own business making such         referrals to specific village masons,&#13;
&#13;
  rings. He registered with the local network of masons started by IDE and                who refer business to the same shops.&#13;
&#13;
  advertised his availability.                                                            This has enabled one-stop shopping by&#13;

&#13;
  Sang faced initial difficulties in building name recognition and reputation among       the mason who will take on design,&#13;
&#13;
  his potential customers. He sold only 3 sets of rings per month (a semi-septic          procurement, and building tasks.&#13;
&#13;
  tank needs 1 set of 6 rings), earning approximately VND270,000 (US$18) in profits.      Cement often serves as working capital&#13;
                                                                                          since it represents approximately 60&#13;
&#13;
  Sang then decided to attend the promotion meetings organized by the Vietnam             percent of the entire direct cost of a&#13;
&#13;
  Women's Union, where he found people very interested in discussing hygiene              latrine. The mason contracted to build the&#13;

  and environmental sanitation matters. Moreover, the commune health workers              latrine for a household may also refer the&#13;
&#13;
  treated IDE's network of trained masons with respect and recommended him to             customer to another mason who&#13;
&#13;
  the villagers. After these meetings, people came to him with orders directly or         specializes in making cement rings.&#13;

&#13;
  In June 2004, IDE and the local government organized another workshop in Binh Sa        These relationships have improved the&#13;
&#13;
  commune for upgrading latrine-building techniques. After that, Sang started making      mason's capacity to respond promptly&#13;
&#13;
  and selling the rings from his home, which enabled him to produce more. He also         to customer demand, and due to&#13;
&#13;
  worked out new payment terms with the retailers of construction materials. By getting   competition among masons, also&#13;
&#13;
  50 percent of the cement on credit, he was able to extend credit to his customers.      generated cost reductions for the&#13;
                                                                                          customer. Service providers in the project&#13;

invites the mason to the construction site&#13;
and requests his technical opinion. The&#13;
mason in turn designs the facility,&#13;
purchases all the necessary direct inputs&#13;
for building the latrine, and builds it before&#13;
asking for payment. Another common&#13;
approach is for householders to buy the&#13;
construction inputs or pay an advance for&#13;
the materials to the mason. This injects&#13;
working capital into the value chain.&#13;

            Private sector sanitation delivery in
            Vietnam: harnessing market power for rural sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In two Vietnam provinces, an
            international NGO developed a range of low-cost sanitation
            options and stimulated a network of local masons to market
            and deliver them to the rural population. As a result, the
            sanitation access rate increased markedly in the area, even
            among the poor. This Field Note outlines lessons learned in
            the process of creating the demand for sanitation and
            meeting this demand locally.
