MATERNAL HEALTH AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:                    Republic of Paraguay&#13;
Implementing Agency:         Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS)&#13;
Poverty:                     Program of Targeted Interventions. The operation targets the poor&#13;
by providing primary health care and by serving areas of the country&#13;
in which the incidence of poverty is high.&#13;
Amount:                      US$21.8 million equivalent.&#13;
Terms:                       One loan for US$10.9 million on Currency Pool Loan (CPL) terms&#13;
and the other for US$10.9 milllion on fixed-rate US-Dollar-based&#13;
Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms. Both loans would be disbursed&#13;
at equal rates over the expected disbursement period of six years.&#13;
The SCL would be repayable in 15 years; each semester's aggregate&#13;
disbursements (Disbursed Amount) would have a grace period of&#13;
three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate fixing date&#13;
of that Disbursed Amount. The CPL would have a grace period of&#13;
five years, a final maturity of 17 years and level repayment of&#13;
principal.&#13;
Commitment Fee:              0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,&#13;
less any waiver.&#13;
Financing Plan:              See para. 7.6.&#13;
Net Present Value:           Not applicable&#13;
Financial Benefits           The Borrower has selected both a US-Dollar SCL and a CPL in&#13;
and Risks:                   order to improve the management of its external liabilities and reduce&#13;
risks. The combination of Dollar-based SCL and CPL terms reduces&#13;
the risk from the non-US-Dollar components of the CPL. The&#13;
choice of having the bulk of financing in US Dollars reflects the&#13;
importance of US-Dollar based contracts in Paraguay's international&#13;
trade and Treasury receipts. The Government has selected a fixed-&#13;
rate SCL to ensure stability of debt-service payments.&#13;

1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. RECENT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
1.1   Background. Emerging from 35 years of dictatorship, Paraguay has undergone&#13;
numerous political and economic changes in its transition to democracy. While the legacy&#13;
of close to four decades of dictatorial rule is still visible, Paraguay has made important&#13;
strides in its quest to become a modern, democratic state. Despite poor macroeconomic&#13;
management in the 1 980s, extreme poverty continues to be lower than in many countries&#13;
with higher per capita incomes, because income distribution is more equitable than the&#13;
average for Latin America. Moreover, the new Government has made substantial&#13;
improvements in macroeconomic management, reducing inflation and public external debt,&#13;
and increasing foreign reserves. However, despite these improvements, the average&#13;
annual growth recorded for the 1992-1995 was less than 3.0 percent, the same as the rate&#13;
of population growth. Stagnating and sometimes declining per capita income threatens&#13;
the economic well-being attained thus far, and is already resulting in reduced access for&#13;
social services to the poor, especially in rural areas. A strengthening of health services to&#13;
underserved populations is central to improving welfare, ensuring more productive and&#13;
healthy lives and reduced population growth.&#13;
1.2   Economic Policy. The Government of Paraguay seeks to create an environment&#13;
for sustained private sector-led growth. To improve the climate for long-term investment&#13;
the Government seeks to strengthen financial intermediation, restructure and privatize&#13;
public sector enterprises, improve transportation infrastructure, and modernize the legal&#13;
and institutional environment. For the public sector, this means divesting itself of&#13;
responsibilities more appropriate for the private sector, containing the expansion of public&#13;
sector expenditures, and improving the management capacity of its institutions in areas&#13;
where it is to play a supportive role, such as agricultural services, infrastructure and&#13;
human resource development, enabling Paraguay to remain competitive in MERCOSUR&#13;
and the broader external economy. In human resource development and agriculture, it&#13;
seeks to strengthen service delivery capability, leading to improvements in the quantity and&#13;
quality of services provided.&#13;
1.3   Some steps have been taken along these lines, not all of them with the intended&#13;
consequences. To reduce the public deficit and improve efficiency, the Government is&#13;
promoting the privatization of some public sector enterprises, where appropriate. It is&#13;
also taking the necessary steps to decentralize some public services, namely health and&#13;
education, to the municipalities and departments. And, it has increased social spending.&#13;
1.4   The decentralization of government services began in 1989 with the transfer of&#13;
political power to municipal governments. Although prior to that time municipal&#13;
governments and councils were elected, mayors were appointed by the central&#13;
government. Since 1991, mayors have become elected officials. The 1992 Constitution&#13;
(Article 168) broadens municipal responsibilities to include urban planning, environment,&#13;
markets, tourism, health, police, traffic management and the supervision of public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
transportation. To enable them to fulfill their new role, Article 169 transfers the property&#13;
tax previously collected by the central govemment to the municipalities. Municipalities&#13;
are allowed to retain 70 percent of revenues which altogether amount to less than 5&#13;
percent of the central Government budget. There are no transfers from higher&#13;
governmental levels to municipalities. Departments receive 15 percent of the property tax&#13;
collected by municipalities, a 15-percent share of the value-added tax from the central&#13;
Government, and a 30-percent share of gambling income. Departmental revenues amount&#13;
to less than one percent of the central Govemment budget. Thus, the amount of resources&#13;
transferred has been minimal. Because the operational arrangements to implement the&#13;
new legal framework have not been specified, the assignment of responsibilities across the&#13;
three levels of government is unclear, leading to a lack of accountability, duplication of&#13;
some functions and absence of others. The assignment of responsibilities across the three&#13;
levels of govemment has not been specified, leading to a lack of accountability,&#13;
duplication of some functions and absence of others. Moreover, municipalities and&#13;
departments lack the capability to manage their new responsibilities.&#13;
1.5    The Government has also increased expenditures in the social sectors. Although&#13;
social spending has been historically low in Paraguay, the Government increased public&#13;
health expenditures from 1.0 to 2.5 percent of GDP from 1989 to 1994. However, most&#13;
of the increase was absorbed by an increase in public wages and to a lesser extent on&#13;
capital expenditures. Both of these increased at the expense of materials and supplies.&#13;
Thus, increased spending did not lead to needed improvements in quantity and quality of&#13;
services provided.&#13;
B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXPENDITURES&#13;
1.6   Paraguay has low levels of poverty relative to other countries in the region. The&#13;
highest poverty levels are found in the northeastem departments, and some of the&#13;
peripheral areas surrounding Asunci6n (see Table 1). These include the most rural&#13;
departments and represent some of the areas where the Government has invested the least&#13;
in basic services. Due to years of underinvestment in such services, only one-fifth of all&#13;
rural dwellings have running water, and 16 percent have sanitation. Paved roads are&#13;
scarce and less than forty percent of households have electricity. Health resources are also&#13;
more scarce in the North. These departments contain most of Paraguay's indigenous&#13;
population and many of the new settlements of rural migrants.&#13;
1.7   Social Policy. The Constitution assigns the Govemment the responsibility for the&#13;
provision of social services to lower income groups. In the case of education, the&#13;
Constitution specifies the proportion of the budget to be earmarked for education. It does&#13;
not do so for health. But the Govemment's commitment to strengthen health services is&#13;
evident from the numerous health projects currently under preparation and implementation&#13;
with the financial assistance of KMl, JICA, UNFPA, USAID, the Spanish Government,&#13;
the IDB and the Bank (Asunci6n Sewerage Project, Ln. 3842-PA; and Third Water&#13;
Supply Project Ln, 3519-PA).&#13;

' Those extremely poor are also included among the poor.&#13;
The DHS included part of the Central dept. in the same category as the Southem region and part with&#13;
the Greater Asuncion Area. Measures of poverty in each survey differ. The IES indicator is based on&#13;
income, and the DHS indicator is based on an index of unsatisfied basic needs.&#13;
Source: World Bank Report No. 12293-PA and Special Tabulations.&#13;
1 .8    Despite the fact that poverty is concentrated in specific geographical areas, and can&#13;
therefore be easily targeted, few social programs target the poor, and those that do are&#13;
generally limited in scope. Existing social programs tend to be poorly managed and rarely&#13;
employ systematic targeting mechanisms. In the case of health care, resources are&#13;
concentrated in urban areas, primarily Asunci6n, where a small proportion of Paraguay's&#13;
poor are located', and program priorities have been on curative, hospital-based care.&#13;
Some efforts are being made to reverse this historical bias by increasing the coverage of&#13;
preventive care and giving a greater role to secondary and primary levels of care. The&#13;
proposed project would reverse this bias in six of the poorest departments.&#13;
2. OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
A. HEALTH STATUS&#13;
2.1     Overall Health Profile. Paraguay's cause of death structure characterizes it as&#13;
being in a mid-epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious diseases and&#13;
chronic/degenerative diseases among the top five killers. Despite the low overall&#13;
investment in health, Paraguayans have a relatively favorable health profile. Life&#13;
expectancy at birth is equal to the regional average and infant mortality is slightly lower&#13;
than the regional average. Nutritional status is one of the best in the region (see Annex 1,&#13;
Table 1). The major exceptions to this benign pattem are Paraguay's high maternal and&#13;
Poverty estimates between the two surveys are not comparable. The IES survey employs income to&#13;
measure poverty, and the ENDS employs a basic needs scale. Although the former is a more&#13;
appropriate measure of poverty the survey only covers urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
perinatal mortality rates. Paraguay's maternal mortality is surpassed only by that of Bolivia.&#13;
National health indices do mask some important regional variations. In the northem and&#13;
eastern departments, where investment in social services has been historically deficient, official&#13;
matemal mortality rates are as much as six times higher than in Asunci6n. Variations in infant&#13;
and child mortality are similar, with rates being two to three times higher in departments such&#13;
as Alto Parana, Alto Paraguay and Amambay than in Asunci6n (see Annex 1, Tables 2A and&#13;
2B).&#13;
2.2    Maternal Health. Ministry of Health statistics for 1991 report a maternal&#13;
mortality rate of 152 per 100,000 births. Ministry figures, however, provide only a partial&#13;
view of the problem as many cases are not reported because they occur in small private&#13;
clinics or simply because women never reach a health provider. Underreporting is greater&#13;
when maternal mortality is the result of an induced illegal abortion. Adjusting for&#13;
underregistration, studies have estimated maternal mortality to be as high as 386 per&#13;
100,000 births. The main causes of death are abortion (28 percent of all maternal deaths),&#13;
followed by toxemia (21 percent), hemorrhage (16 percent) and sepsis (11 percent).2&#13;
2.3    The high maternal mortality and morbidity rates are a direct result of insufficient&#13;
and poor quality prenatal and delivery care, and family planning services. Poorly&#13;
performed deliveries also account for an important share of infant deaths as birth lesions&#13;
are by far the main cause of death of children under one year of age. Only two-thirds of&#13;
all Paraguayan births are delivered by professional medical staff (physicians and nurse-&#13;
midwives). Close to half of all births are home births. Only countries with sizeable&#13;
indigenous populations such as Bolivia, Peruz and Guatemala have lower coverage.&#13;
Moreover, the coverage of institutional births has not improved in the last decade.3 In the&#13;
northem departments, the focus of this project, coverage of professionally attended&#13;
deliveries was only 42 percent in 1990, and close to three-quarters of deliveries were&#13;
home births. The poor and rural population rely heavily on the services of midwives.&#13;
Considering that access to safe water is minimal in poor rural households, home births are&#13;
likely to be more risky. Coverage of prenatal care by professional staff is also lower in the&#13;
North, where only 67 percent received prenatal care by trained personnel compared with&#13;
84 percent nationally (see Table 2).&#13;

3 A comparison of survey data from 1979 and 1990 showed no improvement in the coverage of&#13;
professionally attended births in the ten-year period. (1990 survey results come from the ENDS.&#13;
The survey classifies the Paraguayan territory into four regions as follows: Asunci6n includes the&#13;
Greater Metropolitan Area of Asunci6n, i.e., part of the Central Department; North includes&#13;
Concepci6n, San Pedro and Amambay; Center-South includes Cordillera, Guaira, Caazapa,&#13;
Misiones, Paraguari, Neembucui and the remainder of Central; and East includes Alto Parana,&#13;
Caaguazui, Itapiia and Canindeyu6.&#13;

2.4    Inadequate access to modern4 contraceptive services and information accounts for&#13;
the high proportion of women of high reproductive risk (women bearing children when&#13;
they are too young, too old, of high parity or within short birth intervals) and a high level&#13;
of unwanted fertility (as evidenced by the high number of induced abortions). One-third of&#13;
women giving birth in Paraguay can be classified as being of high reproductive risk.&#13;
Complications during pregnancy and delivery are more common among women in the&#13;
high risk category. Fertility is high, at 4.7 births per woman and is highest in northern&#13;
Paraguay at 6.7 births per woman. Fertility increases with poverty, with the poor having&#13;
as many as two more children than the average woman. Adolescent fertility is also high,&#13;
with 17 percent of women under 20 years of age having had at least one birth. In the&#13;
North, one-quarter of all girls under 20 have had at least one birth. Births are also closely&#13;
spaced, particularly among younger women. Two-thirds of all adolescent mothers (aged&#13;
15-19) and one quarter of mothers aged 20-29 had birth intervals that fell short of the&#13;
recommended minimum of 24 months. In the Northern departments, as many as 42&#13;
percent of women's most recent birth followed a birth interval of less than 24 months (see&#13;
Table 3).&#13;
2.5    Use of contraception' varies by region and age, with only 24 percent of women&#13;
using modern contraception in northern departments compared with 35 percent for&#13;
Paraguay as a whole. Among women under 20 years of age, only 5 percent use&#13;
contraception. Given that 35 percent of women report having had sexual relations by age&#13;
18, contraceptive use among women in this age group is low. Inadequate access to&#13;
contraception results in high rates of unwanted pregnancies and births. Unwanted&#13;
4 Modern contraception includes any of the following methods: hormonal methods (orals, injections, or&#13;
implants), intra-uterine devices, male and female sterilization, and barrier methods (condoms,&#13;
foams, diaphragms, etc.).&#13;
5The use of modern contraception has almost doubled since 1979, contributing to a reported 60 percent&#13;
decline in maternal mortality in the last 15 years. However, it has had a limited effect on fertility&#13;
rates because it has partially replaced abortion as a means of fertility regulation. The other reason&#13;
for the limited impact on fertility is that increases in contraceptive use have been greatest among&#13;
women aged 30-39 who have likely already had the children they want.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
pregnancies often result in induced abortions. Given that abortion is illegal, many are&#13;
performed in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. Thus, complications are common, leading&#13;
to high maternal morbidity and mortality rates.&#13;

2.6    Infant and Child Health. Infant and child mortality have declined by one-third&#13;
in the last 15 years, and are at the same level as the average for Latin America. However,&#13;
there are some important regional disparities. According to survey data from 1990,&#13;
Asuncion was estimated to have an infant mortality of 28 per 1000 live births. In the&#13;
northern and eastern regions of the country, rates were above 40 per 1000. Census&#13;
figures for  1992 estimate rates of 37 per 1000 in Asuncion and over 45 per 1000 for most&#13;
of the North.6&#13;
2.7    The main causes of infant deaths, i.e., birth lesions, tetanus and infections of the&#13;
newborn, can all be easily prevented with adequate prenatal and delivery care. These&#13;
causes account for one-third of all infant deaths (MSPBS, 1992). Infant mortality among&#13;
children born to mothers who received neither prenatal nor delivery care was 48 per 1000&#13;
live births, compared with 26 for children of women who received both (ENDS, 1991).&#13;
Among  children under 5 years of age, one quarter of all deaths are due to acute&#13;
respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea, both preventable with adequate treatment,&#13;
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water&#13;
and health education.&#13;
2.8     Nutritional statu is far abovte  t average for the region. In 1990, seven percent&#13;
of births in Paraguay were underweight, and only five percent of Paraguayan children&#13;
under five years of age are underweight for age.7 Both of these indices are among the&#13;
lowest in the region. Seventeen percent of all children under five showed signs of chronic&#13;
malnutrition (height-for-age). This figure is also low, compared with other countries in&#13;
Alto Paraguay is twice as high, with 92 infant deaths per 1000 live births.&#13;
Children scoring two standard deviations below the mean were considered undernourished. U.S.&#13;
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards were employed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
the region. In the North, one quarter of all children under five are chronically&#13;
malnourished. Malnutrition tends to increase during the weaning period. In general,&#13;
malnutrition resulting from inadequate weaning practices has a greater effect on the health&#13;
of poor children, particularly in Asunci6n, where more than one-quarter of all infants in&#13;
very poor households are undernourished. Iodine deficiency, which affects all ages, is also&#13;
an important health concern.&#13;
2.9    Child Development. Poverty increases the probability that a child will be&#13;
undemourished and unhealthy. It also increases the likelihood of stunted mental development.&#13;
The most rapid mental growth occurs during infancy and early childhood. Inadequate&#13;
intellectual stimulation and affective care combined with malnutrition are likely to result in&#13;
irreversible damage to a child's physical and mental development.8 Early child stimulation&#13;
programs targeting infants and toddlers and pre-school programs can improve school&#13;
readiness skills. Other benefits include: the lowering of primary school enrollment ages,&#13;
reduction of repetition and dropout rates, and improvement in academic performance.&#13;
Parental involvement in programs also appears to strengthen the positive impact of early&#13;
childhood interventions.&#13;
2.10  Pre-schools are scarce in Paraguay. Less than four percent of children six years of&#13;
age and under are enrolled in pre-school. Other options for children are childcare centers&#13;
("guarderias" and "jardines infantiles"), the majority of which are privately owned and&#13;
managed. The only pre-school program targeting low-income children is the Mita i Roga&#13;
Program, established by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF in 1984. However, the&#13;
program has been seriously weakened due to lack of funding which has severely restricted&#13;
the training and supervision of its largely volunteer staff. Today, its coverage is&#13;
insignificant. The Social Welfare Directorate (DGBS) of the MSPBS also targets low-&#13;
income groups through its small network of community child care centers. However,&#13;
child care centers provide no educational inputs for the children. Only seven of them have&#13;
been specifically organized as child development centers where some early stimulation and&#13;
food supplementation is provided. Originally, the DGBS covered all installation and&#13;
operating costs. In the past two years, the DGBS has been developing a strategy to get&#13;
communities to cover operating costs and some installation costs.&#13;
2.11   Given the increasing participation of mothers in the labor force, demand for child&#13;
care options has increased in recent years, particularly in urban areas. Twenty percent of&#13;
all women are in the formal labor force. The proportion of women employed in the&#13;
informal sector is also likely to be sizable, particularly among the poor. Since poor&#13;
mothers have less purchasing power to obtain either child care or pre-school education for&#13;
their children, access to child development centers would improve children's welfare&#13;
directly through early stimulation programs, and indirectly by allowing the mother to work&#13;
and be able to better contribute to her children's education.&#13;

B. STRUCTURE OF THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
2.12   Sector Organization and Coverage. Health care in Paraguay is provided by the&#13;
Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (Ministerio de Salud Publica y Bienestar&#13;
Social, MSPBS), the Institute of Social Security (Instituto de Previsi6n Social, IPS), the&#13;
Police Health Service (Sanidad Policial, SP), the Armed Forces Health Service (Sanidad&#13;
Militar, SM), and through the four University teaching hospitals, two of them belonging to&#13;
the University of Asunci6n (Hospital de Clinicas (HC) and the Neuropsychiatric Hospital)&#13;
and two affiliated with the Catholic University. The MSPBS provides both curative and&#13;
preventive care,9 with an emphasis on the former. The rest of the public sector provides&#13;
only curative care. The HC is a highly specialized tertiary care facility which accepts&#13;
referrals from all institutions. Private health care is provided by hospitals, clinics, and&#13;
laboratories, some of which function through various private insurance systems, and by&#13;
various NGOs with limited coverage. The Mennonites also provide some hospital and&#13;
clinic care, and the Pastoral Social (formerly Caritas) provides some primary health care&#13;
at the community level. NGOs and the Pastoral Social provide primarily preventive care.&#13;
In addition, care is provided informally by pharmacies, midwives and traditional healers.&#13;
2.13   The MSPBS is responsible for the health needs of the Paraguayan population,&#13;
focusing its efforts on those not covered by other institutions, namely low income&#13;
households. In theory, MSPBS covers 60 percent of the population, [PS another 14&#13;
percent, SM 8 percent, HC 5 percent, SP another 1 percent and the private sector covers&#13;
the rest (about 12 percent). Actual utilization of services varies by type of care sought.&#13;
However, overall, about 30 to 45 percent of the population utilize MSPBS services. In&#13;
rural areas, utilization is about 50 percent. Low income groups, the focus of MSPBS&#13;
activities, rely on MSPBS and the HC primarily for more serious, expensive health&#13;
problems. They resort to pharmacies and traditional healers for minor ailments. In&#13;
Asunci6n, low income households are more likely to seek private services for minor&#13;
ailments. They also rely on services provided by religious institutions. The IPS covers all&#13;
salaried employees and their families, the SM all military employees and their families, and&#13;
the SP covers police employees and their dependents. As many as 40 percent of the&#13;
population covered by the IPS does not routinely utilize IPS services. The private sector&#13;
(excluding pharmacies) provides services to 30 to 40 percent of the population, and close&#13;
to half of the population in Asunci6n. Pharmacies play an important role in the delivery of&#13;
care, particularly in rural areas. Seven percent of the population relies on them. 10&#13;
2.14   Through DGBS, MSPBS provides childcare services to low income families&#13;
through a network of nurseries and child care centers installed in community facilities or&#13;
family homes. It also provides lodging for street children and other children at risk, day&#13;
9 In addition to curative care, the MSPBS is responsible for the control of immune-preventable diseases,&#13;
infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases, and for providing water and sanitation to rural areas and urban areas&#13;
under 5000 inhabitants.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
care centers for senior citizens, and counseling for battered women. In many of these&#13;
programs costs are shared with the community or other organizations. The coverage of&#13;
these programs is very limited.1"&#13;
2.15   Health Care Finance. Health care is financed with resources stemming from six&#13;
main sources: tax revenues from both central and municipal levels, social security payroll&#13;
taxes (including both employer and employee contributions), private insurance premium&#13;
payments, direct out-of-pocket contributions, foreign loans and donations (including from&#13;
UNFPA, UNICEF, USAID, Pastoral Social, and others). MSPBS financing comes from&#13;
tax revenues (55 percent), royalties from the Itaipu dam (23 percent), user fees (7 percent),&#13;
and in the case of SENEPA, from the 1.5 percent employer contribution to the IPS&#13;
(7 percent). "Other" sources, including foreign grants, account for 8 percent.&#13;
2.16   Public investment in health is limited in Paraguay. Including social security health&#13;
services, the Government of Paraguay spent less than 2.5 percent of GDP on health in&#13;
1994, compared with 2.1 percent in 1992. 12 MSPBS expenditures represented only one&#13;
percent of GDP. Public health accounts for 5.3 percent of total government spending.&#13;
The IPS absorbs one third of all public health expenditures and the MSPBS absorbs over&#13;
half (57 percent). The HC alone spends 5 percent of the allocated budget. Data on the&#13;
extent of private financing are lacking, but it is estimated to be higher than public funding.&#13;
Estimates of private expenditures suggest they represent at least 2.7 percent of GDP,&#13;
bringing total health expenditures in Paraguay to between 5 and 6 percent of GDP.&#13;
2.17   Although public spending for health was low in the early eighties due to the&#13;
recession, the trend reversed with the change of government in 1990. Between 1990 and&#13;
1992, central government spending for health more than doubled as a percentage of&#13;
nominal GDP, due primarily to salary increases unrelated to greater productivity. MSPBS&#13;
spending increased from 0.4 percent of GDP to 1.0 percent. It is estimated that about 80&#13;
percent of the MSPBS' recurrent costs cover salaries. Because of the dearth of medical&#13;
materials and supplies at the primary levels of care, salaries comprise 85 percent of&#13;
expenditures. Pharmaceuticals and supplies account for less than 10 percent. At the&#13;
tertiary level of care, where resources are concentrated, salaries account for 68 percent of&#13;
expenditures and pharmaceuticals and supplies account for 21 percent. The budget for the&#13;
DGBS represents 1.8 percent of the MSPBS' total budget.&#13;
At present only one center for the aged, seven child development centers, eight nurseries and six&#13;
Tazones de Leche ("glass of milk" supplementation centers) are in operation. Each center covers an&#13;
average of 35 children.&#13;
12 Budget execution averaged about 80 percent between 1992 and 1994. Most data on public&#13;
expenditures are based on budgeted rather than actual expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
3. KEY SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
3.1    Public health care in Paraguay has been characterized by an inadequate allocation&#13;
of resources and a weak and technically inefficient delivery system. Both translate into an&#13;
inequitable coverage of services to the detriment of more remote and poor populations,&#13;
and to generally low quality services. The limited emphasis on prevention has led to a&#13;
concentration of resources away from some of the more cost-effective interventions.&#13;
Weak management and limited policy analysis and formulation capability, both at central&#13;
and more peripheral levels (Departments and Municipalities), are likely to restrain even&#13;
further the opportune and efficient delivery of services.&#13;
3.2    The main weaknesses of the Paraguayan health system can be grouped into three&#13;
closely linked issues: equity, quality and efficiency.&#13;
A. EQUITY&#13;
3.3    Lack of Access to Health Resources. Health infrastructure and resources are&#13;
unevenly distributed. Tertiary care is concentrated in and around Asunci6n'3 and other&#13;
urban areas. Seventy percent of tertiary care facilities are located in Asunci6n and the&#13;
surrounding areas, and only 4 percent in the northern and eastern departments which&#13;
contain 30 percent of the population. Secondary and primary care facilities are more&#13;
evenly distributed. However, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and equipment are&#13;
often scarce at lower levels of care. Thus, the rural population has limited access to&#13;
tertiary health care, and access only to resource-poor facilities at the secondary and&#13;
primary levels. Obstetric complications, an important cause of maternal morbidity and&#13;
mortality, cannot be appropriately cared for in rural facilities, and due to staff shortages,&#13;
also fail to be resolved in many secondary level facilities.&#13;
3.4    The lack of basic infrastructure and limited purchasing power of the population has&#13;
also discouraged private providers from establishing services in many areas. Although&#13;
both the IPS and SM have health centers outside Asunci6n, they are fewer in number, and&#13;
only accept individuals covered by social security (in the case of IPS) and members of the&#13;
military (in the case of SM). Outside Asunci6n, the only providers serving the poor are&#13;
the MSPBS, traditional community providers (midwives and healers), and religious&#13;
organizations such as Pastoral Social and the Mennonites. Moreover, given the emphasis&#13;
on curative care, available services have only a limited capacity to improve reproductive&#13;
and child health.&#13;
3.5    Even when facilities are available, their location is not always appropriate, making&#13;
it difficult for a system of referrals and distribution of supplies to work properly. Roads&#13;
are often unpaved and impassable during the rainy season, and river transportation is slow&#13;
13 Three of the most highly specialized hospitals (Hospital Nacional, Hospital del Quemado, and&#13;
Hospital de Cancer) are located in Central Department, a few miles from the center of Asunci6n).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
and infrequent. The poor and inefficient communications system aggravates the problem&#13;
even further. Posts and centers lack radios and telephones. Regional hospitals possess&#13;
only one or two telephone lines. Staff in health posts have bicycles or motorcycles, but&#13;
often work alone and cannot leave the post. Thus, access to some remote populations can&#13;
be severely restricted.&#13;
3.6    Given existing infrastructure maldistribution and deficiencies, poor&#13;
communications and lack of amenities, health personnel have few incentives to work in&#13;
resource-poor regions. Precise figures regarding the distribution of health personnel are&#13;
difficult to obtain because many hold more than one post, and can be registered as working in&#13;
one department when they in fact work in another (usually Asunci6n). Available figures&#13;
indicate that most physicians, including the medical staff of the MSPBS, are located in&#13;
Asunci6n and Central, as are licensed nurses and auxiliary nurses. The northern departments&#13;
have the largest deficit of health personnel.&#13;
3.7    Unequal Distribution of the Burden of Disease. The unequal access to health&#13;
resources has contributed to higher morbidity and mortality in the more remote&#13;
departments and rural areas in general, than in Asunci6n and its environs. Infant mortality&#13;
rates are three times higher in Alto Paraguay than in Asunci6n. The same is true for&#13;
maternal mortality.&#13;
B. QUALITY&#13;
3.8    The deficient quality of care is reflected in low occupancy and utilization rates.&#13;
Many of the elements that determine quality of services need to be strengthened in&#13;
Paraguay. Among the more important dimensions of quality are: technical competence,&#13;
client/provider relations, timely availability of inputs (human resources, pharmaceuticals,&#13;
and supplies) and adequate service infrastructure. Quality deteriorates with the level of&#13;
care. Primary care lacks the most inputs. Posts lack the needed pharmaceuticals, are&#13;
inadequately staffed, and equipment is often lacking or malfunctioning. The limited&#13;
capability of the lower levels of care to resolve many of the cases they receive has broken&#13;
down the referral system and has forced patients to go directly to the regional hospitals or&#13;
to Asunci6n.&#13;
3.9    Weak Service Delivery Infrastructure. Health infrastructure, even in the case of&#13;
some recently constructed facilities, is in an advanced state of deterioration. Some&#13;
infrastructure is very old and outdated. In other cases, including recent construction, the&#13;
building materials employed have been of substandard quality, leading to rapid decay.&#13;
However, the most important reason for the deteriorated state of infrastructure has to do&#13;
with a lack of maintenance of existing facilities. Health facilities are given a very small&#13;
budget for maintenance, and the needed funds are partially covered by a sometimes&#13;
unstable source, i.e., royalties from the Itaipu hydroelectric dam. Construction, even&#13;
when in an acceptable physical state, is often designed without adequate functional&#13;
planning, particularly when renovations are made to existing facilities, causing some of the&#13;
existing infrastructure to be less effectively used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.10  Equipment, both medical and non-medical, is also deteriorated and outdated.&#13;
Medical equipment and instruments are often lacking due to insufficient resources. As in&#13;
the case of infrastructure, equipment maintenance has not been a priority in the past. Staff&#13;
employing the equipment often lack the training to do so, leading to a greater rate of&#13;
malfunction than would otherwise be expected. A lack of inventory and control of&#13;
equipment has resulted in significant losses.&#13;
3.11   Availability and Timeliness of Inputs. Health facilities, particularly health centers&#13;
and posts, often lack some basic medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Patients have to&#13;
purchase supplies and medications in local pharmacies to receive treatment at centers and&#13;
posts. The current pharmaceutical supply system is administratively cumbersome and&#13;
exceedingly slow. Although regional facilities make periodic requests for pharmaceuticals&#13;
needed, they often receive neither the amount nor the products requested. Moreover,&#13;
budget allocations for pharmaceuticals and supplies are insufficient and favor hospitals,&#13;
leaving centers and posts with minimal supplies. Part of the problem stems from the fact&#13;
that, as is the case with funds for infrastructure maintenance, royalties from the Itaipui&#13;
hydro-electric dam have been employed to finance these items. And, the "social&#13;
pharmacies" established with revolving funds in each regional hospital to provide the&#13;
population with lower-cost pharmaceuticals several years ago have failed to replenish their&#13;
stocks because of inadequate inventory control. A lack of needed pharmaceuticals and&#13;
supplies at facilities can severely reduce effectiveness of treatment of emergencies.&#13;
3.12  Also lacking, particularly at the more peripheral levels, are physicians. Many&#13;
centers are understaffed and even when physicians are available, they generally work only&#13;
a few hours before going to their private practice.&#13;
3.13  Provider Technical Competence. Components of the service delivery system&#13;
designed to ensure the proper functioning of "hardware" inputs are also weak.&#13;
Supervision of services is minimal, normative standards are sometimes inadequate and&#13;
often not observed, training is limited and inappropriate, and management skills of&#13;
administrative staff are insufficient. Supervision of posts and centers takes place only two&#13;
or three times per year, and is generally limited to the collection of service statistics and&#13;
the delivery of goods. Auxiliary nurses, who are required to have a minimum of primary&#13;
school education (but in practice often do not), receive only nine months of training prior&#13;
to their employment as nurse's aides. Licensed nurses do receive four years of college&#13;
level training, but are few in number. Funding for training has been scarce, and often&#13;
personnel shortages do not permit existing staff to take the time to attend training&#13;
sessions. Moreover, the training methodology employed is inadequate. Courses have a&#13;
theoretical rather than practical orientation, with training materials often having a limited&#13;
bearing on the functions staff are expected to perform.&#13;
3.14   Client-Provider Relations. The human dimension of service delivery, i.e., the&#13;
quality of interactions between health staff and the client, is also deficient. Complaints&#13;
about poor attitudes towards patients are common. Providers also fail to communicate&#13;
important health information to clients during clinic visits, leaving patients with little&#13;
understanding of how to deal with their ailments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
C. TECHNICAL AND ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY&#13;
3.15  Insufficient Emphasis on Preventive Care. Curative care absorbs most of the&#13;
MSPBS' budget. As a result, many important preventive activities fall short of needs.&#13;
The emphasis on family planning is also insufficient. Despite the high levels of maternal&#13;
mortality and morbidity derived from complications of induced abortion, few women&#13;
receive any guidance regarding contraception while hospitalized. Health centers and&#13;
regional hospitals attend two women with complications of induced abortion for every&#13;
birth they deliver. Treatment of complications of induced abortion are high in comparison&#13;
to the costs of providing family planning services. The Government has relied completely&#13;
on foreign aid to satisfy this need and thus does not budget funds for contraceptives.&#13;
Contraceptive supplies are often lacking, and services and information are provided only&#13;
two or three mornings per week. Family planning counseling is not provided on a regular&#13;
basis, nor are high risk groups such as women under 20 years of age targeted. Basic&#13;
training of health personnel only recently began to include training on reproductive health.&#13;
3.16  Health education is not one of the priorities of center and post staff. Health&#13;
facilities lack educational materials for clients, and no structured health education sessions&#13;
are held. The only opportunity to transmit health information to patients is during clinic&#13;
visits, and few health staff take advantage of this opportunity to inform and educate&#13;
patients. Growth monitoring is not consistently performed. Community outreach is rare,&#13;
as health post staff are unable to leave their post due to a shortage of staff In 1990 (ends&#13;
1991), only about 50 percent of all children received the needed dosages of measles, polio&#13;
and DPT vaccination, and only 40 percent received it in the North. Only one-third of all&#13;
children receive all vaccinations. Tetanus toxoid immunization coverage is higher with&#13;
two-thirds of women sampled having received full tetanus immunization during their last&#13;
pregnancy.&#13;
3.17  One of the few programs that does focus on prevention is the child development&#13;
program of the DGBS. As part of its effort to address the mental and physical health of&#13;
children under 5 years of age, the DGBS has established community centers (Centros de&#13;
Bienestar de la Infancia y la Familia, CEBINFA) providing early childhood stimulation,&#13;
food supplementation, and facilitating access to health services. They also provide&#13;
training in childcare for caretaking mothers. However, the centers are few in number, and&#13;
educational activities do not focus sufficiently on health and nutrition education for&#13;
mothers.&#13;
3.18 Weak Management Capability. Management skills are deficient at all levels, and&#13;
are most deficient at peripheral levels. The MSPBS lacks the information required to&#13;
make rational resource allocation decisions. Many staff also lack the necessary training to&#13;
employ available information for policy and resource allocation purposes. In addition to&#13;
facing the same lack of inputs, regional managers also have had less experience in making&#13;
allocative decisions. Because all decision-making has been very centralized in the past,&#13;
they have had few incentives to improve their management skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3.19  The proposed project would improve the coverage and quality of maternal and&#13;
child health services by ensuring health facilities would have timely basic inputs such as&#13;
pharmaceuticals and supplies, adequate infrastructure and equipment, competent staff, and&#13;
an informed clientele. Coverage would be expanded by rehabilitating existing&#13;
infrastructure, by improving the communication between facilities to enhance referrals, and&#13;
by improving the quality of services in existing facilities.&#13;
4. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
4.1   The Government's main priority is to improve the standard of living of its people&#13;
through private sector-led growth, a stable economy, and the protection of the most&#13;
vulnerable sectors of society. The Government sees public health and social welfare&#13;
services as playing a key role in the protection of the poor. Both the high rates of&#13;
maternal mortality and fertility have raised concern among Government officials. At&#13;
current rates, economic growth (at 3. 1 percent per annum, 1992-1994) has barely kept up&#13;
with population growth (also at 3. 1 percent), making it difficult for public services to&#13;
increase coverage. Because prior to 1989 the Government had a pronatalist orientation, it&#13;
was not until the beginning of democratic rule that the Government showed concern for&#13;
the high rates of population growth and took a more proactive role. The Constitution&#13;
drafted in 1992 protects the right of families to decide the number of children they want to&#13;
have. It also gives public services the responsibility to provide the low income segments&#13;
of the population with reproductive health services, paving the way for the provision of&#13;
family planning services in MSPBS facilities- Both high fertility and maternal mortality can&#13;
be reduced through effective reproductive health services.&#13;
4.2   In response to the current state of maternal and perinatal health, the Government&#13;
drafted a National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality in 1994, to&#13;
be implemented in conjunction with other public and private providers with both local and&#13;
external funding. Its goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 50 percent and perinatal&#13;
mortality by 30 percent by 1998. The Plan aims to increase human resource capacity,&#13;
improve infrastructure, increase availability of supplies, expand coverage, improve the&#13;
quality of care, strengthen local participation, improve the information, education and&#13;
communication capability, and develop an information system for effective decision-&#13;
making. Although general in nature, the Plan provides a policy framework under which&#13;
concrete interventions can be developed.&#13;
4.3    Activities performed as part of the Plan are being coordinated by the recently&#13;
established National Council on Reproductive Health and Family Planning, which consists&#13;
of representatives of Government ministries and institutions, international organizations,&#13;
local providers and NGOs involved in reproductive health. Donors participating in this&#13;
venture include UNFPA (the main donor, which is expected to provide US$2.2 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
between 1994 and 1996), USAID,'4 UNICEF, IPPF and PAHO. Support includes&#13;
primarily technical assistance, pharmaceuticals, equipment and training. USAID is&#13;
continuing support for the Centro Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblaci6n (CEPEP),&#13;
providing technical assistance for management, financing a reproductive health survey, and&#13;
providing some training and contraceptive supplies for the government program.&#13;
UNICEF and PAHO are supporting training programs, and UNICEF is also providing&#13;
some supplies for child health including birth kits for midwives. The Spanish Government&#13;
has also extended a $36.0-million line of credit for medical equipment, including&#13;
equipment for delivery and emergency care. Like the IBRD, the IDB is currently&#13;
preparing a project which will provide maternal and child health services in five&#13;
departments. The IBRD and IDB are closely coordinating project preparation to ensure&#13;
complementarity between the two and consistency with the objectives of the National Plan&#13;
for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality.&#13;
4.4   Commitment to improve the health and development of children has also been&#13;
visible. After the change in government in 1989, the Paraguayan Government has given&#13;
increased importance to social welfare issues. The section of MSPBS that was responsible&#13;
for social welfare has been converted to a full Directorate (DGBS), and has been allocated&#13;
its own resources. DGBS has been gradually increasing its institutional capacity and the&#13;
number and variety of programs it directs. The 1992 Constitution mandates that the state&#13;
shall promote family welfare through the provision of social welfare programs based on&#13;
health education and community participation.&#13;
4.5   Since the adoption of the new Constitution, a number of initiatives have emerged&#13;
which place considerably more weight on community financing and participation in the&#13;
operation of several of DGBS activities. DGBS is also working on strengthening its role&#13;
as a policy/norm setter, by providing communities technical assistance to establish their&#13;
own child care centers. The day care centers and technical assistance activities to be&#13;
supported under the proposed project aim to strengthen the DGBS' ability to provide&#13;
technical assistance, and to expand child care services with a strong role for the&#13;
community.&#13;
5. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE SECTOR&#13;
A. THE BANK'S STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT&#13;
5.1   In response to deteriorating macroeconomic management, the Bank suspended&#13;
disbursements of ongoing operations in Paraguay in the early 1980s. Government policies&#13;
during that period had aggravated the recession, and fueled corruption and inflation. By&#13;
1989, with the change in government, macroeconomic management improved&#13;
14 USAID funding for Paraguay is being considerably reduced. Funding, which was $643,000 in FY 1990&#13;
was reduced to $327,000 in FY1994. IPPF has also reduced funding in the 1994-1997 funding cycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
dramatically, leading the Bank to reestablish its partnership with Paraguay in the early&#13;
1990s. In support of renewed operations, initial efforts focused on updating the Bank's&#13;
knowledge of the Paraguayan economy and current economic and social conditions. 15 A&#13;
new country assistance strategy (CAS) was developed on the basis of the results of the&#13;
economic and sector studies.&#13;
5.2    The Bank's assistance strategy in Paraguay16 seeks to support: (a) private sector&#13;
development; (b) agricultural development and natural resource management; and (c)&#13;
poverty alleviation with human resource development. The CAS identifies the&#13;
improvement of social service delivery as a priority to alleviate poverty and improve&#13;
human resources. It notes the importance of improving the targeting of health services,&#13;
service quality, and resource allocation within the sector. Maternal and child morbidity&#13;
and mortality were identified as being unnecessarily high given that they are easily&#13;
prevented. The need to strengthen institutional capacity, particularly in the areas of&#13;
investment and budget planning, management, accounting and control, and other measures&#13;
to increase administrative efficiency was stressed. The strengthening of management&#13;
capability at all levels was highlighted, in light of the decentralization and deconcentration&#13;
of social services that is beginning to take place. To date, three projects addressing the&#13;
third objective have been approved since the Bank resumed lending to Paraguay: the Third&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Ln. 3519-PA) approved in 1992, the&#13;
Asunci6n Sewerage Project (Ln. 3842-PA) approved in 1994, and the recently approved&#13;
Secondary Education Improvement Project (Ln. 3941-PA). The proposed project fully&#13;
supports the country assistance strategy since its main objective is to strengthen the&#13;
delivery of maternal and child health services. It would also assist in the decentralization&#13;
of health services through the strengthening of management capabilities at both central and&#13;
regional levels.&#13;
5.3    A poverty assessment conducted by the Bank in 1994 identified the characteristics&#13;
of the poor in Paraguay, and found poverty to be associated with low education, poor&#13;
health, recent migration, female headship and indigenous background. It also identified the&#13;
poor as being located principally in the periphery of Asunci6n, the northem departments of&#13;
the country and part of the East. The report highlights the deficient access to health&#13;
services in these areas and specifically among the poor. The report notes that the&#13;
inadequate distribution of health resources has resulted in significantly higher rates of&#13;
maternal and child morbidity and mortality in these areas.&#13;
5.4    The proposed project's design and objectives are also consistent with the key&#13;
recommendations of the poverty report. The report recommends improving maternal and&#13;
15 A Country Economic Memorandum - CEM (Report No. 9147-PA dated October 15, 1991), a Public&#13;
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA dated June 16, 1992), a study of the&#13;
implications of Paraguay's joining the MERCOSUR trade area (Report No. 10902-PA dated January 28,&#13;
1993), and a poverty assessment (Poverty and the Social Sectors in Paraguay, Report No. 12293-PA, dated&#13;
June 29, 1994).&#13;
16 The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Paraguay was discussed and approved by the Board of&#13;
Executive Directors on December 21, 1993, and is contained in Report P-5916-PA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
child health by: (i) targeting the poor; (ii) strengthening service delivery: (iii) increasing&#13;
the emphasis on preventive health; (iv) strengthening collaboration with the community,&#13;
NGOs and other providers to improve health status; and (v) improving management&#13;
capability in MSPBS and its programs. The project would specifically address all of the&#13;
above issues. It is expected that the project's integrated child development program&#13;
would not only enhance child development but would also improve working opportunities&#13;
for women. In line with the recommendations, the project would focus on six&#13;
predominantly rural departments in the North and East of the country. It would also&#13;
target the urban fringes of Asunci6n, another area of high incidence of poverty identified&#13;
by the report.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
5.5   The lessons from previous Bank-financed projects in Paraguay have been closely&#13;
examined and have shaped the strategy adopted in this project. Lessons from health and&#13;
early childhood development projects supported by the Bank in other regions, and other&#13;
agencies have also influenced project design.&#13;
5.6   There has been no previous Bank experience with health sector projects in&#13;
Paraguay. However, previously financed education and water supply projects as well as&#13;
projects currently under implementation revealed problems related to weak institutional&#13;
capacity. To reduce potential problems caused by weak institutional capacity, the project&#13;
has been kept small and its design has been kept simple. The project contains only one&#13;
main component (health), and two very small components: a small child development&#13;
pilot to be implemented by a separate branch of the MSPBS (Bienestar Social), and a&#13;
small institutional strengthening component. The project will focus on a limited number of&#13;
priority interventions (maternal and child health care, family planning and early childhood&#13;
development). With the exception of child development activities, all interventions are&#13;
contained in the National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality, and&#13;
are thus not introducing new programs. All innovative activities not part of the MSPBS'&#13;
normal work will be contracted out to NGOs. The design of the subcomponents is&#13;
flexible, allowing adjustments to be made annually, responding to local capabilities. All&#13;
health activities will be conducted in contiguous, homogeneous departments requiring&#13;
similar approaches. The child development pilot will be conducted in Asunci6n, where the&#13;
need for those services is greatest and supervision is more easily conducted. Utilizing a&#13;
pilot approach has the benefits of providing ample information as to what works in the&#13;
Paraguayan context without the expense of a large operation.&#13;
5.7   Most Bank-financed projects in Paraguay have experienced implementation&#13;
problems associated with delays in counterpart funding, cumbersome administrative&#13;
procedures, a lack of experience with Bank procurement and disbursement procedures,&#13;
and poor staffing. Delays in the availability of counterpart funding due to poor&#13;
programming and budgeting have seriously delayed execution of several projects (three&#13;
Bank-supported education projects (Loans 1346-PA, 2373-PA, and 1992-PA), and the&#13;
two rural water and sanitation projects (Loans 1502-PA and 2014-PA)). Counterpart&#13;
funding has also been a problem in several projects currently under implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Delays in access to counterpart funds would be minimized through the inclusion of clear&#13;
guidelines and procedures regarding the necessary planning and timing to ensure timely&#13;
access in the Project Operational Manual. This will be done under close consultation with&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Counterpart amounts and disbursement mechanisms will&#13;
be agreed upon early on.&#13;
5.8   The implementation of all three Bank-supported education projects (Loans 1346-&#13;
PA, 2373-PA, and 1992-PA) was also seriously delayed by the cumbersome procedures&#13;
that procurement entails and by a lack of experience with Bank procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures. Limited management capability has surfaced as a problem in the&#13;
majority of projects. The three education projects confirmed the value of establishing a&#13;
strong project implementation unit to mitigate the effects of bureaucratic delays.&#13;
Experiences from both the sanitation and education projects also revealed the importance&#13;
of (a) addressing procurement and disbursement issues early in project preparation and&#13;
promptly resolving problems that arise during implementation; and (b) adequate&#13;
supervision. To reduce procurement and disbursement delays, project staff will receive&#13;
ample training on Bank procedures during project preparation and prior to effectiveness&#13;
through the participation of project staff in procurement and disbursement seminars and&#13;
visiting ongoing Bank-financed projects. In addition, the preparation of detailed&#13;
Operational Manuals outlining procedures to be followed for both procurement and&#13;
disbursement will mitigate these problems.&#13;
5.9   The key lesson from the two completed rural water and sanitation projects (Loans&#13;
1502-PA and 2014-PA) is the importance of community participation for project success&#13;
and sustainability. This project would work closely with the community to deliver health&#13;
messages and some basic preventive care through community health workers and&#13;
midwives in rural areas. In urban areas the project would work with community mothers&#13;
to manage the child development centers. As the project becomes more established, pilot&#13;
experiences would be set up in which the community would work with MSPBS staff to&#13;
manage and supervise services.&#13;
5.10  Several reviews of the implementation experience of health projects have pointed&#13;
out the benefits of the following elements for effective project execution: (a) simple&#13;
project design; (b) built-in flexibility; (c) strong monitoring and evaluation; and (d) a focus&#13;
on existing government programs instead of new proposals. On the basis of a review of&#13;
worldwide experience in reproductive health care, the 1993 World Development Report.&#13;
Investing in Health (WDR) highlighted the need to include the following three&#13;
components in reproductive health programs: (a) an information, education, and&#13;
communications component to generate demand for preventive health services, inform and&#13;
educate women regarding their own and their child's health, and mobilize the community;&#13;
(b) a community-assisted reproductive health component with trained nurses-midwives to&#13;
provide prenatal care, normal deliveries, family planning information and nonclinical&#13;
methods, obstetric first-aid, and early referral of severe complications; and (c) support to&#13;
district hospitals to provide essential obstetric services. In keeping with lessons from&#13;
experience in health projects, and recommendations from the World Development Report,&#13;
all three components of reproductive health programs recommended will be included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
5.11  Reviews of experiences in early child development programs point out that, in&#13;
order to be successful, the design of such programs should pay close attention to: (a)&#13;
targeting the neediest communities and children at high risk within the communities; (b)&#13;
developing an integrated strategy that includes health, nutrition and education; (c)&#13;
securing family and community participation; (d) providing continuous training and&#13;
supervision to caregivers; and (e) guaranteeing adequate sanitary and safe water systems.&#13;
Child development activities will target low-income areas of Asunci6n, will entail&#13;
substantial community support and participation, will provide health, nutrition and early&#13;
stimulation interventions and will provide training and supervision for caregivers.&#13;
6. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.1   The main objective of the Maternal Health and Child Development Project is to&#13;
improve the health status of the underserved Paraguayan population, particularly women&#13;
and children. To achieve this objective, the project would: (a) increase the coverage,&#13;
quality and efficiency of basic maternal and child health services in six underserved&#13;
departments in Northeastern Paraguay; (b) increase the population's knowledge about&#13;
adequate health practices; (c) pilot-test a strategy to enhance early child development in&#13;
Asunci6n, and (d) strengthen management capability in support of an eventual&#13;
decentralization of public health services in Project areas. Coverage and quality of&#13;
maternal and child health services will be strengthened by improving the physical state of&#13;
available infrastructure, ensuring availability of needed equipment and pharmaceuticals,&#13;
improving provider competence, increasing the emphasis on preventive care, and&#13;
expanding community outreach. Efficiency would be increased by prioritizing&#13;
interventions that address the key epidemiological concerns of the project area, and by&#13;
improving the management of services. Health education activities would enhance the&#13;
demand for preventive services and would increase awareness of health issues. The&#13;
Project would improve early child development by pilot-testing community-financed&#13;
and/or managed early child development centers. The early child development pilot, in&#13;
addition to providing direct benefits to participating children, would define investment&#13;
priorities for a possible future project.&#13;
6.2   The Project consists of one main component addressing maternal and child health&#13;
needs, and two small supplemental components: an early child development pilot, and a&#13;
component aimed at strengthening departmental readiness for decentralization and a&#13;
decentralized execution of the project. It is expected that the Project would (a) increase&#13;
the coverage and quality of institutional deliveries; (b) improve the safety of home&#13;
deliveries; (c) improve the detection, transport and treatment of obstetric complications;&#13;
(d) improve access to reproductive health services and information (including family&#13;
planning, sexually-transmitted disease (STD) prevention and treatment, reproductive risk&#13;
awareness); (e) improve immunization coverage (both for mothers and children);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
(f) reduce the incidence of ARI and diarrheal disease; (g) improve children's schooling&#13;
readiness; and (h) increase community involvement in both health and child development&#13;
activities.&#13;
B. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AREAS&#13;
6.3   The project will cover six of the poorest departments, all located in the Northeast&#13;
(Table 1, and Map on page 87). The departments covered by the project are Alto&#13;
Paraguay, Concepci6n, Amambay, Canindeyui, San Pedro, and Alto Parana. The child&#13;
development pilot will be implemented in the low-income areas of Asunci6n. The six&#13;
departments are predominantly rural, and have limited access to running water, electricity&#13;
and sewage disposal (Annex 1, Table 3). Infant mortality is above the national average of&#13;
43.3 infant deaths per 1000 live births, in all but one of the included departments. With&#13;
the exception of Alto Parana, fertility is also above the national average of 4.7 children per&#13;
woman. The total population to be covered (i.e. the poor) by the health component is&#13;
approximately 500,000, out of which 210,000 are children under five years of age and&#13;
women of reproductive age (Annex 1, Table 4). The child development pilot will cover&#13;
part of Asunci6n's 6200 poor children under five years of age.&#13;
6.4   Each one of the participating Departments corresponds to a health region. All but&#13;
one of the health regions'7 has a regional hospital, the highest level of care available in&#13;
each region. A total of five regional hospitals, 26 health centers and 144 health posts are&#13;
located in the Project area. All hospitals have very low occupancy rates (Annex 1, Table&#13;
5). Occupancy is lowest where physicians per population are the most scarce, i.e. San&#13;
Pedro, Canindey[, Concepci6n and Alto Parana.&#13;
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
Component I: Maternal and Child Health Care (US$ 20.1 million, 74 percent of&#13;
total project costs).&#13;
6.5   This component would improve the health of women and children in project areas&#13;
by: (a) providing a predefined set of health interventions which respond to the&#13;
epidemiological profile of the area, including reproductive health; (b) strengthening the&#13;
delivery of services by improving the physical state of existing infrastructure, ensuring&#13;
availability of needed equipment and pharmaceuticals, strengthening referral capability (in&#13;
terms of transport, communications and procedures); and, improving provider&#13;
competence, (c) increasing the emphasis on preventive care through health education and&#13;
community outreach; and, (d) involving the community in health promotion and service&#13;
delivery by training community workers in the detection of pregnancy complications and&#13;
the main causes of maternal and child morbidity, the provision of some elementary&#13;
preventive services, and the organization of the community for immunization campaigns&#13;
and for the transportation of women undergoing obstetric complications.&#13;
17 Alto Paraguay does not have a Regional Hospital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
6.6   The four strategies outlined above will translate into the following services and&#13;
activities: (a) a package of health services for women and children containing:&#13;
reproductive health services, including prenatal care, safe delivery, postpartum care,&#13;
treatment of STDs (syphilis and gonorrhea), and family planning for all women, and&#13;
immunization, iodine supplementation, deworming, treatment of acute respiratory&#13;
infections (ARI) and diarrheal disease for children under 5 years of age, and growth&#13;
monitoring for children under 3 years of age, (b) the identification of women of high&#13;
reproductive risk, or with complications of pregnancy or negative side-effects of&#13;
contraception, and detection of child morbidity (ARI, diarrheal disease, malnutrition) for&#13;
referral to the health network and for community-based health education; (c) the provision&#13;
of health education and some basic preventive care, including some contraception, oral&#13;
rehydration salts, and growth monitoring, among others, by community midwives and&#13;
health workers; (d) the organization of community resources to transport women with&#13;
pregnancy complications to the appropriate level of care where MSPBS transportation is&#13;
unavailable. The MSPBS provides all services included under (a) as part of its maternal&#13;
and child health program. The protocols for all health services to be supported under the&#13;
project have been agreed between the Bank and the Government, and are described in&#13;
detail in Annex 2. Given the high rates of adolescent fertility, efforts will be made to reach&#13;
non-pregnant women, particularly women under 20 years of age, to ensure they are&#13;
adequately informed regarding reproductive health issues. The project will not finance&#13;
immunization and iodine supplementation as they are covered through separate programs&#13;
of the MSPBS. However, project staff will coordinate with those programs to ensure&#13;
timely availability in project areas.&#13;
6.7   Services will be provided by medical and paramedical staff at health facilities, and&#13;
by community health workers (CHWs) and midwives in the community. The services to&#13;
be provided in health facilities will differ by level of care, with facilities staffed with&#13;
physicians providing more comprehensive care. Given staff shortages in facilities at all&#13;
levels, the project is placing great emphasis on the role of CHWs in the delivery of some&#13;
services. Midwives will perform deliveries both in the community and at health facilities&#13;
where necessary. CHWs and midwives will have an important role in outreach activities&#13;
including individual and group health education, and in the identification of pregnant&#13;
women, malnourished or ill children for referral to a health facility. In addition, CHWs&#13;
will conduct growth monitoring of children under three years of age. Trained midwives&#13;
who currently deliver half of all births and provide some prenatal care will continue to do&#13;
so although with additional training and supplies provided by the project. They will also&#13;
provide family planning information and will supply oral contraceptives and barrier&#13;
methods. In order to ensure coordination of activities and quality of care, some of the&#13;
community visits will be conducted jointly by auxiliary staff at the health post and centers&#13;
and CHWs. Midwives will charge for deliveries. Pilot projects will be designed to&#13;
provide incentives for midwives to provide family planning information and some&#13;
methods, and to remunerate CHWs will be designed and tested.&#13;
6.8   In view of staffing problems, it was agreed that, to ensure the effectiveness of&#13;
project inputs, a health facility would have to be staffed with a critical mass to permit&#13;
regular functions to be conducted in order to be able to receive project funding for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
infrastructure and equipment. According to MSPBS norms, regional hospitals should&#13;
have at least 13 physicians and centers should have two. Health posts should be staffed by&#13;
two auxiliary nurses. However, many health posts are staffed by only one auxiliary,&#13;
centers often have licensed nurses instead of physicians, and hospitals function with fewer&#13;
doctors than they need.'8 The minimum staffing would be as follows: Posts would have&#13;
to be staffed with at least a full-time obstetrical auxiliary nurse; health centers would have&#13;
to have a physician on the premises for at least 20 hours a week (20 physician-hours), 10&#13;
pediatrician hours per week, 20 obstetrician or obstetrical licensed nurse hours per week,&#13;
and 8 auxiliaries, 3 of which would be obstetrical auxiliaries; and regional hospitals would&#13;
have to have 20-physician hours per week in each of the specializations (OBGYN,&#13;
pediatrics, surgery and medicine). No minimums would be set to participate in the training&#13;
and IEC activities or to obtain pharmaceuticals and supplies. An inventory of health staff&#13;
working in project areas will be included in the Master Investment Plans for infrastructure&#13;
(see below).&#13;
6.9    The proposed project would finance, as part of Component I: (a) the rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of health infrastructure in regional hospitals and health centers, the&#13;
provision and maintenance of medical equipment for maternal and child health services,&#13;
and communications equipment for the three levels of care; (b) basic pharmaceuticals and&#13;
medical supplies; (c) training of health sector and community personnel; and (d) an&#13;
information, education and communications (IEC) program to improve households'&#13;
knowledge about good health practices, disease prevention and available MSPBS services.&#13;
The project would also finance vehicles for supervision, computers, and office equipment&#13;
and supplies.&#13;
6.10 Subcomponent I.A.: Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Infrastructure and&#13;
Equipment (US$ 11.2 million). Most public health resources are absorbed by salaries&#13;
(80 to 85 percent) and pharmaceuticals and supplies (10 to 20 percent), leaving very little&#13;
for rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure. Moreover, available infrastructure is&#13;
often constructed with poor quality materials and without adequate functional planning,&#13;
and the location of facilities did not take demand and access factors into account. This&#13;
subcomponent will: (a) rehabilitate deteriorated infrastructure; (b) replace obsolete and&#13;
non-functioning equipment; (c) establish an equipment and infrastructure maintenance&#13;
system; and (d) provide communications equipment and vehicles to improve the referral&#13;
system. Although all levels of care can receive equipment, infrastructure rehabilitation will&#13;
be limited to regional hospitals and health centers since communities often contribute to&#13;
the renovation of health posts. The project will not cover any equipment provided&#13;
through other international sources. Under this component, the project will finance civil&#13;
works, equipment, vehicles and recurrent costs (maintenance). The loans will cover&#13;
maintenance costs on a declining basis. It will also finance training for maintenance staff.&#13;
is It is difficult to ascertain the staffing of health facilities because public posts (i.e. the salaries&#13;
designated to them) can be assigned to individuals who neither live in the area in which the post is&#13;
located nor perform the functions the post requires. A position as auxiliary nurse in a health center&#13;
in Concepci6n may be filled by a clerk in Asunci6n. Thus, some facilities may appear, on paper, to&#13;
have an excess of licensed nurses when in fact they may have a deficit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
6.11   Most investments'9 to be made were identified during project preparation. Work&#13;
conducted during preparation will be complemented by an analysis of the health network&#13;
and communications system in order to determine which facilities form an integral part of&#13;
the referral system, and assess the rehabilitation needs of remaining health centers and&#13;
critical health posts. The network study will permit a prioritization of investments and will&#13;
serve as the basis for the preparation of a Master Investment Plan (MIP) for each health&#13;
region which will identify, for each of the six years of the project, the investments to be&#13;
made including their maintenance component, their timing, and approximate cost. The&#13;
MIP will also contain a human resource census by facility. The MIP, which will be&#13;
prepared regionally, would be revised on an annual basis and included in an Annual&#13;
Implementation Plan (AIP). The proportion of rehabilitation funds assigned to each health&#13;
region will be proportionate to the assessed rehabilitation needs of each health region. As&#13;
a condition of disbursement for this subcomponent, each eligible health region&#13;
would present an MIP acceptable to the Bank, and assign a maintenance chief for&#13;
the region.&#13;
6.12   Investments to be included in the MIP and AIP would be prioritized on the basis of&#13;
pre-defined criteria (see Annex 3 for details of eligibility criteria). These eligibility criteria&#13;
include the following: (a) subprojects must involve only infrastructure and equipment&#13;
employed primarily for maternal and child care and ancillary services; (b) subproject&#13;
execution should not exceed 12 months and costs should not be greater than US$200,000;&#13;
(c) subprojects should not generate additional recurrent costs; in cases where the&#13;
generated incremental recurrent costs exceed fifteen percent of the value of the&#13;
investment, evidence will have to be presented demonstrating that the additional costs&#13;
(including both maintenance20 and operation) have been included in the Annual Budget&#13;
Law for that period and all subsequent years; (d) subproject types would consist of repair,&#13;
replacement or purchase of equipment, replacement or purchase of vehicles21; and,&#13;
rehabilitation, replacement, improvement or construction of infrastructure or&#13;
combinations of the above; (e) all subprojects must incorporate a maintenance component;&#13;
(f) subprojects must be based on rehabilitation needs identified during preparation (in the&#13;
case of regional hospitals and two centers)22 and as part of the network study (other&#13;
health centers); and, (g) facilities must be staffed with a critical mass (i.e., be staffed&#13;
according to a basic minimum defined above). The equipment to be covered by project&#13;
19 The specific rehabilitation needs of the five regional hospitals and two health centers which function as&#13;
regional referral centers were identified in detail during preparation. They represent 80 percent of&#13;
the civil works and equipment needs to be financed under the project.&#13;
20 The MSPBS is conducting a pilot experience in Cordillera in which the MOF permits facilities to keep&#13;
fees collected and to reinvest them in the facility. The project will expand this pilot to allow&#13;
facilities to cover maintenance with funds from user fees.&#13;
21 Where possible, available vehicles will be reassigned to facilities based on the results of the MIP.&#13;
Where additional vehicles are needed they will be obtained/purchased by the Government and&#13;
contributed as counterpart funds. Vehicle repair and maintenance will be covered by the loan.&#13;
22 The two health centers include San Estanislao, in San Pedro, and Fuerte Olimpo in Alto Paraguay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
funds was identified during preparation. It includes basic medical, industrial and&#13;
communications equipment, and vehicles (including motorcycles). Only equipment&#13;
contained in the list of essential equipment will be eligible for purchase. The list of eligible&#13;
equipment will be contained in an annex of the Operations Manual.&#13;
6.13   The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will administer this subcomponent. The&#13;
Regional Coordination Offices (RCOs), together with the regional directors and technical&#13;
assistance from PCU staff, will prepare detailed MIPs as soon as the network study is&#13;
finalized. The Regional Health Council will be involved in the prioritization of&#13;
investments to be included in the MIP. In order to phase rehabilitation activities, a fixed&#13;
amount of funding will be available annually (approximately US$2.5 million). Each year,&#13;
on the basis of its MIP, each health region will prepare and submit rehabilitation and&#13;
equipment subprojects to the Regional Coordinating Offices (RCOs) who will review them&#13;
to ascertain their completeness and adherence to pre-established eligibility criteria (as&#13;
outlined in the MIP). The total sum of projects to be submitted under the MIP will not&#13;
exceed the total assigned to the health region on the basis of the needs assessment. Given&#13;
the unevenness in project development capability among the health regions, technical&#13;
assistance in subproject preparation will be provided to health regions with more limited&#13;
capability. The involvement of the RCOs and regional players in the preparation of MIPs&#13;
and preparation and execution of investment subprojects will enhance local capability to&#13;
make resource allocation decisions and improve readiness for the decentralization of&#13;
health services. The annual updating of the project implementation plans will provide&#13;
flexibility to make necessary adjustments in response to local capacity and changing needs.&#13;
Of the total amount allocated to this component, approximately 25 percent will cover&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation, 30 percent will cover electrical and mechanical rehabilitation,&#13;
20 percent for medical equipment, 20 percent for maintenance of both infrastructure and&#13;
equipment and 5 to 10 percent for communications equipment and vehicles. New&#13;
construction will only be considered if deemed necessary to significantly increase the&#13;
functionality of existing or rehabilitated infrastructure. All procedures are outlined in&#13;
detail in an Operations Manual.&#13;
6.14   Subcomponent I.B.: Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies (US$6.6&#13;
million). The MSPBS allocates insufficient resources for pharmaceuticals, and its supply&#13;
system is very inefficient. Moreover, it relies on local manufacturers whose prices are at&#13;
least six times greater than international prices. This subcomponent will improve the&#13;
availability of the pharmaceuticals and supplies for basic maternal and child health services&#13;
by: (a) improving the efficiency of the supply system, and (b) providing pharmaceuticals&#13;
and medical supplies at reasonable prices. The project will cover the costs of&#13;
procurement, storage, transportation and distribution of the pharmaceuticals and supplies.&#13;
Only health facilities that have adequate storage conditions will be eligible to receive&#13;
project-financed pharmaceuticals. Facilities will be able to upgrade their storage areas&#13;
through the infrastructure rehabilitation subcomponent. Regional health storage areas are&#13;
also eligible for funding. The project will also cover training costs of regional staff for the&#13;
operation of the computerized inventory system (INVEC). Training for the operation&#13;
of INVEC cannot take place before the facility has an installed and functioning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
computer. Activities in this subcomponent will commence simultaneously in all project&#13;
areas.&#13;
6.15  An assessment of the efficiency of the MSPBS' pharmaceutical supply system&#13;
noted that most procurement is done centrally, with health regions often not receiving&#13;
what they order, (both in terms of the amount and type of products) and receiving their&#13;
purchases late. Moreover, the current system shows preferential treatment to tertiary&#13;
care, leaving most primary level facilities with few pharmaceuticals. Some health regions&#13;
have begun to procure some of the products themselves, reducing many of these problems&#13;
although at a higher cost. To minimize supply problems, procurement would employ&#13;
centralized bidding and payment procedures, to allow for economies of scale, and&#13;
decentralized decision-making regarding procurement needs and regional participation in&#13;
bid selection committees, ensuring that the needs of the regions are met. The PCU will&#13;
assign, on an annual basis, a budget to each health region to procure pharmaceuticals and&#13;
supplies. The amount budgeted will be based on the size of the population covered by the&#13;
MSPBS. Every six months, each health region will determine its needs from a list of&#13;
essential drugs. Only medications and supplies included in a list of essential medications,&#13;
contraceptives, and medical supplies addressing local epidemiological needs will be&#13;
available to be purchased with the assigned budget. In order to ensure adequate access of&#13;
pharmaceuticals at the more peripheral facilities, semiannual orders for pharmaceuticals&#13;
will have to specify the amount to be assigned to each level of care.&#13;
6.16  The effectiveness of this arrangement to supply pharmaceuticals to project areas&#13;
will be reviewed after the first 18 months of operation. If procurement of pharmaceuticals&#13;
is severely delayed, compromising project implementation, alternate means will be&#13;
entertained, including contracting a reputable procurement agent.&#13;
6.17 Subcomponent I.C.: Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
(US$1.2 million). Health education activities are conducted by two Departments within&#13;
the MSPBS (the Direccion de Promoci6n, Prevencion y Educaci6n de la Salud and the&#13;
Direcci6n General de Participaci6n Comunitaria) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud, a&#13;
health training institute. There is little coordination among the two Departments and the&#13;
Institute and, with the exception of salaries, all rely completely on foreign assistance.&#13;
Their activities are varied, and lack focus and a systematic approach. However, they are&#13;
amply staffed. This subcomponent will: (a) educate the population in health promotion&#13;
emphasizing both self help activities and participation in MSPBS preventive health efforts;&#13;
(b) inform potential users regarding the availability of MSPBS services; and (c) enlist the&#13;
participation of the community in the delivery and management of health care services.&#13;
The project will finance an analysis of existing ethnographic and sociological information,&#13;
and existing educational materials to define the content of the media messages. Existing&#13;
information will be complemented by a series of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to be&#13;
conducted by an agency specialized in that technique. FGDs will be conducted to obtain&#13;
information regarding breastfeeding and weaning practices, child care and pregnancy care.&#13;
They will also examine attitudes and beliefs regarding disease prevention, family planning,&#13;
and health promotion. Material currently used by the MSPBS and other health providers&#13;
will be employed when appropriate. The project will also finance technical assistance for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the development of printed materials, as well as material for radio messages; the&#13;
transmission and distribution of those materials; and, transportation and per diem expenses&#13;
for outreach activities designed to inform the community, to identify potential CHWs, and&#13;
to organize events to obtain funding for CHWs.&#13;
6.18  Increasing community/household knowledge regarding good health practices will,&#13;
in the long run, reduce the need for curative care, and in the short run, increase demand&#13;
for preventive health services including prenatal care, family planning, immunization and&#13;
growth monitoring. Thus, care will be taken to transmit initially only those messages&#13;
promoting self-help preventive activities. Messages that would lead to an increased&#13;
demand for preventive health services would be transmitted only after most facilities in the&#13;
region have received the needed pharmaceuticals and equipment. The public would be&#13;
reached individually through counseling or small group talks at health facilities or in the&#13;
community, or through mass media, including radio and written materials (such as&#13;
materials explaining proper use of contraceptives, benefits of breastfeeding and&#13;
immunization, and oral rehydration salts).&#13;
6.19  The design, execution and analysis of the FGDs, the analysis of existing&#13;
information, the development of IEC materials and their reproduction will be&#13;
subcontracted to external firms or agencies. An Action Plan for the development and&#13;
dissemination of materials, including analyses of existent data, the content and&#13;
methodology for the FGDs, steps involved in the development of materials and a strategy&#13;
for their dissemination would be elaborated by a highly qualified (international) consultant.&#13;
The Action Plan would include terms of reference (TORs) for all separate activities to be&#13;
carried out by outside firms or agencies. A number of firms or agencies that could carry&#13;
out FGDs and the analysis of available information, and design IEC materials were&#13;
identified during preparation. The Direcci6n de Promoci6n y Educaci6n (DPE) of the&#13;
MSPBS and the PCU Technical Coordinator will work closely with the international&#13;
consultant in the development of the Action Plan, and with the firm or agency in the&#13;
implementation of the plan to ensure consistency with project objectives. The DPE will&#13;
participate in the selection of the subcontractors. The PCU will perform all contracting&#13;
procedures and will ensure compliance on the part of subcontractors. The PCU will&#13;
coordinate with the DPE and RCOs all activities related to the dissemination of materials&#13;
such as pamphlets, posters, organization of group talks and counseling services. The PCU&#13;
will make contracting arrangements for the transmission of mass media messages via&#13;
radio. An Action Plan for this subcomponent, acceptable to the Bank, would be&#13;
finalized before any of the other activities outlined in this subcomponent are&#13;
implemented.&#13;
6.20   Subcomponent I.D.: Training (US$1.0 million). Training for paramedical staff&#13;
in the MSPBS has employed a traditional format, i.e. a theoretical rather than practical&#13;
orientation, and with little participation and hands-on experience by trainees. This&#13;
subcomponent will improve the: (a) technical competence of MSPBS licensed nurses and&#13;
auxiliary nurses (including counseling techniques); (b) interpersonal skills of MSPBS staff,&#13;
(c) technical abilities of community midwives; (d) ability of CHWs to conduct health&#13;
education and the detection of community health problems; (e) operational capability of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
each facility; and, (f) specific skills needed for project implementation. A limited amount&#13;
of funds will be available for refresher courses for physicians and other specific needs&#13;
identified during implementation. Given the shortage of medical staff in certain areas, the&#13;
training of paramedical staff (licensed and auxiliary nurses) and community workers&#13;
(including midwives and CHWs) will be prioritized and strengthened to improve their&#13;
effectiveness. Approximately 80 percent of the funds allocated to training will finance&#13;
technical training for paramedical staff and community workers, and the enhancement of&#13;
operational capability. Technical training will also include community work techniques&#13;
and interpersonal skills strengthening. The other 20 percent of funds will finance training&#13;
for trainers and a fund to finance other training needs as they arise, including physician&#13;
training. The project will finance technical assistance for the assessment of staff&#13;
competence (including auxiliary nurses and community midwives), the design of training&#13;
materials, the design of an evaluation instrument, the development and production of&#13;
training materials, the design of a training monitoring and evaluation system, the design of&#13;
training for licensed nurses, the operational aspects of the operational capability&#13;
strengthening and a system to follow up and reinforce training. It will also provide travel&#13;
and per diems for the provision of training.&#13;
6.21   The project will introduce a competency-based training program to replace the&#13;
traditional methodology currently employed by the MSPBS. This program will be&#13;
established to train auxiliary nurses, community midwives and CHVWs. The first step in the&#13;
design of the training program is to review current job descriptions making the necessary&#13;
adaptations to make them realistic in terms of the amount and type of responsibilities each&#13;
post is assigned. The new job descriptions will be employed to assess the level of&#13;
competency of auxiliary nurses and community midwives. The competency of CHWs will&#13;
not be assessed as their skills are basic and their knowledge quite general. They will&#13;
receive a basic course tailored to project needs. The evaluation will be conducted on a&#13;
sample of auxiliaries and midwives staff The results of the evaluation will be employed to&#13;
develop competency-based training materials for the two target groups and a short&#13;
evaluation/placement instrument to assess the rest of the staff's level of competence to&#13;
place them at the appropriate level of training. A basic module will be developed for each&#13;
target group, containing material that will ensure competency at a level that will permit an&#13;
adequate performance of the functions of that position. Additional modules on specific&#13;
topics will be developed for each group to allow staff to reach higher levels of&#13;
competency. Once the basic module and the placement instrument are prepared, the staff's&#13;
competency will be assessed. Staff not demonstrating the needed competence to&#13;
adequately perform their functions will have to take the basic module first. Staff showing&#13;
basic competence will have the option of selecting two or three of the additional modules.&#13;
CHWs will receive a basic training module initially. Additional modules will be developed&#13;
after the third year of the project. Material to perform training follow-up will also be&#13;
prepared. Follow-up will take place during supervision visits. Licensed nurses will&#13;
receive refresher training courses to be delivered by the School of Nursing and individual&#13;
professionals.&#13;
6.22   The content of the training will emphasize worker competency in the treatment and&#13;
prevention of the key epidemiological problems of the area. Thus, training will emphasize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
the detection, proper referral and treatment of pregnancy and obstetric complications, safe&#13;
delivery, reproductive health (including both family planning and detection and treatment&#13;
of STDs), and detection and treatment of the key childhood diseases. Given frequent&#13;
complaints of the poor attitude on the part of MSPBS staff towards patients, training will&#13;
also include a module designed to improve staff's interpersonal skills. Training will&#13;
include counseling and community work techniques. The training itself will be conducted&#13;
in small, interactive groups, and through in-service training and follow-up.&#13;
6.23   Training will also seek to enhance the operational capability of service delivery&#13;
facilities. The operational capability of each facility will be strengthened through a&#13;
program which employs a system approach and emphasizes process, team work and has a&#13;
client focus. It seeks to improve the institution's image and staff attitudes, and to instill an&#13;
awareness of the need for change. Facility-level staff will be trained in problem&#13;
identification, solution development and local strategic planning and monitoring.&#13;
Managers will receive training on resource allocation, planning, monitoring, and&#13;
effectiveness. Facility staff would form multidisciplinary teams to identify and solve&#13;
specific facility-level operational problems employing data collected by the team. The&#13;
problems addressed would increase in complexity over time. The process itself would be&#13;
institutionalized to ensure improved operational capability at all levels of care. The project&#13;
will finance technical assistance to initiate the process, train local staff carry out the&#13;
process on their own, and travel and per diem to supervise the program. The MSPBS has&#13;
introduced this methodology in some facilities in the Cordillera health region with USAID&#13;
funding. The proposed project would introduce this methodology in participating health&#13;
regions.&#13;
6.24   Each health region will be assigned a budget for training based on the human&#13;
resources located in the region. In order to phase individual training within health regions&#13;
and give priority to staff who have the potential of benefiting the most and having the&#13;
most impact, staff members fulfilling pre-defined selection criteria will be trained first.&#13;
The criteria include: a record of active community work; positive attitude towards work;&#13;
working in areas where staff are more scarce. The regional director, in conjunction with&#13;
the RCO, will determine who will be prioritized. The actual training will be contracted&#13;
out initially and, as project execution advances, will be gradually transferred to the&#13;
MSPBS, giving MSPBS staff time to adopt the new training methodology. In the case of&#13;
training for the operational strengthening program, the process will begin at the regional&#13;
hospitals, gradually spreading to lower levels of care.&#13;
6.25   An Action Plan for the development of this component will be prepared by a highly&#13;
qualified specialist. It would include the detailed TOR for the competency-based training&#13;
methodology to be employed, including the evaluation of competency, preparation of&#13;
materials and the structure of the actual training. It would also outline the profile required&#13;
of firms/agencies that would need to be contracted to conduct some of the activities in this&#13;
subcomponent. The consultants will work closely with the PCU, the Direcci6n General de&#13;
Servicios de Salud (DGSS) and the Direcci6n General de Recursos Humanos (DGRH).&#13;
The DGSS and DGRH will participate in the selection of the contractor. Once the TOR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
are defined, one or more firms/agencies will be subcontracted to execute the evaluation&#13;
and design of training materials, and to work with MSPBS training staff to deliver the&#13;
material themselves. The training system will include follow-up procedures, training&#13;
evaluation (of both trainers and trainees) and the development of a training needs&#13;
assessment instrument. The PCU will perform all contracting procedures and will ensure&#13;
compliance on the part of subcontractors. It will coordinate with the DGSS, DGRH and&#13;
RCOs all activities related to the implementation of the training sessions. An Action Plan&#13;
for this subcomponent, acceptable to the Bank, would be finalized before any of the&#13;
other activities outlined in this subcomponent can be implemented.&#13;
Component II: Early Child Development Pilot (US$ 2.1 million, 8 percent of total&#13;
project costs).&#13;
6.26  The Early Child Development Pilot will test a strategy to improve the health and&#13;
psychosocial development of children between two and five years of age in poor areas of&#13;
Asunci6n. The pilot will (a) establish integrated early child development centers&#13;
(CEBINFAs); and (b) strengthen the DGBS' ability to supervise CEBINFA-delivered&#13;
services and provide technical assistance to communities to provide these services&#13;
themselves. The pilot will also give poor working mothers an affordable childcare&#13;
alternative. The project will finance the rehabilitation needs of up to 40 centers, technical&#13;
assistance, materials, furniture and equipment for the centers, educational materials,&#13;
caregiving training for mothers and management training for DGBS staff, and, through&#13;
counterpart funding, will cover operating costs of the CEBINFAs (food supplementation&#13;
for children and stipends for educators). Each CEBINFA will have access to a maximum&#13;
of US$5,000 for rehabilitation. Labor will be provided by the community. The pilot will&#13;
be implemented in Asunci6n, where the utility of CEBINFAs is greatest and they are&#13;
easiest to monitor.&#13;
6.27  CEBINFAs will provide the child with needed mental stimulation for a healthy&#13;
psychosocial development, three daily meals, and will ensure needed health interventions&#13;
including immunizations and a pre-enrollment physical through agreements with the local&#13;
health centers. In addition, mothers will receive health counseling when their child&#13;
becomes ill. Each center will accept a approximately 25 children, averaging about 8 to 10&#13;
children per educator. Two to three educators (mothers) will attend to the needs of the&#13;
twenty children and will rotate between themselves cooking and cleaning responsibilities.&#13;
The DGBS currently has seven CEBINFAs in operation. The first was established in&#13;
1991. In the past, the Government has covered operational costs. The DGBS is in the&#13;
process of establishing a methodology to assist the community to finance the operating&#13;
costs of the centers. Community funds are already covering some of the CEBINFAs'&#13;
operational costs. The project will assist in this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
6.28   CEBINFAs will be established in areas identified as being poor on the basis of the&#13;
1992 Census.23 (See Annex 4 for list a of neighborhoods classified as poor). Once the&#13;
location of the CEBINFA is selected, a cost-sharing agreement, acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
will be drafted between the MSPBS and the community outlining the proposed community&#13;
contribution to the installation and operation of the CEB1NFA. Once signed and&#13;
approved by the PCU, the DGBS and the Architecture Department of the MSPBS will&#13;
provide the necessary technical assistance for its installation. The PCU will provide funds&#13;
for rehabilitation, materials, equipment and training supplies. The DGBS will assist in the&#13;
identification and training of educator mothers. Educator mothers will be trained in early&#13;
stimulation techniques by specialists to be contracted by the PCU. They will also be&#13;
taught to detect childhood diseases, general hygiene concepts, to manage CEBINFA&#13;
resources, and to give educational talks. They will receive a stipend of at least US$125&#13;
per month derived from monthly payments made by parents for CEBINFA services (about&#13;
US$10 per month per child). To ensure adequate follow-up of child health needs,&#13;
cooperation agreements will be drafted with the corresponding health facility. These&#13;
agreements will be a pre-requisite for the installation of a CEBINFA. Ministry of&#13;
Education (MEC) staff will conduct the technical supervision of early stimulation&#13;
activities. DGBS will supervise other aspects of CEBINFA operations, visiting newly&#13;
established centers every two weeks for the first three months and on a monthly basis&#13;
thereafter. After three years of project implementation, DGBS will provide technical&#13;
assistance to community groups interested in establishing similar centers.&#13;
6.29   An evaluation of the CEBINFAs will be conducttd after the first 20 CEBINFAS&#13;
have been in operation for at least six months, or after the first 30 months of&#13;
implementation, whichever comes first. If the evaluation shows that CEBINFAs are&#13;
functioning properly and reaching their objectives, an additional 20 centers will be&#13;
established. The results of the evaluation will provide some of the needed inputs to&#13;
prepare a project to expand the CEBINFA model to other urban areas.&#13;
Component III: Strengthening Management for the Decentralization of Health&#13;
Services in Project Areas (US$1.2 million, 4 percent of total project costs).&#13;
6.30   The Government of Paraguay is in the process of defining the roles of&#13;
municipalities, departments and the state with regards to service provision in the context&#13;
of a decentralized operation of social services, including health. Given the lack of prior&#13;
experience in the management of programs at the regional level, the locus of much of the&#13;
proposed project's activities, this component seeks to strengthen the management&#13;
capability of health sector staff both at regional and central levels. This will improve&#13;
readiness for the eventual decentralization of health services and improve project&#13;
implementation. To improve management capability, the project would: (a) provide&#13;
training to strengthen the management capabilities of MSPBS staff at central and regional&#13;
levels, (b) establish management information systems to facilitate decision-making at the&#13;
23 The basic unsatisfied needs scale is heavily weighted by the access to water and sanitation indicator&#13;
and therefore lacked sufficient variability to be used as a poverty indicator. All neighborhoods&#13;
falling in the greatest need of education, categories (i.e. 4 and 5) were designated as poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
regional level, and project monitoring and implementation at both central and regional&#13;
levels; (c) conduct pilot activities to increase program sustainability; and (d) establish a&#13;
systematic supervision scheme for maternal and child health services in project areas.&#13;
6.31   The project will finance management training for central and regional staff. As&#13;
part of project management, the information system will be adapted to incorporate some&#13;
management information to be employed at central and regional levels and indicators to&#13;
monitor project implementation. Funds will be available for each region to submit&#13;
subprojects for management information systems and management training. This will&#13;
permit health regions to progress according to their own ability. The type of courses to be&#13;
financed are included in the Operations Manual, as are the specifications for the type of&#13;
equipment that would be financed. In order to ensure sufficient comparability of&#13;
informatioii systems to permit project monitoring, all regions will have to employ&#13;
compatible software and hardware, and employ the same indicators for project monitoring.&#13;
The PCU will develop a standard format to be filled out for the submission of subprojects,&#13;
and will provide technical assistance in the preparation of subprojects. Subproject&#13;
implementation will be monitored by the RCOs. Some training will be contracted out&#13;
centrally. Part of the management training will be contracted out to a firm or academic&#13;
institution with expertise in the field.&#13;
6.32  In order to improve program sustainability, several pilot studies will be financed.&#13;
The type of pilots to be tested will focus on cost recovery issues for health facilities, and&#13;
on developing incentives to encourage community participation in health care&#13;
management, to attract physicians to resource-poor areas, and to remunerate community&#13;
workers. A pilot to assess the feasibility of using community midwives to deliver births at&#13;
health posts will be developed. These will be developed after the second year of operation&#13;
when all other aspects of the project are well established. The project will finance&#13;
technical assistance for the design of the pilots.&#13;
6.33   This component will also finance the additional costs that a systematic supervision&#13;
of project services would entail, including travel and per diem for supervisors for site&#13;
visits. A strategy to supervise service delivery, i.e. ensure all inputs are in place, and&#13;
detect service delivery problems will be developed. It will also be employed to follow up&#13;
training sessions to ensure material retention. At present, most supervisory visits are&#13;
employed to gather data for record keeping and delivering materials and supplies.&#13;
7. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
7.1   Total project costs, excluding physical and price contingencies, are estimated at&#13;
US$27.1 million. In addition to the three components described above, total costs include&#13;
US$3.2 million (12 percent of project costs) for project management, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and US$0.45 million (2 percent of project costs) for the repayment of the&#13;
Project Preparation Advance. Total project costs, including physical and price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
contingencies, are estimated at US$3 1.2 million. Foreign exchange costs, local costs&#13;
excluding taxes, and duties and taxes amount to US$15.9 million (51 percent), US$14.0&#13;
million (45 percent) and US$1.3 million (4 percent) of total project costs, respectively.&#13;
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the estimated project costs by component and expenditure&#13;
account. Annex 5 provides further details on project costs.&#13;
7.2    Base Costs. Base costs are estimated at US$27.1 million and are expressed in July&#13;
1996 prices. Estimated costs of equipment, vehicles, and furniture were based on prices&#13;
of simnilar imported or locally available items. Estimated costs of civil works,&#13;
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, printed material, project operating costs, and&#13;
maintenance were based on recent price quotations, past experience, and expert opinion.&#13;
Costs for overseas and domestic consultant services and training were based on prevailing&#13;
rates for such services. Recurrent costs, excluding pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and&#13;
maintenance, were based on current MSPBS budget estimates.&#13;
7.3    Contingencies. Total contingencies amount to US$4.2 million (US$1.5 million&#13;
for physical contingencies and US$2.7 million for price contingencies), or 13 percent of&#13;
total project costs. Physical contingencies were applied to base costs as follows: 10&#13;
percent for civil works and 5 percent for all other items (consultant services, equipment,&#13;
printed material, vehicles, furniture, training, project operating costs, pharmaceuticals and&#13;
medical supplies, maintenance, and other recurrent costs). Price contingencies were based&#13;
on Bank estimates of foreign and local inflation rates.&#13;
7.4   Foreign Exchange. The foreign exchange component, which is estimated at&#13;
US$15.9 million or 51 percent of total project cost, is based on the following percentages&#13;
of base costs: (i) 100 percent for medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical&#13;
supplies, and international consultant contracts, (ii) 80 percent for non-medical equipment&#13;
and vehicles; (iii) 30 percent for printed materials and training; (iv) 20 percent for civil&#13;
works arnd furniture; and (v) 0 percent foi iocal consultant contracts, project operating&#13;
costs, maintenance and other recurrent costs.&#13;
7.5   Taxes and Duties. Local taxes and duties amount to approximately US$1.3&#13;
million or 4 percent of total project costs. Locally procured goods and services are&#13;
subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 10 percent, excluding pharmaceuticals and medical&#13;
equipment and supplies. Import duties for computers are about 6 percent, 10 percent for&#13;
vehicles, 30 percent for furniture, and, on average, 10 percent for non-medical equipment.&#13;
Duties on pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies are zero.&#13;
B. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
7.6   The proposed project would be financed by two Bank loans for a total of US$21.8&#13;
million, representing 70 percent of total project costs (refer to Table 6 for details of&#13;
financing plan). Bank financing would cover 71 percent of foreign exchange expenditures&#13;
and 75 percent of local currency expenditures net of duties and taxes. Contributions from&#13;
communities for the operation of CEBINFAs would amount to US$0.8 million, or three&#13;
percent of project costs. The Government of Paraguay would finance the remaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
US$8.6 million, which includes US$1.3 million in duties and taxes. The Government's&#13;
financing of foreign exchange expenditures (US$4.6 million) is for the foreign exchange&#13;
component of recurrent expenditures (particularly drugs and medical supplies) for which&#13;
the share financed by the Bank gradually declines to 20 percent by the end of the project.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were sought from the Government on the overall amount,&#13;
budgeting and disbursement mechanisms to ensure timely provision of counterpart&#13;
resources. The actual disbursement of counterpart funds would be confirmed through the&#13;
annual independent audits (para. 8.20) and monitored on an on-going basis with support&#13;
from the Bank's Facilitating Office in Asuncion.&#13;

7.7    One loan for a total of US$10.9 million would be in Currency Pool Loan (CPL)&#13;
terms and the second loan for a total of US$10.9 million would be in fixed-rate US-&#13;
Dollar-based Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms. Both loans would be disbursed at equal&#13;
rates over the expected disbursement period of six years. The SCL would be repayable in&#13;
15 years. Each semester's aggregate disbursements (Disbursed Amount) would have a&#13;
grace period of three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate ffxing date of&#13;
that Disbursed Amount. The CPL would have a grace period of five years, a final&#13;
maturity of 17 years and level repayment of principal. The Borrower has selected both a&#13;
US-Dollar SCL and CPL in order to improve the management of its external liabilities and&#13;
reduce risks. The combination of Dollar-based SCL and CPL terms reduces the risk from&#13;
the non-US-Dollar components of the CPL. The choice of having the bulk of financing in&#13;
US Dollars reflects the importance of US-Dollar based contracts in Paraguay's&#13;
international trade and Treasury receipts. The Government has selected a fixed-rate SCL&#13;
to ensure stability of debt-service payments.&#13;

C. RECURRENT COSTS AND PROJEC. SUSTAINABILIlIY&#13;
7.8    Recurrent costs related to project execution and incorporated within the financing&#13;
plan include: (a) drugs and medical supplies (US$7 6 million, including contingencies); (b)&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure and equipment (US$2.6 million, including contingencies);&#13;
(c) operating costs for early child development centers (US$1.8 million, including&#13;
contingencies). Additional annual recurrent expenditures at the end of the project are&#13;
estimated at about US$1.2 million in 1996 prices. Drugs and supplies, and maintenance&#13;
expenditures would be financed by the Bank on a declining basis from 80 percent in the&#13;
first two years of implementation to 20 percent in the last two years. All other items&#13;
would be covered by the counterpart financing requirements of the project.&#13;

8. PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS&#13;
A. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
8.1   The Bank will finance approximately 70 percent (US$21.8 million) of the total&#13;
project cost of US$31.2 million equivalent. The loan funds will finance civil works,&#13;
goods, consultant's services, maintenance of equipment and infrastructure, and some&#13;
operational costs. Procurement procedures to be established for this project will follow&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995, as revised in 1996). During appraisal the Bank&#13;
carried out a detailed review of procedures and documents in use in Paraguay. Some&#13;
discrepancies between Bank and local procurement practices were identified in a review&#13;
conducted in 1992 by the Bank. These have been resolved by using standard documents,&#13;
and ensuring that the Loan Agreements contain specific mention of each item for the&#13;
procurement of civil works, goods and/or consulting services (see Annex 6 for specific&#13;
procurement provisions for Paraguay).&#13;
8.2   The project design nrovides for a combination of centralized and decentralized&#13;
implementation mechanisms. Most drugs and medical supplies, some of the goods&#13;
(namely medical equipment), and most technical assistance will be procured centrally by&#13;
the PCU. Civil works and some goods and consulting services will be procured by each of&#13;
the RCOs at the regional level through NCB, international and national shopping. RCOs&#13;
would be monitored and audited by the PCU. In the case of health regions having limited&#13;
procurement capability, the PCU (the Coordinator for Investments and the Procurement&#13;
Specialist) will provide administrative and technical support to the RCOs and facilities to&#13;
procure those works, goods and services centrally, but with representation from the health&#13;
regions in all procedures, both to train local staff and to ensure local needs are taken into&#13;
account. In the case of civil works, the RCO and relevant regional staff will prepare, with&#13;
technical assistance from the PCU, the technical documentation (technical specifications&#13;
and draft bidding documents). The Coordinator for Investments has received training on&#13;
Bank procurement procedures and has ample experience in procurement for civil works&#13;
and medical equipment. RCO Coordinators will receive ample training on procurement&#13;
for civil works including procedural and technical aspects. The Operational Manual will&#13;
contain a detailed description of the procedures to be followed at every step.&#13;
8.3   Bid evaluation commissions for decentralized procurement will include the&#13;
regional director, the facility director, a representative of the Regional Health Council (the&#13;
Health Secretary), the RCO, and a representative from the bidding department of the&#13;
central MSPBS. In the case of centralized procurement, as will be the case with the&#13;
purchase of pharmaceuticals and most medical equipment, the PCU will ensure that the&#13;
health regions involved have majority representation in the bidding commissions and that&#13;
they have participation in the preparation of the technical specifications of the bidding&#13;
documents. Bid evaluation commissions for centralized procurement will include the&#13;
regional director, a representative of the Regional Health Council (the Health Secretary),&#13;
and the RCO for each of the regions involved in the particular bidding process, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
representative of the PCU, and a representative from the bidding department of the central&#13;
MSPBS.&#13;
8.4   Civil Works. The civil works to be carried out involve the rehabilitation of health&#13;
centers and regional hospitals in six health regions and the rehabilitation of CEBINFAs in&#13;
Asunci6n. The total estimated cost of the civil works component is about US$6.0 million&#13;
(Table 7), out of which approximately US$5.2 million equivalent (or 86 percent of the&#13;
total cost) will be financed by the Bank. Civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis&#13;
of National Competitive Bidding (NCB), with the average contract estimated at&#13;
US$120,000 equivalent and none expected to exceed US$200,000. Small works&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$0.8 million equivalent&#13;
may be procured under fixed-price lump-sum contracts awarded on the basis of a&#13;
comparison of at least three quotations from qualified suppliers (see Table 8 for a&#13;
summary of procurement arrangements).&#13;
8.5   Goods and Equipment. Goods to be financed under the project will include: (i)&#13;
medical and industrial equipment; (ii) computer hardware and software, and&#13;
communications equipment; (iii) printed material; (iv) other goods and furniture, and (v)&#13;
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies (see para. 8.9). The total estimated cost of these&#13;
goods is about US$13.6 million equivalent, with US$9.2 million (or 68 percent) to be&#13;
financed by the Bank.&#13;
8.6   Under current arrangements it is estimated that medical and industrial equipment&#13;
(estimated to cost US$3.6 million equivalent) will be procured through international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB). Where possible, packages for several subprojects would be&#13;
consolidated into larger packages by the PCU. Given that it will not always be possible to&#13;
consolidate regional packages into larger packages and that some items have limited&#13;
suppliers some of this equipment will be purchased through Limited International Bidding&#13;
(LIB) (estimated to cost US$0.7 million). A minimal amount will be procured through&#13;
international shopping (estimated to cost US$0.4 million). Only equipment included in a&#13;
pre-approved list of medical and industrial equipment can be procured through the project.&#13;
Procurement of medical and industrial equipment would employ centralized bidding and&#13;
payment procedures, and decentralized decision-making regarding procurement needs.&#13;
Bid evaluation commissions would have regional participation, ensuring that the needs of&#13;
the regions are met.&#13;
8.7   Communications and computer equipment, for an estimated amount of US$0.9&#13;
million, will be procured through LIB (up to an estimated cost of US$0.7 million) and&#13;
international shopping (up to an estimated cost of US$0.2 million). This equipment will&#13;
be purchased in small packages, and at varying times, depending on the needs of each of&#13;
the regions and facilities. When feasible, packages would be consolidated into larger&#13;
packages by the PCU and procured through LIB.&#13;
8.8   Printed materials for the Information, Education and Communication activities&#13;
(IEC) and training (several contracts estimated to cost US$0.8 million in the aggregate)&#13;
would be purchased through NCB. Other printed material, other equipment and furniture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
to be procured in packages estimated not to exceed individual amounts of US$25,000 and&#13;
US$0.5 million in the aggregate would be procured through national shopping.&#13;
8.9   Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies. To minimize pharmaceutical supply&#13;
problems, procurement would employ centralized bidding and payment procedures, to&#13;
allow for economies of scale, and decentralized decision-making regarding procurement&#13;
needs and regional participation in bid selection committees, ensuring that the needs of the&#13;
regions are met. Drugs and medical supplies will be procured through ICB on a semi-&#13;
annual basis to make the necessary adjustments to changes in demand and to avoid&#13;
overstocking on pharmaceuticals with short expiration periods. ICB is considered the&#13;
most appropriate procurement method because only basic pharmaceuticals and medical&#13;
supplies will be purchased, all of which are available generically and have multiple&#13;
suppliers. Product quality will be assured through the technical specifications included in&#13;
the bidding documents. The total cost of these goods is estimated at about US$7.5 million&#13;
equivalent, out of which the Bank would finance 50 percent (approximately US$3.8&#13;
million). In order to permit the health regions to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical&#13;
supplies in emergency situations, some drugs and medical supplies may be procured by&#13;
each of the six health regions on the basis of national shopping for individual contracts not&#13;
to exceed US$25,000 equivalent and up to an amount equivalent to US$0.5 million in the&#13;
aggregate (approximately US$80,000 equivalent for each of the six health regions) during&#13;
the project's life. All requests for purchases of drugs and medical supplies will be&#13;
prepared by each of the health regions on the basis of a list of pre-approved items.&#13;
Bidding specifications will include delivery to the regions. The PCU will aggregate the&#13;
requests for each item and proceed with the agreed procurement steps. For all purchases&#13;
through ICB, the Bank would clear the final list containing the description, quantities and&#13;
destination of these items.&#13;
8.10   Consultant's Services. Consultant's services to be financed under the proposed&#13;
loans will be for the design of materials for IEC and training, the training evaluation,&#13;
design and analysis of Focus Group Discussions (FGD), the health network analysis;&#13;
institutional and operational strengthening; and for training, when these services need to&#13;
be contracted out. Also included under consultant's services are staff costs for project&#13;
management staff, including key PCU and RCO personnel. These shall be carried out by&#13;
individual consultants or consulting firms, contracted in accordance with Guidelines on&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981). A standard invitation package would be used, including the&#13;
Bank's standard forms of contract for consultants services and the model letter of&#13;
invitation. The estimated cost of these components is about US$4.7 million equivalent, all&#13;
of which would be financed under the proposed loans (100 percent).&#13;
8.11   Operational Expenses. Project operating costs to be financed under the&#13;
proposed loans cover travel expenses for supervision, office supplies, telephone, and other&#13;
recurrent items. The total cost is estimated at US$0.3 million out of which $0.15 million,&#13;
or 50 percent, will be financed by the loans. Only office supplies will involve&#13;
procurement, which would be carried out on the basis of comparison of price quotations&#13;
from at least three eligible suppliers.&#13;

8.12   Other Costs Not Involving Procurement. Approximately 18 percent of the&#13;
proposed project costs, or approximately US$5.5 million equivalent, would not involve&#13;
procurement. Of this amount, the Bank would finance US$1.9 million. These costs&#13;
include maintenance costs of equipment and infrastructure, training and other recurrent&#13;
costs. Training costs include only travel and per diems for trainers and trainees. Fees for&#13;
trainers are included in consultant's services and training materials are included under&#13;
goods. Maintenance costs for a total amount of US$2.6 million will be financed by the&#13;
loans on a declining basis. A total of US$1.0 million equivalent (or 40 percent on&#13;
average) will be financed under the loans.&#13;
8.13   Review of Procurement. Prior review by the Bank will be carried out for: (a)&#13;
procurement procedures and documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB&#13;
and LIB; (b) the first package for NCB for each civil works and goods for each health&#13;
region _c  calendar year, and all those estimated to cost US$150,000 or above, in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
case of civil works; and (c) all consulting services contracts (and selection processes),&#13;
except as noted in Table 9. It is expected that prior review limits for civil works will result&#13;
in an annual review of a maximum of 12 contracts. In the case of consultant's services, a&#13;
maximum of 8 consultant's services contracts will be subject to prior review throughout&#13;
the lifetime of the project. Standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank will be&#13;
used for all NCB procurement. The Bank will review ex-post, on a selective basis,&#13;
contracts and bid evaluations for goods and civil works awarded under NCB and shopping&#13;
not subject to prior review by the Bank. It is estimated that under current arrangements&#13;
about 48 percent of the contracts representing 62 percent of the project cost, or&#13;
approximately US$18.0 million equivalent, will be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;

B. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
8.14 The proceeds of the proposed loans are expected to be disbursed in accordance&#13;
with the schedule shown in Table 10 over a period of six years (i.e. seven IBRD fiscal&#13;
years). The project completion date is estimated to be December 31, 2002, and the Loan&#13;
Closing Dates would be June 30, 2003.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
8.16  Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
against expenditures for contracts for: (a) all civil works below US$150,000 equivalent;&#13;
(b) contracts of less than US$40,000 and US$20,000 for the employment of consulting&#13;
firms and individual consultants, respectively; (c) contracts for goods of less than&#13;
US$250,000, with the exception of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for contracts for&#13;
goods less than US$25,000, and contracts less than US$50,000 in the case of medical and&#13;
industrial equipment; and (d) disbursements against expenditures not undertaken by&#13;
contract. Supporting documentation for these would be retained and appropriately&#13;
maintained by the Coordinating Unit and would be available for periodic review by the&#13;
Bank. Withdrawal applications for all other contracts will be supported by full&#13;
documentation.&#13;
8.17  The Project Coordinating Unit will be responsible for ensuring that requests for&#13;
reimbursement are made for eligible expenditures. These requests can only be made when&#13;
the PCU has incurred the expense and has sufficient supporting documentation (contracts,&#13;
invoices and payment orders). The PCU will prepare appropriate documentation as&#13;
required by the Bank at regular intervals (monthly) and present it to the Bank for&#13;
reimbursement.&#13;
8.18  Special Account. A Special Account in US dollars will be opened in the Central&#13;
Bank of Paraguay, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation to this account would be US$1 million, which is equal to the average of four&#13;
months' eligible expenditures (net of anticipated direct payments). An initial deposit of up&#13;
to US$500,000 will be made available, and the full amount of the authorized allocation&#13;
will be released when disbursements reach a level of US$5.0 million. Funds from the&#13;
account will finance only the Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The Bank will&#13;
replenish the Special Account as requested upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that&#13;
expenditures paid were eligible for financing out of the account. Normal documentation&#13;
requirements apply, except that, in addition, a copy of the Bank statement from the&#13;
institution holding the account detailing the transactions made would accompany each&#13;
replenishment request.&#13;
C. AUDITS&#13;
8.19  Accounts and Audits. All executing agencies would maintain records and&#13;
accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources&#13;
and expenditures in connection with the execution of the project. Agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations that the MSPBS would: (i) have the records and accounts for each&#13;
fiscal year audited by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank, with a&#13;
separate opinion provided for SOEs, with generally accepted auditing standards and&#13;
procedures; (ii) furnish the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,&#13;
a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other&#13;
information concerning the records and accounts as the Bank would from time to time&#13;
reasonably request. For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
Accounts were made on the basis of SOEs, and all expenditures with respect to which&#13;
withdrawals were made from the Special Account, the coordinating units for the project&#13;
would provide to MSPBS upon request all records and accounts necessary to allow the&#13;
timely performance of its obligations, and to the independent auditor, both the records and&#13;
the supporting documentation.&#13;
8.20  The project's accounts would be available for inspection by the Bank. The annual&#13;
audit reports would include, inter alia: (a) an audit of the project; (b) an auditor's opinion&#13;
on the eligibility of expenses submitted through SOEs; (c) opinions on compliance with&#13;
the financial-managerial covenants in the Loan Agreements; (d) an audit of the special&#13;
account, (e) a management letter; and (f) a disclosure of the audit procedures utilized.&#13;
The terms of reference for the annual audits were agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
9. PROJECT MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
9.1   The proposed project was identified in February 1994. The current design of the&#13;
project was defined in the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) issued in October&#13;
1994 prepared jointly with MSPBS staff. Project preparation began at that time. A&#13;
Project Preparation Unit (PPU), which reports directly to the Minister, was established&#13;
within the MSPBS. The preparation team consisted of MSPBS professional staff. All&#13;
preparation work involved frequent consultation with regional staff and the key service&#13;
departments within the MSPBS. Project preparation has been closely coordinated with a&#13;
similar project being prepared by the IDB for neighboring health regions.&#13;
9.2   Preparation has been supported through a PHRD Japanese Grant to finance project&#13;
development in the social sectors in Paraguay, along with a US$450,000 advance from the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Portuguese Trust Funds in the amount of US$55,000&#13;
were also employed. Key activities have included: (a) training of PPU staff in Bank&#13;
procedures including procurement and disbursement; (b) regional study trips to observe&#13;
other Bank projects, (c) technical assistance in the design and preparation of key project&#13;
components; (d) assessments of physical health infrastructure and equipment needs; and,&#13;
purchase of equipment and supplies for the PPU.&#13;
B. INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
9.3   Institutional Responsibilities. The executing agency for the proposed project is&#13;
the MSPBS through a project coordination unit (PCU) reporting directly to the Minister&#13;
and the General Directorate of Projects with International Cooperation (OPCI). The PCU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
will coordinate directly with the General Directorates within the Ministry and the Regional&#13;
Directorates. Each Regional Directorate will have a Regional Coordination Office (RCO)&#13;
staffed with one regional project coordinator with a professional profile, functions and&#13;
responsibilities as established in Annex 7, satisfactory to the Bank. The main executors of&#13;
the project are the health regions, with the support of the General Directorates at the&#13;
central level. As a condition of negotiations, the MSPBS passed a ministerial resolution&#13;
defining the PCU's organizational structure and responsibilities (including key posts and&#13;
the RCOs), its position within the MSPBS' organizational structure, and its reporting&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
9.4   Lending Arrangements. The Loans would be made to the Republic of Paraguay.&#13;
Through the Annual Budget Law passed in December of each year, the MSPBS would&#13;
have access to the proceeds of the Loans. All resources would be managed centrally&#13;
through the PCU, but resource allocation decisions would be made at the regional level&#13;
for those aspects of the project that would be carried out in the regions. Each region&#13;
would be allocated a specific budget for project implementation depending on needs&#13;
determined in the annual implementation plan. The health region's use of project funds&#13;
will be accountable to the MSPBS.&#13;
9.5   Project Administration. The project would be administered by the PCU and&#13;
RCOs in the participating health regions. In addition to the Project Director, the PCU will&#13;
have 3 coordinators who would divide responsibilities as follows: (a) administration-&#13;
finances; (b) civil works, equipment, and maintenance; and (c) training, IEC, management&#13;
support and early child development. Procurement of pharmaceuticals would be carried&#13;
out by the Procurement Specialist under the supervision of the Technical Coordinator.&#13;
Each of these coordinators would be supported by two or three assistants. RCO&#13;
coordinators would be supported by one assistant. A diagram of the structure of the PCU&#13;
and the profile and functions of the four key positions within the PCU and the&#13;
coordinators for the RCOs are contained in Annex 7. The PCU is in charge of overall&#13;
coordination, planning, logistical support and supervision of the project, ensuring&#13;
execution is carried out in accordance with established guidelines, procedures and targets.&#13;
Together with the RCOs, it will also provide technical assistance to regional staff in the&#13;
preparation of bidding documents and annual investment plans (including infrastructure,&#13;
equipment and training). The RCOs will also be actively involved in the supervision of&#13;
project activities at the local level.&#13;
9.6   The Operational Manual sets forth the functions and structure of the PCU, TORs&#13;
for the director, the three key PCU positions and for the regional coordinators,&#13;
administrative and financial procedures, procurement arrangements and plans, and&#13;
reporting and auditing requirements. During appraisal, the Government agreed that the&#13;
four key posts in the PCU would be filled through a competitive process using the profile&#13;
and functions agreed with the Bank. In order to build project management capacity early&#13;
on, it was agreed that a project director would be selected and contracted prior to&#13;
negotiations, and that the selection and hiring of the three key coordinators would be a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness. The contracting of two RCO coordinators is also a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
PCU and RCO's would be staffed with high-caliber personnel satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
throughout the life of the project.&#13;
9.7   Implementation. A Project Implementation Plan was prepared as part of project&#13;
preparation and its contents are contained in the Operational Manual. The Operational&#13;
Manual specifies the objectives, activities, institutional arrangements, monitoring&#13;
indicators and implementation targets for each project component. An annex in the&#13;
Operational Manual contains a summary of the Technical and Operational Guidelines for&#13;
the services to be delivered at health centers and posts under the project. At present the&#13;
MSPBS has separate booklets defining service norms for many of its programs. Many&#13;
norms are not complied with because they are outdated or unreasonably strict. Moreover,&#13;
the volume of material that needs to be mastered discourages compliance. The MSPBS'&#13;
service norms were reviewed, updated and prioritized as part of project preparation, and&#13;
are contained in the Technical and Operational Guidelines annex in the Operational&#13;
Manual. Another annex contains a mini-operational manual for CEBINFAs. A detailed&#13;
outline of its contents was provided as a condition of negotiations. A draft version of the&#13;
Operational Manual was reviewed during appraisal and a final version satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank was presented prior to negotiations. Assurances were obtained during negotiations&#13;
that no changes would be made to the Operational Manual without prior Bank&#13;
consultation. The MSPBS' approval of the Operational Manual, containing the final&#13;
version of the Technical and Operational Service Delivery Guidelines annex is a condition&#13;
of effectiveness. To allow for adjustments in project implementation, the PCU would be&#13;
responsible for the preparation of an Annual Implementation Plan (Plan Operativo Anual),&#13;
employing a format to be agreed upon prior to negotiations (refer to para. 9.13).&#13;
9.8   In order to prepare timely inputs to the Annual Budget Law, subproject&#13;
preparation will have to adhere to a strict schedule. Facilities will prepare subprojects,&#13;
with technical assistance when required, and submit them to RCOs for review at the&#13;
beginning of the calendar year. The RCOs will review subprojects and send them to the&#13;
PCU for review by March 31 st. The PCU will review subprojects to ensure that they&#13;
comply with the MIP and its eligibility criteria and consolidate all requests to prepare a&#13;
draft of the investment portion of the annual implementation plan for the Bank's&#13;
consideration no later than June 30 of each year, and in this way ensure that the required&#13;
amounts will be included in the Annual Budget Law by July 31 st. The consolidated&#13;
requests will form the basis of the Annual Implementation Plan for the following calendar&#13;
year, which will be furnished to the Bank no later than January 31 of each year.&#13;
9.9   An Administrative and Procurement Review would be held in Washington during&#13;
the second year of project execution between PCU, Government and Bank staff to review&#13;
the legal, procurement and administrative aspects of project implementation. This review&#13;
process would assess the experience with procurement arrangements, discuss the findings&#13;
of the first independent financial and physical audits, and analyze the project's&#13;
disbursement profile and arrangements, including counterpart funds. Agreement on the&#13;
scope and timing of this review was reached at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
9.10  Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a&#13;
period of six years, beginning on January 1, 1997, and ending by December 31, 2002. The&#13;
Closing Date would be June 30, 2003. The cost schedules for the various components&#13;
(Annex 4) and the annual work programs would be the basis for project implementation&#13;
planning.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
9.11   Bank Supervision. The proposed project would require approximately 23 staff&#13;
weeks of supervision per year. A supervision plan is presented in Annex 9. A Project&#13;
Launch Workshop would be held close to the date of project effectiveness to ensure all&#13;
operational procedures are in place, present the final outlines of the proposed project to&#13;
key stakeholders in health and the general public, and confirm the arrangements and&#13;
activities presented in the first year Annual Implementation Plan. The Bank would carry&#13;
out at least two supervision missions per year as well as a Mid-Term Review. Supervision&#13;
missions would be timed to coincide with the Annual Reviews (see below) and the Mid-&#13;
Term Review.&#13;
9.12 Annual Review and Implementation Plan. Annual reviews of project&#13;
implementation progress would include the participation of PCU and RCO staff, regional&#13;
directors and Bank staff. The preparation of the Annual Progress Report and Annual&#13;
Implementation Plan (para 9.14) to be discussed during the annual reviews are the&#13;
responsibility of the PCU. The Annual Reports would include: (a) an analysis of the&#13;
previous year's performance regarding its fulfillment of the approved annual&#13;
implementation plan; (b) a quantitative analysis of project performance employing&#13;
monitoring indicators identified during appraisal; (c) identification of areas in which&#13;
implementation has failed to achieve expected targets and a discussion of the reasons for&#13;
this failure; (d) identification of areas requiring greater attention in the near future; (e) an&#13;
assessment of the effectiveness of cooperation with other agencies and programs related&#13;
to the project; (f) a financial report, including a summary of expenditures, analysis of the&#13;
financial management of the project and availability of counterpart funds; (g) a&#13;
procurement report, including completion of the procurement plan and identification of&#13;
any issues regarding procurement arrangements; (h) an analysis of PCU and RCO&#13;
performance, and (i) recommendations for future actions.&#13;
9.13   The Annual Implementation Plan would contain: (a) a description of activities and&#13;
implementation targets on a quarterly basis for each component and subcomponent of the&#13;
project; (b) estimated costs of the above mentioned activities disaggregated by category of&#13;
expenditure and source of financing; (c) identification of critical dates for specific&#13;
activities; (d) areas of cooperation with other MSPBS programs and outside entities; (e)&#13;
revised disbursement estimate and quarterly budget by source and use of funds; and (f) the&#13;
annual procurement schedule. A draft of the Annual Implementation Plan for the first year&#13;
of project implementation was presented during negotiations. The presentation of the&#13;
revised version is a condition of effectiveness. The PCU is also responsible for the timely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
contracting of project impact evaluation studies, and the preparation of an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report that would be submitted to the Bnlk no later than six months after the&#13;
closing date of the loans. Agreement was reached dv' uin, negotiations that the MSPBS&#13;
would furnish the Bank an Annual Report no Sate,r haln e½izry 28 and Annual&#13;
Implementation Plan no later than January 3 1 of e-achi year, and that a Joint Annual Review&#13;
would be held with the Bank no later than March of each year&#13;
9.14  Mid-Term Review. The Government agreed during negotiations that a joint&#13;
Bank-Government Mid-Term Review would be held during the Annual Review to be held&#13;
in March of the year 2000. The Mid-Term Review would evaluate, among other things:&#13;
(a) progress in the completion of the critical project stages defined in the implementation&#13;
plan; (b) the degree to which project objectives are being met; (c) compliance with the&#13;
Loan Agreements' legal covenants; (d) adequacy of available and programmed financing;&#13;
(e) compliance with procurement and disbursement arrangements; and, (e) results of&#13;
annual project audits. The MSPBS would furnish the Bank a Mid-Term Review Report&#13;
one month prior to the date of the Review.&#13;
9. 15  Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU is responsible for the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the project. Periodic supervision visits will be made by project staff to&#13;
the field (para 6.33). Process and impact indicatofs have been defined for the project and&#13;
will be monitored throughout implementation (Annex 8 contains a summary of key&#13;
project performance indicators agreed upon during appraisal). Given serious&#13;
underreporting of vital statistics and the unreliability of service statistics to measure&#13;
project outcomes, the evaluation of the project's impact will employ survey data. A&#13;
national maternal and child health survey was conducted in lanuary 1996 by the Centers&#13;
for Disease Control (CDC) and CEPEP which will yield baseline information. Although&#13;
the national survey employs a very large sample, it is not representative at the regional&#13;
level. However, it does permit regional comparisons and provide regional estimates of&#13;
key maternal and child health and service indicators. T lhe project would finance a re-&#13;
analysis of data from the 1996 survey as baseline information, and would finance a survey&#13;
employing the same instrument in project areas to obtain endline measures at the&#13;
beginning of the fifth year of the project. The survey design and execution would be&#13;
contracted out to a firm or agency specializing in data collection and analysis. Ideally, one&#13;
would want regional-level baseline data, but given the cost it would imply, and the&#13;
availability of the CDC-CEPEP survey, this was deemed unnecessary.&#13;
10. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
10.1  The proposed project does not present any significant environmental risks. It has&#13;
been assigned a "C" environmental rating. It will, however, generate a favorable&#13;
environmental impact through (a) increased household information regarding general&#13;
hygiene and waste disposal; (b) and improved waste disposal at regional hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
11. POVERTY AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVE&#13;
CATEGORIES&#13;
11.1  The project is in the Poverty Reduction and Human Resource Development&#13;
Category and is a program of targeted interventions. Although the project will not reduce&#13;
poverty per se, it is expected to reduce the burden of disease in population groups which&#13;
currently carry a disproportionate burden of disease in the country due to their income&#13;
level and the Government's low levels of investment in those regions. It targets six of the&#13;
most impoverished departments and the low income areas of Asunci6n, also identified as&#13;
containing a significant proportion of the low income population. The six departments&#13;
contain a large proportion of the indigenous and recent migrant population, considered&#13;
among the most vulnerable groups in Paraguay. The Child Development Pilot will target&#13;
low income areas within Asunci6n.&#13;
12. PARTICIPATORY APPROACH&#13;
12.1  Several meetings were held during project preparation with key regional staff&#13;
including regional MSPBS directors, Departmental Health Secretaries, hospital directors,&#13;
and head nurses both to discuss with them the details of project design and activities, and&#13;
to obtain feedback regarding its design and implementation. Regional views and&#13;
suggestions were incorporated into the project design. These consultations strengthened&#13;
the support for the project at the regional level and helped clarify implementation issues.&#13;
A short survey of users and non-users of MSPBS services was also conducted to&#13;
determine beneficiary perceptions of the quality of services provided, accessibility of&#13;
services, attitudes of health staff and service costs. The results of the survey confirmed&#13;
information obtained informally through interviews with MSPBS staff and other health&#13;
providers. In addition, Bank staff conducted in-depth interviews with the head nurse and&#13;
reproductive health nurse in three of the regional hospitals and two health centers to&#13;
determine what regional staff identify as being the main obstacles to service delivery in&#13;
their area.&#13;
13. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. EXPECTED PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
13.1  The main medium-term benefit of the project would be the improvement of the&#13;
health of women and children in project areas through direct interventions designed to&#13;
improve the quality and quantity of care provided and through an increased emphasis on&#13;
preventive care in MSPBS services. Other benefits include: (a) an increase in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
population's general awareness and information regarding preventive care, health&#13;
promotion and good health practices; (b) strengthened regional health authority and&#13;
facility management and implementation capability; (c) savings of close to US$0.5 million&#13;
per year in resources currently employed to treat complications of induced abortion; (d)&#13;
the field testing of a pilot to increase access to early child development programs before it&#13;
is expanded to other regions; (e) field testing of pilots to improve health service&#13;
sustainability; (f) increased access to early stimulation programs for poor urban children;&#13;
(g) increased child care options for low-income mothers; and (h) a strengthened&#13;
collaboration with the community and NGOs to improve service delivery.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
13.2  Paraguay's cause of death structure characterizes it as being in a mid-&#13;
epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious diseases and chronic/degenerative&#13;
diseases being among the top five killers. Infectious diseases, including upper respiratory&#13;
tract infections and diarrheal disease, are included among the main causes of death of the&#13;
population as a whole, along with cardiovascular disease, neoplasms and accidents. Death&#13;
from perinatal causes (birth lesions, infections and neonatal tetanus) is also significant.&#13;
And, maternal mortality is the highest in the region. Infectious diseases, perinatal and&#13;
maternal death are all characteristic of contexts with high fertility (young population) and&#13;
poor health delivery capability. And, all are amenable to effective, low-cost interventions&#13;
with short-term results. Institutional interventions designed to improve the quality and&#13;
coverage of prenatal and delivery care, child immunization, and family planning services,&#13;
combined with individual household level interventions designed to improve health&#13;
practices in the home and the community can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality&#13;
due to the above mentioned causes. Although inducing behavior change is sometimes&#13;
more costly than a highly specific and effective interventions such as immunization, it is a&#13;
necessary element of long-term, sustainable change. While the health of the population&#13;
can be also be enhanced through improvements in overall educational attainment, socio-&#13;
economic development, and the environment, they are more costly interventions and have&#13;
a less immediate effect.&#13;
13.3   Many activities financed under the proposed project do not lend themselves to&#13;
quantitative economic analysis. And, those that would in other circumstances, are difficult&#13;
to measure because of the dearth of reliable Paraguayan data on health indicators, service&#13;
availability and quality, health expenditures and costs. However, the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
most of the interventions to be financed by the project has been quantified in many other&#13;
contexts. Prenatal and delivery care, and family planning, for example, have been shown&#13;
to be highly cost-effective in other countries. According to the findings of the 1993 World&#13;
Development Report, Investing in Health, the annual cost per participant of prenatal and&#13;
delivery care in low income countries is US$90. The annual cost per user of family&#13;
planning services is US$12. Child health interventions were estimated to cost US$9 per&#13;
participant and treatment of minor trauma for all ages up to US$6 per participant. Thus,&#13;
the annual cost per participant for this package of services comes to US$117 per user.&#13;
This same package, including health education, which was not costed per participant, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
estimated to cost US$12 per capita. The estimated per capita cost of providing these&#13;
services within the Project comes to US$8.70, well below the estimated average. Costs&#13;
are low given the reliance on health care personnel other than doctors (nurses and&#13;
community health workers, such as midwives), who are less expensive.&#13;
13.4  In addition to employing cost.effective interventions, the project will significantly&#13;
reduce the current costs of deliveiing services by reducing the incidence of complications&#13;
of induced abortion. Fertility in Paraguay, at 4.7 births per woman, is the second highest&#13;
in South America. Judging by the levels of induced abortion, the most important cause of&#13;
maternal mortality, uLnwanted fertility is also high. Family planning services can&#13;
significantly reduce unwanted fertility and therefore induced abortion and its&#13;
complications. Family planning services, particularly when delivered through community-&#13;
based distribution (as in the case of this; project), are the most cost-effective means of&#13;
reducing maternal mortality, and improving maternal and child health. Using the average&#13;
costs of treatment of abortion-related complications derived from elsewhere in Latin&#13;
America (an average of $400 per abortion), this implies a cost to the health system of at&#13;
least US$480,000 dollars per year for the project areas alone24. Family planning services&#13;
can cost as little as US$20 per user per year.&#13;
13.5   The success of project interventions in meeting project objectives will be carefully&#13;
measured during the last year of the project. Given the poor quality of vital statistics and&#13;
service deliverv data, project impact will be measured by means of baseline and endline&#13;
surveys in project areas. The Centers for Disease Control conducted a large-scale national&#13;
maternal and child health household survey in January of 1996 which will be employed as&#13;
baseline information. The same questionnaire will be applied in project areas during the&#13;
final year of project implementation. Given the five-year interval, some mortality&#13;
indicators can be measured, namely, child, infant and perinatal mortality. Some morbidity&#13;
indicators are also available including prevalence of diarrhea, acute respiratory infection,&#13;
and reproductive morbidity. In additioni, indicators of coverage of professionally attended&#13;
delivery, prenatal care, tetanus toxoid imrnunization, family planning, child immunization,&#13;
are available as are service quality and utilization measures. The survey will also measure&#13;
population information regarding the benefits of these services and will identify the source&#13;
of that information.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
13.6   The Government of Paraguay invests relatively little in health. Including social&#13;
security health services, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) spent less than 2.5 percent&#13;
of GDP on health in 1994. What the Government does spend on health is also poorly&#13;
allocated. It is estimated that salaries absorb 80-85 percent of public health expenditures.&#13;
24 Health regions report between 20() and 2 50 treatments of complications of induced abortion per year,&#13;
yielding an average of 1200 to 1500 per year for the project areas. Underreporting of abortion and&#13;
its complications is common and thus one can assume the actual figures to be considerably higher.&#13;
The costs of US$400 for the treatment of complications of induced abortion were obtained from a&#13;
detailed study conducted in Nicaragua.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
This means that there are insufficient resources to cover maintenance of facilities and&#13;
equipment, to procure pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and to train staff.&#13;
13.7   The sustainability of project investments has been a concern from the inception of&#13;
the project. As a result, project design sought to optimize unit costs through: (a) an&#13;
expansion of maternal and child health care which relies on existing health personnel and&#13;
the incorporation of community midwives and health workers who deliver services&#13;
relatively cheaply compared to doctors, (b) using the results of a study of the network and&#13;
referral system for health facilities to guide the allocations for infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
in order to ensure that investments are channeled to the facilities most used by the&#13;
population; (c) rehabilitating existing infrastructure instead of investing in new&#13;
construction, and (d) increasing the durability of investments by assigning greater&#13;
emphasis to maintenance of infrastructure and equipment. Cost savings are expected&#13;
particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals through the use of international competitive&#13;
bidding as local prices exceed international prices by a wide margin.&#13;
13.8   The only salaries to be financed by the project are for a small number of staff to&#13;
assist in project management and infrastructure maintenance. Thus the incremental annual&#13;
recurrent expenditures required when the program is in full operation is likely to be small&#13;
($1.2 million) consisting mainly of consumables (drugs and supplies) and maintenance&#13;
costs for the anticipated higher quality and level of service delivery. Not only does this&#13;
represent less than one percent of the current budget of the MSPBS, but it should be&#13;
easily absorbable given the potential cost savings resulting from the project's efforts to&#13;
improve maintenance and to lower the cost of drugs. In addition, the Government would&#13;
gradually take over more responsibility for recurrent costs over the life of the project&#13;
given the decreasing rate of Bank financing.&#13;
D. RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
13.9   The main project risks are associated with: (a) the weak implementation capacity&#13;
of the Ministry at the central and regional level; (b) poor programming of counterpart and&#13;
project resources; and (c) administrative difficulties and legal barriers that could slow&#13;
project execution. The risks associated with implementation capacity are being minimized&#13;
by limiting the scope of activities and phasing their implementation, employing a detailed&#13;
Operational Manual specifying the implementation responsibilities, procedures and timing&#13;
to guide implementation, and providing technical assistance and training for MSPBS&#13;
central and regional staff Programming of project resources will be improved through the&#13;
development of clear guidelines and procedures regarding the timing and steps required to&#13;
ensure timely access to project and counterpart funds. These arrangements will be&#13;
reviewed with the Ministry of Finance, and will be included in the Operational Manual.&#13;
Administrative delays would be reduced by ensuring PCU staff have ample training on&#13;
Bank procedures. PCU staff have already attended procurement and disbursement&#13;
seminars, and have visited other Bank projects. Additional training will be made available&#13;
prior to project start-up. In addition, the Operational Manual details all steps to be taken&#13;
with regard to procurement, disbursement, and Bank reporting. Finally, an Administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
and Procurement Review to be held in the second year of the project will allow an early&#13;
analysis and solution to issues arising during implementation.&#13;

e) that the PCU and RCO' s will be staffed with high-caliber personnel satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank throughout the lifetime of the project (para. 9.6);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
f) that no changes in the Operational Manual would be made without prior Bank&#13;
consultation (para. 9.7);&#13;
g) that the MSPBS would furnish the Bank an Annual Report and Annual Implementation&#13;

h) The procurement of pharmaceuticals will be evaluated after 18 months. Should any&#13;
major problems be detected, available alternatives will be considered (para. 6.16);&#13;
i) that the training methodology to be employed to train auxiliary nurses and community&#13;
health workers will be akin to a competency-based methodology, employing a&#13;
participative format and with a practical rather than theoretical orientation (para 6.21);&#13;
and&#13;
j) that action plans for activities in the IEC subcomponent (para. 6.19), and training (para.&#13;
6.25) would be finalized before any other activities in the subcomponent can be&#13;
initiated.&#13;
14.3  As conditions of loan effectiveness the Government will have:&#13;

14.4  As a condition of disbursement of the rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
subcomponent for each health region, each health region will designate a maintenance&#13;
chief and present an MIP for the health region which identifies investments for the six years&#13;
of project implementation, estimates costs, and includes a detailed maintenance plan and a&#13;
human resource census (para 6.11).&#13;
B. RECOMMENDATION&#13;
14.5  Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a suitable basis for two Bank loans to the Republic of Paraguay for a total of&#13;
US$21.8 million equivalent. The first loan for a total of US$10.9 million would be a fixed-&#13;
rate US-Dollar-based Single Currency Loan repayable in 15 years. The second loan for a&#13;
total of US$10.9 million would be a Currency Pool Loan at the standard variable rate&#13;
repayable in 17 years.&#13;

DESCRIPTION OF PROTOCOLS&#13;
The following is a general description of project-related maternal and child services to be&#13;
delivered in project areas. A more detailed description is contained in the Operational Manual.&#13;
The content of each of the services described below will vary by the level of care in which it is&#13;
provided. Under normal conditions (i.e. when the option exists), an individual's first contact with&#13;
the health system will be at the primary level (health post). For preventive health services,&#13;
however, that initial contact may take place in the community. Staff at the primary level will&#13;
determine if referral to higher levels of care is necessary. The figure at the end of this annex&#13;
disaggregates services by type of care and level of care. It should be noted that although regional&#13;
hospital and health center services are included in the same box, some of the services they provide&#13;
differ in terms of the technology available. Regional hospitals are prepared to treat all obstetric&#13;
emergencies, whereas health centers are not.&#13;
Prenatal Care&#13;
Prenatal care in health facilities will include a physical examination to determine uterine&#13;
height, blood pressure, weight gain, the fetus' gestational age and heartbeat. In regional hospitals,&#13;
and health centers with laboratory facilities, the examination will also include blood and urine&#13;
laboratory work. Pregnant women will receive two tetanus toxoid immunizations during&#13;
pregnancy and a three-month supply of iron, micronutrient, and vitamin supplementation in each&#13;
visit. Tetanus toxoid immunization will be available at all health facilities provided they have&#13;
electricity. Pregnant women will receive two doses during gestation. Iodine supplements will be&#13;
provided through a separate program in the MSPBS once during pregnancy. Obstetric risk will&#13;
be evaluated at the health posts staffed with an auxiliary in obstetrics and health centers to identify&#13;
women who should be referred to higher levels of care for delivery. Health education on&#13;
reproductive risk factors, the benefits of breastfeeding, appropriate weaning practices, care during&#13;
pregnancy and infant care will be provided at all levels of care.&#13;
At the community level, CHWs will identify pregnant women in the community, and&#13;
provide them with health education either individually or in group talks, on the benefits of&#13;
breastfeeding, appropriate weaning practices, care during pregnancy and infant care. CHWs,&#13;
together with midwives, will organize community transportation to be used in the case of obstetric&#13;
emergencies in the community. Midwives will evaluate the obstetric risk of pregnant women&#13;
coming for prenatal care and refer high risk women to health centers. They will also refer&#13;
pregnant women to health facilities to receive tetanus toxoid immunization.&#13;
Delivery Care&#13;
Low risk deliveries will be performed at lower levels of care, reserving the space at&#13;
regional hospitals for high risk pregnancies. Only health posts with auxiliaries in obstetrics will&#13;
perform deliveries. Should a complication arise during delivery at a health center or post, the&#13;
patient will be transferred to a regional hospital through health service transportation when&#13;
available, or community-organized transportation. Only health posts staffed with an auxiliary&#13;
specialized in obstetrics will provide delivery care. The baby's weight, height and Apgar score&#13;
will be measured. Health education to be provided will include information on breastfeeding and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                  Annex 2&#13;
infant care. Midwives will perform deliveries in the community, as they always have, but with&#13;
further training and backup transportation in cases of emergency. They will also provide&#13;
information on breastfeeding and infant care. Midwives and health post staff will register infants&#13;
for growth monitoring. A pilot will be conducted to assess the feasibility and benefits of having&#13;
midwives perform deliveries in health posts which have no auxiliary specialized in obstetrics.&#13;
Postpartum Care&#13;
Postpartum care will include, at all levels of care, a pelvic exam, and health education&#13;
focusing on exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate weaning, infant care and family planning. CHWs&#13;
and midwives in the community will reinforce health education provided at health facilities.&#13;
Other Reproductive Health: Family Planning, Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases&#13;
(STDs) and Detection of Cervical Cancer&#13;
Family planning information and services will be available at all levels of care, and to&#13;
some extent in the community through midwives and CHWs. They will be instrumental in&#13;
identifying non-users who belong to high-risk groups, such as adolescents, and providing them&#13;
with information on reproductive health and, more specifically, on family planning. They will&#13;
provide barrier methods to current and new users and resupply oral contraceptives to current&#13;
users. A pilot will be conducted whereby midwives will be allowed to charge a nominal fee for&#13;
contraceptives and keep it as payment for their work. Hormonal methods to new users will be&#13;
prescribed at health facilities. Methods available at health posts include all non-clinical methods&#13;
(barrier methods, and hormonals (except implants)). They will make referrals to other levels of&#13;
care for other methods. Health centers will provide non-clinical methods and IUD insertion,&#13;
where staff are trained to do so, and will make referrals for other clinical methods. Regional&#13;
hospitals will provide surgical, clinical and non-clinical methods.&#13;
Community workers will also address some basic reproductive health issues in their&#13;
educational efforts including STDs and cervical cancer. All levels of the health care network will&#13;
provide STD screening. However, treatment will only be available at centers and regional&#13;
hospitals. STD screening will be performed during prenatal examinations or general&#13;
gynecological checkups. Health posts will employ simple, inexpensive diagnostic techniques (pH&#13;
dipsticks, and potassium hydroxide and normal saline). Health centers with laboratory facilities&#13;
and regional hospitals will provide more sophisticated screening procedures and will provide&#13;
treatment. Pap smears will also be available at health centers with laboratory facilities and&#13;
regional hospitals for women over 35 years of age. Positive test results will be followed up by&#13;
facility staff.&#13;
Child Health&#13;
Preventive child care services will be provided at health posts and in the community&#13;
through midwives and CHWs. They will be responsible for the identification of malnourished and&#13;
ill children in the community and make referrals to health facilities. In coordination with health&#13;
post and center staff, organize immunization campaigns. CHWs will provide health education for&#13;
mothers on oral rehydration therapy (ORT), child care, hygiene and nutrition. Growth monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                   Annex 2&#13;
for children under 3 years of age will be provided at health posts. Health education will be&#13;
provided at all levels. Child health services at health posts and centers include: immunization,&#13;
iodine supplementation, deworming, treatment of diarrheal disease, acute respiratory infections&#13;
(ARI), measles and malnutrition. The more severe cases of diarrhea, ARI, measles and&#13;
malnutrition will be treated in higher levels of care.&#13;

62                              Annex 3&#13;
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
The PCU will apply the following eligibility criteria to determine whether the&#13;
subproject can be considered for funding and included in the Master Investment Plan&#13;
and Implementation Plan.&#13;
Eligibility criteria are characteristics a subproject is required to meet in order to be&#13;
considered for possible funding. Failure to fulfill eligibility criteria will result in the&#13;
exclusion of the subproject.&#13;
General Eligibility criteria:&#13;
*     Amount:&#13;
Subproject costs should not exceed US$200,000.&#13;
Location:&#13;
Only subprojects in health establishments in the departments of Alto Paraguay, Alto&#13;
Parana, Amambay, Canindeyu, Concepcion and San Pedro will be eligible. Only&#13;
subprojects addressing maternal and child health services will be considered.&#13;
Application:&#13;
Only those interventions previously identified as priority investment in the&#13;
assessment of needed rehabilitation of the 5 regional hospitals and 2 health centers&#13;
will be considered. In the case of other health centers, needs identified in the health&#13;
network study apply (as reflected in the Master Investment Plan). Priority&#13;
assignment must have the no objection of the Regional Health Council.&#13;
Operation:&#13;
Certification by the Regional Director and the facility that the facility possesses the&#13;
needed human resources that it needs to operate according to the norms established&#13;
in the Operational Manual. Define a critical mass, and that the subproject contains a&#13;
maintenance plan.&#13;
Implementation:&#13;
The estimated duration of implementation should not exceed 12 months from the&#13;
initiation of bidding process to its completion.&#13;
*     Coherence:&#13;
The subproject should be coherent with the strategy of the sector's development and there&#13;
should not exist overlapping of financing sources in the same subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                               Annex 3&#13;
Type:&#13;
Subprojects should belong to one of the following categories:&#13;
Elegibility Criteria specific to Infrastructure Subprojects:&#13;
Infrastructure subprojects should be justified in the context of a global and individual&#13;
analysis of the establishment and its rehabilitation.&#13;
Repair: Repair subprojects would be eligible when they are located in viable&#13;
facilities, and when the repair cost would not exceed 35 percent of the replacement&#13;
value.&#13;
Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation subprojects would be eligible whether or not the&#13;
rehabilitation implies a change in the facility functionality, when:&#13;
a)    The cost of civil works does not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value.&#13;
b)    They are performed in facilities which are considered viable and the total&#13;
value of civil works does not exceed 50 percent of its replacement value.&#13;
Replacement: These subprojects will be eligible for funding in the following cases:&#13;
a)    When patient and personnel safety may be clearly at stake.&#13;
b)    When the repair is not structurally viable.&#13;
c)    When the repair cost would exceed 35 percent of the replacement value.&#13;
Construction: This type of investment will be considered only in exceptional cases.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria specific to Medical Equipment Subprojects:&#13;
Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to either replace the equipment, or&#13;
increase the supply and the quality of services.&#13;
a)    Replacement: Equipment replacement subprojects will be eligible when&#13;
the equipment is no longer functional.&#13;
b)    New: When the incorporation of additional equipment is technically justified.&#13;
Repair: These subprojects will be accepted when:&#13;
a)    The repair cost does not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value and&#13;
results an increase of the useful life of the equipment in of least 50 percent&#13;
according to the manufacturer's technical specifications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                               Annex 3&#13;
b)    When the repair cost would exceeds 35 percent of the value, the equipment&#13;
would be replaced.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria specific to Industrial Equipment Subprojects:&#13;
*     Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to replace the equipment, or increase&#13;
the supply and the quality of services.&#13;
Replacement subprojects will be eligible for funding when:&#13;
a)    Replacement: the equipment is out of order or when its operation causes&#13;
inefficiencies in the establishment's normal operation, and when the&#13;
economic evaluation of the possible alternatives recommends such&#13;
replacement.&#13;
b)    New: when the incorporation of additional equipment is technically justified.&#13;
*     Repair: These subprojects will be eligible for funding in the following cases:&#13;
a)    When the repair cost would not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value&#13;
and when such repair would increase the useful life of the equipment by at&#13;
least 50 percent according to the manufacturer's technical specifications.&#13;
b)    When the repair cost exceeds 35 percent of the value, the equipment&#13;
replacement would be advised.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria Specific to Vehicles Subprojects:&#13;
Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to either replace or add additional&#13;
means of transportation (i.e. vehicles, motorcycles, bycicles). These may be&#13;
reassigned from other areas.&#13;
a)    Replacement: Subprojects will be given priority when vehicles are in need&#13;
of repair or when their operating conditions might cause inefficiencies in the&#13;

(a) foreign bidders may be required as a prerequisite for bidding, to be registered with&#13;

Borrower to such bidders is of such nature that it will not discourage their&#13;
participation;&#13;
(b) foreign bidders shall not be required to notarize their bidding documents with&#13;
Paraguayan authorities as a prerequisite of bidding. However, such foreign bidders&#13;
shall be required to notarize their bid documentation by the corresponding authority&#13;

(e) foreign bidders shall be allowed to participate in national competitive bidding;&#13;
(f) the price of contracts for works or goods which duration is for more than eighteen&#13;

price;&#13;
(g) foreign consultants will be selected from those included on a short list on the basis of&#13;
evaluation criteria and terms of reference, both satisfactory to the Bank;&#13;
(h) in case of international competitive bidding or limited international bidding, Bank's&#13;
standard documents will be used; and&#13;
(i) in case of national competitive bidding documents acceptable to the Bank will be&#13;
used. Those "acceptable" documents should be prepared on the basis of the Bank's&#13;
standard, and may include provisions to accommodate local procurement practices to&#13;
the extent that such practices are consistent with the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
This annex provides a detailed justification for the project. It consolidates material&#13;
discussed in various sections of this report in order to address, step by step, the relevant&#13;
issues and considerations that led to the present project design. The analysis considers: (a)&#13;
linkages to economic and sector work; (b) analysis of alternatives; and (c) impact and&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
The primary objective of the proposed project is to improve maternal and child&#13;
health in six predominantly rural departments in northeastern Paraguay. This region of the&#13;
country contains most of the recent migrant settlements and a majority of indigenous&#13;
population. The six departments have limited access to running water, sewage disposal&#13;
and electricity. With the exception of four departments in the Chaco, which together&#13;
contain less than two percent of the population, five of the departments included in the&#13;
project have the highest poverty levels in Paraguay. The total poor population to be&#13;
covered by the health component is approximately 500,000, out of which 210,000 are&#13;
children under five years of age and women of childbearing age. Maternal and child&#13;
mortality and morbidity in these departments are among the highest in the nation.&#13;
B. Linkages to Economic and Sector Work&#13;
Resuming operations in 1990, after a long hiatus, the Bank conducted a number of&#13;
studies to update its knowledge-base of the Paraguayan economy and current economic&#13;
and social conditions. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was developed on the basis&#13;
of the results of the initial economic and sector studies'. The CAS was discussed and&#13;
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on December 21, 1993 with the Eighth&#13;
Highways Project (Report P-5916-PA).&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy. The objectives of the Bank's assistance strategy in&#13;
Paraguay are to support: (a) private sector development; (b) agricultural development and&#13;
natural resource management; and (c) poverty alleviation through human resource&#13;
development. The CAS specifically identifies the improvement of social service delivery&#13;
as a priority to alleviate poverty and strengthen human resources. It notes the importance&#13;
of improving the targeting of health services, service quality, and resource allocation&#13;
within the sector. Maternal and child morbi-mortality were identified as unnecessarily high&#13;
given that they can be easily prevented. The need to strengthen institutional capacity,&#13;
particularly in the areas of investment and budget planning, management, accounting and&#13;
'Country Economic Memorandum - CEM (Report No. 9147-PA dated October 15, 1991), Public&#13;
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA dated June 16, 1992),and a study of&#13;
the implications of Paraguay's joining the MERCOSUR trade area (Report No. 10902-PA dated&#13;
January 28, 1993).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                             Annex 10&#13;
control, and other measures to increase administrative efficiency was stressed. The&#13;
strengthening of management capability at all levels was highlighted, in light of the&#13;
decentralization and deconcentration of social services that is beginning to take place.&#13;
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). Early sector work shaped the content of&#13;
the CAS. The analysis noted that public health resources are poorly allocated, with most&#13;
health expenditures being absorbed by salaries (up to 80 percent). It also noted that public&#13;
resources are concentrated on curative rather than preventive care, and on tertiary care&#13;
over the lower levels of care. A report completed after the CAS was drafted, focused&#13;
specifically on the poverty and the social sectors (Poverty and the Social Sectors in&#13;
Paraguay, Report No. 12293-PA, dated June 29, 1994). This report showed the poor to&#13;
be located principally in the periphery of Asunci6n, the northern departments and part of&#13;
the East. It found that the poor are more likely to have limited schooling and poor health,&#13;
and that they are more likely to be indigenous and migrants. In its examination of the&#13;
relationship between health and poverty, the report indicated that health resources are&#13;
unevenly distributed, resulting in an overconcentration of resources in Asunci6n and other&#13;
large urban areas at the expense of poorer regions. This maldistribution has resulted in&#13;
significantly higher rates of maternal and child morbidity and mortality in these&#13;
departments. Sector work also noted the important role that community participation has&#13;
had in social development projects and recommends its incorporation into projects.&#13;
The Project. The proposed project fully supports the country assistance strategy&#13;
and findings of the ESW. The main objective of the project is to improve maternal and&#13;
child health in project areas through direct interventions designed to: (a) improve&#13;
available infrastructure and equipment; (b) improve competence of MSPBS paramedical&#13;
staff through a modified and enhanced training methodology; (c) increase general&#13;
awareness and information regarding health promotion and good health behavior among&#13;
the population; (d) increase the emphasis on preventive health in MSPBS services; (e)&#13;
facilitate access to less expensive pharmaceuticals; (f) improve regional management and&#13;
implementation capability; (g) increase access of early stimulation programs for poor&#13;
urban children; (h) increase child care options for low-income mothers, and (i) strengthen&#13;
collaboration with the community and NGOs to improve service delivery.&#13;
The project also seeks to enhance early child development through a small pilot&#13;
designed to establish integrated child development centers. The project's integrated child&#13;
development activities would also improve working opportunities for women. The health&#13;
component would target six of the poorest departments in Paraguay. The child&#13;
development component would target the urban fringes of Asunci6n, another area of high&#13;
incidence of poverty identified by the poverty report.&#13;
C. Analysis of Alternatives&#13;
Why a Health Care Intervention? Several avenues are available to improve the&#13;
health of the population. Health can be enhanced through improvements in educational&#13;
attainment, socio-economic development, individual life-styles and the environment as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80                              Annex 10&#13;
much as it can be by the health care system itself The greater the importance of&#13;
communicable diseases in the overall burden of disease, the greater the potential impact of&#13;
health care improvements. The more chronic and degenerative disease in a population, i.e.&#13;
the older the population, the greater the role of economic development, education, life-&#13;
styles and the environment in improving health. In Paraguay, communicable diseases are&#13;
important contributors to the burden of disease. Thus, direct interventions in how services&#13;
are delivered will have an important effect on health status. Also, the Bank is already&#13;
financing a secondary education project, a rural water supply project, and, in Asunci6n, a&#13;
sewerage project.&#13;
Why Maternal and Child Health? Paraguay's cause of death structure&#13;
characterizes it as being in a mid-epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious&#13;
diseases and chronic/degenerative diseases being among the top five killers. Infectious&#13;
diseases, including upper respiratory tract infections and diarrheal disease are included&#13;
among the main causes of death of the population as a whole, along with cardiovascular&#13;
disease, neoplasms and accidents. Death from perinatal causes (birth lesions, infections&#13;
and neonatal tetanus) is also significant. And, maternal mortality is the highest in the&#13;
region. Infectious diseases, perinatal and maternal death are all characteristic of contexts&#13;
with high fertility (young population) and poor health delivery capability. And, are all&#13;
amenable to effective, low cost interventions with short-term effects. Cardiovascular&#13;
disease and neoplasms are more typical of a low fertility (older) population, and accidents&#13;
are more common in more urbanized settings. Reducing mortality from these causes is&#13;
considerably more expensive, and prevention is very long-term. Investing in maternal and&#13;
child health will have longer term effects as children have a whole life ahead of them&#13;
(cardiovascular disease and neoplasms affect older generations), and shorter-term results,&#13;
and tackling them will be considerably less costly.&#13;
It may be argued that in order for the MSPBS to make sustainable changes in the&#13;
quality and coverage of health services, projects would need to address the manner in&#13;
which health care is financed, how resources are allocated within the sector, and how&#13;
allocated resources are used. It would require a careful analysis of how the system&#13;
functions and of the feasible alternatives to guide change. ESW has not focused on the&#13;
health sector and thus little is known regarding health financing, sector efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness, and equity. Little is known of the extent of private sector delivery and&#13;
finance, and how it is regulated. There is no information on the quality of private services,&#13;
nor of the coverage of private health insurance. What is known is that not enough&#13;
resources are spent on health, and that 80 percent are absorbed by salaries, leaving&#13;
managers little room to "allocate" resources. Moreover, given the Government's intention&#13;
to decentralize the health sector, the current paradigm could change significantly. A&#13;
project designed to introduce some structural changes would require a detailed analysis of&#13;
the sector and a clear view as to which way the decentralization is headed.&#13;
The proposed project seeks to reduce the ill-effects of the maldistribution of&#13;
resources on the poor, and will, to the extent possible, correct some of the allocation&#13;
problems. By investing in secondary level facilities it reduces the tertiary care bias, and by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81                              Annex 10&#13;
investing in preventive care it reduces the curative care bias. Moreover, the project will&#13;
finance activities to improve the management of health services at the regional and central&#13;
levels to ensure more effective decision-making at least regarding project inputs.&#13;
The project's objectives, to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality, are&#13;
in line with the Bank's assistance strategy for Paraguay and the GOP's health priorities.&#13;
In response to the poor state of maternal and perinatal health, the Government drafted a&#13;
National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality in 1994, to be&#13;
implemented in conjunction with other public and private providers with both local and&#13;
external funding.&#13;
Why this Project Design? The main causes of maternal death in Paraguay are&#13;
abortion, toxemia, hemorrhage, and sepsis. The high maternal mortality and morbidity&#13;
rates are a direct result of a lack of appropriate prenatal care, unsafe delivery care, and&#13;
absence of family planning services. In project, areas one-half of all birth are delivered by&#13;
midwives, many of which work in unsanitary settings and are improperly trained. Poorly&#13;
performed births account for an important share of infant deaths as birth lesions are by far&#13;
the main cause of death of children under one year of age. Inadequate access to modern2&#13;
contraceptive services and information accounts for the high proportion of women bearing&#13;
children in situations that are more likely to result in pregnancy and birth complications&#13;
(i.e. bearing children when they are too young, too old, of high parity or within short birth&#13;
intervals) and a high level of unwanted fertility (as evidenced by the high number of&#13;
induced abortions). One third of women giving birth in Paraguay can be classified as&#13;
being of high reproductive risk. Besides reducing the mother's risk of infection and other&#13;
complications, safe delivery will reduce the incidence of birth lesions, sepsis and asphyxia&#13;
in newborns. Family planning has beneficial effects both for the mother and for the&#13;
survival of her child as well. Family planning reduces maternal mortality by reducing the&#13;
risk of induced abortion, and by reducing exposure to childbirth complications. Family&#13;
planning also helps women lengthen the interval between births allowing them to recover&#13;
fully between births, and in this way increasing the chances of survival of their newborn.&#13;
The health service delivery interventions to be provided in project areas will be&#13;
complemented by an information, education and communications program aimed at&#13;
generating health promotion behavior at the household level. The information/education&#13;
will be provided massively through a radio campaign and individually in health facilities&#13;
and the community. Inducing behavior change leading to improved health practices will&#13;
facilitate and enhance the effects of service delivery system interventions. The effects of&#13;
health education are more difficult to measure but it has been widely demonstrated that&#13;
health education leads to a more effective utilization of health care and to lower levels of&#13;
morbidity of easily preventable causes. The cost per "illness" averted varies by type of&#13;
morbidity.&#13;
2 Modern contraception includes any of the following methods: hormonal methods (orals, injections, or&#13;
implants), intra-uterine devices, male and female sterilization, and barrier methods (condoms, foams,&#13;
diaphragms, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                             Annex 10&#13;
Improved prenatal care, safe delivery and family planning are the three main&#13;
interventions designed to reduce maternal morbi-mortality in the project. All three have&#13;
been shown to be highly cost-effective in other countries, particularly when combined with&#13;
health education, as is the case in the proposed project. According to the findings of the&#13;
1993 World Development Report, Investing in Health, the annual cost per participant of&#13;
prenatal and delivery care in low-income countries would be US$90. The annual cost per&#13;
user of family planning services is US$12. The total cost per participant of prenatal,&#13;
delivery and family planning services would come to US$102 in low-income countries.&#13;
The main causes of infant deaths, i.e., birth lesions, tetanus and infections of the&#13;
newborn, can all be easily prevented with adequate prenatal and delivery care. These&#13;
causes account for one-third of all infant deaths. Other important causes of death among&#13;
children under 5 years of age are acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea&#13;
(accounting for one-quarter of all deaths), both preventable with adequate treatment,&#13;
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water&#13;
and health education. Thus, improved prenatal and delivery care and access to family&#13;
planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality and morbidity significantly.&#13;
Complementing these services with treatment of common infectious diseases children are&#13;
vulnerable to and health education would address most of the health problems of these&#13;
target groups. Among children under 5 years of age, one quarter of all deaths are due to&#13;
acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea, both preventable with adequate treatment,&#13;
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water&#13;
and health education. These interventions are also very cost-effective. Treatment of&#13;
common childhood illnesses comes to US$9 per participant, and treatment of minor&#13;
trauma for all ages up to US$6 per participant according to the 1993 World Development&#13;
Report.&#13;
The 1993 World Development Report estimates the annual cost per participant to&#13;
receive a package of services equivalent to what will be delivered under the project at&#13;
US$117 per user. The per capita annual cost of providing this package of services&#13;
(including health education, which was not costed per participant) comes to US$12. The&#13;
estimated per capita cost of providing these services within the Project will come to&#13;
US$8.70, well below the estimated average. Costs are low given the reliance on health&#13;
care personnel other than doctors (nurses and community health workers, such as&#13;
midwives), who are less expensive.&#13;
In addition to employing cost-effective interventions, the project will significantly&#13;
reduce the current costs of delivering services by reducing the incidence of complications&#13;
of induced abortion. Fertility in Paraguay, at 4.7 births per woman, is the second highest&#13;
in South America. Judging by the levels of induced abortion, the most important cause of&#13;
maternal mortality, unwanted fertility is also high. Family planning services can&#13;
significantly reduce unwanted fertility and therefore induced abortion and its&#13;
complications. Family planning services, particularly when delivered through community-&#13;
based distribution (as in the case of this project), are the most cost-effective means of&#13;
reducing maternal mortality, and improving maternal and child health. Using the average&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83                                Annex 10&#13;
costs of treatment of abortion-related complications derived from elsewhere in Latin&#13;
America (an average of $400 per abortion), this implies a cost to the health system of at&#13;
least $600,000 dollars a year for the project areas alone3. Family planning services can&#13;
cost as little as US$20 per user per year.&#13;
The success of project interventions in meeting project objectives will be carefully&#13;
measured during the last year of the project. Given the poor quality of vital statistics and&#13;
service delivery data, project impact will be measured by means of baseline and endline&#13;
surveys in project areas. The Centers for Disease Control conducted a large-scale national&#13;
maternal and child health household survey in January of 1996 which will be employed as&#13;
baseline information. The same questionnaire will be applied in project areas during the&#13;
final year of project implementation. Given the five-year interval, some mortality&#13;
indicators can be measured, namely, child, infant and perinatal mortality. Some morbidity&#13;
indicators are also available including prevalence of diarrhea, acute respiratory infection,&#13;
and reproductive morbidity. In addition, indicators of coverage of professionally attended&#13;
delivery, prenatal care, tetanus toxoid immunization, family planning, child immunization,&#13;
are available as are service quality and utilization measures. The survey will also measure&#13;
population information regarding the benefits of these services and will identify the source&#13;
of that information.&#13;
D. Financial and Fiscal Impact&#13;
The Government of Paraguay invests relatively little in health. Including social&#13;
security health services, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) spent less than 2.5 percent&#13;
of GDP on health in 1994. What the Government does spend on health is also poorly&#13;
allocated. It is estimated that salaries absorb 80-85 percent of public health expenditures.&#13;
This means that there are insufficient resources to cover maintenance of facilities and&#13;
equipment, to procure pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and to train staff&#13;
The sus.ainability of project investments has been a concern from the inception of&#13;
the project. As a result, project design sought to optimize unit costs through: (a) an&#13;
expansion of maternal and child health care which relies on existing health personnel and&#13;
the incorporation of community midwives and health workers who deliver services&#13;
relatively cheaply compared to doctors; (b) using the results of a study of the network and&#13;
referral system for health facilities to guide the allocations for infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
in order to ensure that investments are channeled to the facilities most used by the&#13;
population; (c) rehabilitating existing infrastructure instead of investing in new&#13;
construction; and (d) increasing the durability of investments by assigning greater&#13;
emphasis to maintenance of infrastructure and equipment. Cost savings are expected,&#13;
3 Health regions report between 200 and 250 treatments of complications of induced abortion per year,&#13;
yielding an average of 1200 to 1500 per year for the project areas. Underreporting of abortion and&#13;
its complications is common and thus one can assume the actual figures to be considerably higher.&#13;
The costs of US$400 for the treatment of complications of induced abortion were obtained from a&#13;
detailed study conducted in Nicaragua.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84                              Annex 10&#13;
particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals through the use of international competitive&#13;
bidding as local prices exceed international prices by a wide margin.&#13;
The only salaries to be financed by the project are for a small number of staff to&#13;
assist in project management and infrastructure maintenance. Thus the incremental annual&#13;
recurrent expenditures required when the program is in full operation is likely to be small&#13;
($1.2 million) consisting mainly of consumables (drugs and supplies) and maintenance&#13;
costs for the anticipated higher quality and level of service delivery. Not only does this&#13;
represent less than 1 percent of the current budget of the MSPBS, but it should be easily&#13;
absorbable given the potential cost savings resulting from the project's efforts to improve&#13;
maintenance and to lower the cost of drugs. In addition, the Government would gradually&#13;
take over more responsibility for recurrent costs over the life of the project given the&#13;
decreasing rate of Bank financing.&#13;
E. Risk Analysis&#13;
The main project risks are associated with: (a) the weak implementation capacity&#13;
of the Ministry at the central and regional level; (b) poor programming of counterpart and&#13;
project resources; and (c) administrative difficulties and legal barriers that could slow&#13;
project execution. The risks associated with implementation capacity are being minimized&#13;
by limiting the scope of activities and phasing their implementation, employing a detailed&#13;
Operational Manual specifying the implementation responsibilities, procedures and timing&#13;
to guide implementation, and providing technical assistance and training for MSPBS&#13;
central and regional staff. Programming of project resources will be improved through the&#13;
development of clear guidelines and procedures regarding the timing and steps required to&#13;
ensure timely access to project and counterpart funds. These arrangements will be&#13;
reviewed with the Ministry of Finance, and will be included in the Operational Manual.&#13;
Administrative delays would be reduced by ensuring PCU staff have ample training on&#13;
Bank procedures. PCU staff have already attended procurement and disbursement&#13;
seminars, and have visited other Bank projects. Additional training will be made available&#13;
prior to project start-up. In addition, the Operational Manual details all steps to be taken&#13;
with regard to procurement, disbursement, and Bank reporting. Finally, an Administrative&#13;
and Procurement Review to be held in the second year of the project will allow an early&#13;
analysis and solution to issues arising during implementation.&#13;

            Paraguay - Maternal Health and Child
            Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Maternal
            Health and Child Development Project is to improve the
            health status of the underserved Paraguayan population,
            particularly women and children. To achieve this objective,
            the project will: 1) increase the coverage, quality and
            efficiency of basic maternal and child health services in
            six underserved departments in Northeastern Paraguay; 2)
            increase the population's knowledge about adequate
            health practices; 3) pilot-test a strategy to enhance early
            child development in Asuncion; and 4) strengthen management
            capability in support of an eventual decentralization of a
            public health services in project areas. It is expected that
            the project will: (a) increase the coverage and quality of
            institutional deliveries; (b) improve the safety of home
            deliveries; (c) improve the detection, transport and
            treatment of obstetric complications; (d) improve access to
            reproductive health services and information; (e) improve
            immunization coverage; (f) reduce the incidence of acute
            respiratory infections and diarrheal disease; (g) improve
            children's schooling readiness; and (h) increase
            community involvement in both health and child development
            activities. The components of the project are as follows: 1)
            maternal and child health care, including: (i)
            rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure and
            equipment; (ii) pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; (iii)
            information, education and communication; and (iv) training;
            2) early child development pilot; and 3) strengthening
            management for the decentralization of health services in
            project areas.
