            experience with output-based contracts
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Argentine government is using
            output-based contracts with the private sector for
            rehabilitation and maintenance of its nonconcessioned road
            network. The multiyear lump sum contracts, funded by the
            government, specify required road service outputs and use
            incentive-based payment schedules to ensure the quality of
            the work. After three years of operation the 60 contracts
            (averaging US$10 million) in the first phase are working
            well. By 2002 around 75 percent of Argentina's
            nonconcessional roads should be operating under output-based contracts.
