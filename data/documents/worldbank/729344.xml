Extending Telecommunications beyond&#13;
the Market&#13;
Toward universal service in competitive environments&#13;
Bjofirn Welleniius    Competitive markets go a long way toward making telecommunications services available&#13;
throughout the population. But governments often seek to extend access to services beyond what&#13;
the private sector will provide on its own. Cost-effective measures to achieve widespread access&#13;
focus on removing obstacles that prevent the market from working well, letting users decide what&#13;
they need and can afford, and using market mechanisms to allocate responsibility for extending&#13;
service beyond the market and to quantify and allocate any necessary funding. As they adopt such&#13;
measures, governments must make some decisions: Which services to extend? To what population&#13;
groups? At what cost? Who should provide the additional service? Who should pay? The answers&#13;
vary widely among countries and over time. This Note outlines options and best practices,&#13;
emphasizing those relevant to emerging economies.&#13;

            Extending telecommunications beyond the
            market : toward universal service in competitive environments
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Competitive markets go a long way toward
            making telecommunications services available throughout the
            population. But governments often seek to extend access to
            services beyond what the private sector will provide on its
            own. To widen access, governments must remove obstacles that
            prevent the market from working well, and must let users
            decide what they need and can afford. Market mechanisms must
            be allowed to determine who will extend service beyond the
            market, how much will be invested, and where. As governments
            adopt such measures, they must make some critical decisions:
            Which services to extend? To what population groups? At what
            cost? Who should provide the additional service? Who should
            pay? The answers vary widely among countries and over time.
            This Note outlines options and best practices, emphasizing
            those relevant to emerging economies.
