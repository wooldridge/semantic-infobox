1. BASIC EDUCATION IN CHINA&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS&#13;
Sector Reform Agenda&#13;
1.1   Educational development is a major instrument in China's drive for&#13;
modernization to the end of this century and the early stage of the 21st century.&#13;
Educational reforms and development, responsive to the changing human capital&#13;
demands of the growing economy, were encapsulated in a series of policy and legal&#13;
documents, such as "Decision to Reform the Educational Structure" (1985), "Compulsory&#13;
Education Law" (1986), "Outline for Reform and Development of Education" (1993),&#13;
and "Education Law" (1995). The current reforms relevant to basic education focus on&#13;
the following areas: (a) the provision of nine years' basic education for all school-age&#13;
children; (b) the development of vocational and technical education at the secondary and&#13;
postsecondary levels; (c) the strengthening of education management at all levels by&#13;
strengthening the role of principals and local authorities in the design of the reforms, and&#13;
transferring the responsibility for providing basic education to local governments under&#13;
the central government's policy guidance and financial support; (d) the great increase of&#13;
investment in basic education by the governments at all levels; (e) the continuous&#13;
improvement and gradual standardization of school operational conditions; (f) the&#13;
enhancement of teachers quality by further strengthening of teachers' education and&#13;
training. The State Education Commission (SEdC), created in June 1986 as the successor&#13;
to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and responsible nationally for policy, budgeting and&#13;
coordination of this sector, therefore has the mission of overseeing the above reforms at&#13;
the national level.&#13;
Basic Education: Targets and Current Situation&#13;
1.2   China's achievements in the provision of comprehensive schooling have been&#13;
spearheaded by pursuing the national target of achieving universal basic education (UBE)&#13;
with differential timescales throughout the country. In 1986, the Government passed a&#13;
"Compulsory Education Law" that instituted a nine-year basic education system, divided&#13;
into two stages: primary education (with 5 or 6 grades) and lower secondary (with 3 or 4&#13;
grades, depending on provincial plans). According to specific implementation plans,&#13;
"compulsory" education should be achieved gradually in different regions, with urban&#13;
and more developed areas in the interior achieving universal education first, and less&#13;
developed areas more gradually. Universalization of the nine-year program throughout&#13;
China is expected to be achieved by 2000.&#13;
1.3   National criteria for successful achievement of nine-year compulsory education&#13;
are highly specific and include the following: net enrollment rates for primary education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
of over 98 percent and the transition rate into lower secondary of approximately&#13;
95 percent; retention rates of over 97 percent within each year at the primary level;&#13;
promotion of more than 95 percent of primary completers to lower secondary; and a&#13;
national completion rate of 98 percent for primary education in urban and developed&#13;
areas, with individual provinces determining completion rates for lower secondary.&#13;
Dropout rates at primary level are to be held at under 1 percent and under 2 percent at&#13;
lower secondary level. The ratio of qualified teachers at primary level will be more than&#13;
90 percent and at lower secondary more than 80 percent. The illiteracy rate among the&#13;
population aged 15 is not to exceed 1 percent. Floor space norms for primary schools are&#13;
3 to 5 square meters per pupil and 4 to 6 meters for lower secondary. Refinements of&#13;
these norms change according to number of classes in the school, with the unit generally&#13;
decreasing as the number of classes increases.&#13;
1.4   Criteria for poor rural areas are different. The net enrollment target rate for&#13;
primary schooling is 95 percent; for lower secondary is 85 percent; and dropout rates for&#13;
primary and lower secondary are 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively. The percentage of&#13;
primary graduates among the 15-year-old population is determined by the provinces. The&#13;
illiteracy rate among the 15-year-old population is not to exceed 5 percent.  The&#13;
enrollment and dropout rates for girls, and illiteracy rate among girls aged 15 will follow&#13;
provincial criteria. More than 90 percent of rural primary teachers (the same as the&#13;
national criterion) and not less that 70 percent of lower secondary teachers will be&#13;
qualified.&#13;
1.5    Despite the challenges posed by an 80 percent rural population, and immense&#13;
variations in agricultural and economic conditions, China has already gone far in meeting&#13;
these targets. In 1994, enrollment rates for the first nine years of schooling were&#13;
reportedly 98.4 percent of the 6-11 age cohort enrolled in primary education, and more&#13;
than 60 percent of the 12-15 age cohort in lower secondary schools. Of primary&#13;
graduates, 81.8 percent went on to secondary schools (regular or vocational). Almost 98&#13;
percent of all school-age girls were enrolled in primary education. A significant&#13;
consequence of these high enrollment figures is the high literacy rates: 80 percent for&#13;
those above 15 years of age and about 93 percent among those between 15 and 25 years&#13;
of age. The projected figures for 2000 are 134 million pupils at primary level, compared&#13;
to 124 million in 1994, and 70 million at lower secondary level, an appreciable increase&#13;
over the 41 million students in 1994. Currently, China runs the largest primary school&#13;
system in the world, with 5.6 million teachers and about 697,000 schools. At the lower&#13;
secondary level (typically grade 7-9), there are 2.6 million teachers and 68,500 schools.&#13;
Regular senior secondary schools number 14,000, with 560,000 teachers.&#13;
1.6   China's record of progress may be attributed to five factors:  a strong and&#13;
sustained political commitment to the development of basic education as evidenced by&#13;
the growth in public expenditures on education from Y 9.9 billion in 1983 to Y 41.4&#13;
billion in 1993 (constant 1987 Renminbi) (see Annex 1, Table 1.3); effective organization&#13;
at all levels from the national to the local; the overall national policy of decentralization&#13;
to local authority and responsibility; strong community support to and participation in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
basic education development; and a pragmatic approach to resolving problems and&#13;
constraints.&#13;
B. THE BASIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM: DISPARITIES AND ISSUES&#13;
1.7   Global figures, though indicative of substantial progress, tend to mask disparities&#13;
in basic education development. Because the bulk of funding for primary and lower&#13;
secondary schooling falls on the shoulders of local governments at the village, township&#13;
and county levels, there are noticeable imbalances in the availability of educational&#13;
services between the economically advanced regions that can amply supplement national&#13;
funds, and the underdeveloped areas with very limited resources. For example, the&#13;
average rural income in poor counties is Y 400 compared with the national rural average&#13;
of Y 921.6.' Generally, urban and coastal areas have achieved the goal of nine-year basic&#13;
education but many poor, sparsely-populated and remote areas have not reached primary&#13;
education targets. The State Council in its recent "National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan&#13;
(1994-2000)" designated 592 counties to be national poverty counties which, as a&#13;
consequence, will be the focus of special poverty-targeted programs, financing and other&#13;
interventions. These counties are variously called "national poverty counties" or "8/7&#13;
counties." Schooling in these national poverty counties is marked by poor attendance and&#13;
high repetition and dropout rates.&#13;
1.8   The net enrollment ratio (NER) for primary school-age children now lags the&#13;
national average of 97.7 percent by a significant margin in five provinces-Sichuan,&#13;
Guizhou, Gansu, Yunnan and Qinghai-and in three autonomous regions-Tibet,&#13;
Ningxia and Xinjiang. The proposed project covers counties in Qinghai while the other&#13;
four provinces plus Xinjiang and Ningxia have been covered by earlier basic education&#13;
projects. Regional disparities are also indicated by completion rates (proportion of&#13;
children entering first grade who eventually complete grade 5). While the national&#13;
average in 1991-92 was estimated at 91 percent, it ranged between 99.7 percent in Beijing&#13;
and 78.6 percent in Jiangxi Province.&#13;
1.9   Two groups in the poor areas tend to be particularly disadvantaged-minority&#13;
nationalities and girls.  This reflects both cultural factors and the poverty of the&#13;
inhabitants, who need children to help the family subsist. In areas populated by minority&#13;
nationalities, economic and education levels are lower than the national average. China&#13;
has 55 minority nationalities totaling 91.2 million people and constituting 8 percent of the&#13;
population. Areas inhabited by these minorities cover 64 percent of the entire country.&#13;
There are 80 spoken languages and over 30 writing systems used by the minority&#13;
nationalities. In a study of school age children in 25 minority counties conducted by the&#13;
State Education Commission, the gross enrollment rate was 20 percentage points lower&#13;
than the national mean, with female enrollment being particularly low. This occurs&#13;
despite findings of a household survey done in four poor counties in two provinces,&#13;
l Both are State Statistical Bureau (SSB) figures for 1993 expressed in 1993 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
which shows a high demand for and willingness to pay for basic education that seems to&#13;
be uniform for minority and nonninority populations in poverty areas. (See para. 5.7 for&#13;
more details.)&#13;
1.10 Among the deprived sections of the population, girls and women continue to be&#13;
more disadvantaged. Facilities for basic education are equally available for boys and&#13;
girls, yet there is a significantly lower level of utilization of facilities by girls. Almost&#13;
half the rural population is illiterate or semiliterate, and women make up 70 percent of&#13;
this number. While almost 98 percent of all school-aged girls nationwide were reportedly&#13;
enrolled in primary education in 1994, an increase of nearly 80 percent over that of China&#13;
in 1949, about two thirds of 2.6 million school-age children not in school in 1994 were&#13;
girls. China's western regions and remote, rural areas show even worse enrollment&#13;
levels.  Government studies have identified economic, sociocultural, and religious&#13;
hindrances, and lack of information regarding the potential benefits of education as the&#13;
major factors constraining girls' education.&#13;
1.11  The disparity in basic education coverage between coastal/urban areas and poor,&#13;
rural areas is manifested in a range of specific problems, the most notable being:&#13;
(a)   Rural primary and lower secondary schools are more inefficient than&#13;
their urban counterparts. This is evidenced by low student-teacher&#13;
ratios, incomplete schools, low completion rates, and low girls'&#13;
enrollments, particularly in minority schools. A survey of 328 counties in&#13;
1992 found an inverse correlation between net income per capita and&#13;
dropout and repetition rates; the lower the net income, the higher the&#13;
dropout and repetition rates. Some estimates show that nearly one third of&#13;
the children who enter grade I in poor areas drop out before completing&#13;
grade 5. Generally, there are no mechanisms to identify efficiency-related&#13;
issues and to provide and monitor corrective measures.&#13;
(b)   Seriously underfinanced rural schools in poor counties provide highly&#13;
inadequate schooling facilities. Buildings are in such poor physical&#13;
condition that they are officially classified as "dangerous." In counties in&#13;
the proposed project area, 6 percent of primary schools and 5 percent of&#13;
lower secondary schools have dangerous buildings.   The school&#13;
environment is not conducive to learning: bilingual instruction facilities,&#13;
which are needed to teach non-Chinese speaking minority children, are&#13;
lacking; both books and instructional equipment are scarce. The average&#13;
figure for project county schools meeting equipment standards for primary&#13;
level is 28 percent, increasing to 45 percent for lower secondary schools.&#13;
Distribution of teachers is uneven between urban and rural areas; the low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pay of minban2 teachers in poor communities results in low motivation&#13;
and a high turnover.&#13;
(c)   Primary schools in poor and minority areas often do not offer all six&#13;
grades. About 30 percent of the rural primary schools in project counties&#13;
are incomplete schools, i.e., they do not offer the full primnary program and&#13;
some offer only three or even fewer grades. Small villages are served by&#13;
"teaching points" which offer only two grades, 1 and 3 or 2 and 4:&#13;
counties in the proposed project currently have 9,726 (1993) such&#13;
"teaching points." Since complete primary schools may be located 4 to 5&#13;
kilometers away from small villages and boarding schools are costly,&#13;
many children tend to discontinue their education after attending an&#13;
incomplete school.&#13;
(d)   Gender disparity persists. Low enrollment of girls is most evident in&#13;
Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Sichuan, Tibet, Qinghai and Yunnan,&#13;
where a significant proportion of the population belong to national&#13;
minorities. The primary school completion rates for boys and girls in&#13;
these eight provinces in 1991-92 were 94.2 percent and 89.3 percent,&#13;
respectively, with girls constituting about 75 percent of dropouts from the&#13;
primary cycle. While the literacy rate for the male population of 15 years&#13;
and older in provinces was 87 percent in 1990, it was only 68 percent for&#13;
females.  Negative sociocultural attitudes among some communities&#13;
toward education of girls, the relatively poor recognition of the benefits of&#13;
education for girls, school fees which constitute a substantial proportion of&#13;
meager incomes, need to assist families with income-generating activities,&#13;
and parental hesitation to send girls to coeducational schools without&#13;
female teachers provide some of the reasons for lower enrollment and&#13;
retention rates for girls, especially those belonging to disadvantaged&#13;
population groups. The perceived lack of relevance of the school program&#13;
to the future development and occupational needs of girls also has&#13;
important bearing on attitudes to their schooling.&#13;
(e)   Inadequately planned and managed teacher training programs, both&#13;
at preservice and inservice levels, especially in poor rural areas with&#13;
relatively high levels of minority population, continue to hinder progress&#13;
towards universalization.  Nationally, 83 percent of primary school&#13;
teachers meet State-prescribed qualifications: regional disparities range&#13;
from 94 percent in Liaoning to 49 percent in Tibet. The average figure for&#13;
project counties is about 70 percent for primary school teachers and 47&#13;
percent for lower secondary. Training courses focus on content and&#13;
2 Minban teachers are community-supported teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
pedagogical techniques appropriate for large urban schools: few programs&#13;
offer trainees instructional methodologies suited to rural schools or&#13;
provide skills for adapting the curriculum, prescribed teaching materials,&#13;
and equipment to local conditions. Courses in multigrade teaching and&#13;
bilingual instruction are not widespread. About 37 percent of primary&#13;
school teachers are minban teachers, 88 percent of whom are in rural&#13;
areas. While significant efforts have been made to develop a training&#13;
network to periodically reorient teachers to curriculum and methodological&#13;
innovations, opportunities for inservice training for experienced teachers&#13;
in poor, remote and minority areas continue to be inadequate. Low ratios&#13;
of students to teachers (STR) bear testimony to the need to increase the&#13;
efficiency of teacher deployment and management: in project counties the&#13;
average STR for primary schools is 20.8:1 and for lower secondary&#13;
schools it is 15.5:1.&#13;
(f)   Inadequate  management capacity  for planning, implementing,&#13;
monitoring and evaluating reform programs for universalization of basic&#13;
education poses difficulties in poor counties. Several tiers of government&#13;
and administration are involved (central, provincial, county, village and&#13;
educational institution) which make management tasks complex:&#13;
appropriate structures are lacking to facilitate the systematic involvement&#13;
and assistance of the community in the planning and implementation of&#13;
primary education programs. At a number of management levels, there&#13;
are shortages of qualified and experienced planners, data-processors,&#13;
statisticians and analysts. Educational statistics and data on education&#13;
financing, on school facilities, and on staff deployment are often&#13;
incomplete or inaccurate and therefore provide insufficient information to&#13;
identify and resolve efficiency problems such as wasteful student to staff&#13;
ratios, low teaching loads, and low utilization rates of facilities and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
C.   GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS&#13;
1.12 The Central Government's overall approach toward education is to develop broad&#13;
principles and regulations to guide provincial and local governments in their county and&#13;
village level education services, so that they may implement the compulsory education&#13;
law using the resources available, and pursue their own targets, according to their own&#13;
means. Principles to be encouraged at the national level include efficiency, quality and&#13;
equity:&#13;
* efficiency is seen as increased cost-effectiveness in school management by&#13;
reducing high repetition and dropout rates, and adopting adequate student-&#13;
teacher ratios and teacher workloads; and by implementing better-managed&#13;
and better-conceived teacher training programs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
* quality improvement includes the introduction of newly developed sets of&#13;
more relevant and effective books for basic education, training of teachers to&#13;
use the new text materials and provision of more preservice and improved&#13;
inservice training for teachers; and&#13;
* equity issues include State efforts to subsidize economically undeveloped&#13;
areas so that they may introduce compulsory education and to encourage the&#13;
transfer of funds from provincial to local county governments.&#13;
1.13  Government's Education Strategy for Poverty Areas.  According to the&#13;
Education Law," the most important basic law in education and effective from&#13;
September 1, 1995, it is the Government's legal responsibility to support and assist the&#13;
development of education for national minorities as well as remote and poverty stricken&#13;
areas (Article 10). In keeping with the "Outline for Reform and Development of&#13;
Education in China," the State Council issued detailed suggestions in 1994 on the&#13;
implementation and planning for universalization of basic education, especially in poor&#13;
areas, which has been undertaken on the basis of different timescales, according to the&#13;
status of economic development as indicated in the following four categories:&#13;
(a)   Category 1: cities and selected rural areas with a fairly high level of&#13;
economic development and covering 40 percent of the nation's population.&#13;
Universalization targets in these areas are expected to be achieved by&#13;
1997.&#13;
(b)   Category 2: rural areas with medium level of economic development and&#13;
covering another 40 percent of the population. This category has already&#13;
achieved universal compulsory primary education and expects to meet&#13;
nine-year targets by 2000.&#13;
(c)   Category 3:  rural areas with low levels of economic development&#13;
covering 15 percent of the country's population. For about 5 percent of&#13;
this group, in areas with a good primary education system, the nine-year&#13;
goal should be achieved by 2000. For the remaining 10 percent of this&#13;
group, efforts will be made to implement five or six years of basic&#13;
education.&#13;
(d)   Category 4: exceptionally poverty-stricken areas covering 5 percent of&#13;
the population.&#13;
1.14  In order to reach overall universalization, targets proposed by the State Council,&#13;
through SEdC, will increase nonrecurrent categorical budgetary expenditures in all&#13;
provinces with nationally designated poor counties so that they can achieve universal&#13;
basic education by the year 2000. This is called the "Basic Education Program in Poor&#13;
Areas" and funding will be used for school construction, provision of teaching equipment&#13;
and library books, and teacher and principal training. (See para 1.15 for details.) The&#13;
annual special funds allocated by the Central Government for the program will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
increased to Y 1.0 billion in three years. As Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong,&#13;
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shandong have almost achieved the goal of&#13;
universalization of nine-year compulsory education, SEdC decided to implement the&#13;
program with a two-phase strategy:&#13;
&#149;  Phase One (1995-98) focuses on Category 2 poor counties in the 12 provinces&#13;
of Anhui, Fujian, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi,&#13;
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Sichuan. These provinces account for approximately 40&#13;
percent of China's population. There are 289 "8/7 Counties" in Phase One&#13;
with a population of some 110 million. The emphasis in Phase One is on&#13;
lower secondary schooling.&#13;
*  Phase Two (1995 through 1998 to 2000 and beyond) will focus on Category 3&#13;
counties in the nine provinces and autonomous regions of Gansu, Guangxi,&#13;
Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang and Yunnan,&#13;
accounting for some 190 million population. There are 273 "8/7 Counties" in&#13;
Phase Two with a poor population of some 70 million. By 2000, 66 percent&#13;
of Category 3 population would have been covered, which will mean that&#13;
almost 91 percent of the nation will have nine-year compulsory education&#13;
coverage. The government's strategy for Category 4 population areas is to&#13;
include it in Phase Two and to universalize three to four-year primary&#13;
education by 2000.&#13;
1.15  Total funding required to reach these goals by the year 2000 is estimated at Y 15.0&#13;
billion. The government efforts include: (a) earmarked national funds for construction&#13;
and rehabilitation of schools in poor areas; (b) upgrading the professional qualifications&#13;
of minban teachers so that they can be converted to gongban (government supported)&#13;
teachers; (c) specially targeted funds to support payment of charges for books, meals in&#13;
boarding schools, and some transportation costs; (d) training of education managers at the&#13;
provincial and county level in methods to achieve efficiency gains by using better&#13;
resource allocation strategies and practices; and, (e) introduction of tax reforms that&#13;
broaden and deepen the base for tax collection, earmark percentages for compulsory&#13;
education, and allow for targeting of funds toward the poorer sections of the provinces.&#13;
1.16  The "regular part" of the special fund amounted to Y 200 million in 1995. The&#13;
Central Government has recently decided to provide an "additional part"3 of the special&#13;
fund. The additional resources represent a substantial increase in the fund. For example,&#13;
by 1997, the additional resources will amount to Y 800 million and are four times as large&#13;
as the regular part of the fund. The additional special fund will be used for capital,&#13;
nonrecurrent costs of improvement in school facilities, and the provision of equipment,&#13;
furniture, and books. SEdC will adopt procedures used under the proposed project in&#13;
3 "Regular part" and "additional part" are ternis now used by SEdC and will be given more formal names&#13;
as the funding starts to be disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
distributing the special fund to provinces. For example, each province will submit a&#13;
proposal to SEdC, which will organize a national expert panel for reviewing the proposal.&#13;
The proposal will explain, among other things: (a) the development goals for compulsory&#13;
education; (b) resource requirements and financial feasibility; (c) the poor counties to be&#13;
included and the criteria for their inclusion (e.g., the counties should have good&#13;
management capacity and emphasize compulsory education); (d) how the special fund&#13;
will be used and distributed among the poor counties; and (e) the availability of matching&#13;
funds from provincial/prefecture/county levels (the total matching fund from provincial,&#13;
prefecture, and county levels should be two times that of the central fund). SEdC will&#13;
subsequently conduct supervision and monitoring of the utilization of the special fund in&#13;
the provinces.&#13;
1.17   Government Strategy for Minority Education. China's strategy for the&#13;
provision of education for ethnic minorities has undergone changes in the past four&#13;
decades. For instance, use of minority language as the initial medium of instruction in&#13;
primary schools has increased and Han language lessons are introduced later as a part of&#13;
bilingual teaching. Han Chinese is only fully used in later primary school grades as the&#13;
medium of instruction. The percentage of local content in primary school textbooks has&#13;
been increased, and levels of government-both local and national-support of teachers'&#13;
salaries in predominantly minority areas have been increased. Also, there has been since&#13;
the 1 970s an increased recruitment of minority teachers and school principals, and greater&#13;
efforts to train bilingual teachers.&#13;
1.18   Government policy on minority education can be seen in a number of other&#13;
systematic policy foci:&#13;
E Expanding Access through: construction, expansion and renovation of&#13;
township/village schools, teaching points and multigrade schools; mandating&#13;
universal six-year education in all minority regions or an elementary graduate&#13;
per household as a minimum requirement for remote and scattered rural&#13;
inhabitation; development of a Center4 Elementary School for every township&#13;
in each minority county and a Center Secondary School and a Literacy and&#13;
Vocational Training Center for each minority county;&#13;
*  Improving Delivery and Relevance of educational inputs by: improving&#13;
teacher selection and preparation in pedagogy, bilingual education, curriculum&#13;
revision and development of bilingual materials for minorities; and&#13;
*  Increasing the Resource Base by developing preferential policies of&#13;
increased national and provincial resource allocation targeted at basic&#13;
4 "Central" schools are generally town or county center level schools with additional faculty and funding&#13;
provided by the province or county to provide inservice teacher and principal training, local curricula&#13;
development and instructional equipment training sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
education in poor minority regions for specific programs to reduce repetition&#13;
and dropout rates.&#13;
1.19 Government Strategy for Promoting Education of Girls. In the "Law of the&#13;
People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women," which&#13;
became effective on April 3, 1992, the Government's policy position regarding the&#13;
education of girls is evident, seeing it as a societal responsibility:&#13;
* Schools and departments concerned shall, by implementing the relevant&#13;
regulations of the state, guarantee that women enjoy equal rights with men in&#13;
such aspects as starting school, entering a higher school, job assignment upon&#13;
graduation, conferment of academic degrees and dispatch for study abroad&#13;
(Article 15).&#13;
*  The governments, society and schools shall, in the light of the actual&#13;
difficulties of female school-age children or adolescents in schooling, take&#13;
effective measures to ensure that female school-age children or adolescents&#13;
receive compulsory education for the number of years locally prescribed&#13;
(Article 17).&#13;
1.20  In the "Education Law," the policy is: "all citizens, regardless of ethnic group,&#13;
race, sex, age, occupation, property status or religious belief, enjoy equal educational&#13;
opportunities according to law" (Article 9).&#13;
1.21  Several other measures have been taken to create a supportive environment for the&#13;
promotion of girls' education. Legal protection for the rights and interests of women and&#13;
girls is enshrined in the Compulsory Education Law and The Law Regarding the Health&#13;
Care of Mother and Infants. The State Council issued the "Outline for Women&#13;
Development in China" right before the UN Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing,&#13;
and further highlighted the importance of girls' education to women's development and&#13;
social status. Publicity drives have been initiated and the Chinese Government has&#13;
expressed its determination to keep girls' dropout rate and lack of attendance to under 2&#13;
percent. Several initiatives are being piloted in efforts to identify the best strategies:&#13;
among these are the Gansu Province project to improve primary education for girls and&#13;
disadvantaged groups; and a joint activity on the "Current Status, Issues and Strategies of&#13;
Girls' Education in the Rural Areas" conducted by research institutes in Ningxia, Gansu,&#13;
Guizhou and Qinghai Provinces. Teacher training is being strengthened, especially for&#13;
female teachers and principals. Social action in the form of financial assistance through&#13;
the "Hope Project" and the "Spring Bud Plan" illustrate national efforts to help retain&#13;
girls in school by lowering direct costs of schooling to parents.&#13;
1.22  In addition, a UNICEF-assisted project "Promoting Education of Girls in Poor&#13;
Areas," started in 1992, is being implemented in selected townships in 101 counties in&#13;
nine provinces (Anhui, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan&#13;
and Yunnan). Specific strategies adopted under the project include, amnong others,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
campaigns to generate parental awareness of the benefits of girls' education and to&#13;
overcome the socioeconomic barriers hindering participation of girls in education,&#13;
mobilization of parents and community leaders in activities designed to enhance&#13;
enrollment and retention of girls in schools, further increasing the proportion of trained&#13;
female teachers and principals and incorporation into the school curriculum learning&#13;
content that would enable girls to acquire the knowledge and skills relevant to their&#13;
socioeconomic needs; specific measures implemented in minority areas of Ningxia&#13;
include establishment of single-sex schools and single-sex classes and promoting&#13;
participation of religious leaders in enrollment campaigns and school improvement&#13;
activities. Activities under the proposed project would help in enhancing enrollment and&#13;
retention of girls in the areas covered.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECTOR&#13;
1.23   Sector Strategy. The Bank Group is in general agreement with the direction&#13;
taken by China in development of its educational system at all levels. It provides support&#13;
to this process by maintaining a dialogue on sectoral issues and options, and by&#13;
supporting selected activities which contribute to the efficiency and quality of that system&#13;
and to its relevance to national development objectives. In order to facilitate achievement&#13;
of these ends, IDA's sectoral focus is to:&#13;
*  support basic education with a strong focus on increasing access to quality&#13;
schooling for the poor, minorities and girls;&#13;
*  improve the effectiveness of teaching services including the upgrading of the&#13;
teacher training curricula;&#13;
*  assist in the design and implementation of reforms in the education sector, in&#13;
line with the "Guidelines for Development and Reform of China's Education&#13;
System," especially in seeking more equitable funding mechanisms, targeted&#13;
to basic education in poor rural areas; and&#13;
*  support institution building to increase the capacity of educational authorities&#13;
at all levels to carry out their responsibilities, especially under conditions of&#13;
increasing operational decentralization.&#13;
It is within the above context that the effort to improve and develop basic education, both&#13;
through the ongoing Educational Development in Poor Provinces (EDPP) Project&#13;
(Cr. 2339-CHA) and Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas (BEII) (Cr. 2651-CHA)&#13;
Project and the currently proposed project takes place.&#13;
1.24  Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector. In line with the above assistance&#13;
strategy, since 1981 the Bank Group has supported 16 projects in China that were either&#13;
devoted entirely to the education sector or had substantial education sector components.&#13;
The total loan and credit amount for education to date is $1,398.8 million. In the early&#13;
1980s, four successive higher education projects assisted expansion and quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
improvements in prominent universities, mainly key universities managed by SEdC, the&#13;
television universities and the larger provincially operated universities, and supported&#13;
founding the polytechnic system that has since proliferated. Since 1985, IDA has assisted&#13;
the Government in its effort to increase provision of textbooks, upgrade lower secondary&#13;
school (LSS) teachers and improve the conditions of vocational schools. It has also&#13;
financed a project in the relatively disadvantaged province of Gansu, managed by the&#13;
provincial government, part of which addresses the education sector. This latter project&#13;
has had smooth implementation, good results and will be completed in late 1996. Most&#13;
recently, support has been given to education at the municipal level in three medium-size&#13;
cities, at the university level to key science and engineering laboratories, at the county&#13;
level in the two basic education projects that cover 12 provinces and lower secondary&#13;
school teacher training in 15 provinces.&#13;
1.25   Sector studies related to education finance were completed in 1986, 1991 and&#13;
1995. Other sector studies were done on technical/vocational education and training for&#13;
labor markets in 1987 and 1993, respectively, and informal sector work on teacher&#13;
training was carried out in 1991.  These, combined with extensive experience in&#13;
preparing and supervising projects over the past decade, provide considerable background&#13;
for identification of sectoral needs and opportunities.&#13;
1.26  Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed operation is consistent with the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June 1, 1995. For the&#13;
social sectors, the CAS gives priority to the problems of the poorest areas, including basic&#13;
education and education for girls. In its focus on poverty alleviation and support for the&#13;
Government's 8/7 Plan, the Association is working in partnership with the Government to&#13;
improve the design and implementation of government efforts in reducing poverty. The&#13;
project would also be in line with the findings of the Bank Group's poverty alleviation&#13;
strategy which identifies investment in human capital, in particular targeted interventions&#13;
to the poor and vulnerable, as a key component of poverty alleviation efforts, leading to&#13;
healthier and smaller families, higher rates of adopting new agricultural technology, and&#13;
increased access to alternative off-farm employment.' The project incorporates IDA's&#13;
concern for improving the status of women in the development process, by supporting&#13;
targeted research activities and consequent interventions to increase girls' enrollments,&#13;
especially in minority areas. Implementation of the two ongoing projects in basic&#13;
education is proceeding smoothly and experience gained from them has been used in the&#13;
design of this proposed project. Through the project, IDA would deepen its support for&#13;
China's efforts to improve basic education in poor and remote areas, including those&#13;
inhabited by minority nationalities.&#13;

E. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.27 Lessons from Past Experience in China. Much of the same national level&#13;
SEdC project development team and the Chinese academic advisory group which worked&#13;
on the EDPP and BEII projects is intact and continues to work on the development of the&#13;
current project. This staffing continuity has facilitated incorporation into the proposed&#13;
project design of valuable lessons learned from the development and early&#13;
implementation of the EDPP and BEII projects. Likewise, many of the Bank Group and&#13;
Chinese staff who worked on the former project now work on the latter. The lessons&#13;
include:&#13;
* Projects are better designed and implemented when they concentrate on a&#13;
reduced number of provinces, and when provincial and county authorities are&#13;
involved in their design. This is especially true for projects that assist&#13;
provincial and locally-financed institutions;&#13;
* Provincial level counterpart funding must be assured from the beginning of&#13;
project, available early and sufficient to provide necessary startup funds for&#13;
county and village civil works which account for a large percentage of the first&#13;
half of project disbursements in such education projects;&#13;
- The project oversight and policy guidance role of the Chinese Experts Panel&#13;
(CEP) has been critical in making minor but necessary adjustments in project&#13;
design, advising Bank supervision missions, and resolving implementation&#13;
problems at the provincial and subprovincial levels;&#13;
* Provincial Education Commissions (PECs) should concentrate less on&#13;
quantitative targets and more on improving the quality of the project&#13;
supported preservice and inservice teacher training;&#13;
* Provinces have tended to overly rely on early and heavy use of force accounts&#13;
for small civil works projects in locations where National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procurement procedures would have been more appropriate&#13;
and economical;&#13;
* The Association and the Government need to work together in the evaluation&#13;
of education reforms.  Work has started on developing a standardized&#13;
mechanism to measure student attendance and indicators of educational&#13;
achievement progress; and&#13;
* National coordination of technical assistance, high level training, collection of&#13;
educational and project indicators, and dissemination of lessons learned is&#13;
necessary to achieve efficiencies of scale, and countrywide coherence in the&#13;
development and expression of education policy and national standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
1.28  Lessons from International Experience. Project completion reports as well as&#13;
project audits undertaken by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED), for&#13;
completed education projects worldwide include a variety of important lessons&#13;
(Annex 2), which can be summarized as follows: (a) follow-up projects pursuing similar&#13;
objectives to those of previous projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate&#13;
earlier achievements, which might otherwise falter and dissipate. Thus, follow-up&#13;
projects should be part of a long-term investment program with clearly defined objectives&#13;
based on sound sector work; (b) implementing agencies should have a strong sense of&#13;
project ownership; (c) borrowers should be committed to providing the necessary&#13;
resources to support basic education on a sustained basis; (d) project design should be&#13;
sufficiently flexible to accommodate mid-course corrections in scope, content and&#13;
approach (e) expert/advisory panels should be established to review implementation,&#13;
address implementation issues, and recommend on mid-course corrections, (f) increasing&#13;
access for poor and minority children and girls to quality primary education must be&#13;
addressed by innovative enrollment policies and student assistance programs.&#13;
1.29  The proposed project design benefited from the above lessons by incorporating&#13;
the following points: (a) the project began with a joint Bank/Borrower training course on&#13;
project design which included individuals from the preparation and implementing&#13;
agencies. The utilization of monitorable indicators was a component of the project&#13;
training course; (b) the borrower and provincial education authorities have been&#13;
responsible for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the provincial and county&#13;
levels to develop proposals based on local identification of issues and optimal solutions.&#13;
Because this is a repeater project, this process was facilitated by using experienced staff,&#13;
educational advisors and models from earlier projects; (c) a Chinese Experts Panel (CEP)&#13;
has been used to assist in the design of project components and will be used during&#13;
project implementation to provide ongoing high level professional monitoring of project&#13;
implementation; (d) a county financing study and household survey has been completed&#13;
to better understand what the necessary government and nongovernment commitment is&#13;
for sustaining appropriate levels of support for basic education; and (e) a component to be&#13;
included in the project aims at supporting dissemination of previous IDA- and UNICEF-&#13;
supported action-oriented research programs that identify innovative approaches to&#13;
improving access to basic education for girls, minorities and poor children.&#13;

2. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The main project objectives are to: (a) support the attainment of universal primary&#13;
education and the expansion of coverage of lower secondary education in poor and&#13;
minority areas; and (b) build stronger institutions responsible for education delivery. The&#13;
project will contribute to the Government's poverty reduction efforts by improving the&#13;
income earning potential of nearly 8.3 million children in some of the poorer counties in&#13;
China. The project will have a direct impact on approximately 46,000 schools and&#13;
448,000 teachers and staff, and will provide varying lengths of training for approximately&#13;
138,000 teachers and education managers.&#13;
2.2   The project will support the government's efforts to make primary education&#13;
universal by the year 2000 by putting more educational inputs into teaching points,&#13;
increasing the enrollment in complete schools, expanding multigrade and multisubject&#13;
teaching in rural areas, and reducing dropout rates of minority children through improved&#13;
bilingual educational programs.&#13;
2.3   Additionally, the project will focus special attention and resources on multigrade,&#13;
girls' and bilingual education. Development of new and the strengthening of existing&#13;
schools in villages in poor, remote and often inaccessible areas calls for increased use of&#13;
multigrade teaching and the construction of single classroom schools.  Likewise,&#13;
bilingual education will be augmented through the use of specially designed teacher&#13;
training programs which will focus on the use of minority languages in Hebei, Qinghai&#13;
and Gansu Provinces. These three provinces account for the largest proportion of the&#13;
approximately 9 percent minority population in the counties to be covered by the project.&#13;
The use of minority languages in bilingual education programs in Hebei, Qinghai and&#13;
Gansu is standard with the grade level at which the switch to the national language is&#13;
made (grades 4, 7 or 10) based on percentages of the minority people in a school&#13;
catchment area, the requests of the parents and the capabilities of the teachers to offer the&#13;
bilingual curriculum. It is to overcome this latter potential and, in some cases, real&#13;
constraint that the project will support the training of more bilingual teachers. Previous&#13;
IDA-supported projects have financed the development, writing, publishing and printing&#13;
of minority language textbooks, which are being used in minority population areas served&#13;
by the project. Special staff training and international study tours are to be organized at&#13;
the national and provincial level for this bilingual education component.&#13;
2.4   Project provinces will increase participation and completion rates of girls by&#13;
continuing with measures that have proved to be successful in the past while&#13;
implementing new measures. Steps to be undertaken by all project provinces include the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
mobilization of girls by conducting house-to-house visits and awareness campaigns&#13;
directed to parents by school or village committee officials. Campaigns, using several&#13;
channels including the media, will also reflect the legal obligations of parents as set out in&#13;
the Compulsory Education Law and include guidance and counseling for families. Some&#13;
local education bureaus will work with parents and principals in order to secure&#13;
commitments termed "guarantees" which will ensure active support for increasing&#13;
enrollment and retention of girls. Other measures common to all provinces will include&#13;
the piloting of the Student Assistance Program which will have categories of funding&#13;
specifically designated for girls as stipends and towards waiver of tuition fees and free&#13;
textbooks; increasing classroom space to accommodate larger numbers of pupils resulting&#13;
from increased numbers of girls entering schools; and dissemination of best practices&#13;
based either on provincial-level research or on experiences from UNICEF or UNESCO&#13;
sponsored activities. For example, the experience and research findings drawn from the&#13;
Pilot Project on Improving Girls' Education and Disadvantaged Groups conducted by the&#13;
Gansu Institute for Educational Research will be disseminated to project counties,&#13;
incorporated into the training programs for teachers, principals and administrators, and&#13;
used to develop guidelines and evaluation indicators for girls' education.&#13;
2.5    Measures specific to the local circumstances of provinces include prevocational,&#13;
potentially income-generating, skills training in the lower secondary curricula in order to&#13;
make schooling more relevant to employment, thus providing girls with a motive for&#13;
remaining in school such as Gansu encouraging girls to participate in the work-study&#13;
programs. Girls' education programs will be developed to give special help to girls in&#13;
schools, as in the case of Anhui. Efforts to improve transition rates from primary to lower&#13;
secondary will be made by putting in place a policy change which eradicates the fifth or&#13;
sixth grade primary school completion examination requirement and moves to a policy of&#13;
automatic promotion, with some areas such as Qinghai providing special quotas for girls,&#13;
guaranteeing them places at lower secondary and senior secondary levels (largely for the&#13;
prevocational and vocational stream). Special targets will be set for campaigns to put&#13;
girls in schools, such as Qinghai having mothers as their specific targets of their&#13;
campaigns directed to parents. In areas where Hui and Sala Muslim minorities&#13;
predominate, special measures to be undertaken under the project will include&#13;
experimenting with single-sex schools and single-sex classes, as well as increasing the&#13;
number of female teachers and principals. One province (Hebei) has stressed the need to&#13;
have flexible term schedules in order to fit in with seasonal demands for extra hands such&#13;
as harvest time. The issue of household chores that keep girls away from school would&#13;
be tackled by allowing girls more flexible timetabling for attendance of classes, by&#13;
providing peer assistance with house work as well as understanding class work, and by&#13;
permitting younger siblings to accompany their sisters to school.&#13;
2.6   The following indicators will be used to monitor implementation of this&#13;
component in relation to project targets. At primary level, these are enrollment,&#13;
repetition, completion and dropout rates; at the lower secondary level the indicators will&#13;
be transition, completion and dropout rates. The actual use of funds designated for girls&#13;
in the Student Assistance Fund will be monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
2.7   Education for Minorities.  There are 27 project counties in three project&#13;
provinces with minorities comprising over 10 percent of the population. Among these&#13;
project provinces, Qinghai has a proportion of minorities as high as 58 percent. As&#13;
improving education for the minorities is an objective of this project, project provinces&#13;
will pay special attention to increase participation and completion rates of the minorities.&#13;
This can be achieved by continuing with measures that have proved to be successful in&#13;
the past while implementing new measures. These measures include campaigns for&#13;
implementing the Compulsory Education Law among the minorities, regular home visits&#13;
to minority families, and specific social support or welfare systems for the minorities,&#13;
such as the Hope Project and Student Assistance Program, etc. In particular, Qinghai will&#13;
provide free textbooks to the minorities and include the building of boarding schools and&#13;
tent schools for the Zang minorities in their civil works plan.&#13;
2.8   To enhance their school attendance and retention rates, project provinces will&#13;
provide prevocational, potentially income-generating and skills training courses in lower-&#13;
secondary schools and strengthen bilingual education for the non-Han speaking&#13;
minorities to increase their employment opportunities. Project counties with a small&#13;
proportion of minorities will ensure that minority educational needs will not be neglected.&#13;
2.9   A component of minority education in teaching education, in addition to bilingual&#13;
education, will be developed to enhance teaching skills of teachers of the minorities and&#13;
their awareness of the needs of the minorities. Recent research outputs that can enhance&#13;
the understanding of minority needs and teaching skills relevant to the minorities will be&#13;
disseminated and incorporated into the existing teacher training curriculum for further&#13;
strengthening and advancement of minority education. The component of training&#13;
minority personnel will also cover school principals and administrators as this will have&#13;
significant impact on school policy-making and implementation that can attend to&#13;
minority needs.  There will be specific teacher training institutions taking the&#13;
responsibility of developing minority education, such as the Minority Junior Teachers'&#13;
College of Qinghai, the Minority Training Center of Northwest Normal University in&#13;
Gansu and the Teachers' College designated for minority education in Hebei.&#13;
2.10  The impact of this component of the project can be seen from a list of indicators&#13;
in project counties with minorities comprising over 10 percent of the population, such as&#13;
enrollment rate, dropout rate and completion rate.  Specific indicators for primary&#13;
students include admission rate in Grade 1, and literacy and numeracy rates in graduation&#13;
grades 5 or 6. Specific indicators for lower secondary students include transition and&#13;
repetition rates. The actual use of funds targeted to minorities in the Student Assistance&#13;
Program will be monitored.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESIGN AND PREPARATION&#13;
2.11   Project Design. The key educational issues to be addressed by the project were&#13;
identified bv studies carried out jointly by the Association and members of the Chinese&#13;
education research community as well as from the EDPP and BEII projects. Likewise,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
identification of the key poverty intervention issues to be addressed in the project resulted&#13;
from studies carried out jointly by the Association and Chinese social scientists. These&#13;
studies were discussed with SEdC. Priorities for project focus were determined in the&#13;
course of project identification and preparation.  Special attention was given to&#13;
procedures for selecting project provinces and, more importantly, counties (including&#13;
those with substantial minority populations). Emphasis was also placed on the design of&#13;
appropriate training and management development programs, to formulation of national&#13;
seminars and to setting up of a system to carry out the innovation programs provided for&#13;
under the project. All of these topics were discussed and settled upon jointly by the&#13;
Association and Government staff during project preparation and appraisal.&#13;
2.12  The project has been designed to further develop the borrower's capacity to&#13;
prepare and implement education projects in the future, whether supported with&#13;
government funding and categorical6 grants (see paras. 1.14-1.15 for details), or donor&#13;
agency financing. Building on the sector work which informed the design of the EDPP&#13;
and BEII projects as well as the current proposed project, IDA and SEdC have prepared&#13;
seven subprojects, one for each province.&#13;
2.13   This approach will be expanded and refined for the preparation of possible future&#13;
education projects, using revised and updated project identification, coverage selection,&#13;
subproject preparation, project implementation, and monitoring instruments now being&#13;
used in the current project.  This process will also allow for the utilization and&#13;
dissemination of policies and actions which come from this project's innovation program&#13;
well beyond the confines of provinces supported by this project. Goals such as decreased&#13;
girls' dropout before completion of grade five, increased usage of bilingual teaching&#13;
materials and wider use of multigrade teaching, will take time to gain a level of general&#13;
acceptance and the program approach will provide the continuing support for such policy&#13;
development for a period longer than the life of this one project.&#13;
2.14 Borrower Involvement in Project Preparation. Based on experience with the&#13;
previous projects, SEdC organized three working groups which were instrumental in&#13;
project preparation and will be used in project implementation (para. 4.1). These groups&#13;
are: (a) a Project Working Group, comprising working level staff from SEdC's&#13;
Departments of Finance, Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO), Minority&#13;
Education, Basic Education, Equipment, Teacher Training and Supervision, which has&#13;
been responsible for organizing all project preparatory activities; (b) the Project Leading&#13;
Group, comprising the directors of departments represented in the first group and&#13;
responsible for providing guidance and coordination and resolving major implementation&#13;
issues that may arise; and (c) the Project Expert Consultative Group, comprising 7-9 non-&#13;
SEdC experts specializing in basic education, minority/bilingual education, teacher&#13;
6 Categorical funding refers to special targeted funding from the central government for school&#13;
construction and rehabilitation, and teacher training in national minority areas, national poor counties,&#13;
and former revolutionary base areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
training, curriculum development, civil works, equipment and education management,&#13;
which advised and made suggestions on project preparation. Directors of project&#13;
implementation units from Yunnan, Shanxi and Hubei Provinces, all in the earlier EDPP&#13;
project, are members of the Project Working Group to ensure continuous input into the&#13;
development of the programs in the project-supported provinces as well as training of&#13;
new project implementation staff.&#13;
2.15  SEdC organized a project preparation stakeholder meeting for the seven project&#13;
provinces as well as national and provincial financial and planning agencies. Meeting&#13;
members agreed on the basic project design, outlined the project preparation process and&#13;
provided each of the provinces with a project proposal outline and financing format&#13;
derived from the preparation of the earlier Basic Education II project and subsequently&#13;
modified by both SEdC and the IDA preparation team. First drafts of the provincial&#13;
project proposals were received by SEdC and reviewed with the Association preparation&#13;
assistance team during a SEdC mission to Washington where the latter participated in&#13;
three weeks of training in project design, cost table preparation and project&#13;
implementation management.&#13;
2.16  During the Washington meetings, the Bank preparation team tentatively agreed to&#13;
the inclusion of the seven provinces identified by SEdC, recommended that the number&#13;
of counties in the project be set at a maximum of 125 and be limited to counties identified&#13;
by the State Council Leading Group for Poverty Reduction as National Level Poor&#13;
Counties (8/7 Counties from the National 8/7 Plan to Reduce Poverty 1994-2000).&#13;
Project preparation teams from all seven provinces took part in a May 1995 project&#13;
design study tour to Hubei Province to review the progress in two pilot counties of the&#13;
EDPP. SEdC and IDA project preparation teams took part in the mid-term review of the&#13;
EDPP project and incorporated lessons learned from the first period of implementation of&#13;
that project (para. 1.27).&#13;
2.17  Local Participation in Project Design. During project preparation, Chinese&#13;
education authorities and IDA staff systematically interviewed selected parents,&#13;
grandparents and village authorities from some 17 townships and villages in poor&#13;
counties of Qinghai and Gansu Provinces to learn local reaction to, and gather additional&#13;
information that might inform, the tentative project design. A specific effort was made to&#13;
solicit input from people in minority areas with a view toward enhancing the project&#13;
responsiveness to the needs and aspirations of children in these areas. The findings from&#13;
the interviews can be summarized as follows:&#13;
*  Only by acquiring literacy and numeracy skills will the children be able to&#13;
escape the poverty with which their parents/grandparents have had to live;&#13;
*  Basic education in rural poor areas is primarily to acquire skills necessary to&#13;
contribute to the local economy and secondarily to provide an educational&#13;
foundation for higher education;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
*  Mastery of national language is essential in providing the ability of school-&#13;
leavers to move from poverty areas, even within a province, to where the jobs&#13;
are;&#13;
*  Initial instruction in the mother language is important to retain awareness of&#13;
minority culture and to be able to talk to family members;&#13;
*  The project should place first and strong emphasis on eliminating dangerous&#13;
schools and providing good new classrooms which will attract children and&#13;
good new teachers to the schools;&#13;
*  Increasing teachers' qualifications, especially in bilingual education skills, is&#13;
also important;&#13;
*  Of lesser importance but still necessary is the provision of school furniture&#13;
and teaching equipment;&#13;
*  It is important for the curriculum to include stories of local heroes, local&#13;
model citizens and the history and stories of the local culture; and&#13;
* Education of girls is important so that they can learn life skills that enable&#13;
them to contribute to the local economy.&#13;
2.18   Components of the project (e.g., increased provision of bilingual teacher training,&#13;
procurement of tent schools, increased emphasis on local content in minority language&#13;
textbooks, training of minority headmasters, student assistance programs especially&#13;
focused on girls, increased girls' enrollment targets, etc.) have been especially designed&#13;
for the small number of minority children (about 7 percent of the total) in the project.&#13;
Further, provincial and county selection criteria contain a weighting system that ensured&#13;
that indigenous people will benefit from the project. Targeting project investments away&#13;
from county municipalities and toward townships and villages further assures increased&#13;
project coverage of indigenous peoples for it is in these areas that they generally live.&#13;
Additionally, the previous basic education project, BEII, supported the development and&#13;
distribution of minority language textbooks and teachers' guides. This development&#13;
work specifically focused on strengthening the already existing local content portion of&#13;
the minority language textbooks especially in language, history and geography. The local&#13;
content portion includes minority cultural stories, heroes and history. Through continued&#13;
support to teacher training and free distribution to poor children of these minority&#13;
language textbooks and teachers' guides, the project will continue the Association's&#13;
earlier efforts to expand access to quality basic education for minority children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   The project will, over a period of five years, provide assistance through: (a) an&#13;
institutional component directly supporting the delivery of educational inputs (i.e., civil&#13;
works, equipment and book procurement, teacher and administrator training) at the&#13;
primary and lower secondary schools in the participating provinces; (b) a management&#13;
component providing for better operational control of the educational system at the&#13;
school, county and provincial level; and (c) a central component that would provide&#13;
national level management training and support dissemination of the good results of&#13;
previous educational experiments, and a research project to study student assessment and&#13;
establish a CEP. The latter component aims at supporting national capacity building and&#13;
coordination of activities common to the project provinces by strengthening SEdC's&#13;
ability to implement and replicate basic education projects. The student assessment&#13;
study, dissemination program and the student assistance program will in part be carried&#13;
out at the provincial level. A rough percentage distribution of project base-cost financing&#13;
will be: civil works-64 percent, equipment, books and furniture-24 percent, and&#13;
technical assistance- 12 percent. A rough percentage distribution of project financing by&#13;
education level will be: primary education-57 percent, lower secondary school-40&#13;
percent, management-3 percent. The main features of each component are described&#13;
below.&#13;
A. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
3.2   Project Area and Selection Criteria. The project would be implemented in 124&#13;
counties in the seven provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Henan, Hebei, Jilin and&#13;
Qinghai. The main criteria used in selecting the provinces were the number of poor&#13;
counties [counties identified as being National Poor Counties in the State Council's&#13;
"National 8/7 Poverty Reduction Plan (1994-2000)"] in the province, level of teacher&#13;
qualifications, percentage of minority population, primary school completion rate, and&#13;
girls' enrollment (see Annexes 3 and 4 for list of provinces, counties and key provincial&#13;
benchmark indicators).  The main criteria used in selecting project counties were:&#13;
inclusion on the national or provincial list of poor counties; relative concentration of&#13;
minority population among overall county population; poverty indicators such as rural&#13;
income per capita, public expenditure for education as a percentage of provincial&#13;
expenditure and books per pupil at primary level; and teaching and management needs&#13;
such as percentages of repetition, primary enrollment, and girls' enrollment, transition&#13;
rate from primary to secondary education, and percentage of qualified teachers.&#13;
(Selection criteria and their numerical weighting can be found in Annex 5.)&#13;
3.3   Project Counties. The project counties comprise 21 percent of the 592 national-&#13;
level poverty counties and have a total population of about 59 million, of which 15.6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
million are considered poor by the Chinese Government. This is approximately 16&#13;
percent of the number of people the World Bank estimates remain in poverty in China or&#13;
20 percent of the number estimated by the Government. The primary and lower&#13;
secondary schools in project counties include about 8.3 million students. With the&#13;
completion of this basic education project, IDA will have supported the basic education&#13;
programs of 60 percent of China's national level poverty counties.&#13;
3.4   Sub-County Focus. As the primary focus of the project is to build up education&#13;
capacity in poor areas of China and is restricted to national poverty counties, an important&#13;
consideration is the targeting of project investments at levels within counties where the&#13;
greatest poverty exists. Earlier Bank Group sector work indicated that this is generally at&#13;
the town and village levels outside the county center. Therefore, project investments will,&#13;
for the most part, be made at the town and village and not the county, city or municipality&#13;
levels. With certain exceptions discussed below, project investments and training will be&#13;
focused at the subcounty level.&#13;
3.5   Sparsely Populated Counties. In Qinghai Province, several of the project-&#13;
supported counties have very low population density and are largely inhabited by&#13;
nomadic groups that move seasonally with their yak and sheep herds. During project&#13;
preparation, an IDA mission visited several of these counties to better understand the&#13;
special requirements of providing educational services to the (largely minority) children&#13;
in these counties. The local county and provincial authorities recommended that the&#13;
project support the buying of tent schools, which would be set up where the nomadic&#13;
group spent their late spring, summer and early autumn grazing, while at the same time&#13;
continuing support for county municipal schools in locations where the herds, and&#13;
children, winter. International experience has shown that locating schools close to where&#13;
children live, especially young children and primary school-aged girls, is important to&#13;
increasing school enrollments. The combination of movable and permanent schools&#13;
offers a solution that has been effective in China. Therefore, in some Qinghai counties&#13;
some educational inputs will be designated for county municipalities.&#13;
3.6   Impact on Nonproject Counties. Because the need for increased educational&#13;
inputs manifestly exists in poor counties not covered by the project, the provincial&#13;
governments of Hebei, Anhui and Gansu have provided financing and action plans for&#13;
educational inputs to national poverty counties not supported by the project. (See&#13;
Annex 6 for the levels of committed provincial funding for nonproject counties). At&#13;
negotiations assurances were obtained that participating provinces will. (a) implement&#13;
acceptable programs for nonproject counties designed to ensure the continued&#13;
achievemeni of acceptable educational targets in these counties during the&#13;
implementation of the project; (b) monitor these programs on the basis of indicators&#13;
acceptable to the Association, and (c) prepare and furnish to the Borrower for&#13;
forwarding to IDA at project mid-term a report on this monitoring.&#13;
3.7  In this fashion the IDA credit inputs, coupled with the provinces' own financing&#13;
for nonproject supported counties, will provide a broader program approach to strengthen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
basic education in all of a province's poor counties. This approach will also increase the&#13;
institutional capacity of the SEdC and other provinces to prepare further poverty-focused&#13;
basic education projects.&#13;
B. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Institutional Component (Base cost $142.5 million)&#13;
3.8   This component will include facilities upgrading, instructional equipment, and&#13;
staff upgrading.  Training in this component relates directly to training classroom&#13;
teachers, school principals, trainers and local education administrators to provide better&#13;
instruction in and leadership of the education institutions at the provincial, county and&#13;
village levels.&#13;
3.9   Facilities Upgrading (Base cost $94.9 million). The project will finance civil&#13;
works including renovation, rehabilitation, some necessary new construction of primary&#13;
and lower secondary schools, and the procurement of a small number of tent schools. Of&#13;
the 26 million square meters (mi2) of primary and lower secondary school premises now&#13;
existing in the 124 counties to be assisted in the project, about 5 percent is in such poor or&#13;
dangerous condition that complete replacement may be necessary, while another 4&#13;
percent requires extensive repairs. Lesser repairs, needed for a further 7 percent of the&#13;
existing facilities, will be paid for entirely from project government counterpart funds.&#13;
The buildings in the worst condition are generally old, decayed timber or timber and&#13;
adobe structures, whose renovation, even where practicable, would not be cost effective.&#13;
Newer school buildings are, typically, three-story concrete frame and brick structures&#13;
generally planned and built in compliance with SEdC space planning and construction&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
3.10   Schools in the project will also require an additional 1.57 million m2 of facilities&#13;
to adequately accommodate SEdC's plans for nine-year basic education goals.&#13;
3.11   Architectural and engineering design work for buildings construction and repair&#13;
has been undertaken, based on SEdC's space norms and construction guidelines, which&#13;
are cost effective and satisfactory to the Association. Construction will be handled by&#13;
county construction bureaus or companies with the support of the provincial construction&#13;
departments or-where capabilities at the county level are inadequate-entirely by the&#13;
latter.&#13;
3.12   The special characteristics and needs of the nomadic peoples in Qinghai have&#13;
resulted in project support for tent schools in the high plateau areas frequented by yak and&#13;
sheep herdsmen (para. 3.5). The tent school includes a one-room classroom with&#13;
blackboard, heating stove and chairs and desks, and a teacher's living tent. These tent&#13;
schools have been designed by the local provincial education construction units taking&#13;
into consideration local customs and practice (nomadic families live in similar tents),&#13;
portability and local construction capability. The project will support procurement of 40&#13;
such tent schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.13  Implementation of the civil works portion of the project will be phased over five&#13;
years and will be integrated with that of such essentially related activities as the&#13;
procurement of teaching equipment and furniture and the training of teachers. In the&#13;
phasing process, priority will be given to the replacement of dangerous structures.&#13;
School maintenance plans will be prepared annually for organizing maintenance of the&#13;
primary and lower secondary schools assisted by this project. The provinces furnished&#13;
acceptable maintenance plans for project schools including funding levels for the duration&#13;
of the project at negotiations.&#13;
3.14 Instructional Equipment, Furniture, and Books (Base cost $36.2 million).&#13;
The project will upgrade the instructional equipment in those schools with currently&#13;
incomplete sets of equipment. The majority of schools in the project have not received&#13;
any equipment in the last 10 years. Because the emphasis has been on building and&#13;
repairing schools, poor counties find themselves at a great disadvantage in terms of&#13;
school equipment. This fact creates serious discrepancies between the kind of teaching&#13;
that takes place in more affluent places and the rote memory/passive teaching one sees in&#13;
small village schools where there are no posters, maps, or simple measuring devices or&#13;
materials to conduct the simple electricity and optics experiments included in the&#13;
curriculum.&#13;
3.15  The project will attempt to decrease these disparities by upgrading those schools&#13;
with incomplete equipment kits to Standard Three level, and similarly to upgrade existing&#13;
Standard Three schools to Standard Two. SEdC classifies equipment needs ("Standard&#13;
Levels") by school size, centrality and teacher training responsibility; conducts periodic&#13;
surveys to assess current levels and new procurement needs; and has, for this project,&#13;
identified specific requirements for project-supported schools. Equipment lists have been&#13;
prepared for the project by SEdC and reviewed and approved by the CEP using criteria&#13;
and procedures acceptable to the Association. Key central schools in project-supported&#13;
counties will be the basis of an inservice training program in equipment utilization.&#13;
Teachers in key schools will train other teachers and organize science clubs and science&#13;
fairs. Library books will be provided to both primary and lower secondary schools.&#13;
3.16  Staff Upgrading (Base cost $11.4 million). An extensive program of staff&#13;
upgrading, largely incountry, will be provided under the project. Human resource&#13;
development is central to the success of the project. Currently, the design and delivery of&#13;
appropriate initial and inservice training for teachers and administrators suffer from an&#13;
overreliance on one-time initial training, too exclusive a faith in the efficacy of&#13;
correspondence education without appropriate and interactive social phases, a lack of&#13;
appropriate models, networks and structures to reach out to the poorest and most remote&#13;
schools, and an emphasis on program content that is at best a proxy for the real skills,&#13;
knowledge and expertise needed by teachers and administrators.&#13;
3.17  Under the project, nearly 76,000 person-years of incountry training for&#13;
approximately 138,000 participants will be carried out through one-year and short-term&#13;
inservice courses. A limited number of study tours will be provided in such areas as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
girls', bilingual and multigrade education as well as student assessment. In setting&#13;
itineraries for the study tours, priority will be given to selecting domestic locations that&#13;
are good examples of innovative policies or activities although some international visits&#13;
may be considered if better examples exist abroad. [See Annex 8 for a detailed Technical&#13;
Assistance (TA) Plan.] Attention has been given in the design of the Terms of Reference&#13;
(TORs) for the training programs to: (a) duration of professional development; (b) the&#13;
content and processes of programs; and (c) the style, pace and mode of delivery.&#13;
3.18   Five major groups of staff will be upgraded: (a) elementary and lower secondary&#13;
teachers; (b) principals of primary and lower secondary schools, including those in&#13;
remote and rural areas and those facing challenges of bilingual or multicultural education;&#13;
(c) administrators at local, provincial and national levels; (d) technicians and librarians in&#13;
schools and colleges; and (e) trainers themselves.&#13;
3.19   Teachers and administrators will receive in-service modes of training delivery,&#13;
with content and processes of both types to be reviewed, updated and tested for their&#13;
direct relevance to the work tasks of participants. Special efforts will be made during the&#13;
life of the project to offer an initial qualification to the group of teachers currently&#13;
teaching without qualifications.&#13;
3.20  Improving the quality of teacher training is essential to keep up with the efforts of&#13;
universalizing basic education. In addition to strengthening teachers' subject areas,&#13;
special attention will be paid to improve the quality of training by: (a) providing teachers&#13;
with sufficient understanding in psychology of learning and children's psychological&#13;
development for developing teachers' capacity of conducting student-centered leaming&#13;
activities, (b) providing a component of gender education and minority education to&#13;
enhance teachers' awareness of their needs, and (c) placing emphasis on teaching&#13;
methods, especially those relevant to rural and minority education. Moreover, research&#13;
outputs related to gender and minority education will be incorporated into the teacher&#13;
training courses and materials to keep teachers informed of the latest development in&#13;
these areas. Project provinces will keep track of the needs for the provision of teachers&#13;
specializing in various subject areas that emerge in the course of educational expansion;&#13;
and modify the training targets accordingly.&#13;
3.21  Inservice training will include courses in: (a) academic qualification of current&#13;
teachers; (b) certification of current teachers by upgrading current skills; (c) multigrade&#13;
teaching; (d) bilingual teaching; (e) laboratory teacher training; (f) librarian training;&#13;
(g) teaching methodology; and (h) principal training, especially of minority principals.&#13;
Management Improvement Component (Base cost $1.2 million)&#13;
3.22   This component will develop management capabilities for the education system at&#13;
the central, provincial and institutional levels through staff training, the provision of&#13;
equipment and expert services. It will include three subcomponents: (a) the training of&#13;
local education management authorities; (b) the training of local project implementation&#13;
authorities; and (c) the development of an education information management system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.23  Local Education Management Training. The capacity of the education offices&#13;
in the seven project provinces and counties to deal with education management will be&#13;
enhanced through extensive incountry training. Training will be provided in modem&#13;
techniques and methods of education management and resource utilization, and cover&#13;
development of appropriate policies and problem-solving skills, especially for those&#13;
problems prevalent in remote, rural, poor, and minority areas.  Additionally, this&#13;
subcomponent will provide support for training provincial level education planners.&#13;
Training will focus on identifying and assessing the changing patterns of social demand&#13;
and appropriate types and quality of education delivery systems to respond to China's&#13;
rapid economic and social development. The training will focus on the county and&#13;
prefecture levels and will include workshops (with SEdC participation) for education&#13;
managers, administrators, and planners. The training will include study of international&#13;
experience, advanced planning techniques and methods focused on the specific&#13;
requirements of each province, local skills building, and the use of computers and&#13;
software for relevant planning models.&#13;
3.24  Project Management Training.  This subcomponent will develop project&#13;
implementation capacity in each participating county including training in project&#13;
implementation in civil works, procurement, project launch, accounting, and project&#13;
monitoring. The training takes into consideration the experience of the Association's two&#13;
earlier basic education projects as well as other Association-supported provincial-based&#13;
education projects. Each province has established a project steering committee and&#13;
working group to train county staff, and a training program with timing of activities and&#13;
including required provincial and interprovincial workshops and necessary local&#13;
specialist services.&#13;
3.25 Education Management Information System. An education management&#13;
information system (EMIS) has been established in the provincial education conmmissions&#13;
(PECs) in almost all the provinces in China. This project will support establishing an&#13;
EMIS in the PEC and participating counties of all project-supported provinces using&#13;
previously established SEdC standards for hardware and software procurement as well as&#13;
training. Training for the EMIS operators and the end-users will be scheduled according&#13;
to the timing of hardware procurement and software development and will cover&#13;
traditional software and hardware training, data collection, processing and other related&#13;
areas such as surveys, sampling and advanced techniques of statistical applications;&#13;
advanced methods of education planning and analysis and applications of relevant&#13;
computer software. While some training will be carried out at the center, experience in&#13;
the EDPP project suggests that individual provinces can be expected to carry out the bulk&#13;
of the training using local resources and local staff. Therefore, the current proposed&#13;
project will increase over previous projects the amount of local training that is carried out&#13;
at the provincial level. SEdC standards will be used in the training and equipment&#13;
procurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
The Central Component (Base cost $4.7 million)&#13;
3.26 The central component will: (a) provide national level management training for&#13;
provincial trainers, education managers and administrators and project implementation&#13;
staff including a limited number of study tours; (b) support a dissemination program&#13;
which would disseminate the good results of previous educational experiments; (c) carry&#13;
out a national level study of student assessment; (d) monitor the most efficient way to&#13;
establish a student assistance program; and (e) support a CEP that will coordinate and&#13;
oversee the central component activities in cooperation with the Provinces, and SEdC.&#13;
The student assessment study, dissemination program and the student assistance program&#13;
will in part be carried out at the provincial level.&#13;
3.27 Management Training&#13;
(a)   Education Management. Administrators at the provincial, county, and&#13;
township level will participate in extensive incountry training in education&#13;
management and resource utilization, and development of policies and&#13;
problem-solving skills, especially for problems prevalent in remote, rural,&#13;
poor and minority areas.  Training of provincial level staff will be&#13;
provided at the national level. These administrators will then train the&#13;
subprovincial level administrators, which will take place at the provincial&#13;
level and below.&#13;
(b)   Project Management.  Project managers of  Bank Group-supported&#13;
projects require training at all levels to ensure smooth project&#13;
implementation. SEdC will need to work with each province to develop a&#13;
training program for the provincial, county, township and, if possible,&#13;
village level project implementation units in civil construction, equipment,&#13;
book and furniture procurement, teacher training, disbursement and all&#13;
other relevant training for project implementation.  At negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that the Borrower will carry out national level&#13;
training programs in accordance with an action plan acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.28  Dissemination Program.  The dissemination program  will focus on the&#13;
documentation, dissemination, piloting and evaluation of previously supported&#13;
educational experiments and pilot projects. Past experience in Bank Group-supported&#13;
projects indicates inadequate efforts in dissemination of useful results or examples of&#13;
successful experiments, and the dissemination program aims to resolve this problem. The&#13;
Dissemination Program will also support a limited number of research studies such as&#13;
those listed in Annex 9. The dissemination program will be monitored by the CEP, but&#13;
largely administered and implemented at the provincial level.  (See Annex 9 for&#13;
implementation  guidelines.)   At negotiations, SEdC  furnished the preliminary&#13;
dissemination program plans for approval by the Association.&#13;
3.29  Chinese Experts Panel.  A CEP has been established to provide ongoing&#13;
guidance and advice to SEdC and the provinces on project implementation and issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
related to the project. The CEP will administer the national level dissemination program&#13;
and monitor any of the national level research activities supported by the project, and&#13;
monitor the implementation of provincially administered student assistance programs and&#13;
report to SEdC and the provinces on their observations. The Terms of Reference (TOR)&#13;
for the CEP were finalized at appraisal and include: (a) the responsibilities of the panel;&#13;
(b) qualification of panel members; (c) panel activities; (d) the panel work plan; and&#13;
(e) outcomes of panel work. The TOR include information on the plans and a budget for&#13;
a Secretariat that will support the daily work of the Panel (see Annex 10 for TOR).&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CEP would be maintained with TORs and&#13;
resources acceptable to the Association.&#13;
3.30  Student Assistance Programs. As a subcomponent of this project, a student&#13;
assistance program will be piloted in all of the project counties. Between approximately&#13;
I and 5 percent of the counterpart funds of the various project provinces will be allocated&#13;
to this subcomponent. The counterpart funds for this subcomponent will be put into a&#13;
trust fund and the interest proceeds from the trust fund will be used to provide assistance&#13;
to approximately 34,000 primary and lower-secondary students from poor backgrounds.&#13;
Such students will not receive cash payment. Depending on their need, they will receive&#13;
varying amounts of reduction in their payment to school for textbook costs,&#13;
miscellaneous school fees, and other schooling-related costs. While observing the&#13;
general guidelines of SEdC, the project provinces will develop their own guidelines for:&#13;
(a) eligibility for assistance and selection procedure; (b) targeting and assistance (for&#13;
female and minority students and for primary education); (c) financing of the trust fund;&#13;
and (d) management and monitoring of the program. It is estimated that, at the primary&#13;
level, the subcomponent will cover between 6.4 and 27.7 percent of the poor students in&#13;
the project counties annually.&#13;
3.31   The project provinces are expected to: (a) use a higher proportion (e.g., 60 to 70&#13;
percent) of the interest proceeds from the trust fund on primary students; (b) give a higher&#13;
priority to poor female and minority students, especially in counties with relatively low&#13;
female and minority participation in compulsory education; (c) consider the use of a&#13;
small part of the central compulsory education special fund as seed money for the&#13;
program; and (d) develop a program plan for 1996-2000 (to indicate the coverage of poor&#13;
students over time and the financing sources, including the trust fund, the Hope&#13;
Foundation, work-study program and production in school, etc.). The central component&#13;
of this project will monitor and evaluate this program.&#13;
3.32  Pupil Learning  Achievement Study.   Information  on  pupil learning&#13;
achievements can provide a qualitative indicator to assess system performance both&#13;
educationally and economically. It provides a method for assessing the efficiency with&#13;
which government and local resources for education are utilized. If pupils achieve&#13;
curriculum objectives such as goals set for literacy and numeracy, then the system may be&#13;
said to be working well. Other measures from which inferences are made relative to&#13;
system efficiency include data on teacher qualifications, enrollment rates, completion and&#13;
repetition rates. Because national data on primary school learning achievements are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
available, other measures can be used for providing baseline information in the project.&#13;
These include enrollment rates, first grade repetition rates, dropout rates, elementary and&#13;
lower secondary school completion rates, transition rates from primary to secondary&#13;
school, all of which are disaggregated by gender; pupil-teacher ratios, number of&#13;
complete primary schools, and teacher qualification rates. Measures that indicate how the&#13;
system serves minorities are admission rates for primary and lower secondary schools.&#13;
Number of teaching sites available is also taken as a positive mark in terms of providing&#13;
access to the early stages of schooling for those living in remote areas including the rural&#13;
poor, minority groups, and nomads.&#13;
3.33   The project will conduct a research study that will examine the various existing&#13;
pupil learning achievement schemes currently being used in China, and make&#13;
recommendations on the most effective scheme/s to be followed in the project. The&#13;
research study will be carried out by educational research units in the seven provinces&#13;
with the assistance of a Chinese national level research institution or university. The CEP&#13;
will supervise and provide oversight for this research study and the provincial pilot&#13;
activities that result from the study's recommendations. A progress report of this study&#13;
will be available by mid-term with final results at the end of the project.&#13;
Environmental Aspects and Program Objective Categories&#13;
3.34  No negative environmental impact from the project is foreseen (the project is&#13;
rated as "C"). Likewise, no resettlement or land acquisition is foreseen in that all new&#13;
civil works will be rehabilitation or repair of schools on existing school sites. Improved&#13;
access to and quality of basic education will enhance the ability of the poor to take&#13;
advantage of the opportunities presented by economic growth, either in their own&#13;
counties or areas of faster economic development. Improved overall access to education&#13;
will increase girls' enrollments. The project, through its targeted training programs, will&#13;
increase the numbers of women teachers and principals and thus encourage enrollment&#13;
and retention of girls in schools. It has been shown that improved quality of education in&#13;
general also increases the retention of girls, with resultant economic and social benefits.&#13;
Special attention has been paid, through a participatory process, to design the project so&#13;
as to ensure that the minority beneficiaries fully benefit under the project, in accordance&#13;
with the requirements of the Bank Group's Operational Directive 4.20 (see paras. 2.11&#13;
and 2. 16).&#13;
3.35   Parental participation in the design of the project, especially in minority areas was&#13;
an element of project preparation. Village school committees on which parents sit are&#13;
important in supporting many school activities, including organizing school construction&#13;
and repairs, payment of minban teachers, ensuring that all children enroll in school and&#13;
introduction of local content into the teaching curriculum. Parental participation in their&#13;
children's schools can be seen through direct and indirect means. Direct participation of&#13;
parents can be seen by their involvement in meetings, usually two or three times every&#13;
term, to discuss students' studies and extracurricular activities at school. During these&#13;
meetings, parents can provide suggestions and comments to the school administration on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30 -&#13;
issues of import to them as parents. Teachers also make approximately 20 visits each&#13;
term to homes to discuss with the parents the child's study program and performance.&#13;
This provides parents with another opportunity to have input into their child's learning&#13;
experience. Indirect means of communication with parents occur through mailings to&#13;
parents to keep them informed of issues so that if there are common problems the parents&#13;
can meet with school officials to work toward resolution. It will be important for village&#13;
school committees to continue to function during the life of the project and contribute to&#13;
the success of the project implementation. The CEP should, on their regular site visits,&#13;
meet with village school committees to ensure that they continue to contribute to the&#13;
implementation of the project at the school level. The CEP will report to Bank&#13;
supervision missions on the quality and quantity of parental participation in the village&#13;
school committees and the committee's contribution to the implementation of the project.&#13;
There will be an annual review as well as the mid-term and final project completion&#13;
reviews that will report on parental participation in the project.&#13;
C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.36  The project includes activities and processes aimed at strengthening national,&#13;
provincial and local monitoring and evaluation capacity. At the national level, SEdC&#13;
assisted the Association in the identification of an appropriate set of indicators, including&#13;
literacy and numeracy, which will help track achievement of educational goals. A CEP&#13;
comprising specialists in assessment, student financial aid, civil works, teacher education&#13;
and project evaluation, will be set up whose responsibilities will include project&#13;
supervision and providing advice on project implementation. The Panel will represent&#13;
the highest professional body in the project responsible for monitoring and evaluating the&#13;
professional and quality dimensions of project activities. At provincial, prefecture and&#13;
county levels, the project will include personnel training linked with the establishment or&#13;
upgrading of Educational Management Information Systems. The purpose of this&#13;
component is to build local capacity in data collection and analysis in order to monitor&#13;
and evaluate the progress of the project components as well as to support general&#13;
monitoring and evaluation capabilities in the provincial education systems. Provincial&#13;
education research institutes have already developed, in partnership with county&#13;
education bureaus and selected pilot schools, specific numeracy and literacy performance&#13;
indicators, satisfactory to the Association, that will be monitored under the project (see&#13;
Annex ).&#13;
3.37  Project Implementation Targets.  Project implementation targets for both&#13;
national and provincial level activities are contained in project implementation plans and&#13;
are based on existing, verified baseline data (see Annex 3 and 4). These targets are both&#13;
2&#13;
input targets (e.g., student: teacher ratios, numbers of teachers trained, m of dangerous&#13;
building eliminated, etc.) and output targets (e.g., lowered dropout rates in early primary&#13;
years, increased transition rates of girls to lower secondary school, increased number of&#13;
qualified teachers, literacy and numeracy rates, etc.). The provinces' capability to&#13;
annually collect and analyze data at the provincial and county levels will be enhanced by&#13;
the project-supported Educational Management Information Systems-including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
hardware procurement, software development and utilization training. (Such systems&#13;
have been put in place in 12 provinces by previous IDA-supported projects. Standards&#13;
developed during earlier IDA-supported projects and now accepted and set by the SEdC&#13;
are being used for the hardware, software and training.) Reports based on the data&#13;
collection and analysis will be available for the mid-term review, initial preparation of the&#13;
project completion report, and at the closing of the project. All targets are the result of&#13;
discussions between provincial and national education commissions and the Association&#13;
and are based on the development and early implementation experience of the EDPP and&#13;
BEII projects.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.38  The project cost is estimated at $191.8 million equivalent, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of $28.9 million equivalent, excluding taxes and duties. Project&#13;
costs are summarized by component in Table 3.1 and by category in Table 3.2. (See&#13;
Annex 11 for detailed tables.)&#13;
3.39  Unit Costs. Base costs are expressed in July 1995 prices. Civil works costs are&#13;
based on construction of similar schools in 14 pilot counties in 1994.  Costs of&#13;
equipment, books and materials are based on contracts for similar items awarded recently.&#13;
Technical assistance costs for internationally recruited experts include costs of salaries,&#13;
allowances and airfares, and are based on 1994 SEdC experience. Technical assistance&#13;
costs for local training are based on Spring 1995 actual costs provided by SEdC.&#13;
3.40  Contingency allowances have been estimated as follows. For local expenditures,&#13;
10.5 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999&#13;
and 2000, and 6.2 percent thereafter; and for foreign expenditures, 2.5 percent for 1996-&#13;
2001.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.41  IDA will finance $100 million equivalent, and the provinces, local municipalities&#13;
and counties $91.8 million. The credit will cover all the foreign exchange requirements&#13;
and about 45 percent of local costs. The project's financing plan is given in Table 3.3.&#13;
The proposed credit will be made available to the project provinces at an annual interest&#13;
rate of 1.2 percent or less. The provincial governrments' debt service obligation for the&#13;
total credit will be negligible. For instance, based on actual provincial revenues, the debt&#13;
service obligation for the total credit would be only 0.26 percent of 1994 provincial&#13;
revenues. At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Borrower that it will make&#13;
a part of the proceeds of the Credit available to participating provincial governments for&#13;
their Education Programs on the following terms: repayment over 20 years (with 5 years&#13;
grace), interest at 1.2 percent per year. The provincial governments will bear the foreign&#13;
exchange risks on those proceeds. Each participating province will allocate the Credit&#13;
proceeds to its counties, as far as possible on a grant basis, otherwise on terms at least&#13;
as favorable as those terms on which the province receives the funds from the central&#13;
government.&#13;

F. SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY&#13;
3.42   The project will partially finance school-based activities at the village, township,&#13;
county and provincial level, activities which are embedded within and support the key&#13;
national education policy of achieving universal 9-year education by the year 2000. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
moderate level of IDA financing for the project (approximately 52 percent) and the&#13;
annual levels of counterpart funding necessary for the project as a ratio of the actual 1995&#13;
provincial and county education budgets (0.89 and 3.3 percent, respectively, on average)&#13;
increase both the chances for sustainability and affordability of the project activities.&#13;
Even during 1997, when the highest annual disbursements can be expected (i.e.,&#13;
35 percent of total disbursements), average county level counterpart funding will only be&#13;
4.7 percent of the projected 1997 education budgets. Additionally, the source of&#13;
provincial counterpart funding is balanced and sustainable-on average approximately 57&#13;
percent from the county and 43 percent from the province and prefecture level. Likewise,&#13;
the poverty reduction focus of the project is central to the Government's 7-year plan to&#13;
eliminate absolute poverty by the year 2000, a plan that specifically aims at upgrading&#13;
education and literacy in backward and poor areas. Built into the project are maintenance&#13;
costs for schools, classrooms and equipment procured under the project, equipment&#13;
procurement, technical assistance and training to develop a planning-enhancing MIS&#13;
system. One component of the project, the dissemination program, specifically supports&#13;
piloting results of policy-focused research and experiments in areas of increased&#13;
efficiency in school administration. The training of approximately 138,000 teachers and&#13;
school managers builds and strengthens existing and new human resource capacity which&#13;
will remain in place long after the end of the project. (See Annex 12 for detailed data.)&#13;
3.43   The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected&#13;
total recurrent costs of compulsory education in project counties in 2001 with the&#13;
projected recurrent budgets for compulsory education in these counties in that year. Total&#13;
recurrent cost in 2001 is the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and&#13;
nonpersonnel inputs in 2001 and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the project.&#13;
The total annual recurrent costs implication of the project is equal to the sum of the&#13;
annual costs needed to maintain the effectiveness of project investments in school&#13;
buildings, equipment, furniture, and technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual&#13;
costs of maintenance of an education input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient&#13;
for that input and the project investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across&#13;
education inputs and across project counties. It is between 2 and 3 percent for school&#13;
buildings, between 3 and 4 percent for equipment, between 1 and 2 percent for furniture,&#13;
and between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected recurrent budgets&#13;
in 2001 were estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in 1994 and a&#13;
historical growth rate.&#13;
3.44  During appraisal, the analysis showed that the project was not sustainable in two&#13;
of the seven provinces. The development targets and project size for the counties in these&#13;
two provinces were therefore reduced. Though the project appeared to be sustainable for&#13;
the counties in a third province, the recurrent budget in 2001 was based on a somewhat&#13;
optimistic growth rate; the development targets and project size were also reduced for this&#13;
province. The project was found to be sustainable for the counties in the other four&#13;
provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
3.45   The final results of the analysis are incorporated in the revised feasibility reports&#13;
prepared by the provincial representatives. The total annual recurrent cost implications of&#13;
the project investment have been found to be a small percentage (projected 0.5 percent) of&#13;
the projected 2001 total recurrent costs at the provincial level. The aggregate results for&#13;
the project counties are given in Annex 13. The mission expects the project-related&#13;
recurrent costs to be borne by the project counties to be manageable.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.1   National Level Implementation. SEdC, through the Central Component, will&#13;
implement national level project activities in which each province has a shared&#13;
involvement (see para. 3.26). These activities will include: national level training,&#13;
foreign study tours and overseas study, project reporting, the research and dissemination&#13;
program and project studies. All national level activities will be implemented by the&#13;
Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO) and other appropriate SEdC technical&#13;
departments, using technical and administrative resources which are familiar to the&#13;
Association and have proved satisfactory in the past. FILO, in order to fulfill the national&#13;
development goals of the project, will monitor and supervise the project's&#13;
implementation goals and make necessary supplementary changes in management of the&#13;
project when necessary. FILO was formed in 1981 to implement the first University&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 2021-CHA and Cr. 1167-CHA) and has extensive experience&#13;
in the technical aspects of project execution. The aspects of implementation devolved to&#13;
provincial educational bureaus will include development of the education management&#13;
information system (EMIS) at that level, with coordination of FILO and the Educational&#13;
Management Information Center (EMIC) of SEdC.&#13;
4.2   The SEdC's responsibilities in project implementation would be increased under&#13;
this project, in view of its growing capabilities and experience with IDA-financed&#13;
operations. Specifically, SEdC will assume responsibility for:&#13;
(a)   carrying out of national level training activities (including a limited&#13;
number of study tours and overseas training programs) in accordance with&#13;
an action plan acceptable to the Association;&#13;
(b)   coordination and oversight of project implementation carried out at the&#13;
national, provincial, prefectural and county levels;&#13;
(c)   review of goods and works procurement procedures to make sure they are&#13;
being carried out in accordance with the Development Credit Agreement&#13;
(DCA);&#13;
(d)   carrying out of periodic supervision, together with the Provincial&#13;
authorities, of action plan implementation at the provincial, prefectural and&#13;
county levels. This would entail review meetings at the provincial level&#13;
and sample visits to counties.  One review meeting will include&#13;
Association staff participation; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37 -&#13;
(e)   preparation of a mid-term review report by October 31, 1998 and project&#13;
completion report in a format agreeable to the Association.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that a national level Project Implementation&#13;
Office (FIL0), reporting to a Vice Chairman of SEdC, will be maintained throughout the&#13;
duration of the project, with terms of reference, members and resources acceptable to the&#13;
Association, and that SEdC will carry out its activities under the Central Component in&#13;
accordance with a time-bound action plan. A first-year national action plan, including&#13;
this Central Component, containing time-bound implementation and financial plans&#13;
acceptable to the Association, was furnished at negotiations and would be updated&#13;
annually.&#13;
4.3   Each participating province was closely involved in project preparation,&#13;
producing action and financing plans to be implemented during the project period,&#13;
accompanied by indicators to monitor progress in implementing these action plans.&#13;
These plans with impact indicators are contained in the Project Implementation Plans&#13;
(PIPs), which have been produced at both the national and provincial levels and are&#13;
available in the project files.&#13;
4.4   Provincial Level Implementation. Since the bulk of project activities will take&#13;
place in the provinces, the main implementation responsibilities will be assumed at that&#13;
level, with SEdC providing overall guidance and coordination of certain national program&#13;
TA activities, prescreening procurement procedures and arranging for joint procurement&#13;
where appropriate. At the provincial level, Foreign Investment and Loan Offices (FILOs)&#13;
have been formed, headed by the Vice Commissioners of the respective Provincial&#13;
Education Commissions (PECs), and staffed with officials familiar with education&#13;
planning and management, financial management and accounting, civil works and&#13;
equipment. A similar structure has been repeated at the county level. The provincial&#13;
FILOs will be responsible for overseeing the activities of the county FILOs and arranging&#13;
for the necessary training. This model has worked in the implementation of the EDPP&#13;
and BEII projects. Provincial and county level project implementation units, headed by a&#13;
Vice Commissioner of the Provincial Education Commission, have been established.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these implementation units would be&#13;
maintained throughout project implementation.&#13;
4.5   Modalities of implementation at the provincial level are detailed in the PIPs,&#13;
which are based on Education Programs. Education Programs are those activities that&#13;
have been reviewed, appraised and found acceptable by IDA as project-supported&#13;
activities. Provincial Education Program Implementation Arrangements will be ratified&#13;
by the Borrower and the participating provinces, outlining the implementing&#13;
arrangements for carrying out the province's Education Programs (see Anneax14). At&#13;
negotiations, provinces submitted the first year annual action plans (containing both time-&#13;
bound implementation and financial plans and monitorable indicators) acceptable to the&#13;
Association. As a condition of effectiveness the Borrower will provide the Association&#13;
with Provincial Education Program Implementation Arrangements, acceptable to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Association, ratified by the Borrower and participating provinces for carrying out the&#13;
provinces' Education Programs. During negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
provinces and IDA would review annual provincial action plans by October 15 each&#13;
year, and thereafter carry out the plans as agreed by the Borrower and IDA. The&#13;
proposed action plans will include the next year 's civil works plan, annual maintenance&#13;
plan and a program to ensure participation of parents in the implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.6   The Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) has been organized by SEdC to assist in the&#13;
implementation of the project at both the national and provincial levels. The Panel is&#13;
composed of representatives from the Government, educational research units, and&#13;
Chinese universities. It will report to SEdC's FILO. The Panel will: (a) advise provinces&#13;
and counties on the development and implementation of educational plans; (b) advise on&#13;
the development and implementation of staff training activities; (c) periodically monitor&#13;
implementation progress by reviewing project indicators; (d) monitor the educational&#13;
achievement targets for the project provinces' nonproject supported counties at mid-term&#13;
and project completion; (e) monitor and report on the effectiveness of the student&#13;
assistance program; and (f) coordinate the implementation of the dissemination program.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.7   Civil Works ($120.7 million). This includes new construction as well as major&#13;
and minor repairs of school buildings. Most of the schools are in small villages or&#13;
dispersed rural areas and therefore it is unlikely that foreign contractors will be interested&#13;
in bidding. New construction and major repairs costing $40,000 or more each will be&#13;
awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) under procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Association. Minor repairs and works expected to cost less than $40,000, up to an&#13;
aggregate of $28.0 million, may be carried out through force account. Construction&#13;
supervision will be coordinated by County Construction Bureaus and supervised by the&#13;
Provincial Construction Bureaus.  Standard bid documents prepared in China, in&#13;
consultation with IDA, will be used for NCB. Annual provincial civil works plans will&#13;
be reviewed and approved each year by IDA. The $28.0 million of works that will be&#13;
carried out under force account has been allocated by the Borrower as indicated in Annex&#13;
15.&#13;
4.8   Experience derived from early implementation of the EDPP project indicates that&#13;
force account has been used in situations where NCB would have been preferable. This&#13;
highlights the necessity for more training of the local county and provincial level&#13;
implementation staffs so that this problem will be less likely to reoccur. Accordingly,&#13;
more attention will be paid to civil works procurement during project launch seminars.&#13;
4.9   Goods ($49.4 million). Experience with the implementation of earlier Bank&#13;
Group-supported basic education projects indicates that it is highly unlikely that&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be needed for procurement of goods&#13;
(classroom furniture and teaching equipment) for the project. However, should there be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
equipment and materials procurement under contracts of $200,000 or above, they will be&#13;
awarded through ICB. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped&#13;
into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more each. Standard&#13;
bidding documents issued by the Association would be used for ICB and local&#13;
manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in bid evaluation of 15&#13;
percent or the prevailing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts estimated to&#13;
cost under $200,000 for primary and secondary school equipment, furniture, tent schools&#13;
and materials up to an aggregate amount not expected to exceed $20 million, and all book&#13;
contracts, will be awarded through NCB procedures acceptable to the Association. NCB&#13;
will be used for procurement of books (aggregate value of $10.2 million) following&#13;
procedures developed in the two earlier basic education projects. Books are selected by&#13;
schools, county and provincial education authorities from a list prepared by SEdC and&#13;
published by competing provincial book companies. Past experience and review of book&#13;
procurement contracts indicates that competition, based on price, has been the main factor&#13;
in the awarding of provincial contracts for books. Equipment and materials contracts&#13;
with an estimated value of less than $30,000 and an aggregate amount equivalent to $5.7&#13;
million for the project will be awarded under shopping procedures (in accordance with&#13;
provisions 3.5 and 3.6 of the "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995) after solicitation and evaluation of at&#13;
least three written price quotations from eligible suppliers.&#13;
4.10  Consultant Services and Training ($21.7 million). Teacher training will be&#13;
contracted by County Education Bureaus with Teacher Training Institutions. Studies&#13;
(i.e., dissemination program and student assistance program), and domestic and&#13;
intemational consultants will be selected by the provinces with the assistance of the CEP&#13;
and FILO using the Bank Group's standard form of contract for consultants' services, and&#13;
following guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers dated August&#13;
1981. The aggregate amount for training activities is $15.9 million and consultant&#13;
services is $5.8 million. Details on staff-months and costs are in Annex 8.&#13;
4.11  Review of Project Procurement Procedures. Prior review by the Association of&#13;
all stages of the bidding process will be required for: (a) all contracts for consulting firms&#13;
valued at $100,000 or more and for individual contracts valued at $50,000 or more;&#13;
(b) the first two proposed NCB works contracts from each province annually throughout&#13;
the project. The rest would be subject to random sample survey post review by IDA&#13;
supervision missions; and (c) all goods and works contracts valued at or above $300,000.&#13;
NCB procurement for equipment is expected to take place through one major exercise in&#13;
each province with an appropriate number of packages for schools and equipment kits&#13;
level. Two equipment contracts per province will be subject to prior review. The PECs&#13;
will compile all equipment and book lists based on SEdC approved equipment lists.&#13;
These lists will be reviewed and approved by the FILO Equipment Division. With regard&#13;
to the proposed works contracts for which Bank prior review is required, SEdC will&#13;
review them to ensure compliance with the Bank Group's requirements. The Resident&#13;
Mission in China will prescreen these documents prior to forwarding the contracts to&#13;
headquarters for its review. Prior review coverage will be of approximately 11 to 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
percent of goods contracts and 4 to 6 percent of works contracts. The provisions of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Association review or approval of budgets, short&#13;
lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts&#13;
do not apply to (a) contracts for the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less&#13;
than $100,000 equivalent each or (b) contracts for the employment of individuals&#13;
estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each. However, the exceptions to prior&#13;
Association review do not apply to (a) the terms of reference for contracts, (b) single-&#13;
source selection of consulting firms, (c) assignments of critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by the Association, (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of&#13;
consulting firms raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above, or (e)&#13;
amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising the&#13;
contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.&#13;

4.12  The proposed IDA Credit for $100.0 million equivalent will be disbursed over a&#13;
period of 5 years as shown in Table 4.2 and Annex 16. The percentages of disbursement&#13;
for each expenditure category under the Credit are given in Table 4.3, and follow a&#13;
disbursement profile derived from earlier Bank Group experience in basic education and&#13;
teacher training projects, especially ones which contain a substantial amount of civil&#13;
works. Reimbursements will be based on contracts except for: (a) training programs;&#13;

first two works contracts per province per year; and (c) contracts for consulting firms&#13;
valued at $100,000 equivalent or less and for individual consultants' contracts valued at&#13;

Expenditures (SOEs). This SOE threshold has been established based on the good prior&#13;
experience with the implementing agency in the earlier EDPP and BEII projects and the&#13;
nature of the project. The provincial project units will be responsible for preparing&#13;
withdrawal applications. County project units will prepare withdrawal applications for&#13;
submission to the Provincial Project Unit. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will review&#13;
the applications and submit them to the Association. Documents supporting the SOEs&#13;
will be retained by the MOF and made available for information to SEdC and inspection&#13;
by IDA supervision missions. Retroactive financing of up to 10 percent of the credit&#13;
amount ($10 million equivalent) is recommended to cover payments already made under&#13;
the project starting from December 1, 1995 for training activities and February 15, 1996&#13;
for civil works contracts.&#13;

4.13 A Special Account in United States dollars, managed by MOF, with an&#13;
authorized allocation of $7.2 million, based on 4 months average disbursements, would&#13;
be established in a bank, and on terms and conditions, satisfactory to the Association. It&#13;
will be replenished monthly or whenever it is drawn down to half its initial deposit level,&#13;
whichever occurs first. Disbursements for staff training in China or study tours abroad&#13;
will be made from the Special Account against the actual cost of travel, subsistence and&#13;
training fees incurred.&#13;
4.14  Accounts and Audits. Provincial and national project accounts and details of the&#13;
Special Account will be maintained by MOF. Annual audits will be performed by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Association, and a consolidated audit report sent to&#13;
the Association. At negotiations, agreement was reached that a consolidated annual&#13;
audit report of national and provincial project accounts and Special Accounts would be&#13;
submitted to the Association within eight months of the end of each Government fiscal&#13;
year, and that the audit will contain a separate opinion regarding the SOEs.&#13;
D. REPORTING&#13;
4.15  A project implementation timetable is shown in Annex 17. The project is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and will be implemented over a five-year&#13;
period, plus six months for the completion of payments and full withdrawal of credit&#13;
proceeds. The credit is thus expected to close by December 31, 2001 (as in Annex 16).&#13;
4.16 During project implementation, periodic missions from the Association will&#13;
review the progress of project implementation including parental participation (see para.&#13;
3.30), according to a Supervision Plan and based on indicators presented in Annexes 18&#13;
and-7, respectively. SEdC/FILO, with the assistance of the Chinese Experts Panel, will&#13;
monitor progress on a province by province basis using indicators included in the agreed&#13;
PIP for each province. During negotiations, agreement was reached that a mid-term&#13;
report will be prepared before October 31, 1998 [see para 4.2 (e)j.&#13;
4.17  Each year, IDA and the SEdC will jointly review the progress toward completion&#13;
of the annual action plans and approve the following year's annual action plan. Annual&#13;
reports on the progress of project implementation will be prepared by FILO, beginning&#13;
April 1, 1997, based on information received from the PIP review meetings, operational&#13;
units and agencies of the project. These reports will give special attention to the&#13;
development of the EMIS, teacher training activities, and the dissemination program. A&#13;
project completion report will be prepared by FILO and submitted to the Association&#13;
within six months of the closing of the project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
that using data provided by PECs by March 1, SEdC will monitor and evaluate project&#13;
progress on the basis of indicators acceptable to the Association, and furnish the&#13;
Association the results of such reviews by April 1 of each year.&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The project is expected to benefit about 8.3 million of the poorest school children&#13;
in some of the more economically disadvantaged counties of some of China's poorer&#13;
provinces. It will significantly expand basic education among the poor, especially in the&#13;
remote areas inhabited by minority nationalities. Provision of education to remote and&#13;
rural areas not only helps to create opportunities for rural development but also provides&#13;
the skills necessary to participate in economic growth in township and urban centers.&#13;
Minority nationality students will be better prepared to participate in Chinese schools in&#13;
the upper and post-secondary levels. Other aspects of the project specifically focus on&#13;
delivery of educational inputs for poor girls with fee remission and free textbooks&#13;
provided under the student assistance subcomponent, as well as targeted training of&#13;
female principals and gender sensitive teacher training programs. Furthermore, the&#13;
project includes specific interventions designed to improve planning and management&#13;
capacity of the central, provincial and county governments to prepare and implement&#13;
similar comprehensive projects and to replicate them in other parts of the country. The&#13;
project will have a direct impact on between a third and all (depending on the county) of&#13;
the schools and children in 124 counties (covering approximately 46,000 schools) and&#13;
will provide varying lengths of training for approximately 138,000 teachers and education&#13;
managers.&#13;
B. PROJECT FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.2   Total project costs are estimated at $191.8 million equivalent of which IDA would&#13;
finance $100 million. The total base costs are $148.4 million. Bank contingencies are&#13;
applied to local expenditures, civil works and foreign expenditures. At negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that each participating province would provide adequate&#13;
counterpart funding for financing its respective Education Program included in the&#13;
project.&#13;
5.3   Detailed Analysis. Five areas of economic and financial analysis pertaining to&#13;
the project have been undertaken:  (a) an analysis of the financial feasibility of&#13;
development targets for compulsory education in the project counties during 1996-2000;&#13;
(b) an analysis of the financial feasibility of development targets for compulsory&#13;
education in project provinces during 1996-2000; (c) an analysis of the sustainability of&#13;
the project in the project counties after its completion in 2001; (d) an assessment of the&#13;
availability of counterpart funding; and (e) an examination of the financing and operative&#13;
guidelines of a student-assistance program (see Annex12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5.4   School construction and teacher training programs have been examined on the&#13;
basis of a thorough analysis of both availability of counterpart funding during the&#13;
implementation phase of the project and recurrent funding thereafter. These analyses&#13;
were performed for each participating province and each county and necessary&#13;
adjustments were made in the project targets (primarily in a slight reduction in the scale&#13;
of civil work) and in the rate of IDA disbursements (spread over a slightly longer period&#13;
of time).&#13;
5.5   Sustainability analysis using current feasibility report financial data showed that&#13;
the effectiveness of the project investment could not be maintained after project&#13;
completion in most of the counties in three of the seven provinces using development&#13;
targets presented by the provinces. There was a clear need to adjust development targets&#13;
for these project counties and to reduce the size of the project in these provinces. This&#13;
finding was reinforced by the analysis on counterpart funding. In an effort to reduce the&#13;
burden of counterpart funding on project counties, four of the seven provinces have&#13;
increased the share of provincial contribution for counterpart funding to at least 40&#13;
percent. However, the burden of counterpart funding still remained relatively high for&#13;
counties in the other three provinces; and the ratio of counterpart funding to IDA&#13;
investment was over 1:1 for two of these provinces.&#13;
5.6    Based on the findings of the analyses of feasibility, sustainability, and counterpart&#13;
funding, provinces decided not to reduce their contribution to the counterpart funding&#13;
which will mean that the ratio of provincially provided counterpart funds will rise in&#13;
relationship to the county proportion, thus taking some of the financial pressure off the&#13;
counties. The ratio of counterpart funding to IDA investment based on the feasibility&#13;
studies reviewed and modified during the appraisal mission is projected to be 0.88 for&#13;
Anhui, 1.08 for Fujian, 0.84 for Gansu, 0.95 for Hebei, 0.98 for Henan, 1.08 for Jilin, and&#13;
0.5 for Qinghai. The aggregate ratio for the project is 1:0.89. The reduction in the&#13;
proposed counterpart funding required adjustment in development targets, changes in the&#13;
size of project components, and changes in the distribution of project funds across&#13;
components, all of which were finalized at appraisal.&#13;
5.7    A student assistance program will be included as a subcomponent in this project.&#13;
Results of a household survey on household education spending (HES) conducted as part&#13;
of project preparation indicate that in the four national poverty counties covered by the&#13;
study, HES averages were between 9 to 11 percent of total spending of a household and&#13;
between 14 to 31 percent of the net income of a household. (An alternative estimate&#13;
indicates that the proportion can be as high as 83 percent.) HES is a heavy economic&#13;
burden for a significant proportion of households in the four counties, especially when&#13;
economic burden is measured as a ratio of HES to household income. A sizable number&#13;
of households have to borrow money or receive subsidies from relatives and friends in&#13;
order to support the household costs of schooling.&#13;
5.8   Through piloting the student assistance program in the project counties, provincial&#13;
authorities will develop financing and operating guidelines for this program. Preliminary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45 -&#13;
analysis of this subcomponent indicated that it could provide assistance to a significant&#13;
proportion of poor primary students in several of the provinces. Program development&#13;
guidelines would: (a) give higher priority to primary students; (b) give higher priority to&#13;
female and minority students, especially in counties where female and minority&#13;
participation in compulsory education was relatively low; (c) consider the use of the&#13;
central compulsory education special fund to finance a trust fund for student assistance;&#13;
and (d) develop a student-assistance plan for the year 2000 indicating financial needs,&#13;
coverage, and financing sources.&#13;
5.9   In summary, the analysis has: (a) resulted in the revisions of provincial proposals&#13;
to ensure that the project is financially feasible during the project years and that project&#13;
effectiveness is sustainable after project completion; (b) ensured additional and better&#13;
targeted national and provincial level "categorical" funding for student assistance&#13;
programs; (c) clarified and adjusted the amount of counterpart funding and thus reduced&#13;
the risk of a shortage in counterpart funding during project implementation; (d) modified&#13;
project design so that project components and investment are more closely tied to project&#13;
goals; (e) raised the awareness of Chinese counterparts about the importance and&#13;
usefulness of economic and financial analysis in project design and appraisal; and (f) laid&#13;
the foundation for a sound economic and financial analysis for the projected fourth basic&#13;
education project in China.&#13;
5.10   Risks. There are three main risks in this project. First, the provinces may not&#13;
ensure that the population in other poor counties (not covered in the project) would&#13;
benefit from improved access to and quality of basic education. To deal with this, the&#13;
project provinces will be required to implement acceptable action plans with monitorable&#13;
indicators to ensure that education achievements in nonproject poor counties will not&#13;
deteriorate during the implementation. Second, the central, provincial and county&#13;
officials may be unable to oversee the implementation of the project activities. Cognizant&#13;
of this risk, management strengthening at all three levels is a principal activity of the&#13;
project. Additionally, lessons learned from implementing the IDA-supported EDPP and&#13;
Basic Education II projects will be included in the training of provincial and county level&#13;
implementation units for this project. Finally, there may be inadequate commitment on&#13;
the part of SEdC, project provinces and counties, which may result in insufficient&#13;
counterpart funding to match IDA credits. However, SEdC has indicated that it is willing&#13;
to allocate sufficient amounts of its own annual budgetary allocation for poor counties to&#13;
the seven project provinces to assure adequate counterpart funding (see Annex 19 and&#13;
2Q). Additionally, implementation experience of the two earlier basic education projects&#13;
and the strong provincial and county level work necessary to develop the current project&#13;
indicate that the risk is not excessive.&#13;

ANNEX 1: SOCIAL SECTOR EXPENDITURE REVIEW-&#13;
EDUCATION SECTION&#13;
April 1995&#13;
Overall Development&#13;
1.    For more than three decades, educational development in China has been quite&#13;
impressive. The adult literacy rate, an outcome of past cumulative investment in&#13;
education, grew from 60 percent in 1960 to 74 percent in 1992. By the early 1960s,&#13;
China had also achieved virtually universal enrollment in primary education, a coverage&#13;
rate that still outpaces the rates found in several Asian counterparts. But, China does lag&#13;
behind other countries regarding other dimensions of educational progress. For instance,&#13;
its rate of enrollment in secondary and particularly in higher education is below both the&#13;
average among all Asian countries and the rates found in low-income countries, let alone&#13;
its close comparators. Yet, when income level is accounted for, the level of educational&#13;
attainment in China is moderately high relative to other countries. Qualitative indicators&#13;
for China, such as average grade attainment of the current school-age population and&#13;
cohort survival rate, although showing steady progress, are modest when compared with&#13;
those of Malaysia, Korea, and Sri Lanka.&#13;
2.    Thus, there may be little scope for improving quantity, but there is room for&#13;
quality enhancement in schooling, which may in fact generate more significant gains in&#13;
educational attainment. Evidence from several developing countries suggests that the rate&#13;
of return to improving the quality of schooling is high compared to improving quantity of&#13;
schooling of a given quality'.&#13;
Education Cost and Financing&#13;
3.    Trends, Structure and Composition.  At least three important features&#13;
characterize the composition of public educational expenditure over the past decade&#13;
(Table 1.3)2. First, recurrent expenditures have increased in real terms; the bulk going&#13;
towards such "autonomous" categories as teachers' salaries and gradually meager&#13;

Schooling: Quantity Alone is Misleading," American Economic Review, 1983. Jere Behrman, Donald&#13;

to improve retention rates among teachers in various provinces.&#13;

4.     Of total, expenditures on nonpersonnel instructional materials fell from 30 percent&#13;
in 1990 to 23 percent in 1993. By devoting its expenditures largely to teachers' salaries&#13;
in order to retain a pool of skilled personnel, the government has been forced to find&#13;
alternative mechanisms for financing educational supplies and materials. As such it&#13;
allows all primary and secondary schools to charge fees and universities to charge tuition&#13;
and fees, and to engage in revenue-generating activities. Increasingly, revenues from&#13;
students' fee, tuition in post-basic education, and contributions from collectives are used&#13;
to finance purchase of books, supplies and teaching aids. This user-fee policy in&#13;
education is designed to simultaneously minimize the crowding-out effect and maximize&#13;
the equity in the allocation of government education spending. The additional resources&#13;
mobilized from private spending thus helping the government to provide greater coverage&#13;
at all levels of education.&#13;
5.     Second, real capital expenditures have been volatile and even fell on average&#13;
between 1985 and 1991. However, the percentage of cuts in capital expenditures on&#13;
education were smaller than the average cuts in capital expenditures overall for the public&#13;
sector. This pattern conforms to the general finding that spending on education tends not&#13;

6.    And, third, the share of educational expenditure in GNP and government&#13;
expenditure is low compared with neighboring Asian countries that have a similar income&#13;
per capita and economic structure. Between 1983 and 1993, China has committed an&#13;
average of about 2 percent of GNP on education, representing on average 10.1 percent of&#13;
total public expenditure.4 But these shares are relatively low compared to Asian&#13;
neighbors that have a similar income per capita and economic structure.&#13;
7.    The distribution of public spending by level of education is 36 percent on primary&#13;
education, followed by 34 percent in secondary education and the balance in higher&#13;
education. This distribution of public spending on education is thus equitable, which is&#13;
noteworthy when compared with the patterns observed in many neighboring Asian&#13;
countries, where higher education receives the bulk of subsidies. Again, the unit cost of&#13;
public education in China-measured as per-pupil expenditure as a percentage of GNP&#13;
per capita-is low. In primary education, this is close to unit cost in Nepal, but&#13;
substantially lower than in Malaysia, Korea and Thailand. The unit cost in secondary&#13;
education in China is lower than those in Bangladesh and Papua New Guinea. Similarly&#13;
unit cost in higher education is lower than these two countries. The relatively low unit&#13;
cost in primary education is due to high pupil-teacher ratios and the low capital costs of&#13;
education. The high unit cost in tertiary education in China, when compared with those,&#13;
say, in the Philippines and Thailand, is attributable to very low enrollments and higher&#13;
expenditures on training and research in public institutions, whereas a significant&#13;
proportion of spending on higher education is borne by the private sector and open&#13;
universities in the Philippines and Thailand, respectively.&#13;
8.    Sources of Financing Educational Expenditures. The government has a long-&#13;
standing policy of using local revenue and community resources to finance primary and&#13;
secondary education so as to free-up more central government funds for other purposes&#13;
particularly for higher education and research. The bulk of the central government&#13;
appropriations go to university programs run by the State Education Committee and to&#13;
other specialized schools. Of total spending on primary and secondary education, more&#13;
than 75 percent comes from government budgets and education levies, the balance is&#13;
accounted for by private sources-local contributions from parents communities, tuition&#13;
and fees, school enterprises, and various school-raised funds.  Educational levies&#13;
comprise 1 percent of value added taxes in urban municipalities and 3 percent of sales&#13;
3 Contrary to conventional wisdom, here, and studies elsewhere by Pinstrup-Anderson (1990), Jarmitto&#13;
and Steward (1989) suggest that on average social sector expenditures were the most sheltered of other&#13;
important sectors I counties pursuing economic reforms.&#13;
4 This would be larger if the noneducation sectors educational spending is included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                     ANNEX I&#13;
from production elsewhere. The funds raised from these levies are also used to finance&#13;
teacher salaries and school building construction, but they are not included in the&#13;
government budget. School-raised funds comprise tax-exempt revenues from school&#13;
factories; these revenues are normally used to improve the living conditions of teachers.&#13;
9.    Historically, the government subsidy in Chinese higher education has limited&#13;
private spending that students want to make. One indication of private willingness to pay&#13;
is the existence of excess demand for higher education, i.e., more applicants than&#13;
available places. Imposing selective tuition and fees would not reduce the demand for&#13;
education but would instead allow government to mobilize private contributions for&#13;
expanding access and thus improving equity. Recently the Chinese government has&#13;
adopted a reform policy which call for reduced subsidies and higher cost recovery in&#13;
higher education.&#13;

ANNEX 2: PROPOSED BASIC EDUCATION III PROJECT&#13;
QUESTIONNAIRE CONCERNING REVIEW OF OED AUDITS&#13;
INVESTMENT PROJECTS&#13;
1.    How many OED audit reports have been done on projects in the same&#13;
subsector as the proposed project for: (a) the same country O; (b) the same region 4;&#13;
and (c) for all countries worldwide 14.&#13;
2.    What are the main technical design lessons learned from these audit reports?&#13;
From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in China, the lessons&#13;
learned are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Project design should not be overly complex or overly optimistic in its&#13;
expectations. Greater awareness of the difficulties of expanding and&#13;
improving education in impoverished areas should take this into&#13;
consideration in project design.&#13;
(b)   An effective monitoring and evaluation systems should be established&#13;
prior to project implementation to assess project development impact.&#13;
(c)   Early involvement and participation of stakeholders especially at the&#13;
county level, helps to ensure smooth implementation, accountability and&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
(d)   In projects with larger proportions of civil works in dispersed&#13;
impoverished rural areas there is a need to include an architect on the&#13;
Bank project assistance team.&#13;
3.    What are the main policy and institutional design lessons learned from these&#13;
audit reports? From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in&#13;
China, the lessons learned are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Follow-up projects pursuing similar objectives to those of previous&#13;
projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate earlier&#13;
achievements, which might otherwise falter and fade away. Thus, follow-&#13;
up projects should be part of a long-term investment program with clearly&#13;
defined objectives based on sound sector work.&#13;
(b)   Importance of ownership on the part of the implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                     ANNEX2&#13;
(c)   Importance of sustained commitment on the part of the borrower to&#13;
provide the necessary resources to support basic education.&#13;
(d)   The project should be flexible enough to accommodate mid-course&#13;
corrections in scope, content, and approach. Experts panels should be&#13;
established to review implementation address issues relevant to mid-&#13;
course corrections.&#13;
(e)   Increasing access for girls, minority and poor children to quality primary&#13;
education must be addressed by innovative enrollment policies and student&#13;
assistance programs.&#13;
4.    How has the proposed project design benefited, if at all, from the above&#13;
review of lessons learned?&#13;
(a)   The project began with a joint Bank/Borrower training course on project&#13;
design, which included individuals from the preparation and implementing&#13;
agencies. The utilization of monitorable indicators was a component of&#13;
the project training course. (2a, 2b)&#13;
(b)   The borrower and provincial education authorities have been responsible&#13;
for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the provincial and&#13;
county levels to develop proposals which include local level identification&#13;
of issues and optimal solutions. Because this is a repeater project, this&#13;
process was facilitated by using experiences and models from earlier&#13;
projects. (2c, 3a, 3b)&#13;
(c)   A Chinese experts panel has been used to assist in the design of project&#13;
components and will be used during project implementation to provide&#13;
ongoing high level professional monitoring of project implementation.&#13;
(2b, 3a, 3d)&#13;
(d)   A county financing study and household survey has been initiated to better&#13;
understand what the necessary commitment is for sustaining appropriate&#13;
levels of support for basic education. (3c)&#13;
(e)   The innovation component aims at supporting action oriented research&#13;
programs that will identify innovative approaches to improving access for&#13;
girls, minorities and poor children. (3e)&#13;

ANNEX 9: DISSEMINATION PROJECTS COMPONENT-&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES&#13;
Project Description&#13;
1.    The aim of this component is to disseminate and use the results of previous&#13;
successful experiments, pilots and research activities to overcome existing educational&#13;
problems at the primary and lower secondary levels in project-supported counties.&#13;
Previous successful results can come from activities supported by both Chinese and&#13;
international organizations (i.e., Provincial governments and research institutes,&#13;
universities, the State Education Commission (SEdC), World Bank, UNICEF,&#13;
UNESCO). The successful results can come from both within and outside of China.&#13;
2.    This component will be carried out in each province based on approved&#13;
dissemination project plans, implementation schedules, budgets, completion targets and&#13;
monitoring indicators and reporting procedures. The dissemination projects will be&#13;
supervised by the Provincial Education Bureaus (PEBs), and monitored by SEdC and the&#13;
World Bank. The Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) will provide advice on the provincial&#13;
dissemination projects, monitor their progress and report on their implementation to both&#13;
SEdC and the World Bank.&#13;
3.    The topics and proposed budgets for the dissemination projects have been&#13;
approved and accepted in principle but the draft dissemination project plan must be&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Bank before project funds can be disbursed for this&#13;
component.&#13;
4.    The next step will be the preparation of draft dissemination project plans for&#13;
review and approval. These plans will include identifying:&#13;
(a)   specific educational problems to be solved in project counties;&#13;
(b)   successful results of previous successful experiments to be drawn from&#13;
evaluation reports of pilots and research activities to provide the&#13;
foundation of practices for dissemination;&#13;
(c)   project goals and linked completion targets;&#13;
(d)   project coverage and locations of dissemination activities;&#13;
(e)   project schedule with monitorable milestones;&#13;
(f)   project budget by specific activity and year; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67 -                     ANNEX9&#13;
(g)   project progress indicators including starting baseline data, project mid-&#13;
term and completion targets.&#13;
5.    The proposed dissemination project plans should be prepared by the Provincial&#13;
Education Bureaus and sent to the Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) for their review and&#13;
comment. The CEP recommendations should be sent to the World Bank for its review&#13;
and approval. If the CEP has not been fully organized in time for this review, the SEdC&#13;
Department of Finance will designate a group which can carry out the review.&#13;
(a)   The draft dissemination project plans were submitted to the Finance&#13;
Department of the State Education Commission (SEdC) by December 31,&#13;
1995.&#13;
(b)   The draft plan was reviewed by the CEP before submission to the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
6.    Annual reports, with action plans and budgets for the following year, will be&#13;
prepared and submitted to the Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) and the World Bank for their&#13;
review and approval. The mid-term results of the dissemination projects will be reviewed&#13;
by the CEP, SEdC and the Bank during the overall project mid-term review, and any&#13;
necessary modifications in the dissemination plan will be made at that time.&#13;
7.    Project implementation plans may include a minor amount of dissemination&#13;
related equipment up to a maximum of 40 percent of the dissemination plan budget. This&#13;
will not include research equipment. The requests for any equipment will be included in&#13;
the dissemination plans and reviewed and approved by the CEP and the World Bank.&#13;
8.    At mid-term and project completion, dissemination seminars will be organized by&#13;
the CEP and SEdC to study best practices and results of the projects.&#13;

ANNEX 12: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    As part of the preparation of the Third Basic Education Projection, economic&#13;
analyses in three broad areas have been conducted: (a) education and poverty reduction;&#13;
(b) financial analysis; and (c) quality and internal efficiency improvement. The findings&#13;
are summarized briefly in the following. Details are given in the background documents&#13;
prepared for such analyses and can be found in the project file for economic analysis.&#13;
A. EDUCATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION&#13;
2.    This area is concerned with the issue of whether the project will contribute to&#13;
poverty reduction and benefit its intended population groups. Four types of analyses&#13;
have been conducted: the relationship between education and income in rural China;&#13;
strategies for targeting project resources; mobilization of additional education funds for&#13;
poor counties; and financial assistance to poor students.&#13;
Review of Studies on Education and Income in Rural China&#13;
3.    There is a large English literature on the relationship between education and&#13;
income. Studies in many countries (not including China) have found that individuals&#13;
with higher levels of education have higher income and that the rates of return to&#13;
education are generally positive and substantial (Psacharopoulos, 1994; Lockheed,&#13;
Jamison &amp; Lau, 1980). In order to find out the education-income relationship in China,&#13;
the mission has asked the Institute of Higher Education at Peking University to conduct a&#13;
review of such studies in the Chinese literature since the 1980s. The review finds that&#13;
there are very few studies of education and income in China. However, there are three&#13;
studies that estimate the private rate of return to education. The private rates are all&#13;
positive though they are somewhat lower than the average private rates for other countries&#13;
in the English literature. For example, a study based on 1992 data on rural households in&#13;
Guizhou province found that the private rate was 9.7 percent for primary education and&#13;
7.8 percent for lower-secondary education. Nevertheless, these rates were higher than&#13;
those reported in another study of rural households in China in 1986 (Jamison, 1987).&#13;
The apparent increase in the private rate over time is consistent with Schultz's hypothesis&#13;
that the effectiveness of education is enhanced in a modernizing environment (Schultz,&#13;
1976). But there are too few studies from which to draw any definitive conclusion about&#13;
the pattern of private rates of return to education in rural areas in China over time.&#13;
Further research is needed to determine the magnitude of the education-income&#13;
relationship and its pattern over time in the changing environment in China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Targeting Strategies&#13;
4.    To enhance the efficiency of education investment in this project, four types of&#13;
strategies have been employed in project design for targeting project resources toward its&#13;
intended population groups. The first type is geographical targeting by which only&#13;
nationally-designated poor counties in the project provinces are included in the project&#13;
(the so called 8-7 counties). The second type is ethnic targeting, which seeks to increase&#13;
the involvement of minority populations in project activities. The third type is gender&#13;
targeting, which promotes girls education in the project counties. A number of indicators&#13;
related to minority and girls education have been identified and will be used in project&#13;
monitoring. The project also incorporates a number of measures to promote girls and&#13;
minority education, including a student assistance program which gives particular&#13;
attention to girls and minority students. The fourth type of targeting seeks to place more&#13;
project investment in primary education than in lower-secondary education and to focus&#13;
more on incomplete primary schools (schools with grades I to 3 or 4) than on complete&#13;
primary schools (schools with grades I to 6). Throughout project preparation and&#13;
appraisal, the project investment costs in the project proposals presented by the seven&#13;
provinces were examined to encourage these four types of targeting. For more details,&#13;

Mobilization of Additional Education Funds for Poor Counties&#13;
5.    Additional funds for compulsory education will be provided by both the central&#13;
and provincial governments to the project counties.&#13;
6.    Central Compulsory Education Special Fund-Additional Part. The central&#13;
government has a compulsory education special fund to support the development of&#13;
compulsory education in poor counties, including the project counties. The "regular part"&#13;
of the special fund amounts to Y 350 million in 1995. The central government has&#13;
recently decided to provide an "additional part" to the special fund. The additional&#13;
resources represent a substantial increase in the fund. For example, by 1997, the&#13;
additional part will amount to Y 800 million, which is four times as large as the regular&#13;
part. The additional special fund will be used for improvement in school facilities, and&#13;
the provision of equipment, furniture, and books. The State Education Commission&#13;
(SEdC) has adopted IDA's project preparation and management procedure in distributing&#13;
the special fund to provinces. For example, each province will submit a proposal to&#13;
SEdC which will organize a national expert panel for reviewing the proposal. The&#13;
proposal will explain, among other things: (a) the development goals for compulsory&#13;
education; (b) resource requirements and financial feasibility; (c) the poor counties to be&#13;
included and the criteria for their inclusion (e.g., the counties should have good&#13;
management capacity and that they place emphasis on compulsory education); (d) how&#13;
the special fund will be used and distributed among the poor counties; and (e) the&#13;
availability of matching funds from provincial/prefecture/county levels (the total&#13;
matching fund from provincial, prefecture, and county levels should be two times that of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77 -                     ANNEX 12&#13;
the central fund). SEdC will subsequently conduct supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
utilization of the special fund in the provinces.&#13;
7.    Additional Provincial/Prefecture Education Funds. The project provinces will&#13;
provide additional funds to support compulsory education in the project counties. The&#13;
provincial government will also match the additional special fund from the central&#13;
government by a ratio of one to one. If a poor county cannot afford a one-to-one&#13;
matching of the central fund, the concerned prefecture government will provide fund to&#13;
make up for the gap. Some project provinces also provide seed money to the project&#13;
counties to set up a trust fund for financing a student-assistance program. Information on&#13;
the additional amount of central and provincial funds can be found in the project file.&#13;
A Student-Assistant Program&#13;
8.    Household Education Spending Survey. As part of the preparation of this&#13;
project, a survey of households in four project counties was conducted. The survey was&#13;
aimed at ascertaining the amount of household education spending, and assessing the&#13;
economic burden of such spending and its impact on access to basic education for&#13;
children from poor background. Two of the four counties were located in Hebei Province&#13;
and the other two counties in Gansu Province. Data were collected by the socioeconomic&#13;
survey teams of the State Statistics Bureau located in the concerned counties. One&#13;
hundred households in each county were selected based on the sampling method used by&#13;
the State Statistics Bureau in its annual survey of rural households in China.&#13;
9.    The survey found that households in these poor counties spent a significant&#13;
amount of their resources on the schooling of their children. The economic burden of&#13;
education spending was heavy for some households and these households had to borrow&#13;
money or receive subsidies from relatives and friends in order to send their children to&#13;
school. In one of the counties, the percentage of children aged 7-12 years not in school&#13;
was as high as 16 percent. Among parents who provided an explanation for their&#13;
children's absence from school, 55-60 percent indicated economic burden to be the&#13;
reason for the absence. The findings of the survey were discussed with representatives&#13;
from Gansu, Hebei, and SEdC. The survey provided empirical evidence that supports a&#13;
student assistance program being developed by SEdC and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
10.   National Guidelines For A Student Assistance Program. Education officials at&#13;
various levels recognize the economic burden of household education spending and its&#13;
negative impact on access to compulsory schooling. SEdC and the Ministry of Finance&#13;
have drafted guidelines for the establishment and strengthening of a student-assistance&#13;
program; and these guidelines are being circulated among provincial officials. According&#13;
to the guidelines, interest proceeds from a trust fund will be used to provide financial&#13;
assistance to students from poor background. The trust fund will be financed from&#13;
contributions from various levels of government. However, poor students will not&#13;
receive cash payments from the fund. Instead, they will receive varying amounts of&#13;
reduction in their payments to the school for textbooks, miscellaneous school fees, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                     ANNEX 12&#13;
other household costs on schooling, depending on their needs. Provincial education&#13;
authorities will be required to develop detailed procedures for the operation and&#13;
monitoring of the student-assistance program, in accordance with the needs and&#13;
conditions of the provinces.&#13;
11.   Project Activities On Student Assistance. As a subcomponent of this project,&#13;
the student-assistance program will be piloted in all of the project counties. Between 1.9&#13;
and 6.3 percent of the counterpart funds of the various project provinces will be allocated&#13;
to this subcomponent. The project provinces will develop guidelines for: (a) eligibility&#13;
for assistance (including special treatment of poor female and minority students);&#13;
(b) procedure for applying for assistance and evaluation of applications; (c) financing of&#13;
the trust fund; and (d) management and monitoring of the program. It is estimated that, at&#13;
the primary level, the subcomponent will cover between 6.4 and 27.7 percent of the poor&#13;
students in the project counties annually (see project file for more details).&#13;
12.   The mission has made the following requests to the project provinces: (a) using a&#13;
higher proportion of the interest proceeds from the trust fund on primary students than on&#13;
lower-secondary students; (b) giving higher priority to poor female and minority students,&#13;
especially in counties with relatively low female and minority participation in&#13;
compulsory education; (c) considering the use of a small part of the central compulsory&#13;
education special fund as seed money for the program; and (d) developing a program plan&#13;
for 1996-2000 (to indicate the coverage of poor students over time and the financing&#13;
sources, including the trust fund, the Hope Foundation, work-study program and&#13;
production in school, etc.).&#13;
B. FINANCIAL ANALYSES&#13;
13.   To ensure that the project is feasible during the project years and that project&#13;
effectiveness is sustained after project completion, three types of financial analyses have&#13;
been conducted: feasibility analysis, sustainability analysis, and assessment of the&#13;
availability of counterpart funding.&#13;
Financial Feasibility&#13;
14.   Financial feasibility analysis has been conducted at three levels: county level,&#13;
provincial level, and national level.&#13;
15.   County Level.  Officials in each project province were asked to provide&#13;
information on the required resources (recurrent and capital) and available resources for&#13;
compulsory education in the project counties during 1996-2000. The required resources&#13;
were found to exceed available resources for project counties in some of the provinces.&#13;
For these provinces, the deficit was eliminated by a number of measures, including the&#13;
lowering of development goals for compulsory education in the project counties and the&#13;
commitment of additional provincial and central funds. The total domestic resource and&#13;
its distribution is shown in the following table. Compared to the actual distribution of&#13;
domestic sources in 1994, the distribution for 1996-2000 has a somewhat higher&#13;
&#13;

16.      Provincial Level.   Officials from   each  project province  were  also  asked  to&#13;
provide information on the required resources (both recurrent and capital) and available&#13;
resources for supporting the planned developments for compulsory education for the&#13;
entire province, for the period 1996-2000. The comparison of required resources and&#13;
available resources at the provincial level was undertaken to assess the financial&#13;
feasibility of the planned developments in the province and to ensure that the project will&#13;
not have negative financial impacts on nonproject counties. The result indicates that&#13;
required resources exceeded available resources for two of the seven project provinces.&#13;
The development targets for these provinces were subsequently revised to reduce the&#13;
required resources (so as to match available resources). The following table gives the&#13;
total domestic resources available and the distribution arnong sources. Compared to the&#13;
actual distribution of domestic sources in 1994, the distribution for 1996-2000 has a&#13;
somewhat higher percentage for government allocation and correspondingly lower&#13;
percentages for the other sources, for all the provinces except Gansu (see project file for&#13;
more details).&#13;

17.   National Level. SEdC has informed the mission that it has conducted a financial&#13;
feasibility analysis for the development of compulsory education in all the 592 "8-7"&#13;
counties for the period 1996-2000. The analysis estimated the financial gaps in these&#13;
counties. In an effort to eliminate the projected gap, the central government will provide&#13;
an additional Y 3.9 billion in special fund for compulsory education to poor counties&#13;
during the 1995-97 period. More of such fund will be provided after 1997. Provinces&#13;
and poor counties will be required to match the central funding (prefectures and cities&#13;
may assist poor counties that have difficulty in matching central funds). Assuming&#13;
continued economic growth during 1996-2000 and beyond, the central government aims&#13;
to achieve nine-year compulsory education in the entire country in the early years of the&#13;
next century (as presented in the "Outline for Reform and Development of Education in&#13;
China" in 1994). To promote an equitable distribution of available central and external&#13;
resources for poor counties, SEdC has informed the mission that poor counties that are&#13;
included in externally funded projects (such as Third Basic Education Project funded by&#13;
IDA) will receive a smaller share of the central funds compared to poor counties not in&#13;
such projects.&#13;
Financial Sustainability&#13;
18.   The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected&#13;
total recurrent cost of compulsory education in project counties in 2001 with the&#13;
projected recurrent budget for compulsory education in project counties in 2001. Total&#13;
recurrent cost in 2001 is the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and&#13;
nonpersonnel inputs in 2001 and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the project.&#13;
TIhe total annual recurrent cost implication of the project is equal to the sum of the annual&#13;
costs needed to maintain the effectiveness of project investments in school buildings,&#13;
equipment, furniture, and technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual cost of&#13;
maintenance of an education input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient for that&#13;
input and the project investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across education&#13;
inputs and across project counties. It is between 2 and 3 percent for school buildings,&#13;
between 3 and 4 percent for equipment, between I and 2 percent for furniture, and&#13;
between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected recurrent budget in&#13;
2001 was estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in 1994 and a&#13;
historical growth rate.&#13;
19.   The analysis shows that the project was clearly not sustainable in two of the seven&#13;
provinces. The development targets and project size for the counties in these two&#13;
provinces were reduced. Though the project appears to be sustainable for the counties in&#13;
a third province, the recurrent budget in 2001 was based on a somewhat optimistic&#13;
growth rate; the development targets and project size were also reduced for this province.&#13;
The project was found to be sustainable for the counties in the other four provinces. The&#13;
final results of the analysis are incorporated in the revised feasibility reports prepared by&#13;
the provincial representatives (see project file). The aggregate results for the project&#13;
counties are given in the following table.&#13;

Availability of Counterpart Funding&#13;
20.      Before appraisal, the ratio of total counterpart funding to total IDA  investment&#13;
was 1.12. The analyses of feasibility at the county and provincial levels and of&#13;
sustainability at the county level indicate that the development targets have been set too&#13;
high by provincial and county officials. An examination of the financial sources for the&#13;
proposed counterpart funding also indicates that counterpart funds can be a burden on the&#13;
limited education resources of some of the project counties (see details in project file).&#13;
Thus, the provincial officials at the appraisal meeting were requested to adjust the&#13;
development targets to keep required resources in line with available resources. At the&#13;
same time, the size of the project was reduced by reducing counterpart funding from the&#13;
project provinces. The extent of reduction in counterpart funding for each province was&#13;
based on several considerations, including financial feasibility, project sustainability,&#13;
proportion of counterpart funding provided by provincial and prefecture governments, the&#13;
burden of counterpart funding on project counties over the duration of the project (and&#13;
especially at the height of project implementation), and the financial health of provincial&#13;
and county governments. The resultant total counterpart funding is equal to 89 percent of&#13;
the total IDA investment. The results are given in the following table.&#13;

C. INTERNAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
Simulation In Recurrent Cost Savings By Reducing Repetition Rates&#13;
21.    One of the effects of the project is the reduction in repetition rates of compulsory&#13;
education in project counties. This increase in internal efficiency will result in recurrent&#13;
cost savings, which can be used to expand new enrollments and/or improve education&#13;
quality. This analysis simulates the recurrent cost savings in grade 1.&#13;
22.    Data from  the six provinces in the Education Development in Poor Province&#13;
(EDPP) Project shows that, between 1988 and 1995, repetition rate in grade I decreased&#13;
by an average of 8 percent per year (that is, repetition rate in a given year is equal to 0.92&#13;
of the repetition rate in the previous year). This rate was used to estimate the recurrent&#13;
cost savings in the project counties in the Third Basic Education Project and the results&#13;
are given in the following table (details of analysis are given in the project file).&#13;
However, the reduction in repetition rates in the EDPP Project was due to a combination&#13;
of two factors: quality improvement (such as better trained teachers, provision of&#13;
instructional materials, etc.) and administrative policy (school principals were told to&#13;
reduce the number of repeaters). And it is not clear what proportion of the reduction was&#13;
due to quality improvement and what proportion was due to administrative policy. The&#13;
table provides three sets of estimates of the ratio of recurrent cost savings to investment&#13;
in primary education in the project counties, corresponding to three different assumptions&#13;
about the proportion of contribution due to quality improvement. The results pertain to&#13;
grade 1 only; the ratio will be several times larger if recurrent cost savings in grades 2 to&#13;
6 are included.&#13;

23.    There are significant variations in the ratios among the seven provinces, due to a&#13;
number of factors. First, the recurrent cost per student varied between Y 180 per student&#13;
for Anhui to Y 534 per student for Fujian. Second, the provinces have different repetition&#13;
rates in grade I in 1995 and the total reductions in the value of the repetition rates are also&#13;
different. For example, repetition rate will drop from 2.60 percent to 1.86 percent in Jilin&#13;
and from 22.80 percent to 16.34 percent in Qinghai. Third, the per-student investment in&#13;
primary education is also different among the provinces.&#13;

Learning Achievement as Outcome Measure&#13;
24.   Two new efficiency indicators will be added to the list of indicators for project&#13;
monitoring. They are measures of learning achievement in numeracy and basic literacy.&#13;
Each project province has been asked to develop its own efficiency indicators and pilot&#13;
the use of these indicators in the project counties. In addition, the central component of&#13;
the project will support a study of learning achievement in all seven project provinces.&#13;
The objectives of such activities are: (a) to develop the process for collecting information&#13;
on learning achievement; (b) to monitor progress in learning achievement in project&#13;
counties; and (c) to provide an outcome measure for assessing the performance of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Strengthening SEdC's Capacity for Economic Analysis for the Fourth Basic&#13;
Education Project&#13;
25.   As a result of the economic analysis in the Third Basic Education Project, SEdC&#13;
has gained experience in several areas of economic analysis, including financial-&#13;
feasibility analysis, financial-sustainability analysis, assessment of the availability of&#13;
counterpart funding, empirical study and program development related to student&#13;
assistance, and simulation of cost savings through improvement in internal efficiency.&#13;
The data-gathering capacity will be developed in project counties for monitoring learning&#13;
achievement. The review of existing studies on the relationship between education and&#13;
income in rural China has also identified areas for further empirical investigation. These&#13;
experiences and activities will provide a solid foundation for a sound economic analysis&#13;
in the preparation of the Fourth Basic Education Project.&#13;
D. SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
26.   In summary, the economic analysis undertaken during project preparation and&#13;
appraisal has: (a) resulted in the revisions of provincial proposals to ensure that the&#13;
project is financially feasible during the project years and that project effectiveness is&#13;
sustainable after project completion; (b) encouraged more central and provincial funding&#13;
for compulsory education in the project counties; (c) clarified and adjusted the amount of&#13;
counterpart funding and thus reduced the risk of a shortage in counterpart funding during&#13;
the implementation of the project; (d) provided the empirical basis for a student&#13;
assistance program to be piloted in the project; (e) modified project design so that project&#13;
components and investment are more closely tied to project goals; (f) raised the&#13;
awareness of Chinese counterparts about the importance and usefulness of economic&#13;
analysis in project design and appraisal; and (g) laid the foundation for a sound economic&#13;
analysis for the Fourth Basic Education Project in China.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Third Basic
            Education Project are to: 1) support the attainment of
            universal primary education and the expansion of coverage of
            lower secondary education in poor and minority areas; and 2)
            build stronger institutions responsible for education
            delivery. The project will support the government's
            efforts to make primary education universal by the year 2000
            by putting more educational inputs into teaching points,
            increasing the enrollment in complete schools, expanding
            multigrade and multisubject teaching in rural areas, and
            reducing dropouts rates of minority children through
            improved bilingual educational programs. The project
            consists of the following components: 1) an institutional
            component comprising: (a) facilities upgrading; (b)
            instructional equipment, furniture and books; and (c) staff
            upgrading; 2) a management improvement component including:
            (a) local education management training; (b) project
            management training; and (c) expansion of education
            management information system; and 3) a central component
            consisting of: (a) national training; (b) research
            dissemination program; (c) stipend program; (d) study tours;
            (e) experts panel; and (f) studies.
