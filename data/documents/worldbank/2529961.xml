             The Costs of Corruption for the Poor--&#13;
             The Energy Sector&#13;
&#13;
Laszlo Lovei    In recent years the fight against corruption has assumed a key place in development policy, as a&#13;
and Alastair&#13;
                way of strengthening economic growth and helping civil society and democracy to function.&#13;
McKechnie&#13;
                Corruption not only stifles growth. It also perpetuates or deepens inequality, as the few amass&#13;
&#13;
                power and wealth at the expense of the many. The energy sector lends itself to corrupt practices.&#13;
&#13;
                This is a result both of its traditional institutional arrangements--dominated by state monopolies&#13;
&#13;
                controlling oil, gas, or electricity--and of the sheer amount of cash it can generate. Corruption in&#13;
&#13;
                energy takes many forms, from petty corruption in meter reading and billing to grand corruption&#13;
&#13;
                in the allocation of lucrative monopolies. These practices differ in scale but contribute to the same&#13;
&#13;
                results--weak operational and financial performance and, for the poor in particular, declining&#13;
&#13;
                service quality or reduced chances of ever accessing network services. The answer to corruption&#13;
&#13;
                is continuing reform, to reduce the incentive and potential to capture monopoly rents and to&#13;
&#13;
                increase the transparency of public and private transactions, regulatory structures, and&#13;
&#13;
                decisionmaking processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                The energy sector, with its complex mix of pub-            dence from case studies suggests that illegal pay-&#13;
                lic and private actors and often enshrined cen-            offs can lower the quality of public works pro-&#13;

                This sector generates substantial cash transac-            30Â­50 percent (Rose-Ackerman 1996). And there&#13;
                tions compared with other infrastructure sectors,          is reason to believe that the costs of corruption&#13;
                not only in both small and large capital-intensive         are disproportionately borne by the poor--that&#13;

     For ease of discussion, some common forms of        Petty corruption is most prevalent at the interface&#13;

            The costs of corruption for the poor : the
            energy sector
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In recent years the fight against
            corruption has assumed a key place in development policy, as
            a way of strengthening economic growth and helping civil
            society and democracy to function. Corruption not only
            stifles growth. It also perpetuates or deepens inequality,
            as the few amass power and wealth at the expense of the
            many. The energy sector lends itself to corrupt practices.
            This is a result both of its traditional institutional
            arrangements-dominated by state monopolies controlling oil,
            gas, or electricity-and of the sheer amount of cash it can
            generate. Corruption in energy takes many forms, from petty
            corruption in meter reading and billing to grand corruption
            in the allocation of lucrative monopolies. These practices
            differ in scale but contribute to the same results-weak
            operational and financial performance and, for the poor in
            particular, declining service quality or reduced chances of
            ever accessing network services. The answer to corruption is
            continuing reform, to reduce the incentive and potential to
