AGRICULTURE SECTOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
This MOP and Technical Annex in based on the findings of an appraisal mission in April 1994. The&#13;
mission was composed of Tijan M. Sallah (Mission Leader, sconomist), Dirk van der Bluijs (senior&#13;
Agriculturist), and Nejdet Al-Salihi (Senior Irrigation Engineer). In the preappraisal mission of&#13;
December 1993, the following also participated: Lynn Engstrand (Agribusiness Specialist), Orlando&#13;
Sacay (Senior Financial Analyst), Willem Zijp (Senior Extension Specialist), Tjaart Schillhorn van&#13;
Veen (Senior Livestock Specialist), John Fraser Stewart (Consultant, Bnvironment Specialist), and&#13;
Bjorn Larsen (Consultant, Economist)  Mr. Srish Kumar provided assistance with the cost tables, and&#13;
Ms. Rose Rehman with the typing, while the internal consistency and conformity of the document with&#13;
Bank' e operational policy was checked by Mr. Sant Khorana. Poer reviewers for the project are Messrs.&#13;
Anders Bjorgung (NN2CO) and Usaid I. El-Hanbali (EA2AG). This report was prepared under the overall&#13;
supervision of Mrs. Ngozi Okonjo-lweala, Chief (MN2AG) up to September 30, 1994 and now Mr. Salah&#13;
Darghouth, Chief (M2AG), and approved by Mr. Ram K. Chopra, Director (KN2), and Mr. Caio Koch-Meaer,&#13;

I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR&#13;
A. The Sectoral and Economic Contexts&#13;
1.1    The agriculture sector in Jordan is small in relation to the overall&#13;
economy, but it is relatively important in the production of tradable goods.&#13;
Agriculture contributes about 7% to Jordan's GDP, employs 101 of the&#13;
workforce, and accounts for 15% of total exports. Upstream and downstream&#13;
linkages between agriculture and the overall economy are strong; a 1993 USAID&#13;
study notes that, on a broad definition of agriculture, 28% of GDP is&#13;
dependent on the sector (including inputs and producer services and downstream&#13;
marketing and processing). Also, on this broad definition, agriculture&#13;
accounted for more than half of the growth of GDP in recent years.&#13;
1.2    Of Jordan's overall area of 9 million ha, only about 0.5 million ha&#13;
are cultivable. Most of this cultivable land is in the Highlands. Rainfed&#13;
agriculture occupies some 450,000 ha, and irrigated agriculture covers about&#13;
30,000 ha in the Jordan Valley (and Southern Ghors) and 35,000 ha in the&#13;
Highlands. There are about 90,000 farms in Jordan and some 100,000 farmers&#13;
and livestock producers. An estimated 20,000 of the farmers are engaged in&#13;
irrigated crop production, 33,000 farmers in rainfed crop production, 26,000&#13;
in rainfed mixed farming and 20,000 in livestock production.&#13;
B. The Main Constraints Affecting Arriculture&#13;
1.3    Major constraints to the development of sustainable agriculture in&#13;
Jordan are: water scarcity, weak producer services and vulnerable markets.&#13;
In addition, the policy environment has hitherto not been conducive to&#13;
efficiency. Water resources are severely limited, and declining both in&#13;
quantity and quality. The country is largely arid or semi-arid, with some 96&#13;
percent of the land receiving less than 300 mm of precipitation per year.&#13;
Hence, irrigation is important. Agriculture accounts for almost three-&#13;
quarters of total water consumption. Investments in irrigation in the 1970s&#13;
and 1980s allowed intensification and increases in agricultural output. This&#13;
expansion was accompanied by shifts in cropping patterns to higher value crops&#13;
that further increased incomes. However, no additional sources of surface&#13;
water exist that can be economically harnessed, and pumping of groundwater&#13;
exceeds renewable levels. Because water demand for municipal and industrial&#13;
use outstrips supply and is rising fast, major changes in water use are&#13;
required, together with better planning and management of this scarce&#13;
resource.&#13;
1.4    Agricultural productivity, in terms of returns to both water and&#13;
labor, is relatively high but can be improved. There is scope for further&#13;
improvement in irrigation efficiencies in the Jordan Valley, which has&#13;
irrigation efficiencies of only 42% in the northern section now and cropping&#13;
intensities of only 100-120%. Achieving higher productivity would require&#13;
improving farmers' technology. This could be achieved by farmer education and&#13;
training and by improving the focus and delivery of research, extension and&#13;
other producer services. A particular need is to make such services more&#13;
demand-driven and farmer-focussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1.5    Markets for Jordanian agricultural produce are also a problem.&#13;
Exports have historically been dependent on the politically vulnerable&#13;
regional market. Past growth in horticultural exports was in the Gulf&#13;
markets. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar and Bahrain together took about&#13;
88 percent (500,000 tons) of total exports of fresh fruits and vegetables in&#13;
1990. The remaining volume was divided between other Arab states which took&#13;
about 11 percent (62,000 tons) and Europe which took about one percent (6,000&#13;
tons). Because of the Gulf War, markets in the Gulf have shrunk and export&#13;
prospects have eroded. Presently, export capability lags behind production&#13;
capability. The local market, although growing fast, is relatively small and&#13;
cannot absorb all surplus production. As a result, there have been reductions&#13;
in farmers' incomes.&#13;
1.6    There is recognition of the need to diversify out of the volatile Gulf&#13;
markets into the relatively more stable, fast growing markets of West Europe.&#13;
These markets, however, are more demanding in their quality requirements.&#13;
These considerations call for substantial improvements in produce quality in&#13;
Jordan, in terms of better standards of production, post-harvest handling and&#13;
packaging. To serve the European market, Jordan would also need improvement&#13;
in market information and logistics to monitor the demands of off-season,&#13;
niche markets in Europe and to respond to them in time. Based on a 1991&#13;
study, there are at least 12 crops where Jordan has a definite commercial&#13;
potential; i.e., strawberry, grape, asparagus, melon, green bean, eggplant,&#13;
tomatoes, pepper, peach, nectarine, cherry and raspberry. The same study&#13;
recommended off-season exports through niche market windows targeted at four&#13;
principal European markets (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and&#13;
Switzerland).&#13;
1.7    The problems faced by Jordanian agriculture are not just technical and&#13;
institutional, but also structural. Current government policy protects the&#13;
sector but also inhibits change and has permitted an inefficient use of land&#13;
and water resources. Effectively, the prospects for the sector depend on its&#13;
ability to adapt to use of water with increasing efficiency, to produce for&#13;
new markets, and to switch to new, higher value products. There is&#13;
substantial scope for improvements in productivity and profitability within&#13;
existing resource limitations, but exceptional measures are needed to bring&#13;
about the required structural changes in Jordanian agriculture. For these&#13;
reasons, the Government is embarking on an adjustment program in the sector to&#13;
effect the transition to a more sustainable and efficient use of diminishing&#13;
resources. Government's program covers improvements in the management of&#13;
water and land resources, market liberalization and institutional development.&#13;
C. Sector Institutions and Issues&#13;
1.8    A number of institutions are involved in water development and&#13;
management, and in providing producer services. These institutions, varying in&#13;
scale and complexity, are described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1.9    Ministry of Water and Irrigation.  The Ministry of Water and&#13;
Irrigation (MWI) has overall responsibility for water planning and management&#13;
countrywide. Until 1992, MWI was little more than an umbrella for its two&#13;
operating arms, the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) and the Water Authority of&#13;
Jordan (WAJ). JVA is responsible for all irrigation development and&#13;
management, and WAJ has responsibility for national municipal water supply&#13;
(including in the Jordan Valley). The roles and responsibilities of JVA and&#13;
WAJ overlap, resulting in duplication of effort, lack of coordination and&#13;
consequent wastage of water resources. Because of this unsatisfactory&#13;
situation, MWI brought about some needed changes in 1993. It established a&#13;
new unit in the Ministry itself, under a Secretary General, at a level equal&#13;
to that of JVA and WAJ. The new unit is responsible for all water resource&#13;
planning, policy and strategy formulation, human resource development, and&#13;
data collection and analysis. JVA and WAJ are now the operational arms of the&#13;
MWI, responsible for project and program implementation. Most recently, Basin&#13;
Protection Units (BPUs) were established within WAJ to oversee groundwater&#13;
monitoring and control. These are mobile technical units which have initially&#13;
inventoried groundwater wells, and which will be responsible under the ASAL&#13;
supported adjustment program for implementing the groundwater basin management&#13;
programs.&#13;
1.10   Ministry of Agriculture.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is&#13;
responsible for agricultural policy and development. MOA coordinates its&#13;
program through 15 headquarters departments, each under a department director,&#13;
and through 19 regional directorates, each headed by a regional director. The&#13;
regional directors and the department directors at headquarters report to the&#13;
Secretary General of MOA.   The Director of the National Center for&#13;
Agricultural Research and Technology Transfer (NCARTT) also reports to the&#13;
Secretary General. NCARTT is a specialized agency of the MOA. The key issues&#13;
for MOA are to adapt structure and staffing to the new more limited mandate&#13;
defined in the sector policy; to implement privatization, commercialization&#13;
and other forms of decentralization; and to make public services more&#13;
productive and better managed.&#13;
1.11   Research.  Most public sector research is carried out by NCARTT; the&#13;
Faculties of Agriculture (FOA) of the University of Jordan and some other&#13;
universities also conduct some research. Some adaptive research is undertaken&#13;
by private input supply companies on themes related to intensified input use.&#13;
There is scope for public research on themes that commercial research will not&#13;
deal with, and NCARTT has, in principle, the mandate and the capacity to&#13;
conduct this research. The institution, created in 1985, as a specialized&#13;
agency of the MOA, has its headquarters and impressive, large-scale physical&#13;
facilities (built with USAID's assistance) in Baqa, near Amman. NCARTT&#13;
operates six Regional Agricultural Service Centers (RASCs, four of which were&#13;
also established with USAID funding), covering the main agro-ecological zones&#13;
of the country. NCARTT's staff (230 personnel) is small in relation to its&#13;
generous physical facilities, but fairly large in relation to the size of the&#13;
agriculture sector. NCARTT has a number of highly qualified staff (11 PhD, 31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
MSc); however, the FOA of the University of Jordan, which offers better pay&#13;
and incentives, has more highly qualified staff (63 PhD).&#13;
1.12   Although NCARTT is charged with the mandate for coordinating and&#13;
carrying out research and technology transfer at the national level, its&#13;
research function is quite limited and not very practical. Communications&#13;
with extension staff and farmers are scant, and farmers, particularly the&#13;
farmers and livestock producers in the rainfed highlands, are receiving little&#13;
benefit. A national strategy for agricultural research, including action on&#13;
the institutional status of NCARTT, has been developed with ISNAR/ICARDA&#13;
assistance. The essence of the new research strategy is to improve research&#13;
planning, budgeting and program design; reactivate the six RASCs; and improve&#13;
research extension linkages. Working groups on the strategy have produced a&#13;
draft. Meanwhile, NCARTT has started to move away from its commodity-based&#13;
research programs and has reorganized work along thematic lines such as&#13;
rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, range management and water&#13;
management.&#13;
1.13   Extension.  The history of extension in the MOA dates back to 1954,&#13;
fifteen years after the establishment of the Ministry itself. Over the years,&#13;
the extension service has had widely varying mandates, from rural reform to&#13;
home economics, and from rural literacy to technology transfer. Between 1986&#13;
and 1992, extension was part of NCARTT's mandate, but the responsibility&#13;
returned to MOA in 1992, to its newly created Department of Extension and&#13;
Information (DORI). DOlI has 96 staff in the field (with 63 reported field&#13;
vacancies unlikely to be filled soon) and 16 staff at headquarters in Amman&#13;
(which also has 16 vacancies). Of the field staff, nine are female; at&#13;
headquarters, six are female. The formal education of extension field staff&#13;
is relatively high: more than 90 percent have at least a bachelor's degree.&#13;
However, their knowledge is mostly theoretical and has not kept abreast of&#13;
recent developments, particularly in such fields as horticulture and&#13;
integrated pest management (IPM) where changes are rapid. Moreover, many do&#13;
not have farm experience, nor do they have much training in extension methods.&#13;
1.14   The private sector is quite active and successful in extension, and is&#13;
clearly the main engine in the development of irrigated agriculture and&#13;
horticulture, although it does not deal adequately with such areas as IPM and&#13;
does not reach poorer farmers. Private extension organizations can be divided&#13;
into farmer organizations, which provide advisory services to a relatively&#13;
better-off clientele; non-governmental organizations, which focus on resource-&#13;
poor farmers and usually have environmental and gender-based agendas; and&#13;
comercial companies, which cater strictly to those who can afford their&#13;
products and services. Over 100 commercial agricultural service companies&#13;
operate in Jordan, in areas as wide ranging as input supply, seed supply,&#13;
nurseries, plastic house supply, irrigation equipment, agricultural machinery,&#13;
test and diagnostic laboratories, veterinary services and on-farm trials and&#13;
training.&#13;

TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1.15   Presently, most farmers get about 50 percent of their information from&#13;
other farmers, 25 percent from public extension and about 13 percent from&#13;
private extension. There are weekly radio and TV broadcasts of extension&#13;
information in cooperation with the MOA but their impact on farmers and&#13;
livestock herders is limited.&#13;
1.16   Donors.  Major donors active in the agriculture and water sectors of&#13;
Jordan are the Deutsche Gesselschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) or&#13;
German Agency for Technical Cooperation, Kreditanstalt fifr Wiederaufbau (KfW)&#13;
or German Credit Agency for Reconstruction, United States Agency for&#13;
International Development (USAID), French Cooperation, Canadian International&#13;
Development Agency (CIDA), and the European Community (EC). German technical&#13;
assistance in agriculture is largely concentrated on pest control and seed&#13;
multiplication technologies, export promotion assistance, and agricultural&#13;
extension. In addition, German support is provided to the water sector&#13;
(drinking water, sewage, irrigation, etc) with the objective to improve&#13;
operation and maintenance among other things. USAID assistance has been&#13;
concentrated on NCARTT and on an Agricultural Marketing Development Project&#13;
through the government's Agricultural Marketing Organization (AMO). USAID&#13;
also has a large project in support of the water sector. French assistance is&#13;
being provided for agricultural research and horticulture production.&#13;
Canadian assistance is largely focussed on agricultural technologies (e.g.,&#13;
potato seed development, lentil mechanization program, and biotechnology&#13;
development program) and on institutional support in the water sector. The&#13;
European Community is providing assistance on national soil mapping and land&#13;
use, improvement of arid and semi-arid zones, and awassi sheep improvement.&#13;
These activities demonstrate that there is a relatively active donor&#13;
community. However, donor coordination is weak, and there is scope for&#13;
improvement. The proposed Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) by the&#13;
World Bank and KfW, and the complementary support program, the Agriculture&#13;
Sector Technical Assistance Program (ASTAP), are serving as important&#13;
catalysts for donor cooperation in agriculture and water.&#13;
II.  THE SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR AGRIC      E&#13;
A. The Agriculture Sector Technical Assistance Proaram (ASTAP)&#13;
2.1    Government's reform program in water and agriculture is to be&#13;
supported by the World Bank and KfW with an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(ASAL). In order to ensure efficient implementation of the reforms and to help&#13;
build public and private sector capacity in services to the agriculture and&#13;
water sectors, Government has also requested Bank and donor assistance for a&#13;
broad program of technical support, studies and consultancies. A large number&#13;
of components were identified and prepared by FAO/CP on behalf of the&#13;
Government, and were incorporated in a broad program for donor financing&#13;
called the ASTAP. Taken together, ASTAP is expected to provide full support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
to implementation of the adjustment program. The program framework provides a&#13;
synoptic picture of the complete range of assistance to the water and&#13;
agriculture sectors, ensuring synergy and avoiding overlap. The framework is&#13;
also expected to serve as a tool for donor coordination.&#13;
2.2    ASTAP has a specific mandate to focus on farmers and production&#13;
systems affected by the adjustment program. It is anticipated that adjustment&#13;
will significantly change relative prices for farmers. The more efficient&#13;
farmers will take advantage of new market opportunities as trade is&#13;
liberalized, but may need support to adopt new production technology. At the&#13;
same time, income losses could affect farmers as subsidies are phased out and&#13;
barriers to imports are lifted or replaced by tariffs. Not all farmers will&#13;
be able to compensate for lost income and the number of farmers drawing very&#13;
low incomes from farming could increase. Particular risk categories are: in&#13;
the Jordan Valley, the smallest farmers, the renters and the sharecroppers; in&#13;
the irrigated Highlands, the sharecroppers; in mixed and livestock farms,&#13;
sheep and goat predominant systems, particularly the larger flocks; and cereal&#13;
producers in rainfed areas. In addition, the commercial dairy industry is&#13;
likely to become less profitable and at least some production units may close.&#13;
There is excess egg production capacity for the domestic market and once&#13;
subsidies are removed many producers may go out of business unless the export&#13;
market can be developed. ASTAP is designed to assist both higher potential&#13;
farmers and those farmers most vulnerable during the adjustment period. The&#13;
matching of ASAL reforms with ASTAP technical support is a visible sign of&#13;
Government's commitment to supporting producers during the transition.&#13;
Designed to improve the efficiency of response, ASTAP will help improve&#13;
benefits and mitigate adverse effects, and hence contribute to reducing the&#13;
political risks of the adjustment program.&#13;
2.3    The ASTAP program is summarized in Appendix 11 (page 45).  Appendix 11&#13;
also shows how each of the components is financed, or is expected to be&#13;
financed. Appendix 12 shows how each of the components is linked to the&#13;
adjustment program.&#13;
B. The Agriculture Sector Technical Support Proiect (ASTSUP)&#13;
2.4    Within ASTAP, Government has requested Bank, GTZ and KfW assistance&#13;
for an Agriculture Sector Technical Support Project (ASTSUP). ASTSUP has been&#13;
prepared and appraised in parallel with ASAL. It would be implemented&#13;
alongside ASAL as a free-standing, but closely-linked, project.&#13;
2.5    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The ASAL and ASTSUP are parallel,&#13;
mutually reinforcing operations, which have been designed in conformity with&#13;
the Bank's country assistance strategy in Jordan. The Bank assistance&#13;
strategy emphasizes continued stabilization, macroeconomic adjustments and&#13;
sectoral reforms over the period through 1997, as well as a steady program of&#13;
investments to remove constraints and enable growth. In particular, Bank&#13;
involvement in the ASTSUP will ensure that key activities central to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
success of the adjustment program are adequately carried out. In addition,&#13;
Government has sought Bank assistance to help catalyze maximum grant&#13;
cofinancing for ASTAP; Bank financing is expected to facilitate this within&#13;
the context of a coherent program of policy adjustment and investment.&#13;
2.6    Lessons from Previous Bank Projects.  ASTSUP and ASAL are the first&#13;
Bank operations in the agriculture sector for over a decade. In general,&#13;
lessons from Jordan on implementation with Bank projects across sectors have&#13;
been positive compared with other countries in the MENA region. However,&#13;
Bankwide lessons on the performance of TA projects have shown that, in order&#13;
to avoid failures: (i) the scale and complexity of TA should be tailored to&#13;
match the absorptive capacity of the recipient agencies; (ii) achievement of&#13;
simple, more realistic objectives should be firmly built into project design;&#13;
and (iii) borrower ownership of design is important for sustainability.&#13;
Although there are several agencies that would be involved in the&#13;
implementation of ASTSUP, components have been designed so as to accord with&#13;
the implementation capacity of these agencies. There is also general&#13;
ownership of project components. Nevertheless, intensive start-up and close&#13;
supervision at project launching would be necessary.&#13;
III.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Obiectives&#13;
3.1    The objectives of the project are to assist the Government in the&#13;
implementation of agricultural policy adjustments and to improve services to&#13;
farmers and livestock producers. The project would provide support for the&#13;
implementation of measures to protect and optimize use of surface and ground&#13;
water resources. It would also provide technical assistance to build&#13;
capacities in agricultural research and extension institutions to improve&#13;
services to producers, particularly those who are most vulnerable during&#13;
adjustment. Finally, it would develop monitoring and evaluation capacity to&#13;
enable the effects of adjustment to be tracked.&#13;
B. Proiect DescriRtion&#13;
3.2    Project components are: (a) water measurement and management in the&#13;
Jordan Valley; (b) groundwater basin monitoring and control; (c) research; (d)&#13;
extension; and (e) monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the adjustment&#13;
program.&#13;
Water Measurement and Management in the Jordan Valley. and Groundwater Basin&#13;
Monitoring and Control&#13;
3.3    Jordanian agriculture is faced with the specter of declining water&#13;
availability and declining water quality. The situation is expected to worsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
as population grows, and municipal and industrial demand for water increases.&#13;
Surface water flows to the Jordan Valley, which come mainly from the Yarmouk&#13;
River, have declined due to diversions by upstream riparians. Highland&#13;
groundwater resources are being depleted by overdrafting, and this is leading&#13;
to increased water salinity and pumping costs. A special case is the non-&#13;
renewable fossil groundwater of the Disi aquifer, from which about 60 million&#13;
cubic meters (mcm) (equivalent to 11 percent of Jordan's annual water supply)&#13;
is being abstracted annually for irrigation, largely to produce low value&#13;
cereals. Water quality is also a problem. The Zarqa River is contaminated by&#13;
pollutants from phosphate mines and from municipal and industrial wastes, and&#13;
this polluted water is conveyed to the King Talal Reservoir and used for&#13;
irrigation.&#13;
3.4    Within this overall water quantity constraint, the management, quality&#13;
and conservation of water could be improved. Government's adjustment program&#13;
for water, supported under the proposed ASAL, covers development of a national&#13;
water policy, restructuring of water sector institutions and a series of&#13;
supply and demand management measures designed to bring water resources under&#13;
control and conserve the resource. Supply management measures include a halt&#13;
to drilling of private wells for irrigation; progressive implementation of a&#13;
policy to manage groundwater withdrawal levels by enforcing volumetric&#13;
metering of all water production, supply and usage; and the phasing out of the&#13;
use of fossil groundwater for low value agriculture. Demand side measures are&#13;
to include enhanced rationing and pricing instruments and the development of&#13;
local water markets.&#13;
3.5    The proposed ASTSUP will provide support for this program through: (i)&#13;
Water Measurement and ManaQement in the Jordan Valley, which provides for&#13;
rehabilitation of farm turnouts in three areas of the Jordan Valley to permit&#13;
water measurement and equitable distribution of irrigation water, and to&#13;
improve operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the water conveyance system in the&#13;
Jordan Valley. In addition, support will be provided for the JVA laboratories&#13;
and-for training and technical assistance for water quality monitoring; (ii)&#13;
Groundwater Basin Monitoring and Control, and SuDport for WAJ, which provides&#13;
for groundwater basin monitoring and control in the Highlands by volumetric&#13;
measurement of tubewell abstraction, improvement of the groundwater&#13;
observation network and support for the recently established Basin Protection&#13;
Units. Support will also be provided to WAJ to improve water conveyance&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
3.6    Water Measurement and Management in the Jordan Valley. (Base Cost&#13;
US$5.15 million). This component will improve water measurement and&#13;
management of the piped irrigation system in the Jordan Valley. As part of the&#13;
adjustment program, Government is strengthening demand management in the&#13;
valley, and introducing higher irrigation water charges. Increases in charges&#13;
can only be-fair and effective as a demand management tool if delivered water&#13;
is correctly measured and billed. Therefore, it is necessary to complete the&#13;
ongoing program for installing secure meters and water flow control devices on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
irrigation turn-outs. The project would, therefore, finance the&#13;
rehabilitation of 2,150 improved farm turnouts and installation of about 3,450&#13;
water control devices (outlet pressure regulators, flow regulators, flow&#13;
meters, gate valves, flow limiters, etc.) and protection boxes for 1,350&#13;
outlets in three areas covering 7,500 ha in the Jordan Valley (i.e., Zarqa&#13;
Triangle, 18 km Extension and Northeast Ghor). The JVA has already prepared&#13;
draft bidding documents for procurement of equipment and installation for farm&#13;
turnouts. The JVA will supervise the dismantling of existing farm turnouts&#13;
and the installation of new ones, which will have protection boxes, steel&#13;
covers, locks and foundation works. To improve the capacity of JVA&#13;
laboratories to carry out water and soil testing, laboratory equipment and&#13;
vehicles will be provided. The project will also support JVA to improve O&amp;M&#13;
efficiency in the Jordan Valley by providing urgently needed O&amp;M equipment&#13;
identified by the December 1993 GTZ study.' This component will also include&#13;
training for JVA staff, provision of technical assistance to evaluate its&#13;
monitoring program, and laboratory equipment requirements, and needed studies.&#13;
3.7    Groundwater Basin Monitoring and Control. and SuDDort for WAJ. (Base&#13;
Cost US$3.06 million). As part of the adjustment program, Government is&#13;
adopting a program to move towards sustainable groundwater abstraction&#13;
nationwide, and implementing a full management program to meter and control&#13;
all groundwater production, supply and usage. This component would,&#13;
therefore, support monitoring and control currently being carried out by WAJ&#13;
through its ten Basin Protection Units (BPUs). WAJ is responsible for&#13;
groundwater control, and the BPUs have been set up specifically to improve&#13;
monitoring and control of groundwater abstraction. The project will finance&#13;
the purchase and installation of 2,300 flow meters on tubewells not equipped&#13;
under the ongoing program; 30 automatic groundwater level recorders and 25&#13;
electric water level meters to improve monitoring of groundwater levels; 20&#13;
portable conductivity meters and pH meters to improve monitoring of water&#13;
quality; 5 global positioning systems to assist in rapid determination of&#13;
tubewell coordinates; 15 PC and laptop computers and miscellaneous equipment,&#13;
office furniture for the BPUs; and 12 field vehicles. WAJ has furthermore&#13;
identified an urgent need for a small number of water tankers to improve water&#13;
conveyance efficiencies to high areas of Amman during peak demand periods of&#13;
the summer months.  In accordance with the objective of improving efficiency&#13;
of water use and delivery, support will be provided under ASTSUP of ten water&#13;
tankers. The tankers would be a less costly way of delivering water to high&#13;
areas of Amman than the existing piped system. The tankers would facilitate&#13;
spatial transfer of water from low to higher value uses, and would service&#13;
areas unserved by the small private tanker market. The project will also&#13;
provide training for the staff of WAJ in areas such as use of computers,&#13;
remote sensing and GIS.   KfW would finance this component under its Sector&#13;

Agricultural SuRRort Services&#13;
3.8    The Need for Agricultural Services.  In both the Jordan Valley and the&#13;
Highlands, intensive agriculture, dominated by horticulture, is practiced,&#13;
with substantial differences in technology and managerial levels. In the&#13;
Valley, irrigation is provided by a public network, partly from open canals,&#13;
and increasingly through pressurized gates which directly feed drip irrigation&#13;
systems. There are some subsidies- in particular, Jordan Valley farmers pay a&#13;
low water charge. In the Highlands, irrigation is provided mostly through&#13;
private wells at much higher cost to the users. In both areas, farmers'&#13;
access to agricultural support services depends on their wealth and the scale&#13;
of their operations. For example, in the Valley, relatively wealthy farmers&#13;
grow vegetables in specialized farms with plastic or green houses, using drip&#13;
irrigation. Some are operated by highly qualified technicians who maintain&#13;
regular contact with foreign growers and breeders from foreign seed companies.&#13;
These farmers may have their own variety trials and regular soil tests.&#13;
However, there are also poorer farmers who operate open field systems with&#13;
some vegetables and cereals (wheat or barley). These farmers have little&#13;
access to technical information, and rely on neighbors for tips on varieties,&#13;
fertilizer and pesticide use. There is scope for public agricultural services&#13;
to assist this category of farmers in particular and to deal with areas of&#13;
common interest, such as IPM and the environment. Similarly in Highlands&#13;
systems, there are inten ive commercial farms which can buy technology and&#13;
advice, and a larger number of poorer farmers who have little access to such&#13;
advice. The latter group includes the small-scale rainfed crop farmers in the&#13;
Highlands, the marginal livestock herders and female-headed agricultural&#13;
households.&#13;
3.9    DeveloRment Priorities and Plans for Agricultural Services.  Public&#13;
assistance should be conducted within a coherent agricultural sector policy&#13;
and strategy. Under Government's adjustment program, supported by the&#13;
proposed ASAL, policy guidelines and the role of the public sector in&#13;
agriculture are being defined in an Agriculture Policy Charter. A case has to&#13;
be made for public sector involvement, and there has to be clear&#13;
identification of the economic and environmental objectives of public service&#13;
provision. Government has recently developed a draft agricultural research&#13;
strategy, and is working on a program to develop agricultural extension, and a&#13;
program to overhaul the mandate, structure and management of MOA. To carry&#13;
out these policies and strategies, the proposed ASTSUP would provide limited&#13;
and targeted assistance to public agricultural research and extension,&#13;
focussing support on areas of potential or of public interest that could not&#13;
be served by other means and on particularly farming systems that are&#13;
vulnerable during the adjustment period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

TECHNICAL AlNEX&#13;
3.10   Research. (Base Cost US$0.79 million).  The adjustment program will&#13;
change relative prices, creating both new challenges and new pressures for&#13;
farmers. There is a need for a well-focussed public research program to help&#13;
Jordanian agriculture to adapt to the new economic realities, especially&#13;
bearing in mind farmers in vulnerable farming systems. The research&#13;
institution, NCARTT, is a large and well-equipped research organization with&#13;
six Regional Agricultural Service Centers. Research activity, however, is&#13;
hampered by NCARTT's inadequate management, which, until now, has also&#13;
suffered from lack of direction. The proposed ASTSUP would, therefore,&#13;
provide catalytic support to NCARTT to enable it to respond to the needs of&#13;
crop and livestock producers during adjustment. The project would finance:&#13;
(a) the hiring of an experienced internationally-recruited management&#13;
specialist to assist NCARTT to implement the new research strategy, guide and&#13;
motivate staff towards a stronger farmer focus, strengthen research planning&#13;
and budgeting capacity, reactivate the six regional research centers and&#13;
strengthen research-extension linkages; assurances were aiven at neaotiations&#13;
to ensure that the manaaement sDecialist would be hired by June 30. 1995 (Dara&#13;
s.1 (); (b) the implementation by NCARTT of a national workshop (with&#13;
international participation) for research, extension staff and MOA decision-&#13;
makers to discuss and launch the national research strategy; (c) the&#13;
organization by NCARTT of a ten-day course on integrated pest management (IPM)&#13;
to be conducted by an experienced internationally-recruited IPM specialist.&#13;
The course would be held during the latter part of the first year of the&#13;
project and would involve local researchers, extension staff, farmers and&#13;
private sector advisory staff as participants; and (d) 50 staff-months of&#13;
specialized, post-graduate training for research staff in priority areas such&#13;
as irrigation agronomy and dryland farming.&#13;
3.11   Extension. (Base Cost US$1.7 million).  The private sector is quite&#13;
active and successful in extension. Nonetheless, as with research, there is a&#13;
genuine public service role for extension that is not presently being met. In&#13;
Jordan, this public role concerns poorer farmers not served by private&#13;
information networks, and public goods such as soil conservation, integrated&#13;
pest management and water quality. Poorer farmers include those engaged in&#13;
rainfed, mixed and livestock farms in the Highlands, and extensive pastoral&#13;
systems. The joint working groups which elaborated the agricultural research&#13;
strategy (para. 1.12) recommended that the country's public extension service&#13;
should, in the future, focus its attention and efforts on those farmers and&#13;
livestock producers who would not be served by private advisory services.&#13;
3.12   ASTSUP would provide support to public extension interventions within&#13;
the framework of a formal extension strategy that is to be developed under the&#13;
project. The strategy would clarify the mandate of extension, the task&#13;
distribution between the DORI and NCARTT, and the role of the public extension&#13;
service.&#13;
3.13   This ASTSUP component would be cofinanced by GTZ (base cost US$1.45&#13;
million and the Bank (base cost US$250,000), as detailed below.&#13;

3.14   GTZ would finance the majority of the component.  Technical assistance&#13;
(1 long term internationally recruited specialist for 36 staff months; 2&#13;
locally recruited agricultural economists for 36 staff-months; 17 staff-months&#13;
of short-term internationally-recruited TA; 2 vehicles; 2 computers with&#13;
software, and 30 staff-months of basic training for extension staff) will be&#13;
provided to: (i) assist the Government in formulating a national agricultural&#13;
extension policy and strategy, and (ii) to undertake pilot operations in one&#13;
or two selected areas, whereby extension methodologies and approaches would be&#13;
tested at the community level.&#13;
3.15   To complement GTZ's support, the Bank would finance the following:  i)&#13;
short-term specialized training (local and overseas courses and study tours)&#13;
focussed on building extension capacity in such areas as extension methods,&#13;
diagnostic skills, and participatory rapid rural assessment; (ii) training-&#13;
related technical assistance, to conduct special courses of general interest,&#13;
in-country (12 staff-weeks); (iii) some office and audio-visual equipment; and&#13;
(iv) three vehicles.&#13;
3.16     Nonitoring and Evaluation.  (Base Cost US$0.66 million) The Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture is reinforcing its statistical and monitoring capacity and this&#13;
will be supported by a GTZ-financed component under ASTSUP. In order to track&#13;
the impact of adjustment on production and incomes, MOA will undertake special&#13;
surveys with a baseline survey before major reforms, and subsequent semi-&#13;
annual passes. Two complementary sets of surveys will be conducted: i) crop&#13;
budget surveys will track the evolution of gross margins for key geographical&#13;
areas and farming systems; and (ii) household income surveys will follow a&#13;
representative sample of farm households in key geographical areas and farming&#13;
systems, with a special focus on vulnerable populations and systems. Case&#13;
studies will also provide policy makers with insights into the impacts of&#13;
adjustment.&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financig&#13;
3.17     Cost Estimates.  Total project costs, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies, are estimated at JD 8.60 million (US$ 13.31 million&#13;
equivalent); the foreign exchange component represents about 88 percent (or&#13;
US$11.77 million) of total project costs. Base costs are calculated using&#13;
April 1994 prices. The estimated base costs amount to JD7.16 million or&#13;
US$11.37 million equivalent.&#13;
3.18     Project costs include allowances for both physical and price&#13;
contingencies. Physical contingencies, which have been applied largely on&#13;
equipment and vehicles, amount to 14 percent of base costs. Price&#13;
contingencies amount to 3 percent of base costs based on annual local&#13;
inflation rates of 4.5 percent for 1995-1998, and annual foreign inflation&#13;
rates of 1.9 percent for 1995, 2.7% for 1996, 3.4% for 1997, and 3.6% for&#13;
1998. Equipment and goods imported directly for use by Government ministries&#13;

and evaluation component and part of the extension component. KfW is&#13;
providing a further US$3.08 million equivalent. The financing package,&#13;
presented below, was agreed at negotiations. The Bank will provide for a loan&#13;

IV. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Prolect Implementation&#13;
4.1    The project would be implemented over a period of four and the half&#13;
years and is expected to be completed by June 1999. The project would be&#13;
implemented by MOA and MWI and their agencies which have adequate capacities&#13;
to carry out components. The implementing agencies will prepare annual plans&#13;
and budgets, implement subproject components, account for project expenditures&#13;
and present accounts for audit annually, and monitor progress and submit&#13;
annual progress reports. Approval of annual work programs and budgets will be&#13;
done by the Ministry of Planning. Administration of procurement contracts&#13;
will also be carried out by the implementing agencies which have the&#13;
experience and the capacity. The Ministry of Agriculture has appointed a&#13;
project coordinator from among existing staff, who will oversee the&#13;
coordination of project activities, consolidate progress reports and serve as&#13;
the point of contact for the Bank, GTZ, KfW and other interested parties.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were given that Government would assign to the&#13;
vrolect coordinator responsibilities for coordination of vroiect&#13;
implementation (para. 6.1 (a)).&#13;
4.2    Specific components will be carried out by the responsible government&#13;
agency. For the water measurement and management component, the JVA (an agency&#13;
of MWI) will be the implementing agency. WAJ, also an agency of MWI, will&#13;
implement the groundwater basin control component. The MOA and its specialized&#13;
agencies will implement the agricultural support services component: NCARTT&#13;
will implement the research subcomponent; DOEI will implement the extension&#13;
component; and the Department of Policy and Planning of MOA will implement the&#13;
monitoring component. Each agency will maintain separate project accounts and&#13;
progress reports and send them semi-annually to the Project Coordinator for&#13;
consolidation. Because of close linkages between this vrolect and the ASAL.&#13;
there will be cross-effectiveness conditions between the two operations&#13;
(para. 6.2).&#13;

for the supply of goods procured under international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the&#13;
CIF price or the prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers,&#13;
whichever is less, provided the value added to the product in Jordan exceeds&#13;
20 percent of the ex-factory bid price.&#13;

TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
4.5    Goods and equipment to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds would&#13;
consist of vehicles, laboratory and water-related equipment, office equipment&#13;
and furniture, agricultural tools and communication equipment. As far as&#13;
practicable, these would be packaged in such a manner that all packages would&#13;
be large enough to attract international competition. Goods and equipment&#13;
packages, including vehicles, estimated to cost more than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent each, would be procured through ICB, using the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents. International Shopping (IS), with at least three&#13;
quotations solicited from three eligible countries, would be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 with an aggregate limit of&#13;
US$0.3 million. Small value, off-the-shelf, items whose value would not&#13;
exceed $50,000 per contract, would be procured through Local Shopping (LS) by&#13;
obtaining at least three competitive quotations, with an aggregate limit of&#13;
US$0.2 million.&#13;
4.6    Contracts for technical assistance, consultants, and training would be&#13;
awarded following the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). There&#13;
will be a total of about 7 staff-months of assignments ranging from one staff&#13;
month to two staff months. There will also be a total of 39 staff-months of&#13;
training overseas and 36 staff months of local training.&#13;
4.7    The implementing agencies have staff who are conversant with&#13;
international commercial procurement practices and the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures. To ensure compliance with the Bank's procurement guidelines, all&#13;
contracts awarded through ICB, as well as all contracts for technical&#13;
assistance and consultants services, would be subject to prior Bank review.&#13;
These limits would result in prior review of over 90% of procurement financed&#13;
by the Bank. All other contracts would be subject to selective ex-post review&#13;
by the Bank. During necaotiations. assurances were obtained that the&#13;
Government would undertake Drocurement of cqoods and services in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, and also standard bidding documents&#13;
for ICB and consultant services, as well as the format and content of the bid&#13;
evaluation reDorts. were acireed with the Borrower (Dara. 6.1 (c)).&#13;
4.8    Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a) Prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower.&#13;
(b) Comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank by the Borrower&#13;
indicating:&#13;
(i) Revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the&#13;
total project, including best estimates of allowances for&#13;
physical and price contingencies;&#13;
(ii) Revised timing of procurement actions, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time&#13;
for individual contracts; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
(iii) Compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of&#13;
procurement.&#13;
C.   Disbursement&#13;
4.9    The proposed Bank loan of US$6.60 million would be disbursed over four&#13;
and the half years against the categories and disbursement percentages&#13;
summarized in Schedule B. Disbursement would be made against full&#13;
documentation, except for payment against contracts of less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, which would be reimbursed against statements of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). Documentation for the SOEs would be kept by the respective&#13;
implementing agencies for audit, and for review by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
4.10   SRecial Account.  To facilitate project implementation and&#13;
disbursement against eligible expenditures, the Government has agreed to&#13;
establish a Special Account in the Central Bank of Jordan which would be&#13;
operated under terms and conditions satisfactory to the World Bank (IBRD).&#13;
The special account will have an authorized allocation of US$500,000 and will&#13;
be periodically replenished on the basis of withdrawal applications, which&#13;
should be supported by appropriate documentation.&#13;
D.   Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.11   The project coordinator (para. 4.1) will coordinate and consolidate&#13;
the separate project accounts of the MWI (JVA, WAJ), and the MOA (NCARTT,&#13;
DOEI, Department of Policy and Planning). The project coordinator would&#13;
coordinate preparation of annual consolidated accounts. An independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank would: (a) audit the consolidated project&#13;
accounts, as well as the special accounts, in accordance with generally&#13;
accepted auditing practices; and (b) complete the audit and submit the report&#13;
in a timely manner. The reDort and two coDies of the audited accounts would&#13;
be sent to the Bank by the proiect coordinator no later than six months after&#13;
the end of the fiscal Year. Assurances on these procedures were given durina&#13;
negotiations (para. 6.1 (c)).&#13;
E.   SuRervision&#13;
4.12   During early implementation, Bank supervision should be intensive to&#13;
ensure that project activities get off to a good start. In the first year,&#13;
three supervision missions will be planned (20 staff weeks), followed by&#13;
supervisions every six months for the remaining three years (7 staff weeks per&#13;
supervision mission). The supervision missions will concentrate on: (a)&#13;
progress on individual components, targets and schedules with respect to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
achieving stated objectives; (b) implementation problems; and (c) impacts. A&#13;
Mid-Term Review (MTR) would be carried out by the end of the second year of&#13;
the project to assess overall progress on project components, and to address&#13;
major issues relating to project design and implementation. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were given at negotiations (Para 6.1 (b)).&#13;
F. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.13   Overall, the anticipated impacts of the project on the environment&#13;
would be positive because it would help to reverse the trend of mining of&#13;
groundwater resources and to control salinity levels, thereby ensuring&#13;
sustainable water availability and use. By encouraging reduction in the use&#13;
of pesticides and improving awareness of techniques of integrated pest&#13;
management, the project is expected to reduce the incidence of toxins in food&#13;
(e.g., fruits, vegetables and meat) and in the environment, and thereby help&#13;
to improve public health and the quality of the environment. Overall, the&#13;
project is expected to have no adverse effects on the environment, and it is&#13;
ranked Environmental Assessment Category "C" in accordance with OD 4.01.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1    The main benefit of the project would be to facilitate the timely&#13;
implementation of proposed policy reforms in water and agriculture to bring&#13;
about more economical use of water and other agricultural resources. By&#13;
improving control and management of water resources, the project would improve&#13;
water distribution and use. Those farmers who adjust would be induced to&#13;
shift to higher value, water-efficient cropping systems oriented towards&#13;
exports. Strategic investments in research and extension would over time raise&#13;
farm productivity and incomes, reduce produce loss and improve product quality&#13;
and prices. Under the project, poor farmers, who are unlikely to attract&#13;
private extension services, would particularly benefit from targeted&#13;
agricultural research and extension interventions.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.2    The major risks of the project would be: (a) resistance by well-owners&#13;
to water metering and deliberate damage of water metering devices; and (b)&#13;
flight of trained personnel which may undermine institutional investments in&#13;
research and extension. On risk (a), JVA and WAJ will conduct user awareness&#13;
campaigns through the mass media and will combine tightened enforcement of&#13;
regulations with a program to improve service to users. On risk (b), it is&#13;
expected that better setting of institutional objectives and improvements in&#13;
management should provide more job satisfaction. Specific incentives -&#13;
promotion, access to training or better facilities - will also help improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
motivation.   For research, steps are underway to provide NCARTT with the&#13;
administrative and financial autonomy to set salary scales and benefits at&#13;
levels competitive with those for university staff. Overall, it may be&#13;
necessary to require staff to sign a contract to stay for a stipulated minimum&#13;
period after training.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
6.1    The following assurances were given by the Government during&#13;
negotiations, that it will:&#13;
(a) assign to the Project Coordinator the responsibilities for the&#13;
coordination of project implementation (para 4.1);&#13;
(b) carry out a mid-term review by the end of the second year of&#13;
implementation to assess project progress based on agreed terms of&#13;
reference (para. 4.12; Appendix 7);&#13;
(c) undertake procurement of goods and services in accordance with&#13;
Bank Guidelines; maintain project accounts to be audited by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank; and submit to the Bank&#13;
yearly audit reports and audited accounts no later than six months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year (paras. 4.3-4.8; 4.10);&#13;
(d) internationally recruit an experienced management specialist to&#13;
assist NCARTT by June 30, 1995 (para 3.10).&#13;
6.2    The ASAL and the ASTSUP are required to become effective&#13;
simultaneously.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROJECT (ASTSUP)&#13;
NCARTT RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Objective: Having faced difficulties in attracting and retaining the&#13;
qualified staff it requires to carry out its mandate, NCARTT's&#13;
research capability and output has seriously eroded. The&#13;
objective of the present assignment is, to assist NCARTT in&#13;
implementing its long-term strategy which it prepared with&#13;
assistance of ICARDA/ISNAR and USAID.&#13;
The task of the expert will be to assist NCARTT Management and&#13;
provide guidance to its research staff, in implementing the&#13;
strategy and re-organizing work planning and strengthening&#13;
budgetting procedures within the Institution.&#13;
Specifically, research would have to become demand-driven and&#13;
focussed on priority areas and target groups not covered by the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
Research and extension would work closely together in identifying&#13;
target groups, their socio-economic characteristics, and a&#13;
holistic approach would be adopted, both in the identification of&#13;
research-worthy problems, as also in the formulation and&#13;
dissemination of recommendations.&#13;
Duties:    The Research Management Specialist will assist the Director of&#13;
NCARTT and researchers in implementing the strategy; in providing&#13;
guidance, reorienting and motivating staff in the directions&#13;
indicated above; in research planning, budgetting and program&#13;
design; in reactivating the RASC field station network; and in&#13;
strengthening research-extension linkages. Specifically, duties&#13;
will be to:&#13;
- outline an approach and priority action program for&#13;
implementing the national agricultural research strategy;&#13;

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
AGRICULTURE SECTOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROJECT (ASTSUP)&#13;
MID-TERM REVIEW&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.    Background and Introduction&#13;
1.    A mid-term review of all project activities would be carried out&#13;
jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture (NCARTT, DOEI), the Ministry of Water&#13;
and Irrigation (JVA, WAJ), the Ministry of Planning, the Bank and other&#13;
cofinanciers (GTZ, KfW). The review would be held in Amman by the end of the&#13;
second year of project implementation, and the project coordinator is expected&#13;
to participate.&#13;
B.    Obiectives of Review&#13;
2.    The objective of the review would be to assess project progress based&#13;
on the agreed target indicators, stipulated in Schedule 1, and to recommend&#13;
solutions to problems which may have arisen during implementation.&#13;
C.    Scope of Work&#13;
3.    To facilitate the review, the project coordinator, with inputs from the&#13;
implementing agencies and with assistance, if required, from consultants,&#13;
would prepare a detailed consolidated report of project performance for the&#13;
one and the half years of implementation. This report would be sent to the&#13;
Bank no later than September 30, 1996.&#13;
4.    The Bank review mission, together with participation from the German&#13;
cofinanciers of the project, would visit Amman and discuss the progress of&#13;
components with individual implementing agencies. It would evaluate and&#13;
assess the implementation progress with respect to achieving agreed physical&#13;
targets. This would involve assessing physical achievements, such as the&#13;
number of farm turnouts rehabilitated in the concerned project area and the&#13;
water control devices installed, the number of wells in the Highlands&#13;
installed with flow meters, and the number of groundwater monitoring equipment&#13;
purchased. The review mission would undertake field visits to the project&#13;
area to participate in random test checks of physical achievements on the&#13;
ground. Technical assistance programs would be assessed in terms of feedbacks&#13;
from the benefitting Ministry, and training programs in terms of the number of&#13;
people trained. The mission would also assess the need for redesign and/or&#13;
restructuring of project components with imple mntation difficulties,&#13;
including as necessary drafting an action plan to be carried out until&#13;
completion.&#13;
5.    The mission would prepare an aide-memoire with recommendations to be&#13;
discussed with Government representatives at a wrap-up meeting at the end of&#13;
the review.&#13;

THE ASTAP PROGRAM&#13;
1.       The Agriculture Sector Technical Assistance Program (ASTAP) was&#13;
requested by Government at the start of the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(ASAL) dialogue in 1992 to provide support to ASAL implementation and to&#13;
provide assistance to farmers in managing changes during the adjustment&#13;
period. Government asked for Bank help to organize project preparation and to&#13;
mobilize and coordinate financing, with an objective of maximizing grant&#13;
financing. The Bank was to have a minority share in financing, and Bank loan&#13;
funds were to be directed primarily to "hardware."  Technical assistance would&#13;
be financed primarily by grant funds.&#13;
2.       Over the last two years, the Bank has worked closely with Government&#13;
and donors on preparation and on the financing plan. The FAO/CP prepared the&#13;
ASTAP in 1993 under Government and Bank supervision. The Bank has cooperated&#13;
with Government in coordinating multi-donor grant funding (USAID, GTZ, French&#13;
Aid, KfW). The broad ASTAP program has total funding of about $25.51 million,&#13;
including support for integrated pest management, horticulture development,&#13;
and development of the Ministry of Agriculture. Within this multi-donor&#13;
program is a core project called the Agriculture Sector Technical Support&#13;
Project (ASTSUP), which would be financed by the Bank, GTZ, and KfW. ASTSUP&#13;
is a $13.31 million project (Bank $6.60 million, GTZ $2.20 million, KfW $3.08&#13;
million and Government 1.43 million).&#13;
3.       The ASTAP framework comprises the support project, ASTSUP, and&#13;
components that are financed as free-standing projects by other donors and&#13;
which will not be supervised by the Bank. There is an advantage in having an&#13;
ASTAP program because it provides a framework for coordinating implementation,&#13;
exchanging information, and avoiding overlap. It allows Government and the&#13;
Bank to demonstrate to farmers and the population at large that adjustment&#13;
comes accompanied by a good deal of implementation support. It also&#13;
highlights the components that are not yet financed and should help the search&#13;
for suitable donors. In short, the matching of ASAL reforms with ASTAP&#13;
technical support is a visible sign of Government's commitment to supporting&#13;
producers during the transition. Designed to improve the efficiency of&#13;
response, ASTAP will help to improve benefits and mitigate adverse effects&#13;
and, hence, reduce political risks to the program.&#13;
4.       The ASTAP framework comprises a number of donor-financed projects&#13;
designed to support the ASAL and to alleviate the major constraints to the&#13;
development of sustainable agriculture: water, producer services, and markets&#13;
(para. 1.3, Technical Annex).   There is the Bank and German financing of the&#13;
water comDonents in the ASTSUP. In addition, under ASTAP, GTZ is providing&#13;
bilateral support for a project of about US$1.75 million to improve water&#13;
quality through training and studies. For Droducer services, in addition to&#13;
the research and extension components in ASTSUP, GTZ would be providing&#13;
bilateral support for a project on integrated pest management (IPM).&#13;
Appraisal for the project is underway. The project, estimated at US$1.75&#13;
million, would build on a GTZ study on biological control of the white fly and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
APPENDIX 11&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
would use the existing facilities of the pesticide formulation and residue&#13;
control laboratories in Baqa, near Amman. Similarly, bilateral support of&#13;
about US$1.0 million is being provided by the French in the development of&#13;
horticultural crops (apple and flower growers). Overall, under ASTAP, there&#13;
is also broad-based support for institutional development in the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture presently being sponsored by USAID and GTZ. This is expected to&#13;
improve MOA's performance, particularly with respect to services to farmers.&#13;
5.       On market develotment, recognizing the smallness of the domestic&#13;
market and the need for an outward-looking agricultural sector in order to&#13;
increase value added, Government and the private sector have been making&#13;
considerable effort to develop the agricultural export sector and, in&#13;
particular, to overcome the historical problems (para. 1.5, Technical Annex).&#13;
6.       In the public sector, Government has taken an active role in market&#13;
development, setting up two parastatal entities, the Agricultural Marketing&#13;
Organization (AMO) and the Agricultural Marketing and Processing Company&#13;
(AMPCO). AMO was established in 1987 as a semi-independent entity under the&#13;
MOA to formulate agricultural marketing policies and public development of&#13;
both domestic and export markets. AMO's major activities include studies,&#13;
establishing a market information service and training. It has had very&#13;
little success in providing practical assistance to farmers and exporters.&#13;
Growers and exporters tend to place little trust in it; perhaps because it is&#13;
a Government organization which has done little to achieve its mandate.&#13;
7.       AMPCO's original mandate was to serve as catalyst for private sector&#13;
market development, but it has become extensively involved in trade on its own&#13;
account. It was established in 1983 as a public stock company, with the&#13;
Jordan Investment Organization owning 82.5% of the shares and the rest owned&#13;
by the Social Security Corporation (12.5%) and Agricultural Credit Corporation&#13;
(5). AMPCO owns and operates three produce packing stations, one tomato and&#13;
citrus processing plant, one large cold store, and various other plants. It&#13;
also exports fresh produce. During periods of shortage, AMPCO imports apples,&#13;
potatoes, and onions under a government monopoly agreement, and is required by&#13;
the Government to purchase tomatoes for processing at support prices.&#13;
S.       In the private sector, there has been some efforts to promote&#13;
agricultural exports. These efforts are, however, not well organized and are&#13;
too diffused to achieve the concentrated discipline and organization necessary&#13;
to break into the demanding markets of Europe. There is therefore scope for&#13;
improving cooperation in the agricultural marketing efforts of the private&#13;
sector to improve coordination in identification of market needs and&#13;
negotiation of contracts, production and quality certification, post-harvest&#13;
handling and pre-cooling of produce, transportation and timely delivery.&#13;
9.       Through the Government's adjustment program, supported under ASAL,&#13;
price distortions would be eliminated and a favorable incentive environment&#13;
would be created for production and marketing by removing import controls,&#13;
including AMPCO's monopoly. AMPCO would be privatized. Substantial&#13;
adaptation to the new environment is expected from farmers in the form of&#13;
shifts in the composition of their produce to better quality, higher value&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
APPENDIX 11&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
produce as they exploit new market opportunities. These shifts would require&#13;
more dynamic efforts to promote agricultural export sales. Successful&#13;
penetration of the European market will require pooling of resources in order&#13;
to achieve sufficient concentration of effort to break into this exacting&#13;
market. Under ASTAP, GTZ would be providing support initially of about&#13;
US$1.45 for horticultural market development. Appraisal for this project is&#13;
underway. This project would be implemented in cooperation with the existing&#13;
public institution, AMO. Technical assistance would be provided to inject&#13;
principles and methods into AMO to promote private sector export sales. GTZ&#13;
would also provide further support to horticultural export market development&#13;
by improving metrology, standardization, testing and quality control of&#13;
produce.&#13;
10.      The end of this note (Appendix 11)  presents all components of the&#13;
ASTAP program, the costs breakdown and the financiers. Appendix 12 presents&#13;
the linkages between the ASAL reform agenda and the supporting interventions&#13;
under ASTAP. The paragraphs below present those unfinanced components of&#13;
ASTAP which may be eligible for possible donor financing.&#13;
Components for Possible Donor Financing:&#13;
11.      Rural Finance.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) was founded&#13;
in 1960, and operates 15 branches, with a highly qualified staff of 255, of&#13;
whom half are located in the branches. It is managed by a Board of Directors&#13;
chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and comprising the Ministers of&#13;
Planning and Finance as ex-officio members, the Director General of ACC and&#13;
five private sector individuals. ACC is the main institutional source of&#13;
ymedium- and long-term credit for agriculture in Jordan. Of the total credit&#13;
to agriculture, ACC provides 50%, and its lending has been growing fast.&#13;
Between 1989 to 1992, ACC lending grew from JD 5 million to JD 23 million.&#13;
12.      There is strong unmet demand for credit for on-farm development and&#13;
for farm-related enterprises such as agro-processing and non-farm rural&#13;
enterprises. The financial market provides little term investment credit and&#13;
has little outreach in rural areas. There is scope, therefore, for an&#13;
institution like ACC. ACC, however, has weak management. It also suffers&#13;
from financial indiscipline and poor accounting practices. In the past it&#13;
received foreign loans at seemingly concessional terms but which proved more&#13;
expensive than local funds at market rates. ACC also has access to cheap&#13;
funds from the Government. Overall, ACC borrows at an average cost of funds&#13;
of 2% compared with an average market cost of funds of 5.2% and lends at 6-8B&#13;
(compared with an average market lending rate of 10.9%). These Government&#13;
subsidies have made it subject to Government directives, and officially&#13;
directed debt forgiveness has eroded credit discipline. ACC has, however, in&#13;
the past three years imposed tighter credit management. The recovery rate&#13;
rose to 73% in 1993. ACC could be made more financially viable if it is given&#13;
greater exposure to the market and granted greater autonomy from Government&#13;
interference. This would enable ACC to mobilize deposits in the market, as&#13;
permitted by its charter; diversify its lending by spreading its risks over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the whole spectrum of rural enterprises; and be under the supervision of the&#13;
Central Bank of Jordan.&#13;
13.      As part of Government's adjustment program supported under the ASAL,&#13;
Government is to adopt a policy affirming the financial and management&#13;
autonomy of ACC. Under the policy, ACC would cover the full range of rural&#13;
activities, and have the freedom to adjust its interest rates to cover its&#13;
costs. ACC will be supervised by the Central Bank, with the ultimate&#13;
objective of transformation into a full-fledged bank. ASTAP proposes five&#13;
studies for support of ACC's institutional development: (i) a diagnostic&#13;
audit to determine the quality and performance of the loan portfolio in&#13;
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards for banks; (ii) an&#13;
organization and management study to assess the strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
the present management and organization system and to propose modifications;&#13;
(iii) development of a five-year business plan to define objectives and&#13;
targets for development of the lending program (including sources and uses of&#13;
funds, and the plan to mobilize deposits); (iv) a rural financial market study&#13;
to expand the data base, including such issues as credit demand and savings&#13;
behavior among rural households; and (v) a technical study of agricultural&#13;
insurance to determine insurable risks, crops, activities and areas.&#13;
14.      CooDeratives. There are 236 agricultural primary cooperatives in&#13;
Jordan, with a total membership of 18,413. Together with other primary&#13;
cooperatives, they form the cooperative movement. These primary societies&#13;
operate under the supervision of the Jordan Cooperative Organization (JCO),&#13;
the apex organization for all cooperatives, which undertakes regulatory,&#13;
developmental, financial and commercial roles. JCO was established in 1971,&#13;
and it has become a tool through which Government intervenes in the business&#13;
operations of primary societies. Government has entrusted JCO with the&#13;
function of a registrar of cooperatives, and with the mandate to carry out&#13;
various rural development programs. As a result, the autonomy of cooperatives&#13;
has been lost, and many cooperatives are in financial difficulty. Members&#13;
have come to regard cooperatives as source of subsidized goods and services&#13;
and not as member-serving, profit-making ventures.&#13;
15.      JCO has failed as an apex because it combines the incompatible roles&#13;
of providing subsidized services while pursuing goals of improved efficiency&#13;
and profitability. In addition there has been financial indiscipline, and JCO&#13;
is almost bankrupt. It has accumulated deficits of JD 5.7 million. The JCO&#13;
Cooperative Bank is also bankrupt. It has total loans and receivables of JD&#13;
26.7 million, most of which are non-performing. Part of this lending (JD 11&#13;
million) was financed by deposits generated from the public on which the&#13;
Cooperative Bank has ceased payment.&#13;
16.       The cooperative movement in Jordan is in crisis.  Government is keen&#13;
to take action to solve the crisis. Historically, rural cooperatives played a&#13;
useful role in providing services to farmers, particularly to small farmers,&#13;
and they could play a growing role in marketing and input supply as Jordanian&#13;
agriculture further intensifies and adopts a growing outward orientation.&#13;
&#13;

Saving the movement would require a thorough overhaul based on basic&#13;
principles so that: (i) members are once again sovereign, and management and&#13;
staff are accountable to members; (ii) the top-down apex structure is phased&#13;
out and emphasis is given to strengthening primary societies, and to&#13;
encouraging their coming together in a federated or union structure; and (iii)&#13;
societies have autonomy as private sector enterprises free from governmental&#13;
interventions. This restructuring requires the drafting of appropriate&#13;
legislation to clarify which functions of the JCO should reside with&#13;
Government and which should be managed by the cooperative movement.&#13;
17.      Under the adjustment program, supported by the ASAL, Government is&#13;
proposing the development of a policy statement and a program of restructuring&#13;
to separate regulatory and implementation functions and lay the basis to&#13;
revive a bottom-up cooperative movement. The ASTAP will support the reform&#13;
efforts by proposing for financing   (i) a study to develop new cooperative&#13;
legislation. This would provide for the creation of a small Governmental&#13;
regulatory body, the Jordan Cooperative Authority (JCA), under the Office of&#13;
the Prime Minister. The study would also develop a Cooperative Code to&#13;
provide clear guidelines on the legal roles of cooperatives and their&#13;
responsibilities to their members, management, the Government and third&#13;
parties; (ii) a study, including a detailed financial audit, which would lead&#13;
to the winding up of JCO and its functions; and (iii) a study that would&#13;
formulate strategies for developing primary societies into federated&#13;
structures.&#13;
is.      Rangelands and Livestock DeveloDment.  Livestock development in&#13;
Jordan is limited by the declining quality of rangeland resources and the&#13;
ambiguity about user rights over particular areas. Declining rangeland&#13;
condition is a major problem, and as a result of the significant increases in&#13;
livestock numbers, the contribution of rangelands in feeding the national herd&#13;
over the past two decades has declined from 85t to 40%. Average range&#13;
productivity is low, estimated at 50kg DM/ha per year. This decline is due&#13;
to: (i) conversion of higher potential rangelands to marginal barley&#13;
production encouraged by subsidized barley prices; (ii) overstocking because&#13;
of subsidized feed; and (iii) population encroachment on rangelands to extract&#13;
trees and shrubs for firewood. Overstocking is a special problem requiring&#13;
attention. In the past decade, the small ruminant stock has more than doubled&#13;
from 1.6 million to 3.75 million.  Most of these are kept by medium scale,&#13;
sometimes landless farmers, in the Highlands and foothills of northern Jordan,&#13;
and in the drier rangelands (the Badia) by nomadic tribes. Many of these&#13;
ruminants depend on subsidized feed, but are let loose on the rangeland for&#13;
several months a year. For cattle, the 1991 census data indicated that numbers&#13;
have doubled from 28,000 (of which 20,000 are native Baladi and crosses; the&#13;
remainder Friesian or Holstein cattle) to 64,000 (of which 12,000 are Baladi).&#13;
Because of declining range quality and the increasing scarcity of quality&#13;
grazing land, most farmers feed their animals with grain and concentrate,&#13;
supplemented with roughage, such as straw, alfalfa, hay and crop residues,&#13;
ahich are usually scarce and expensive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

APPENDIX 11&#13;

19.      Land ownership and user rights are also a problem.  Most of the&#13;
steppe and Badia rangelands were traditionally owned by tribes, but are now by&#13;
law owned by the Government. The Bedouin do have traditional land rights, and&#13;
this was strengthened in the early 1980s when the Government recognized these&#13;
rights. user rights are, however, not well defined and controlled. The&#13;
development of a land use plan would help to reduce the potential for conflict&#13;
and provide a basis for improved range management.&#13;
20.      Given Jordan's deteriorating rangelands and the lack of other feed&#13;
resources, there is need to manage resources and animal stocks to bring them&#13;
in balance with each other and to ensure resource sustainability. The removal&#13;
of feed subsidies, part of the Government's adjustment program under ASAL,&#13;
should improve use of feed and fodder resources and, in the long term, reduce&#13;
the degradation of rangelands arising from overstocking and overgrazing. The&#13;
removal of cereal producer subsidies would reduce further conversion of&#13;
rangelands for unsustainable grain production. However, presently, there is&#13;
no solid baseline data to give an indication of the condition of rangelands in&#13;
Jordan. Under the program, it therefore, proposed for financing: (i) a&#13;
rangeland studv (using satellite imagery, GIS and vegetational analysis of&#13;
sample plots for calibration), which would provide a country-wide empirical&#13;
assessment of the extent and rate of rangeland degradation that has been&#13;
associated with producer and stockfeed subsidies, and of its environmental and&#13;
ecological implications; (ii) a study to review and, if appropriate, propose&#13;
amendments to existing legislation on land use and ownership, with the&#13;
possibility of transferring ownership or custody to identified range user&#13;
(tribal) groups.   It is understood that this study on land use and ownership&#13;
is presently underway with USAID funding; and (iii) a socio-economic study to&#13;
identify the special tribal groups and range users found in the Eastern&#13;
rangelands, their socio-economic activities and aspirations, and propose&#13;
specific support programs and actions. It is recommended that selected staff&#13;
from DOEI, the Veterinary Services and the Rangelands Division of MOA should&#13;
participate to be further trained and to benefit from their prior experience&#13;
with working with those peoples. The Agricultural Policy Department of MOA&#13;
has agreed to submit to the Bank by May 31, 1994, the detailed terms of&#13;
reference and cost estimates for such a study. This study is a potential&#13;
candidate for financing under the Desertification Control Initiative.&#13;

two "hot spots" dealt with in the Letter of Sector Policy under ASAL, and&#13;
underlining the need for studies and a water quality monitoring program under&#13;
ASTAP.&#13;
Review of the Public Expenditure Program (PEP), two papers dealing with (1) water&#13;
and wastewater, and (2) agriculture. The papers analyse the Five-Year Plan&#13;
proposals and give indications of criteria for prioritizing project proposals.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation, which sets out the parameters for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the adjustment process under ASAL, including the impact on farmer&#13;
income, and defines the system for support under ASTAP.&#13;
Institutional Issues in the Ministry of Agriculture, which concentrates on the&#13;
objectives of the ministry and on the process of change and development that is&#13;
underway.&#13;
Agricultural Research, a paper that focusses on the main issues in research&#13;
development treated in the Letter of Sector Policy under ASAL, and on the project&#13;
proposals supported under ASTAP.&#13;
Agricultural Extension, which analyses the state of the extension service now&#13;
provided and identifies key development needs both for the Letter of Sector&#13;
Policy under ASAL and for technical assistance under ASTAP.&#13;
Rural Finance, analyzing the need for policy changes, to be included in the&#13;
Letter of Sector Policy under ASAL to help ACC fit in to the financial sector as&#13;
a market-based institution, and detailing studies and technical assistance for&#13;
ASTAP support.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Agriculture Sector
            Technical Support Project are to assist the Government in
            the implementation of agricultural policy adjustments and to
            improve services to farmers and livestock producers. The
            project will support the adjustment program through: a)
            water measurement and management in the Jordan Valley; b)
            groundwater basin monitoring and cotrol; c) strengthening
            research; d) developing extension; and e) carrying out
            monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the adjustment
            program. The first component will help improve water
            measurement and management in the Jordan Valley. Under the
            second component, the Government is adopting a program to
            move towards sustainable groundwater abstraction nationwide,
            and implementing a full management program to meter and
            control all groundwater production, supply and usage. Under
            the remaining components, the project will strengthen the
            key agricultural support services of research and extension
            to enable them to better advise producers on optimizing
            productivity in response to changing price signals during adjustment.
