 Box   Methodology for decomposing changes in vulnerability&#13;
1       Using an accounting identity to decompose changes in vulnerability over time allows the separation of the pure oil price change&#13;
        effect from other changes that can affect vulnerability. For the analysis described in this Note, the following identity is used:&#13;

        To analyze the change in vulnerability over a number of years, based on the identity, a log mean Divisia index (LMDI) is used. The              attributed to the World&#13;
        change in a country's vulnerability (D ) between any two years can be decomposed into the sum of the effects of the change in                   Bank or any other affiliated&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Oil prices more than tripled between
            January 2004 and March 2008. The effects can be hard on
            countries with large net oil imports relative to income.
            This note sets out a measure of vulnerability to oil price
            shocks and breaks it down into its components. That allows
            cross-country benchmarking and helps to show how changes in
            such factors as energy efficiency and the real exchange rate
            can make countries more vulnerable or less so.
