       By:   Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&amp;#12;Memorialist's name:     Mervyn L. Weiner&#13;
Date of Interview:     July 16, 1986&#13;
Interviewer's name:     Robert W. Oliver&#13;
Place: The World Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   This is Robert Oliver.       I am going to have a conversation with&#13;
Mr. Mervyn Weiner about his long and outstanding career in the World Bank.&#13;
Maybe we can begin by my asking if you would tell a bit about how you came&#13;
to the Bank in the first place and something about the major periods of your&#13;
experience in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   I came to the Bank at the age of 28.      This may seem like an odd&#13;
piece of information to begin with, but my first conversation with my then&#13;
first boss, who was a Frenchman, now sadly deceased, was for him to ask me,&#13;
"How old are you?"     I had been interviewed by some of his people but hadn't&#13;
met him before, and I told him.    His response led me to conclude that, in&#13;
his view, somebody had made a grave error in hiring someone so young,&#13;
inexperienced and green, all of which were true.       It certainly was alien to&#13;
his European experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   You were Canadian by birth, I think?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Yes, and I still am.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   And so I assume that you are bilingual; Canadians are supposed to&#13;
speak French?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Well, I should be more bilingual than most since I was born and&#13;
grew up in Montreal.    It was and I believe still is, after Paris, the&#13;
largest French-speaking city in the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   So you could address this French person in French?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                   -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     I can speak French, I can function in French, but it doesn't come&#13;
easily.     When I was growing up, the province wasn't as bilingual as it has&#13;
subsequently become.     The younger French Quebecois of the 1960s pushed for&#13;
more emphasis on French language and culture in the Anglophone community.&#13;
The province has since become bilingual in a way that it wasn't when I was&#13;
younger.     So that, yes, I can function in French; but I think we would be&#13;
better off if we were to continue in English.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     No, I was thinking about the relationship with this French person&#13;
who though that 28 was too young an age.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Anyway, maybe you'd tell how you became interested in the World Bank in&#13;
the first place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Well, I was just going to come to that.    I was backing into it.&#13;
I did my undergraduate studies at McGill.       I spent most of the next three&#13;
years overseas with the Canadian Army, from which I was discharged as a&#13;
captain in the artillery.    And then I spent two years after that in England,&#13;
as a graduate student at Oxford University.       I had the good fortune to be&#13;
there on a Rhodes Scholarship.       When I came back, I was faced with the&#13;
decision of whether or not to join the Canadian civil service.       I had&#13;
actually taken exams for entry into the Department of Finance.       The&#13;
alternative was to stay away for a little while longer, because five years&#13;
overseas in war-time England had made me a little restless to settle down&#13;
that way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    What emerged was a decision not to go to Ottawa, but rather to take a&#13;
teaching appointment at the Â·University of Pennsylvania, as an instructor in&#13;
economics.&#13;
                                 .&#13;
              And like so many things in life, small decisions lead to big&#13;
deviations in subsequent paths.       I spent that year at Penn, and the two&#13;
subsequent years as instructor and a graduate student at [Johns] Hopkins.&#13;
It was during this period that my readings, my interest, began to focus&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
increasingly on the development issues of the post-war world.     Why and how I&#13;
can't say; it was there, the same way that other people have interests&#13;
developing in quite different directions.     I remember writing a paper while&#13;
at Hopkins on the development of what was then fashionably called backward&#13;
countries--they're now called developing companies--for Fritz Machlup; who&#13;
died a few years ago.     This was very unusual at Hopkins because the students&#13;
who came there and the faculty that were there didn't elicit that kind of&#13;
interest, so I was an oddball in that regard.     I'm sure that it was not&#13;
because of the merits of the paper, but in response to my unusual interest--&#13;
unusual in that group--that Machlup introduced me to [Paul] Rosenstein-Rodin&#13;
who was then chief of the Bank's tiny Economic Advisory Staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It was that connection that led me to the World Bank, where I came for a&#13;
series of interviews.     I was to have worked with Rodin in what was then a&#13;
very small Bank.    But between the interviews and moving'to the Bank in June&#13;
of 1951, Rodin left and my first boss was this Frenchman, Leonard Rist.        So&#13;
that was the way I came to the Bank, by way of an academic introduction in&#13;
response to an evident interest in the subject matter of the World Bank,&#13;
although I knew nothing about the organization at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Were you aware, shortly after you came to the Bank, of the&#13;
differences of opinion between Rosenstein-Rodin on the one hand and Robert&#13;
Garner on the other hand about various issues but including projects versus&#13;
sort of program lending?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I'd been told about them, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    But you were not aware of them?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I was not aware of them when I came.   No,   all of this information&#13;
was acquired later.     As I got to know the Bank better and got to know&#13;
Mr. Garner a little bit, to the degree that one was able to as a very young,&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
very junior staff member, the fallout didn't surprise me.       In any event,&#13;
there I came.     I spent the next four years doing a variety of general&#13;
economic studies with this very small group, very good people, many of whom&#13;
stayed with the Bank for the remainder of their career as well.       Gerry&#13;
[Gerald] Alter, who later became my boss as Director, Western Hemisphere&#13;
Department, was one.     John Adler, the head of the unit, was another. He,&#13;
sadly, died some years ago, after being budget director for the Bank.         Ken&#13;
Bohr, whom you mentioned, was there.       The other member was Jean-Claude&#13;
Antoine, who subsequently returned to private activity in his native France.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     John de Wilde, was he there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Not in that unit.   He was in one of the Area departments, like&#13;
Andy.     The Bank was then organized very differently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I spent four years there and became restless towards the end of that&#13;
period.     In the middle 1950s I moved to the Latin America Area to become a&#13;
country economist.     I spent the next 15 years in the Latin American Region,&#13;
for about a half a dozen years as a country economist.      I spent two years&#13;
living in South America with small resident missions the Bank had, one in&#13;
Lima, Peru and the other in Quito, Ecuador.      Then I became successively a&#13;
loan officer for Mexico, chief of the division that dealt with operations in&#13;
Mexico and three other countries, and economic adviser, later renamed chief&#13;
economist, for the Latin American Region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    That was at the same time that Gerry Alter became Director?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Gerry had become Director before, because he was the one who&#13;
invited me to become chief economist, how long before I don't recall at the&#13;
moment.    He was already the Director when I made that change.    It was at his&#13;
invitation.     So my period in Latin America, which covered economic work and&#13;
operations work at the micro level and at the managerial level, began in&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
1954.    It ended in 1969, the year after McNamara came to the Bank.   That was&#13;
when, in response to initiatives of mine for a change of the type of work I&#13;
was doing, I was asked to become the projects director for the Public&#13;
Utilities Projects Department, following David Knox, who had just moved to&#13;
replace Warren Baum in the Transport Projects Department, when Warren moved&#13;
up to the front office for the projects group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That began a particularly interesting and happy period.     They were all&#13;
happy periods, in varying degrees.    The whole 33 years was a happy period.&#13;
I feel very, very fortunate to be able to say that.    But that period was&#13;
especially stimulating because it threw me into contact with people whom I&#13;
respected for their professional backgrounds in areas that I had no&#13;
background in, and the complementary relationship that we developed was one&#13;
that I valued highly.   My colleagues also appreciated not being second-&#13;
guessed by their boss on the technical judgments for which they had been&#13;
hired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That assignment lasted until the Bank was reorganized in 1972, when the&#13;
projects group was broken up and spread among five regions.     I became&#13;
projects director for all sectors for the Asia Region.     The Asia Region was&#13;
broken up some two years later into East Asia and Pacific, and South Asia.&#13;
I became Vice President for South Asia.    Just a little less than two years&#13;
after that I accepted the invitation from Robert McNamara to become the&#13;
Bank's first Director General for Operations Evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now there's a history there that we can touch as a separate subject when&#13;
we come to Operations Evaluation.    That was my last assignment in the Bank.&#13;
That office was set up constitutionally so that the only place to go after&#13;
that was out.   I would have stayed there until I had completed my second&#13;
term, which would have been a little short of my normal retirement, but when&#13;
the Bank's first early retirement program was offered by Tom [Alden W.]&#13;
Clausen, the difference in time between departing under that program and&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
when I said I would otherwise was only 15 months, so when he, as Chairman of&#13;
the Board, assured me that I did not have a moral obligation to stay for the&#13;
full second term, which was my original posture, I decided to take advantage&#13;
of the goodies in that early retirement program.       And that brings us here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, it's a marvelous career.    Shall we go back and ask if you can&#13;
say a bit about highlights of these individual parts.      As you were operating&#13;
as an economist in the post-Rosenstein-Rodin era but still in general&#13;
economics, are there events that stand out in your memory?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Those first years were for me of course interesting because it was&#13;
my first serious work experience.     Except for a summer as an economist at&#13;
the United Nations, in the summer of 1948, my life to that time had been&#13;
spent in academia.     This was a major change.   I learned about the Bank.&#13;
I became aware that the gulf between general economic studies and the rest&#13;
of the Bank was enormous, but I only became aware of how broad that gulf was&#13;
as I got to know the Bank better.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Why?     Well, that gulf was in part an inevitable expression of the sense&#13;
of distance and tension between people who are operationally oriented and&#13;
who are involved in the nitty-gritty of doing things with the clients of the&#13;
organization, and people who are removed from that interface with the client&#13;
and are engaged in exercises of analysis and reflection, the relevance of&#13;
which may not always be appreciated by the daily operator.      That was true&#13;
then, and that perception was reinforced as I moved to the other side of&#13;
that divide a few years later.     I suspect that until recent years it has&#13;
persisted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The research function has grown, has become professional in ways that it&#13;
was never even dreamed of at .that time, not only in scale and in scope but&#13;
in substance, and merits respect.     At that time it was not that kind of&#13;
work, but more a service unit to the organization.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                    -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Do you mean to imply that operational people paid no attention, or&#13;
very little attention, to        whatever economic reports were being turned out&#13;
or to general economics research?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Yes.     They paid no attention to it.   Not always because they were&#13;
small-minded, but because often they saw no relationship between the subject&#13;
matter of these reports and the work that they were doing.         One of the&#13;
interesting evolutions of the Bank in recent years has been the very&#13;
deliberate effort to make the Bank's economic work more operationally&#13;
relevant than it used to be in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now we can talk about that because the Bank's economic work has two&#13;
dimensions:        one is research, the other is operational economics--country&#13;
and sector studies, and the microeconomic analysis of projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The link between country economic work and Bank operations shows the&#13;
most interesting evolution.        As far as research and Bank operations, there&#13;
has been a pereistant distance that may have even increased as the&#13;
sophistication of the Bank's research has increased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understood you to say earlier that you thought in recent years&#13;
the economics work had become more operationally oriented again?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Yes.      That's correct, if we refer to country and sector economic&#13;
work.     Effective operational integration has become most dramatic between&#13;
the country economic and sector work and lending operations.-        Some would say&#13;
it has really become integrated only since the development of structural&#13;
adjustment lending--SAL--for.which the country economic work has become the&#13;
foundation.        There are aspects of the operational work in Latin America in&#13;
the 1960s--policy-based lending--which are not very different from what is&#13;
often described as new today, although it was not representative of the&#13;
larger Bank at the time.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER)&#13;
    As for research, the program has become rich and broad and deep, and the&#13;
Bank is stronger for it; but it remains largely apart: it has an audience as&#13;
much outside the Bank as inside, unlike the rest of the work, which is more&#13;
operational, and is also bureaucratically distant in organizational location&#13;
and control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, in that sense the more academic economic work that is not&#13;
related to country analysis going on at the Bank today is not unlike the&#13;
general economics work in which you were engaged during your first four&#13;
years in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Correct.   Except it's much better now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Much, much bigger, of course, dealing with many, many more issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    But there is still a dichotomy between economics, hyphen, academic&#13;
work on the one hand and the operational economic work on the other hand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    That's correct.   And it was that distance,   which I experienced in&#13;
the early fifties, which can still be observed to some degree today.      That's&#13;
correct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, how about in the 15-year period when you were working on&#13;
Latin America.    There must be some interesting stories that you can tell&#13;
about that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Life was varied and interesting.   Colleagues were top quality and&#13;
stimulating, and I came to know people who are running some of the Bank's&#13;
largest client governments today.     But the point I would stress for this&#13;
oral history has to do with what we've just been talking about: the nature&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
of the operational relationship with member countries, and the relationship&#13;
of country economic work to operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Gerry Alter, first as economic adviser for the Department of Operations,&#13;
Western Hemisphere and then as Director of the Western Hemisphere&#13;
Department, later called the South America Department, was a major&#13;
innovator.    He endeavored to do what has in recent years become general Bank&#13;
policy, to integrate the operational programs--that is, the programs of&#13;
projects for which the Bank offered financing to countries--and the&#13;
understandings with the countries about the policy context of these&#13;
operations.    He wanted these understandings to become an expression of the&#13;
Bank's analysis of what's right and what's wrong with those countries, and&#13;
where and how the Bank can best help them address some of their most urgent&#13;
problems.     I have had occasion to remind people that this integration, which&#13;
today is much talked about and regarded with great enthusiasm--or with great&#13;
concern depending on whom one speaks to--is not as new as some of the&#13;
younger people seem to think.    Certainly, the experience that we had then&#13;
and sought to have contradicts those who refer to the Bank as just a project&#13;
lender, no interest beyond the separate projects in its loan portfolio.&#13;
Nothing could have been further from the truth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In the 1960s we in the Latin America Region financed sector programs.&#13;
We sought, as conditions for these sector investment programs, to make&#13;
corrections in both institutions and policy in the sector.     To illustrate:&#13;
the largest client at the time was the national power system in Mexico.     The&#13;
largest loans the Bank made at that time, each well in excess of $100&#13;
million--which in the early 1960s was a lot--were bi-annual loans to finance&#13;
time slices of the power development program in Mexico.    The issues debated&#13;
in preparation for these loans were sector policy issues of the most&#13;
fundamental kind:    sector finances, sector tariffs, and engineering issues&#13;
having to do with the national integration of separate systems.     This&#13;
reguired frequency unification, for which special investments were needed,&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
as well as complicated integration of institutions with different legal&#13;
structures, labor unions, and staff.     The Bank was than up to its ears in&#13;
sector lending, of a type which is now more general in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you also pay attention to the interrelationship between sectors&#13;
or amongst sectors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     The answer is, of course, yes.   Country economic work had as its&#13;
typical format the review of the investment programs of the whole public&#13;
sector, with sector analyses done in parallel in some of the major missions&#13;
that we had.     I'll use Mexico again as an illustration.   We would engage the&#13;
Government in often very stressful discussions about the coherence of its&#13;
programs: the content of the separate sector programs, the relationship&#13;
between sector programs, and the relationship of the consolidated progress&#13;
to the public finances of the country as a whole.      One of the typical&#13;
products of that type of exercise was the joint development--together with a&#13;
country--of a consolidated public sector investment financing program.&#13;
The technical analyses underpinning recommendations about the investment&#13;
programs for each sector were added together to underpin recommendations&#13;
about financing for all the sectors taken together; that led into the larger&#13;
macroanalysis for the country.     That was how we thought of country economic&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Was it primarily, though, in Latin America or was it across the&#13;
Bank?     Was it in Asia?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Well, here I am not well placed to offer comparative comment.     That&#13;
was common in Latin America.     I'm told by people who say they knew the rest&#13;
of the Bank at that time that it was less common in other parts of the Bank.&#13;
I'm not sure about that.     People have selective memories sometimes when&#13;
they're seeking to mske a point.     But certainly that style of comprehensive&#13;
economic work--comprehensive with the view of being operational--was&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
characteristic of what was is done in Latin America at that time.      The main&#13;
difference between then and now is that the lending instrument to reflect&#13;
the findings of this analysis didn't exist in quite the same form as it does&#13;
in today's SALs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    You may say that program lending was the same.      In most respects it was.&#13;
Non-project lending was an object of debate, even then.      There was prejudice&#13;
against it, prejudice that was in some cases based on the Articles of&#13;
Agreement, in other cases on a reluctance to break away from the familiar&#13;
and the comfortable.      In still other cases there was a serious reluctance to&#13;
become engaged in a level of debate with countries that was much more&#13;
difficult to manage, much more political, and much more sensitive.      These&#13;
issues are very much alive today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    My only point in referring to all this is that one had all of the&#13;
ingredients then of what has since become much more general Bank policy&#13;
today.     The agenda of dialogue has also broadened, to give more emphasis now&#13;
to matters of trade policy, public sector restructuring and the like.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I believe it was Gerry Alter who told me that when he was Director&#13;
for Latin America he was also very interested in more local currency loans&#13;
because he understood how the sector should expand and a fair amount of&#13;
local currency was needed.      He said that he ran into considerable opposition&#13;
to this, from George Woods in particular, who was then President of the&#13;
Bank.     Does this ring any bell with you?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Yes.   Now Gerry would know that better because Mr. Woods appointed&#13;
him as Director of the Department and he had interaction with him, which I&#13;
didn't at that time.      But certainly the issue of local currency financing&#13;
was a major issue.      The issue has never died.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Indeed it's an issue even today, is it not, in the case of sector&#13;
adjustment loans?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     It is an issue, and it isn't.    It's an issue that, among others,&#13;
can be used to illustrate the degree to which people are able to find&#13;
creative solutions to apparently intractable legal or ideological problems.&#13;
Outsiders often have accused Bank staff of being dishonest, not in a venal&#13;
sense, but in the sense of being excessively inventive in resolving&#13;
dilemmas, like calling foreign exchange financing something which by simpler&#13;
definitions could not reasonably be called foreign exchange financing.&#13;
I would not agree with those criticisms.        I think that the literal&#13;
interpretation of legal constraints sometimes led to much too narrow views&#13;
about what was appropriate for the Bank to do for a particular client.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       My sense is that, over the years, the sharp black and white early&#13;
attitudes towards that type of problem have diminished.        While the Bank&#13;
continues to finance foreign exchange, the foreign exchange content of a&#13;
particular operation is now defined more imaginatively, and appropriately.&#13;
In the context of that debate, the Bank, sometimes with great difficulty but&#13;
nevertheless in a very persistent direction, has also accepted increasingly&#13;
the financing of local expenditures in some degree.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Let me ask about a concrete case:     Were you ever aware of a&#13;
department suggesting the financing of a project which had a very large&#13;
foreign exchange component--but which it was almost certain the local&#13;
government was going to finance anyhow--primarily because that was going to&#13;
allow the local government to finance another project that required a lot of&#13;
local currency, so that the Bank was consciously interested in the other&#13;
project that required the local currency?       Might it ever be posed in that&#13;
way?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     I'm sure there are cases like that.     None that I can recall.   But I&#13;
don't think that within the organization there was any self-delusion on the&#13;
larger question.     Major infrastructure projects with a major foreign&#13;
exchange component didn't raise issues of that kind.        But I don't think that&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
the more serious people ever had any doubts that these projects, however&#13;
meritorious, were also chosen by the countries to figure prominently in&#13;
their operational relationship with the Bank because the Bank in those days&#13;
was not prepared to finance their education, health, or local water supply&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Even though it might be recognized that health and education, let's&#13;
say, might be very important sectors for overall development?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     That's correct.   There were these institutional theologies that had&#13;
to be respected, and this agreement on both sides that we do it this way.&#13;
The end was that the country had access to whatever foreign exchange&#13;
financing the Bank was prepared to provide.        The Bank was happy in that it&#13;
provided finance in ways that did not raise these larger questions, and the&#13;
country was equally happy in that, if they couldn't seek finance directly&#13;
for these other things, they could obtain the equivalent indirectly by&#13;
borrowing for these other purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That raises the larger question, of course, the old dog of a question&#13;
that never goes away:    whether the Bank isn't really financing, not the&#13;
projects it thinks it is, but a miserable marginal project that nobody ever&#13;
knows about and that isn't worth financing.        This argument has merit.   But I&#13;
think this happens less than is often asserted; for while it's perfectly&#13;
true that financial resources are fungible, real resources are less so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     In any event, the total amount of investment that is going on for&#13;
the country is almost certainly larger because of the Bank's involvement&#13;
with the country than it would be if there were no Bank involvement with the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Yes, marginally larger.   If I may, that observation invites me to&#13;
put a question to you, as an outsider:        Have we as an institution--forgive&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                   -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
me for saying we but my identities are still with the Bank--have we as an&#13;
institution had a propensity over the years to overestimate the influence we&#13;
can exert in our client countries?        The mere fact that I'm putting this&#13;
question suggests that I have some doubts.        I think it's something that is&#13;
worth reflection.       All the more so since people are agonizing now and have&#13;
been for some years, about the future of the Bank over the next ten, twenty,&#13;
thirty years.        This partly relates to the question of the size of the&#13;
financial intermediation that the Bank offers, and the influence that it can&#13;
exert simply in relationship to the size of the money flows.        But they&#13;
relate to a much larger question that has interested me:        what are the&#13;
limits of influence of an organization of this kind, of any outside&#13;
financing organization, on the aspects of development that the World Bank,&#13;
and other development financing agencies like it, seek to affect?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    You get different answers, of course, depending on what is being&#13;
financed:        an investment project--a city water supply or a regional&#13;
irrigation system, a sector investment program--a national power or&#13;
transportation or communications system, or changes in macrodevelopment and&#13;
financial policies.       I have often felt that this is a question that doesn't&#13;
have a clear answer.        But I have thought there would be much benefit to more&#13;
frank and open introspection on whether there are limits to the role of&#13;
development finance in causing countries to move in ways they wouldn't&#13;
otherwise move.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Just to clarify what you're saying, it seems to me there are two&#13;
separate ways of asking questions about the influence of the Bank.          The&#13;
first has to do with capital flows:       Has the total flow of capital to less&#13;
developed countries been longer than otherwise because of the Bank?           The&#13;
second question is one of policy:       Is the fiscal policy, the monetary&#13;
policy,    ~he   various investment policies of the developing countries&#13;
different from what would otherwise he because of the Bank?        I think these&#13;
are separable but related questions.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   They are separable and they are related, that's correct.        I have ,no&#13;
doubt that there are limits in both cases.      My only question is:     In what&#13;
degree?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   That probably varies a great deal from country to country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   That's correct.   Many of the internal policy debates on these&#13;
matters, while they're never formulated in quite these terms, have to do&#13;
with differing perceptions about where these limits really lie.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Well, let me ask you one other question about your Latin American&#13;
period.   It seems to me that your economic work about the whole of Latin&#13;
America was sufficiently good, both at the macro and micro level, that if&#13;
somebody had asked--as indeed somebody did ask in the 1964-1965 period--how&#13;
much additional external finance could be usefully used, it must have been&#13;
fairly easy for you and Gerry Alter and others to come up with an answer.&#13;
I'm thinking, of course, of the period when IDA replenishments were being&#13;
talked about in the Bank and the question was asked as to how much more&#13;
could the Bank usefully lend if it had the funds to lend on concessional&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Yes, I would agree with that.     I would also add by way of&#13;
qualification, however, that we then had much more conservative views about&#13;
debt and debt limits.   I smile when I think back to the effort that I&#13;
invested in wresting from the then-Minister of Finance of Mexico a letter on&#13;
debt policy.   It had never been done before.     I spoke very solemnly about&#13;
the concerns of the World Bank--debt service of the Government of Mexico&#13;
was rapidly approaching 10 percent of its annual export earnings--and how&#13;
these concerns would affect future lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Ten percent was sort of a rule of thumb?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                  -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Ten percent was the then-rule of thumb.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    That's very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   As with many things, inflation applies to the rules of thumb as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Well, in two respects.      Because the inflation elevated the nominal&#13;
export earnings with a bit of a lag after the debt.       But once the inflation&#13;
stopped, then the debt-service ratio changed.       But in a second sense, the&#13;
percent has gone up so that 20, 25 or even 30 percent is not now I think&#13;
regarded as excessive for some countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   That's true.    But it was interesting, too, to observe within myself&#13;
how that experience affected my own views about debt in other parts of the&#13;
world.    In the 1970s I was involved in Asia after the first oil shock, when&#13;
recycling became prominent in people's thinking, and flows of finance to the&#13;
countries that needed it became measured more in terms of resource movements&#13;
and less in terms of debt burdens, because of negative real interest rates&#13;
at the time.     I found myself worrying much more than some of my colleagues&#13;
about the cash flow implications of unrestrained lending to very poor&#13;
countries.     That concern reflected our earlier dialogue about debt in Latin&#13;
America, our constantly running interference on behalf of Latin American&#13;
governments against suppliers and export-oriented governments that were&#13;
shamelessly seeking to promote their exports without any thought about the&#13;
terms and the burden of the incremental debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    All this was set against the background of Latin American countries&#13;
having been among the major defaulters of the 1930s.       That had generated an&#13;
attitude toward debt which is clearly of another intellectual generation&#13;
than that which is dealing with debt today.       I had no sense then that the&#13;
irresponsibility of lenders, but even more of borrowers, would lead them to&#13;
collude in the accumulation of debt of the dimension that so many are now&#13;
suffering from.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Was it resisted pretty much by economic advisers in all the Area&#13;
departments?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I don't know, I cannot answer that.       I thought that there was much&#13;
merit in having a closer relationship with The Economic Adviser to the&#13;
President, to make the work more coherent, more interactive among the&#13;
different parts of the Bank.      There is an enormous amount one can learn from&#13;
the other Regions.      Horizontal communication was very, very limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       However,    I had, as I recall, reservations about the fundamental&#13;
objective, because it ran exactly opposite to what we had been talking&#13;
about, which was to make the integration of the lending work and the&#13;
economic work more effective, in order to have an operational posture&#13;
vis-a-vis the country that was based on both aspects of the work.         If that&#13;
integration were to be realized, it had to be done where the work was going&#13;
on.   It was difficult enough to effect integration within a department where&#13;
the economists were in divisions reporting to Operational division chiefs,&#13;
but had parallel lines of responsibility to the chief economists.        Across&#13;
the Bank, it would have been infinitely more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      So the fact that that didn't happen doesn't seem to me to have been an&#13;
opportunity that was lost.      However, it does prompt me to say, now that I&#13;
think of it, that it reflects the difference between the operational&#13;
environment of the Bank then and now.         There were lending operations, and&#13;
there was economic work that informed it, but the lending operations were&#13;
for the most part not instruments to pursue some of the major.policy&#13;
conclusions.      However, Gerry tried to do this in some key countries in Latin&#13;
America, and the Bank is now.trying to do it across the board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I don't quite know how to put this, but for lack of a better way,&#13;
did you ever feel like sort of a second-class citizen because you were an&#13;
economist?     This was obviously before you became a loan officer yourself.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[OLIVER)&#13;
Put another way, did you feel that economics was somehow underplayed or&#13;
received too little attention in the Area department itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I would have to answer yes.    Partly this is an expression of the&#13;
interest of individuals.    There were some people who weren't interested in&#13;
the Bank's operations, they were interested in doing their thing as country&#13;
analysts, and I doubt that people with that cast of mind were concerned.&#13;
But for those who were concerned about having the Bank's operational&#13;
involvement with the countries reflect the conclusions that emerged from the&#13;
economic analysis--in other words, reflect more than just the implementation&#13;
of a particular investment package, which we call the project--they were&#13;
concerned, of course.    What was so exciting about the Latin American region&#13;
at that time was that here, under Gerry's initiative, there was a concerted&#13;
effort, limited in terms of the number of cases, but nevertheless in the big&#13;
cases there was a concerted effort to make that marriage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The effort generated reactions.      I happened to be present during a&#13;
meeting with one of the country delegations at the Annual Meeting of the&#13;
World Bank held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1967.      The President, George&#13;
Woods, criticized the Western Hemisphere Department Director, then Gerald&#13;
Alter, for getting all mixed up in the International Monetary Fund's&#13;
business, because some of these country analyses led very directly to&#13;
operational conclusions about the need to adjust exchange rates.      Mr. Woods&#13;
insisted that this was the business of the Fund, obviously reflecting some&#13;
sort of gentleman's agreement about turf between the Managing Director of&#13;
the Fund at that time and Mr. Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I'm a little surprised at that because George Woods earlier had,&#13;
after consultation with Pierre-Paul Schwritzer in the Fund to be sure,&#13;
approved the Bernie [Bernard] Bell mission to India looking very much at the&#13;
question of a proper exchange rate, and accepted the proposition that you&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢&#13;
    WEINER                                  -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    [OLIVER]&#13;
    can't put together an overall package of macroeconomic adjustment without&#13;
    paying some attention to the exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WEINER:    Well, life is full of contradictions.       I'm sure this is just&#13;
    another one.    We shouldn't look for consistency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER:    I interrupted you.     I think you were about to say more about&#13;
    Gerry's reaction perhaps, or your reaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WEINER:    Well, there was nothing to react to.       Gerry was simply instructed&#13;
    to stay away from that, not to stay away from the analysis but to stay away&#13;
    from negotiating understandings on that subject with the countries.            This is&#13;
    an old subject which hasn't gone away.         The Fund and the Bank, to the best&#13;
    of my knowledge, continue today to seek to coexist in intelligent and not&#13;
    irrational ways.    When you have someone who is concerned with effecting this&#13;
    integration of economic and operational work, then you're forever at risk of&#13;
    getting into difficulties of this kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER:    There're even suggestions, as I'm sure you know, that today at the&#13;
    margin there's very little difference between Bank lending and Fund lending&#13;
    and maybe they should just be amalgamated into one enormous organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WEINER:    Yes, I've heard that.     It's a comment I've made myself at various&#13;
    points.    I think the differences would exist even if the two organizations&#13;
    were to have been folded one into the other.         There are turf problems within&#13;
    parts of the Bank today, and that would simply be another part.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The main advantage of folding the two institutions into each other would&#13;
    be that one would probably have more rational decisions about staffing, more&#13;
    rational dialogue with countries about these issues, and more rational&#13;
    decision processes internally.       Now there are two boards and two&#13;
    hierarchies, and when there are differences the resolution of those&#13;
    differences is difficult.       But I'm not sure that's a very important issue.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                  -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    What's far more important is that the apparent convergence means that&#13;
the two organizations are increasingly dealing with the whole array of&#13;
issues that they should be dealing with, and not just an artificial fragment&#13;
of that reality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I guess it goes without saying that the Bank--looking at just the&#13;
Bank itself--does pay more attention to macroeconomic issues at the national&#13;
country level than it did, let's say, back in the 1950s and 1960s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Yes, as far as I can tell.    I don't think that the experience that&#13;
I described to you of Latin America in the 1960s could be generalized to the&#13;
Bank at that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, I think we might go on and talk about your experience with&#13;
project work.     You said earlier, if I remember correctly, that that was a&#13;
particularly interesting period of your life, that you found very&#13;
interesting people and that you had some very interesting subjects when you&#13;
became a project person.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    How shall I begin?   The project work had always been the mainstay&#13;
of the Bank's operational business.      It was not then as it is today a&#13;
subject of debate as to whether this was the proper thing for the Bank to be&#13;
doing.     Stanley Please in his little pamphlet, The Hobbled Giant, argues the&#13;
extreme of the new view about the Bank, which is that project lending is&#13;
passe, for non-project lending gives one a more effective handle on policy,&#13;
which is where the real development issues have to be resolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Might I just interject, the more it changes, the more it stays the&#13;
same, in a sense.     Because that's precisely what Paul Rosenstein-Rodin was&#13;
arguing at the time you came into the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;'WEINER                              -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'WEINER:   Yes, yes, I'm well aware of that.    My own view, just to put&#13;
whatever comments may later emerge in context, is that the protagonists at&#13;
one extreme or the other, are both right and they're both wrong.      My own&#13;
view has always been that the Bank must engage its clients on policy issues&#13;
because, if the policies are wrong, there's no reasonable basis for&#13;
expecting that the benefits of the project will be realized as expected, to&#13;
say nothing about the economic costs of misconceived projects.      But it&#13;
doesn't therefore follow, as some people now argue, that the only way you&#13;
can engage your clients fruitfully on policies is by putting money on the&#13;
table for that particular purpose.     That's certainly true in some cases, but&#13;
it may not be true in others; indeed, it may be counterproductive in cases.&#13;
The critics of the Bank's project preoccupation--obsession, some would&#13;
say--are right if the operational managers of the Bank look only at the&#13;
projects, without any concern for what lies outside of their portfolio or&#13;
what's happening in the country at large.      There's no doubt that the Bank&#13;
has invested in projects like that, some of them successfully, many of them&#13;
unsuccessfully, and the operations evaluation record suggests that where we&#13;
had bad experience, it was very much on those grounds.     We can come back to&#13;
that later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But it doesn't follow that using the project as the lending instrument&#13;
necessarily restricts one's perspective to that.      There may well be cases in&#13;
which an investment loan, be it at the level of a project, or the level of a&#13;
sector, or at the level of several sectors, might be the best vehicle for&#13;
reaching explicit understandings about the policy context.      Policy-based&#13;
lending is appropriate in the right circumstances, whether it is called&#13;
program lending, as it was called in the 1960s, or structural adjustment&#13;
lending as it is called in the 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But my own view is that policy-based lending is not the answer to all&#13;
development problems; there is a role for intelligently conceived and well&#13;
designed investment project lending.    But most important is the role of&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                              -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
intelligently conceived and managed country lending programs.   These lending&#13;
programs are for me the key operational instrument of the Bank; that is, the&#13;
aggregation of the structural adjustment loans and the sector loans and the&#13;
project loans which, all together, can be designed to focus on an agenda of&#13;
issues with the countries.   The real Bank lever, as I see it, is neither an&#13;
SAL nor a project, but the set of activities called the country program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now I presume that when I and David Knox and Warren Baum, in the reverse&#13;
order, were assigned to Projects director positions in the late 1960s, it&#13;
was with a view towards beginning to effect that kind of operational&#13;
integration.   We had all lived on the other side of this operational divide,&#13;
and had training, education and experience to help make the link between&#13;
investment and policy, and to bridge the objectives of discrete projects and&#13;
of the sets of projects and programs that the more senior managers sought to&#13;
have better integrated.   All of that was the forerunner, of course, of the&#13;
reorganization of 1972.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    What were my recollections, then?   Well, my recollection certainly is of&#13;
a very harmonious, happy and fruitful relationship with very professional&#13;
people whom I admired as technocrats and as people.   They understood that&#13;
they were not going to be second-guessed by someone who was not part of&#13;
their professional fraternity, but rather would be supported by someone who&#13;
sought to broaden the context in which they were doing their work.     That was&#13;
the period in which the project, in the sector context, became more&#13;
institutionalized and generalized than it had been before, although we're&#13;
talking about differences in degree, not basic changes in direction.     The&#13;
projects analysis agenda continued to broaden.   By that I mean that what had&#13;
historically been strong, namely the technical, financial, commercial and&#13;
institutional analysis of projects, became increasingly concerned from the&#13;
late 1960s on with the economic justification of projects and economic&#13;
issues of the sector in question.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                   -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     When you say more economic, does that imply that more externalities&#13;
were taken into account when computing benefit-cost ratios, let's say?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Was there a distinction made between financial feasibility and&#13;
economic feasibility?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Very clearly so.     The externalities were there and became part of&#13;
the analysis only where they were unusual and determining in a particular&#13;
case.     No, what I'm referring to was fundamentally the insistence on the&#13;
distinction between financial and economic analysis, for sometimes the&#13;
results were different.        The review and approval process for appraisals&#13;
became much more searching in these matters.        The efficiency aspects of the&#13;
analysis, economic efficiency, was the key to that era.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In later years, that was broadened to include social cost-benefit&#13;
analysis.     However, although learned treatises were written on the subject,&#13;
it never became a central part of the economic analysis of Bank projects.&#13;
The refinements were always in the efficiency analysis.        Shadow pricing was&#13;
used when market pricing led to strange results, or to confirm that the&#13;
market pricing used in the analysis did not lead to strange results.        But&#13;
the more elaborate--and, in the minds of some, more speculative--social&#13;
cost-benefit analysis where you introduced weights about the distribution of&#13;
costs and benefits by income groups, and by time between consumption and&#13;
investment, remained, as I recollect, on the margins of Bank analyses.          They&#13;
were never internalized centrally into the Bank's thinking and practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Didn't the new emphasis upon rural agriculture in the middle&#13;
McNamara years stem in part from what you're talking about?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     I would have reversed the sequence.   Like so much of what we do--if&#13;
I may refer to we since you're an economics professor and I at least came&#13;
out of that background, although I don't claim to be a member of the&#13;
fraternity any more--we tend to rationalize and justify ex post insights&#13;
which are valid but grow out of other sources.      The development initiatives&#13;
that were central to the McNamara era were an operational expression of the&#13;
concern for poverty, which he made central to the Bank's institutional&#13;
concerns.     That was not the product of this kind of analysis; the analysis&#13;
followed rather than preceded the event.     There's nothing wrong with that.&#13;
That's my sense of what happened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Those were the main points, namely a stronger concern with economic&#13;
analysis of projects.     Certainly in my own work I tried to make this concern&#13;
substantive rather than cosmetic.     The bureaucratic environment of the time&#13;
unfortunately seemed to generate for some the perception that all that was&#13;
wanted was a number.     I recall sending back reports saying the number was&#13;
fine, but that alone did not the answer the question: why is this project&#13;
worthwhile?     You cannot answer that just with a number.   Why this number and&#13;
not another?     What are the alternatives and what are the assumptions?   Since&#13;
the margins of maneuver in estimating these numbers was wide, some concluded&#13;
that all economic return estimates were subject to cooking, and therefore&#13;
worthless.     All one had to do was find out what was wanted and produce the&#13;
number.     The reason that lay behind it, the underlying reason why this was&#13;
or was not on its face a worthwhile project, was lost to these individuals.&#13;
To get the full benefit of this powerful analysis was part of the management&#13;
challenge at that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you ever have the feeling that you were being pushed in some&#13;
sense to speak favorably about a project before you really were satisfied&#13;
you had the information you needed?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   I never had that feeling.    And I don't think that any of my&#13;
associates ever had that feeling.     Certainly, if they ever did I exerted&#13;
myself very quickly to disabuse them of it.       I felt that one of my principal&#13;
assignments was to cultivate an atmosphere of integrity of analysis, and to&#13;
protect the staff from pressures of this kind.       But the larger institutional&#13;
environment did generate misperceptions about the role of numbers, and more&#13;
importantly, misperceptions about the urgency to complete lending programs,&#13;
that is commitment volumes by particular dates, with people's careers being&#13;
on the line.     That could have been corrupting, and no doubt was corrupting&#13;
in the minds of some individuals and possibly in some corners of the Bank.&#13;
But I never felt that pressure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Let me illustrate this with one interesting case, because it's revealing&#13;
of a problem in managing an organization and of having professional staff&#13;
appreciate what is really expected of them.      We had at one time a water&#13;
project, a big municipal water project, in some North African country, I&#13;
don't recall which at the moment.     The staff completed their analysis, which&#13;
included an estimated return on the project.       The rules were that you&#13;
estimated the economic benefits on the basis of the prices for which the&#13;
service--in this case water--was sold, recognizing that these were not&#13;
market prices.    This was the basis for estimate in the report.     You will not&#13;
be surprised to hear that the draft appraisal report showed that, in this&#13;
particular case, the return was so close to zero that it wasn't clear&#13;
whether it was plus or minus, and it rang bells all over the place.         We went&#13;
over the text.    It seemed to be right.     The right kind of qualifying&#13;
commentary on the significance of the estimate was made:       the number did not&#13;
reflect the economic merits of the project because, given the way water&#13;
prices were determined, they didn't begin to reflect the economic value of&#13;
this water.    The people who didn't have access to the water system were&#13;
paying twenty times that for water off a truck, often polluted besides.         The&#13;
text said all of that.    The number was there because the organization&#13;
required it, but the text went on to say, don't pay any attention to this&#13;
number; the project remains a worthwhile project because all of the&#13;
alternatives are more expensive, or less feasible.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                   -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    Within 24 hours after that draft landed on my desk, the then-Director of&#13;
the Program Department--remember, we were still under the old organization&#13;
of projects and programs being quite separate--came to me white with worry.&#13;
How can we possibly proceed with a project with this low rate of return?&#13;
They'll have our heads for it.        Yet we have to do this project because it's&#13;
the biggest one in this country's lending program, it's so important for the&#13;
region, and so forth,        He couldn't get over my response, which was to laugh&#13;
at him and say, "What are you worried about?        It's a perfectly good project,&#13;
                        11&#13;
the document says so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    He said, "What?     Yes, but look at the number."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And so we went back and forth on this and I said, "Well, relax.         We'll&#13;
do it.     I'll take responsibility and stand up for this particular case".         He&#13;
was terribly worried.        Because of our separate lines of authority he had to&#13;
accept that decision, but he clearly was very uncomfortable,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The long and the short of it was that when that project was presented to&#13;
the Board not long after, one of the Directors found occasion to&#13;
congratulate the President for bringing this particular project to the&#13;
Board, because it gave the lie to all of those who felt that the Bank was&#13;
being run by the numbers.       Here was obviously a sensible decision, a&#13;
sensible investment, that was being presented without concern for the low&#13;
number that was supposed to be the decision trigger for the Board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That was an interesting story.        It's also a sad story because my guess&#13;
is that was an unusual story in the larger institutional environment of the&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I was going to ask a related question.      It has been rumored that&#13;
Mr. McNamara as a person and as a President was very much interested in&#13;
projections of loan commitments aver time.       My question is, did he ever talk&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[OLIVER]&#13;
to you about trying to push a project before you thought it was ready&#13;
because he had heard that the project was behind schedule in some sense?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    There were episodes in which Mr. McNamara called me on the direct&#13;
line to inquire about the reasons for delay in projects, having been&#13;
informed by his budget people who track these things that certain projects,&#13;
important projects, were being delayed.     The thrust of his question always&#13;
was that delay is bad because it means benefits foregone to the client.     The&#13;
countries are poor, they need these resources, they need the investments,&#13;
and therefore we should to the best of our ability move the projects ahead.&#13;
His question could be construed as an implied criticism for delay.     But in&#13;
each of the cases which were the occasion for these inquiries, the facts&#13;
turned out to be that the delays were not due to sloth, or poor estimates of&#13;
schedules, but to deliberate delays by the staff to ensure that critical&#13;
issues under debate with the borrower were resolved in ways that would&#13;
protect the realization of expected benefits.     Once those facts became&#13;
clear, and I related them to the President, the whole issue of delays in the&#13;
schedules disappeared.   My own conviction was that the schedules were there&#13;
as instruments of institutional discipline, but were never to be used, nor&#13;
did the President ever expect his managers to use them, in ways that&#13;
generated commitments of poor quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now in the reality of things, those perceived pressures sometimes&#13;
induced staff to make shortcuts, as some unhappy cases subsequently revealed&#13;
through the operations evaluation system show.     But my sense is that,&#13;
although there were cases of this kind--and it's not surprising that there&#13;
should be cases of this kind. in an organization as large and complex as the&#13;
Bank, where the President is so distant from the working level of the&#13;
staff--nonetheless my reading of the evidence is that they were exceptions&#13;
and not systemic.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    While the pressures on the staff for realizing the commitment programs&#13;
was high, not surprisingly because that pressure came in the last instance&#13;
from the Board, from the borrowers of the Bank who were very concerned that&#13;
there not be shortfalls in the Bank's commitment programs, they were never&#13;
expressed in ways, and should never have been accepted by managers and staff&#13;
in ways to permit serious compromise in the substance of what the Bank was&#13;
doing.     My own view has always been that those who either through ignorance&#13;
or a misplaced sense of loyalty did succumb to pressures of this kind were&#13;
engaging in something that, at the risk of sounding extreme, I'd say was&#13;
fundamentally immoral.     It was immoral in the sense that they were being&#13;
party to generating incremental debt for     borrowers with the less than&#13;
adequate assurance that the real justification of this debt--be it IDA        or&#13;
Bank debt--which was the benefit stream from these investments, would be&#13;
realized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, you mentioned the magic words operations and evaluation, and&#13;
I wonder if we might spend a little time talking about that.     I wonder if a&#13;
good lead in the transition from what you were just saying is just this&#13;
question:     Is there any evidence that with considerable increase in Bank&#13;
lending that occurred in the McNamara years, there was on the average any&#13;
decrease in the quality of the projects that were being funded, as has&#13;
turned out ex post through an operations evaluation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     My reading of the evidence is that the answer to that is no.&#13;
Indeed, as we were saying before, there was good reason to say every time&#13;
that question emerged at the Board, which it did from time to time, on&#13;
average the quality of the Bank's projects was increasing rather than&#13;
decreasing.     That normally meant increasing in the sense that the analysis&#13;
was more comprehensive, and therefore the design of the project was more&#13;
responsive to economic considerations, as well as all of the usual ones.&#13;
But more importantly, the mix of projects, and therefore their purpose as a&#13;
mix of Bank lending, was increasingly beginning to address the much more&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
difficult long term and fundamental issues of the countries: rural poverty,&#13;
illiteracy, poor health, and all of those things which have taken in those&#13;
years an ever larger share of the Bank's commitment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The fact that the Bank was more willing to address difficult issues, to&#13;
staff itself to analyze them and to assume the risk that that implied to its&#13;
reputation of having projects which were uniformly disappointing and&#13;
bad--that fact was, as I have always felt, justification for the answer:&#13;
No, the projects have not been declining in quality but have been improving.&#13;
This is always subject, of course, to the expectation that these projects,&#13;
after the event, turn out to have generated benefits as planned.    My reading&#13;
of the evidence to date, as we saw it through our operations evaluation, is&#13;
that quality has not been declining.    The real risk, of course, was always&#13;
borne by the borrower, not the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There were failures, some of them inexcusable failures, but in context&#13;
the failures were not representative.    We're talking about proportions of&#13;
projects judged to be worthwhile and not worthwhile being in the ratio of&#13;
ninety to ten.    That includes all kinds of projects, new style as well as&#13;
old, with no pronounced difference in the observed evidence between new and&#13;
old style.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The sad concentration of failures were reflective of other&#13;
considerations.   They were overwhelmingly in agriculture in Africa, clearly&#13;
an area where you would not expect the rest of the Bank's experience to be&#13;
replicated.   Sad in the sense that those were the clients who could least&#13;
afford failure.   There, an unfeeling critic might say that see, this simply&#13;
proves that the staff were bashing ahead in response to numbers and not in&#13;
response to problems.   That's one possible interpretation.   I'm not sure&#13;
it's a fair interpretation.    I think the fairer interpretation is that the&#13;
institution knowingly decided to accept a much higher level of risk of&#13;
failure in these areas in those countries.    And in retrospect, I think they&#13;
have turned out to be the only right thing to have done.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   But in general the process of increasing lending illustrated the,&#13;
proposition that with more loans the absorptive capacity increased rather&#13;
than decreased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   That was the purpose of the lending in large part.     The Bank was an&#13;
agent to increase absorptive capacity, which was not a given.      That's&#13;
exactly .right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Now you became Director General of Operations Evaluation at about&#13;
what year?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   October 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   1975.   And you served in that capacity until when?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Until June 1984, when I retired from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   And were you pretty much in charge of finding ways and means of&#13;
evaluating projects?      Is that a subject that we should talk about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Yes, I think it's worth talking about because the experience is&#13;
rather unique--unique to the institution, and unique in the way we&#13;
eventually ended up doing this work.     There were no organizational models to&#13;
follow.   We found our way by doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When I came into this position, there was already an Operations&#13;
Evaluation Department [OED].     It was fairly small, about ten staff, and it&#13;
had published--published meaning issued to the Board--a number of special&#13;
studies on the Bank's experience with operations in particular sectors and&#13;
in particular countries.     They had also begun selectively to review&#13;
individual projects.      So there was already an evolution of the kind of work&#13;
which was being done even in that small Department.      The Department had been&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -32-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
conceived at Mr. McNamara's initiative, as far as I know, in the very early&#13;
1970s and had evolved from a unit in the Programming and Budgeting&#13;
Department of the Bank to a separate department, always responding to a line&#13;
of command that was independent of Operations, so that there would be a&#13;
distance and an independence of view in the analysis of this experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    To be specific, you reported directly to the Executive Directors&#13;
rather than through the President?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I did, but that was new.   Before that, the Director of the&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department reported to the President of the Bank, but&#13;
through a non-operational Vice President.    The structural innovation in the&#13;
creation of the office of Director General, Operations Evaluation, was to&#13;
take that function and remove it from the control of the President and have&#13;
it report directly to the Board, with all kinds of guarantees of&#13;
independence, like appointment by the Board for a limited five-year term,&#13;
removable only at the pleasure of the Board, renewable only by decision of&#13;
the Board.    The incumbent could not, wherever he came from, enter or&#13;
re-enter the staff of the Bank from that position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    So it was a bit of a dilemma for you, who had at least ten years of&#13;
time to go in the Bank as to whether to accept this, I should have thought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Yes, a dilemma which was resolved in less than 24 hours.      I&#13;
responded to the challenge of something new.    And in retrospect it was the&#13;
right thing to do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Who were some of the people who had done operations evaluation in&#13;
the earlier department, before you took on this job?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Well, the real founder of this function in the Bank was Christopher&#13;
[R.] Willoughby, who was the first appointee to that unit.     He created the&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -33-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER)&#13;
small unit in the Programming and Budgeting Department which then became the&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department.      He's now the Director of EDI [Economic&#13;
Development Institute] and he can fill you in on its earliest history.         As I&#13;
recall, when I moved into the position of Director General of Operations&#13;
Evaluation, he remained the Director of the Department for a little over a&#13;
year, but then moved on to become a Director in the Central Projects Staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Was John [H.] Adler in charge of budget at that time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    John Adler was in charge of budget at that time.    I think this was&#13;
after John [H.] Wil:liams.     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Chris was the real founder and I think he deserves the real credit.         All&#13;
that we did was to build on what he did.      But in the building, we initiated&#13;
institutional innovation of the following sort.      At the end of 1975 when we&#13;
had this organizational rearrangement, operations evaluations were the&#13;
products of the Operations Evaluation Department.      The operational staff&#13;
were only suppliers of information and commentators on drafts; they&#13;
interacted, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes supportively, sometimes&#13;
with great resistance, sometimes even worse.      But the evaluation products&#13;
were the products of the Operations Evaluation Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It seemed to me after being in that position for some time that while&#13;
it was appropriate at the initiating stages of a function of this kind, it&#13;
was not a sustainable process over the longer term.      It created excess&#13;
institutional friction.      The process was perceived as denying the&#13;
operational staff, who actually knew the experiences of the Bank better than&#13;
any evaluator could, a voice in the product,     When findings differed in some&#13;
way from their own perceptions, there was not only a lot of shouting, but&#13;
sometimes misunderstanding about intent and a lot of profound frustration&#13;
that other views about the experience were not being permitted to surface.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -34-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    These considerations led me to conclude that the process had to be&#13;
redesigned to include all the principal actors in the evaluation process.&#13;
Instead of using what emerged from the Operational staff, the Regions, as&#13;
just inputs into an operations evaluation product, what we said is that&#13;
henceforth those inputs will be independent products on their own.       We would&#13;
no longer speak of operations evaluation as the activity just of an&#13;
Operations Evaluation staff, but as a Bank-wide function in which the&#13;
Operations Evaluation staff had a key role, but in which all Operational&#13;
staff also had a key role.     The role of the Operational staff was no longer&#13;
simply to supply raw material to an independent Operational staff, but to be&#13;
actors in their own right, and generate their own evaluations of the&#13;
operations for which they were responsible.     Self-evaluation was the real&#13;
innovation which we built into the Bank's process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I still remember very clearly my first meeting with the Projects&#13;
directors assembled from all the Regions, whom I knew as former colleagues&#13;
and with whom I had had occasion to discuss complaints about earlier&#13;
products of the Operations Evaluation Department.     I said to them, "We're&#13;
going to change the arrangements.     From now on you will recount the project&#13;
experience the way you want to tell it, so you will no longer have any basis&#13;
for complaining about the way somebody else told it.     The completion report&#13;
that you used to do on a sometimes basis, you will now do on an all-the-time&#13;
basis.     And these reports will now be final reports that you will issue on&#13;
your responsibility and that I will send to the Board.     You won't send them&#13;
to the Board, I will send them to the Board with OED comments attached.        Our&#13;
evaluation of individual projects will henceforth be a performance audit of&#13;
the project, generating commentary on your evaluation.     If we agreed with&#13;
your assessment, we would say so.     If we disagreed, we say in what respects&#13;
we disagreed.     The combined product, your completion report and our&#13;
supplementary commentary, would be packaged into one paper which we now&#13;
called a "project performance audit report."&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    That eventually became the foundation stone of the new operations&#13;
evaluation system.   Here was 100 percent coverage of projects through&#13;
completion reports, and, in the early years, hundred percent review by the&#13;
operations evaluation staff of the project completion reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The first reactions by the people who had been the most ready to&#13;
complain before about what the evaluation staff said about their projects,&#13;
was one of great shock.     The luxury of complaining was now being denied&#13;
them, and was being replaced by a responsibility.       Part of their reaction&#13;
was psychological, and understandable.       Part of it was real, and justified,&#13;
because they perceived immediately that if they were going to produce&#13;
evaluations on their own responsibility for the Board, they would have to do&#13;
them rather more seriously than before, and that this would have a cost,&#13;
which was not now funded.    Given the budget management of the Bank, that was&#13;
a matter of real concern.    They were justified in that concern.     As I&#13;
recollect, it took three years before completion reporting became a separate&#13;
line item in the authorized budgets of these departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Completion reports were now to be the final act in the supervision&#13;
cycle.Â· But this last supervision report would not just build on the&#13;
previous one, it would cover the whole history, it would synthesize the&#13;
project experience and reflect on it. It would not only reflect on whether&#13;
the project tuned out to be worthwhile, and whether the benefits expected of&#13;
what was actually completed justified the cost actually incurred.       It would&#13;
also reflect on what lessons there were for the Bank in the experience and&#13;
the problems that had been encountered.      Some of these completion reports&#13;
were superb; a few were pitifully inadequate; some were exorbitantly&#13;
expensive and some were reasonable.     It took a while to develop a consensus&#13;
about what was a reasonable cost of this product,       But that was only to be&#13;
expected.,&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -36-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    I also insisted that OED be reasonable in their review of completion&#13;
reports.    For it is too easy to criticize; documents can always be better.&#13;
Having the mantle of evaluation staff and sitting in judgment on others did&#13;
not give them the luxury of being exempt from criticism themselves.       Thus,&#13;
we designed an interactive process which made the final product subject to&#13;
comment _from both sides.   The Regional staff now had the right to adapt&#13;
their drafts if they felt that OED observations were serious and valid, and&#13;
vice versa.    Some Executive Directors couldn't understand this interaction&#13;
at all.    They thought that we were in collusion against them; the very idea&#13;
of operational and evaluation staff talking to each other before their&#13;
reports were made final didn't sound right.       It had never happened that way&#13;
in their governments, so why should it be any different in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    It sounded to them like a cover-up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Yes, it sounded to them like a cover-up.     By implication they were&#13;
also saying to me, "You may have all of the trappings of independence, but&#13;
we really don't believe in the trappings or your professions of integrity&#13;
because you come from the Bank and therefore cannot really be expected to be&#13;
truly independent."   We had some very interesting discussions about this in&#13;
the early days; but all of that soon passed away, I am pleased to say.&#13;
I recall especially and with appreciation the comment of the then Executive&#13;
Director for Japan who told me, three years later, when he was ready to&#13;
leave the Bank, "You know, I was very unhappy with this arrangement.&#13;
I didn't like it but I was prepared to see what happened.       I'm happy to tell&#13;
you that, now that I've seen how it's settled down, all of my concerns have&#13;
vanished, concerns about collusion, concerns about lack of independence, and&#13;
above all, concerns about self censorship and the unwillingness to be&#13;
forthright."   He and many of his colleagues simply could not conceive of&#13;
Bank staff, as evaluators, shedding their inhibitions about saying things&#13;
that might be unflattering about the Bank.       But as the evidence began to&#13;
accumulate, those fears gradually began to disappear.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -37-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    We had one argument of a very different nature in those early years with&#13;
Executive Directors.     We would meet with them every month, at the Joint&#13;
Audit Committee, which had oversight of this function.       They would say, "We&#13;
know the Bank is a fine organization, so we're not interested in you telling&#13;
us all of the splendid things that it's doing.       We want to know the things&#13;
that aren't going right, and what has to be done to fix them, so that we can&#13;
be sure that they're being fixed."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    My response was, "But that's not all you want to know, surely, because&#13;
if that's all you hear from me, that's all you will know, and you will be&#13;
induced to generalize from that experience and think that everything is&#13;
wrong.     That would be distorting, and I don't want to be a party to that.&#13;
If that's all you want, you will have to find somebody else."       Sooner or&#13;
later that, too, disappeared with the evidence,       I thought it was very&#13;
important to put cases in context, because it is too easy to generalize from&#13;
failure.     The real issue was whether the generalizations were valid or not.&#13;
In some cases they were, in most cases they were not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The second issue was that where there were problems, were the problems&#13;
being addressed?    We tried to address this forthrightly.     And the President&#13;
insisted that his senior operational staff respond to the Board whenever the&#13;
evaluation staff made recommendations.       We refused to make recommendations&#13;
on the basis of individual projects, because that was too slender a basis&#13;
for generalizing.     But we didn't hesitate to make recommendations on the&#13;
basis of groups of projects, whether in special studies or annual reviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That's the way the system evolved.       With it, we the Bank bacame a&#13;
genuinely self-evaluating organization.       The project cycle was no longer&#13;
described as concluding with the final disbursements and supervision.         The&#13;
final act of the project cycle was now the post-evaluation.       And the post-&#13;
evaluation was understood now by everybody to mean an act of self-evaluation&#13;
by the responsible unit, and a review of that by the Operations Evaluation&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -38-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
staff.     All that was new; it was not clearly in the work program or in the&#13;
style of work of the original Operations Evaluation Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Only two things of significance have happened since.       One, with the&#13;
growth in numbers of operations, the Board and the management were faced&#13;
with a budget issue: Would OED continue to review every single project, the&#13;
way we did at the beginning, or would we begin to review selectively?          I'm&#13;
speaking about the Operations Evaluation Department's review.       We proposed&#13;
several years ago to cut the 100 percent review down to a 50 percent review,&#13;
but structure it in such a way that there was a random element to the&#13;
selection process.     Part of it would be purposeful, to group projects to&#13;
illustrate certain issues by Region, by function, or by problem; but part of&#13;
it would be random to ensure that real dogs, if there were any, would not be&#13;
left out by design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    That was a matter of some concern on the part of the Board.       We had to&#13;
organize special meetings simply to reassure the Directors.       Selectivity was&#13;
introduced on a trial basis.     The alternative was either to increase QED's&#13;
budget to permit coverage of all    projects--~nd   that represented an enormous&#13;
percentage increase in the budget, way out of line with what was happening&#13;
in the rest of the Bank--or to allow that coverage to increase at the&#13;
expense of the special studies program.      I resisted the latter because&#13;
that's where the real value of having a separate evaluation department&#13;
ultimately lay.     It was not just in auditing what other people did, to keep&#13;
them honest, but rather in making comparative analyses of this experience.&#13;
Ultimately, the Directors agreed and opted for 50 percent coverage.       This&#13;
happened when the big surge in lending volume in the 1970s began to appear&#13;
at the evaluation stage some years later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I do have one quick question on this general subject.    Back in the&#13;
1960s Professor Albert Hirschman was hired by the Bank to do operations&#13;
evaluations of a sort.     He produced a book called Development ProJects&#13;
Observed.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Yes, I remember that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Is anything like that done anymore, where some years after the&#13;
project is totally finished a look is taken by a total outsider, so to&#13;
speak?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   The work program of the Operations Evaluation Department does&#13;
include elements of that; nothing quite so elaborate, b~t effectively the&#13;
same thing.   When I left, two reviews were just beginning of country.&#13;
operations programs in countries of major lending by the Bank and IDA,&#13;
headed by outsiders.    That was new for the operations evaluation function.&#13;
Those reports have since come out, and I'm sure there will be others.&#13;
Meanwhile, a substantial part of the Bank's now much-enlarged research&#13;
program can be described as something quite similar.    Some of that is done&#13;
by outsiders, some within the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   There's a sense in which the Economic Committee of the 1960s&#13;
sought to provide a pre-economic evaluation of projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Correct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   If done again afterwards, that would have been somewhat similar to&#13;
what we were talking about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Correct.   The other thing that I wanted to mention is that the&#13;
QED's work program also includes revisiting projects ten, fifteen years&#13;
after completion.    The process earlier I was describing finishes a year or&#13;
two after the investment is completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   I've heard that.    And the flow of benefits might change&#13;
considerably after ten   year~.&#13;
&amp;#12;~INER                                    -40-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     That's correct.     There's now ample evidence to reassure ourselves&#13;
that Hirschman's insights were valid.           They certainly strengthened my&#13;
prejudices about the limits of blueprints in planning.           Projects have to be&#13;
managed for their whole lives.       The initiation of an investment doesn't mean&#13;
that it's going to turn out the way it was planned, and the initiation of&#13;
its operational phase doesn't mean that the benefits are going to turn out&#13;
as planned.     Often there are events that cause things to change completely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The judgments of worthwhileness have been sustained in most of the&#13;
second look cases that I remember.       When I left there were only about a&#13;
half-dozen of these cases.       But those that were reversed were dramatic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I wish we had time today to ask you to illustrate that remark, but&#13;
I think maybe we'd better stop.       We've kept you going for two hours now and&#13;
perhaps another time we can do another hour on some of these specifics.&#13;
Anyhow, thank you so much today.       I think it's been a fascinating&#13;
conversation.     I think you will enjoy seeing the transcript when it's&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     I hope you find it useful.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    We were talking about the operations evaluation work.        It might be&#13;
well for me now to ask if you could illustrate a bit about this work by&#13;
identify~ng    a project or two that was less than totally successful, and&#13;
perhaps some that stand out in your memory as being particularly successful.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   The dramatic failures in numbers and in the sectors that I   refer~ed&#13;
&#13;
to yesterday were very sadly concentrated where the costs of failure were&#13;
least able. to be borne, namely in the agricultural sector of the poor&#13;
African members of the Bank.   I can't recall case names at the moment, and&#13;
that's not a diplomatic evasion.     I'm reluctant to misname projects or&#13;
countries; but I'll mention two that come to mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    One was a cattle development project, a rural development project&#13;
focused on increasing the cattle herd and the carrying capacity of land.&#13;
That turned out to have been a failure for reasons having to do with the&#13;
fact that this was conceived as a technical problem related to the carrying&#13;
capacity of land and how that could be raised, and breeds of cattle and how&#13;
they could be improved, and the increases in productivity of cattle in terms&#13;
of making them more productive, more calves per head of herd and better&#13;
survival rates and all of these things which people who are experts in that&#13;
area would tend to concentrate on.    The best available advice in the world,&#13;
coming in large part from Australia and New Zealand, was focused on&#13;
resolving these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The question then arises, why did the thing fail?    Well, it failed&#13;
because at that stage the Bank was still in its earliest learning phase&#13;
about the fact that raising cattle in Africa, certainly in this part of&#13;
Africa, was a social process and not simply an economic activity in the way&#13;
that it's known in the industrialized world.    The Bank failed to take&#13;
account who owned what and how they related to each other, and who had&#13;
access to grazing lands, and what was implied in the technical development&#13;
of grazing lands and restricting access to those lands in order to protect&#13;
the better pasture.   These were aspects that either were not considered at&#13;
all or, if considered, were not adequately evaluated.     The failure was not a&#13;
technical failure; it was a social failure.    Protected grazing lands were&#13;
invaded by people who resented their exclusion from them; fences were torn;&#13;
tribal animosities were exacerbated rather than relieved.     In brief, the&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -42-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
solution to a problem that was mis-defined as a technical problem was the&#13;
occasion for this very unhappy experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It wasn't the only one, but I think there was dramatic learning from&#13;
that.     It happened to be a project, if I'm not mistaken, which was a prize&#13;
exhibit by the President of that country during a visit by the President of&#13;
the Bank.     And we all heard much about it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I take it that an objective of the project had been to increase the&#13;
number and the health of the cattle, and the people who were in charge of&#13;
doing this specifically on the spot treated the cattle in a traditional way&#13;
rather than paying attention to new ways and means of dealing with them.           Is&#13;
that what happened?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Well, it was dealing with cattle as the output of a production&#13;
system rather than cattle as a symbol of status in the society, a means of&#13;
holding wealth, and above all cattle that in the traditional local society&#13;
required land and very complex relationships about who had access to what&#13;
grazing lands and under what conditions.        These issues simply had not been&#13;
adequately reflected in the arrangements.        That's my recollection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     But the objective was to raise more cattle to go to the market?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     The objective was to raise more cattle to go to the market, that's&#13;
correct.     I have no reason to think that the objective defined that way was&#13;
in any way to be faulted, because the raising of more cattle in fact was to&#13;
raise the wealth of the cattle owners which was the larger social&#13;
development objective of this whole process.        But it was misconceived in the&#13;
circumstances and I'm sure it was that, among other experiences, that&#13;
shocked the Bank into realizing that there were other dimensions of its&#13;
projects that it had to integrate into its analyses, and social&#13;
anthropologists began to appear on the scene.        There still aren't many of&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                  -43-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
them, but nevertheless they have an effect and the technicians, the&#13;
engineers, the agronomists, the veterinarians, those people, carry the&#13;
burden now of satisfying the social anthropologists that they have arranged&#13;
for these other dimensions to be integrated into their analyses.          That's one&#13;
type.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     A colleague of mine at Caltech [California Institute of Technology]&#13;
named Ted Scudder is an anthropologist who does a good deal of consulting&#13;
work for the Bank and on this very subject.       He frequently is asked to&#13;
evaluate the social consequences of some Bank project, the leading one being&#13;
the Kariba Dam in Zambia.       He has studied the tribal patterns of people who&#13;
lived in the land that became flooded, who had to be moved because of the&#13;
dam.     He's now in the second generation of people who were displaced,&#13;
finding out what has happened to their way of life.       I'm not sure he has&#13;
done that for the Bank, but this is the kind of anthropological study that I&#13;
think you're implying the Bank should begin to do more of.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     That's correct.    These problems, needless to say, are not&#13;
restricted to Africa.       If I'm not mistaken, the TVA had similar experiences,&#13;
although in smaller proportions of course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       There was another case that comes to mind, of a very different nature,&#13;
also in Africa.       If I'm not mistaken, this was an irrigation project that&#13;
put canals on the ground to convey water from point A to the many other&#13;
points of use.       In that respect it was a very conventional engineering&#13;
problem and was solved that way.      At the time of its first evaluation,&#13;
shortly after construction was completed and the water first began to be&#13;
used--if my memory serves me right--the evaluations by the staff, the&#13;
borrower, and the evaluation staff concluded that this was a worthwhile&#13;
project,    ~hat   the monies had been properly spent, that the investments had&#13;
been well done and the benefit stream was more than likely to be realized.&#13;
It was one of those projects, however, that on revisiting five or ten years&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -44-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
later presented an utterly different picture, in two dimensions:     one, as&#13;
with the first project I mentioned, was the product of a failure to analyze&#13;
the social dynamics of the introduction of irrigated agriculture in this&#13;
particular area.    There was a question of group animosities, I don't recall&#13;
whether they were tribal or racial or ethnic, but it really doesn't matter.&#13;
The distribution of benefits was determined by who had access to irrigated&#13;
water.     And the differences in income levels between groups that resulted&#13;
from this so-called successful investment generated tensions between groups&#13;
of such an intensity as ultimately to frustrate the effective working of the&#13;
project, even to the point of warfare, with killings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It also changed employment patterns.     As output increased, people who&#13;
had been small owner-holders, or tenants, but basically self-employed, now&#13;
became agricultural laborers on irrigated farms, and that pattern of Â·changed&#13;
relationships generated stress.     So on that dimension things turned out&#13;
badly, and badly in ways that were quite unexpected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But the other unexpected thing, to make things worse, was that it turned&#13;
out after the fact that there had been some very serious deficiencies in the&#13;
technical work, a rather rare thing in the review of Bank projects.     The&#13;
very distinguished consultants who had been brought in had failed to&#13;
appreciate that the soils were peat-like in nature.     I'm not speaking as a&#13;
technician, but what I remember reading in the document was that after time&#13;
the weight of the water on these spongy soils caused the level of these&#13;
irrigation canals to sink, with the result that water was being conveyed to&#13;
farms where it couldn't be used because it had to be pumped vertically up in&#13;
order to get on the farm, an aspect of design that had never been&#13;
contemplated.    That changed the whole cost of the benefits.   The result was&#13;
a project that had looked good and had been evaluated as being good, but&#13;
turned out five or ten years later--whatever the interval was--to be a&#13;
disaster.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    May I ask, what is the practice of the Bank in going back five, ten&#13;
years later and looking at projects which presumably were finished?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    The practice is to test, in a selective manner, the early post-&#13;
evaluation conclusions.     As you may recall, the operations evaluation system&#13;
that now functions in the Bank generates a post-investment review, a&#13;
completion report, of every completed project, by collaborative efforts of&#13;
the Bank Operational staff and the borrower.     Fifty percent of those reports&#13;
are now reviewed by the independent Operations Evaluation staff.&#13;
Superimposed on that is a selective review of projects five to ten years&#13;
later, the purpose of which is to test some of those early conclusions, to&#13;
follow up more deeply on problems that had been identified or doubts that&#13;
had surfaced in the course of these earlier evaluations, and to provide&#13;
supplementary evidence about the validity of the conclusions and about the&#13;
adequacy of the learning process that has been generated by the evaluation&#13;
process.    It would be better, of course, if the second reviews covered a&#13;
larger proportion of the universe.     But there are always questions of costs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I suppose if a project went badly wrong, the government of the&#13;
country involved would complain to the Bank about it and the Bank would be&#13;
more likely in the case of those projects to have this secondary review five&#13;
to ten year later, would it not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I'm not sure that that sequence of events animated the work program&#13;
of these second reviews.    This is a sad comment to make, but most of the&#13;
governments didn't know what happened to their projects.     Most of them don't&#13;
know what happens to their projects, except as the Bank informs them,&#13;
because they don't have a comparable evaluation function in their own&#13;
administrative structure.     The people who work in an area will know, the&#13;
staff working on a particular Region will know what happened to particular&#13;
project; but the government as a government is unable in most cases to&#13;
benefit from the lessons of experience and apply them to selecting and&#13;
preparing similar future projects.&#13;

&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    Now, the errors I've described to you are very unusual, they're not&#13;
common.     But, sad to say, often errors of policy, errors of design and above&#13;
all errors of management can be found to be repeated mindlessly, simply&#13;
because of the absence of this feedback process.      One of the underlying&#13;
purposes of the Bank's evaluation system is to ensure that the institution&#13;
benefits from systematic feedback and, to the extent that these are&#13;
important projects of the Bank's members, that the members also benefit.&#13;
But the normal situation, of course, is that the Bank's projects are a very&#13;
tiny piece of the government's investment program, even in sectors of&#13;
prominence, and therefore that benefit of learning from the projects&#13;
supported by the Bank tends to be limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When I was Director General I made a very concerted effort to involve&#13;
governments in this process, to help them become beneficiaries of it&#13;
themselves, not simply in relationship to Bank projects, but in relationship&#13;
to the larger universe of their national     ~nvestments.   We had many&#13;
conversations and much interest expressed in principle, but the problems of&#13;
public management were felt to be less urgent here than elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I'm afraid there's not much to be seen on the ground by way of results,&#13;
although interestingly enough, quite independently of us, some thoughtful&#13;
governments have been doing things on their own:      South Korea, Tunisia,&#13;
Malaysia, Mexico, these governments in response to their own concerns about&#13;
the quality of their public investment programs, have set up evaluation&#13;
systems of some kind to find out what happened and to       ans~re   that there is&#13;
feedback.     That may be becoming more general, but certainly not at a pace&#13;
which you and I would consider adequate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You have suggested that doing some more work of an anthropological&#13;
nature is one outcome of the evaluation process.      Can you think of other&#13;
specific concrete changes in Bank procedures that have followed from the&#13;
evaluation process?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                  -47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     I would say two.    The most general one I would describe as systemic&#13;
rather than specific.     One result of the establishment of this process was&#13;
to change the perception of all staff, at all levels, of where their work&#13;
and their involvement with the investment cycle began and ended.         Typically&#13;
the active involvement of the Bank was felt to have ended when the&#13;
disbursements were completed and the investments were ended.         Supervision&#13;
then tended to become much more cursory and interest shifted to other active&#13;
projects.    That was normal, you might say, until the institution&#13;
internalized the obligation to be accountable to itself as well as to its&#13;
members about what happened to those investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I still remember Mr. McNamara, in the very early days, speaking to a&#13;
Board ever sensitive about increases in administrative costs, however&#13;
modest, and therefore skeptical about this operations evaluation innovation,&#13;
He said that whatever others felt, he felt he had an obligation to be&#13;
accountable to the Board for outcomes.         He, after all, recommended certain&#13;
projects on certain premises, all laid out in the documentation for these&#13;
proposals.     He felt, as the person who recommended these projects to the&#13;
Board, that he had an obligation to inform them of the result of these&#13;
investments, whether they and he jointly had been correct in approving them,&#13;
and whether the borrowers had been correct in assuming these financial&#13;
obligations in the light of what actually happened.         In my judgment this&#13;
position was impeccable.       But it took a while to permeate through the&#13;
establishment and affect the way people from the Board down to the most&#13;
junior Operational staff thought about their jobs.         The consequences were&#13;
far reaching in an environment in which day-to-day work tends to concentrate&#13;
people's attention on the loan commitment, which is where the major Bank&#13;
effort goes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now I will say, as I have said all the time, the Bank has always had&#13;
some form of self-evaluation, in the sense that it has always made major&#13;
expenditures on supervision.       The loan commitment was not the end of the&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -48-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
exercise, but the beginning.     The purpose of supervision was not simply to&#13;
ensure that obligations under the loan contracts were being honored, that&#13;
procurement was being done as agreed, that disbursements were being applied&#13;
for the purposes agreed, that fraud and corruption didn't exist or that all&#13;
reasonable precautions against its possibility were in place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    By far the major development purpose of supervision, and the&#13;
justification of its major cost, was to help the borrower address problems&#13;
encountered during the implementation process, in order to ensure that the&#13;
purposes and benefits of the project were realized.     One of the major&#13;
conclusions that emerged from the evaluation system, once it was in place&#13;
and once a body of evidence began to accumulate, was very interesting in&#13;
this regard.    It was that first of all the majority of the Bank's projects&#13;
turned out to be worthwhile, by criteria which were very explicit and&#13;
transparent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    And worthwhile not only in general but relative to the evaluation&#13;
made immediately at the end of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    That's correct.   And with the immediate test being reexamination of&#13;
the economic justification of the project.     Projects that for whatever&#13;
reason fell below a threshold were subjects of very special examination.&#13;
And so that is the broad conclusion.     But what was far more interesting, and&#13;
a great surprise to many people, was that the majority of those projects in&#13;
some significant ways turned out to be different from what was originally&#13;
initiated when the project was described in the appraisal report.     And in&#13;
many cases, very different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now here is a major lesson, one which has been discussed many times in&#13;
the Bank and continues to be discussed because it relates to the allocation&#13;
of effort and budget as between analysis before the investment decision and&#13;
analysis during and after the implementation.     Should the project be&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -49-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
considered as a blueprint, a set of goals vhich the borrover and Bank&#13;
jointly seek to realize?   There is no question that certain types of&#13;
projects, typically engineering-intensive infrastructure projects,Â·must by&#13;
definition be blueprint-type projects.       If they're not, the pover system&#13;
vill blov up, the bridge vill fall dovn, the roads vill collapse under the&#13;
traffic; these are obvious comments to make.       But beyond that, even&#13;
dimensions of those projects had surprises.      And vhen one moved into credit&#13;
projects, education projects, health projects, and other types of&#13;
agricultural projects, that concept of a very tightly defined and&#13;
pre-determined project vith a very precisely specified list of items in&#13;
vhich funds are to be disbursed and by vhen, begin to appear in a slightly&#13;
different light.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It became less clear than it did from the other projects that deviations&#13;
from the original plan vere necessarily alvays bad.       Often they reflected&#13;
timely, bold and innovative management in response to unexpected problems.&#13;
The vorld is full of surprises.     Projects are developed typically in an&#13;
environment of uncertainty, and some cases major uncertainty.       In some cases&#13;
the uncertainty is even of an engineering nature, and the costs of&#13;
eliminating uncertainty simply become unvarranted, like determining the&#13;
conditions that vill be encountered vhen you tunnel through a mountain.            You&#13;
can invest so much in borings, but beyond a certain point there are risks&#13;
that have to be assumed and probabilities that have to be estimated.          In&#13;
most cases they turn out right, but in some cases they don't.      We have all&#13;
kinds of experience of that sort.     â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Well, the general comment to be derived from all this is that the&#13;
ex ante analysis and the   ~   ante blueprints are useful as guides, but&#13;
they're not necessarily the right benchmarks against vhich     ~post       results&#13;
are to be measured.   Deviations, of course, must be identified and analyzed&#13;
but deviations are not in and of themselves the measure of all that vent&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -50-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
wrong.     These were things that had to be learned.   Once that kind of a&#13;
finding becomes internalized, people go about their ex ante analysis a&#13;
little differently, or at least they should.     And they think again about the&#13;
balance between incremental effort to refine the analysis before the&#13;
decision versus incremental effort--and by that I mean incremental&#13;
administrative costs--in the supervision process in which Bank staff and&#13;
borrowers collaborate to solve problems as they surface.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This is a very important result of the fact that outcomes were now being&#13;
made known, being disseminated in what as far as was humanly possible was a&#13;
non-adversary, non-provocative way, for the purpose of expressing an&#13;
institutional accountability to its owners and its clients and for the&#13;
purpose of having an instrument that made possible, encouraged, and provoked&#13;
learning from experience within the Bank.     That has been for me the major&#13;
achievement.    This doesn't mean to say it didn't happen before, but it&#13;
happened in different ways; it was not generalized institutionally and its&#13;
fruits resided in pockets of the Bank rather than being made transparent.&#13;
Certainly they were not shared with the President and the Board and the&#13;
members of the Bank except in the most dramatic of circumstances.      I think&#13;
it's a great credit to the institution that this initiative came from the&#13;
top and was established--with some frictions of course inevitable, but not&#13;
major ones--and exists and is now part of the institutional furniture.       No&#13;
one thinks twice about it anymore, even though individual products of the&#13;
process still provide occasion for lively debate about differences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Are there any generalizations that can be drawn as to the&#13;
particular types of projects which consistently turn out five, ten years&#13;
hence to have a higher benefit-cost ratio on the one hand and those kinds or&#13;
types of projects which turn out to have a lower benefit-cost ratio than&#13;
have been expected at the time of the project?     I would have thought, for&#13;
example, to illustrate the question, that some education projects might in&#13;
ten years turn out to have a higher benefit cost ratio than had immediately&#13;
seemed likely when the project was initiated?     That may be very naive.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -51-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Not at all.    I'm smiling at the question simply because you picked&#13;
the one illustration where the economic analysis does not carry to that&#13;
quantitative conclusion, and never has, simply because there's never been&#13;
agreement as to what is a useful way to quantify benefits in the field of&#13;
education,    There are many ways of doing it, and there are all kinds of&#13;
people outside the Bank who do very elaborate evaluation studies which&#13;
reflect estimates of benefits like incremental income streams and all sorts&#13;
of other effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But in the development of a process which had a certain amount of&#13;
contention associated with it, there was consensus, including the Board,&#13;
that perhaps this was not an area in which quantitative refinement was a&#13;
fruitful thing to follow.    Which doesn't mean to say that the ex ante&#13;
analysis, the project appraisals, and their evaluations after the fact, did&#13;
not seek in a qualitative way to render judgment about the probable benefits&#13;
of these projects, which could be many kinds.     But the findings were&#13;
explicit more in the negative sense, in the sense of examining cases where&#13;
clearly what had been described as probable benefits were unlikely to be&#13;
realized, either because physical facilities were not developed as planned,&#13;
or because the throughput of students did not develop as planned, for&#13;
whatever reason.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Each of these cases would then lead to a whole series of subsidiary&#13;
questions about why, and what lessons were there to be learned from it.      Or&#13;
perhaps there were problems because for a variety of reasons facilities were&#13;
not replicated within the national system, which led to. other series of&#13;
interesting questions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In some cases this offered very direct commentary about benefits.       For&#13;
example, you might find vocational schools whose products turned out not to&#13;
be interesting candidates for the employers who were their original&#13;
proponents.   This was helpful because it provided very clear commentary&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                              -52-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER)&#13;
about the usefulness of these schools.     Or the reverse, that schools that&#13;
had vocational elements added to formerly wholly academic curricula were&#13;
replicated because the demand for these students turned out to be so great&#13;
that the ministry began to redesign new schools across the country.        This,&#13;
too, would be a very eloquent commentary on benefits, even though it did not&#13;
take the normal form of an estimate of costs and benefits through time,&#13;
translated into an economic rate of return figure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Thinking back now to documents that I read some years ago, the&#13;
surprising point relates to the rapid expansion of Bank agricultural&#13;
lending, which took place in the early 1970s when the numbers became very&#13;
dramatic--a start which, by the way, began in the Woods era but was simply&#13;
extended in scale under Mr. McNamara, there was much skepticism expressed at&#13;
the Board, certainly by some Executive Directors, including the then-U.S.&#13;
Executive Director, that all of this was likely to be misplaced.     The&#13;
intentions were noble, he felt, but the probable results were dubious and he&#13;
for one couldn't wait to see what the Bank's experience with these projects&#13;
would be because he had real doubts.     He and others of like mind had real&#13;
doubts that this was an appropriate initiative for the Bank, not because the&#13;
rural development dimension of agricultural development was not important,&#13;
indeed urgent, for these societies, but because he had real doubts about&#13;
whether the Bank, headquartered in Washington, working in societies that it&#13;
didn't know, confronting problems that it might not be well informed about,&#13;
would be able to do as good a job as he felt it had done to that date on the&#13;
more conventional infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So when the returns started coming in, they were looked at with much&#13;
interest.   And I recall annual reviews of project performance audit reports&#13;
that, in commenting on the rapidly increasing inventory of completed&#13;
agricultural.projects, made a point of saying that not only have the&#13;
majority of these projects turned out to be as good or better than expected,&#13;
but that with the unhappy exception of certain African initiatives, the&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -53-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
returns were turning out to be better than"those in other sectors.     In other&#13;
words, it was a very interesting and eloquent commentary on the original&#13;
fears.     That was an important finding, and it tended to contribute even more&#13;
to the relaxed, professional environment in which proposals were considered&#13;
rather than the emotional environment with which they were greeted at the&#13;
beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But there were others in which I recall now had an opposite consequence.&#13;
This is an incidental comment but nonetheless may be interesting.     Yesterday&#13;
we were talking about my own particular experience in my Projects director&#13;
phase, when there was a concerted effort to enlarge and strengthen the&#13;
economic analysis of investments to complement all the other work that had&#13;
long been done in the Bank.     That was a period in which I was urged to do&#13;
some special work about the economic analysis of telecommunications&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I must say I resisted the effort.     The returns were very high in those&#13;
cases where special efforts had been made to estimate them.     And yet, there&#13;
was an enormous resistance to investing in telecommunications by certain&#13;
people in the Bank, and the share of the Bank's investments there were&#13;
declining.    Much of it was of the usual concern:   We don't want to waste&#13;
money in telephones because we all know that telephones are instruments of&#13;
the rich and the people who use them are just idle ladies who talk to their&#13;
idle friends about idle subjects and there's no social merit to these&#13;
projects.     And if they can pay for them, that doesn't prove anything because&#13;
they're just the rich and investment funds should be concentrated on more&#13;
needy things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The staff argued often that indeed there may be some of that, but such&#13;
surveys as were done in response to that particular concern revealed that&#13;
eighty percent, to use an order of magnitude, or a very large proportion of&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -54-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
the use of the telephone system was for business purposes.      Some very&#13;
elaborate estimates were done about the costs of not having telephones in&#13;
which central communications had to be done by messenger, which took time,&#13;
which had a cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Or mail, which had a longer time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Longer time and larger costs.    It's easy to imagine the nature of&#13;
that debate.    I mention it simply because that experience reinforced in my&#13;
mind a prejudice--and I confess that it is a prejudice--that these arguments&#13;
can be pursued at a rational level only up to a point.     The high returns of&#13;
telecommunications didn't persuade the doubters in any way.      Doubters here,&#13;
and more importantly, doubters in the governments who no doubt were often&#13;
responding to political tugs-of-war about the allocation of scarce&#13;
investment resources, and who had to respond to this image of&#13;
telecommunications serving the most well-to-do in their society, these&#13;
doubters were voicing a real concern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Over the years the resolution of that issue did not take place at the&#13;
level of persuading skeptics that the high returns were real, but rather by&#13;
responding to the concerns of the skeptics, which were real.      This included&#13;
reshaping telephone investments to ensure that every village had a&#13;
telephone, even though there was only one, so that it could connect up to&#13;
the larger system; ensuring that the structure of user charges were such not&#13;
to subsidize those who could best afford to pay, but that the charges and&#13;
new connections distinguished appropriately between those who needed and&#13;
those who didn't urgently need telephones where there were large waiting&#13;
lists; and, most importantly, ensuring that the structure of the system's&#13;
finances and prices captured the economic benefits through the rates, and&#13;
generated surpluses for the rest of the public sector.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -55-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    In other words, the nature of the debate changed.     That was interesting&#13;
because this was an appropriate evolution of an economic analysis of this&#13;
particular activity, which started as concern for the merits of the&#13;
investment and convincing doubters that we're dealing with 70 percent&#13;
returns, not 12 percent returns, and therefore you shouldn't object, but&#13;
which in fact evolved in quite different ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    That's a fascinating story.   Has the Bank been successful in&#13;
tailoring rate structures in telecommunications so as to capture the&#13;
surplus?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    It has tried.   I suspect it has tried more easily and succeeded&#13;
more easily in telecommunications than elsewhere simply because these have&#13;
typically been surplus generating services.     By and large you may say the&#13;
story of the Bank's concern with user charges in general has not been a&#13;
happy one, in the sense that the results on a narrow post-evaluation results&#13;
versus intentions have not been realized to the degree that was expected.&#13;
This doesn't mean to say that it does not remain a central     concern.    It has&#13;
now been elevated to the level of policy, not just with borrowers but with&#13;
governments through policy-oriented lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Those old stories open a window onto a much larger set of concerns about&#13;
fiscal policy, and pricing of services, that have become a central concern&#13;
of policy-based lending.    Concern for the adequacy of user charges has been&#13;
viewed by some of the Bank's critics as confirmation that the Bank had a&#13;
narrow banker's concern for financial outcomes to protect the repayment of&#13;
its loans.    That is a caricature of the real concern: User charges affect&#13;
the demand for investment, and the generation of surplus in particular areas&#13;
of the public sector and thus the larger finances of the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    It's also a fairly efficient way of testing financial and economic&#13;
feasibilities of particular investments.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -56-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Absolutely.   I'll refer to another case simply to illustrate the&#13;
larger point.    In my Latin American years, in the days when I was a loan&#13;
officer and then division chief for Mexico, I had found myself deeply&#13;
involved for a period in the Bank's lending to the electric power sector.&#13;
The client was the power system of Mexico.       Our concern related to the&#13;
design of system development; the projects were time slices of this program.&#13;
There were two issues of debate.    One related to frequency integration.&#13;
Mexico City was one frequency; the rest of the country was another.      And&#13;
therefore you had to have separate generating systems, separate motors and&#13;
all kinds of power-using equipment, at terrible economic costs for the&#13;
society, because of the duplication involved.      The long term issue was how&#13;
fast can frequency unification be realized, what kind of investments were&#13;
necessary to help realize them--and we helped finance those investments--and&#13;
how would the society recompense those who had to incur the private costs of&#13;
reconverting from one frequency to another.      That was one set of issues.&#13;
Along with that, of course, there was system planning of the conventional&#13;
sort in order to minimize the investment costs for meeting a particular&#13;
demand for power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The parallel issues had to do with the finances of the power system and&#13;
the classic issues of rates.    There were rate covenants having to do with&#13;
return on investment for a period, and then there were rate covenants having&#13;
to do with proportion of investment generated internally as another.      All of&#13;
the Bank's experience, good and bad, with that aspect of power financing was&#13;
embodied in this particular covenant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Well, many years later I found on my desk a review of the twelfth or the&#13;
fourteenth power loan to Mexico.    As I had now been out of that area fifteen&#13;
years or more, I read it with much interest against my recollection of those&#13;
years.    I found two very interesting things.    One was that all of the system&#13;
development objectives had by now long been realized.      Frequency unification&#13;
had taken place, the planning had been strengthened.      There were problems,&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -57-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
of course.     Efficiency could have been increased and transmission losses&#13;
could have been reduced and so on, but nevertheless the things that were&#13;
central to the Bank's discussions with the client in that area of concern&#13;
were by and large achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And then I read about the other point.       This particular loan had a rate&#13;
covenant that required the borrower to set prices at a level to generate not&#13;
less than 33 percent of investments expected for the next three years, or&#13;
something like that.    And what had happened?    The report said that not only&#13;
did the borrower not generate 33 percent of its investments, or some figure&#13;
less, it generated a negative figure.     It was borrowing from the rest of the&#13;
public sector to finance operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Dear me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I was shocked.   Now the explanation was very simple.   There are&#13;
political cycles in Mexico.     This particular review occurred during a period&#13;
in which the government decided not to increase power rates during a period&#13;
when costs had been increasing, above all, fuel charges which had been&#13;
increasing dramatically in the latter part of the 1970s.      That deficit was&#13;
made good some years later, so in part the finding was an accident of&#13;
timing; we happened to be looking at that particular period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But there is a general comment which I think is worth making because it&#13;
applies to very many of the Bank's projects where user charges are&#13;
important, and provide independent, incidental commentary on policies in&#13;
general.     Notwithstanding the Bank's enormous struggle and effort to define&#13;
a goal, to register it in a solemn contractual undertaking, and to supervise&#13;
it, here we have very dramatic evidence of the fact that when push comes to&#13;
shove, these goals may not be realized, for the pressures to realize them or&#13;
not realize them are qualitatively different than the pressures to have&#13;
rational system development in the technical sense.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -58-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   When you say may not be realized, you mean may not be realized by&#13;
the borrowing government who is in charge of actually implementing the&#13;
project, or the Bank itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   I don't mean may not be realized in the sense of it may not be&#13;
understood; I mean may not be realized in the sense it may not be achieved.&#13;
The results may not be there.     They may solemnly undertake to agree to&#13;
certain things and then may not do them.        Not because the obligation was&#13;
undertaken lightheartedly or without serious intent, but that given the&#13;
nature of the policy process, including things as sensitive as user&#13;
charges--and for user charges you can read all kinds of other issues--when&#13;
the time came to adjust them in response to events that required adjustment,&#13;
be they increases in fossil fuel charges or whatever, another calculus,&#13;
frequently political, came into play.        The costs of, the benefits of&#13;
responding to the covenant, which had been mutually agreed upon, which was&#13;
sensible and serious and had its purpose, were perceived to not be&#13;
sufficient to warrant the political costs of responding to that covenant at&#13;
that particular time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   I think it's probably true, is it not, that some governments faced&#13;
with inflation find it difficult to raise the prices of the products, the&#13;
services that they may be selling to the public as fast as inflation, which&#13;
only adds to the size of the government deficit, which only contributes to&#13;
further inflation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Absolutely right.    Now one is reading very commonly about the need&#13;
to re-examine the premises of state enterprises simply because in some cases&#13;
their costs are proving to be unsupportable for the society.        Sadly, in many&#13;
of these places this has taken the overtones of a debate about ideology,&#13;
about the pros and cons of public versus private ownership.        But that's not&#13;
the issue, certainly that's not the issue as perceived from here, and that's&#13;
not the essential issue that these countries face.        But the debate gets all&#13;
wrapped up with that.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -59-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
    This leads me to one incidental comment, if I may interject here, about&#13;
the Woods period.      One of the distinctive recollections that I have about&#13;
that period is that that President stood up and declared to his Board and to&#13;
the Bank's membership that the Bank would no longer be concerned with the&#13;
ownership of the development finance companies and the industrial&#13;
corporations to which it lent; it would be concerned with their efficiency&#13;
and the quality of their management.      The Bank would be as ready to lend to&#13;
publicly-owned investment banks as to privately-owned development banks,&#13;
which, if I am not mistaken, was a break from the Bank's expressed policy in&#13;
this regard in earlier years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I think it was.    But is it not also true that during the Woods&#13;
administration development banks were in effect put into the IFC&#13;
[International Finance Cooperation] and by that device they became in effect&#13;
banks that had to be privately owned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    For the IFC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    But I don't think that that, by implication, denied to the World&#13;
Bank the right to make development bank loans to development banks which&#13;
were not IFC candidates because they were not privately owned.      I think&#13;
you're right in that--Bill [William] Diamond can speak to that with&#13;
authority, of course.     My recollection was that Woods broke the taboo by&#13;
saying we will not any longer rule out publicly-owned development banks as&#13;
our clients.      It was in that period that the World Bank began to lend to&#13;
publicly owned development banks.     Bill can speak to the record because he&#13;
knows the cases.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -60-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, I appreciate your introducing the subject of the Woods years&#13;
because there are a few things I specifically would like to ask about that&#13;
period.    One follows directly on from that.   I heard it said that Woods&#13;
insisted that the Bank should not attempt to make loans for projects if it&#13;
was clear that those particular projects could, and in the nature of things&#13;
probably would, be privately financed, be financed from outside the Bank.&#13;
So that in the case of Algeria, for example, the Bank declined to make loans&#13;
to the Algerian Government for the development of petroleum resources,&#13;
partly on the grounds that there were plenty of international petroleum&#13;
companies that stood ready to finance these kinds of activities.     Is this an&#13;
issue you care to comment about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I can't respond with authority on that.   My sense is that what&#13;
you're attributing to Woods had always been the posture of the Bank, and not&#13;
something that he introduced.    The Bank's self-perception, which had its&#13;
roots in the Articles of Agreement, was that it was a lender of last resort.&#13;
It tended to translate that in ways which were evident.    And petroleum, in&#13;
those days, was one of the evident cases in which the alternatives were&#13;
there.    We don't have to go back that far because the Bank's entry into the&#13;
petroleum financing business was the subject of much dispute in much more&#13;
recent years, with petroleum loans being regularly and systematically the&#13;
subject of negative comment from major shareholders on those grounds&#13;
particularly.    What's happened the last few years I don't know. So what you&#13;
say doesn't surprise me, but my sense was that that was no major innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    No, it wasn't extraordinary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    Not like the DFC [development finance company] initiative, which&#13;
was a major innovation.    But I remember the innovations of the Woods period,&#13;
the publicly-owned DFC being one, the entry into education and agriculture&#13;
on a scale quite different from the past being the other two, which doesn't&#13;
mean to say that these were virgin fields for the Bank.    But nevertheless&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                               -61-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
Woods began to change the rate at which commitments were made in those&#13;
fields.    This was very interesting, considering who Mr. Woods was and where&#13;
he came from, that he had the least inhibitions compared to many who had&#13;
spoken otherwise on these subjects, the least of any to say these are proper&#13;
areas for this Bank to become involved in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I recall in the very earliest days of the Bank--when for me to go to a&#13;
Board meeting was a very rare event--being present in the early 1950s when a&#13;
European Executive Director spoke with great force against a suggestion that&#13;
the Bank should make loans for municipal water.     That was not productive, he&#13;
argued, that was a consumption good.    It was perfectly all right to provide&#13;
water for cattle and for irrigation but for human consumption, that was not&#13;
the Bank's business.    How far we have come since then!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    And Mr. Woods in a sense enlarged that area, making it not only&#13;
respectable but urgent that we become much more actively involved in social&#13;
fields, education being the major one that I can recall, and in agriculture.&#13;
And I'm not speaking about agriculture infrastructure like irrigation, which&#13;
had long been an obvious area of activity, but agricultural credit,&#13;
marketing and other things of this kind.     That's my principal recollection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The other thing I remember, of a very different nature--and all of this&#13;
is distant because I didn't have any direct interaction with him--was that&#13;
he managed to generate antipathy in some quarters by his manner.     Whether&#13;
this was a fair reaction or not I can't say, but certainly I would not&#13;
measure that on the same scale as his positive achievements to enlarge the&#13;
agenda of work of the Bank.    In that sense he really was the pathfinder for&#13;
the McNamara era, which essentially changed those things in scale and&#13;
enlarged the agenda in the field of agriculture with its focus on poverty,&#13;
&amp;#12;~I~R                                  -62-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[~INER]&#13;
&#13;
and added a social dimension to all of these things.     But the original&#13;
seeds, the original innovative changes, in my recollection, had their roots&#13;
in the Woods era.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It was very sad in retrospect to recall that, when he left, he left in&#13;
an environment in which the U.S. markets were closed to the Bank by the&#13;
major shareholder.   I presume this is where personal chemistry was a factor,&#13;
but I don't know the facts and I've never made an effort to inquire.        I&#13;
simply recall a major loan to Mexico City for its municipal water supply, a&#13;
major water conveyance initiative.     That's a perennial problem in that&#13;
particular city, because of its size but also because of its geography.         The&#13;
water has to come from very far away, it has to be pumped up and therefore&#13;
it represents a major investment.     It had to be postponed because, when the&#13;
time came to commit at the end of the whole preparation phase, the Bank&#13;
found itself without the resources in hand to commit, because of being&#13;
                                                    I&#13;
&#13;
barred from the U.S. market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was this a shortage of IDA funds or a shortage of Bank funds?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~INER:    No, a shortage of Bank funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   And it was because the United States Government denied the Bank&#13;
permission to float bonds on the New York investment market?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
~INER:    That's my recollection.    This was a vary rare experience in the&#13;
Bank's history.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   And you think that it is partly because of some antagonism&#13;
expressed or unreal between the Treasury Department and Woods in&#13;
particular?.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -63-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   It may have been.    I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   I understand.    I was asking for perception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   That was my sense of the gossip.      I relay it in the form of a&#13;
question to be pursued further by people who are in a better position to&#13;
have known what happened at that time.       I don't.     It was not the first and&#13;
certainly not the last time in which Bank Presidents have been in that kind&#13;
of a stressful relationship with the Treasury.          But it was the only occasion&#13;
that I'm aware of--there may have been others--where a major commitment&#13;
process was interrupted for such reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Yes, that's new and very interesting information, the specific case&#13;
of the project itself being delayed.     I think there were a number of IDA&#13;
projects which had to be delayed in this time and subsequently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:   Sadly, that's the very familiar experience of IDA, but it's very&#13;
unusual for the Bank.     But the replenishment problems of IDA have had a&#13;
pattern in which the cycle of operational work continued, with the knowledge&#13;
and agreement of the Board, but with commitments simply piling up in reserve&#13;
until the funds became available.    And so, sadly, this history is one of&#13;
triennial delays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Would you care to comment on the evolution of the economic work,&#13;
per se, in the Bank in the Woods year?       There was a very substantial&#13;
increase in the number of economists during that time period.         And 1:hen of&#13;
course the work of the economic committee was increased with various things&#13;
being added, like people from the Fund being invited to participate, in an&#13;
attempt to have the economic advisers from the various Area departments&#13;
participate in the work of the Economic Committee.         You were an economic&#13;
adviser yourself at that point.&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -64-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Yes, I am trying to think when Irving Friedman came to the Bank â&#128;¢.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     He came in the summer of 1964.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     Was he brought by Woods?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     That coincided.   Well then, you're absolutely right.   This was a&#13;
period in which there was a very concerted effort to raise the profile, the&#13;
volume, and the quantity of economic work, which does not mean to say that&#13;
there had not been good work before.      But here was The Economic Adviser to&#13;
the President, who was being called that for the first time; who was the&#13;
Chairman of an Economic Committee, which had existed in other forms before&#13;
but had now been elevated in level and significance; and who made a&#13;
concerted effort to have a more rigorous forward planning of economic work,&#13;
a more deliberate staffing of economic work, and have that work better&#13;
inform and affect the Bank's own operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The evolution is an interesting one.      In the earliest years of the Bank&#13;
there was a series of major country economic missions, often jointly with&#13;
the country, often by outsiders, or with outsiders and almost always leading&#13;
to published reports.     There's a file of these major economic reports that&#13;
go back to the early 1950s, which were fundamentally reviews of country&#13;
prospects, national investment programs, and often exercises in designing&#13;
with the country the first coherent public investment programs that they&#13;
ever had.     It was a form of Bank technical assistance to countries.    I&#13;
describe them this way to separate them from the rest of the Bank's economic&#13;
work, which is much more continuing, internal to the Bank, and more modest.&#13;
This other work had as its purpose I would say--and I did this for quite a&#13;
number of years--to inform the management and Board as to what was happening&#13;
in the country, but basically to provide assurance that the decision to&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -65-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
lend was a reasonable one against the economic prospects of the country.&#13;
This was the creditworthiness judgment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Economic work, which was conceived of as developing answers to the&#13;
creditworthiness question, was really quite different from economic work&#13;
which was conceived of--as it was later--not just to answer that, but much&#13;
more to answer questions about the adequacy of the public investment&#13;
program, the adequacy of the financing program for those investments, its&#13;
coherence with the national financial picture, and what issues did all of&#13;
those things raise for the Bank in terms of what it should lend for, how&#13;
much it should lend, what issues it should seek to engage itself in with its&#13;
client.     Economic dialogue with the members was not part and parcel of what&#13;
I would call the early creditworthiness question generation of economic&#13;
work.     The economic dialogue came later with a much expanded agenda of&#13;
economic work.     It had always been done in some parts of the Bank; it had&#13;
always been done by some individuals in the Bank, but it wasn't systemic.&#13;
I suspect--! can't say this for a fact--but I suspect it became systemic&#13;
under Woods, and evolved further since.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It is still evolving.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A major task of the Bank in the foreseeable future, apparently, is going&#13;
to be to work much more closely with member governments, particularly those&#13;
having large debts, to develop fiscal, monetary and trade policies which&#13;
will go some distance towards solving the debt problems.      That gives the&#13;
Bank an enormous responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     It is still evolving.   But this is not all that different from the&#13;
kind of work I recall being involved in in Colombia in the 1960s under&#13;
Alter's direction.     We raised these same questions, in this case looking at&#13;
debt by anticipation to prevent the kinds of problems that so many countries&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                 -66-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER)&#13;
are now suffering from.     We engaged the country on the same agenda of&#13;
issues, and they became operational.      This is the distinguishing feature.&#13;
They became operational in the sense that the three major lenders to&#13;
Colombia--the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and USAID, which&#13;
had the big pot of non-project money--jointly negotiated a memorandum of&#13;
understanding on economic policy, with the World Bank fronting for the&#13;
group.     That was an annual exercise.   It was very interesting because this&#13;
was really an SAL-type operation, but in another sense it was much more&#13;
ambitious because it embraced the totality of lending by the three agencies&#13;
and defined the context in which all three would pursue their separate&#13;
operational programs.     This was an experience that was interesting in two&#13;
respects, if I may indulge in retrospect by virtue of my years â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    By virtue of your wisdom.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ to show that indeed there are operational antecedents to what&#13;
younger staff, unfamiliar with much of the Bank's history, think are the&#13;
innovation of policy-based lending today, although it is perfectly true that&#13;
the instrumental farm of that lending is now different.      We were engaged&#13;
with the country on the whole agenda of issues, including things like tariff&#13;
and exchange rates, which were deemed by all concerned to be essential to&#13;
the development of non-traditional exports for that country.      Coffee&#13;
dominated export earnings and was subject to crop cycles and market cycles.&#13;
The growth potential had to be found elsewhere.      There was a nascent&#13;
industrial sector there and all of the issues related to an outward-oriented&#13;
development, developing not only supply capacity but markets for it.       These&#13;
are the issues that are now central in these discussions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Did you yourself ever work with Drag [Dragoslav] Avramovic on&#13;
commodity questions in the 1950s or 1960s?&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                    -67-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     No.    We were colleagues.    In fact we shared a wall; we had adjacent&#13;
offices for many years, but we. didn't work together on the same problem.           We&#13;
had related but very different career tracks, he being much more special&#13;
study oriented.       As my interest developed, I found myself veering much more&#13;
towards the operational expression of these same issues, which you can&#13;
follow in a very different track.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, sir, I've kept you talking, so to speak, for an hour and a&#13;
half today and for two hours yesterday.          I think that's a pretty conclusive&#13;
interview.        I shouldn't stop, though, without asking if there are any&#13;
questions that I should have asked and I haven't asked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:     None that I can thing of.      The points that I wanted to make that&#13;
were not made yesterday, as I reflected on our conversation last night, I've&#13;
made.     They had to do basically with my sense of the innovative aspect of&#13;
the Woods regime and supplementary commentary on project analysis in the&#13;
1960s.     They've now been made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I compliment you on the gentle and yet very effective way in which you&#13;
lead this interview.       It's been a great pleasure for me to participate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Are there some points of your career in the Bank which stand out as&#13;
being particularly fruitful and happy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    They've all been happy.       I sometimes wonder if being as Pollyannish&#13;
in retrospect as I find myself means there's something lacking in my&#13;
critical faculties, although I think not judging by the way other people&#13;
complain about the questions I raise when I review things for them.           No,&#13;
when I left along with two other vice presidential colleagues, the three of&#13;
us were guests at the farewell dinner which Mr. Clausen gave, together with&#13;
the Board.    We were each asked to get up and make a little speech, not&#13;
surprisingly with no notice at all.         I still recall telling the people then&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                -68-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER)&#13;
what I thought was appropriate and certainly deeply felt, that I considered&#13;
it a privilege to have been able to look back on the 33 years and 3 days&#13;
that I spent with the Bank, and to be able to say after the event that,&#13;
knowing all the warts as I now knew them, I still wouldn't hesitate to do it&#13;
all over again if I had the chance.     I wished others the same, _the ability&#13;
to be able to say the same thing when their turn came.       To have been able to&#13;
have such diverse and stimulating experience within an organization, as the&#13;
organization itself evolved, was really a very rare and happy thing to look&#13;
back on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I consider myself very lucky to have been involved in country economic&#13;
work at both the doing level and at the management level; in country&#13;
operations work at the doing level and at the management level; in project&#13;
work at the management level; and regional operations work, which is a&#13;
combination of the program and project functions, at the management level;&#13;
and then for my sins to have been called upon for a number of years to make&#13;
transparent all of the horrors and the lessons and the achievements, and to&#13;
help develop an operations evaluation process that is now solidly part of&#13;
the Bank's bureaucratic furniture.    All of this was really a great privilege&#13;
to have been part of.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    And through all this, to be an economist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    And through all of that to be an economist.     Some of these episodes&#13;
were because of and some of the episodes were in spite of.       You will, as an&#13;
economist, be amused when I tell you the following story which crosses my&#13;
mind:     Shortly before I left I was invited by the then-Vice President in&#13;
charge of the Central Projects Staff [Warren Baum), now the Operational&#13;
Policy Staff, to join a retreat with all of senior staff to reflect on&#13;
things they had yet to learn.    Many of those people were old colleagues of&#13;
mine, in fact I knew most all of them.       But as I was speaking ex officio&#13;
from a different role, I didn't fall for the bait.       I said that I still had&#13;
&amp;#12;WEINER                                  -69-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WEINER]&#13;
to learn far more than they would ever have to learn in their respective&#13;
fields of expertise, so I was not about to preach to them in their own&#13;
particular fields of expertise.       I concentrated instead on making one&#13;
general comment, the comment we talked about earlier, about the project as a&#13;
blueprint versus the project as a set of goals.       The comment has since been&#13;
reflected in the OED review of the Bank's experience with loan covenants, in&#13;
endless micro reports about struggling with the borrower about minutiae and&#13;
losing sight of the main goal, or in designing for the wrong thing and being&#13;
too inflexible in supervision.       The highlight of that discussion was when&#13;
one of the participants, a senior engineering advisor in his particular&#13;
field, stood up and said, "You're talking just like an engineer."           For him,&#13;
that was the highest compliment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Of course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEINER:    I accepted it as such.     As I mentioned yesterday, one of my&#13;
particularly delightful periods with Bank--although not the only one by any&#13;
means--was that period in which I was working directly in collaboration with&#13;
technical staff and was responsible for what they did.       I found that&#13;
interesting because it confirmed what I had felt before, that too often&#13;
economists, by training, view the world through a narrow prism.          They are&#13;
not taught to integrate the fruits of other disciplines into that&#13;
perspective.     Engineers are taught engineering economics.       The so-called&#13;
technical people often have insights which can illuminate micro-economic&#13;
issues that economists may fail to appreciate.       That's sad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I'm not sure that the Bank as an institution has done that much better&#13;
than other institutions in effecting intellectual integration or horizontal&#13;
communication.    The engineer and the economist were too often seen as&#13;
viewing the same thing from opposing, competing, noncongruent perspectives.&#13;
They should be complementary.       When not complementary, one should ask why?&#13;
&amp;#12;        WEINER                                -70-&#13;
'   l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        [WEINER)&#13;
        Are there real issues?     Economic issues in the engineering design, or vice&#13;
        versa.     That was what was so exciting about that particular period, to seek&#13;
        as best one could to integrate the technical and the economic analyses in a&#13;
        product in which the different disciplines contributed to a common end and&#13;
        in which the disciplines spoke to each other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            I was very struck as I came to know people better, to realize that some&#13;
        engineers who are still with the Bank, who had a self-perception as being&#13;
        just good engineers, which they were, thought of themselves as being as far&#13;
        removed from economics as anybody could possibly be.     But in the application&#13;
        of their disciplines, they made major economic contributions to their&#13;
        clients by saying that you can build this system for a third of the cost if&#13;
        you do this instead of that, if you take that alternative rather than&#13;
        another one.    In other words, their engineering economics had major&#13;
        consequences.     They were looking at the project as engineers, and couldn't&#13;
        have been less interested in the estimation of economic rates of return, and&#13;
        even less about other aspects of the formal analysis that the project&#13;
        economists did.    Yet they were making major economic contributions through&#13;
        their own discipline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            That bridging of the intellectual barriers that we all    ~arried   with us&#13;
        from our respective training was stimulating.     It offers interesting&#13;
        commentary also about the universities, but that's something that you're in&#13;
        a better position to follow up on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        OLIVER:    I think that's a marvelous story and moral to bring us to the end.&#13;
        And I appreciate very much your time.     I know that future people who read&#13;
        your conversation will find it very fruitful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        WEINER:    Thank you, thank you very much.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Mervyn L. Weiner held on July 16, 1986
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In July 1986, Mervyn L. Weiner was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1951 to 1984, Mr. Weiner worked in the
            following areas: as a junior staff member conducting general
            economic studies beginning in 1951; in the Central America
            and the Caribbean department as a country economist and loan
            officer (1950s-1960s); in the Central America and the
            Caribbean department as chief economist for public utilities
            (1969-1972); in the projects department as director for the
            Asia region (1972-1974) and as vice president for the South
            Asia region (1974-1975); and in the operations evaluation
            department as director-general (1975-1984). He spent over 15
            years on project focused in the Latin America and Caribbean
            (LAC) region. His transcript concerns local currency loans,
            fiscal policy, program lending, and government investment
            programs for South Korea, Tunisia, Malaysia, Colombia, and
            Mexico. He also discusses the problems at the World Bank
            with intellectual integration or horizontal communication
            amongst staff.
