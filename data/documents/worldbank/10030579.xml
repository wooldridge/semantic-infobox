                 50 children die before reaching the age of five.             100,000Children&#13;
                                                                              every year,&#13;
                 According the Ministry of Health, one of the causes is&#13;
                 diarrhea.&#13;
                    Diarrhea occurs when our stomachs are infected with&#13;
                 sewage-borne microbes. It is not surprising that most cases&#13;
                                                                              die of diarrhea&#13;
                 of diarrhea occur where sanitation facilities are inadequate.&#13;
                 Diarrhea also strikes people who do not care about health&#13;
                 and health behavior. Have you ever seen a child defecating&#13;
                 in a ditch? That's another example of behavior that results&#13;
                 in the deaths of thousands of children each year.&#13;

&#13;
                            In the last 30 years, the government has spent only&#13;
                            around 820 million US dollars on the sanitation. That's&#13;
                            the equivalent of only 200 rupiahs a year for every man,&#13;
                            woman and child in Indonesia. A figure far short of the 47&#13;
                            thousand rupiahs needed per person per year!&#13;
                               The budget for the sanitation sector is tiny, especially&#13;
                            if compared with the budget for the water supply sector,&#13;
                            which was more than 6 billion US dollars for the same&#13;
                            period. Yet as far as public health is concerned, these two&#13;
                            sectors are closely interdependent.&#13;
                               Is this small budget for the sanitation sector a cause of&#13;
                            the high mortality rate of under-5s? Perhaps, perhaps not.&#13;

                         sector.The number of existing facilities is insufficient.Worse still,&#13;

                     The management of sewage is not a small&#13;
                     matter. Each day, one person disposes of 15 ­ 50&#13;
                     grams of sewage. If there are one hundred million&#13;

                 In Indonesia, around 65% of houses in                Sewage management is typically seen as the&#13;
                 urban areas use septic tanks. In Jakarta             personal affair of the individual householder.&#13;
                 alone there are more than one million septic         It is the individual householder, it is argued,&#13;

                 largest number of septic tanks.                      Collectively, these millions of septic tanks&#13;

                 septic tank regulations in Indonesia. There          health risk to millions of other people.&#13;
                 are national standards for construction of&#13;
                 septic tanks, but beyond that there are no&#13;
                 regulations. None that restrict the number of&#13;
                 septic tanks per area unit. None that require&#13;
                 houseowners to have the contents of their&#13;
                 septic tanks pumped out regularly. Worse&#13;
                 still, no one feels the need to check on the&#13;

                         In a densely populated area like this one, there are countless numbers of septic&#13;
                         tanks.Whether located on a 50m2 or 5000m2 plot, each house has to have at least&#13;
                         one septic tank. Unwittingly, all this rule does is swell the number of septic tanks.&#13;
                         Groundwater quality is adversely affected by the large numbers of sub-standard&#13;
                         septic tanks.Some are more like pits because the base of the tank is not sealed.Some&#13;
                         have walls made of ordinary bricks. Some are too small. Some have inlet pipes that&#13;
                         are not functioning properly. Given these conditions, it would be natural to start&#13;
                         thinking about a sewerage system to replace these millions of septic tanks.&#13;

                 the Dutch colonial administration in the early                 in Indonesia is not all bad. The operation of sewerage&#13;

                 came to a halt after independence, and it wasn't               the coverage of their services. The sewerage system in&#13;

                    Today there are only ten cities that have sewerage&#13;
                 systems(Balikpapan,Banjarmasin,Bandung,Cirebon,&#13;
                 Jakarta, Medan, Prapat, Surakarta, Tangerang,&#13;

                     A modern sewerage system collects sewage&#13;
                     from homes and treats it until it meets effluent&#13;
                     standards. This system does away with the need&#13;
                     for septic tanks, and so reduces the risk of groundwater&#13;
                     pollution. A sewerage system consists of house connections,&#13;
                     sewagepipes,andatreatmentinstallation. Inmanyrichcountries,&#13;
                     treatment plants have full sludge treatment facilities. Good, modern,&#13;
                     full sewerage systems are few and far between in Indonesia. Perhaps the&#13;
                     only ones are in modern residential areas, such as Jababeka Cikarang, Lippo&#13;
                     Bekasi,and Lippo Karawaci.&#13;

                                                  the Bandung city water utility,which manages the system,will be installing aerators in these ponds.Eventually,&#13;

                 Our groundwater and our river water is polluted&#13;
                 by sewage from nearby communities. An Asian&#13;
                 Development Bank report warns that water pollution&#13;
                 in Indonesia could lead to 5 trillion rupiahs in losses&#13;

                 A loss of this magnitude is the same as a loss of&#13;
                 income of 100 thousand rupiahs a month for every&#13;
                 Indonesian household.&#13;
                    The figure is even larger if we include losses arising&#13;
                 from the indirect effects of water pollution. On the&#13;
                 tourism sector, on investment, and on land prices, for&#13;
                 example. Or from having our export products rejected&#13;
                 because of their dubious cleanliness.&#13;

                       A survey in Malang showed that sanitation is the number two priority for women. Among men,&#13;
                       sanitation ranked eighth. What's more, in many communities, it is the women who suggest that the&#13;
                       family has a latrine in the house. Why?&#13;
                         More so than men, women need a safe and comfortable place to go to the toilet, a place safe from&#13;
                       prying eyes. That's why women prefer to have a closed latrine, either in or close to the house. A&#13;
                       mother also wants to be sure that she and her children can go to the toilet in a safe place whenever&#13;
                       they need to, even at night. Women are also usually responsible for cleaning the family latrine.&#13;
                       Ultimately, they are the ones who know the kind of latrine that best suits the family's habits, the&#13;
                       water supply, and so on. So, women should be the key stakeholders in sanitation improvement&#13;

                      the people who live there are poor. And it's not hard      as easy as one might imagine. Without efforts to change&#13;

                      always successful. Latrines are constructed, but the&#13;
                      people don't want to use them. Latrines or no latrines,&#13;
                      free or not, they still prefer to defecate at the edge of&#13;

                 number and quality of existing facilities,       embarrassed than leading a city known&#13;
                 but also by changing people's behavior.          for its dirt and filth.&#13;
                 Better sanitation makes a region more&#13;

                 the district and city governments. Local&#13;

                                                         or septic tanks). Which means that 55% of the Indonesian population did not have access to basic&#13;

           The tasks of the various government institutions in&#13;
           sanitation development and management need to&#13;

                    Involving communities is not easy task. Often we need               groups, women's family welfare associations, youth groups,&#13;

                No one knows a residential area better than the people who live there.As&#13;
                long as they understand the goals and procedures,residents can conduct&#13;
                an assessment of the local sanitation condition better than anyone.&#13;
                This process of community participation assessment (CPA) will provide&#13;
                the basis for planning that is better understood by the local community.&#13;
                Making maps of the area that will later be used to decide where the&#13;
                sewerage pipes will be installed,is one example.&#13;

                USE&#13;
                WHAT IS APPROPRIATE&#13;
                  Sooner or later we have to decide on the                     At the end of the day, an appropriate system is&#13;
                  kind of sewerage we want to develop.                       determined by the effective use and sustainability&#13;
                     There are many options available, but all are           aspects. In other words, a sanitation system must&#13;
                  made up of the same components: latrines,                  be able to stand effective and continuous use. To&#13;
                  sewage pipes, sewage treatment plants, and                 dothis,asanitationsystemmustalsobeappropriate&#13;
                  sludge treatment facilities.                               to the demands and needs of its users. It would&#13;
                     First there are latrines. They can be privately         be a costly waste if we could not operate it.&#13;
                  owned or communal. The important thing is that&#13;
                  the privacy of users is protected and that the&#13;
                  latrines have gooseneck water seals. These are&#13;
                  the two conditions for a basic sanitation facility&#13;
                  to qualify as an improved sanitation facility.&#13;
                     So, sewage must be piped to a facility that can&#13;
                  control its impacts. The aim is to ensure that&#13;
                  sewage cannot be seen, smelled or touched,&#13;
                  and that it does not contaminate nearby water&#13;
                  sources. These facilities must be able to reduce&#13;
                  the polluting content of sewage. This is another&#13;
                  criteria for an improved sanitation facility. The                                                            Anoff-sitesystemischaracterized&#13;

            Urban sanitation : portraits, expectations,
            and opportunities - it's not a private matter anymore!
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Domestic wastewater management,
            including sewage treatment, requires support from
            government, the public and the private sector. Sewage
            treatment has been seen as an internal household issue. If
            each house has a latrine, sewage treatment must be adequate.
            Yet data tell a disturbing story of large numbers of people
            suffering from diarrhea, and polluted groundwater. Research
            shows that the root cause of these problems is sewage.
            Despite several government initiatives, significant progress
            has yet to be made, especially as regards wastewater
            management by households. What is more, not enough attention
            is paid to wastewater management at the household level to
            relieve the problem of urban sanitation. How and where
            people dispose of their sewage is no longer a personal
            problem, but one that affects us all. It is time for
            municipal and district governments to take more of a role in
            dealing with this issue. This booklet provides an overview
            of the state of sanitation management in Indonesia's
            cities, the constraints faced, the damage caused by poor
            sanitation, and opportunities for improvement.
