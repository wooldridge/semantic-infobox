Staff Working Paper No. 314&#13;

THE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS&#13;
The role of exports from developing countries has been at the&#13;
center of postwar discussions of the world economic order. This&#13;
paper explores the influences that have shaped export growth since&#13;
1960 and the prospects for their further expansion. Particular&#13;
emphasis is given to manufactured exports, which grew more than&#13;
twice as fast as total LDC export. from 1960-75.&#13;
If the momentum of manufactured export growth can be continued&#13;
as the World Bank has recently projected, LDC export growth in the&#13;
period 1975-85 could exceed 6% per year despite slow growth (probab-&#13;
ly no better than 3-4% per year) of primary exports. Manufactured&#13;
export composition and prospects in four groups of LDCs are analyzed.&#13;
A majority of these exports come from a small number of countries&#13;
that have specialized in manufactures starting in labor-intensive,&#13;
technologically stable ("older") products, using cost-cutting stra-&#13;
tegy based on low wages, while relying heavily on foreign buyers&#13;
for marketing and product design.  These countries are now trying&#13;
to diversify into more complex and skill-intensive products. Mean-&#13;
while,increasing numbers of LDCs not in this group have shifted&#13;
their policies at least part way in an export-oriented direction.&#13;
The rapid increase in manufactures exported from LDCs inter-&#13;
acting with developed countries' own poor economic performance&#13;
have combined to trigger rising protectionism, adding to uncertain-&#13;
ties about markets. An especially serious aspect of the problem is&#13;
the effect on export prospects of those LDCs that are not yet suc-&#13;
cessful exporters of manufactures, but will need to be so to faci-&#13;
litate their growth. Special measures to give the poorer and less&#13;
successful LDCs special export opportunities may have to be&#13;
considered.&#13;

ThE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS&#13;
Hollis B. Chenery and Donald B. Keesing&#13;
World Bank&#13;
Ts^_ role of exports from developing countries lias been&#13;
at the center of postwar discussions of the world economic order.&#13;
Until the mid-1960s the developing countries (LDCs) had a stead-&#13;
ily declining share of world exports, and manufactured goods&#13;
provided only about 10% of their export earnings. Slow export&#13;
growth was correctly perceived as a major obstacle to accelerated&#13;
development.&#13;
This picture has changed dramatically over the past&#13;
fifteen years without any drastic change in the policies of&#13;
industrialized countries toward the LDCs. The sustained growth&#13;
of the world economy up to 1974 and the shift toward more export-&#13;
oriented strategies by a large number of developing countries&#13;
have accelerated the growth of LDC exports, primarily from&#13;
those countries in a position to export manufactures. For&#13;
developing countries as a group, the export lag appears to have&#13;
been overcome, and nearly half of the increase in earnings now&#13;
1/&#13;
derives from manufactures.&#13;
1/ Although the rise in the price of oil contributed enormously&#13;
to the increased export revenues of a few developing&#13;
countries--notably Iran, Venezuela, NJigeria, Indonesia,&#13;
Algeria and Iraq--supply as well as demand limitations make&#13;
a continuation of these increases unlikely. (Throughout this&#13;
paper, the capital surplus oil countries--Kuwait, Libya, Oman,&#13;
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates--are treated&#13;
as a separate group so as not to distort the analysis of&#13;
other developing countries.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
When we take a less aggregated view of recent perfor-&#13;
tiance, major features of the earlier picture reemerge. Export&#13;
expansion has been a major contributor to the growth of a number&#13;
of countries, whose incomes have risen substantially over the&#13;
past twenty years. However, both export expansion and GNP&#13;
growth have been concentrated in countries containing only a&#13;
third of the population of the developing coitntries.  The poorer&#13;
LDCs, concentrated in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, supply&#13;
only 10% of LDC exports aAd still have most of the features that&#13;
characterized the third world in the 1950s.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to assess the main factors&#13;
causing this transformation of LDC exports and to consider the&#13;
contribution that they may make to the future growth of different&#13;
1/&#13;
groups of countries.   Since the bulk of export growth is expected&#13;
to take place in manufactured goods, we focus mainly on this cate-&#13;
gory. The first section of the paper examines the changing com-&#13;
position of exports since 1960 and its association with the&#13;
emergence of a small number of successful LDC exporters of manu-&#13;
factures. The second section relates this performance to the&#13;
development strategies and changing comparative advantage of&#13;
different groups of countries. The final section takes up growth&#13;
2/&#13;
prospects and some of the policy issues raised.&#13;
1/  For simplicity, only merchandise exports will be considered;&#13;
henceforth, exports means merchandise exports except where&#13;
specifically noted.&#13;
2/ This study is an outgrowth of continuing work in the World&#13;
Bank on the prospects for developing countries in relation&#13;
to the future evolution of the world economy. It makes use&#13;
of two recent reports, Prospects for Developing Countries,&#13;
1978-1985 (World Bank, Development Policy Staff, 1977) and&#13;
World Development Report, 1978 (WDR).&#13;

I. EXPORT TRENDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
Since at least the 1950s, LDC exports have grown in&#13;
volume more slowly than those of industrialized countries (MDCs)&#13;
and those of the world as a whole, largely because they have been&#13;
concentrated in primary products, where the growth of demand&#13;
and world trade has been relatively slow. This situation is&#13;
now changing rapidly as increasing numbers of LDCs shift toward&#13;
manufactures. The share of manufactures in exports has risen&#13;
rapidly, and they will soon comptise over half of LDC merchandise&#13;
1/&#13;
exports other than oil. If this. expansion continues as expected,&#13;
it will lad over the next few years to an export growth rate&#13;
roughly equal to that of the rest. of the world. These trends&#13;
2/&#13;
for major commodity groups are stmmarized in Table 1.&#13;
A. Export Trends by Region&#13;
Growth of exports and cutput has been generally&#13;
fastest in regions, such as East Asia, that have been most&#13;
successful in exporting manufactures, while low growth perfor-&#13;
mance has been especially characteristic in low-income countries&#13;
(those with GNP at or below $250 in 1976). If Indonesia is&#13;
excluded, the low-income countries have experienced very little&#13;
growth in their exports since 1965. GNP increased in the low-&#13;
income countries at only 3.1% per year from 1960-75 compared to&#13;
1/ Even if Southern Europe is excluded, this share is now close&#13;
to 40%.&#13;
2/  This is the "base" or middle case in which GNP in MDCs is&#13;
projected to grow at 4.2% per year. (Cf. Table 10 below.)&#13;

6% in the other ("middle-income") LDCs. Exports per head are&#13;
12 times higher in this second group. Broad differences in the&#13;
composition of exports between these and other groups of countries&#13;
1/&#13;
are summarized in Table 2.&#13;
In coming years. much as in the recent past, export&#13;
growth is expected to be fastest in regions with a high propor-&#13;
tion of manufactures in their exports. This is illustrated by&#13;
Table 3, which shows projected growth rates of LDC exports by&#13;
region in 1980-85 (a choice of years which allows us to exclude&#13;
complications associated with the post-1975 recovery) compared&#13;
to 1965-76. Export growth is expected to be fastest in the&#13;
middle-income countries of East Asia and the Pacific followed by&#13;
Southern Europe;  these are the regions most successful (and&#13;
most specialized) in manufactures. Sub-Saharan Africa is&#13;
expected to have the slowest export growth followed by Ncrth&#13;
Africa and the Middle East; these are the regions most depen-&#13;
dent on primary commodities.&#13;
B. Trends in Primary Exports&#13;
1. Fuel. In contrast co the slow growth in mcst other&#13;
primary exports, there has been a bonanza in LDC oil exports,&#13;
thanks to the four-fold rise in price in 1973-74, following a&#13;
sustained growth of volume at rates of 6-7% per year. As a&#13;
result, even with capital-surplus oil exporters excluded, fuel&#13;
has come to outweigh all other primary exports combined.&#13;
1/ Apparent similarities between low- and middle-income LDCs in&#13;
the composition of exports disappear in a disaggregation by&#13;
regions.&#13;

unit value indexes taken from UN Yearbook of International Trade&#13;
Statistics 1976, Vol. I, p. 81, and UN Monthly Bulletin of&#13;
Statistics, July 1978, p. xx. These show unit value of LDC&#13;
exports for all LDCs (1970-100) increasing from 93 in 1965 to&#13;
331 in 1976, and for importers of petroleum, from 89 in 1965&#13;
to 196 in 1976. Oil exporters' nominal export growth was deflated&#13;
by the first and that of other LDCs by the second index.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Benefits from this windfall have been concentrated in&#13;
a sr,all set of oil-exporting countries. It includes two large,&#13;
poor cDuntries--Indonesia and Nigeria--whose growth has been&#13;
substantially accelerated in the past five years. The other&#13;
OPEC members have benefitted even more, but their total popula-&#13;
tion is less than 100 million people.&#13;
Prior to the oil price rise, world demand for fuel&#13;
exports rose faster than world income, but since then it has been&#13;
expanding more slowly. The greatly increased incentives to expand&#13;
domestic fuel supplies and to economize on energy use are helping&#13;
to turn up new sources in LDCs while slowing the growth of world&#13;
trade and consumption. On balance, the prospect seems to be for&#13;
growth in export volumes at rates of 3-4% per year with a possi-&#13;
bility of future price increases in real terms.&#13;
2. Agricultural Products. Table 1 shows that agricul-&#13;
ture, livestock, forestry, fishing and food processing together&#13;
..                l~~~~~/&#13;
supplied 43% of LDC exports in 1960, but this share fell to&#13;
27% in 1975 and is trending downward. World demand for exports&#13;
of agricultural products nearly keeps pace with world income,&#13;
growing at rates over 4% per year. Expansion of export demand&#13;
reflects not only rising incomes but also growing food deficits&#13;
in ittan) centrally planned economies (CPEs) and LDCs. While the&#13;
LDC_. as a group were virtually self-sufficient in food in the&#13;
1950s, by 1975 their net imports exceeded 30 million tons.&#13;
Present ^stimates poinit to a food deficit of some 45 million tons&#13;
by  98r.&#13;
1/ or 52% in current prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
The LDC share of world exports of agricultural products&#13;
has fallen over time; their growth rate of 2.6% from 1960-75&#13;
was less than half that achieved in MDCs. This weak performance&#13;
has been due, first, to an initial concentration in tropical&#13;
products such as coffee, cocoa, tea and bananas, in which world&#13;
demand has expanded only slowly. Second, trade and tax regimes&#13;
in many LDCs have discouraged agricultural production and exports&#13;
in favor of other activities, notably manufacturing for the home&#13;
market. Third, world efforts to raise farm output through agri-&#13;
cultural research and extension, investments and improved&#13;
inputs are largely concentrated in temperate zones and richer&#13;
countries, where LDC exports are also held back by MDC protection.&#13;
However, despite these handicaps, agricultural output in LDCs&#13;
has actually grown faster than in MDCs, but has been offset by&#13;
rising home demand due to population and income growth.&#13;
Increasing the growth rate of agricultural exports&#13;
from LDCs hinges on accelerating supply in the face of fast-growinc&#13;
domestic demand. In a number of agricultural products (grain,&#13;
meat, timber, rubber, etc.), the potential export market is&#13;
favorable, even though food products face widespread protection,&#13;
particularly from nontariff barriers in OECD countries designed&#13;
to give better prices to farmers. Policies toward agriculture&#13;
have been improving in some of the major developing countries.&#13;
As a result, both production and export growth are expected to&#13;
rise, the latter to over 3% a year through 1985. Efforts to&#13;
stabilize prices and earnings in agricultural commodities, to the&#13;
extent they are successful, could contribute to export expansion&#13;
by reducing uncertainties that discourage investment. Projected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
grxi.fwth -ates of LDC exports in leading agricultural products,&#13;
together with those in leading minerals are shown in Table 4.&#13;
3. Non-fuel Minerals. In this category (which&#13;
includes nonferrous metals), LDCs have achieved export growth&#13;
rates close to 5%. While world demand expands more slowly than&#13;
world income, the LDC share of total supply is growing, thanks to&#13;
untapped supplies and less exploitation than in more industrial-&#13;
ized countries. These resource advantages are partly offset by&#13;
the reactions of MDC investors to increased taxation and the&#13;
political uncertainties in LDCs. Here, as in oil, the diffusion&#13;
of technology has improved the bargaining position of host coun-&#13;
tries, which increasingly have the options of national ownership&#13;
or joint ventures as alternatives to foreign-owned mining opera-&#13;
tions. (Domestic demand beyond the processing stage is usually&#13;
a negligible influence on export availability.)&#13;
Growth of LDC mineral exports is projected to accelerate&#13;
somewhat and to continue to outpace world demand, with export&#13;
growth rates approaching 6% per year. To a somewhat lesser extent&#13;
than in fuel, these exports come mainly from a small set of LDCs.&#13;
The mineral exporters rarely have high GNP per capita compared&#13;
to the general range for middle-income countries, and in sub-&#13;
Sahal-an Africa most of these would be classed as low-income or even&#13;

sificatio. seems to be largely a result of deliberate efforts by&#13;
LLCs to escape from dependence on a single commodity by building&#13;
up expozt±; of other products.&#13;
C. Trends in Manufactured Exports&#13;
The most basic change in the pattern of LDC exports&#13;
has been 1-he spectacular growth in manufactures. From 1960 to&#13;
1975 these exports expanded at rdtes of over 12% per year. This&#13;
growth accelerated in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has con-&#13;
tinued strongly despite the setbacks suffered by the world economy&#13;
since 1973. During the world recession of 1975 the volume of LDC&#13;
manufactured exports seems to have risen in volume by at least&#13;
6-7% even though output and consumption of manufactures fell&#13;
2/&#13;
sharply in MDCs.    In the 1976 recovery, LDC manufactured&#13;
exports leaped forward by over 20%; and in the slow growth con-&#13;
ditions of 1977, they appear to have expanded once again in real&#13;
terms by over 10%, despite a decline in clothing and textiles,&#13;
3/&#13;
although world trade increased only 4%.&#13;
1/ In unpublished research for World Development Report.&#13;
2/ This export growth was largely masked by a shift in the terms&#13;
of trade against these exports.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1. Country Concentration. The bulk of manufactured&#13;
exports come from a small number of industrially relatively&#13;
advanced LDCs, as shown in Table 7 below. The Republic of Korea,&#13;
Taiwan (Republic of China), Spain and Hong Kong together supply&#13;
close to 45% of the total. Next come Yugoslavia, Brazil and&#13;
Mexico. However, the growth in these exports has been widely&#13;
shared, cis illustrated by Table 5. More than forty LDCsE now&#13;
have exports worth over $100 million, compared to 22 in 1970 and&#13;
fewer earlier.  Although the scale and pace of this growth have&#13;
varied from one country to another, in many the upsurge has been&#13;
persistent and powerful.&#13;
At a product level, the3 breadth of this advance is&#13;
impressive. From almost any year in the 1960s through 1976, real&#13;
growth rates have been over 10%, not only in clothing and elec-&#13;
tronic assembly (which have made striking gains), but also in&#13;
machinery, transport equipment, :extile yarn and fabrics, steel,&#13;
chemicals, and almost every other major group. Growth of 10%&#13;
per year or more seems to be the rule rather than the exception&#13;
1/&#13;
even at the level of individual products.    However, most of these&#13;
strong performances started from a low base in the 1960s, parti-&#13;
cularly in products that are technically complex, skill-intensive&#13;
and/or subject to strong economies of scale.&#13;
Looked at slightly differently, the steady advance of&#13;
manufactured exports has been accompanied by an equally persistent&#13;
diversification, with successful export breakthroughs being wide-&#13;
spread. In practically every case the more complex and&#13;

difficult-to-produce of these products come initially from one&#13;
or two of the most industrialized LDCs. Among less industrialized&#13;
LDCs, one finds the same sort of process going on at a smaller&#13;
scale and in simpler products.&#13;
2.  Exports by Destination.  Strong growth        taken&#13;
place in manufactured exports in all major markets.  Especially&#13;
rapid expansion has occurred in LDC exports to MDCs, which have&#13;
outpaced the rest. Those going to other LDCs and to CPEs have&#13;
also increasedin 1960-75 at annual rates above 10%.&#13;
Table 6 illustrates the compositional differences&#13;
between manufactures exported to MDCs and to other LDCs in 1975.&#13;
In the aggregate, nearly two-thirds of LDC manufactured exports&#13;
go to MDCs, nearly one-third to other LDCs, and limited amounts&#13;
to CPEs. There is considerable vrariation by product: products&#13;
such as clothing and electronic products go mainly to MDCs, while&#13;
products such as textiles and chetmicals are traded more among&#13;
LDCs. This is also true of some types of machinexy and transport&#13;
equipment. However, trade in capital goods among LDCs i.; quite&#13;
limited: nine leading exporters reported only $587 million in&#13;

3. Overview. In summary, the rapid growth of manufac-&#13;
tured exports appears to have been mainly the result of a supply&#13;
breakthrough. Demand growth has played only a secondary role,&#13;
especially since LDC shares of most markets were initially quite&#13;
small. Substantial growth has taken place even in products in&#13;
which aggregate demand grew only slowly: in clothing, consump-&#13;
tion appears to have grown in MDCs at about 3% per year while&#13;
LDC exports to MDCs grew at over 20% a year.&#13;
LDC success in exporting manufactures seems to have&#13;
four main explanations, all but one of them on the supply side:&#13;
-     (1)  Rapid overall development has increased the&#13;
industrial capabilities of the leading exporters of manufactures&#13;
and contributed to their ability to move into related export&#13;
products.&#13;
(2) There has been a widespread shift in LDC policies&#13;
away from inward-looking industrialization around the home market,&#13;
toward a systematic effort to export industrial products.&#13;
(3) Improvements in transport and communications&#13;
have facilitated growth of trade and an international division&#13;
of labor even over long distances.&#13;
(4) International trade policies of the industrial&#13;
countries have maintained access to their markets and, at least&#13;
until recently, continued the postwar trend toward trade liberal-&#13;
ization in industrial products. LDC exports have benefitted&#13;
from Dillon and Kennedy round tariff cuts, offshore assembly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

provisic.s in tariffs, preferences from the European Community,&#13;
Gentiralized Syster of Preferences (GSP) schemes in various MDCs,&#13;
-nd resistance to pressures for more restrictive nontariff&#13;
1/&#13;
barriers.&#13;
For the last two reasons, trade in manufactures has&#13;
grown faster than output in both MDCs and LDCs. The faster&#13;
export growth in developing countries is attributable to the&#13;
first two influences--rapid industrial development and a shift&#13;
2/&#13;
toward outward-looking policies.&#13;
It is not widely appreciated how many developing coun-&#13;
tries have been changing their policies to promote manufactured&#13;
exports. This shift began around 1960 and went further later in&#13;
Spain, Taiwan (Republic of China), Republic of Korea, Yugoslavia,&#13;
3/&#13;
GreectC, israel and Portugal.   In the course of the 1960s, Brazil,&#13;
Mexico and Singapore and to a lesser extent others (e.g., Pakistan)&#13;
shifted policies in the same direction. More recently export&#13;
prGrotiuLuA measures have become a significant component of indus-&#13;
trialiZaLion policies in many other countries, notably Colombia,&#13;
Argen.ira, Uruguay, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Morocco, Haiti,&#13;

1/  hev%eve,r, trade liberalization has favored MDC industrial&#13;
e%ports over LDC specialties, which tend to be exempted from&#13;
t4riff cuts and GSP schemes.&#13;
2/  The initial composition of these exports would almost certainly&#13;
have led to a slower growth rate in LDCs than MDCs, if both&#13;
grouks of countries had maintained their market shares.&#13;

II.  CHANGING COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND LDC GROWTH&#13;
A number of studies have shown a strong relation&#13;
between export expansion and the growth of GNP.   It is fairly&#13;
well established that countries cannot continue to grow rapidly&#13;
by steadily reducing the share of imports in GNP and that expan-&#13;
ding the share of imports and exports in GNP permits more effi-&#13;
cient allocationof resources and more rapid growth. At least&#13;
over an extended period, export growth seems to be a necessary&#13;
2/&#13;
though not a sufficient condition for rapid GNP growth.&#13;
The previous discussior. shows that in order to accelerate&#13;
the growtn of exports the develoFing countries have in recent years&#13;
changed tLeir export composition substantially, shifting away&#13;
from the ,lower-growing primary products toward manufactures,&#13;
and within manufactures, diversifying into new commodities as&#13;
skills and experience are acquired. We will now examine this&#13;
process in somewhat more detail for groups of countries that&#13;
differ in their initial income levels, resources and trade policies.&#13;
Recent empirical studies have had considerable success&#13;
in explaining the composition of manufactured exports from LDCs&#13;
in terms of both the Heckscher-Ohlin approach (including skills&#13;
I/  S-e, for example, Maizels (1968), Chenery (1971), Balassa (1977a)&#13;
and Michaely 1977). The last allows for the fact that exports&#13;
are a component of GNP by relating GNP growth to the increase&#13;
in the share of exports in GNP, with highly significant results.&#13;
2,/ F'- limited periods, capital inflows can replace exports as&#13;
a source of foreign exchange, but in cases of successful devel-&#13;
opment this has only deferred the need to expand exports by&#13;
a decade or so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
as a factor of production) and more recent technological explana-&#13;
tions based on the product cycle, technical progress and scale&#13;
economies.    There have been fewer explorations of other influences&#13;
such as learning processes in marketing and product design, that&#13;
contribute to success in exporting manufactured go6ds. These&#13;
influences appear to be part of a cumulative process that has&#13;
produced a relatively small number of very successful LDC exporters.&#13;
A. Comparative Advantage by Country Groups&#13;
To illuminate the relationships among initial econovic&#13;
structure, trade policies and export performance, we shall use&#13;
a modified version of the classification of trade and production&#13;
patterns proposed by Chenery and Syrquin (1975). *Table 7&#13;
classifies selected developing countries (including all those&#13;
having more than $150 million worth of manufactured exports in&#13;
1977) into four groups. The first three contain countries with&#13;
a per capita income (in $1976) of more than $300, which are well&#13;
along in the process of development; the fourth consists of&#13;
poorer countries.&#13;
I.  Countries that specialized relatively earlyin&#13;
exports of manufactures and have followed generally outward-&#13;
looking policies.&#13;
1/ See, for example, Hufbauer (1970), Hirsch (1974), Stern (1975),&#13;
Helleiner (1976), and Balassa (1977b). A number of regional.&#13;
applications are given in Giersch, ed. (1974).&#13;

entirely of aluminum oxide, and New Caledonia, which exports&#13;
ferrous nickel.&#13;

II. Large semi-industrial countries, with relatively&#13;
low export shares in GNP, that have achieved considerable success&#13;
in industrialization based mainly on the home market, but in&#13;

III.  Countries now shifting part way from  -ecial-&#13;

IV. Large poor countries with significant exports of&#13;
manufactures.&#13;
These groupings are meant to illustrate the main policies&#13;
1/&#13;
and countries involved, without being exhaustive. Brief&#13;
comments follow on each group.&#13;
Group I: Early Specialization in Manufactures&#13;
This group contains four East Asian countries (hong&#13;
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea) and three Mediterranean&#13;
countries (Israel, Portugal and Greece). Although waqe levels&#13;
were somewhat higher in the Mediterranean group in 1960, they&#13;
are all characterized by limited natural resources, relatively&#13;
educated labor, and the need to export manufactures (or services)&#13;
,in_order to develop. The composition of their exports generally&#13;
corresponds to expectations based on trade theories of both&#13;
factor-proportions and product-cycle types. With local varia-&#13;
tions, their exports have been built initially around&#13;
1/ A classification of all transitional countries is given in&#13;
Chenery (1977), which also traces the past growth of each&#13;
of the main groups. In addition to the countries shown in&#13;
Table 7, there are many smaller exporters of manufactures.&#13;
/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
labor-intensive, technologically stable ("older") products&#13;
such as textiles, clothing, footwear, assembled electronic com-&#13;
ponents, toys, etc. 1/&#13;
In these footloose industries, the role of policy is&#13;
substantial in determining the location of particular products.&#13;
For example, over 90% of LDC clothing exports and almost all the&#13;
electronic products come from locations where imported inputs&#13;
are given virtual free-trade treatment by one means or another.&#13;
The electronics exports come from places with favorable treat-&#13;
ment of "multinational" corporations (MNCs) as well. 2!&#13;
More than trade theory has emphasized to date, LDCs'&#13;
limited capabilities in marketing and related aspects of design&#13;
appear to restrict their capacity to export even labor-intensive&#13;
consumer and capital goods. -/ LDCs depend heavily on outsiders&#13;
to market exports of these products even where production is in&#13;
local hands (as is typical, for instance, in footwear and&#13;
1/ Natural resource processing has also played a role in several&#13;
cases.&#13;
2/ Although a few products such as radios are largely produced&#13;
by locally-owned firms.&#13;
3/ Marketing and related aspects of design are defined here to&#13;
include almost all nonproduction activities required to adjust&#13;
a product to the tastes of the customer, to profit from&#13;
product differentiation, to find buyers and "sell" them on&#13;
the product, and to test, package, ship, distribute and&#13;
service the product so as to meet the special needs of the&#13;
customer. We would exclude from "design", and treat as a&#13;
separate activity, as well as technology transfer, adaptation,&#13;
and research having to do with production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
clothing). Tailoring production to what the customer needs,&#13;
and marketing suitably differentiated products, involves exper-&#13;
ience, skills, information and organization that are difficult&#13;
for newcomers to achieve. As a rule LDC firms compete mainly&#13;
in markets for consumer goods where a cost-cutting strategy can&#13;
be effective, for example, in selling to wholesalers for distri-&#13;
bution to people (in LDCs or MDCs) too poor to be concerned with&#13;
brand names. They may also furnish production capacity to MDC&#13;
firms that know how to compete in markets characterized by brands.&#13;
and administered prices. Even marketing consumer goods exports&#13;
with help from MDC buyers involves a learning process that is not&#13;
easy. It is striking that a large majority of LDC exports of&#13;
clothing come from just three countries in this group--Hong Kong,&#13;
Republic of Korea and Taiwan--perhaps because they have accumulated&#13;
the necessary information links and experience in getting the&#13;
product together and delivering reliably on time, even though&#13;
several of the other LDCs that are trying to export clothing have&#13;
lower wages and all have fewer problems with quotas.&#13;
Group II: Large Semi-Industrial Countries&#13;
The countries in Group II have developed a substantial&#13;
industrial structure based on import substitution and protection&#13;
and have gradually dismantled at least some of these policies&#13;
over the past ten to twenty years. Spain and Yugoslavia were the&#13;
earliest to undertake this shift and have reached per capita&#13;
levels of manufactured exports that are comparable to Group I.&#13;
However, the share of exports in GNP for these large countries&#13;
is considerably below that of most of the smaller, more specialized&#13;
economies in Group I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Most of these countries began to expand manufactured&#13;
exports when afflicted with shortages of foreign exchange: in&#13;
some cases the benefits of increasing imports may have outweighed&#13;
considerations of efficiency in the choice of export sectors.&#13;
Over time these countries have managed to develop export markets&#13;
for the capital goods, chemicals and other intermediate goods&#13;
for which their domestic markets, augmented by exports, provide&#13;
sufficient economies of scale. As a result, Spain, Yugoslavia&#13;
and Brazil have become the leading LDC exporters of capital&#13;
1/&#13;
goods.    This is a logical direction for the evolution of com-&#13;
parative advantage in large middle-income countries, but success&#13;
depends to an even greater degree than in consumer goods on&#13;
design, marketing and technical services.&#13;
Although the present diversified export pattern of&#13;
the Group II Countries (which is discussed further in the next&#13;
section) is largely the result of protection and import substi-&#13;
tution, it is still a matter of dispute as to whether the earlier,&#13;
inefficient policy was a precondition for the present degree of&#13;
success in building up exports based on scale economies. This&#13;
issue--which is discussed for the Latin American countries by&#13;
Diaz-Alejandro (1974)--is of mainly historical interest for the&#13;
present members of this group, and for India, which now has a&#13;
lony history of inefficient import substitution. However, it is&#13;
centrai to the future policies of prospective members of the Group,&#13;
such as Egypt, Pakistan and Indonesia.&#13;
1/  Fo'Llowed by Taiwan, Republic of  e-La, Argentinat and India.&#13;
The role of market size is evident.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
The continued success of the Group II countries&#13;
depends on a set of cumulative processes somewhat different&#13;
from those in the smaller, more specialized economies of Group&#13;
I. The potential advantages of large countries lie in their&#13;
ability to develop economies of scale based on their home&#13;
markets, leading over time to production and exports of machinery&#13;
and transport equipment along with standardized intermediate&#13;
goods such as chemicals and basic metals. This sequence has&#13;
been followed most successfully by Spain, Yugoslavia and Brazil.&#13;
Another reason for this pattern of specialization is&#13;
that several of the Group II countries have considerable export&#13;
earnings from natural resources, contributing to relatively high&#13;
wage levels.    This may mean that like other resource-rich&#13;
countries before them (the United States, Canada, Sweden, and&#13;
Australia) they will be forced to build their industrial exports&#13;
around relatively skill-, capital- and natural-resource-intensive&#13;
products, where their wage levels will not be a serious handicap.&#13;
Group III: Countries Emerging from Primary Specialization&#13;
The countries shown in Group III all exported relatively&#13;
insignificant amounts of manufactures in 1960 but have achieved&#13;
significant increases in the past fifteen years. This has helped&#13;
to diversify their exports and as a rule has improved their&#13;
prospects for more rapid export growth. The optimal timing of&#13;
such a shift into manufactured exports depends in part on the&#13;
prospects of (and effects on) primary exports. To accomplish&#13;
1/  This is particularly true in Argentina, Spain and Brazil, and&#13;
is becominq true of Mexico, as a result of new oil discoveries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
this shift through the market mechanism has proved difficult&#13;
for countries rich in natural resources whose current exchange&#13;
rates are based on this pattern of specialization. Conversely,&#13;
countries in this group that still have rather low wage levels&#13;
by comparative standards, such as Colombia, the Philippines and&#13;
Thailand, find this shift easier.&#13;
Within Group III, Malaysia, Colombia and Thailand&#13;
have managed to stimulate the growth of manufactured exports&#13;
without excessive interference with markets, through subsidies&#13;
or otherwise. The Philippines and Chile have shifted policies&#13;
sharply in recent years in pursuit of this goal.&#13;
In Iran and Venezuela industrial exports are almost&#13;
inevitably energy- or capital-intensive, while the poorest&#13;
Group III countries are pushed more in a labor-intensive direc-&#13;
tion. In between, there is not a compelling need to stress&#13;
labor-intensive exports.&#13;
Group IV: Large Poor Countries&#13;
This group includes the principal countries with&#13;
income levels below $300 per capita that have achieved a signi-&#13;
ficant volume of manufactured exports or have the industrial base&#13;
1/&#13;
to do so in the near future.    They also include 75% of the&#13;
population of all countries with per capita incomes of $280 or less&#13;
in 1976, and the possibility of their benefitting more fully from&#13;
1/ Haiti, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Vietnam have some potential but&#13;
their actual exports of manufactures are still very small.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
international trade is therefore of great concern to world&#13;
development. This is a heterogeneous group. At one extreme,&#13;
India has a long history of industrial development and a diver-&#13;
sified production capability; at the other, Bangladesh has litLle&#13;
industrial capability beyond processing of jute, and its manu-&#13;
factured exports are almost wholly jute textiles. Limited&#13;
supplies of foreign exchange have hampered the growth of India,&#13;
Pakistan and Egypt over most of the past fifteen years, while&#13;
Bangladesh is heavily dependent on external aid.&#13;
The industrial base for exportinc- a variety of manu-&#13;
factured goods has already been   'ablished in India,   ypt and&#13;
Pakistan, but these countries have only followed policies favor-&#13;
ing manufactured exports for brief    iods (Pakistan in the late&#13;
1960s, India in the last several years). In addition to th&#13;
comparative advantage deriving from low wages, all three (and&#13;
particularly India) are in a position to benefit from the economies&#13;
of scale inherent in a large domestic market. As shown ir the next&#13;
section, the composition of Indian exports shows some changes in&#13;
this direction in recent years.&#13;
B. Changing Composition of Manufactured Exports&#13;
Compared to manufactured exports from industrial&#13;
countries, those from LDCs contain a much smaller share of capital&#13;
goods and consumer engineering products, and a larger share of&#13;
clothing, footwear and textile.   This is a familiar reflection&#13;
of differences in skilled vs unskilled labor requirements and the&#13;
technical complexity of tile goods involved. However, only a&#13;
small number of LDCs ir. Groups I and II have been particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30 -&#13;
successful in exporting finished consumer goods, including&#13;
clothing and footwear, let alone capital goods.&#13;
Table 8 shows the product composition of manufactures&#13;
in seven main categories, chosen on the basis of marketing&#13;
characteristics as well as technological and factor requirements.&#13;
I                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~1/&#13;
Only in the principal countries in Group II --Spain, Yugoslavia,&#13;
Brazil and Argentina--do capital goods comprise more than 12% of&#13;
manufactured exports, compared to the 32% average in MDCs. Capital&#13;
2/&#13;
and consumer goods together comprise over 40% of exports only&#13;
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Spain, Yugoslavia and Brazil, which&#13;
are also the six largest LDC exporters of manufactures. In&#13;
almost all leading MDCs, this share is over 40%.&#13;
In countries with limited exporting experience--&#13;
particularly those of Groups III and IV--exports of manufactures&#13;
consist largely of textile yarn and fabrics and other standardized&#13;
intermediate goods, such as leather, plywood, cement, steel and&#13;

cc:-c;'1ities.  Many resource-rich LDCs export relatively capital-&#13;
.nltnsive standardized goods.  One also finds exports of less&#13;
standardized intermediate goods--for example, electronic compo-&#13;
nents--and trade in household articles and equipment, building&#13;
materials, etc., in which transport costs and proximity play an&#13;
1/&#13;
evident role.&#13;
Table 9 shows changes in the composition of exports&#13;
in leading countries from 1965 to 1975, illustrating the rising&#13;
share of capital goods and consumer goods in almost all cases.&#13;
This trend helps to confirm that export success has been based&#13;
in part on learning special skills involved in marketing and&#13;
2/&#13;
producing for customer specifications.&#13;
Two other points deserve some comment. First, a few&#13;
leading Group I and II countries are now exporting technically&#13;
complex products, such as supertankers, aircraft and heavy&#13;
machinery. Second, in regard to the product cycle, there seems&#13;
to have been, if not a shortening of this cycle, a moving up in&#13;
1/ LDCs close to MDC markets, such as Mexico or Yugoslavia,&#13;
emphasize labor-intensive products in which transport costs&#13;
and delivery time afford them an advantage. Transport costs&#13;
are also important in trade among LDCs.&#13;
2/ The requisite management, marketing and design capabilities&#13;
appear to be areas where LDCs are weak compared to MDCs and&#13;
MNCs, and may be profitable areas for LDC development efforts.&#13;

III. FUTURE PROSPECTS&#13;
Although the recent trends in LDC exports have been&#13;
quite encouraging, the question remains whether world markets&#13;
for manufactures will support the export needs of the LDCs in&#13;
the future. This question leads to such matters as economic&#13;
management and protectionism in MDCs, LDC policies and supply&#13;
potentials, and the country distribution of increases in exports.&#13;
We will comment selectively on these issues in the general context&#13;
of the World DeveloEment Report.&#13;
A. Effects of World Growth&#13;
To illustrate the sensitivity of LDC exports to growth&#13;
in the advanced countries, the World Development Report makes&#13;
alternative assumptions about the rate of the advanced (MDC)&#13;
countries' growth varying from 3.7% to 4.7% a year for the period&#13;
1975-1985, with the midpoint (4.2%) as the base case. The&#13;
corresponding variations in world trade and in LDC exports are&#13;
shown in Table 10. In the aggregate, the latter vary from 5.4%&#13;
to 7.4%, proportionately more than the variation in world growth.&#13;
The breakdown indicated for major categories of exports&#13;
depends largely on the supply response of producers, which is&#13;
taken up below. Overall it is assumed that manufactured exports&#13;
are highly responsive to demand conditions while primary exports&#13;
are assumed to be limited more by supply conditions over this&#13;
period.&#13;

B. Supply vs Demand Constraints&#13;
As a result of LDC successes, market penetration and&#13;
employment effects have reached a sufficient level in many&#13;
products so that protectionist responses have been triggered in&#13;
MDCs. MDC demand growth has therefore become a major concern,&#13;
and demand limitations along with supply will shape LDC perform-&#13;
ance in the future. The seriousness of protective pressures and&#13;
of MDC demand constraints will depend to some extent on how many&#13;
LDCs are highly successful at the same time. Nevertheless, growth&#13;
of LDC exports of manufactures will continue to depend heavily&#13;
on supply performance almost regardless of the treatment of these&#13;
exports or the economic situation in MDCs.&#13;
1. Supply Potential. In the long run, policies will&#13;
be decisive in shaping LDC export performance: not just trade&#13;
and exchange rate policies but how well development is managed&#13;
on all fronts, how fast industrialization moves forward, and&#13;
whether countries become internationally competitive. Since it&#13;
takes time for better policies to produce these effects, there&#13;
are only a few candidates to add to the successful manufacturing&#13;
exporters in Groups I and II within the next decade.&#13;
In terms of our previous classification, only one or&#13;
two Group III countries (notably the Philippines at this moment)&#13;
and perhaps India in Group IV now pursue policies that might&#13;
increase their manufactured goods exports to the higher levels&#13;
of Groups I and II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
There is al¶ uncertainty in regard to what products&#13;
LDCs can develop next. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan are&#13;
making an intensive effort to build up exports of capital goods&#13;
and other complex prod.cts, spurred by restrictions imposed on&#13;
their simpler exports.  As our earlier comments suggest, this&#13;
will be a difficult shift. Another qiestion is, how fast can&#13;
Brazil, India, Mexico, Argentina, etc., expand their manufactured&#13;
exports, if they tilt policies further in this direction, given&#13;
the domestic orientation of their production capacity, infra-&#13;
structure, and experience? A third question is, how fast can&#13;
exporting and marketing know-how be built up in LDCs that are&#13;
now pnly minor exporters?&#13;
More generally, LDC exports are no longer expanding&#13;
from such a low base, s6 high growth rates may be difficult to&#13;
maintain in the countries that have already reached relatively&#13;
high levels.&#13;
2. erket Penetration. LpCs now have a substantial&#13;
share in MDC markets for manufactured imports, as Table 11&#13;
illustrates. In telation to MDCs' total consumption of manu-&#13;
factures, the LDC market sh4re remains small except in a few&#13;
narrow product categories. Nevertheless, at the margin LDCs&#13;
are making a signifiqant impact on MDC demand for manufactures.&#13;
Table 12 shows that from 1970-75--partly as a result of the&#13;
recession at the end of the period--increased imports from LDCs&#13;
supplied about 7% of the increase in MDC consumption of manu-&#13;
factures. This marginal share is projected to remain over 5%&#13;
&#13;

through 1985. The total share in consumption is projected to&#13;
rise from 1.2% in 1975 to 2.7% in 1985.&#13;
In particular products, market penetration is&#13;
considerably higher. For example, in textiles and clothing&#13;
together, by 1975 the share of consumption reached 5%, varying&#13;
in the largest MDCs from 8% in the Federal Republic of Germany&#13;
to 2% in France. In the European Community as a whole, imports&#13;
from LDCs supplied 55% of the market for men's woven shirts&#13;
and 45% for women's blouses, as well as 22-26% in five other&#13;
major products.   In the U.S. in the same year, imports from&#13;
all sources (mainly from LDCs) supplied 56% of the market in&#13;
women's sweaters and over one-fourth in a number of other types&#13;
2/&#13;
of clothing.    Imports from LDCs also supplied roughly half the&#13;
radios and monochrome television sets purchased by U.S. consumers.&#13;
3. Effects of Protection. This successful market&#13;
penetration has contributed to the steady decline of some of the&#13;
industries most affected, particularly those in which demand is&#13;
growing slowly (clothing and footwear).  Repercussions on prices,&#13;
profits, and employment have hurt all the more because of depressed&#13;
business conditions and high unemployment in MDCs. Imports from&#13;
1/ Based on unpublished EEC data.&#13;
2/ Gloves and mittens, men's woven shirts, and knit blouses,&#13;
woven shirts and blouses, trousers and slacks, coats, and&#13;
body support garments for women. Based on data from U.S.&#13;
Department of Commerce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
LDCs (and Japan and CPEs) have become a lightning rod for&#13;
feelings caused by other factors--automation, technical progress,&#13;
e.i.petition among MDC8, etc..&#13;
One result has been greatly intensified pressure for&#13;
protection. In some industries--clothing, textiles, footwear,&#13;
steel--these pressures have succeeded in creating new protective&#13;
measures across a wide front. In others the pressures have been&#13;
generally resisted so far, but scattered inroads have been made.&#13;
The overall outcome still hangs in the balance, with efforts&#13;
being made to stem the tide and add new international agreements,&#13;
as a result of the Tokyo Round.&#13;
Alongside protection, subsidies to industry have reached&#13;
unprecedented proportions in MDC8 and are now a major obstacle&#13;
to LDC exports, especially in Western Europe. Shipbuilding,&#13;
steel and textile products are among the sectors most affected.&#13;
The direct impact of recent increases in protection&#13;
on LDC exports of manufactures will be greatest in clothing, textiles&#13;
and footwear. These products comprised over one-fourth of LDC&#13;
manufactured exports to MDCs in 1975, and (as Table 7 shows) they&#13;
are especially important for the poorer and less industrialized&#13;
LDCs.&#13;
The most severe new restrictions have come in textile&#13;
products, with the European Community leading the way. Principal&#13;
1/ Actual labor displacement by LDC imports appears small compared&#13;
to that resulting from these other influences, based for&#13;
example on estimates in Wolter (1977), Frank (1977) and other&#13;
objective studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4? -&#13;
suppliers have been forced to accept quotas for 1978 in some&#13;
products that are below 1976 levels, and most of the new quotas&#13;
grow through 1982 at low rates in the range from 0.5 to 4% per&#13;
year. Not only have all the significant LDC suppliers in each&#13;
product been hit by quotas but very low "trigger levels" have&#13;
been set for adding quotas against other suppliers if they start&#13;
1/&#13;
to be successful.    New, more severe import restrictions have&#13;
also been created in Canada, Australia, Sweden and Norway. The&#13;
United States, which has had an effective system of quotas up to&#13;
now, has imposed a one-year standstill in its quotas on Hong Kong,&#13;
Taiwan and Korea, holding them in 1978 at 1977 levels; their&#13;
aggregate quotas through 1982 will allow for a combined growth&#13;
rate of just 4.5% per year over 1971 levels in their textile&#13;
2/&#13;
product exports to the U.S.    The combined result will be to&#13;
slow sharply the growth of LDC textile and clothing exports,&#13;
which had kept pace with the overall growth of LDC manufactured&#13;
exports up to 1976.&#13;
To determine the net effect of these changes, the&#13;
World Development Report makes illustrative projections of what&#13;
1/ For example, in each of eight "sensitive" products of Group I,&#13;
which account for over 60% of EEC imports from LDCs by weight,&#13;
a quota will be created against any supplier whose exports&#13;
come to exceed 0.2% of EEC imports from LDCs and CPEs combined.&#13;
In Group II (most other major products) this threshold share&#13;
is 1.2% to 1.5%.&#13;
2/ Based on recent agreements and data in U.S. International Trade&#13;
Commission (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
1975-1985 growth of manufactured exports might be like. This&#13;
growth pattern is compared to 1970-1975 in Table 13. Growth&#13;
of clothing exports is projected conservatively at 5.5% past 1976&#13;
and textiles at 4.5%, as a result of recent increases in protection&#13;
in MDCs.&#13;
Using these projections as a starting point, we get a&#13;
sense of the quantitative importance of protection, at least in&#13;
clothing and textiles. If trade barriers in textile products were&#13;
eased to the point where exports of clothing grew at 15% and&#13;
those of textiles at 12% from 1975-1985, the overall growth rate&#13;
of LDC exports would increase from 6.4% to 6.9% and that for&#13;
exports of manufactures, from 12.2% to 13.5%.&#13;
4. Prospects for Trade Among LDCs. The upsurge of&#13;
protectionist pressures in MDCs intensifies interest in the&#13;
possibilities for accelerated growth of trade among LDCs.&#13;
This trade is already growing at well over 10% per&#13;
year, and the politically realistic possibilities for regional&#13;
common markets, shared industrial plants, etc., are largely&#13;
being exploited. The only way that countries that are far apart&#13;
are likely to open their markets to one another further is&#13;
through reductions of protection in major LDCs on a most-favored-&#13;
nation basis.  This could come about through unilateral shifts&#13;
in policies or through reciprocal concessions in future&#13;
negotiations with MDCs, for example in exchange for reduced NTBs.&#13;
Moderated protection in major LDCs and reduced NTBs in MDCs both&#13;

- 46 -&#13;
appear highly desirable for LDC growth over the long run, and&#13;
would help MDCs as well.&#13;
Along with trade liberalization, expansion of trade&#13;
among LDCs depends also on continuing progress in particular&#13;
markets, for example in making LDCs more competitive in capital&#13;
goods. For the latter purpose, better financing of supplier&#13;
credits and improved information and marketing are examples of&#13;
matters deserving attention. However, it would be unreasonable&#13;
to expect a rapid acceleration of the growth of trade among&#13;
LDCs except as a result of a general liberalization of their&#13;
import restrictions.&#13;
C. The Changing Role of Manufactured Exports&#13;
In the postwar period the possibility of exporting&#13;
manufactured goods to the more advanced countries has done much&#13;
to make possible the emergence of a number of transitional&#13;
countries that are now approaching the status of mature industrial&#13;
economies. Although many of them are small, the group also&#13;
includes several large countries--Spain, Yugoslavia, Brazil,&#13;
Mexico, Korea. Their graduation into the ranks of the MDCs&#13;
could potentially make a substantial change in the world trade&#13;
outlook for the remaining LDCs, yet most of them will still&#13;
have incomes and wages below the MDC average for a long time&#13;
to come. In this concluding section we will speculate on the&#13;
likelihood that manufactured exports can facilitate the growth&#13;
of poor countries and the changes in international policy that&#13;
may be required if this is to take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Success in exporting manufactures--unlike minerals--&#13;
has come largely from a skilled and hard working labor force and&#13;
efficient development policies. There appears to be a strong&#13;
element of learning by doing, which underlies the concentration&#13;
of manufactured exports in a small number of countries. t ce&#13;
countries have acquired this ability, it seems to offset rising&#13;
wages for a considerable period and makes it possible to retain&#13;
their shares of markets in which they would otherwise be losing&#13;
their comparative advantage.&#13;
This cumulative aspect of export performance and the&#13;
increasing number of successful competitors may make it increas-&#13;
ingly difficult for newcombers to get established in the sectors&#13;
in which they have a comparative advantage. Even if transitional&#13;
countries make room, expansion of exports from a few successful&#13;
LDCs could swallow up most of the opportunities, leaving too&#13;
little for the rest of the LDCs.&#13;
If we assume a second-best world in which the advanced&#13;
countries are only willing to move away from unprofitable types&#13;
of manufacturing rather slowly, there is a strong argument for&#13;
favoring the poorest countries in the limited number of sectors&#13;
where they are likely to become efficient exporters. Where the&#13;
export market is already being parceled out by quotas--which&#13;
cannot be avoided in textiles and some agricultural products--&#13;
it may be necessary to redesign quoltas to discriminate systamaticall&#13;
in favor of the least developed and poorest LDCs, if not others&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
that need exports most.&#13;
However, there are also potential dangers for LDCs in&#13;
a systematic attempt to regulate the pattern cf trade:&#13;
(1) Competition to export successfully, under the&#13;
present system, stimulates LDCs to higher standards in their&#13;
policies and economic management, both at the national level&#13;
and at the level of the firm. Would a less competitive approach&#13;
do this and lead to desirable learning effects?&#13;
(2) Any change away from a system of buying goods&#13;
abroad wherever they are most satisfactory seems certain to&#13;
diminish the benefits from trade and make buyers less satisfied&#13;
with imports from LDCs. Is this cost worth the gain to poor&#13;
countries?&#13;
Since the existing trading system has managed to&#13;
accommodate the rapid growth of LDC manufactured exports up to&#13;
now, it may not be easy to strike a balance of these issues.&#13;
However, these are questions that should be of great concern&#13;
to the developing countries in discussing a New International&#13;
Economic Order.&#13;
1/ To some extent "textile" quotas already operate in the&#13;
direction suggested, but they strongly aiscourage new&#13;
exporters from getting started, no matter how badly the&#13;
exports are needed. In the aid field, donor policy has&#13;
already been moving in this direction, but there has&#13;
_ee- less evolution of trade criteria appropriate to&#13;
the transitional status of the middle income countries.&#13;

            The changing composition of developing
            country exports
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper explores the influences that
            have shaped export growth since 1960 and the prospects for
            their further expansion. Particular emphasis is given to
            manufactured exports, which grew more than twice as fast as
            total LDC exports from 1960-75. Manufactured export
            composition and prospects in four groups of LDCs are
            analyzed. A majority of these exports come from a small
            number of countries that have specialized in manufactures
            starting in labor-intensive, technologically stable
            products, using cost-cutting strategy based on low wages,
            while relying heavily on foreign buyers for marketing and
            product design. These countries are now trying to diversify
            into more complex and skill-intensive products. Meanwhile,
            increasing numbers of LDCs not in this group have shifted
            their policies at least part way in an export-oriented
            direction. The rapid increase in manufactures exported from
            LDCs interacting with developed countries' own poor
            economic performance have combined to trigger rising
            protectionism, adding to uncertainties about markets. An
            especially serious aspect of the problem is the effect on
            export prospects of those LDCs that are not yet successful
            exporters of manufactures, but will need to be so to
            facilitate their growth.
