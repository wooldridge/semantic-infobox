&#13;
In November 2007, a group of partner institutions composed of the Inter-American Association of Sanitary&#13;
and Environmental Engineering (AIDIS), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank and&#13;
the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the Water&#13;
and Sanitation Programme (WSP), in concert with the governments of the countries of Latin America, took&#13;
the initiative of compiling a publication to report on the issues, coverage, statistics and recommendations&#13;
relating to sanitation in the region. The objective was to build on the First Latin American Conference on&#13;
Sanitation - LATINOSAN 2007 - that sought to raise awareness of sanitation and to foreground the issue as&#13;
a crucial priority on national and regional agendas. It also offered a valuable opportunity for the exchange of&#13;
experiences, lessons learned and advances made by the countries of the region, showing clearly how close&#13;
they are to meeting the remaining challenges of the Millennium Development Goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Today, as the second anniversary of LATINOSAN 2007 approaches, we believe advances have been made:&#13;
in fact, the first outcome of LATINOSAN was the signing of the Cali declaration, where 16 Latin American&#13;
countries made a commitment to give political priority to the sanitation issue. The basis of these commitments&#13;
lie in three concrete actions: i) prioritising sanitation in national development policies; ii) support for the main&#13;
objectives of the International Year of Sanitation; and iii) strengthening intergovernmental cooperation in the&#13;
region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many countries of the region are currently working on the shared objective of translating the Cali Declaration&#13;
into national and regional actions that will impact on the life and health of the neediest sections of the&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Several initiatives undertaken to date reflect the impact of LATINOSAN at a sub-regional and national level, and&#13;
similar events aimed exclusively at the sanitation situation in the Caribbean are also under way. CARIBSAN&#13;
2008, the Regional Conference on the Integration of Sanitation Policies in National Development Plans in the&#13;
Caribbean Region was held in Kingston, Jamaica from 28 to 29 April 2008, with the key objective to improve&#13;
the wellbeing of the Caribbean population by the integration and development of sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The most important outcome of the CARIBSAN 2008 workshops was the signing of the Kingston&#13;
Recommendations, which contained eight groups of recommendations including real commitments to&#13;
develop national sanitation policies; assess the financial needs and explore alternatives or innovative options&#13;
to ensure increased financial support; increase the awareness and commitment of stakeholders at all levels;&#13;
mobilise governmental counterparts (regional, national and local) and existing alliances; promote sustainable&#13;
and traditional solutions; develop and strengthen human and institutional capacity; increase sustainability as&#13;
well as the effectiveness of available sanitation solutions; and promote and prioritise sanitation at the regional&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Central America, the Central America and Dominican Republic Forum for Water and Sanitation (FOCARD-&#13;
APS) promoted the construction of a National Sanitation Agenda in each of the member nations. This agenda&#13;
outlines clear strategies and concrete actions to be taken by governing bodies, in order to induce large-scale&#13;
change in the basic sanitation situation at the country level, in order to achieve a significant and measurable&#13;
impact on the health and well-being of the population of Central America. The agenda includes the following&#13;
components: a) increased national coverage in basic sanitation, b) improved hygiene practices and c)&#13;
increased coverage in the collection and treatment of solid waste and waste waters.&#13;
                                                                                                                       &amp;#24;&#13;
&amp;#12;    Prologue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In March 2008 FOCARD-APS with the support of WSP, held a regional video conference to launch the&#13;
    International Year of Sanitation with 100 participants from the seven member countries. Similarly, national&#13;
    workshops were held to draw up route maps for sanitation strategies with support from the National water&#13;
    and sanitation networks (RAS-HON in Honduras, RASNIC in Nicaragua, RASGUA in Guatemala and RASES in&#13;
    El Salvador). Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic also outlined their sanitation strategies during&#13;
    the same period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In Honduras, in May 2008, RAS-HON organised the III Forum on Water, Basic and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
    entitled â&#128;&#152;Saneamiento la Agenda Inconclusaâ&#128;&#153; (sanitation - unfinished business) which aimed to promote a&#13;
    national sanitation plan and to encourage the production of policies, strategies and investments in sanitation.&#13;
    Honduras now has a draft strategy that will require the participation and commitment of all institutions linked&#13;
    to the sector - government institutions, NGOs and international bodies â&#128;&#147; in order for it to be fulfilled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Meanwhile, Nicaragua has a Sanitation Action Group comprising government institutions and co-operation&#13;
    agencies dedicated to sanitation development. Similarly, from 10 - 14 of March 2008, the water and sanitation&#13;
    sector held a â&#128;&#152;Sanitation Weekâ&#128;&#153; to promote the role of sanitation in a healthy environment amongst government&#13;
    authorities, organisations and the general public. Events held during the week included presentations of&#13;
    research, conferences, round tables and other activities related to promoting a sanitation culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In Ecuador, the LATINOSAN 2007 conference and the ministerial signing of the commitments produced&#13;
    sufficient drive to place the sanitation issue on the government agenda. National strategy guidelines for the&#13;
    integrated management of solid waste are currently being drawn up in a participatory manner. Field visits were&#13;
    arranged to Brazil and Peru in order for government officials to experience condominium systems in situ; three&#13;
    large workshops were held to disseminate the condominium sewerage model in three regions of Ecuador,&#13;
    with the participation of Ecuadorâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MIDUVI), local government,&#13;
    NGOs, independent consultants and the private sector; and a process is under way to strengthen labour&#13;
    competences in the sector, with engineering and social science professionals recruited to provide training in&#13;
    condominium systems and other water and sanitation issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In Peru and Bolivia the national conferences PERUSAN and BOLIVIASAN were held in November 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The above shows only a small sample of the impact of LATINOSAN 2007 and it is important that we continue&#13;
    to provide new opportunities for interaction between stakeholders in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As a result, we feel sanitation sector stakeholders will be interested to receive this second edition of the&#13;
    document, â&#128;&#152;Sanitation for Development: Progress made in 22 Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
    This report will feed interest in the regionâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation situation by providing updated versions of the country&#13;
    reports presented in the first edition and by including the Jamaican report missing from the previous edition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    This publication has been inspired by the urgent need for a better understanding of the sanitation situation&#13;
    in Latin America and the Caribbean. More than 900 participants attended LATINOSAN 2007 and we saw&#13;
    the inception of professional and institutional alliances on sanitation related actions; we witnessed the birth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#24;&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                          Prologue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of initiatives planning similar opportunities for dialogue in other countries of the region, and we increased our&#13;
knowledge by seeing more than 60 presentations and reports on successful experiences shared during the&#13;
conference. In the light of this enthusiasm and activity, we believe this document will once more contribute to&#13;
the productivity of any action undertaken in the quest for universal sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Once again, I would like to thank those contributors who made the initial publication of the document possible,&#13;
and also the professionals and institutions - in governments and the international co-operation agencies - who&#13;
responded to our call and helped provide updates for the second edition, revising any content that may have&#13;
held involuntary inaccuracies in the information originally received from each country.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The most recent available figures indicate that 20 million people in the country were not covered by safe excreta&#13;
    disposal in 2001. Given population projections for 2015, and in accordance with the MDGs it is hoped that around&#13;
    11.5 million people will have sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Estimated investment of US$ 19.2 billion would be needed to complete safe excreta disposal systems. The&#13;
    Federal Health Council (CONFESA) has also projected that investment of US$ 13 billion would be needed to&#13;
    achieve the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Up until October 2007, the number of people lacking coverage had fallen by 8 million and although there is no&#13;
    long-term plan, the goals of the APLA Plan that runs until 2011 state that 9 million people will be served. This has&#13;
    implied investments of US$ 1.83 billion from 2003 to 2007 and has benefited 6.5 million people.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Programmes to improve sanitation indicators in Argentina include PROARSA (subsidies through recovery funds&#13;
    up to US$ 500,000); the â&#128;&#152;Agua + Trabajoâ&#128;&#153; programme (subsidies to municipal governments); PROMES (National&#13;
    Treasury loans); IDB VI (finalised in June 2005); IBRD 4484 (finalised in July 2007); and PROESA (special sanitation&#13;
    programmes with National Treasury funds). These have received investment of US$ 489 million and a total of 7&#13;
    million people have benefited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Lack of specific policies and strategies for the sector, both at national and provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 History of instability in long-term policies for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 High turnover in institutions and technical teams.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Insufficient resources (human, material and organisational).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Following the crisis of 2001 and 2002, strategies were focused on dealing with the emergency, channelling&#13;
              subsidised investment into existing projects fostering inefficient resource distribution.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 From 2007, the new Government identified the need for planning in the sector and the design of public&#13;
              policies which became an established objective.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Some plans (for example the â&#128;&#152;Agua + Trabajoâ&#128;&#153; programme) set out strategies for public investment, which&#13;
              include employment opportunities for the unemployed or those receiving social benefits, which can be&#13;
              interpreted as a poverty reduction impact mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Sector policies and strategies have not yet been developed in relation to hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
              education; the disposal of excreta, the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and&#13;
              solid waste; and the treatment of waste water.&#13;

            ENOHSA standards (voluntary, used nationally);&#13;
                                                                          application.&#13;

&#13;

            No specialised regulations have been developed for health promotion and sanitation education, or for the reuse&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Each provincial jurisdiction has its own institutional framework as this is a country politically divided into&#13;
     federal entities under the Constitution. In 14 of the 24 provinces there are regulatory bodies and most of these&#13;

â&#128;¢	 As yet, there has been no division of roles in terms&#13;
                                                                               framework for solid waste management&#13;
     of governance and regulation in the sector. However,&#13;
                                                                               1. The existence of a National Law of&#13;
     service provision has been separated and the roles are&#13;
                                                                                   Minimum Budgets was not accepted by&#13;
     exercised by local institutions.&#13;
                                                                                   all provinces.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are no platforms for coordination on this issue. In&#13;
                                                                               2. Municipal authorities are responsible for&#13;
     some provinces, there are provincial plans, but levels of&#13;
                                                                                   solid waste management.&#13;
     fulfilment are low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
In general, there is no hygiene promotion and sanitation education programme nor is there a specialist institution&#13;
to execute it. Individual initiatives have been provided by service providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
     1. A regulatory programme must be designed for hygiene promotion and sanitation education.&#13;
&#13;
     2. It has not been possible to measure results due to the diffuse nature of activities.&#13;
                                                                                                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;            4. Funding&#13;
Argentina&#13;
            Subsidy policies have been developed, as have: cost&#13;
            recovery and tariffs for excreta disposal; the treatment      Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
            of waste water; and the collection, treatment and             1. Lack of efficient allocation of scarce resour-&#13;
            sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste;              ces to meet the MDGs.&#13;
            meanwhile these types of policies have not been&#13;
                                                                          2. Lack of medium and long-term financial&#13;
            planned for health promotion and sanitation education.&#13;
                                                                             planning.&#13;
            Each institution has created its own monitoring system&#13;
            in order to monitor finances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
            There are no national indicators. Given the lack of specific information systems for the sector, the data from the&#13;
            2001 National Census of Population Homes and Houses is used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
               1. There are no regulatory frameworks to strengthen operations in institutions.&#13;
&#13;
               2. The regulatory function is generally not independent of the current government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 There is great concern over the lack of trained staff in the various participating sectors (universities, public&#13;
              bodies and the private sector).&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 It is believed that the necessary technology is available to achieve the Millennium Goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
                1. There is no policy to promote development of available staff in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
                2. There is no relevant investment in research and development.&#13;

    â&#128;¢	 ENOHSA must administer resources for funding the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Successful experience: Drinking Water and Drainage for smaller communities programme&#13;
&#13;
A large part of the resources provided by IDB funding were used in the sanitation sector in Argentina in&#13;
locations with populations of less than 15,000 through stages I to VI of the Drinking Water and Drainage&#13;
Programme, through which US$ 423.2 million was spent to the benefit of around 2 million people. In Stage&#13;
VI alone, locations with a population of between 500 and 15,000 people were provided with drinking water&#13;
and sanitation services. A total of 103 projects were funded in 101 locations in 16 of the 23 provinces of&#13;
the country. Funding was provided for 62 sanitary drainage systems, 37 drinking water systems, mainly&#13;
extensions of existing systems, and for combined drinking water and sanitation systems, benefiting some&#13;
710,000 people. This resulted in achievement of 93% of targets in the number of systems planned, exceeding&#13;
targets in terms of the size of the beneficiary population. Similarly, drinking water coverage in these locations&#13;
was increased from 78% to 83.6% and sanitation coverage from 10% to 20%.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In order to meet the MDGs and national targets, Bolivia must increase sanitary disposal of excreta from 51% to&#13;
     64%; treatment from 39% to 57%; and solid waste collection from 66% to 90%. Investment of US$ 494 million&#13;
     is required, or US$ 62 million per year on average, for the reconditioning of systems and community hygiene and&#13;
     development actions. Past investments in sanitation have been low and the sector requires almost double the&#13;
     financial resources and number of projects.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Policies contained in the National Development Plan and the Plan Sectorial Agua para la Gente water sector&#13;
     plan state that i) water is in the public domain; its provision and monitoring is a State responsibility; water use&#13;
     must be sustainable; it must also be prioritised for human consumption and irrigation; there must be respect&#13;
     for the customary use of water granted to the people, indigenous and rural communities; and ii) the provision of&#13;
     drinking water and sanitation services must be carried out with direct State participation, without exposure to&#13;
     the principles of supply and demand.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The strategy for the sector aims at full customary access to water and sanitation through increased service&#13;
     coverage, with programmes in urban, periurban and rural areas, in villages, and the territories of indigenous&#13;
     and native peoples. It also considers investments in geographical socio-productive enclaves and environmental&#13;
     management with the national programme for solid waste management and waste water treatment plants&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Development Plan sets investment budgets for the various programmes which are executed through&#13;
     sectoral financial policy and resource attribution mechanisms based on lack of coverage and poverty factors.&#13;
&#13;

Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities&#13;
&#13;
The current policy framework proposes:&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Access to services within the framework of integrated management of water resources and water catchment&#13;
     areas.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 User participation, transparency, social equity and justice respecting traditional uses and customs.&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The importance of sanitation has been highlighted in the National Development Plan which establishes&#13;
   universal access to services, State participation in the provision and increase of coverage through specific&#13;
   programmes relating to i) sanitary excreta disposal with the emphasis on access by the poorest sectors; ii)&#13;
   waste water treatment and the improvement and extension of sanitary landfill services within the framework&#13;
   of environmental management for the protection, preservation and sustainable exploitation of water&#13;
   resources; and iii) investments in socio-productive enclaves.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Additionally, health promotion and the right of access to sanitation have been prioritised as a determining&#13;
   factor for health.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sector policies and strategies have been established on hygiene promotion and sanitation education;&#13;
   excreta disposal; the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste; and the treatment of waste&#13;
   water. Meanwhile, policies related to the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage sludge are under&#13;
   development.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sector policies set specific objectives&#13;
   for more vulnerable populations like            Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
   indigenous peoples, those settled in&#13;

   sparsely   populated   rural   areas   and&#13;
   marginal urban areas, as well as for the        2. Sanitation policies are not integrated with other&#13;
   treatment of waste water, solid waste and          complementary sectors.&#13;
   socio-productive enclaves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Legislation and some regulations are in place on: hy-&#13;
giene promotion and sanitation education; excreta            Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
disposal; waste water treatment; the collection, treat-&#13;
                                                             1. Regulation of the sector laws.&#13;
ment and sanitary disposal of solid waste; monitoring&#13;
of contamination in water courses; and the reuse of          2. Complementary standards on sludge, solid&#13;
&#13;
sewage sludge, municipal waste water and solid was-             waste and the reuse of waste water and&#13;
&#13;
te. However, regulations on the collection, treatment           excreta.&#13;
&#13;
and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and the reuse&#13;
of human excreta are still under development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The regulatory roles of the Ministry of Water and Vice-ministry of Basic Services MDA/VSB, SISAB regulations&#13;
and the drinking water and sanitation service providers (EPSAs) are defined, but are only partially fulfilled.&#13;
Sludge management does not have a specific regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Platforms for coordination between stakeholders.&#13;
The main platforms include the Consejo Interinstitucional del Agua (CONIAG), the Government-Sector&#13;
Cooperation Board, departmental platforms, mancomunidades (associations of municipalities), municipal and&#13;
operator associations, and the water and hygiene forum.                                                           17&#13;

              3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
              Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education form part of investment programmes in the sector but the&#13;
                  results have not been sufficiently evaluated. The health sector has several national programmes working on&#13;
                  this issue.&#13;
&#13;
     18&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 These programmes are run by MDA/VSB and the Ministry of Health and Sport (MSD), PROANDES/UNICEF,&#13;
     ACDI/VOCA, FHI/Bolivia, Save the Children, PROAPAC, Plan International, ADRA, CARE, Sumaj Huasi	                                                         Bolivia&#13;
     and others. Evaluations indicate that hygiene promotion and sanitation education have not achieved	&#13;
     the desired impact. UNICEF indicators show that the use of latrines only reaches 40% in the rural	&#13;
     sector nationally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
    1. Interventions in hygiene promotion and sanitation education have not been given the necessary&#13;
          institutional support and they have not developed sufficient local and community capacity.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Sector policies have not included sufficient action for hygiene promotion and sanitation education,&#13;
          nor have intersector actions occurred with health and education. This limits the demand for and&#13;
          sustainability of sanitation services.&#13;

&#13;
Subsidies are available for investment in hygiene promotion, excreta disposal, waste water treatment, while&#13;
this type of policy is not available for the collection of sewage sludge. Municipal subsidies exist for services&#13;
related to solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VSB is responsible for physical and financial monitoring except for solid waste. The Vice ministry of Public&#13;
Funding (VIPFE) collects data and processes investment information and the economic and social analysis&#13;
entity UDAPE monitors the MDGs and national targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. City councils and municipal authorities provide low levels of funding for the subsector, even though&#13;
          both institutions have been given larger budgets. Tariffs and rates for sanitation services and solid&#13;
          waste are not sufficient for sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Funding of US$ 36 million is being negotiated for the sector, but this is insufficient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                              19&#13;
&amp;#12;          5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
Bolivia&#13;
          National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
          The main indicators include coverage for the disposal of excreta in all forms; waste water treatment; the quality&#13;
          of sanitary effluent entering the excreta network and the quality of effluent from treatment plants. Moreover, the&#13;
          coverage of collection and final disposal of solid waste services is also measured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          VSB has developed a water and sanitation information system (SIAS), but this has been discontinued and&#13;
          does not include solid waste or hygiene promotion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
          Sanitation is identified as a determining factor      Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and&#13;
                                                                evaluation&#13;
          in health policies and programmes, but no&#13;
          analytical tools incorporate this element.            1. No recent official information is available for the&#13;
&#13;
          Sanitation is also considered when drawing                sector.&#13;
&#13;
          up environmental data, and in the indicator of        2. There is no compatible monitoring system that&#13;
          unsatisfied basic needs (UBN).                            correlates advances in sanitation coverage and&#13;
                                                                    impacts on health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
          Sector policy has initiated the process of making this operational and providing technical assistance through&#13;
          FUNDASAB and other involved parties, in order to organise capacity development. VSB/PROAGUAS have&#13;
          complied an important resource for the country that identifies sources of information and technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
          Appropriate technologies are available and so are methodologies for hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
          education, except for the management of dangerous waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
             1. Urban sanitation staff are underused. In the rural area, there are insufficient resources to ensure&#13;
                community development and the operation and maintenance of systems.&#13;
&#13;
             2. Technical support must be consolidated in order to ensure the sustainability of investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Establish specific policies to eliminate bars on access to sanitation and to approach the subsidised&#13;
                funding of domestic sanitation installations for the lower income population. Define specific strategies&#13;
                for the disposal and treatment of liquid waste and put solid waste systems into operation.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Establish planning policies for urban and rural areas that facilitate greater organisation in the rural area&#13;
                and the legalisation of sites in periurban areas.&#13;
     20&#13;
&amp;#12;   â&#128;¢	 Include effective intersector actions in coordination with health and education aspects of social&#13;
     intervention strategies. Municipal and city administrations must all work in an integrated manner, in line   Bolivia&#13;
     with policies and strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Complete laws and regulations in the legal framework for sector services, funding, community&#13;
     development and solid waste.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Produce and promote regulations for: the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge;&#13;
     the reuse of excreta, sewage sludge and municipal waste water; and the reuse and recycling of solid&#13;
     waste.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Seek consensus with social organisations and other institutions involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of waste&#13;
     water&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion must be the responsibility of an inter-agency commission involving the MDA/VSB,&#13;
     Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The programme must be executed with a greater input from social organisations, teachers and health&#13;
     centres.&#13;
&#13;
  3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Review of the institutional framework, considering an intersector approach and outlining stakeholder&#13;
     competences and attributions.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Regulate the solid waste sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Establish a legal instrument to ensure that city councils and municipal authorities assume their&#13;
     responsibilities in sanitation, allocating a fixed percentage of resources to fulfilment of the MDGs.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The VSB must work to prepare an investment plan for resource management supportive of sanitation&#13;
     development principally aiming to subsidise city municipal authorities in smaller towns and rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Realignment of the sector information system, inclusion of solid waste and community development&#13;
     (DESCOM). Organise and complement the sector information system with the National Institute of&#13;
     Statistics (INE).&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Request information from service providers, municipal authorities, NGOs and others and put this into&#13;
     operation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Specialist staff and funds are needed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop institutional capacity and local staff, especially in rural areas, increasing sanitation coverage&#13;
     within the framework of integrated management and community development with the participation of&#13;
     health and education personnel.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Provide adequate funding for technical assistance mechanisms and organise, coordinate and execute&#13;
     alliances with institutions involved in institutional strengthening, technical assistance and training.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthen MDA/VSB with the necessary staff and funding.&#13;
                                                                                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;          Successful experience: Trinidad drainage system&#13;
Bolivia   The Trinidad Drinking Water and Drainage Cooperative (COATRI) serves a city of 89,000 people, and spent four years&#13;
          on building a drainage system that only achieved 23% coverage. In 2006, the city council, the municipal authorities&#13;
          and COATRI signed an agreement to add users to the drainage service and created a rotating fund offering interest&#13;
          free loans over four years. To date, COATRI has completed 2,600 of the 4,600 planned connections.&#13;
&#13;
          The programme also includes technical assistance in building sanitation modules. This experience reveals that&#13;
          organised work between service operators, municipal authorities and the city council can generate widespread&#13;
          benefits.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In Brazil 67.2% of the population have access to waste water collection; 77.3% in urban areas and 18.5% in rural&#13;
    areas. The MDGs indicate that by 2015, 69.7% of the population should have access to these services, which&#13;
    means Brazil will be close to achieving that goal.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 National directives for the provision of water services, sewerage, the management of solid waste and rainwater&#13;
    were approved in January 2007; the creation of the Growth Acceleration Programme (PAC), which established&#13;
    investments of US$ 22.4 billion1, between 2007 and 2010, so that 55% of homes will be connected to sewerage&#13;
    networks and 47% will have adequate disposal of solid waste; and the establishment of management of public&#13;
    services through the contracting of public consortiums are all aspects which mark the new climate of sanitation&#13;
    in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The main programmes and actions are under way to achieve the MDGs include: the Sanitation for All programme&#13;
    which finances sanitation works in public and private sectors, in order to promote increased coverage and the&#13;
    quality of water, sewerage, rainwater drainage and solid urban waste services; the PAT-PROSANEAR technical&#13;
    assistance programme for the sanitation project and that provides technical and financial support to state&#13;
    and municipal authorities in drawing up the PSI (recovery of degraded urban areas, definition of actions and&#13;
    interventions for integral development of the area and the search for mechanisms to make this feasible): and&#13;
    PDLI (actions necessary for environmental preservation, agricultural organisation and land use and occupation&#13;
    regulations) in towns with more than 75,000 people or members of metropolitan regions; the interministerial&#13;
    Rural Sanitation Programme to extend coverage and improve the quality of environmental sanitation services in&#13;
    rural areas; the Water Sector Modernisation Programme PMSS - aiming to improve conditions, encouraging an&#13;
    environment of change and development in the sanitation sector in the country, the improvement of the quality&#13;
    of life, the level of efficiency and effectiveness in service provision; a sustainable urban drainage programme - a&#13;
    shared initiative between the Ministry of Cities, FUNASA and the Ministry of National Integration - to promote&#13;
    sustainable management of urban drainage with actions directed to preservation, control and minimisation of&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
          Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 The PAC growth acceleration plan made rules for the fiscal regime more flexible allowing states and municipal&#13;
            authorities to receive new loans for investments in the expansion and improvement of sanitation services in&#13;
            the country. This is only valid for the 2007 to 2010 period, whereby there is no guarantee that this pattern&#13;
            of investment in the sector will be continued.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Difficulty in implementing the large investments, due to an absence of planning in most states and municipal&#13;
            areas in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Regional differences in the performance of service providers. There is no adequate sewage sludge&#13;
            management and collection, and sewage sludge treatment is also lacking.&#13;
&#13;
          Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Homes situated in non-urban areas of towns or villages have the worst indicators for access to sanitation:&#13;
            little over half (52.5%) have access to water supplies and only a fifth (20.4%) are attached to sewerage&#13;
            systems.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 Some 72.4% of families with incomes equivalent to 4.5 minimum salaries or more have access to sewerage,&#13;
  and 95% have access to solid waste collection. This demonstrates the high correlation between access and              Brazil&#13;
  income levels.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Racial minorities have low levels of access, showing that access is also closely related to colour and race&#13;
  issues. Similarly, the higher the level of education, the higher the percentage of access to sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In municipal areas in the north of Brazil, only 11.6% of homes have access to sewerage systems. There is a&#13;
  similar low level of access for homes in the north-east of the country.&#13;

Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation effectively became a public policy priority in Brazil in recent years, as was shown in the approval of&#13;
  a new legal framework for the provision of services in January 2007 and the significant increase in availability&#13;
  of resources. Moreover, in the 2003 to 2006 period&#13;
  investments of US% 6.8 billion were made, of which US$&#13;
  3.2 billion are non-repayable. Investments of US$ 22.3&#13;
  billion are expected for the 2007 to 2010 period.                  Critical aspects of sanitation policies&#13;
                                                                     and strategies&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sector policies and strategies are in place on: hygiene           1. Absence of a culture of planning and&#13;
  promotion and sanitation education; excreta disposal,                 regulation of services.&#13;
  the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage&#13;
                                                                     2. Lack of a sustainable long-term policy&#13;
  sludge and solid waste; and the treatment of waste&#13;
                                                                        for investments in the sector.&#13;
  water.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Law 11.445 states policies for water supply, sewerage,&#13;
  the management of solid waste and rainwater must be&#13;
  established in coordination with national, regional and municipal sanitation plans.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The increased availability of resources for sanitation from 2003, reinforced during the 2007 to 2010 period,&#13;
  forms part of a wider development strategy established by the Federal Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
Special regulations have been developed for health promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of excreta;&#13;
the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; the treatment of waste water;&#13;
the reuse of human excreta, sewage sludge, municipal waste water and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
   1. Law 11.445 needs national regulations.&#13;
&#13;
   2. There is no definition of tenure for service provision in metropolitan regions. The decision-making&#13;
      process is the responsibility of the Supreme Federal Tribunal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                       25&#13;

&#13;
                               The Council of Cities, ConCidades, was created in 2004. It is a collegiate body of the Ministry of Cities&#13;
                               with a remit to study and propose directives for the formulation and implementation of the National Urban&#13;
                               Development Programme (PNDU), and to accompany its execution. ConCidades is a forum for negotiation&#13;
                               where social stakeholders participate in the decision-making process on Ministry of Cities policies in housing,&#13;
                               environmental sanitation, transport, urban mobility and land use planning.&#13;

&#13;
                                 1. Inadequate integration of policies and governmental actors.&#13;
&#13;
                                 2. The regulation of service provision is insufficient and precarious.&#13;

&#13;
                               As well as ConCidades, the National Environmental System (SISNAMA) takes action through the co-ordinated&#13;
                               organisation of its constituent bodies and entities, monitoring public access to information on damage to the&#13;
                               environment and environmental protection actions in accordance with the model developed by the National&#13;
                               Environmental Council (CONAMA).&#13;
&#13;
                               State government, the Federal district and municipal authorities are responsible for implementing the&#13;
                               measures produced by SISNAMA in their region, producing standards and supplementary and complimentary&#13;

                                 Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
                                 1. Limited funding of services for the collection, treatment and final disposal of waste.&#13;
&#13;
                                 2. Lack of organisation and management of service providers for the collection, treatment and final&#13;

&#13;
            Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
            1. Funding restrictions are in place.&#13;
&#13;
            2. Most solid waste collection service providers charge a rate that does not cover the costs.&#13;

          6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
          The country is working on a comparison of existing staff (governmental institutions, universities, training	&#13;
          and research centres, and the private sector) with the appropriately trained staff required in order to achieve&#13;
          the MDGs in sanitation, hygiene promotion and sanitation education. Similarly, the necessary technologies	&#13;
          are available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
            1. Deficiencies in the management of sewerage services.&#13;
&#13;
            2. Deficiencies in the capacity to implement investment projects.&#13;

          Successful experience: Recycling Lives.&#13;
          Selective collection of solid waste in the Londrina municipality&#13;
&#13;
          The Municipal Selective Collection Programme â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#152;Recycling Livesâ&#128;&#153; run by the local council of Londrina is&#13;
          recognized nationally for its efficiency, and for viewing recycling operators as valuable citizens who provide&#13;
          an asset to the city. The local council transport and urbanisation department set up the selective collection&#13;
          programme in 2001. The system is based on manual house-to-house collection with the general public acti-&#13;
          vely participating by separating their waste as they dispose of it at home, delivering clean recyclable materials&#13;
          to the collectors. This offers the street rubbish collectors the opportunity to recycle products through local&#13;
          recycling NGOs, generating income and social inclusion. The municipal council supplies green bags and helps&#13;
          with transportation of the material collected to sorting facilities. In each region, the recycling operative calls at&#13;
          each house at least once a week, providing an empty green bag to replace the full bag containing materials&#13;
          sorted during the week. The recyclable materials are already clean and only need to be sorted in order to be&#13;
          sold. One of the great advances was the union of NGOs with the compaction, weight and sales unit CEPEVE,&#13;
          as the amount of recyclable material collected adds value at the point of sale, reducing the action of interme-&#13;
          diaries and guaranteeing the highest possible value for each item sold.&#13;

1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The urban population have coverage of 95.2% in sewerage. However, some homes are still not connected, even&#13;
    when the service runs close to them. Coverage for waste water treatment is currently 84.3%. The national target&#13;
    for the end of 2009 is for all water collected in sewerage systems to be treated.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 A large number of rural settlements had sewerage and waste water treatment systems at the end of 2006.&#13;
    However, it is not possible to give a precise number as the systems have not always been built by municipal&#13;
    authorities. The regional development department (SUBDERE) of the Ministry of the Interior is compiling a study&#13;
    on the current situation of wastewater systems in rural areas. Rural locations without waste water collection and&#13;
    treatment systems generally have individual solutions for the disposal of excreta and waste water through septic&#13;
    tank systems and soak away pits or sanitary latrines.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 As a result of the above, it is possible to state that national sanitation targets will be met.&#13;

2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
There is no institution responsible for waste water in the rural sector or for the drinking water service in sparsely&#13;
settled rural areas. A Bill currently working its way through parliament that will establish an institution to adequately&#13;
approach pending objectives in drinking water supply and sanitation in the rural sector. This institution will take an&#13;
integrated approach to sanitation in rural areas.&#13;

         Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
         There are no inequities in access to drinking water, except for those people settled in informal settlements&#13;
         where it that takes some time for the situation to become formalised and for them to be supplied by the&#13;
         corresponding urban settlement.&#13;
&#13;
         The demands for drinking water quality are the same in all services in the country as there is a single quality&#13;
         standard that must be fulfilled by all drinking water suppliers, both urban and rural.&#13;
&#13;
         The systems are generally considered adequate by users. However, there are isolated incidences of clandestine&#13;
         connections to the sewerage services that occasionally lead to blockages due to inappropriate use.&#13;

         Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Sanitation is very important for the country and this is reflected in current levels of coverage and investment.&#13;
                        Sector policies and strategies are in place on the disposal of excreta and the collection and treatment&#13;
                        of waste water. Sludge from the treatment of waste water is mostly disposed of in sanitary landfill and&#13;
                        mono-landfill. Regulations are being produced for the management and reuse of the sludge produced by&#13;
                        wastewater treatment plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    34&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 The construction of sewerage systems in rural sectors aims to improve the living conditions of the lower&#13;
  income population, especially in terms of excreta disposal. Policies and strategies related to the management    Chile&#13;
  of sewage sludge, the treatment of waste water and the management of solid waste are linked with&#13;
  environmental protection and economic development policies.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Since January 2005 Chile has used an integrated waste management plan approved by the National&#13;
  Environmental Commission (CONAMA). This public policy comes under the environmental protection policy&#13;
  and establishes the general objective of forms of solid waste management that present the minimum risk to&#13;
  the health of the population and the environment, offering an integrated perspective on waste that ensures&#13;
  sustainable and efficient development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   1. Construction of rural sewerage systems is not supported by an institutional framework that would&#13;
      ensure their operation and maintenance, adequate planning, efficiency in the use of resources and&#13;
      use of appropriate technologies.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Reuse of sludge generated in wastewater treatment is restricted by the very heavy demands in&#13;
      regulations currently under discussion. This has hampered implementation.&#13;

                                                                                               agreement on the minimum requirements for the use of&#13;

                 must be fulfilled. Similarly, it has not been considered necessary to develop regulations for the reuse of human&#13;
                 excreta except for treated sludge from wastewater treatment plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 3.1	 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
                 Concessionaries (sanitation companies) operate the drainage systems, whereby they are responsible for the&#13;
                 disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and the treatment of waste water. The Superintendence&#13;
                 of Sanitation Services (SISS) funds them and CONAMA grants the environmental permits for any projects that&#13;
                 may affect the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 In the rural sector, the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for running the National Programme for&#13;
                 Rural Drinking Water, and that includes the tasks of planning and execution of the services. This is operated&#13;
                 by committees or co-operatives made up of representatives elected from amongst the end users. In those&#13;
                 areas where there is no concession (the rural sector), sanitation is regulated and funded by the Health Ministry.&#13;
                 There is coordination between MOP and municipal authorities in some cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Platforms for coordination between stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
                 As part of the evaluation process for the granting of environmental permits, CONAMA consults all state entities&#13;
                 related to the projects. These can include the Ministry of Health, MOP, the Ministry of Agriculture (SAG), the&#13;
                 Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and municipal authorities.&#13;

The treatment of domestic solid waste is regulated by a heterogeneous group of standards, which establish&#13;
rules for management and monitoring across a broad group of ministries and public entities. In general, there&#13;
is no particular institution with specific responsibility or competence over the group of solid waste management&#13;
tasks, either from the perspective of the environmental and sanitation aspects, or from the economic point of&#13;
view. Moreover, on certain issues there is no clear idea of which institution is responsible or has been allocated&#13;
the task.&#13;
&#13;
The current institutional establishment does not have a higher level entity politically responsible for implementing&#13;
a strategy for solid waste management. This deficient institutional situation has meant waste management&#13;
has not been given the due, unique and exclusive attention it deserves when sanitation and environmental&#13;
problems have made themselves evident.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of the Interior acts through the municipal authorities, who are legally responsible for the collection,&#13;
transportation and final disposal of domestic solid waste. This waste is generated by trade, waste from public&#13;
highways, and public leisure spaces. The Ministry of the General Secretariat of the Presidency acts through&#13;
CONAMA.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
     1. Lack of capacity and coordination at various levels in the planning, supervision and monitoring&#13;
          of policies and standards existing on the matter of waste, as well as the inexistence of an entity&#13;
          responsible for centralising and processing information generated by the various competent bodies.&#13;
          Excessive delays in the production and processing of the required sanitation and environmental&#13;
          standards.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Insufficient environmental education, both at the level of public and private institutions and among the&#13;
          general public. Similarly, it has not been possible to promote a long-term nationwide policy on waste&#13;
          reduction.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                            37&#13;
&amp;#12;         3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
Chile&#13;
         Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the&#13;
         country&#13;
&#13;
         The Ministry of Health is responsible for hygiene programmes and sanitation education in the country and in&#13;
         2002 it produced a document on sanitation objectives for 2000-2010, which set targets for basic sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         According to information from SISS, investments of US$ 860.7 million are planned in concessions granted&#13;
         for drinking water provision and the collection and treatment of waste water within the public sanitation&#13;
         services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Policies have been developed for: subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
         education; the disposal of excreta; the treatment of waste water; and the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
         disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In the specific area of solid domestic waste, the tariff system is decided through the Municipal Income Law that&#13;
         states that the municipal authorities are responsible for deciding the real cost of domestic waste services each&#13;
         year and for establishing the tariffs applicable to&#13;
         users of these services. The real costs are not&#13;
         transferred effectively to service users as the        Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
         waste service tariff is calculated equally for all&#13;
                                                                1. In the case of solid waste, the current method of&#13;
         users of the service (a flat rate).&#13;
                                                                   calculating tariffs means there is no incentive for&#13;
                                                                   waste reduction and recycling at present.&#13;
         Meanwhile, the Municipal Income Law states&#13;
         that all users whose home or housing units&#13;
         worth 225 Monthly Tax Units (UTMs) or less are&#13;
         exempt from paying water charges. Furthermore, for service users who are exempt from the payment of&#13;
         Local Land Tax (contributions), the Law states that the municipal authority must think of an efficient system for&#13;
         charging for water charges. In richer municipal areas, most users pay their water charges as part of the Local&#13;
         Land Tax - a tax that is generally paid by most of the wealthier population - whereby the municipal authority&#13;
         effectively operates as an intermediary between the user and the water service provider. In the case of poorer&#13;
         communes, the municipal authority does not totally transfer the cost of waste disposal due to the higher&#13;
         exemption levels, whereby it is forced to become a user of the system itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
         National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
         All indicators for coverage, service quality and fulfilment of requirements in the sanitation sector in Chile&#13;
         (sanitation companies, concessions sectors) are summed up in the management report, presented	&#13;
         yearly by SISS. Information on rural systems is spread between MOP, the Ministry of Health and some&#13;
         municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
         Sanitation indicators are related to monitoring in public health programmes, especially those related to the&#13;
         reduction of epidemic outbreaks of typhoid and paratyphoid fever, hepatitis A and diarrhoea.&#13;
    38&#13;
&amp;#12;6. Capacities&#13;
                                                                                                                  Chile&#13;
Chile has sufficient trained professionals to achieve the MDGs and national targets. The fulfilment of commit-&#13;
ments will depend on how many of the necessary responsibilities are attributed and institutional frameworks&#13;
provided. The technology needed to achieve the goals is also available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Successful experience: Local companies in sanitation. The case of COOPAGUA&#13;
&#13;
The Cooperativa de Agua Potable Santo Domingo Ltda (COOPAGUA) is a group of 1,750 members that&#13;
has provided permanent drinking water and sewerage systems to more than 3,000 homes in the commune&#13;
of Santo Domingo, San Antonio province since 1974.&#13;
&#13;
It employs 61 people and is a non-profit entity. The revenues from services amount to an annual income&#13;
of US$ 1.5 million, and profits exceeding US$ 250,000 per year, and these are entirely reinvested in water&#13;
and sanitation works. It has a drinking water plant that produces 200 l/s, and two waste water treatment&#13;
plants of 20 l/s, and 16 l/s respectively. The drinking water treatment and sewerage systems are advancing&#13;
in line with the Development Plan agreed with SISS. Some 62% of their clients are connected to the&#13;
sewerage system, and it is expected that 100% of clients will have access to the service by 2010. Its home&#13;
service Serviciohogar is free to members and deals with any minor domestic repairs to pipes and sewage&#13;
installations within the property.&#13;
&#13;
The commune will also be starting a water resources conservation project in a joint Water Education&#13;
campaign with UNESCO as part of the Culture Programme. In 2007, for the fifth consecutive year, SISS&#13;
rated COOPAGUA first in the annual evaluation of performance and quality in drinking water and sewerage&#13;
systems.&#13;

    85.9% and 92.4% for the urban sector and 66.6% for the rural areas. MDG goals for sewerage system coverage&#13;
    for 2015 and 2019 - the bicentenary of the independence of Colombia - proposed by the National Government&#13;
    aim for 97.6% in urban areas and 70.9% for the rural sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Around 410 waste water systems have been built in 354 municipal areas, a figure which represents 32.2% of all&#13;
    municipal areas. However, the percentage of a real impact of Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Total Suspended&#13;
    Solids are not known, nor are the levels of operation and coverage of the sewerage network that discharges&#13;
    into the system, or the amount of industrial waste waters dumped into the network or into bodies of water. It is&#13;
    estimated that only 33% of systems operate adequately. Around 8% of urban waste water was treated in 2003&#13;
    and National Government has set a target of 30% urban coverage by 2010 and 50% by 2019.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In December 2006, 80 9% of solid waste (21,940 tonnes/day in 643 municipal areas) were disposed of&#13;
    adequately and a further 11% (2,676 tonnes/day), inadequately. Targets set by National Government in the&#13;
    National Development Plan 2006-2010 aim for 135 municipal authorities to have access to sites technically&#13;
    suited to the final disposal of solid waste (sanitary landfill or transitional cells).&#13;

2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There must be improved awareness of the MDGs amongst the different stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Territorial entities must internalise the action needed to achieve the MDGs within their development plans.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Coverage of the sewerage system must be extended before investing in waste water treatment systems.&#13;

           â&#128;¢	 Tariff calculation methods could allow for municipal authorities with high levels of political influence to refuse&#13;
                          to build water treatment plants in order not to increase tariffs to users for this service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Although significant increases have been made in the coverage of the sewerage system on a national level,&#13;
                          large differences still persist between regions. In some departments, coverage is above 83%, while in others&#13;
                          it is less than 36%. In the capital, coverage is close to 100%.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 General Participation System (SGP) resources - the main source of funding for the sector -are not being&#13;
                          invested optimally. The cost of service provision varies widely between cities -due to the topographical&#13;
                          conditions and energy costs- leading to marked differences in tariffs between cities.&#13;

           Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 The objective of the sector policy proposed by the Vice Ministry of Water and Sanitation (VAS) is to provide&#13;
                          the tools to ensure the efficient provision of services of clean water supplies, sewerage and cleaning for all&#13;
                          Colombians. Sector policies and strategies are in place on: the disposal of excreta; waste water treatment;&#13;
                          the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 In 2005, National Government set targets and strategies for Colombia, including national targets for basic&#13;
                          sanitation in order to achieve the MDGs for 2015, through the National Council of Economic and Social&#13;
                          Policy (CONPES) Social 091 document. In order to improve conditions for families living in extreme poverty,&#13;
                          National Government also created the Network to Overcome Extreme Poverty. Action by the network led to&#13;
                          54 achievements, grouped in nine sections, including health, nutrition and habitability. The latter specifically&#13;
                          refers to family access to adequate basic sanitation and rubbish disposal systems.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     42&#13;
&amp;#12;    Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
    1. Sanitation in water catchment areas is prioritised because contamination from municipal waste water&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                      Colombia&#13;
         requires high levels of investment.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Institutional strengthening of the territorial authorities is fundamental in fulfilling the targets set by&#13;
         National Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;

&#13;
3.1 Disposal of excreta, treatment of domestic waste water and solid waste&#13;
The body operating as a rector on policy at a national level is the Ministry of the Environment, Housing and&#13;
Territorial Development (MAVDT), through the recently created Viceministry of Water and Sanitation (VAS). The&#13;
regulation of these services is the responsibility of the Commission for the Regulation of Drinking Water and&#13;
Basic Sanitation (CRA) and inspection, control and monitoring fall to the Superintendence of Public Domestic&#13;
Services (SSPD) which is also responsible for issuing the accountancy standards that must be applied to those&#13;
supplying public domestic services. Since 1994, public domestic services of sewerage and sanitation have&#13;
been a municipal responsibility and must be provided by companies of an official, private or mixed nature and,&#13;
in exceptional circumstances, by the municipal authorities themselves.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
              1. Process of ending the use of open tips, landfill and disposal in bodies of water has not been&#13;
                 completed.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Support is required for territorial entities in implementation of the plans for Integrated Management&#13;
                 of Solid Waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           3.2 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
           VAS runs the Hand-washing Programme, the objective of which is to implement a campaign in Colombia&#13;
           to promote hand-washing with soap at critical times during the day. The aim is to reduce the incidence of&#13;
           diarrhoea in children under five-years-old - especially in the lower income sectors of the population â&#128;&#147; and to&#13;
           establish the hand-washing habit amongst the general public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
              1. Adoption of the hand-washing practice requires a strong awareness raising strategy, in order to&#13;
                 establish the habit and make it memorable.&#13;
&#13;
              2. There are insufficient resources to achieve hand-washing practice objectives in the medium and long&#13;
                 term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Policies have been established on subsidies, recovery of cost and tariffs for the disposal of excreta and the&#13;
           treatment of waste water and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
           The country has a large deficit of resources with which to meet the levels of subsidy set by law. In order&#13;
           to resolve this situation, National Government issued a methodology that allows for a balance to be found&#13;
           between contributions and subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
     44&#13;
&amp;#12;In terms of financial monitoring mechanisms: regulatory commissions have defined the obligatory criteria,&#13;
methodologies, indicators, parameters and models for evaluation of the management and performance of                            Colombia&#13;
service providers. The CRA establishes methodologies for vetting providers of aqueducts, sewerage and&#13;
sanitation, according to their risk level, calculating the relevant financial indicators and quality operating&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    Estimated investments for&#13;

     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. Greater follow-up is needed in the execution of resources in order to ensure that works benefit people&#13;
          in lower income brackets.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Evaluation of the level of financial risk of service providers requires that reports of the information&#13;
          necessary to SSPD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
SSPD is responsible for establishing, administering, maintaining and operating an information system for&#13;
domestic public services in the country. The Single Information System (SUI) has been created for this purpose,&#13;
and public domestic service providers must all provide information related to commercial issues, technical&#13;
cooperation, administration and finances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
&#13;
National Government has monitoring systems to assess progress toward the targets established. A target has&#13;
been set relating to the number of people newly gaining benefit from the sewerage service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
     1. SSPD is not yet receiving regular reports of the required information, and therefore does not have&#13;
          a solid basis on which to issue regulations and policies, nor to establish control, monitoring and&#13;
          planning mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Low institutional capacity amongst service providers serving only a small number of users hampers&#13;
          the reporting of information in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                45&#13;
&amp;#12;           6. Capacities&#13;
Colombia&#13;
           National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
           There is a National Plan for Training and Technical Assistance, a group of policies, programmes, strategies,&#13;
           instruments and institutions that guide training, technical assistance and the acquisition of work competence,&#13;
           aimed at workers linked to public entities, private enterprise&#13;
           and mixed domestic public water, sewerage and sanitation&#13;
                                                                             Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
           service providers, in order to improve the quality of these&#13;
           services in urban and rural areas.                                1. The MDGs must be disseminated and&#13;
                                                                                adopted by society throughout all&#13;
           Similarly, ACODAL and ANDESCO offer their members&#13;
                                                                                territorial entities.&#13;
           training programmes in various areas relating to water,&#13;
                                                                             2. More alternatives are needed for the&#13;
           sewerage and sanitation service provision.&#13;
                                                                                management and treatment of waste&#13;
           MAVDT offers technical assistance and training in water              waters and by-products.&#13;
           and sanitation through various programmes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
           Waste water treatment systems exist at the site of origin; there are centralised systems and undersea emitters.&#13;
           As for the disposal of solid waste, current regulations state obligatory use of sanitary landfill as a reference&#13;
           technology in the management of this waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
           1. Policies and strategies&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Consolidate the formulation and implementation of Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans in all the&#13;
                 departments and municipal areas of the country in order to improve the coverage and quality of drainage&#13;
                 and sewerage services.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Make progress on programmes that link water and sanitation policy with environmental and housing&#13;
                 policies. Environmental authorities must implement quality objectives that are achievable by those&#13;
                 operating under the regulations, while service providers must formulate sanitation and waste management&#13;
                 plans as a planning tool.&#13;
&#13;
           2. Legal Framework&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Promote unification of sector regulations in order to improve the training process and technical assistance&#13;
                 to various stakeholders.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Integration of regulatory tools in order for them to be consistent with planning instruments.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Standards issued by National Government must be disseminated to all related stakeholders; mayors,&#13;
                 governors, public service providers and the community in general, in order to guarantee that they are&#13;
                 applied correctly.&#13;
&#13;
           3. Institutional framework&#13;
             	3.1 Waste water treatment&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Advances must be made in works required to resolve the issue of water contamination as a result of&#13;
                 municipal dumping in priority water catchment areas.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Integration of the various planning instruments implemented by the diverse bodies of National&#13;
                 Government (the sanitation and tipping plan (PSMV), waste water management plan (PMAR), regional&#13;
                 environmental management plan (PGAR), and the watershed organisation plan (POMCA)).&#13;
     46&#13;
&amp;#12;  3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthen the sewerage sector, through training and the generation of a business culture.                    Colombia&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop the regionalisation processes in the service, especially in the final disposal of solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The long-term commitment of resources is required from territorial entities in order to guarantee set&#13;
       targets are met.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The nation must provide the support needed in those cases where credit is required from multilateral&#13;
       banks.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 There must be greater awareness is needed of the need to move forward on investments in wastewater&#13;
       treatment plants, where these are the priority. This requires that all stakeholders contribute to the&#13;
       organisation of sources of funding.&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Reduce dispersed allocation of resources for the drinking water and basic sanitation sector in order to&#13;
       ensure greater monitoring of these.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Design tools that allow for the efficiency of defined policy strategies to be monitored.&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Optimise operations in the waste water treatment systems already built.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthen the formulation and implementation of the PSMV.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop alternative forms of waste water and by-product management and treatment.&#13;
&#13;

Successful experience: Private participation in sanitation&#13;
&#13;
MAVDT has supported links with specialist operators as service providers, and indicators on coverage and&#13;
quality in cities that did not previously have a sewerage system have improved. In the four years from 2002 to&#13;
2006, 22 contracts were signed with specialist operators.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The targets will be fulfilled, if we take into consideration the indicator of access to improved sanitation (techno-&#13;
    logies for excreta and wastewater management), defined in the JMP. This indicator refers to neither the quality&#13;
    nor sustainability of the service.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In the National Development Plan 2006-2010, Central Government aims to achieve an advance of more than&#13;
    50% in sanitation targets through an environmental improvement project in the metropolitan area of San JosÃ©,&#13;
    the â&#128;&#152;Ciudades Limpiasâ&#128;&#153; (clean cities) programme and the installation of collection centres for the reuse or re-&#13;
    cycling of solid waste in 22 cantons.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Health Ministry aims to advance from treating illness to a health promotion as a social value.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of the Environment and Energy has defined five working priorities, including the integrated mana-&#13;
    gement of water resources and environmental quality management (covering the prevention and monitoring of&#13;
    contamination).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation is not identified as a national political issue.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There is no clear and effective monitoring of regulations/legislation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are no integrated regulations for septic tanks - the most widely used technology in the country. No&#13;
    actions have been defined for the management, treatment and disposal of sewage sludge, as in most cases&#13;
    these are removed by operators with no clear idea of treatment and disposal norms.&#13;

&amp;#12;             â&#128;¢	 Current legislation does not deal clearly with the treatment and final disposal of sludge from waste water&#13;
Costa Rica     treatment systems.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 The regulations and institutions themselves limit technological innovation to alternative drainage and&#13;
               treatment systems. This obstructs solutions in marginal settlements or areas with special geographical or&#13;
               geological conditions.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Public service companies and municipal authorities have access to neither sources of funding at&#13;
               advantageous rates or state subsidies. Sanitation tariffs must use methodologies that allow for automatic&#13;
               updating. Drainage systems are partly charged for at present, but treatment is not.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Coastal areas and the developing tourism sector demand special products and extraordinary investments,&#13;
               as do most urban centres.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Projects currently underway in coastal urban centres have not taken into account the effects of climatic&#13;
               variability and climate change.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Most municipal authorities lack plans for regulation and where these do exist, they are out of date.&#13;
               There are no local master plans to provide figures and correct technical details for future connections&#13;
               and to prevent clandestine connections.&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 There are illicit connections and rainwater connections to the sewerage system, which reduces the&#13;
               sustainability of the system - a situation that is aggravated by limitations in urban rain water drainage&#13;
               management.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 Collections of solid waste are of a low quality, with municipal authorities proving deficient in technical,     Costa Rica&#13;
  administrative and financial capacity. There is large-scale dumping of waste in river beds. The private sector&#13;
  must be encouraged to participate in management.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are no control or technical monitoring mechanisms for the private management of sanitary landfills&#13;
  or tips.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There is no national body for the municipal sector to consult on techniques, regulations, etc.&#13;

Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Development Plan 2006-2010 proposes projects like sewerage systems for the metropolitan&#13;
  area of San JosÃ© and similar projects in Heredia, Alajuela, LimÃ³n and Cartago. The Costa Rican Institute of&#13;
  Aqueducts and Sewerage (AyA) under the Rural Aqueducts Division (DAR) direction and the German KfW&#13;
  Bank programme, incorporates the sanitation variable into new projects, and these will be used as a basis&#13;
  for policies in this sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Solid waste has been discussed more than liquid waste nationally, due to the sanitation problems generated&#13;
  as a consequence of poor collection and final disposal.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Urban Development Plan for the large central metropolitan area covers the environmental issue&#13;
  and network infrastructure of as two of its main considerations.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sector policies and strategies are in place on hygiene promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of&#13;
  excreta, the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and the treatment&#13;
  of waste water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   1. Institutional plans of action do not contain the correct information, training or strategic values for the&#13;
      issue. There is a lack of understanding of the problem and the responsibilities that should be fulfilled&#13;
      by decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Inconsistency in the formulation of targets amongst municipal authorities and local entities in relation&#13;
      to current environmental regulations and other norms. Deficient monitoring and control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

               Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
               1. Enactment of laws and regulations takes a lot of time, whereby the updating of control, sanction and&#13;
                  incentive mechanisms is very slow. There is duplication (overlap) of competencies and a lack of inter-&#13;
                  institutional coordination.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Legal framework does not provide resources in order for its stipulations to be fulfilled. The existence&#13;
                  of laws on paper does not guarantee they will be fulfilled.&#13;

3.1	 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The division of functions is adequate. However, there are deficiencies in some municipal authorities, mainly due&#13;
to a lack of human, technical and financial resources. Sewage sludge is removed by private companies when&#13;
requested by clients.&#13;

There are no formally established coordination platforms.&#13;
The â&#128;&#152;tankersâ&#128;&#153; or companies that remove sewage sludge                      1. Lack of coordination, diffuse functions at inter-&#13;
&#13;
privately, have their own organisation. The Commission for                   and intra-institutional levels. Lack of planning&#13;
&#13;
the Regulation of the Dumping and Reuse of Waste Water                       between institutions in keeping with a national&#13;
&#13;
is the most formal body in existence, with representatives                   framework on sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
from most of the interested sectors. Its functions include:               2. The absence of an integrated national policy on&#13;
review of the regulations and improvements in these, but                     sanitation leads to a lack of common objectives&#13;
not application of the regulations themselves.                               amongst the institutions.&#13;

&#13;
3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of&#13;
     solid waste&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Even where there is a division of functions being fulfilled, some municipal authorities have signed contracts&#13;
   with private companies for the collection, transportation and final disposal of waste.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Municipal authorities have organised themselves into federations or leagues of municipalities, grouped by&#13;
   province or region. In some cases, shared tips or landfills have been proposed for use by several municipal&#13;
   authorities.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are networks of private service providers to collect and sort recyclable materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
   1. Policies on correct regional and local management are not very clear. There are no appropriate&#13;
       mechanisms for monitoring and control.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Municipal authorities and the State have no programmes to promote rational management of solid&#13;
       waste (reduction, reuse, etc.). These services with high levels of arrears.&#13;

In terms of waste water treatment, the plan is to establish a levy on dumps, where part of the money raised&#13;
will be used for specific action on this issue. Some municipal authorities and institutions providing the service&#13;
will charge subsidised rates. Municipal authorities will set tariffs for the collection, treatment and sanitary dis-&#13;
posal of solid waste. Collection costs are generally subsidised as the municipal authorities themselves carry&#13;
out the work. The treatment and disposal (that is becoming a more widespread practice) is contracted out to&#13;
companies, who set their tariffs according to costs and profits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A financial monitoring mechanism is in place as the institutions managing sewerage systems, waste water&#13;
treatment and solid waste facilities, presenting financial and economic reports to State economic regulators&#13;
when adjusting their tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
       1. There is no appropriate integrated scheme defined for funding.&#13;
&#13;
       2. Tariff adjustments for solid waste are not brought in line with real costs fast enough in most&#13;
            municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 There is no national and centralised information system for the sector. However, there are some small&#13;
       opportunities for data collection in the universities. The National Development Plan 2006-2010 includes a&#13;
       plan for a National System for Environmental Information that will include a component of environmental&#13;
       indicators, some of which will be related to sanitation. This initiative is coordinated by MINAE in order to&#13;
       guarantee sustainability in these indicators.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 The National Institute for Statistics and Censuses (INEC) carries out surveys and national censuses that&#13;
       provide direct information on citizens (connection to sanitation, drainage, connection to a septic tank,&#13;
       use of latrine, defecation in the open, access to sanitation services, access to a bathroom, number of&#13;
       bathrooms, removal of rubbish, availability of basic services).&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 The social security system, now organised in integrated basic health care teams (EBAIS), collects data from&#13;
       communities (access to sanitation services, within or outside the home, how far distant), covering sanitation&#13;
       issues. But this data is often only processed for annual reports by the institution. A similar situation occurs&#13;
       with the information collected by municipal authorities and companies in relation to solid waste.                                                                                 55&#13;
&amp;#12;Costa Rica   Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
             As part of the National Development Plan, the issue is included in social sector strategies, where institutions&#13;
             like the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Housing are involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
               1. Legal norms do not consider the content, procedures, or strategies involved in training staff and&#13;
                   acquiring necessary equipment for correct monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Information collected is not analysed in an appropriate manner, nor has it been used to design&#13;
                   plans and programmes that aim to improve sanitation conditions. The information is not shared or&#13;
                   exchanged between institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Several institutions like the AyA have proposed exchanges through agreements with national educational&#13;
             institutions, at both technical and university level. They will design staff training programmes in systems directly&#13;
             administered by them, by community aqueduct associations (ASADAS) and the municipal authorities. Similarly,&#13;
             IFAM has promoted agreements so that the universities and the National Institute of Learning (INA) can also&#13;
             contribute to administrative and technical issues that will improve municipal operational capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             The country has enough adequately trained&#13;
             human resources to identify the technologies            Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
             needed to resolve national problems. However,&#13;
                                                                     1. There is a lack of inter-agency work on the&#13;
             current regulations, the lack of sanitation&#13;
                                                                        provision of correct support and exchange.&#13;
             education at all levels and the attitude of officials&#13;
                                                                     2. There is no integrated national policy on sanitation,&#13;
             frequently hampers the use of alternative&#13;
                                                                        meaning that the appropriate adjustments are not&#13;
             technologies applicable to very specific cases.&#13;
                                                                        made. National capacity is not fully exploited.&#13;
             Some technologies have been appropriately&#13;
             applied in various areas of the country.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
             Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             1. Policies and strategies&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Produce an integrated national policy to deal correctly with sanitation in interaction with other national&#13;
                    programmes on the basis of regional planning for water catchment areas amongst others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             2. Legal Framework&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Encourage training amongst decision-makers and middle management in order that they may recognize&#13;
                    and approach the sanitation issue correctly.&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Encourage the productive sector and respective organisations to help improve legislation and regulations&#13;
                    in order to achieve a healthy environment where health is protected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             3. Institutional framework&#13;
                3.1	Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
                     domestic waste water&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Outline a national policy on sanitation providing regulations to evaluate the impact of the techniques&#13;
                    used in order to achieve national, regional and local indicators that measure and promote advances&#13;
      56            made toward fulfilling targets.&#13;
&amp;#12;	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Define an integrated national policy on sanitation to guide local actions that provide measurable               Costa Rica&#13;
       outcomes and contribute to fulfilment of the indicators.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Encourage users to become involved responsibly and communities to be vigilant on proposals and&#13;
       processes executed in their municipal areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Seek user support through public consultation on investments in view of the financial impacts of pro-&#13;
       jects on tariff adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Define the sanitation objective on a national level to allow institutions and organisations involved to work&#13;
       jointly on the monitoring and evaluation of quality indicators in order to execute corrective actions - like&#13;
       the verification of improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Outline training programmes at all levels, for officials â&#128;&#147; mainly in middle management.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2007, nearly 98% of the population of the Dominican Republic had access to adequate disposal of excreta,&#13;
    although only 20% had access to sewerage systems. The MDGs indicate that by 2015 there will be 100%&#13;
    coverage for the first indicator, while the second will stand at just over 30%.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 From the information available it can be surmised that 35% of the urban population has waste water treatment&#13;
    service coverage. The MDG here is 67.5%&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 High levels of investment are required in order to meet the MDGs, and this will be spent on construction of the&#13;
    new infrastructure and the operation and maintenance of existing sanitation services. Some US$ 51.2 is needed&#13;
    for building latrines; US$ 305 million for sewerage in the urban sector; and US$ 494.4 million for the treatment&#13;
    of urban waste waters. The schemes will benefit nearly three million inhabitants and 4,114 l/s of water will be&#13;
    obtained as an outcome of these investments.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 PAHO figures put national coverage for the collection of solid waste at 69.4% and final disposal at 39%. The&#13;
    country does not have goals on the solid waste issue within the framework of the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 All recent analysis (2006) has stated that the fundamental causes of the problems with drinking water and&#13;
    sanitation services do not lie in a lack of funding, but rather in the way the investments are made, given the&#13;
    absence of a suitable institutional framework to promote the implementation of effective policies and strategies.&#13;
    Updates of the situation a year ago do not show any change in the sector - a tendency that suggests only the&#13;
    goals set for the adequate disposal of excreta will be met in urban areas nationally.&#13;

              17.8% of the annual average deemed necessary in order to achieve the MDGs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
            Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Inadequate mechanisms for executing investment in the sector&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Absence of sector planning and, therefore, of master plans for national piped water and sewerage systems.&#13;
              Both issues suffer from the common problem of a general absence of public sector policies, specifically&#13;
              those aimed at reducing gaps.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Indicators for service quality are even more worrying than those for coverage, revealing yet another&#13;
              important gap.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 The amount of investment being made in the Dominican Republic exceeds that of most countries for&#13;
              fulfilment of the MDGs, except in countries where service coverage is far lower than the national goals.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 The methodology used to establish the MDGs in water and sanitation in the country led to the adoption&#13;
              of a useful instrument for change in the water and sanitation sector, which contributes to reducing&#13;
              existing gaps.&#13;

Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
Even though there are policies and strategies on many aspects of sanitation and modern legal frameworks are in&#13;
place, the way the national budget is executed shows that sanitation is actually given very little priority.&#13;
&#13;
Policies and strategies are in place for: hygiene&#13;
promotion and sanitation education; the disposal&#13;
of excreta; the treatment of waste waters; and              Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of          1. There are no mechanisms in place to encourage in-&#13;
solid waste. However, there are none established                vestment in sanitation by service providers.&#13;
for the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal         2. There is no national entity responsible for planning in&#13;
of sewage sludge. Similarly, no links exist between             the water and sanitation sector.&#13;
these policies and the poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
There is a legal framework on: hygiene promotion and sanitation education; disposal of excreta; waste water&#13;
treatment; the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste; monitoring of contamination in water&#13;
courses; and reuse of municipal waste water and solid waste. However, regulations on the collection, treatment&#13;
and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and the reuse of human excreta and sewage sludge still need to be&#13;
developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
   1. The existing legal framework for the drinking water and sanitation sector is obsolete and diffuse&#13;
      with large gaps.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Although the environmental legal framework is quite complex and up to date, the mechanisms to&#13;
      guarantee implementation are very weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
     domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
In the drinking water and sanitation sector, there is no division of functions. Service providers fulfil all the&#13;
functions within their respective areas of jurisdiction. As a result, there are no platforms for coordination between&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                         61&#13;

                Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
 Republic&#13;
                1. Lack of definition of roles and weakness of institutions in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
                2. Overlapping roles within the institutions themselves due to the lack of institutional organisation.&#13;

Policies have not been developed on subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for the disposal of excreta; the&#13;
collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; the treatment of waste waters;&#13;
hygiene promotion and sanitation education. There are also no mechanisms for financial monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. There is no specific funding for sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
     2. The absolute freedom of service providers in the planning and use of resources in the drinking water&#13;
         and sanitation sector has meant that more than 95% of resources are used for drinking water services&#13;
         to the detriment of sanitation initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The main indicators for the sector are: adequate disposal of excreta; sewerage coverage; and the percentage&#13;
    of waste water collected and receiving treatment. There are no information systems in operation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation issues and actions are included in: major surveys; and projects and studies to analyse health&#13;
    improvements, the mitigation of environmental pollution and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
     1. Absence of a sector information system.&#13;
&#13;
     2. National indicators only include information on infrastructure. The National Census of 1981 barely&#13;
         incorporates sewerage coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 63&#13;
&amp;#12;            6. Capacities&#13;
Dominican&#13;
 Republic   There has been no national consideration of the shortfall in the number of existing sanitation staff (governmental&#13;
            institutions, universities, training and research centres, the private sector) compared with number of&#13;
            appropriately trained staff needed to achieve the MDGs in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
            However, there has been, and still it is, a deeply rooted national culture in the use of appropriate water and&#13;
            sanitation technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
              1. Very high level of turnover in qualified staff due to political patronage.&#13;
&#13;
              2. A multiplicity of stakeholders in each function: governance, regulation and service provision.&#13;
&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Requirements for coverage in the country are high if national sanitation targets are to be met. Waste water and&#13;
    excreta disposal services must increase by 29% nationally; wastewater treatment by 6%; the collection of solid&#13;
    waste by 22%; and the sanitary disposal of solid waste by 23%. Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
    must be incorporated as a key dimension with a more integrated outlook on work in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2002 the National Policy on Water and Sanitation was formulated. This was accompanied by the Sector&#13;
    Development Plan that containe short-, medium- and long-term goals and sector reforms to comply with the&#13;
    MDGs. However, these have not been implemented. Isolated and diffuse efforts have been made, but there has&#13;
    been no high-level political decision to fulfil MDG commitments. The new government that took office in January&#13;
    2007 proposed a national objective of significantly increased coverage for basic services, incorporating national&#13;
    targets higher than those of the MDGs, providing funding and designing the National Social, Productive and&#13;
    Environmental Development Plan 2007-2010.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The few programmes encouraging co-participation have made important contributions to the design and&#13;
    implementation of new management models in small municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The inter-agency water and sanitation committee CIASE has become stronger, has held meetings and provided&#13;
    support for the implementation of sector policy and national plans for water and sanitation and solid waste in&#13;
    collaboration with the governing body.&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Historically, sanitation has been considered of secondary importance in Ecuador. Government intervention&#13;
  by past regimes concentrated exclusively on improved drinking water coverage, widening the gap between&#13;
  drinking water and sewerage services. Over&#13;
  the last year, the new central government and&#13;
  local governments have given greater priority          Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
  to the issue. In the larger cities, strategies are&#13;

  plans that will allow this gap to be closed in&#13;
                                                             perspective has not been established.&#13;

                                                         2. General policies and strategies exist for the sector,&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are sector policies and strategies for              but important issues like sewage sludge and solid&#13;
  hygiene promotion and sanitation education;                waste need to be addressed.&#13;
  the disposal of excreta; and the treatment of&#13;
  waste water, while those for the collection,&#13;
  treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage&#13;
  sludge and solid waste are still in the development process.&#13;

There are no clear and explicit links between sector policies and the national strategy for poverty reduction,&#13;
environmental protection and economic development.&#13;

                Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
                1. Various public sector entities are involved in water and sanitation, implementing contradictory&#13;
                   policies and perspectives.&#13;
&#13;
                2. There is institutional chaos with no definition of limits of the responsibilities of one institution in&#13;
                   relation to another.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
&#13;
             There is no division of functions. Governance activities are executed by MIDUVI, MAE and MSP. Municipal&#13;
             authorities are responsible for service provision, but they also exercise regulatory functions within their&#13;
             territory.&#13;

3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
The Ministry of Health has implemented a programme on alternative methods of domestic water disinfection&#13;
through Environmental Education - public health staff in rural areas are trained to produce chlorine and rural&#13;
communities are shown how to use this to disinfect water appropriately. MIDUVI runs a water disinfection&#13;
programme in rural communities following the SODIS solar water disinfection methodology. Meanwhile, the&#13;
Ministry of Education is running a health promotion programme in 700 schools with outreach to the surrounding&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
    1. Programmes do not follow long-term policies, and there are insufficient human, technical and&#13;
        financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Issue is not given sufficient importance and is still not seen as an integral part of interventions in the&#13;
        sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

          of waste water. Such policies are not planned for&#13;
                                                                           attribution for the sector within the State.&#13;

&#13;
          There is no national mechanism for financial                     have often been disbursed for the same&#13;

&#13;
          programme creates its own mechanisms.                            access to the service.&#13;

&#13;
          5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
          Percentage of service coverage is the most commonly used national indicator but the various institutions&#13;
          define coverage in different ways.&#13;
&#13;
          The current government is implementing a national water, sanitation and solid waste census in urban areas.&#13;
          The same procedure will then be followed in rural areas in order to compile a baseline for the planning,&#13;
          monitoring, evaluation and adjustment of public policies and national strategies on the subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
              1. There is currently no system for information, monitoring and evaluation of the subsector, nor is there&#13;
                an integrated strategy to provide coherent relationships between variables such as investment,&#13;
                coverage, quality, efficiency of management, etc.&#13;
&#13;
              2. The lack of monitoring and evaluation blocks opportunities for learning that could lead to prompt&#13;
                correction and better guidance on intervention strategies.&#13;

&#13;
          National reflection on staff to achieve the MDGs/&#13;
          national targets&#13;
&#13;
          Both governing entities and institutions in the sector             Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
          agree there is a deficit of trained and competent staff.           1. Local governments, especially in&#13;
          There is clear awareness of the urgent need for national              small municipal authorities, are given&#13;
          investment in strengthening water and sanitation                      responsibility for service provision, but&#13;
          capacity at various levels (local, national, urban and                do not have the technical or management&#13;
          rural) across all players (governance, service providers,             capacity needed to offer a quality service.&#13;
          regulators). It is important for universities to incorporate&#13;
                                                                             2. Universities are not offering academic&#13;
          the sector demands and adjust technological and&#13;
                                                                                provision tailored to the demands for&#13;
          engineering training provision, as well as providing&#13;
                                                                                training and specialisation in the sector.&#13;
          postgraduate and specialist qualifications. Municipal&#13;
          authorities and administrative councils have a proven&#13;
          need for capacity strengthening as they are the main&#13;
          bodies responsible for service provision. Work is currently underway on the design of a National Plan for&#13;
          Strengthening Capacities in the Sector.&#13;

&amp;#12;Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
                                                                                                                      Ecuador&#13;
No technological research is being undertaken into alternative sanitation solutions in the country. There has been&#13;
insufficient political will, resource allocation and determination to test and adapt alternative technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Revise the 2002 national water and sanitation policy in order to update this in a participatory manner&#13;
      under the leadership and coordination of National Government through the national planning department&#13;
      (SENPLADES), MIDUVI and the national water resource council (CNRH). Incorporate a multisector and&#13;
      decentralised perspective.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Complete an analysis - national inventory of the water and sanitation situation in order to implement a&#13;
      system to monitor and evaluate fulfilment of the public policy cycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Build a coherent and legal framework integrated with existing legislation, containing definitions of&#13;
      institutional roles, and approve the Law for the provision of water and sanitation services.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Create and disseminate regulations on waste water, sewage sludge, the treatment of excreta and&#13;
      sanitation in general.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
      domestic waste water&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthen the institutional framework for water and sanitation in the national forum, section governments&#13;
      and the JAAPs. Achieve a clear definition of institutional roles.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Promote the creation of a national water system (including water and sanitation), with an integrated&#13;
      management outlook for water catchment areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Provide clear definitions of institutional roles and their fulfilment at various levels (national and local).&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Promote the perspective of integrated solid waste management in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Make the requirements for State loans and resources more flexible, according to the size and nature of&#13;
      the investment project. Promote management indices as qualifying elements in the award or retention&#13;
      of non-repayable funds.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Promote single funding policies that include NGOs, State Banks in accordance with poverty/social&#13;
      inequality maps, considering the importance of counterpart contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Design, training for and implementation of SIPME with a unit established within the governing body.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Generate and institutionalise citizen participation mechanisms and social monitoring of water and&#13;
      sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      73&#13;
&amp;#12;          6. Capacities&#13;
Ecuador&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Creation of a National System for Strengthening Capacity in the Sector that considers current efforts (the&#13;
                  CAMAREN training system developed by Ecuadorâ&#128;&#153;s cocoa sector stakeholders, universities, etc.) and&#13;
                  business models for service provision in Municipal authorities and JAAPs. Link the issue of capacities to&#13;
                  that of funding.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Design and implementation of a National Plan for Information and Training in Hygiene and Sanitation&#13;
                  Education, focusing on issues like water quality, rational use of the resource, the preservation of water&#13;
                  sources, etc.&#13;
&#13;

          Successful experience: Incentive for practical improvements in the integrated management of&#13;
          solid waste: The experience on the southern frontier of Ecuador.&#13;
          Since the peace agreement between the governments of Ecuador and Peru in October 1998, the province&#13;
          of Loja has seen dynamic development in many aspects, one of which is the Integrated Management of&#13;
          Solid Waste (GIRS), achieving large improvements on the basis of co-ordinated and synergies with various&#13;
          institutions including USAID, CARE, Plan International, municipal authorities, provincial councils and the&#13;
          local people themselves. At present, all of the cantons of Loja manage their solid waste in an integrated&#13;
          manner, considering socio-cultural, politico-legal, organisational, economic and financial, environmental&#13;
          and technological aspects. This process has been strengthened in the last three years by an interesting&#13;
          mechanism: the Fondo Concursable (an award fund) provided by the Provincial Government of Loja which&#13;
          aims to guarantee the sustainability of the GIRS in the province, recognizing and rewarding that the best&#13;
          practices of municipal authorities each year. As an outcome of the process, coverage has been improved by&#13;
          7% and an initiative has been created that can be visited and replicated by other national and international&#13;
          actors.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Access to sanitation services stood at 74.7% of the population in 2006. There are considerable inequalities in&#13;
     access to sanitation between the rural population and urban populations. In the urban areas 91% of people have&#13;
     access to latrines and 69% in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2006, systems administered by the National Aqueduct and Sewerage Administration (ANDA), decentralised&#13;
     operators and former rural water and sanitation plan PLANSABAR provided 91% coverage in urban areas and&#13;
     58% in rural zones.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are 262 municipal areas in El Salvador, of which, 168 were administered by ANDA and 89 by municipal&#13;
     mayoral offices, water boards, mixed ventures, etc. Less than half of those administered by ANDA â&#128;&#147; 81 - have&#13;
     sewerage systems, and only eight of these include a waste water treatment plant for domestic waste water.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 UNDP guidelines state that even where MDGs have already been achieved in merely quantitative terms, rigorous&#13;
     evaluation of the use of latrines and the disposal of excreta of a population would probably show qualitative&#13;
     deficiencies in fulfilment. The situation of the quality of waste water presents an alarming situation, as most of&#13;
     this is tipped into rivers with practically no treatment at all.&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Disorganised population growth.&#13;

              Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 There is no adequate policy as more attention is given to resource use and distribution than resource&#13;
                             conservation. While it is important for the entire population to have access to basic services, the coverage&#13;
                             offered must be of a good quality and resource sustainability must also be taken into consideration.&#13;
                             Therefore, the end users of drinking water supplies must be guaranteed a continuous service providing&#13;
                             water acceptable for human consumption, meaning that policies must incorporate investment for ongoing&#13;
                             monitoring and the impact on climate change.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 El Salvador is urgently in need of a general national plan on access to and the appropriate use of water&#13;
   resources and the country also requires a water reuse strategy.                                                  El Salvador&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation in rural areas is largely managed through the construction of latrines, while urban areas generally&#13;
   have flushing toilets with sewerage. As a result, rural homes are more vulnerable to the contamination of&#13;
   water sources where sanitation is inadequate.&#13;

are in place on: hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
education; the disposal of excreta, the collection,          2. Weak political will to fulfil existing&#13;

                               Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
                               1. Diffuse regulations on the sanitation sector, allowing for existence of institutional vacuums and a&#13;
                                   lack of clarity on roles and competences&#13;
&#13;
                               2. Weak political will to fulfil existing legislation added to financial limitations on investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          3. Institutional framework&#13;

                          3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          At present, there are no definitions of the extent of governance, regulation and service provision. These&#13;
                          functions are exercised by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Environment, National Administration of&#13;
                          Aqueducts and Drainage Systems and municipal mayorsâ&#128;&#153; offices, even when they have not been adequately&#13;
                          fulfilled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          It is important to point out that a Bill on the drinking water and sanitation subsector has been presented to the&#13;

Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
A hand-washing and hygiene initiative is currently underway, providing promotion and education in areas selected&#13;
because of their high epidemiological risk levels. This will help reduce the incidence and prevalence of disease&#13;
associated to inadequate hand-washing and hygiene in children less than 10-years-old. These programmes&#13;
include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 FOCARD-APS, RASES, MSPAS, ANDA. The impact of this programme is particularly directed at children&#13;
   under 10 years old in areas of high epidemiological risk, to improve their health conditions through the promotion&#13;
   of improved hand-washing and hygiene practices and education on the issue.&#13;

              and sanitation education; the disposal of excreta; the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage sludge;&#13;
              and the treatment of waste water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              It is important to indicate that the ANDA tariff currently does not include          Critical aspects of&#13;
              an element for collection, transportation and treatment, and the same is             sanitation funding&#13;
              true of water administration association charges. Municipal authorities&#13;
                                                                                                   1. Lack of awareness of the&#13;
              do not include a charge for sanitation either. Some rural drinking water&#13;
                                                                                                      economic value of water.&#13;
              councils have funding programmes to cover infrastructure costs for&#13;
                                                                                                   2. There are no tariffs for&#13;
              the disposal of excreta and the treatment of grey waters. However,&#13;
                                                                                                      sanitation.&#13;
              communities do not tend to prioritise investment in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Monitoring mechanisms exist through external and internal auditors.&#13;

&amp;#12;5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
                                                                                                                 El Salvador&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
Coverage is the only national indicator used for sanitation. There is no processed information on the sector&#13;
and the data that does exist on a national level is not updated yearly.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
Sanitation is linked to improvements in health. The sustainable management of water resources in all areas&#13;
and for all uses is related to the reduction of poverty and environmental contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
   1. Lack of clarity in basic concepts: each institution defines how, when, where and what should be&#13;
      measured.&#13;
&#13;
   2. There is no uniformity of criteria to evaluate indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National reflection on staff to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
There is a paucity of staff. The Universities spend their time on data collection and not on researching&#13;
appropriate technologies for the country. Educational programmes must be modernised and updated.&#13;
&#13;
Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
The necessary technology is available on the national and international markets, but this has not been&#13;
adequately promoted and funding is not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
   1. Lack of clarity in making the MDGs known on a national level.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Lack of support for research and replication of successful ventures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies and legal framework&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Despite some advances made in the matter of legal frameworks, the country still needs a General&#13;
     Water Law and subsidiary laws for the drinking water and sanitation subsector.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 There is an urgent need to close legal gaps and eliminate overlaps of institutional competence as&#13;
     indicated in the Environment Law. The responsibility for this falls upon the Technical Secretariat of the&#13;
     Presidency, the legislative assembly and MARN.&#13;
&#13;
2. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
  2.1	 Hygiene promotion, excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
       domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 A permanent national plan is needed on education, awareness raising and access to information on&#13;
     sanitation and cleaner production. The responsibility for this falls upon the government institutions&#13;
     responsible, municipal authorities, the academic sector, the private sector and civil society.&#13;
                                                                                                                  83&#13;
&amp;#12;                2.2 Solid waste management&#13;
El Salvador      â&#128;¢	 Increased political will is needed to improve inter-agency coordination in order to make sanitation a priority&#13;
                    within the government plan. The responsibility here lies with Technical Secretariat of the Presidency and&#13;
                    the legislative assembly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              3. Funding&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Establish tariffs that reflect the real cost of the service of transportation, collection and treatment of waste&#13;
                    waters including subsidies for the poorest sectors. Raise awareness on the economic value of water and&#13;
                    sanitation. The responsibility for this lies with the legislative assembly, sewerage system operators and&#13;
                    consumers in the residential, industrial and commercial sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              4. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Strengthening of the regulatory and monitoring functions of MARN.&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Provide MARN with a greater resources in terms of finances, technical provision, staff and institutional&#13;
                    management. Responsibility for this falls upon the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency, the Ministry&#13;
                    of the Interior and MARN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              5. Capacities&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Creation of an academic policy to form the basis for professionals trained in sanitation related issues,&#13;
                    whilst also encouraging research at the University and at the professional level. Responsibility for this&#13;
                    falls upon the Ministry of Education and MARN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
              Successful experience: Treatment of waste waters in La Villa de Apaneca&#13;
&#13;
              The city of Apaneca, department of Ahuachapan, is a tourist development centre in the region. However, the&#13;
              city was unhealthy due largely to the absence of a sewage system, the discharging of grey water into the&#13;
              open, and contamination where raw waste water was discharged to a seasonal riverbed.&#13;
&#13;
              In 2001, ANDA decided to improve sanitation conditions for the resident population of an estimated 5,500&#13;
              inhabitants, through a project to introduce a sewage system and construct a waste water treatment plant for&#13;
              La Villa de Apaneca. Approval of the environmental permit included a public debate due to opposition raised&#13;
              against the project by residents and mountain municipalities down river from the town. A year on, a favourable&#13;
              outcome was achieved in the first environmental hearing ever held by the Ministry of the Environment.&#13;
&#13;
              At present the control and monitoring mechanisms in the project include: local technical operator training;&#13;
              registers of samples taken from the various stages of the process: appraisals; cleaning; operation and main-&#13;
              tenance, etc., in accordance with current environmental regulations.&#13;
&#13;
              The desired objective was finally achieved once the plant opened and was seen to function and through the&#13;
              coordination of municipal authorities and campaigns: the population of La Villa de Apaneca was improvements&#13;
              in health conditions; no damage was done to the environment; and the experience served as an example for&#13;
              other municipal authorities inspiring them to consider similar projects. The knock on effects were seen in cities&#13;
              like JuayÃºa - a small municipal power that had the full backing of the local population to begin the construction&#13;
              of an environmentally valid and health promoting black water treatment plant in 2007.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The estimated shortfall of coverage of improved sanitation services infrastructure in 2005 was 49%, while the&#13;
     maximum expected for 2015 is 34%. The greatest requirement for infrastructure coverage is in the rural area&#13;
     where the 2005-2015 coverage deficit is 23%.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The country needs to commit approximately US$ 73 million per year in order to overcome this deficit by 2015.&#13;
     Most investment is needed in the urban area (US$ 51 million per year) as there is a downward tendency in&#13;
     numbers for the rural population as a result of rural-urban migration.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In recent years there has been a reduction in investments in water and sanitation from US$ 86 million in 1998	&#13;
     to around US$ 14 million in 2005. The gap between public and private investments in sanitation has been met&#13;
     in urban areas where building areas and house repairs have significantly increased.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion is a legal requirement in environmental regulations, but the limited input provided has been&#13;
     reinforced through efforts by municipal corporations in urban and rural areas where only limited programmes&#13;
     have been implemented.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Passive advances made in recent years (2005-2007), meaning that sanitation coverage is at the same percentage&#13;
     figure although actual numbers have changed. This is largely a result of vegetative population growth being&#13;
     covered by the interventions of various private and publicly funded housing projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The sanitation issue is dealt with only spontaneously and collaterally, as the real priority is seen to be drinking&#13;
     water.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are sufficient legal instruments to support growth of sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(a) In thousands of inhabitants.&#13;
(b) Improved installations, in both rural and urban areas.&#13;
(c) The best weighting is in the urban area. However, individual treatment solutions exist in rural areas, although these are few. Our estimate.&#13;
(c) The best impact is in the urban area. In rural areas there are individual collections and it is disposed of on the land.&#13;

                â&#128;¢	 In urban areas, local governments provide counterpart investment with funds from central government and&#13;
                           a high level of social participation occurs through the Development Councils.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Over the years various initiatives have been suggested to organise the sector.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 Municipal authorities have provided these services in a totally independent manner over the years, with no&#13;
                           regulation or control over technical and commercial operations and client relations from Central Government,&#13;
                           although limited monitoring and support on aspects related to water quality and health has been provided&#13;
                           by MSPAS.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 No resources are available to extend coverage and progress has been slow, especially amongst the poorest&#13;
                           sectors and the excluded sectors in rural zones.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 The greatest deficit sanitation service coverage occurs in rural areas of the country and in marginal urban&#13;
                           areas of the big cities. There is still a tendency for migration to urban areas, and greater investment is&#13;
                           required here in order to meet the ensuing population growth. In spite of this, the coverage deficit persists&#13;
                           in rural areas, particularly where settlement is sparse.&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Water and sanitation services acquire special significance in the light of cultural diversity. There are significant&#13;
   gaps in access to these services amongst the indigenous populations and the issue is further complicated&#13;
   by traditional views of water use and management in many indigenous communities that date back to&#13;
   ancestral times.&#13;

â&#128;¢	 There are sector policies and strategies on: the disposal of             interested in their application.&#13;
   excreta; the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of&#13;
   solid waste; and waste water treatment. Those referring to&#13;
   hygiene promotion and sanitation education are still in the development process.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Regulations for the Discharge and Reuse of Waste Water and Sewage Sludge Disposal, issued by the Ministry&#13;
   of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), and the proposed Regulation for the Management of&#13;
   Solid Waste are indicative of important links with environmental protection.&#13;

&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
Current legislation makes the municipal authority responsible for service provision for drinking water supply&#13;
and waste water; while the Ministry of Health, MARN and the Institute of Municipal Development (INFOM) have&#13;
some regulatory powers and governance functions. However, at present there is no division of functions and&#13;
these are undertaken in a partial, compartmentalised manner.&#13;

3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country.&#13;
Some institutions (INFOM, social funds) run sanitation education programs (directed at operation and&#13;
maintenance) as a element in projects. These are often short initiatives during the construction process and their&#13;
impact is not measured or monitored. There is an inconsistency in programmes between institutions, dependent&#13;
on the outlook of the body implementing the programme and the rules established by funders. The projects have&#13;
a limited impact focused only on programme beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
     1. There are no national plans or programmes for development of this issue.&#13;
&#13;
     2. There is a lack of leadership.&#13;

There are no plans for policies on subsidies, cost recovery or tariffs. There are no financial monitoring me-&#13;
chanisms. Income from tariffs on drainage systems in local governments are paid into drinking water supply&#13;
service funds. Income from solid waste collection tariffs is paid into municipal authorities general funds. There&#13;
is monitoring of national accounts, but water and sanitation usually appear as a single item.&#13;

&amp;#12;Guatemala      Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
               1. Reduction of the budget allocated by Central Government.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Absence of quality spending in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The indicators used are conventional and basically refer to percentage of coverage that can be disaggregated&#13;
            into urban and rural areas, municipal areas, departments or regions. The indicators used (information on the&#13;
            basis of a five-year census) do not reflect the quality of the sanitation service, nor customer satisfaction. In&#13;
            relation to additional information systems, these surveys only cover homes and living conditions. Sanitation is&#13;
            used as an analytical tool for complementary action in interventions by other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
               1. Absence of a particular and solid baseline.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Lack of specialised monitoring and control entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            There are sufficient adequately trained staff to meet MDG requirements. Sector leadership and focussed&#13;
            investment are pending issues. The use of technologies has also been developed, organised and promoted.&#13;

Successful experience: Water, source of peace.&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#152;Agua, fuente de pazâ&#128;&#153; water programme began in 1992 as a scheme to build drinking water and latrine&#13;
systems in rural zones experiencing extreme poverty. The project was executed in three stages, as a basic&#13;
model with central government, international co-operation and municipal authorities and communities working&#13;
together. The government and international co-operation funding contributed about 40% of the funds in equal&#13;
parts; the communities, a further 35%, and municipal governments and other local stakeholders (NGOs), 25%.&#13;
The former basically supplied materials, transport, qualified workers and sanitation, education; the communities&#13;
provided skilled workers and local materials; and the municipal authorities and other stakeholders, contributed&#13;
qualified labourers, additional transport and the remaining materials.&#13;
&#13;
During the first three years of operation, more than 800 communities - a population of approximately 283,000&#13;
people - were covered by the scheme.&#13;
&#13;
In 1996, this programme was transferred over to INFOM in order to support community efforts and those of&#13;
municipal authorities within the framework of a decentralisation policy.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In general, Guyana has achieved a â&#128;&#152;modest advanceâ&#128;&#153; toward achievement of the MDGs. However, the lack&#13;
    of exact information and data collection systems present serious challenges in terms of measurement. Goal 7&#13;
    (environmental sustainability) and 11 (access to sanitation) can â&#128;&#152;probablyâ&#128;&#153; be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Critical advances made toward the sanitation MDGs included the preparation of a Bill for a National Law on&#13;
    the Management of Solid Waste in 2004 that, once enacted, will be used to develop a National Strategy for&#13;
    Waste Management, a System for the Management of Used Oils and a Code of Practice for Solid Waste&#13;
    Management.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Reforms made for more efficient performance in the sector have included the Ministry of Health developing a&#13;
    National Strategy in 2004 in order to empower communities and allow them to assume greater responsibility for&#13;
    their own health. Other proposals include, the National Health Plan (PNS) 2003-2007, including the allocation of&#13;
    new funding and the more equitable reallocation of existing funds; the Ministry of Health Bill bringing in greater&#13;
    accountability and the regulation of various activities within the sector; the Regional Health Authority Bill proposing&#13;
    the reform of regional health services and the establishment of Regional Health Authorities; and the draft Bill for&#13;
    Health Promotion and Protection, which would cover public health, environment and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In September 2003, the Municipality of Georgetown established the Municipal Solid Waste Management&#13;
    Department in an effort to separate out the management of solid waste and to increase the authority and general&#13;
    independence of municipal services.&#13;

&amp;#12;         â&#128;¢	 The management of solid waste is considered to be a matter of political urgency on a national level.&#13;
Guyana&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Solid waste management is recognised as an interdisciplinary matter that requires an inter-agency&#13;
           perspective rather than mere technical specialisation.&#13;
&#13;
         Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The institutional solid waste management framework does not operate effectively in urban areas and is even&#13;
           worse in rural areas due to low levels of staffing.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The legal and regulatory frameworks are outdated and unrelated to modern standards for solid waste&#13;
           management.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Municipal authorities and the Neighbourhood Democratic Councils (NDCs) have limited capacity over the&#13;
           economic sustainability of solid waste management services, including charges to the public, setting costs&#13;
           and estimating suitable tariffs.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Data collection is limited and only refers to waste management. There is no information on impact on health&#13;
           indicators.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 There has been no awareness raising or community participation in solid waste management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 There is a lower percentage of population with access to improved sanitation in rural regions.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Communities in the interior of Guyana have low socio-economic and health indicators, and the lack of&#13;
           progress is widely attributed to the lack of appropriate water supply. Alternative sanitation options and&#13;
           better hygiene practices have not been presented in an integrated and participatory manner.&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Homes in rural zones of the interior and other interior regions of Guyana, have the lowest percentage figures&#13;
           for improved sanitation services.&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There is no national policy or strategy to deal effectively with sanitation or integrated waste management.&#13;
  However, national policy documents have identified integrated waste management as an area that requires&#13;
  attention in national development.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Three are sector policies and strategies on: hygiene promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of&#13;
  excreta, the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
  disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and&#13;
                                                         Critical aspects of sanitation policies and&#13;
  the treatment of waste water.&#13;
                                                         strategies&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Development Strategy (NDS) is            1. The solid waste management situation in Guyana&#13;
  one of the first political frameworks to define           reflects the lack of a coordinated programme of&#13;
  the Guyana development strategy. It outlines              effective services on a national level.&#13;
  priorities for economic and social development&#13;
                                                         2. No effective records or statistical information on&#13;
  in the country for the 2001-2010 period and has&#13;
                                                            solid waste is kept by the domestic, commercial,&#13;
  identified solid and liquid waste management&#13;
                                                            industrial, medical, agricultural, maritime or air&#13;
  as one of the main principles underpinning the&#13;
                                                            transport sectors.&#13;
  development policy.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Economic Recovery Programme (ERP)&#13;
  objective for the sanitation sector is to improve the sanitation conditions of the population in Georgetown and&#13;
  to reduce current levels of environmental degradation through improvements in the quality and availability of&#13;
  water supplies and drainage.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) 2001-2005 is the clearest declaration of national environmental&#13;
  strategy, which identifies environmental contamination and the integrated management of waste as two of&#13;
  the nine action areas of the programme.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
                            1. The regulations are obsolete, disjointed and unclear. The definitions, classification and categorisation&#13;
                                of solid wastes within the laws, regulations and standards are incoherent and diffuse.&#13;
&#13;
                            2. There is no clear definition of the function of each institution in monitoring fulfilment of solid waste&#13;
                                regulations, leading to weak fulfilment of legal resolutions.&#13;

                            regulation, service provision and governance functions for almost half of the city of Georgetown	&#13;
                            (the older section). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for standards on	&#13;
                            environmental protection and monitoring of the construction of sanitation works in new areas of	&#13;
                            housing. In situ sanitation is controlled by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development&#13;
                            (MLG&amp;RD) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), through NDCs or municipal authorities. The Ministry of	&#13;
                            Health also has some responsibility in the construction of sanitation works for new urban areas	&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Division of main functions between institutions&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The main functions of governance, regulation and service provision are not clearly divided. The main&#13;
     stakeholders are the Ministry of Health and the MOLGRD (including the respective municipal authorities and&#13;
     NDCs), EPA and the Ministry of Housing and Water, amongst other entities and ministries.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Around 10 RDCs, six municipal authorities and 129 NDCs have been established since 1980. The municipal&#13;
     authorities are responsible for the collection, transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste, for street&#13;
     cleaning and the cleaning of public spaces, water supplies, environmental health, street paving, markets,&#13;
     slaughterhouses and maintaining recreational spaces. The RDCs execute the functions delegated by central&#13;
     government, ministries or other entities.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 EPA plays a regulatory function for the management of solid waste. The Ministry of Housing and Water&#13;
     (MoH&amp;W) is responsible for urban settlements or groups of houses, where planning includes the consideration&#13;
     of solid waste management.&#13;

          â&#128;¢	 The Association for Advice on the Management of Solid Waste offers advocacy services to institutions&#13;
            involved in solid waste management and raises awareness of waste management issues.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
            1. Lack of human resources both in terms of quantity and training and education. The lack of&#13;
               awareness of solid waste management and its importance begins at the highest levels of&#13;
               government.&#13;
&#13;
            2. Monitoring and enforcement are not taking place, especially by the EPA, which is responsible for&#13;
               some of these tasks. The FSA completes some of these inspections, but they are generally very&#13;
               limited.&#13;

&#13;
          3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Health has a Health Education Department that is responsible for promoting health and&#13;
            good hygiene practices. The City Council Public Health Department also promotes good hygiene practices&#13;
            and responsible environmental practices.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 The EPA is working with the Guyana Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s Initiative to evaluate water, sanitation and health in the&#13;
            community, from a highly participatory perspective. Similarly, a water, sanitation and hygiene project has&#13;
            been developed for region three in association with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Housing and&#13;
            Water, with Department for International Development (DFID) backing.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Between 2005 and 2006, Oxfam carried out a pit latrine project for rural communities including&#13;
            demonstrations of how to build these.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Hygiene and environmental sanitation education was introduced in 20 primary schools as part of the&#13;
            Amazon project, in association with the Ministry of Health Environmental Health Unit. UNICEF also works&#13;
            with the Ministry of Education to develop family education in schools, including the promotion of healthy&#13;
            lifestyles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
            1. Information on environmental health related disease is not being made available through public&#13;
               education and awareness raising exercises.&#13;
&#13;
            2. Education and awareness raising programmes do not focus clearly on the safe management of&#13;
               human excreta, solid waste and safe final disposal of excreta. Hygiene promotion practices amongst&#13;
               health workers are limited to messages on the need to boil drinking water for children aged less&#13;
               than five-years-old.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;4. Funding&#13;
                                                                                                                                                        Guyana&#13;
&#13;
There have been no calculations of the funding required to achieve the MDGs. However, estimates provided for&#13;
similar countries suggest that current spending tendencies will fall significantly short of required spending on&#13;
infrastructure and other requirements. New injections of funds are needed to increase productive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Policies have been developed for subsidies, cost&#13;
recovery and tariffs for hygiene promotion and&#13;
sanitation education; the disposal of excreta; the                                                 Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
treatment of waste water; and the collection, treatment&#13;
                                                                                                   1. Insufficient funding from local land rates due&#13;
and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid&#13;
                                                                                                        to low collection rates and the low value of&#13;
waste.&#13;
                                                                                                        properties in the sector.&#13;
The sector is funded from local land rates and a 1%                                                2. There is no transparency of accounts&#13;
subsidy from central government. Municipal income                                                       and private investors are therefore not&#13;

city councils depend on central government for budget&#13;
subsidies and capital donations for maintenance and&#13;
other essential works.&#13;
&#13;
Planning in the solid waste sector is deficient as it is included in Government accounts as a separate	&#13;
budget item.&#13;

5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
National indicators for sanitation include â&#128;&#152;connection to the sewerage system or a septic tankâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;access to&#13;
solid waste collection and disposalâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
There is no data management system to monitor effective operation of the sector. However, the Bank of&#13;
Guyana is the main coordinator and producer of economic statistics, including national accounts.&#13;
&#13;
The IDB has given the government a loan of US$ 3.5 million to reinforce the Bank of Guyana and the statistical&#13;
capacity of the ministries in order to create and manage a social database.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                        101&#13;
&amp;#12;          Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
Guyana&#13;
          Increased access to improved sanitation facilities is generally seen as one of the main ways to relieve poverty.&#13;
          Both liquid and solid waste is considered damaging to the environment in terms of environmental pollution.&#13;
&#13;
          The National Development Strategy shows the impact of inappropriate environmental and natural resource&#13;
          management practices on human health and the environment. The contamination of both surface waters and&#13;
          ground waters has a serious impact on fishing resources in coastal and marine waters and the toxins go on&#13;
          to enter the human food chain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
            1. There is no data information management system for effective operation of the sanitation sector.&#13;
&#13;
            2. There is little information on the composition of solid waste, in particular for municipal authorities and&#13;
               NDCs outside Georgetown.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
          The Municipality of Georgetown has sufficient employees for solid waste management, while the other five&#13;
          municipalities have only 43 formal workers - 0.5 employees per 1,000 inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
          Municipal governments find it difficult to recruit trained staff and to provide financial support for the programmes.&#13;
          Deficient infrastructure, poor governance and management capacity and the lack of public confidence are&#13;
          challenges shared by all municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
          All university graduates are aware of the various aspects of sanitation management and are trained in related&#13;
          fields. Students have completed important research relating to the management of solid and liquid waste,&#13;
          including waste water treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
          Private recycling companies operate on a small scale and the government of Guyana is currently working on&#13;
          the first sanitation landfill site. This site will include waste separation services, gas collection and a recycling&#13;
          station will be established adjacent to the sanitation landfill site. There is a lack of knowledge on the suitable&#13;
          location, construction, operation and maintenance of latrines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
            1. The effectiveness and efficiency of services depend a great deal on the current level of funding in&#13;
               the sector.&#13;
&#13;
            2. There is high staff turnover, which generates a constant loss of improved capacity and a the&#13;
               knowledge base.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Section C: Recommendations                                                                                           Guyana&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The strategic sanitation plan must deal with the issue of liquid waste and define institutional functions&#13;
       and responsibilities. Special attention must be given to monitoring and evaluation components.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 There must be standardised formats for reports and variables in order for all stakeholders to interpret&#13;
       them in the same way. A single entity must be responsible for compiling and disseminating information&#13;
       between stakeholders in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Current legislation must be revised in order to evaluate overlaps, gaps and needs for updating. The&#13;
       functions of various organisations must be clearly defined.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Entities must ensure that standards have sufficient basis to become laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
    3.1 Hygiene promotion, excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
      domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Information, education and communication to increase awareness of the issue amongst citizens.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Train users to apply the new standards of the Guyana National Bureau of Standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 A legal unit must be established, and EPA staff must be trained in the appropriate legal procedures.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Government officials must be trained in sanitation matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	    3.3. Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Indicators must be prepared for the monitoring of environmental health, and information collection&#13;
       sheets must be made uniform.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 There must be increased awareness of standards on the issue among the general public. Public outreach&#13;
       programmes should improve in situ sanitation practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 A framework is needed to guarantee private sector participation, along with the formation of a more&#13;
       productive alliance with the private sector under a public sector initiative.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The sector framework must include incentives such as concessions, tax reductions, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 A baseline must be established for the measurement of performance indicators, which means tools&#13;
       such as computers, networks and trained staff will be needed.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Community participation in environmental monitoring must be revived.&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Urban Development Programme recommendations on tax systems must be implemented in order to&#13;
       improve municipal income and offer better salaries to employees in order to attract better qualified staff.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Participatory mechanisms are necessary to strengthen the functions of the regulatory bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     103&#13;
&amp;#12;Guyana&#13;
          Successful experience: the Guyana Amazon Programme&#13;
&#13;
          The Guyana Amazon Programme began with government contributions in 1994. UNICEF funded the&#13;
          project in order to try to level the disparity between social development and improved living conditions&#13;
          of children and women in the Amazonian region of Guyana. The sanitation component of the programme&#13;
          concentrates on the construction of improved ventilation latrines in regions 1 and 9. During the 2000-2002&#13;
          period, a total of 41 latrines were built in markets, infant and primary schools and 22 family homes. A total&#13;
          of approximately 9,962 people benefited from the scheme.&#13;
&#13;
          One of the main outcomes of this first phase was the preparation of a WUN kit (a Waspishana term meaning&#13;
          â&#128;&#152;waterâ&#128;&#153;). The kit includes educational materials in Wapishana and English, with illustrations by children and&#13;
          adults of the Deep South Rupununi zone, designed to serve as a learning guide in strengthening local&#13;
          capacity for the management of water resources and the improvement of environmental sanitation.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Haiti lags considerably behind the rest of the region of Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of indicators.&#13;
    This backwardness in all levels of basic sanitation is characterised by a very low rate of solid waste collection&#13;
    (around 30%); an enormous deficit in terms of equipment for the final disposal of excreta; marked institutional&#13;
    fragility; and an obsolete regulatory framework out of step with the current situation. The targets set include&#13;
    70% coverage for the collection of solid waste; 69% of the population with access to a latrine; updating and&#13;
    adaptation of the regulatory framework; institutional strengthening; the identification of sites and reconditioning&#13;
    of infrastructure (sanitary dump, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The strategy will be implemented with funding from the National Budget and international funding bodies&#13;
    (USAID, the World Bank and IDB), promoting activities linked to basic sanitation and achievement of both&#13;
    MDGs and national targets.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The funding and launch of this strategy has allowed for: road cleaning and refuse collection in the metropolitan&#13;
    area (US$ 6 million); reconditioning of the tip area (US$ 8 million); the purchase of materials and equipment&#13;
    (US$ 2.3 million); refuse collection (US$ 5 million); a waste management plan (compost) at Carrefour Feuilles&#13;
    (US$ 1.23 million); the Social Pacification programme (US$ 2 million); a basic sanitation programme in	&#13;
    CitÃ© Soleil (US$ 715,000); preparatory studies for the location of dumps in Jacmel/Cap HaÃ¯tien/GonaÃ¯ves/&#13;
    Saint Marc (US$ 370,000); sanitation in the city of Jacmel (US$ 3.9 million); and sanitation in CitÃ© Soleil	&#13;
    (US$ 350,000).&#13;

Haiti&#13;
          Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
          Strengths&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Political will for intervention in the sector.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Existence of consensus at the highest State level.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Proven interest of the private sector and financial entities.&#13;
&#13;
          Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Absence of cost recovery mechanism.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Lack of systems maintenance.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Lack of measures to provide incentives and encourage private-sector intervention.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Fragility of awareness raising and education programmes.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Insufficient trained technicians.&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Lack of monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
          Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
          Low levels of coverage in basic sanitation in rural and periurban areas and poor waste disposal practices&#13;
          encourage the development of disease. Moreover, insufficient investment in the sector does not allow for&#13;
          significant improvement of this situation.&#13;

                     3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
                     Hygiene promotion and sanitation education programs exist in the country, led by the Ministry of Public Health&#13;
                     in the Ministry of the Environment and some NGOs. The impact of these programmes has not yet been&#13;
                     evaluated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
                          1. Hygiene promotion and sanitation education neglected within the sanitation sector.&#13;
&#13;
                          2. There is weak coordination of activities between stakeholders.&#13;

Policies have not been developed for: subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
education; the disposal of excreta; the treatment of waste water; and the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste. There are no financial monitoring mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. Funding policies and mechanisms have been neglected within the sector.&#13;
&#13;
     2. There are no tariffs for sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
                                                                      Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring&#13;
The number of inhabitants with access to a latrine, and               and evaluation&#13;
the volume of waste disposed of in dumps are the main&#13;
                                                                      1. Follow up is not ongoing and has been&#13;
indicators used in the sector. The data collection system is&#13;
                                                                         neglected.&#13;
known as the Water and Sanitation Monitoring System.&#13;
                                                                      2. There is no monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The country is aware that existing human resources (governmental institutions, universities, training and research&#13;
centres, and the private sector) are insufficient in terms of the appropriately trained human resources required in&#13;
order to achieve the MDGs and national targets in sanitation, hygiene promotion and sanitation education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technologies are available to cover: refuse management and treatment; sanitary landfills; incineration, compost&#13;
production; the construction of latrines and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      111&#13;
&amp;#12;Haiti&#13;
              Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
              1. There is no continuity in the training of technicians within the sector and existing staff have not&#13;
                 been evaluated.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Funding for capacity training is insufficient and there is an ongoing brain drain effect.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          1. Policies and strategies&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 A Strategic Sanitation Plan must be produced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          2. Legal Framework&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Strengthening of the legal framework and accompaniment measures.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Improve lobbying mechanisms amongst members of Parliament and mobilise users and the general&#13;
                public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
               domestic waste water&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 A single institutional structure is needed for the sanitation sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Municipal authorities need to be strengthened in order to provide adequate management of solid waste.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Promote the creation of public-private joint ventures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          4. Funding&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Encourage the mobilisation of national and international funds to the sector.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Develop a tariff system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Consolidate mechanisms for the training of sanitation technicians.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Launch the application of appropriate technologies in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                           Haiti&#13;
Successful experience: Projects for solid waste collection&#13;
&#13;
A clear improvement has been seen in the collection and disposal of refuse with the installation of adapted&#13;
rubbish bins (metal containers). This project was funded by the French Development Agency and the IDB&#13;
with technical support from the Ministry of Public Works. A group of awareness raising agents contributed&#13;
to improving environmental health in the streets. There was active private sector participation, and the&#13;
media supported the experience mainly concentrating on awareness raising. Meanwhile, the Government&#13;
encouraged the creation of small businesses in the collection of organic waste and compost production. The&#13;
most noteworthy projects include a pilot project by Carrefour Feuilles funded by the UNDP with technical&#13;
support from the Ministry of the Environment; and the composting project at Quisqueya University.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Waste water treatment infrastructure coverage is 15% nationally. The Poverty Reduction Strategy (ERP) target&#13;
     is 50% coverage, but achievement of this will depend on political will and the availability of human and financial&#13;
     resources for the construction and operation of new wastewater treatment plants, at least in the main cities of&#13;
     Honduras.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Coverage in drainage and latrines â&#128;&#147; a system as yet unsustainable in the country â&#128;&#147; stood at 76.9% nationally&#13;
     for 2006. The ERP sets a target of 95%, a level difficult to accomplish because of the financial requirements&#13;
     and capacity available in the country. The disposal of excreta, through sewerage systems and latrines stands at&#13;
     88.5% although there is no consideration of the waste water treatment.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There has been some analysis of projects underway and the projects required in order to fulfil the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Funding must be found from national GDP in order to close the gap between existing services and MDG targets.&#13;
     Progress is being made in urban areas with the installation of purification plants, while a healthy homes and&#13;
     schools programme (ESCASAL) is under way in rural and periurban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Modernisation of the sector has begun. However, four years after implementation of the water and sanitation&#13;
     framework legislation, institutions are still weak and the strategies and policies designed are awaiting discussion&#13;
     and approval by the National Council for Water and Sanitation (CONASA) in the coming 18 months.&#13;

                â&#128;¢	 The institutional roles are clear, as service provision has been separated from regulation and technical&#13;
                          support, and from the formulation of sector policies and strategies.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 A plan for the integrated management of solid and liquid waste has been implemented - including physical&#13;
                          and ecological considerations for hazardous waste - with community, inter-agency and intersector&#13;
                          participation.&#13;

&#13;
           Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           There has been no monitoring of access to appropriate sanitation systems in marginal areas and amongst&#13;
           indigenous populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           There is inequitable access to a water supply for unprotected sectors in peripheral neighbourhoods around&#13;
           cities, and residents can pay up to 100 times the minimum tariff for water supplies per cubic metre for&#13;
           deliveries from private water transporters. Changes to the system require both drinking water and sewerage&#13;
           treatment in these areas of cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Rural areas have self-administration through 5,000 Water Administration Boards; but there is a lack of effective&#13;
           State accompaniment to ensure the upkeep of sanitation systems, mainly latrines.&#13;

                          of sewerage sludge and solid waste; and the treatment&#13;
                                                                                                                     1. Very slow progress toward&#13;

&#13;
                â&#128;¢	 None of the above policies is considered within the                                               2. Financial policy is not clearly defined.&#13;

                          mechanism is being revised and there should be sections&#13;
                          on future actions to be completed.&#13;

                      Each institution fulfilled its function and, where aqueducts&#13;
                      exist, the Autonomous National Service of Aqueducts and Drainage (SANAA) works specifically on the&#13;

                      Sanitation Network (RASHON), the Water and Sanitation Sector Board and the Honduras Association of&#13;

                         Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
                         1. Municipal authorities have insufficient capacity for solid waste management due to the lack of&#13;
                             awareness of hygiene aspects amongst the population.&#13;
&#13;
                         2. Solid waste management is not considered a priority. Institutionality is weakened, as the&#13;
                             responsibility all falls to municipal authorities, reducing intervention in the sector to a single actor.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
                                                                                                                                                         Honduras&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
Honduras runs the Healthy Homes and Schools programme (ESCASAL) and others with similar aims under the&#13;
Ministry of Health, SANAA and the Ministry of Education. Their impact is mainly in the rural area, where they&#13;
have been employed with greater regularity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
     1. The ESCASAL programme is not used as an official criterion for other initiatives in the same area.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Hygiene and sanitation education policies are not applied as rigorously in urban areas.&#13;

(1) According to the August 2007 sector plan (ERP), education promotion and sewage sludge management are not considered separately.&#13;
Source: ERP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policies have been developed for subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
disposal of solid waste and for the disposal of excreta and treatment of waste water to some extent. Such&#13;
policies have not been planned for health promotion and sanitation education and the collection, treatment and&#13;
sanitary disposal of sewage sludge. Financial monitoring mechanisms are in place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. Solid waste disposal quotas are paid once a year within local land and property tax, and there is great&#13;
         resistance to payment due to the poor services offered by responsible companies and institutions.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Equitable payment for the maintenance of treatment plants has not been established as part of the&#13;
         tariff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                         119&#13;
&amp;#12;           5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
Honduras&#13;
           The Rural Aqueduct System (SIAR), the National Information System on Water and Sanitation in Honduras&#13;
           (SINAPSH) and the National System of Municipal Information (SINIMUN) have been created. Sanitation has&#13;
           only been included in mid-level analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
              1. No thorough fulfilment of the laws.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Institutional weakness due to a lack of economic capacity to recruit staff for monitoring and control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
           Staff training is discussed whenever policies, strategies or investment plans are dealt with. However, there is no&#13;
           plan to monitor the achievement of training projects, like the diploma courses on environmental aspects aimed&#13;
           at mid-level officials in municipal authorities provided by universities. Informal training also occurs in hygiene&#13;
           campaigns. No links have yet been formed between these programmes in order to achieve the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
           Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
           Hygiene promotion technologies are available through, SANAA technicians, NGOs and the Ministry of Health.&#13;
           Institutional weakness hampers achievement of the MDGs, as investments are not channelled through or&#13;
           approved by CONASA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
              1. Insufficient installed capacity1.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Lack of cooperation and follow up by stakeholders.&#13;

&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Appropriate institutional frameworks exist under the drinking water and sanitation framework law and&#13;
      other State modernisation tools.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Existing institutional capacity must be increased.&#13;
&#13;

Successful experience: Healthy Schools and Homes Project&#13;
&#13;
Joint work between SANAA and UNICEF from 1996, led to the ESCASAL project which arose in response to the&#13;
statement that the mere implementation of a sanitation services infrastructure alone would not necessarily lead&#13;
to favourable change in community hygiene and environmental health practices.&#13;
&#13;
Results indicate that under the project: communities experienced favourable changes in hygiene and sanitation&#13;
habits; indices of illness caused by poor water use reduced; there was greater female participation in project&#13;
activities; community organisation was strengthened and citizen awareness improved; and healthy hygiene&#13;
practices were disseminated through the â&#128;&#152;visitor committeesâ&#128;&#153; made up of community members.&#13;
&#13;
The most important lessons learned included: community participation is essential in order to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the intervention; teaching materials must be adapted to the community context; the community&#13;
can be stimulated by the possibility of accessing the service; community-based technicians work best; female&#13;
participation is necessary as an equity criterion; and that children should included as the target audience, and&#13;
their impact can be used as a form of improving attitudes and skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                   121&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Data from WHO indicate the percentage of the population with sustainable access to improved sanitation was&#13;
     80% in 2004. This percentage stands at 91% in the urban sector, while it is only 69% in the rural sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Current low levels of waste water treatment and disposal mean that domestic waste water causes serious&#13;
     contamination in surface and ground waters. Current waste water disposal systems do not contribute much in&#13;
     terms of treatment, and the cost of good mechanical technological systems (activated sludge, oxidation troughs,&#13;
     etc.) is extremely high.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Approximately 2,500 tonnes/day of waste is generated across the island. Around 72% - approximately 1,300&#13;
     tonnes/day â&#128;&#147; of this is collected. There is a hybrid collection service operated by public and private service&#13;
     providers. The State is the only provider of solid waste management services in some water catchment areas.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation and hygiene are not currently included as separate subjects on the primary and secondary school&#13;
     curricula. No specific attention is given to the significance and importance of hygiene and sanitation, the role of&#13;
     the child and the consequences of inadequate hygiene and sanitation practices.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 It is highly possible that Jamaica will exceed the MDGs and the ministries and agencies involved have set very&#13;
     ambitious national goals.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Many of the worst affected rural areas and marginal urban communities are still not getting the level of attention&#13;
     they need, as there is often confusion between local and national institutions on roles and responsibilities for&#13;
     urban development, the cleaning of streams and drains, solid waste management, and city planning and&#13;
     development.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2005, the Government of Jamaica started to formulate a National Sanitation Policy with a Special Multi-&#13;
     disciplinary Sanitation Unit to promote it. The objective was to unite existing sanitation policy elements into a&#13;
     single policy while solving problems in the sector that are not covered by any existing policy. The policy is still&#13;
     being negotiated and it has yet to be adopted and implemented as a national policy by Government.&#13;

&amp;#12;          â&#128;¢	 Some of the objectives are already covered in existing policies like the National Solid Waste Management&#13;
Jamaica     Policy and the Water Sector Policy and some of the strategies are being implemented. When the Sanitation&#13;
            Policy is totally implemented, Jamaica will achieve its national goals and, by extension, the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
          Strengths&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Clear identification of the problems in a documented form.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Recognition that sanitation is a multidisciplinary/multisector matter related to housing, water supply, waste&#13;
            water disposal, solid waste management, the maintenance of streams and drains, healthcare, environmen-&#13;
            tal management, poverty and education - all issues which currently present difficulties as no ministry or&#13;
            agency assumes total responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Existence of policies focussed on many important aspects of sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Existence of institutions implementing sanitation programmes. National Environment and Planning Agency,&#13;
            National Solid Waste Management Authority, Ministry of Health and Environment, Ministry of Water and&#13;
            Housing.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Urban sanitation is quite good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 There is no single policy covering all aspects of sanitation and allowing stakeholders to work toward the&#13;
            achievement of common goals.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Confusion between local and national government institutions on roles and responsibilities in relation to&#13;
            urban development, the cleaning of streams and drains, solid waste management and town planning and&#13;
            development in cities.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Insufficient cooperation between NGOs, CBOs, members of the community, local and national government&#13;
            institutions in identifying the roots of sanitation problems and contributing effective and lasting solutions&#13;
            better suited to communities.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Implementation of water projects without due consideration of the related waste water disposal&#13;
            infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Less attention on rural sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Insufficient understanding of the link between water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and its impact on&#13;
            poverty, school attendance, productivity and economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Failure to resolve the problem of informal settlements (land invasions).&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Systems insufficient for resolving sanitation problems related to natural disasters (hurricanes and floods),&#13;
            that increase incidences of water borne diseases.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Inadequate uptake, management, use, access and socialisation of information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 The Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), rural areas and other cities show positive tendencies in access to&#13;
            water closets in homes, but it is clear that far greater access is available in urban areas - like KMA and other&#13;
            cities - than in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
    124&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 It is clear that there is still significant use of pit latrines in Jamaica, especially in rural areas. In some rural&#13;
  areas up to 56.5% of people use pit latrines or some other method of excreta disposal. Some of these are                Jamaica&#13;
  dependent on environmental factors such as inappropriate soil conditions or proximity to water sources that&#13;
  impede the use of toilets with septic tanks and soak aways or any access to drainage systems.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Recognition of the fact that children spend a significant amount of time in school and that they learn many&#13;
  social skills in the school environment means the availability of adequate sanitation is very important for the&#13;
  wellbeing of children. In State schools, from preschool to secondary, pit latrines are still being used in sig-&#13;
  nificant numbers, especially in rural areas. Even though many schools are equipped with toilets and piped&#13;
  water, the infrastructure is frequently not in satisfactory conditions.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 As for solid waste, rural parishes, especially in the southeast and northeast of the country have low collection&#13;
  levels and this means some solid waste is eliminated in an inadequate manner. While the tourist areas of the&#13;
  northeast (Retirement) and the areas of the southeast/metropolitan areas (Riverton) have better collection&#13;
  coverage, there are areas that have irregular or no collection, resulting in the same problem. Marginal urban&#13;
  communities affected by hygiene-related illnesses still do not have the level of attention they need. In spite&#13;
  of this, the government has implemented community outreach programmes through entities such as the&#13;
  National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) in order to educate people on adequate techniques&#13;
  for the disposal of non-biodegradable materials, especially those â&#128;&#147; such as plastic - that present a health&#13;
  hazard when dumped or incinerated.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Studies on other developing nations have shown the lack of access to water and sanitation largely affects&#13;
  women in poor homes, as they spend a large part of their day fetching water for their many tasks in the&#13;
  home.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Data from the Ministry of Health for the 2002-2004 period indicated a general increase in the incidence of&#13;
  gastroenteritis during the five-year period, which could be attributed to a combination of a greater number&#13;
  of reported cases, or to greater problems with sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Section B: Summary of the sanitation situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Great importance is given to sanitation in public policy in Jamaica. However, inadequate inter-ministerial&#13;
  and inter-agency cooperation and limited resources prevent the effective implementation of these policies.&#13;
  The Water Sector Policy, the National Solid Waste Management Policy and the Poverty Eradication Policy&#13;
  approach some important aspects of sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Government of Jamaica also provides an Investment and Development Manual with guidance for waste&#13;
  management and infrastructure system providers and investors when systems are needed for excreta&#13;
  disposal. This document was produced through inter-ministerial and inter-agency cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
  1. The links between policies have not been well defined. Conflicts sometimes result in the suboptimal&#13;
      use of scarce resources. The long-term beneficial impact of some programmes are never&#13;
      understood.&#13;
&#13;
  2. There is no governing institution to ensure the implementation of policy.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                          125&#13;
&amp;#12;          â&#128;¢	 Other similar documents â&#128;&#152;Guidelines for dealing with squatters including prevention, eviction, relocation&#13;

&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Policies and strategies are in place on: hygiene promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of excreta;&#13;
              the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and the treatment of&#13;
              waste water.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
              1. Various regulations related to sanitation are in draft form waiting for approval and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Insufficient financial provision and staff for the effective implementation of all sanitation- related&#13;
                 regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
There is a division of functions, but the entities have dual roles in some cases. The Ministry of Health and the&#13;
Environment, the Ministry of Housing and water and the local authorities are responsible for management. The&#13;
National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA), the Ministry of Health and the Environment, local authorities&#13;
and the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) are responsible for regulation. The National Water Commission&#13;
(NWC) and the private sector service are the service providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The functions are generally fulfilled, but there is room for improvement.&#13;

&#13;
   Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
   1. There is no ownership of the sanitation sector, which is weakening the effectiveness of the National&#13;
       Sanitation Task Force.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Users and NGOs are not always sufficiently involved in the development of policies, laws and the&#13;
       implementation of projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
&#13;
There is some division of the main functions related to the collection, treatment and sanitary elimination&#13;
of solid waste, but there are problems pending. Governance is under of the Office of the Prime Minister&#13;
(Local Government Portfolio), the Ministry of Local Government, local authorities and the Ministry of Health&#13;
and Environment. The NSWMA is responsible for regulation; establishing and monitoring fulfilment of legal&#13;
standards for the storage, collection, transportation, treatment and elimination of solid waste. Local authorities,&#13;
the Ministry of Health and the Environment and NEPA also play a role.&#13;
&#13;
NSWMA is responsible for providing the service through regional companies and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
The platforms for coordination include the National Sanitation Task Force.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
             Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
             1. Double role of NSWMA as regulator and service provider needs amendment in order for it to function&#13;
                 only as regulator, in accordance with policy.&#13;
&#13;
             2. Greater community and private sector participation must be developed in the collection, recycling&#13;
                 and elimination of solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
          The Ministry of Housing and Water, the Ministry of Health and Environment, NEPA and NSWMA are the key&#13;
          institutions involved in sanitation education and hygiene promotion.&#13;
&#13;
          The Ministry of Health and Environment implements an Environmental Health programme working on health&#13;
          promotion and disease prevention by monitoring environmental factors in order to ensure a safe and healthy&#13;
          environment.&#13;
&#13;
          The Rural Water and Sanitation Programme is an initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Water (funded by the&#13;
          IDB), that operates in association with the health authorities, NEPA and the NSWMA.&#13;
&#13;
          The Whitehorses, Botany Bay &amp; Pamphret&#13;
          Development Benevolent Society has selected                                    Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and&#13;
          and trained several WASH promoters and has                                     sanitation education&#13;
          completed a survey on sanitation at home. The Mile                             1. Community initiatives are not adequately&#13;

          quality of life and food handling.&#13;
&#13;
    128&#13;
&amp;#12;The Gravel Hill Beneficent Society, in association with the Ministry of Education, has worked to improve&#13;
access to sanitation installations at a local primary school.                                                     Jamaica&#13;
&#13;
The Five Star Development Beneficiary Society, in association with the Rural Water Programme, the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Lands, NSWMA, NWC, RADA, SDC, the Forestry Department, the Jamaica Environment&#13;
Foundation, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the International Development Research Centre&#13;
(IDRC), improved waste collection and the access to sanitation installations in several communities.&#13;
&#13;
These programmes have had an impact, but interventions must be repeated in other communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
According to a report from the IDB in 2004, the level of investment required to fulfil the national goals/&#13;
MDGs stand at US$ 254 million for the disposal of excreta and US$ 514 million for municipal solid waste&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
Policies have been developed on: subsidies, cost&#13;
recovery and tariffs for the disposal of excreta; the           Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage           1. There is a culture of non-payment for water&#13;
sludge and solid waste; and the treatment of waste                 supplies and sewerage, whereby recovery&#13;
water. Such policies have not been planned for                     of costs is very difficult.&#13;
hygiene promotion and sanitation education.                     2. Sanitation, in particular rural sanitation,&#13;
&#13;
The government has stated its commitment to the                    is not given the same social and political&#13;
&#13;
cost recovery mechanisms of the Jamaica National                   attention as drinking water supply,&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Plan (JANEAP, 1994:6). The Solid                     whereby lower levels of funding are&#13;
&#13;
Waste Management Policy also covers the polluter                   available for improvements.&#13;
&#13;
pays principle and cost recovery mechanisms and&#13;
incentives. The Water Sector Policy mentions a cost&#13;
recovery mechanism sufficient to maintain good water supply and drainage services whilst also taking into&#13;
account social considerations where necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Some financial monitoring mechanisms are already in place. Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) regulates ta-&#13;
riffs for water supplies and drainage. The Office of the Prime Minister (Local Government Portfolio) monitors&#13;
the use of property tax funds for waste collection and disposal services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Indicators used for the disposal of excreta include: the percentage of population with access to improved&#13;
   sanitation; the concentration of faecal coliforms in fresh water; the percentage of the population connected&#13;
   to drainage systems; the percentage of the population with access to toilets; and the quantity of sewage&#13;
   treatment plants that fulfil the NRCA sewage effluent standards.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Indicators for solid waste management include the quantity of municipal and industrial solid waste&#13;
   generated; collection coverage; the amount of dangerous waste generated; road cleaning coverage; the&#13;
   amount of waste taken to the disposal site; the rate of recycling and reuse.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are several information systems in the Ministry of Health, NEPA, the Ministry of Water and Housing,&#13;
   NSWMA and the Water Resources Authority. But they are not necessarily interrelated. Agencies like the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  129&#13;
&amp;#12;             Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) and the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) collect and compile&#13;
Jamaica      information on sanitation from various agencies and independent surveys including the Population&#13;
             Censuses and the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions respectively. NEPA has previously produced&#13;
             reports on the state of the environment which give an indication of the national situation in sanitation and&#13;
             environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
&#13;
          There are only weak connections between instruments and indicators linking sanitation to social issues such&#13;
          as poverty, health and literacy, as well as economic issues such as productivity and GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
              1. Data collection must be made relevant and executed consistently, access to information must be&#13;
                 linked to a single source, for example: STATIN or PIOJ.&#13;
&#13;
              2. Sanitation information should be reported at a higher level, in parliament for instance, to drive&#13;
                 forward the idea of effective monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
          Various attempts have been made to analyse human resource capacity for economic development in general,&#13;
          and also for sanitation and public health. However, this analysis is not necessarily related to achievement of&#13;
          the national targets/MDGs on sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
          One concern that has arisen is the lack&#13;
          of local opportunities for specialised&#13;
          training in some critical areas of             Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
          sanitation and the resulting limitations&#13;
                                                         1. There is a lack of analysis of the human resources&#13;
          on specialist skills. This has a knock-&#13;
                                                            situation in the sanitation area and greater integration&#13;
          on effect on the efficient operation of&#13;
                                                            is needed between supply and demand in research and&#13;
          sanitation installations such as a waste&#13;
                                                            training.&#13;
          water treatment plants and sanitary&#13;
          landfills.                                     2. Opportunities are needed for specialist training in&#13;
                                                            critical sanitation and areas such as the management&#13;
          Most waste water plants are staffed               of sanitary landfill, the development of alternative&#13;
          by operators who lack the necessary               techniques for the treatment of solid waste such as&#13;
          technical knowledge. Most of the sites            recycling, and the treatment of waste water.&#13;
          do not have documented operation&#13;
          and maintenance procedures. Some&#13;
          operators are self taught.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
          The country has access to technology for the management and elimination of excreta and solid waste.	&#13;
          The main problem is resourcing (human and financial) in order to implement the technologies.&#13;

&amp;#12;Section C: Recommendations                                                                                            Jamaica&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Waters and Housing must ensure that the National Sanitation&#13;
      Policy is completed and implemented.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Policies and strategies relating or connecting to sanitation, some already existing, must organise the&#13;
      roles and responsibilities of ministers and agencies in order to establish a basis for development stra-&#13;
      tegies and plans of action that will achieve the goals and objectives.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 A detailed integrated National Sanitation Policy must be developed, considering specific areas such&#13;
      as: waste management and environmental issues; economics, housing, health and education.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Sanitation Task Force must be institutionalised in order to thus promote the implementation of&#13;
      policy strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 All Bills on sanitation must be processed quickly. These include the Act for Water Supply and Drainage&#13;
      Services (Ministry of Waters and Housing); and the National Solid Waste Management Act.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Implement recommendations to the Waste Water Management Policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
     domestic waste water&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Revise the roles and responsibilities of ministries and agencies and restructure these, where necessary&#13;
      in order to eliminate overlap, fill gaps and clearly define the extent of the responsibilities and interrela-&#13;
      tion between entities.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Environment in conjunction with the Ministry of Waters&#13;
      and Housing and NSWMA must cooperate in order to produce public hygiene promotion messages&#13;
      and to maintain a sustained programme.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Education needs to include hygiene as a specific element in primary and secondary&#13;
      programmes of study.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Waters and the Ministry of Health and Environment need to focus more on rural sa-&#13;
      nitation issues and to ensure that there is a safe method for the management and disposal of waste&#13;
      waters wherever a water supply is established.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion must be an integrated part of all water and sanitation programmes and projects.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Civil society must join the government in tackling sanitation issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Office of the Prime Minister and the Local Government Portfolio must work with local authorities&#13;
      and the NSWMA to drive forward waste collection and the operation of sanitary landfill sites, and to&#13;
      implement cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The solid waste management authority must run more social outreach programmes to educate people&#13;
      in rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Government must develop a funding strategy for sanitation and increase budget allocation through&#13;
      the Ministries of Health, Environment and Waters and Housing.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Stimulate private sector participation in sanitation projects offering incentives like those outlined in the&#13;
      Water Sector Policy.&#13;
                                                                                                                      131&#13;
&amp;#12;          5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
Jamaica&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 The Government must decide which entity or ministry will be responsible for monitoring sanitation&#13;
                 nationally.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Agree indicators to evaluate the sanitation situation in relation to national targets and MDGs and es-&#13;
                 tablish systems for the ongoing collection of relevant information.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 The effectiveness of the implementation of policy goals and objectives must be activated and monito-&#13;
                 red by the National Sanitation Labour Force.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Establish the need to present an annual report to Parliament on the sanitation situation in Jamaica.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Involve communities and gender criteria in monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Provide more opportunities for specialist training to strengthen skills and attitudes in the Sanitation&#13;
                 Task Force.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Support community empowerment in adopting sanitation practices and options that are both&#13;
                 accessible and environmentally safe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Successful experience: Rural Water and Sanitation Programme&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The Ministry of Water and Housing worked in association with the Rural Water and Sanitation Programme,&#13;
          the Public Health authorities, NEPA, NSWMA and the Whitehorses, Botany Bay &amp; Pamphret Development&#13;
          Benevolent Society to train several WASH promoters and to complete a house to house sanitation survey.&#13;
          The organisation worked with the Public Health Department, the Environment Foundation of Jamaica (EFJ),&#13;
          UNEP, USAID and the Jamaica Social Investment Fund JSIF to achieve the success. The programme&#13;
          benefited 61 homes and has increased access to sanitation installations, improved refuse collection,&#13;
          improved excreta disposal and has also raised the self-esteem of the beneficiaries of the programme.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 According to the outcome of the Population and Housing Survey 2005, national coverage for drainage and basic&#13;
    sanitation (latrines) is 85.6% - an achievement that has allowed the country to reach the goals set in the MDGs.&#13;
    National coverage of 86.2% is expected by December 2007; 94.5% in the urban environment and 59.2% in rural&#13;
    zones.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 These advances are the outcome of extension of the sewerage network on a national level and the installation of&#13;
    ecological sanitation in rural zones, meaning a further 35.6 million people have been provided with a service: 26&#13;
    million in urban areas and 9.6 million in rural zones.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 While the coverage levels achieved are considered reasonable, increases must still be made, mainly in rural areas&#13;
    where there is a greater deficit. The National Water Programme 2007-2012 has targets for national sewerage&#13;
    coverage of 88% (63% in rural areas and 95.6% in urban zones).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Investments of US$ 2.7 billion will be required to achieve these objectives, US$ 500 million for the rural sector&#13;
    and US$ 2.2 billion for the urban sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 New funding mechanisms must be introduced by all three levels of government for the building of&#13;
    infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Technical and financial capacity must be strengthened in order for the systems to be operational.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Tariffs charged for the service do not reflect operation, maintenance and depreciation costs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The legal and regulatory frameworks need to be adapted.&#13;

          â&#128;¢	 Avoid the politicisation of decisions.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 There is no planning for medium and long-term investment programmes.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Technical staff in operating entities are on temporary contracts, whereby there is no continuity in service&#13;
                         quality.&#13;

          â&#128;¢	 Materials are needed for waste coverage and the control of biogas and leaching.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
          In Mexico, urban zones have the highest sewerage coverage. There are 185,000 rural locations that are home&#13;
          to the poorest population and that have low levels of service coverage. Many of these are in south-eastern&#13;
          Mexico, where coverage is lowest. These locations are generally scattered settlements and their physical&#13;
          geography makes the installation of formal sanitation systems considerably more difficult.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
          1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Sanitation services are extremely important to the Mexican Government and coverage has been established&#13;
                         as the second objective of the National Water Plan 2007-2012. Policies and sector strategies are in place&#13;
                         on: hygiene promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of excreta; the collection, treatment and&#13;
                         sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and the treatment of waste water. These policies&#13;
                         and strategies were covered by the National Hydraulic Programme 2000 - 2006 and still stand under the&#13;
                         National Water Programme (PNH) 2007 â&#128;&#147; 2012, in the following threads: i) treatment of waste water and&#13;
                         promotion of reuse and exchange; ii) increase the number of people with access to drinking water and&#13;
                         sewerage systems in rural communities, encouraging the sustainability of services; and iii) increase the&#13;
                         number of people with drinking water and sewerage services in urban communities.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Work is presently underway on the a national programme for integrated waste prevention and management,&#13;
                         a document that explores the funding needed to resolve the issue in almost 100 locations in the coming&#13;
                         five-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    136&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Social Development SEDESOL Habitat Programme provides infrastructure for the integrated&#13;
    management of solid urban waste in marginal urban zones. It currently runs programmes in Guerrero,&#13;
                                                                                                                Mexico&#13;
    Oaxaca and Tamaulipas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
    1. Insufficient financial resources for the construction of new infrastructure at all three levels of&#13;
       government.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Lack of technical and financial capacity for the operation of systems, resulting in the implementation&#13;
       of tariffs that do not reflect operation and maintenance costs.&#13;

&amp;#12;            3. Institutional framework&#13;
Mexico&#13;
            3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
            There is a clear division of functions. Federal Government is responsible for governance and regulation on	&#13;
            a national level, regulating the application of laws, regulations and standards that come under its jurisdiction&#13;
            in coordination with the state governments. Environmental issues (water, air and solid waste) are dealt with	&#13;
            by SEMARNAT, in coordination with the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) and the Federal Prosecutor&#13;
            for Environmental issues (PROFEPA) that are decentralized entities.&#13;
&#13;
            By law, service provision is the responsibility of municipal authorities, but they can work in coordination with&#13;
            state governments to provide the service if they require.&#13;
&#13;
            In many cities and other locations, the state government is in charge of service provision as municipal authorities&#13;
            do not have the technical, economic and administrative capacity, nor do they have many of the resources&#13;
            needed to carry out these functions efficiently.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Platforms for coordination between stakeholders&#13;
            Intersector coordination occurs through the Development Planning Committees (COPLADES), where&#13;
            representatives of federal, state and municipal instances work together on drinking water and sanitation&#13;
            projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
                  1. Greater coordination is required between related institutions that contribute to sanitation&#13;
                       development from different perspectives.&#13;
&#13;
                  2. Works must be executed promptly and follow-up provided in order for them to deliver the planned&#13;
                       benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Municipal authorities are responsible for all functions. These are mostly executed in a deficient manner, as&#13;
            there is a lack of professional outlook amongst institutional post-holders; they are not provided with sufficient&#13;
            information for decision-making and they lack economic resources (no charges are made for the service in&#13;
            most municipal areas of the country).&#13;
&#13;
    138&#13;
&amp;#12;    Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management                                     Mexico&#13;
    1. Ignorance of integrated waste management amongst municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Waste management given a low priority amongst municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene&#13;

                                                                      and sanitation education&#13;
Cultura del Agua (Water Culture) is a CONAGUA program&#13;
                                                                      1. The scattered nature of the locations&#13;
that promotes and executes education campaigns on&#13;
                                                                         and difficulties in access have ham-&#13;

                                                                         difficult access.&#13;
of latrines for public health. Similar programmes were run by&#13;
the Health Ministry (SS) Brigades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policies have been developed for subsidies, recovery of costs and tariffs to help hygiene promotion and&#13;
sanitation education (through the Federal Government and state governments). This type of policy has not&#13;
been considered for the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Federal Government has provided support for building sewage works in various parts of the country, using&#13;
resources from several programmes for the purposes for: excreta disposal; the collection, treatment and&#13;
sanitary disposal of sewage sludge; and waste water treatment. Costs are recovered through: adjustments to&#13;
service tariffs; service provider organisations; the authorisation of municipal councils or state congresses; or&#13;
through state or municipal subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Federal Government is responsible for monitoring investments made and the works executed through its&#13;
various constituent institutions.  &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
    1. Low profitability of service providers due to poor administration and low tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Sanitation services are not charged for in many parts of the country as they are not included in the&#13;
       tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	                                                                                                                  139&#13;

          Access to sewage services and waste water treatment             and evaluation&#13;
          coverage are the main indicators used. CONAGUA has              1. Greater application and fulfilment of cu-&#13;
          data systems, through which it can monitor the various             rrent regulations is required, along with&#13;
          programmes implemented to extend the coverage of                   simplification of this legislation.&#13;
          its services. At present it is working on implementation&#13;
                                                                          2. Waste water treatment programmes are&#13;
          of the National Water Information System (SINA) which&#13;
                                                                             needed to verify installations and opera-&#13;
          unites information from all the various systems in order&#13;
                                                                             tional outcomes.&#13;

          more easily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
          Sanitation has been incorporated into analysis of national issues as it forms part of the chain of cause and&#13;
          effect. The higher the sanitation index, the lower the incidence of water borne disease, the higher the reuse of&#13;
          water in added-value agricultural products, and the greater the prospects of improving industrial and tourist&#13;
          development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          National reflection on human resources to&#13;
          achieve the MDGs/national targets                          Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
          Degree and masterâ&#128;&#153;s programmes have been                   1. Changes of staff in state and municipal&#13;
          developed in environmental engineering in several             administrations (every six and three years&#13;
          universities in the country in view of the need to            respectively) impacts on the adequate&#13;
          train more technicians in sanitation-related issues.          performance of most service providers.&#13;
          The training will provide staff for recruitment into the   2. Lack of knowledge of laws, regulations and&#13;
          various bodies at the three levels of government.             ecological standards by municipal authorities&#13;
          It will also be important for these trained staff to          and service providers and failure to fulfil&#13;
          be employed by service providers and entities                 these.&#13;
          responsible for sanitation education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/&#13;
          national targets&#13;
          The necessary technologies are available in Mexico, but technical staff training is needed for service providers.&#13;
          The country would benefit from the application of successful sanitation experiences from other developing&#13;
          countries, complemented by technology exchange within the framework of national development.&#13;

The Monterrey Water and Drainage Services are responsible for the drinking water, sewage distribution&#13;
and waste water treatment services in the city of Monterrey, Nueva LeÃ³n. It is a â&#128;&#152;healthyâ&#128;&#153; entity in both&#13;
administrative and financial terms, having a high level of efficiency in operations, maintenance and technical&#13;
matters. It has made great advances in efficient use of the infrastructure and the treatment and reuse of&#13;
waste water, placing it firmly in the national, and even international, vanguard.&#13;
&#13;
The service provides sewerage coverage for 98% of the population and treatment for 100% of the waste&#13;
water and sludge it collects, keeping local natural receptor bodies clean. Around 20% of the reused treated&#13;
water goes to agricultural and industrial ends (1,500 to 2,000 l/s), leaving more fresh water available for&#13;
urban services.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 According to the 2005 Census, total sanitation coverage was 84.4% (96.1% in the urban zone and 69.2% in rural&#13;
    areas) - a level that has allowed fulfilment of the MDG goal of 73.3%.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There has been a significant increase in coverage in rural areas since the water and sanitation programmes&#13;
    began in 1976.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 This data is different to that presented in the JMP, as the criteria for defining coverage here are different to those&#13;
    used in the 2005 Census. The Government of Reconstruction and National Unity is working with co-operation&#13;
    agencies to harmonise the defining criteria of the indicators.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The country has a Drinking Water and Sanitation Policy (ESAPS 2005-2015), currently under revision that will&#13;
    include a separate chapter on sanitation integrated with discussion of the investments required to fulfil the&#13;
    MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The special sanitation policy outlined within plans made by the National Drinking Water and Sanitation Commission&#13;
    (CONAPAS) Executive Secretariat has not been promoted at all.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Weak application of laws and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Lack of human resources and budget for Nicaraguan Institute of Aqueducts and Sewage systems (INAA) and&#13;
    CONAPAS to fulfil their functions.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Need for massive investment to restore existing systems and to extend coverage of sewage and waste water&#13;
    treatment systems.&#13;

3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Excreta disposal, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
The division of functions between institutions states that CONAPAS is in charge of governance; INAA regula-&#13;
tion; the Nicaraguan water and sewerage company ENACAL is the urban service provider; and the social fund&#13;
FISE is the rural service provider. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARE-&#13;
NA) is in charge of regulating discharges of domestic waste water, while the Health Ministry (MINSA) carries out&#13;
epidemiological monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
    1. Lack of in depth attention to sanitation in the rural and periurban sectors.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Municipal authorities have not assumed an active role in the development or sustainability of&#13;
       sanitation services and disposal of excreta.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Platforms for coordination between stakeholders&#13;
Under Presidential Agreement 71-2003, boards have been created for coordination in the sector with members&#13;
from the government, international cooperation and civil society.&#13;

&#13;
               Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
               1. The legally designated institutions do not carry out their functions efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Application of the national General Water Law requires revision and adaptation of the existing&#13;
                   institutional framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country.&#13;
&#13;
            MINSA is responsible for hygiene promotion and sanitation education. Campaigns have been aimed toward&#13;
            the prevention of cyclical illnesses (dengue, malaria) and to vaccination more than any other elements. The&#13;
            former have had very little impact in promoting a hygiene culture amongst the population; the latter have had&#13;
            an impact in and improved culture of prevention and vaccination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                         population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
No policies have been developed for: subsidies, cost recovery or tariffs for hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
education and the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge. Investment subsidies are&#13;
available for the disposal of excreta through latrine programmes. INAA tariff policies are applied for waste water&#13;
treatment, while tariffs are set by municipal authorities for the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of&#13;
solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial monitoring mechanisms have been established by Central Government through the National System&#13;
of Public Investment and the Integrated Financial Management System (SIGFA).&#13;

     Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
     1. The drinking water and sanitation sector must define the sanitation concept in order to establish a&#13;
         sanitation strategy.&#13;
&#13;
     2. The new drinking water and sanitation sector strategy currently under review must propose and&#13;
         estimate sanitation funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                              147&#13;
&amp;#12;            5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
Nicaragua&#13;
            National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Physical coverage alone is used as a national indicator. Data systems exist, but improvements are&#13;
              needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
             1. National sanitation indicators only consider coverage and infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
             2. There are no methodologies in place for verification of the sanitation programme impact on health,&#13;
                except for infant health programmes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
            National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
            There is awareness in the sector of the need&#13;
            to improve training in order to promote hygiene&#13;
                                                                   Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
            promotion    in   sanitation   projects.   Hygiene&#13;
                                                                   1. There are insufficient sanitation-related units and&#13;
            promotion is not the only important element to&#13;
                                                                      training programmes.&#13;
            consider achieving the MDGs; other sanitation&#13;
            and related issues are also required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
            The country has the necessary technology and organisations for implementing improved latrine systems.&#13;
            Greater institutional capacity is needed in urban areas for the execution of projects. It is necessary to&#13;
            explore new innovatory low-cost technologies, like improved latrines, condominium and sewerage&#13;
            systems, wetlands, etc.&#13;
&#13;

Successful experience: Clean Municipality: Healthy Lake Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River are one of the most valuable water resources in the country, and the&#13;
36 municipal authorities in the water catchment area formed the Association of Municipal Authorities of the&#13;
San Juan River (AMUCRISANJ) in order to improve the sanitation conditions of the constituent municipal areas&#13;
in the San Juan basin. AMUCRISANJ has developed a sanitation competition between municipal authorities,&#13;
where a panel of judges evaluates proposals and the application of sanitation actions. The competition has&#13;
been held for the past four years, with municipal authorities highlighting the issue of solid waste disposal each&#13;
time. The Mayoral Offices have evaluated the performance of public service units, their collection capacity,&#13;
treatment, identification of weaknesses and proposals for improvement of their systems.&#13;
&#13;
This competition has allowed the mayoral offices to carry out sanitation interventions increasing numbers of&#13;
security staff, identifying clandestine dumps, relocating unauthorised dumps and holding awareness-raising&#13;
campaigns amongst the local population.&#13;
&#13;
These actions have prompted commitments from most local governments to protect the water catchment area&#13;
and Lake Nicaragua, and has encouraged the Mayoral Offices to keep promoting sanitation actions.&#13;

&#13;
Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Water coverage from piped water supply is available to 88.2% of people; 60.9% in urban zones and 27.3% in&#13;
    rural areas. There is average adequate excreta disposal coverage of 49.5%, 61.3% in the urban area and 30.3%&#13;
    in the rural area. The MDG goal for basic sanitation coverage is 75.3% for 2015, 80.7% in urban areas and 65.2%&#13;
    in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Amongst the 49.5% of the population with sanitation coverage, 29.9% have infrastructure in place for the&#13;
    treatment of domestic effluent, 23% are collected to a septic tank and 46.2% use latrines. The limited coverage&#13;
    of sanitation and drainage systems in urban areas encourage the proliferation of septic tanks, which are&#13;
    inadequately maintained and operated.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Collection services are available to 46.8% of homes in Panama. Amongst the urban population, collection is&#13;
    available to 83.3%, in the rural sector this is 24.5% and 15% amongst indigenous peoples. The MDG goal is to&#13;
    increase collection to 73.4% throughout the population.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Some 19.3% of budget investments for the health sector come from external resources budgeted specifically&#13;
    by the Ministry of Health to deal with three important projects: Sanitation in Panama City and the Bay; the&#13;
    Multiphase Programme for Transformation of the Health Sector I; and a new loan operation to deal with the water&#13;
    and sanitation issue in poor communities throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of the Presidency implements highly relevant projects which aim to improve the quality of life of&#13;
    Panamanian citizens living in poverty and extreme poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Lack of policies allowing for the consideration of particular regional and local characteristics in the process of&#13;
    planning for national development in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Overlap in activities between public institutions responsible for national policy in the sector.&#13;

3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
The Health Ministry, in its role as sanitation authority, has stated that it main aim will be to improve the level&#13;
of health in the country by strengthening the Primary Care Strategy. It aims to offer the population equitable&#13;
and universal access to programmes, projects and services for health promotion, prevention, recovery and&#13;
rehabilitation; with the main beneficiaries being families supported by the Social Promotion Services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
     1. Technicians in the sector need to apply an increased intercultural perspective, providing sanitation&#13;
          education amongst indigenous populations.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Lack of sustainable programmes for sanitation education in areas of poverty and extreme poverty.&#13;

          Policies have been developed for subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for hygiene promotion and sanitation,&#13;
          education; the disposal of excreta and the treatment of waste waters. These types of policies have are not&#13;
          foreseen for the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
               Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
               1. Lack of financial decision-making involving the operational level of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
               2. Lack of direct planning of prevention measures for environmental risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
          National indicators used in sanitation are: the percentage of coverage of the sanitation service; malnutrition&#13;
          - the prevalence of diarrhoea in children aged under five-years-old; and water borne diseases. Sanitation&#13;
          service coverage is broken down into services connected connections to sewage systems, latrines or those&#13;
          connected to septic tanks.&#13;
&#13;
          Data is compiled through water quality monitoring programs in urban and rural areas of the country (ASEP and&#13;
          MINSA respectively) and it is possible to calculate the incidence of diarrhoea and developments in the physical&#13;
          and chemical characteristics of water sources.&#13;

                                                                        a local and regional level.&#13;
staff capable of driving development in the country forward&#13;
with a view to achieving the MDGs. However, there is very&#13;
little funding available in the health sector, especially in rural and indigenous areas. Although the technologies&#13;
needed for achieving the MDGs are available the fact that funds are assigned by sector means they may not&#13;
be used, and fulfilment of the MDGs is therefore not guaranteed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

      reduction through increased sanitation coverage.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Creation of programmes that directly fund the prevention of environmental risk.&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Creation of an information system providing a platform for the statistical analysis and monitoring of&#13;
      environmental tendencies in sanitation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Acquire equipment (transport) and mathematical models to form part of a technical toolkit for monitoring&#13;
      sanitation activities.&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Encourage the recruitment of suitable staff in sector institutions in order to increase the efficiency of their&#13;
      problem-solving capacity.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Increase training programmes to benefit sanitation staff at local and regional levels.&#13;
                                                                                                                        157&#13;
&amp;#12;Panama    Successful experience: Treatment of waste waters in the Bay of Panama&#13;
          The Panama Bay Sanitation Project aimed to develop waste water collection and treatment systems in&#13;
          the city of Panama in order to eliminate the health risks of water borne diseases. As they have progressed&#13;
          through the various phases of building waste water treatment collectors and plants, the indicators for&#13;
          sanitation service coverage have increased, as have the disposal of excreta and treatment of domestic&#13;
          waste waters. By the time the project is completed, sanitation coverage will have increased from 21.3%&#13;
          to 60.7%.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There is 74.8% coverage for the adequate disposal of excreta. Some 20% of the urban population have access&#13;
    to sanitation drainage systems and 66% have access to some form of improved excreta disposal system. Around&#13;
    60% of the rural population have some form of improved excreta disposal.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The target for basic sanitation coverage set by the MDGs is 69% in 2015, which has already been exceeded.&#13;
    National targets set in the anti poverty programme (ELP) aim to achieve 76.7% on average for the same year with&#13;
    70% coverage for sewerage in urban areas and 86% improved sanitation in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Infrastructure for the treatment of domestic effluent provides 15% of the population with access to sanitation and&#13;
    drainage, but there is no national target in terms of waste water treatment.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Coverage of urban solid waste collection is 57%; but only 28.3% have adequate disposal. The national target is&#13;
    to achieve 90% for both collection and sanitary disposal.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 National health policies and hygiene promotion campaigns have been initiated through programmes under the&#13;
    Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education, which have contributed to improvements in the sanitation situation,&#13;
    mainly in rural areas. UNICEF is working on water and sanitation programmes for indigenous communities and&#13;
    vulnerable groups with a hygiene promotion and health component. The ELP is one of the main government&#13;
    strategies and contains targets for basic water and sanitation that are especially directed at poor rural communities&#13;
    and indigenous populations. Some US$ 747.7 million of investments will be needed over the next eight years to&#13;
    complete these.&#13;

&amp;#12;           2. Main critical aspects&#13;
Paraguay&#13;
           Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Weakness in institutional capacities, both national and local, inefficient management of services.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Lack of inter-agency coordination between the various stakeholders (sanitation providers ESSAP and&#13;
             SENASA, ministries, State offices, municipal authorities, governances, NGOs etc.) in systems building and&#13;
             maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 The legal framework is still inefficient in the regulation and control of sanitation service quality, especially in&#13;
             areas with no access to sewerage systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Poor level of citizen demand for their rights, low public participation in decision-making, and monitoring of&#13;
             public sector actions due to a lack of access to information and organisational capacity.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Lack of definition of a unified funding policy. This should provide secure and permanent sourcing including&#13;
             State subsidies for socially equitable development in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Failure to apply appropriate low-cost technologies that would permit better access to sanitation services&#13;
             amongst poorer populations, especially amongst indigenous groups and in marginal urban areas.&#13;
&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Environmental health and basic sanitation are important aspects of the health promotion policy 2006-2010&#13;
  that is also included in the ELP. There are sector policies and strategies on hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
  education and the disposal of excreta. Meanwhile, those relating to: the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
  disposal of sewage sludge; water treatment; and the collection, treatment and disposal of solid waste; are&#13;
  still in the development process.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The ELP sets targets for the water and sanitation sectors. The Department of the National Strategy to Fight&#13;
  Poverty (DIPLANP) was created to coordinate&#13;
  design of the plan, the strategy and interaction&#13;
  activities between institutions responsible for        Critical aspects of sanitation policies and&#13;
                                                         strategies&#13;
  executing   programs.    DIPLANP     coordinates&#13;
  the actions of various government and non-             1. Lack of inter-agency coordination on&#13;
&#13;
  governmental institutions. This includes work             implementing policies. There is a lack of&#13;
&#13;
  with the National Service of Environmental                institutional capacity in interpreting and&#13;
&#13;
  Sanitation (SENASA) on a programme funded                 developing policies and strategies, especially at&#13;
&#13;
  by the European Union focussing investments               local government level.&#13;
&#13;
  and promoting access to basic sanitation               2. There are very few viably funded programmes&#13;
  services in 64 districts with similar degrees of          and projects based on national strategies. Most&#13;

                               Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
                               1. There is a legal vacuum on the disposal of excreta in cases of individual sanitation solutions as&#13;
                                     regulations only exist for the use of conventional sewerage systems.&#13;
&#13;
                               2. There are no strategies in place for the creation of laws and regulations to gradually phase in quality&#13;
                                     levels demanded of sanitation dependent on geographical aspects and implementation schedules.&#13;

&#13;
                      3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
                      There is no governing entity in the sector. There is a drinking water and sewerage service regulatory body,&#13;
                      ERSSAN, but its remit only covers conventional sewage systems. SENASA is responsible for the promotion&#13;
                      and construction of drinking water and sanitation systems in towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants, where&#13;
                      Sanitation Councils are responsible for operations and maintenance. Services are provided by a range of&#13;
                      suppliers including the national sanitation service ESSAP, Sanitation Councils, neighbourhood committees,&#13;
                      binational entities, municipal authorities and governances. SEAM is the national environmental authority. The&#13;
                      national environmental health department DIGESA is responsible for implementing the environmental health&#13;
                      policy and also administers water quality control and monitoring.&#13;

&#13;
            Subsidy policies, cost recovery and tariffs have been developed for: health promotion and sanitation education;&#13;
            the disposal of excreta and the treatment of waste water. Meanwhile, these types of policies have not been&#13;
            foreseen for the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Some mechanisms are implemented by ESSAP and SENASA, mainly linked to the international credit&#13;
            received.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
              1. Sector institutions have no individual capacity for funding works; the State is in charge of funding&#13;
                   investments through grants, credits and international aid.&#13;
&#13;
              2. The private sector has not provided alternative funding for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     164&#13;
&amp;#12;5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
                                                                                                                      Paraguay&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
National indicators used in sanitation are: percentage of coverage of sanitation; malnutrition; prevalence of&#13;
diarrhoea and water borne diseases. The information collected by the Department of Biostatistics of the&#13;
Ministry of Public Health cannot be considered acceptable indicators due to existing levels of under reporting.&#13;
There are no operational information systems in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
Sanitation is beginning to be introduced as an analytical tool in new programmes, although no results have&#13;
yet been produced. DIGESA could play an important role by establishing monitoring and evaluation of human&#13;
health linked to sanitation in their monitoring programmes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
   1. Under reporting on a departmental and area basis (rural and urban) makes data interpretation&#13;
      difficult and prevents the formation of links with variables related to sanitation coverage and the&#13;
      consequences.&#13;
&#13;
   2. There is no monitoring of improvements in sanitation systems after drinking water systems are&#13;
      devolved to Sanitation Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
There are enough adequately trained staff to achieve the MDGs. However, they are not used fully by national&#13;
or local institutions. At a national level, the best trained members of staff are not in positions where they can&#13;
generate change. At a local level, there is poor availability of staff heavy investment in training and greater job&#13;
security are required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
The technologies needed to achieve in the MDGs and national targets are available. Universities have advanced&#13;
programmes in these technologies and in hygiene promotion and sanitation education. Stable technical bodies&#13;
must be created at local level and given strong support for institutional development in order to move sector&#13;
policies and strategies forward - especially in municipal authorities and Sanitation Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
   1. The lack of coordination between public institutions and universities means much of the capacity&#13;
      present in the country is not adequately used.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Municipal authority posts can only be held for five years - this limits effective training as there is no&#13;
      staff continuity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                      165&#13;
&amp;#12;Paraguay   Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           1. Policies and strategies&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Create a legal governing body for the sanitation sector.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 The policies and strategies must be implemented by national laws and regulations drawn up jointly&#13;
                between the governing entity, the government planning office (STP) and other entities involved in the&#13;
                sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           2. Legal Framework&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Approve a law on solid waste.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Fill the legal vacuum on the regulation of in situ disposal of domestic effluent and make regulations on&#13;
                 the tipping of liquid effluent into bodies of water more flexible, allowing for the gradual installation of&#13;
                treatment plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
                domestic waste water&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Establish an institution responsible for coordinating hygiene promotion actions, sewage sludge&#13;
                management and the treatment of waste water.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Define the Central Government institution responsible for providing assistance to municipal authorities&#13;
                in order to empower their participation in sector policies and strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Define a governing entity for the management of solid waste.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Define a Central Government institution responsible for providing technical and financial assistance to&#13;
                municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           4. Funding&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Create medium and long-term funding schemes through the use of local resources (bonds, grants etc)&#13;
                as a sustainability tool for sanitation investments.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Incorporate incentives for private sector participation in sanitation works. Adapt the regulatory framework&#13;
                in order to create an inter-municipal financial vehicle with both public and private participation that will&#13;
                encourage investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Implement a coordinated information system between institutions responsible for monitoring sanitation&#13;
                programmes and develop indicators.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Incorporate DIGESA and the universities in monitoring and evaluation tasks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           6. Capacities&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Generate strategic alliances with local universities to promote technological development in the	&#13;
                sanitation area.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Strengthen the capacity of local people and sanitation councils in order for them to intercede more&#13;
                directly in local action like the municipal budget for sanitation and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                         Paraguay&#13;
Successful experience: Private participation in sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Private companies providing the collection, transportation and final treatment of waste waters and soak&#13;
aways are equipped with the tools they need for collection, transportation and treatment of the effluent.	&#13;
At present they mainly work in urban areas where population density and problems with soil absorption&#13;
mean the ground does not have sufficient capacity for infiltration. This private sector initiative can be&#13;
extended and improved to cover the collection, transportation and treatment of sewage sludge. At least&#13;
two of these companies already have the approval of the Ministry of the Environment.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2004, there was 57% national coverage of sewerage and other forms of excreta disposal. This coverage stood&#13;
    at 68% for the urban sector and 30% for the rural population.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The National Sanitation Plan 2006-2015 aimed to provide 77% of the total population with sewerage or another&#13;
    sanitary form of disposal of excreta â&#128;&#147; a target that would also fulfil the MDGs â&#128;&#147; representing service provision&#13;
    to 24.5 million people, 19.1 million in the urban areas (84% coverage) and 5.4 million in rural zones (60%&#13;
    coverage).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In 2006 more than 75% of waste water generated was not treated before final disposal. It is estimated that only&#13;
    23.7% of waste water collected in urban areas received any type of treatment before being discharged into a&#13;
    receiving body. In Lima, where most of the waste water is generated, the Lima water company SEDEPAL only&#13;
    treats 9.4% of all waste water collected; and the remaining 90.6% is tipped into rivers or directly into the sea. By&#13;
    2015, the national target is to achieve 100% treatment of waste water in urban areas, which means waste water&#13;
    collected from the population served by sewerage systems will also be treated.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Only 75% of solid waste is collected in urban areas by municipal services, while 50% of streets and pavements&#13;
    are cleaned. It is estimated that only 30% of all refuse collected (22% of that generated) is finally disposed of in&#13;
    sanitary landfill.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The sector requires investments of at least US$ 265 million per year if it is to achieve both water and sanitation&#13;
    MDGs. This would include refurbishment works in order to ensure that systems work properly. Similarly, an&#13;
    additional US$ 103 million per year will be needed to achieve 100% waste water treatment in urban zones.&#13;

&amp;#12;         2. Main critical aspects&#13;
Peru&#13;
         Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Low coverage of water, sanitation and waste water treatment services.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Poor quality of service provision.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Low sustainability of systems built.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Tariffs that do not cover the costs of extending and improving services (tariff gap).&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The size of the markets of some service providers does not allow economies of scale, quality professionals&#13;
                  or financial viability.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 There is no effective monitoring and funding for solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Institutional and financial weakness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The sanitation situation is more critical in the rural sector where there are great inequities in coverage due&#13;
                  to restricted access to services.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 International funding that has already been agreed will be used to increase current levels of rural sanitation&#13;
                  coverage through the provision of latrines, avoiding projects with sewerage systems as far as possible.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sector policies and strategies for the safe disposal of excreta are defined in the National Sanitation Plan&#13;
  2006-2015, which establishes the technical, environmental, economic and social actions planned in order&#13;
  to correct the infrastructure deficit.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The general objective of the Sanitation Plan is aligned with the national plan for competivity which aims to&#13;
  provide sustainable improvements to the quality of life of the Peruvian population. The specific objectives&#13;
  include: the promotion of ongoing sanitation education programmes; the execution of works to extend&#13;
  sewerage coverage; the executions of works to extend the coverage of other excreta disposal systems&#13;
  (latrines or others); and waste water treatment works - both public and private.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The policy objectives stated in the Plan aim to contribute to: extended coverage and improved quality and&#13;
  sustainability of sewerage systems; wastewater treatment and disposal of excreta in accordance with the&#13;
  National Plan to Overcome Poverty - one of the main themes of which is for all social programmes or projects&#13;
  to pursue the development of human capacity, where sanitation is one of the main areas of intervention;&#13;
  policy 13 and 21 of the National Agreement signed in 2002; and the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The country also has a National Plan for the Integrated Management of Solid Waste, which identifies&#13;
  investments needed in infrastructure and training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   1. The National Sanitation Plan and the National Plan for the Integrated Management of Solid&#13;
     Waste prioritise the provision of infrastructure and do not clearly establish the importance of the&#13;
     relationship between sanitation, hygiene promotion, sanitation education and its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Support is needed to strengthen service provider and municipal authority policies and strategies in&#13;
     order to allow for the effective decentralisation of services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Peru                   Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
                       1. Absence of definition of the rights and duties of users in service provision and the role of sanitation&#13;
                           education and hygiene promotion in sanitation aspects.&#13;
&#13;
                       2. Lack of specific regulations on some issues related to sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
                  â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Housing and Sanitation (MVCS) is the governing state entity on sanitation service issues through&#13;
                     the National Sanitation Office (DNS). SUNASS is the sanitation services regulatory body in the urban areas.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢	 The Ministry of Health (MINSA) exercises functions in the sanitation aspects of drinking water quality and&#13;
                     environmental health through its environmental health and sanitation departments DIGESA and DESAB.&#13;
                     DIGESA is responsible for standards, supervision, evaluation and authorisation of the use of waste waters and&#13;
                     the tipping of these, and also approves projects for effluent treatment systems. The Regional Health Offices&#13;
                     (DIRESA) act as their regional counterpart. The Ministry of the Economy (MEF) has a special role in aspects of&#13;
                     economic planning in the sector and financial regulation; NGOs and international cooperation agencies play&#13;
                     a role in sanitation service provision, through training, technical advocacy and funding of investments. The&#13;
                     National Fund for Cooperation for Development (FONCODES) also plays a role in the development, execution&#13;
                     and funding of projects in the sector.&#13;
                  â&#128;¢	 Service providers in the urban area are SEDAPAL&#13;
                     in Lima and EPS in the rest of the country. These                                           Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;

                     lation. Sanitation Boards (JASS) provide services                                                and other levels of government, in terms of&#13;

                     specialist operators in 20 locations while others                                                including a lack of accountability and&#13;
                     are served by municipal authorities.                                                             difficulties encountered by SUNASS in&#13;

&#13;
3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
&#13;
Division of main functions between institutions&#13;
Integrated solid waste management is the responsibility of the National Environmental Council (CONAM) which&#13;
is the governing body. Provincial and district municipal authorities are responsible for managing municipal&#13;
solid waste management services. Private enterprises, small businesses, associations of rubbish sorters,&#13;
neighbourhood associations and unions, the public cleaning equipment and implements industry, the recycling&#13;
industry and others are involved in the provision of solid waste collection services through the solid waste&#13;
service providers. DIGESA is in charge of funding.&#13;
&#13;
Regional governments are responsible for promoting environmental health in their regions and for implementing&#13;
the regional environmental management system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Platforms for coordination&#13;
CONAM has assumed an active role in coordinating the various stakeholders, developing actions for exchanges&#13;
of experiences, consultation workshops and training events, and the formulation of working plans.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects of the institutional framework for solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
     1. There is no national governing entity, while institutional weakness is common on a local level due to&#13;
         staff turnover and lack of capacity. This hampers advances and prevents continuity.&#13;
&#13;
     2. There are no national level mechanisms to support agreement on sanitation activities at regional and&#13;
         local levels. The intermediate level of the sector organisational structure has not been developed,&#13;
         meaning district municipal authorities are not linked on local monitoring of services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   173&#13;
&amp;#12;         3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
Peru&#13;
         Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 In rural areas Peruâ&#128;&#153;s National Water and Sanitation Programme (PRONASAR) has incorporated sanitation&#13;
            education and hygiene into each of the projects it is implementing. These aspects are approached before,&#13;
            during and after execution of the works.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 In urban areas, SEDAPAL has developed the coverage extension programme (PAC) for condominium&#13;
            sewage services, with pilot projects including a methodology that incorporates hygiene promotion and&#13;
            sanitation education.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 The Hand-washing initiative is being developed nationally under MINSA leadership with the support of&#13;
            private partners, public partners and civil society. The aim is to improve the health of populations nationwide&#13;
            who are at risk of contracting, diarrhoea - especially children aged less than five-years-old - by acquiring a&#13;
            new hygiene habits like washing their hands with soap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
               1. Successful experiences have not been replicated in the urban and rural ambit meaning the failure&#13;
                   to ensure the sustainability of sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
               2. The social and cultural background of the beneficiary population are not taken into consideration&#13;
                   in the vast majority of sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Since 2006, as part of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Investment Shock framework, the MVCS has been transferring&#13;
         finances to municipal authorities, service providers and regional governments, in order to fund projects with&#13;
         the viability granted by the national public investment office (SNIP).&#13;
&#13;
         Supreme Decree NÂº 021-2007-VIVIENDA on housing has approved requirements for resource allocation for&#13;
         funding in the sector. These requirements aim to seek sustainability in the beneficiary entities receiving the&#13;
         resources.&#13;
&#13;
         Law NÂº 29061, has created the Investment Fund for the Sanitation Sector to channel financial resources&#13;
         from domestic and foreign sources, to service providers (EPS and municipal authorities and the rural sector)&#13;
         operating on the criteria of efficiency, sustainability and choice.&#13;
&#13;
         In the case of the EPS, the tariff schedules are designed to allow the recovery of costs for drinking water&#13;
         services, the disposal of excreta and the treatment of waste water, on the basis of Optimised Master Plans&#13;
         approved by SUNASS.&#13;
&#13;
   174&#13;
&amp;#12;According to the Regulation of the General Law on Sanitation Services family quotas must cover administra-&#13;
tion costs, operation and maintenance of services for small locations and the rural sector.                          Peru&#13;
&#13;
Regulations on the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste state that rates for public servi-&#13;
ces should be paid in the form of a tribute, meaning they must be calculated in relation to the actual cost of&#13;
the service. However, this is not what occurs in practice and municipal revenue is not always spent on the&#13;
same service from which it is raised, being diverted instead to other areas of the municipal budget. There are&#13;
no effective charging mechanisms for public cleaning services, whereby there is a high level of arrears. Simi-&#13;
larly, the few resources available are directed toward refuse collection, with final disposal left untouched.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
   1. MVCS needs to define a financial policy, and to activate INVERSAN as an overall mechanism for&#13;
      resource assignation, allowing for optimal use on the basis of economic efficiency, equity and&#13;
      sustainability of services.&#13;
&#13;
   2. There must be guaranteed sources of funding, mainly foreign and private capital in order to&#13;
      accomplish the goals of the National Sanitation Plan 2006-2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
The most commonly used indicators for monitoring coverage and quality indicators include: continuity of water&#13;
service (number of hours per day); micro measurements (percentage achieved by each EPS); unit production&#13;
(l/inhabitant/day); and services with a disinfection system. Financial indicators are also monitored, including:&#13;
arrears; operational margins of the EPS; active connections; and tariff levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the solid waste sector, although coverage indicators are monitored, municipal authorities do not have the&#13;
capacity needed to produce indicators for operational and technical quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 1994, SUNASS has run a basic technical and economic&#13;
regulation information system for the business sector.                    Critical aspects of sanitation&#13;
                                                                          monitoring and evaluation&#13;
In 2006, the SIAS PERU information system was created                     1. There is no monitoring and&#13;
under the DNS, in order to provide an up-to-date database                    evaluation system for solid waste&#13;
of the main indicators for the sanitation sector. SIAS, which                management or the safe disposal&#13;
is currently being implemented, will consist of a group of                   of excreta and treatment of waste&#13;
processes that compile, develop and distribute information on                waters.&#13;
the water and sanitation sector nationally to be used in sector&#13;
                                                                          2. Implementation of a monitoring&#13;
operations and to support the decision-making processes in&#13;
                                                                             and evaluation system is&#13;
direction and control of the sector.&#13;
                                                                             essential; hence SIAS must be&#13;
                                                                             implemented quickly.&#13;
Another initiative has been undertaken by CONAM in association&#13;
with the National System of Environmental Information (SINIA),&#13;
where on-line information will be entered by non-municipal producers of waste in the form of cargo manifests.&#13;
These companies must also produce a waste management declaration and a management plan each year.&#13;
However, the information collected is of a very limited nature.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   175&#13;
&amp;#12;         Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
Peru&#13;
         Access to sanitation is the indicator used to measuring poverty levels, and these figures provide the basis for&#13;
         the national Poverty Reduction Strategy. These figures are also used for resource assignation and distribution&#13;
         by the municipal fund, FONCOMUN, which is transferred to municipal authorities by National Government,&#13;
         and for the regional fund, FONCOR, with transferrals of funds to regional governments.&#13;
&#13;
         Feeding programs run by MINSA also use access to sanitation in analysis and criteria for formulating goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
         There are very few sanitation specialists. The DNS is working on a Capacity Strengthening Programme to&#13;
         train staff in water supply and sanitation, a scheme which includes research and technical support elements.&#13;
         The National Sanitation Plan also includes the creation of a National Institute to offer technical assistance and&#13;
         training programmes in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
         Universities are able to train professionals in the&#13;
         sanitation field. But there are some serious failings, for    Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
         instance: only a sanitation engineer is legally entitled      1. There is no information on actual numbers&#13;
         to authorise the technical specifications of solid waste         of sanitation professionals, nor are there&#13;
         projects but the university programmes of study do not           any estimates of the number of newly&#13;
         include a single module on the issue.                            trained graduates expected over the&#13;
                                                                          coming years.&#13;
         Some universities run research projects, but these are&#13;
                                                                       2. In the vast majority of cases, the technical&#13;
         seriously limited by budget availability and dependence&#13;
                                                                          solutions implemented are dependent on&#13;
         on funding from international co-operation entities.&#13;
                                                                          techniques proposed by project designers,&#13;
         Some NGOs hold training events, but these are also               with no consultation with or participation&#13;
         severely limited and there are no detailed programme             from the beneficiary population.&#13;
         specifications behind them. Training provided by the&#13;
         professional associations is also of a very limited&#13;
         nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
         There are low-cost, easy operation and maintenance technologies available, including some conventional ideas&#13;
         like individual sanitation disposal systems and collective (condominium) systems. Similarly, the design criteria&#13;
         for reed beds have been exported to other countries in the region, including some linked to the development&#13;
         and promotion of ecological sanitation systems (ECOSAN) and bio filters. The challenge, however, is to develop&#13;
         individual solutions in flood zones.&#13;
&#13;
         SEDAPAL now offers technological alternatives for sanitation systems including condominium sewerage&#13;
         systems for neighbourhoods of Metropolitan Lima. In rural areas, policy is limited to the building of latrines,&#13;
         despite the fact that both regional governments, district governments and FONCODES have been implementing&#13;
         sewerage systems with wastewater treatment plants in rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
         In solid waste, compactor trucks are the most commonly used technology in the country, although they are&#13;
         not entirely appropriate as in most of the waste collected is organic. There is also little capacity for sanitary&#13;
         landfill design.&#13;

&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Establish the relationship between the implementation of hygiene promotion and sanitation education and&#13;
     improved health conditions for the population as part of sector strategy.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Establish the strategy of strengthening sanitation service providers and municipal authorities in order to&#13;
     ensure effective decentralisation of services. This includes developing a financial policy which will introduce&#13;
     incentives for investment sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Revise the Regulations of the General Law on Sanitation Services in order to define user rights and duties&#13;
     in sanitation service provision, as well as the role of sanitation education and hygiene promotion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
     domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Improve coordination and links between the various stakeholders in order to ensure adequate&#13;
     development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Establish support and coordination mechanisms at regional, provincial and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Funding capacity must be strengthened in all sectors involved in monitoring, and environmental cons-&#13;
     ciousness must be fostered in the management of solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Define a clear financial and tariff policy to ensure adequate economic resources to extend sanitation&#13;
     coverage and improve existing services.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Execute an intensive promotion campaign for private sector participation in sanitation service provision,&#13;
     allowing for contributions to the sustainability of investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Make more flexible efforts for the rapid implementation of SIAS.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Create a solid waste management monitoring system within CONAM, establishing mechanisms for&#13;
     coordination and responsibilities at the national, regional, provincial and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 More flexible production of the Programme for Strengthening Capacity in the Sector with the agreement&#13;
     of the various stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Define the technological options to be used, in agreement with the various stakeholders, and with&#13;
     support from international technical cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                       177&#13;
&amp;#12;Peru     Successful experience: Project for Extended Coverage in Lima and Callao&#13;
&#13;
         SEDAPAL has been implementing the PAC since 2003, and US$ 30 million will be spent in the first stage.&#13;
         The project will serve 30,000 houses in settlements in areas of poverty and extreme poverty in the periurban&#13;
         areas of Lima and Callao. The scheme provides technical service feasibility and legal ownership of housing,&#13;
         working alongside neighbourhood organisations that are willing to participate in the scheme and that have&#13;
         been officially recognized by municipal authorities.&#13;
&#13;
         The outcomes include radical changes in the quality of life of the population, providing condominium&#13;
         systems in the place of a total absence of sanitation. Entire household connections and multi-household&#13;
         systems are installed; the population has organised a Water and Sanitation Committee that manages&#13;
         demand for the service; environmental promoters have taken responsibility for monitoring service use and&#13;
         hygiene practices; and local people have been trained in exercising their rights and duties.&#13;
&#13;
         Efficient sewerage systems have also been built with sanitary facilities inside each home. The average cost&#13;
         of the condominium systems is less than half that of a conventional system, and local people take a leading&#13;
         role in implementing the projects, with some guidance, which leads to the effective and healthy use of both&#13;
         interior and exterior installations.&#13;
&#13;
         This project model will have a national impact as it could be replicated by other drinking water and sanitation&#13;
         providers in order to reduce the shortfall in services.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 According to the Suriname Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2006, 92% of the population live in homes&#13;
    with improved sanitation installations. In urban areas, this figure is 98% and in rural coastal areas and the interior,&#13;
    percentages are 91.6% and 33% respectively.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Coverage had reduced slightly in the urban area and increased slightly in rural zones in comparison with&#13;
    MICS 2000. No national objective has been set and the MDGs cannot be achieved infrastructure coverage&#13;
    continues to advance at this rate. In the interior, where basic hygiene practices are at a very limited level and&#13;
    foci of contamination imply greater risks, the main requirement is for better infrastructure coverage coupled with&#13;
    complimentary hygiene promotion.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In terms of environmental policy, the Multiannual Development Plan (MOP) 2001-2005 emphasises the protection,&#13;
    conservation, improvement and rehabilitation of the quality of the environment and sustainable development.&#13;
    Existing environmental legislation, the government entities in charge of implementation and inadequate monitoring&#13;
    mechanisms all limit increased access to improved sanitation. The MDGs on sanitation will probably not be&#13;
    achieved due to the lack of support given to the issue.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Meanwhile, sanitation management has improved significantly in Paramaribo. The Government of Suriname has&#13;
    provided considerable amounts of funding, especially for the maintenance of open sewers. It has calculated&#13;
    investment of US$ 6 million for improved sanitation in urban and coastal areas until 2010.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In the rural area in the interior of the country, the main government strategic advance has been in the community&#13;
    development perspective promoted by the Ministry of Regional Development (MRO) in cooperation with other&#13;
    ministries. The Community Development Fund of Suriname (CDFS) and Interior Development Fund (FOB) have&#13;
    implemented improved sanitation installations in the neediest communities, with total investment of approximately&#13;
    US$ 4 million in 25 projects for drinking water supply and sanitation. Improved sanitation elements have been&#13;
    implemented over the last four years.&#13;

&amp;#12;           2. Main critical aspects&#13;
Suriname&#13;
           Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Most of the institutions in the sector are weak. Many offer services that are not self-sustaining or self-funding,&#13;
                and there is limited allocation of funds. The sewerage system is inadequate and it is managed inefficiently&#13;
                and ineffectively, as responsibilities for sector management are fragmented across several institutions and&#13;
                 departments. There is a lack of qualified staff and no clear legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 In the 1960s a Master Plan for the Sanitation of Paramaribo was drawn up, but only a small number of&#13;
                the planned projects were ever implemented due to a lack of funds. Although studies have been made,&#13;
                 Paramaribo still has no Sewerage Authority.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 In the rural interior of the country, similar institutional problems are compounded by the absence of a&#13;
                solid and co-ordinated rural sanitation program and poor health education â&#128;&#147; elements that form serious&#13;
                limitations.&#13;
&#13;
           Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Technical problems - like inadequate septic tank design that does not allow appropriate removal of solid&#13;
                waste - affects the quality of sanitation services in urban and rural coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 There is a serious lack of appropriate sanitation practices, and the limited availability of installations in rural&#13;
                parts of the interior is equally poor.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 There is clear inequality of access. Access to improved sanitation installations is almost three times lower in&#13;
  the rural interior than in urban and rural coastal areas. The United Nations encountered serious human rights        Suriname&#13;
  violations in indigenous and tribal communities. Children in particular have limited access to basic health&#13;
  services; there are high rates of maternal and infant mortality and malnutrition along with poor sanitation and&#13;
  limited access to drinking water.&#13;

                                                              Critical aspects of sanitation policies and&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The MOP 2006-2010 emphasises the commitments&#13;
                                                              strategies&#13;
  made by Suriname within the MDG framework.&#13;
  Objective 7 especially demands a strategy aimed             1. MOP strategy is not an integrated sanitation&#13;

  energy.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion and health education policies&#13;
  form an integral part of public health preventive policies and educational strategies. Policies on the disposal of&#13;
  excreta constitute a dominant part of poverty reduction strategies, especially for rural areas of the interior.&#13;
  Policies on the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste are linked with&#13;
  environmental protection policies. No policies have yet been developed for the treatment of waste water. None&#13;
  of the policies in the sector form part of the economic development policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Disposal of excreta&#13;
Some aspects are covered by the Law on Ankylostomiasis: Anchylostoomwet (G.B. 1937 No. 23, z.l.g. bij S.B.&#13;
1980 No. 116), on prevention of the development and propagation of ankylostomiasis, through regulations&#13;
for private installations and discharges in rural districts; and Anchylostoombesluit (G.B. 1937 No. 24), that&#13;
regulates application in the sector and establishes quality requirements for building private facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
Some aspects are covered in the Law on Nuisances, which,&#13;
amongst other issues, considers industrial and commercial             Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
waste. Other aspects are covered by Criminal Law, which               1. Existing legislation on health and&#13;
includes resolutions on the tipping of waste in public spa-               environmental matters is vague and&#13;
ces. The Law on Pesticides stipulates the safe elimination of             outdated. There is an urgent need&#13;
unwanted pesticides.                                                      to update the legal framework on&#13;

No specialist regulations have been developed for: hygiene            2. The system of for applying the law must&#13;
promotion and sanitation education; the collection, treatment             be strengthened and reorganised.&#13;
and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge; the control of conta-&#13;
mination in water catchment areas; or for the reuse of human&#13;
excreta, sewage sludge, municipal waste water and solid waste. There is currently a Bill for a Law on Waste&#13;
(Afvalstoffenbesluit) pertaining to these matters.                                                                     183&#13;

                             3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
                             Responsibility for sewage management and the disposal of waste water is shared between the Ministry of&#13;
                             Public Works (MOW) Sewerage and Drainage Division and the Public Health Office (BOG) Environmental Con-&#13;
                             trol Division (MI). The Ministry of Regional Development (MRO) offers logistical support. The MOW mandate&#13;
                             covers the capital. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the management of environmental health, which&#13;
                             includes testing the quality of drinking water and waste disposal (domestic, hospital and industrial). There are&#13;
                             no structural platforms to facilitate coordination between various stakeholders.&#13;

3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country.&#13;
&#13;
The BOG-MVZ leads some programmes in the health and environment sector raising public awareness of&#13;
these issues. NGOs have received training from the PAHO/WASH programme for regular community training.&#13;
The Ministry of Education has included hygiene as an important component in the primary school curriculum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
     1. The sustainable development of existing technology has not been continued.&#13;
&#13;
     2. The hygiene promotion and health education perspective has been applied in schools in the rural&#13;
         interior.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
Policies have not been developed for: subsidies, cost recovery and tariffs for hygiene promotion and sanitation&#13;
education; the disposal of excreta; the collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid&#13;
waste; and the treatment of waste water.&#13;
&#13;
Most sanitation in Suriname is funded by the state budget. Community projects for drinking water supplies and&#13;
sanitation have been funded through CDFS and FOB through loans from donors and subsidies, especially in&#13;
the rural coastal area and the rural interior. There are no financial monitoring mechanisms.&#13;
                                                                                                                                         185&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
                1. Lack of coordination and integration of responsibilities between various institutions, which results in&#13;
                    the inefficient use of staff, unfocused planning of the needed investments, and variable charges for&#13;
                    services.&#13;
&#13;
                2. There is a lack of equitable tariff structures that adhere to the principle of total coverage of costs or&#13;
                    operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              National indicators and information systems&#13;
              for the sector&#13;
                                                                         Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring&#13;
              The MICS form their baseline from the number of            and evaluation&#13;
              improved and non-improved sanitation facilities,&#13;
                                                                         1. There is no information system for the sector.&#13;
              along with the percentage of the population&#13;
                                                                         2. There is a lack of analytical tools for sanitation&#13;
              using sanitary means for the disposal of excreta.&#13;
                                                                            and evidence-based analysis on health,&#13;
              There are no established information systems in&#13;
                                                                            environmental pollution and poverty reduction.&#13;
              the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
              Sanitation information is not used in tools to analyse health improvements, the mitigation of environmental&#13;
              pollution and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              There has been some reflection on existing human resources, but this has been limited to government&#13;
              institutions assuming the main responsibilities in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              The country has access to appropriate technologies needed to achieve the MDGs and national targets.&#13;
              Institutions working on the implementation of sanitation projects in rural areas of the interior have a sustainable&#13;
              technology perspective that includes the promotion of composting toilets. Anton de Kom University is another&#13;
              institution with technological knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     186&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                 Suriname&#13;
  Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
  1. Human resource development is needed, especially in terms of work productivity, efficiency and&#13;
     effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
  2. There is a shortage of human resources in the solid waste sector. There are no career paths offering&#13;
     specific training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop an integrated sanitation policy to include all sectors.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Sector policies must be clearly outlined and links between sectors must be made explicit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Update the national legal framework on sanitation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The system for applying the law must be strengthened and reorganised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
     domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Coordination and integration of responsibilities currently fragmented across various institutions would&#13;
     result in a more efficient use of staff and resources, plans that are better focused on the necessary&#13;
     investment and a more uniform level of service charges.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Delegate more responsibilities and assign greater budgets to the District Commissions, especially in the&#13;
     rural interior and rural coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Improve community participation in Local Government structures. Delegate more responsibilities and&#13;
     assign larger budgets to the District Commissions, especially in the rural interior and rural coastal&#13;
     areas.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Create a national solid waste authority, which has administrative, planning and monitoring autonomy in&#13;
     order to guarantee that national regulations, guidelines and technical standards are implemented on a&#13;
     district level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The coordination and integration of budgets fragmented across various institutions would result in: a&#13;
     more efficient use of staff and resources; planning that is better focused on the necessary investment;&#13;
     and a more uniform level of service charges.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Introduce a tariff structure based on equity and adhering to the principle of total coverage of costs or&#13;
     operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 187&#13;
&amp;#12;           5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
Suriname      â&#128;¢	 Establish an information system.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Develop analytical tools for sanitation and evidence-based analysis on health, environmental&#13;
                   contamination and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           6. Capacities&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Develop human resources for sanitation in the country.&#13;
              â&#128;¢	 Continue with the sustainable development of existing technology on the same scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Successful experience: Baku and sustainable sanitation in the interior of Suriname&#13;
&#13;
           Baku is an isolated CimarrÃ³n settlement, of approximately 7 families. The people live in simple wooden huts,&#13;
           making a living from fishing and local agriculture. The residents live far below the poverty line; they have&#13;
           inadequate sanitation and no basic facilities. The residents deposit their excreta in the open air behind their&#13;
           houses. Under an initiative implemented by the United States Peace Corps, under PAHO guidance, the&#13;
           people of Baku have built seven improved and ventilated pit latrines since 2007. Peace Corps volunteers&#13;
           have collected the money and materials from the people themselves and have also organised the free&#13;
           distribution of materials by local businesses. With a little guidance, a small town in the rural interior can&#13;
           improve its own sanitation conditions, with guaranteed independence from central government, creating a&#13;
           sense of community ownership and increasing sustainability.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
Access to water and sanitation is a fundamental human right established under the Constitution of the Republic,&#13;
whereby a State policy must be enacted to make access universal. There is a high level of coverage by networks&#13;
offering high quality permanent drinking water services and sanitation services in relatively large urban areas. The&#13;
nationâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to the goals set is shown in the willingness to create a new institution to formulate specific&#13;
policy on the issue and the level of capacities developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;
&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strengths: the current coverage provided by the national sanitation company, OSE, in the safe disposal of&#13;
    excreta and the execution capacity provided by their own funds and funding from the World Bank; programmes&#13;
    for the regularisation of settlements in marginal areas; the fact that a governing institution has existed for the sector&#13;
    since 2005 within the Ministry of Housing, Land Registration and Environment (MVOTMA) National Department&#13;
    of Water and Sanitation (DINASA).&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Weaknesses: recent institutional governance; multiple institutions in the sector; recent efforts for inter-agency&#13;
    coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Disparity in coverage of sanitation sewerage system infrastructure between the city of Montevideo and other&#13;
    urban areas of the country.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Great disparity in of sanitation infrastructure between urban or suburban zones of extreme poverty and the&#13;
    remaining urban area.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Reduction of the quality of sanitation services, mainly in the urban interior, due to clandestine rainwater drainage&#13;
    connections to the sewerage system infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation coverage and health and human development indicators&#13;

          1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Montevideo has a public sanitation policy implemented by the departmental government. Even though&#13;
                         there is currently no formal sanitation policy for the country, DINASA was created within MVOTMA in 2005&#13;
                         charged with the task of creating one. Sector policies and strategies have not yet been developed on:&#13;
                         hygiene promotion and sanitation education; the disposal of excreta; the collection, treatment and sanitary&#13;
                         disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and the treatment of waste water.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Links between policies are formed through a transverse coordination policy within the Executive Power;&#13;
                         however, this must be improved and institutionalised.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;   Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies                                                          Uruguay&#13;
   1. Even though there are no explicit sanitation sector policies, documents are being created in a&#13;
      participatory manner within the COASAS forum.&#13;
&#13;
   2. The institutions newly created need to be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Disposal of excreta&#13;
Waters Code (Law 14.859 and amendments), regulates the introduction of substances into water; Decree&#13;
253/79 and modifications establish standards for monitoring of water; and Decree 497/88, regulates the&#13;
discharging of sewage sludge tankers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of sewerage sludge&#13;
(Only applicable in the Department of Montevideo) Montevideo Municipal Council (IMM) Resolution 117/97,&#13;
establishes criteria on the final disposal of industrial sludge and Resolution 162/97, modifies criteria on&#13;
acceptable non-hazardous sludge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Waste water treatment&#13;
Waters Code (sanctioned by Law 14.859 and amendments), regulates the introduction of substances to water;&#13;
Decree 253/79 and amendments, sets monitoring standards for water and industrial effluent; Law 16.466,&#13;
regulates environmental impact evaluation and Decree 349/05 approves the Regulation of Environmental&#13;
Impact Evaluation and Environmental Authorisations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
Law 17.283, on environmental protection; Law 16.466 on evaluation of environmental impact; and Decree&#13;
349/05 approves the Regulation of Environmental Impact Evaluation and Environmental Authorisations; Art.&#13;
402 of Law 17.296, regulates the location of treatment plants and sites for the final disposal of waste; Organic&#13;
Municipal Law establishes competence over the urban solid waste at the departmental level; Decree 135/99,&#13;
regulates solid waste from hospitals; Decree 373/03, regulates the final disposal of used batteries; and Decree&#13;
260/07 regulates the final management and disposal of packaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â»	Monitoring of contamination in water catchment areas&#13;
Waters Code (sanctioned by Law 14.859 and amendments), regulates the introduction of substances to water;&#13;
Decree 253/79 and amendments, sets monitoring standards for water and industrial effluent; Law 16.466,&#13;
regulates environmental impact evaluation; and Decree 349/05 approves the Regulation of Environmental&#13;
Impact Evaluation and Environmental Authorisations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
No specialist regulation has been developed for: hygiene promotion and sanitation education; or for the reuse&#13;
of human excreta, sewage sludge, municipal waste water and solid waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
   1. The regulatory framework for water and sanitation in Uruguay is fragmented and dispersed.&#13;
      It is hard to understand and presents inorganic and unclear regulation.&#13;
&#13;
   2. There is an absence of specific regulations to establish norms and indicators regulated by general&#13;
      standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   193&#13;
&amp;#12;                       3. Institutional framework&#13;
Uruguay&#13;
                       3.1 Disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of domestic waste water&#13;
                       In recent years there has been a tendency to divide functions between service providers, policy-makers&#13;
                       and regulators. In 2005, DINASA was created as an entity responsible for formulating policies on water and&#13;
                       sanitation. In 2002 the Energy and Water Regulation Unit (URSEA) was created as a comptroller and regulator&#13;
                       entity. Service providers continue to be IMM and OSE. The remaining city councils participate through&#13;
                       agreements to extend networks with OSE. Given the early stage of the process, the various functions have&#13;
                       not yet been totally assumed and implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Platforms for coordination between stakeholders.&#13;
                       DINASA is creating openings for coordination between the various stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         Critical aspects of the institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
                         1. Multiplicity of competent institutions on the issue. There is some overlap of functions, leading to&#13;
                            reduced efficiency in the outcome of tasks undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
                         2. OSE provides the sewage system throughout Uruguay except in the Department of Montevideo.&#13;
                            This has led to location-related differences in terms of the criteria employed and levels of service&#13;
                            provided.&#13;

3.3 Hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programmes, institutions and impact of hygiene promotion and sanitation education in the country.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Hygiene promotion programmes are run by IMM, the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES), the Ministry&#13;
   of Public Health (MSP) and MVOTMA.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 There are no indicators to measure the impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Critical aspects in hygiene promotion and sanitation education&#13;
&#13;
   1. The absence of policy leads to a lack of coordination. The situation has improved since MIDES was&#13;
       created in 2005 to act for those in the poor or extremely poor economic brackets.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Existing programs mostly cover issues of hygiene promotion and sanitary education in a subsidiary&#13;
       manner, as these are fundamentally social programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policies have been developed for subsidies, cost recovery and&#13;
tariffs for the disposal of excreta (2); the collection, treatment          Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
and sanitary disposal of sewage sludge and solid waste; and&#13;
                                                                            1. Need for review of the tariff structure.&#13;
the treatment of waste water. This type of policy has not been&#13;
considered for hygiene promotion and sanitation education                   2. Absence of financial provision for&#13;

             5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
             National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Indicators: area covered by sanitation, coverage for each house, number of connections.&#13;
             â&#128;¢	 Information systems: IMM has an information system for the sector.&#13;

             6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
             National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
             No calculation has been made of numbers, although consideration of quality has leading to the conclusion&#13;
             that that there is a deficit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
             The necessary technologies exist and, in many cases, these are known and are being used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
                 1. Deficit of human resources in the sanitation sector, as there is a shortage of trained professionals&#13;
                      compared with demand.&#13;
&#13;
                 2. There is a shortage of staff in the solid waste sector; a situation compounded by the lack of specific&#13;
                      career paths as only generic training is available.&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Formulation of a National Plan for Waters and Sanitation that defines the objectives, goals, activities,&#13;
     timing, stakeholders, priorities, instruments and indicators. This has been developed in a participatory&#13;
     manner with contributions from the various stakeholders.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthening and consolidation of the new institutions created.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Legal Framework&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Formulation of an explicit and adequate regulatory framework fitted to the objectives proposed and the&#13;
     necessary institutionality. This must be proposed by the Executive Power and approved by Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3.1 Hygiene promotion, disposal of excreta, management of sewage sludge and treatment of&#13;
       domestic waste water&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Continue to formalise treatment of sludge and waste water, in accordance with dumping standards.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Incorporate the actions necessary to tackle this issue in a systematic, regulated manner considering&#13;
     continual improvement within the National Plan for Waters and Sanitation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Approve the Bill currently working through the Executive Power on obligatory connection to the sewerage&#13;
     system wherever this passes close to homes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	 3.2 Solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Incorporate solid waste treatment plant management into sector planning, providing adequate final&#13;
     disposal and, wherever possible, reuse for productive ends (a fundamental responsibility of service&#13;
     providers).&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthen departmental governments on the issue of solid urban waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Funding&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Plan necessary resources for the implementation and execution of activities in the coming national budget&#13;
     five-year plans. The Executive Power must assume these activities and Parliament must approve them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Monitoring and evaluation of sector policies by DINASA. The indicators used must be reported and serve&#13;
     as a database, with the cases of the remaining stakeholders pending implementation.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The environmental authority, DINAMA is responsible for monitoring and control of the dumping and final&#13;
     disposal of liquid effluent and solid waste. Specific actions are planned for these aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Strengthening of planning capacities of DINASA, under the Programme for the Modernisation of Public&#13;
     Services and the operational management of OSE, through the Programme for the Modernisation of&#13;
     Management with Funding from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).&#13;

&amp;#12;Uruguay&#13;
          Successful experience: Montevideo Urban Sanitation Plan, Stage III (PSUIII)&#13;
&#13;
          The objective of the programme was to improve the living conditions of the population in the urban area of&#13;
          Montevideo, through increased coverage of the sewerage system and a reduction of both domestic and&#13;
          industrial pollution in the water courses of the city - mainly the Pantanoso, Miguelete and Carrasco.&#13;
&#13;
          The programme had four component parts: (a) institutional strengthening of IMM; (b) solid waste (programme&#13;
          to reduce the tipping of solid waste into the Miguelete and Pantanoso rivers); (c) control of contamination in&#13;
          the Pantanoso and Miguelete; and (d) sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
          The following outcomes of PSU III were selected as indicators:&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Coverage: The works provided sanitation to 140,000 more inhabitants, increasing coverage from 80% to&#13;
            88% of the population.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Resettlement - around 300 households were resettled from risk zones.&#13;
&#13;
          â&#128;¢	 Loads in Montevideo Bay and the Pantanoso and Miguelete rivers: reduction of the loading of contaminants&#13;
            to the watercourses mentioned, reduction from previous levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Notes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          1.	 This refers only to solid urban waste.&#13;
&#13;
          2.	 There are two tariff structures for areas covered by OSE and IMM, respectively, with independent criteria. The OSE tariff structure&#13;
              dates back 40 years and has been distorted and corrected by successive modifications, whereby it is difficult to relate prices&#13;
              to costs for the service provider. The current tariff regime does not provide incentives for efficiency within the company. Existing&#13;
              crossover subsidies are not explicit. The tariff structure for the Department of Montevideo is more recent and simple, although it&#13;
              needs to be fitted to clear and explicit objectives. DINASA still has to develop tariff and subsidy policies as a basic tool to achieve&#13;
              the objectives outlined for the universal access to and efficiency of services.&#13;

Section A: Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In June 2007, coverage for the collection and disposal of waste water was 83.8% in the urban areas and 72.3%&#13;
    for the rural sector. According to public strategies, policies and investment plans for the sector, the goal of 100%&#13;
    coverage will be achieved by 2010. The country has estimated costs of approximately US$ 1.5 billion to meet&#13;
    national targets. The MDGs were met in 2006.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Coverage for the treatment of waste water was 20.2% in June 2007. The Bolivarian Government has prioritised this&#13;
    situation, and in 2006 works (construction of wastewater treatment plants, sanitation of riverbeds and beaches,&#13;
    amongst others) worth an approximate US$ 300 million were undertaken. These and other investments, will&#13;
    contribute to 27% national coverage by the end of 2007. The national target is to achieve coverage of 40% by&#13;
    2010 and 60% by 2015. Investments of US$ 3.621 billion will be required.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is committed to strategic objectives on solid waste as laid out in Chapter 21&#13;
    of Agenda 21 on rational ecological waste management. The Government is especially keen on going beyond the&#13;
    simple elimination or reuse of safe waste products to tackle the root of the problem by changing unsustainable&#13;
    production and consumption patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Main critical aspects&#13;

&#13;
Key critical aspects for fulfilment of the sanitation goals&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Problems in the planning, production and execution of projects, given population dispersal, disorganised&#13;
    settlement growth (suburban and rural), training of infrastructure construction staff, operators and maintenance&#13;
    workers.&#13;

&amp;#12;            â&#128;¢	 The rugged nature of some geographical zones hampers the installation of integrated and efficient&#13;
Venezuela     solutions.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Many municipal authorities do not yet have the staff, infrastructure and equipment required for the efficient&#13;
              management of solid waste collection and disposal.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 Investment planning is not yet adequately coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Inequities in access, quality of service and appropriate use&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 For many years, low income population groups in both urban and rural areas did not receive a waste water&#13;
              collection and disposal system, and where they did, it was a lower quality service. This situation is being&#13;
              overcome through community participation in all areas (urban, rural and indigenous), with investments of&#13;
              US$ 7.6 million in works executed and administered directly by communities that have benefited 200,000&#13;
              people.&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢	 In the matter of solid waste, difficulties in access and the distances between settlements makes it difficult&#13;
              to extend urban sanitation coverage to all the population. Municipal authorities are currently revising&#13;
              management models to open the way for new forms of community participation (community councils,&#13;
              technical boards) and to improve the efficiency of services.&#13;

1. Policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Environmental sanitation is a priority and is one of the strategic goals of the General Economic and Social&#13;
  Development Plan for the Nation (2001-2007). This forms the basis for guarantees of inclusion and universal&#13;
  public services, including the provision of good quality waste water collection, treatment and disposal services&#13;
  for those members of the public who do&#13;
  not yet have these; optimising existing&#13;
  services,   and    promoting           responsible   Critical aspects of sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
  public   participation      in    environmental&#13;
                                                       1. The planning and execution of projects by various&#13;
  management.&#13;
                                                         territorial political entities (ministries, governances,&#13;

  and integral part of strategies for inclusion          coordination between them.&#13;
  and improvements in quality of life.                 2. The cumulative housing shortage generates&#13;

                             Critical aspects of the legal framework&#13;
&#13;
                             1. The dispersed nature of standards hampers regulation by the State. The overlap of national&#13;
                                  competences on governance, service provision and regulation demands extensive project planning&#13;
                                  and execution in order for targets to be met.&#13;
&#13;
                             2. Solid waste regulations are new and they require evaluation and updating. The ordinances dictated&#13;
                                  by the various municipal authorities are assumed as organic laws and they obviate the general&#13;
                                  principles of the legislation on management of activities.&#13;

                         HIDROVEN, a public company owned by the Ministry of the Environment, serves 70% of the population&#13;
                         through nine subsidiary companies. The rest of the population is served by five decentralised companies&#13;
                         with the participation of governances and municipal authorities, by decentralised entities of the governances&#13;
                         and municipal authorities, and by community organised through the Technical Water Boards. The latter are&#13;
                         community-based organisations working on the water issue - they keep the community informed; they serve&#13;
                         as mediators in the event of conflicts, they provide services in some sectors; and they execute works to&#13;
                         extend and improve the service. The functions of governance and regulation are fulfilled through HIDROVEN.&#13;

3.2 Collection, treatment and sanitary disposal of solid waste&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Division of main functions between institutions&#13;
&#13;
The functions of governance and regulation come under the National Public Power, through competent entities&#13;
like the Ministries of Environment and Health. States are obliged to provide technical and financial support for&#13;
the management of municipal authorities, whilst designing and supporting joint plans with the national executive&#13;
and local governments for special purposes (contingencies, emergencies and natural disasters). The municipal&#13;
authority is responsible for protection of the environment and co-operation in environmental sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MINAMB is the governing entity on the matter. There is a refuse and waste management section under the&#13;
General Department for Environmental Quality, which sets all guidelines and strategies on this matter. There is&#13;
also a Solid Waste Execution Unit responsible for building sanitary landfills on a national level and the sanitation&#13;
of solid waste dumps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Platforms for coordination&#13;
&#13;
MINAMB has staff employed in the regions to supervise solid waste projects. Coordination mechanisms exist&#13;
in community councils and Mayorsâ&#128;&#153; offices. There is a Technical Commission in Caracas made up of all entities&#13;
involved in the urban and domestic sanitation services. Also, the Law on Refuse and Solid Waste establishes&#13;
a National Commission on the issue, with representatives from governing entities including: health and the&#13;
environment, education, representatives of Mayorsâ&#128;&#153; offices and governances, and the private sector.&#13;

&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 Municipal authorities have their own financial control mechanisms on contracts or with services operators&#13;
   for the collection and disposal of solid waste.	                                                               Venezuela&#13;

&#13;
   Critical aspects of sanitation funding&#13;
&#13;
   1. Project formulation and evaluation process is slow in the sector, making it difficult to guarantee&#13;
      optimal decisions in resource allocation.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Staff training and strengthening of the technological platform are critical in achieving efficient&#13;
      investment and expected results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National indicators and information systems for the sector&#13;
&#13;
Coverage is used as the national indicator, as both billing and charging are linked to drinking water services.&#13;
Even though there is no information system for the sanitation sector, certain methodologies provide sufficient&#13;
data for monitoring and integrated evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
HIDROVEN works directly with Barrio Adentro social            Critical aspects of sanitation monitoring and&#13;
health programme and with the dependencies                    evaluation&#13;
responsible for rural development like the Ministry of        1. Capacity to generate, organise and&#13;
Popular Power for Citizen Participation. The National             disseminate statistical information and&#13;
Institute of Statistics (INE) carries out ongoing house-          management indicators is underused in the&#13;
to-house surveys with six monthly results allowing for            sector.&#13;
monitoring of waste water collection, treatment and&#13;
                                                              2. Lack of an information system complicates&#13;
disposal.&#13;
                                                                  the monitoring and evaluation of behaviour&#13;
                                                                  in waste water collection, treatment and&#13;
Sanitation within the analytical tools&#13;
                                                                  disposal services on a national level.&#13;
The data obtained in the sector are sometimes&#13;
considered in drawing up analytical tools to improve&#13;
health, mitigate environmental pollution and reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6. Capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
National reflection on human resources to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
The Bolivarian Government considers it is important to strengthen public management in order to obtain&#13;
results. The government priority on the sector can be seen in: educational programmes for environmental&#13;
engineering and other related issues at university level; revised university programmes for postgraduate&#13;
degrees in the management of rural aqueducts; educational programmes implemented by HIDROVEN on a&#13;
national scale (the training of operators etc); the Environmental Education Programme â&#128;&#152;Water in Our Lives,â&#128;&#153;&#13;
with support from the Ministry of Education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technologies needed to achieve the MDGs/national targets&#13;
&#13;
The Government has moved forward on science and technology in order to strengthen the way this is&#13;
managed. The sector has been reviewing the technologies on offer to be used in new investment projects that&#13;
could increase service coverage and improve sanitation on a national level.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  207&#13;
&amp;#12;Venezuela&#13;
&#13;
                Critical aspects of capacity in the sector&#13;
&#13;
                1. Staff training is needed in specific areas such as the collection, treatment and disposal of waste&#13;
                   waters, including the reuse of sewage sludge.&#13;
&#13;
                2. There must be analysis and adaptation of new technologies to the features of each region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Section C: Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            1. Policies and strategies&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Creation of the Central Planning Commission â&#128;&#147; to establish precise and integrated planning for all eco-&#13;
                 nomic, social and political factors in the country - will allow for coordination and more ordered invest-&#13;
                 ment of resources in the sector.&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 The solid waste sector must be maintained as a specific item for investment, in order to guarantee&#13;
                 continued progress through time and to deepen educational aspects in order to achieve changes to&#13;
                 unsustainable production and consumption patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            2. Legal Framework&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 The new legal framework is currently being implemented.&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 There is a need for review and strengthened application of the legal framework to include the extended&#13;
                 responsibility of producers and measures to discourage the use of non-reusable or disposable&#13;
                 packaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            3. Institutional framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              3.1 Solid waste management&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Make environmental education programmes more systematic in order to increase valuation of this&#13;
                 service and contribute to its sustainability by providing payment.&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Move forward on aspects of inter-agency coordination in order to improve refuse and solid waste&#13;
                 management nationally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            4. Funding&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Strengthen sector planning and investment systems and involve the competent entities at all territorial&#13;
                 political levels. This will make public investment more efficient and the outcomes are more likely to	&#13;
                 have the expected results amongst the public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            5. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 There is an overwhelming need for review and updating of methodology and procedures for the&#13;
                 monitoring and evaluation of environmental sanitation.&#13;
               â&#128;¢	 Well designed information systems will provide for evaluation of resource investment, the effectiveness&#13;
                 of these and their impact on the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     208&#13;
&amp;#12;6. Capacities&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Strengthened plans and programmes for the training of officials, community leaders and individuals                        Venezuela&#13;
       involved in the areas analysed contributes to improved environmental sanitation management.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Capacities must be strengthened in official entities, above all in the matter of planning, management&#13;
       by results, information systems management and the design and evaluation of impact indicators and&#13;
       results. Citizen education on hygiene and environmental sanitation is a priority for the Government.&#13;

Successful experience: Waste water networks in the MarÃ­a ConcepciÃ³n Palacios Neighbourhood&#13;
&#13;
The MarÃ­a ConcepciÃ³n Palacios neighbourhood, in southern Maracaibo, Manuel Dagnino Parish, has a&#13;
population of approximately 200 families (1,400 inhabitants) who are poor but responsible. For many years,&#13;
the waste water flowed from their homes directly into the streets or across neighbouring pavements. In&#13;
order to deal with the resulting serious hygiene and health problem, they decided to build the wastewater&#13;
collectors and network they needed. These works, at an estimated cost of US$ 100,000, had been put&#13;
on hold for many years by various entities at different levels of territorial politics, due to: a lack of financial&#13;
resources; the difficulties inherent in digging pipelines across the main motorway of Maracaibo; and the&#13;
refusal of the 700 families in the neighbouring community of Santa Clara to allow the waste to cross their&#13;
property. The Santa Clara residents would not allow the waste water to be channelled into the network that&#13;
discharged in the main collector within their jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
After 22 months of mediation, the National Guard, the Police of Maracaibo, the Public Prosecutor, the&#13;
Environmental Prosecutor and the State service provider Hidrolago were assembled. An agreement was&#13;
reached and the community proceeded to execute the works directly through the Technical Water Board.&#13;
The 20-year conflict between the two communities was finally resolved and joint approaches adopted to&#13;
problems of hygiene and health, sanitation and environmental education.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the second edition of a report
            on the issues, coverage, statistics and recommendations
            relating to sanitation in Latin America. This report will
            feed interest in the region&#146;s sanitation situation by
            providing updated versions of the country reports presented
            in the first edition and by including the Jamaican report
            missing from the previous edition. Today, as the second
            anniversary of LATINOSAN 2007 approaches, we believe
            advances have been made: in fact, the first outcome of
            LATINOSAN was the signing of the Cali declaration, where 16
            Latin American countries made a commitment to give political
            priority to the sanitation issue. The basis of these
            commitments lies in three concrete actions: i) prioritizing
            sanitation in national development policies; ii) support for
            the main objectives of the International Year of Sanitation;
            and iii) strengthening intergovernmental cooperation in the region.
