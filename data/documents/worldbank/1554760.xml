FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report. The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They  include  several  country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.      The&#13;
papers   are  the   work   of   individuals  and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This study seeks to answer two questions. Are there&#13;
developing countries in which the decline in fertility was rapid but&#13;
then decelerated greatly or stopped altogether for a period of at least&#13;
five years at a level well above replacement? If there are, what are&#13;
the reasons for such a stalling of the decline? The number of&#13;
developing countries is limited in which such a stall has occurred, and&#13;
for which the kind of data, of good quality, needed to answer the second&#13;
question are available.&#13;
In the three countries studied, the total fertility rate began&#13;
a sustained rapid decline during the 1960s. (In Sri Lanka the decline&#13;
may have begun during the 1950s.) In all three the declines began to&#13;
stall around 1975. The Republic of Korea, the only one of the three&#13;
countries studied in which two stalls occurred, experienced an earlier&#13;
stall during the period 1967-72 inclusive. Moreover, while the total&#13;
fertility rate levelled off during the late 1970s in Costa Rica and Sri&#13;
Lanka, it continued to fall in Korea, but at a much slower pace than&#13;
during the previous declines. The stalls of the late 1970s had not&#13;
ended as of 1980-82, the most recent year for which data are available.&#13;
The explanations of the stalls are partial, and they differ&#13;
from one country to the next. In Costa Rica, marital fertility and&#13;
contraceptive use levelled off, apparently as a result of a convergence&#13;
between (1) desired and actual fertility and (2) a weakening of the&#13;
family planning program, as the initial enthusiasm and political support&#13;
waned.&#13;
In Korea, at least some of the reasons for the near levelling&#13;
off of the total fertility rate during the late 1960s seem to be&#13;
evident. But the explanation for the acceleration after 1975 is not.&#13;
During the earlier period, an increase in marriage among women 30-49&#13;
years old, as well as an increase in marital fertility of those under&#13;
age 30, offset declines in marriage among women 15-29 years old and in&#13;
the marital fertility of women age 30-49. The rise in the marital&#13;
fertility of younger women is accounted for by a sharp decrease in the&#13;
first three birth intervals, resulting from increases in premaritally&#13;
conceived first births (associated with a shift from arranged to&#13;
romantic marriages), declines in the duration of breastfeeding, and an&#13;
apparently growing desire to terminate childbearing early. The increase&#13;
in contraceptive use decelerated markedly during the late 1960s.&#13;
During the late 1970s in Korea, the marital fertility of women&#13;
25-29 years old increased a bit, reversing the moderate decline of the&#13;
early 1970s. Among wives 30-34 years old, fertility continued to fall&#13;
during the late 1970s, but at less than half the rate of the early&#13;
1970s. By the late 1970s, childbearing had become so concentrated that&#13;
almost half the total fertility rate was accounted for by the birth rate&#13;
of women aged 25-29, and about two-thirds by women aged 25-34. The&#13;
increase in contraceptive use decelerated during the late 1970s and&#13;
early 1980s (especially the latter period), after the acceleration of&#13;
the early 1970s. But the reasons for these changes have not been&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
The explanation for the fertility stall during the late 1970s&#13;
in Sri Lanka is also quite limiltesd. There was a large increase in&#13;
contraceptive use between 1975 and 1982. At least some of the&#13;
fertility--depressing effect of tlhis increase presumably was offset by an&#13;
increase in marriage, which seems to have begun prior to 1978, when&#13;
economic conditions improved considerably, apparently strengthening the&#13;
rising trend of marriage. There may also have been a reduction in the&#13;
long duration of breastfeeding which had been practiced in Sri Lanka&#13;
(thereby tending to increase fertility), but the evidence is too meager&#13;
for one to be confident that such a decline actually occurred.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
This study seeks to answer two questions. Are there less developed&#13;
countries in which the decline in fertility was rapid but then decelerated&#13;
greatly or stopped completely for a while well above the long-run replacement&#13;
level? If there are, what are the reasons for the stalling of the decline?&#13;
Given the urgency today of reducing fertility rapidly in many developing&#13;
countries (LDCs), the stalling of a rapid decline evokes concern. Knowledge&#13;
of the causes of stalls may help end the stalls that have occurred and reduce&#13;
the risk of their occurrence in countries which have not experienced them.&#13;
Such knowledge is not readily available, partly because stalled fertility has&#13;
become an issue only recently. This study, then, is an early effort to close&#13;
this gap in our knowledge of fertility dynamics.&#13;
Analyses of stalled fertility may proceed by case studies or by&#13;
comparison. It would be desirable to use both approaches. Limited resources,&#13;
however, precluded doing both in this instance. It was decided, therefore, to&#13;
do case studies. The knowledge gained from them, it was felt, may be helpful&#13;
in designing a subsequent comparative analysis. The case studies have been&#13;
done through a synthesis of information provided in the existing literature.&#13;
In dealing with the first question--whether rapid fertility decline&#13;
has stalled in any less developed country--it was necessary to specify an&#13;
operational definition of a "stall." The following criteria were chosen:&#13;
1.   Only those LDCs should be considered in which the total fertility&#13;
rate (TFR), a measure of fertility that, unlike the crude birth rate (CBR) is&#13;
independent of the influence of a population's age-sex structure, fell from a&#13;
high level (TFR &gt; 5.0) by at least 20 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.   The decline should have been rapid, defined as a fall in the TFR&#13;
averaging at least 0.15, preferably 0.20, of a point per year for a period of&#13;
at least five years. Thus, a drop in the TFR averaging 0.2 of a point per&#13;
year for 10 years would reduce the TEE: from, say, an average of 6.5 children&#13;
per woman to 4.5. The analysis of stalled fertility was limited to cases in&#13;
which fertility decline prior to the stall was rapid because the change from&#13;
decline to stall was more abrulpt in such instances than in cases of a slower&#13;
decline, and the greater abruptness of the change, it was assumed, would make&#13;
it easier to detect the reasons for the stall.&#13;
3.   As for the stall itseLf, it was hoped that there would be cases in&#13;
whica a rapid decline was followed by a period of no decline at all. If not,&#13;
cases of substantial deceleration (i.e., a rate of decline no more than half,&#13;
and pDreferably much less, of the rate' during the preceding period1 of rapid&#13;
decline) would be examined. How long should the period of deceleration or&#13;
leveLling off last? There was little on which to base a decision, but it was&#13;
decided to limit, if feasible, the analysis to cases in which the stall lasted&#13;
at least five years (with perhaps four acceptable), even if the stall&#13;
subsequently ended.&#13;
4.   Cases in which the fall in fertility had brought the TFR close to the&#13;
long-run replacement level would be excluded. Depending on the mortality&#13;
leveL, the replacement level of the TFR is likely to be in the range 2.0-&#13;
2.5. At this level, one would normally expect little further decline in&#13;
fertJLlity. Moreover, replacement level fertility is usually the goal of&#13;
efforts to reduce fertility. H[ence, there is more urgency in identifying the&#13;
reasons for a fertility stall in countries with a TFR well above replacement&#13;
than in those where it is at ort close to replacement.&#13;
Applying these criteria, a number of candidates were identified.&#13;
Not all of these were suitable, however, for either the amount, ikind, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
quality of information available to us was too limited. In addition to annual&#13;
data on the trend in fertility (the CBR and the TFR), data were also needed&#13;
regarding marriage patterns, marital fertility, family planning programs,&#13;
family-size desires, and contraceptive use. Additional information about&#13;
abortion and breastfeeding would be quite helpful, but given their scarcity,&#13;
their availability was not made a necessary condition.&#13;
Analytic Framework&#13;
There is no generally accepted theory of fertility dynamics. There&#13;
are, instead, a large number of hypotheses about a variety of ostensible&#13;
determinants. In addition, there are many models or frameworks of fertility&#13;
determinants depicting their relations to each other and to fertility. These&#13;
encompass biological, social, economic, cultural, and psychological factors,&#13;
though usually not all in the same model. This situation makes it difficult&#13;
to decide how to organize a study of fertility change. There has, however,&#13;
come to be increasing acceptance of a scheme that encompasses what are&#13;
regarded as the most important "proximate" determinants (Bongaarts 1983).&#13;
This scheme is based on the process of reproductive physiology, with its&#13;
sequence of conception, gestation, and parturition. Schemes identifying&#13;
classes of factors that influence the degree of exposure to the risk of&#13;
conception, the probability of conception, and the continuation of gestation&#13;
have been developed. Bongaarts (1983) has presented empirical evidence that&#13;
most of the variation in levels of fertility among populations can be&#13;
accounted for by four variables: the proportion married, contraception,&#13;
induced abortion, and postpartum infecundability. ("Fecundability" is defined&#13;
here as the probability of conception.) Aside from a very short period after&#13;
birth during which ovulation does not occur, the main factor reducing the&#13;
probability of conception in the absence of contraception is breastfeeding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
If these four proximate determinants are the most important ones, as&#13;
the available evidence indicates, then other factors must exert their&#13;
infLuence mainly via their impact on them. Thus, once the impact that the&#13;
four major proximate determinants have had on the decline in fes^tility has&#13;
been identified, efforts to measure the influence of such factors as social&#13;
and economic change can be macde by taking social and economic factors as the&#13;
independent variables and the four proximate determinants as the dependent&#13;
variables. No systematic atte!mpt has been made to do this in this study,&#13;
again because of the constrairLts of time and resources. Nevertheless, when&#13;
information has been readily aLvailable about the significant impact of such&#13;
factors, it has been included in this report.&#13;
Thus, the core of the analytic framework used in this study&#13;
consists of the four major proximate determinants. It should be noted,&#13;
however, that since an important determinant of the proportion marrying,&#13;
especially during the early years of a woman's reproductive period, is the age&#13;
at marriage, data on the lattetr are included in the analysis. Also, to help&#13;
assess the infLuence of variations in age at marriage and the proportion&#13;
marrying, marital fertility is compared with the fertility of all women.&#13;
Similarly, because of their presumed close connection with the use of&#13;
contraception and abortion, and their frequent availability in 4fertility&#13;
surveys, data on preferences regarding the number and sex of children and on&#13;
the availability of birth control services and materials have been included.&#13;
FinaLly, in measuring the decline in fertility, data on the CBR, as&#13;
well as the TFIR, have been reported. Though the TFR is analytically a better&#13;
measure of fertility, the CBR is important because of its direct relevance for&#13;
the rate of population growth. The TFR is a better measure because it is not&#13;
influenced by changes in the proportion in the population of women of&#13;
repr-oductive age, whereas the CBR is. Consequently, the CBR may change at a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
different rate than the TFR. When the CBR declines more rapidly than the TFR,&#13;
it implies that the proportion of women of reproductive age has been&#13;
declining. On the other hand, when this proportion increases, the CBR&#13;
declines more slowly than the TFR. The age structure effect on the CBR is&#13;
limited, but within its limits it can and does cause significant changes. It&#13;
is helpful, therefore, to pay attention to the impact of changes in the&#13;
proportion of reproductive-age women in the population, as well as to the&#13;
other factors noted above.&#13;
The three countries chosen for this study are Costa Rica, the&#13;
Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka. They meet the criteria for a stall; the&#13;
quantity and quality of the requisite data about them are reasonably good; and&#13;
they have diverse cultures and social systems. Within the constraint imposed&#13;
by the criterion concerning the pace of decline, there are significant&#13;
variations in the rates of their fertility decline. In sum, they appear to&#13;
offer a good opportunity for a productive exploratory analysis of stalls in&#13;
fertility declines.&#13;
The variations among the three countries in the extent and pace of&#13;
the fertility decline (as measured by the TFR, which is the sum of the&#13;
age-specific birth rates) may be seen in Figure 1. The TFR was much higher&#13;
(over 7 children per woman, on average) in Costa Rica in 1960 than in Korea&#13;
(6.0) and Sri Lanka (5.5). The drop in Costa Rica was swifter than in the&#13;
other two countries, and by the early 1970s the three TFRs differed by less&#13;
than 0.5. By then, the first stall in Korea, which had occurred from 1967&#13;
through 1972 at a TFR of about 4.3, had ended, and another period of rapid&#13;
decline, similar to that of the early 1960s, took place. By 1976, however,&#13;
the pace of that fall had slowed greatly, and a small, gradual decline ensued&#13;
through 1980. In each of Costa Rica and Sri Lanka, however, only one stall&#13;
occurred, beginning about 1974 and lasting through the remainder of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
decade. In Costa Rica, the 1FR stalled at about 3.8, while in Sri Lanka, it&#13;
seems to have done so at about 3.5.&#13;
The trend of the TFR in Sweden during the same period has been&#13;
included in the figure in order to show how great the difference was between&#13;
the fertility of these three countries and that of a low-fertility country.&#13;
The comparison also helps bring out how much the gap between them has been&#13;
narrowed and how much remains.   It should be noted, however, that the Swedish&#13;
TFR fell below the long-run population replacement level by the late 1960s and&#13;
that it continued to fall (even if slowly) during the 1970s. Hence, its level&#13;
in the late 1970s should not be viewed as a feasible target for these three&#13;
developing countries (or any developing country). More realistic would be the&#13;
replacement level, which would be about where Sweden's TFR was during most of&#13;
the 1960s.&#13;

I. Fertility trend&#13;
Fertility fell rapidly from 1960 to the mid 1970s, but then levelled&#13;
off (TFR) or even increased a little (CBR) through    1980 (Table 1).   The CBR&#13;
fell about 40 percent between 1960 and 1973, from 48 per 1,000 to 29-30. It&#13;
remained at 30 through 1976; then it may have risen a bit to 32 by 1980. The&#13;
trend in the TFR was similar, but tlhe decline between 1960 and 1976 was&#13;
somewhat more rapid. It fell by almost 50 percent between 1960 and 1976 from&#13;
7.3 to 3.7. From 1976 through 1980 it fluctuated between 3.7 and 3.9.&#13;
II. Explanation of the trend&#13;
A. Changes in the crude birth rate&#13;
The more rapid decline in the TFR than in the CBR indicates that&#13;
there were changes in the age-sex structure which tended to slow down the fall&#13;
in the CBR. lDuring the early 1960s, the proportion of women aged 15-49 as a&#13;
percentage of the total population is estimated to have been about 21&#13;
percent. By 1975, it is estimated, it rose to 23.5 percent, and by 1981,&#13;
according to the 1981 census data, it was 25.6 percent. Rosero (unpublished&#13;
paper, no date) notes that the change in the age structure from 1960 to 1965&#13;
contributed 18 percent (-1.1/-6.2) to the decline in the CBR that occurred&#13;
then (Table 2). But between 1965 and 1978, the CBR would have declined by&#13;
16.3 points instead of 10.0, reaching a level of 25.8 instead of 32.1, if&#13;
there had been no change in age composition.&#13;

Since the changes in age structure contributed to the fertility&#13;
decline only modestly during the early 1960s and worked against the decline&#13;
thereafter, it follows that the age-specific birth rates must have fallen by a&#13;
large amount--large enough to offset the inflating effect of the increased&#13;
proportion of women of reproductive age and still produce a large drop in the&#13;
crude birth rate.&#13;
During the first half of the 1960s, the age-specific birth rates&#13;
(ASBR) fell much more rapidly among women under age 35 than among women 35 or&#13;
more (Table 3). During the late 1960s, however, older women reduced their&#13;
fertility at a rate about equal to that of younger women. Moreover, whereas&#13;
the TFR dropped by 10 percent between 1960 and 1965, it fell by 25 percent&#13;
during the late 1960s. During the first half of the 1970s, the pace of&#13;
decline continued to increase among older women, but slowed among younger&#13;
ones. Indeed, among teenagers, the ASBRs rose a bit. Finally, the late 1970s&#13;
saw the ASBRs going up (even if only slightly) among women under age 35&#13;
(except for those 20-24), while they continued to fall among women 35 and&#13;
over. The TFR fell almost as rapidly (23 percent) in the period 1970-75 as in&#13;
the preceding five-year period (25 percent). As noted above, however, there&#13;
was virtually no change during the late 1970s.&#13;
Over the two decades, the TFR fell by 49 percent, with the decline&#13;
in the ASBRs varying inversely with age around this average decline. The drop&#13;
among teenagers (12 percent), however, was much smaller than among women over&#13;
age 19. As a result of this pattern of change, births occurred increasingly&#13;
at an early age. Whereas, for instance, one-third of births in 1960 was to&#13;
women under age 25, by 1980 42 percent took place among women of this age.&#13;

B. Changes in the age-specific birth rates&#13;
These changes are determined by changes in the average age at&#13;
marriage or union and in marital fertility. Annual rates of nuptiality fell&#13;
considerably during most of the 1960s, but then the trend reversed itself&#13;
beginning late in the decade. Teenagers apparently postponed marriage during&#13;
the 1960s, but married at an older age during the 1970s. As a result, changes&#13;
in nuptiality contributed 18 percent (-1.1/-6.2) to the decline in the CBR&#13;
from 1960 to 1965 (Table 2). Between 1965 and 1978, however, if there had&#13;
been no change in nuptiality, the CBR would have fallen by 11 points instead&#13;
of 10. Obviously, nuptiality changes have had little effect on the decline in&#13;
the CBR and (by implication) on the TFR in the later period.&#13;
Similarly, the data from the 1976 National Fertility Survey (NFS)&#13;
indicate little change in the median age at first union (World Fertility&#13;
Survey, 1980). It was 20.8 for the period 1955-65 and 21.0 for 1966-76. The&#13;
1976 survey data on median age at first union by current age of the&#13;
respondents are:&#13;
Year when            Median age&#13;
Current age        age 20-24         at first union&#13;
25-29              1971                 21.7&#13;
30-34              1966                21.2&#13;
35-39              1961                 21.0&#13;
40-44              1956                 21.1&#13;
45-49              1951                 21.7&#13;
These data are consistent with the Increase in fertility during the&#13;
1950s followed by the decline during the 1960s.&#13;
The factor that was overwhelmingly responsible for the decline in&#13;
fertility was the drop in marital fertility, resulting from a rapid increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
in the use of contraception, particularly the newly introduced, more efficient&#13;
methods. Let us look first at the! fall in marital fertility.&#13;
Stycos (1978) notes that of the 30 percent drop in the general&#13;
fertility rate between 1965 and 1972, the period during which fertility&#13;
declined most rapidly, 87 percent resulted from the fall in the fertility of&#13;
lesgally married women, and 44 percent of this was to women in their late&#13;
1920s. He concludes that "the fertility decline in Costa Rica was initiated,&#13;
and to a considerable extent, realized, by young married women" (Stycos,&#13;
1978:20).&#13;
During the late '1J70s, however, marital fertility levelled off.&#13;
Rosero (1981:36) presents data on the total fertility rate of ever-married&#13;
women from the 1976 NFS (referring to 1974-75) and the 1981 CPS (referring to&#13;
1979-80):&#13;
TFR&#13;
NFS 1976                CPS 1981&#13;
(1974-75)               (1979-80)&#13;
All women                 3.5                    3.6&#13;
Ever-married women        3.9                    3.8&#13;
The differences of 0.1 between the 1976 and the 1981 data could be&#13;
accounted for by sampling or other error; hence, they should not be regarded&#13;
as a real change.&#13;
According to vital statistics data, the level of the TFR for all&#13;
women was essentially the same at both dates, 3.8 in 1975 and 3.7 in 1980.&#13;
Though the survey TFRs are lower, tlhey confirm the levelling off during the&#13;
late 1970s indicated by the vital statistics data. That marital fertility, as&#13;
well as the rfertility of all women, was level indicates that the levelling off&#13;
of the TFR was not influenced by changes in nuptiality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
C. Changes in marital fertility&#13;
These changes may be explained by changes in family size&#13;
preferences; knowledge of contraceptive methods; acceptability of family&#13;
planning; breastfeeding; and use of contraception, abortion, or sterilization.&#13;
Multivariate analysis of CPS 81 data regarding the use of&#13;
contraception found it related weakly to socioeconomic status (residence,&#13;
class, education) or accessibility of contraceptives (because sources of&#13;
supply are almost always nearby). The factors that were most strongly related&#13;
were reproductive preferences and intentions, the acceptability of family&#13;
planning, and the knowledge of contraceptive methods (Rosero 1981:87). We&#13;
look first at preferences.&#13;
1. Family size preferences&#13;
Prior to the 1976 NFS, data on preferences were collected in a 1964&#13;
survey of women aged 20-50 living in the urban portion of the Metropolitan&#13;
Area of San Jose (Costa Rica's capital and largest city) and in a 1969 survey&#13;
of women aged 15-49 living in rural and semi-urban places (i.e., cities and&#13;
towns with less than 20,000 inhabitants) of the country (Rosero, et al., no&#13;
date:17). Comparing each of these two sets of data with the comparable data&#13;
from the 1976 survey, the striking finding is that little change seems to have&#13;
occurred. The mean number of children desired by urban women in unions was&#13;
4.1 in 1964 and 3.9 in 1976. Similarly, the analagous figures from the&#13;
"rural" surveys were 4.9 in 1964 and 4.7 in 1976 (Rosero, et al., n.d.:47).&#13;
If the 1976 and the earlier data were perfectly comparable, they&#13;
would indicate a slight decline. If error and noncomparability tended to&#13;
inflate the 1976 data relative to those collected in the 1960s, they would be&#13;
underestimating the decline. But for all we know, there may have been an&#13;
opposite bias, tending to exaggerate the apparent decline. In the latter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
case, if the bias were more than moderate, there would have be!en an increase&#13;
rather than a decrease in the number of children preferred, wh,ich seems&#13;
unlikely. It follows that, unless there was a large bias tending to reduce&#13;
the apparent decline, the available data show several notable things: (1) the&#13;
desired family size seems to have been between four and five during the late&#13;
1960s; (2) it: was apparently higher in rural than in urban areas, but by&#13;
perhaps no more than 20-25 percent; and (3) little, if any, decline between&#13;
the late 1960s and 1976 seems to have taken place.&#13;
Given the high level of the TFR (and, by inference, the total&#13;
marital fertility rate) during the l960s--a level higher than that of the&#13;
reported desired family size--Costa Rican women, especially in the rural&#13;
areas, must have had a lot of incentive to control their fertility. As we&#13;
shall see, as effective contraception was made increasingly available, these&#13;
women put it to use, accelerating the decline in fertility.    By 1976, the TFR&#13;
of all women was well below four (3.5) and that of ever-married women was&#13;
close to four (3.9) (Rosero 1981:36). Thus, the number of children that women&#13;
in unions were having by then had converged to about the number they said they&#13;
wanted. Desired family size scarcely changed between 1976 and 1981 (Rosero,&#13;
1981: Table 24).  It would seem, therefore, that Costa Rican women in unions&#13;
had little further incentive by the late 1970s to reduce their fertility any&#13;
more than they had done already. This situation helps explain the levelling&#13;
off of marital fertility during the late 1970s. Whether it accounts for all&#13;
of the stall is more difficult to ascertain.&#13;
2. Acceptability and knowledge of family planning&#13;
Turning from reproductive preferences to the acceptability and&#13;
knowledge of family planning, national data are available again only for the&#13;
late 1970s or early 1980s.   Looking first at acceptability, 81 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 1 7 -&#13;
women of reproductive age in unions in 1981, in response to a direct question&#13;
about acceptability, were in favor of married couples using methods to avoid&#13;
pregnancies, while only 7 percent were opposed. Eleven percent said that it&#13;
depended on the particular circumstances of each family (Rosero 1981:56).&#13;
Indirect evidence indicates that acceptability was not much lower during the&#13;
late 1960s (Rosero et al., n.d.:74).&#13;
As for knowledge, 96 percent of urban women in unions in 1964 knew&#13;
of some method, and 86 percent of rural women in unions in 1969 had such&#13;
knowledge. By 1976, such knowledge had become universal. However, the&#13;
average number of methods known increased considerably between the 1960s and&#13;
1976, from 3.5 to 6.4 among urban women and from 2.8 to 5.6 among rural&#13;
women. In addition, from the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys of 1978 and&#13;
1981, it was learned that 93 percent knew where to obtain at least one method&#13;
in 1978, with a further increase to 98 percent in 1981.&#13;
Knowledge of specific methods increased considerably between the&#13;
1960s and 1976, especially in the rural areas (Rosero et al., n.d.: Table&#13;
6.9). With respect to sterilization, for instance, the increase in the urban&#13;
sector was from 73 percent in 1964 to 97 percent in 1976. In the rural&#13;
sector, the increase over a briefer period (1969 to 1976) was substantially&#13;
greater, from 47 to 92 percent. Well over 90 percent of the 1981 respondents&#13;
said they had heard of each of the pill, IUD, condom, and female&#13;
sterilization, and over 90 percent knew where to obtain the pill and&#13;
sterilization, 87 percent the condom, and 81 percent the IUD (Rosero 1981:&#13;
Table 27). Thus, by the late 1970s there was a very high level of knowledge&#13;
and acceptability.&#13;

3. Breastfeeding&#13;
The percentage of children born in the three years preceding the&#13;
197h NFS who were breast-fed was 75 percent, the next to lowest figure in a&#13;
comparative analysis of World Fertility Survey (WFS) data from 19 countries.&#13;
In eight of the ten Asian countries in the study, over 90 percernt of these&#13;
children were nursed. Similarly, the average duration in months of&#13;
breastfeeding for children born within the three years preceding the WFS&#13;
ranged from a high of 26 months for Bangladesh to a low of five months for&#13;
Costa Rica and Guyana (Kent 1981:14 and 17).&#13;
On the basis of the average duration of the interval since the birth&#13;
of the last child, Rosero (1981:40-41) calculated a modest increase in the&#13;
duration of breastfeeding fromi 5.6 months observed in the 1976 NFS to 7.2&#13;
months in the 1981 CPS. He adds that this increase probably took place&#13;
because of the "strong" campaign conducted by public health agen,cies during&#13;
these years to promote breastfeeding, thereby reversing the apparent decline&#13;
inferred from the shorter duration of breastfeeding among women under age 40&#13;
(5.8-5.9 months) than among women age 40-49 (7.9 months) found in the 1976&#13;
survey (Rosero et al., n.d.:65). Rosero also calculated that a one-month&#13;
increase in the duration of lactation increases post-partum infecundity by&#13;
one-third of a month (Rosero 1981:40). Hence, the observed increase of 1.6&#13;
months in the average duration of breastfeeding means there was an increase of&#13;
about one-half of a month in post-parl:um infecundity. In sum, lactation does&#13;
not seem to have been a significant factor affecting fertility during the late&#13;
1970s or earlier.&#13;
4. t'ontraception, sterilization, and abortion&#13;
In acldition to contraceptiotn, sterilization has been a significant&#13;
means of birth control in Costa Rica. Abortion, however, appears to have been&#13;
a negligible factor.&#13;
&#13;

Beginning with contraception, it is pertinent to note, as context&#13;
for the analysis of changes in contraceptive prevalence, that the fertility of&#13;
rural women during the 1960s exceeded that of urban women, on average, by&#13;
approximately 3-4 children. By the late 1970s, however, the differential was&#13;
reduced to about one child (Rosero 1981:39, and Rosero et al., n.d.:26). In&#13;
conjunction with the data on desired family size presented above, which showed&#13;
that rural women wanted only about one child more than urban women (perhaps as&#13;
many as two if allowance is made for the later date of the rural than the&#13;
urban survey and if it is assumed that desired size was declining during the&#13;
1960s), these data suggest a stronger motivation to reduce fertility among&#13;
rural than among urban women.&#13;
Let us begin the analysis by looking at women in the urban part of&#13;
the San Jose metro area in 1964 (Tables 4 and 5). The level of contraceptive&#13;
prevalence (49 percent) is strikingly high for that date. Since the National&#13;
Family Planning Program was not established until 1968, it indicates a&#13;
substantial development of private and commercial sources of services and&#13;
supplies. There was a heavy reliance on traditional non-appliance methods&#13;
(rhythm, withdrawal, douche, etc.), which were used by half of the&#13;
contraceptors. The condom was virtually the only appliance method, but it was&#13;
by far the favorite single method, used by one-third of all contraceptors.&#13;
More than 10 percent of the women had by then resorted to female&#13;
sterilization.&#13;
Prevalence was much greater among women who had completed primary&#13;
school than among those who had not. Over 70 percent of contraceptive use was&#13;
for ending reproduction, with the remainder for spacing births. This is&#13;
consistent with the observation that actual fertility exceeded desired family&#13;
size. Clearly, the motivation to control fertility was strong in urban San&#13;

Jose in 1964, particularly among the better-educated women. Attractive and&#13;
effective means of doing so, however, were scarcely available.&#13;
The prevalence of contraceptive use was not nearly as great among&#13;
rural and sem:i-urban women as among women living in urban San Jose. The 1969&#13;
survey of the former group found thal: only one-quarter of the respondents were&#13;
currently using a contraceptive, which was half of the level of prevalence in&#13;
the latter group. (The difference may, indeed, have been greater since the&#13;
rural survey was conducted five year; after the urban survey, during which&#13;
time prevalence may have increased.) The educational differential was greater&#13;
among rural (42/20) than among urban women (57/38). There was also relatively&#13;
less use of contraceptives for ending reproduction in the rural (62 percent of&#13;
users) than in the urban sector (71 percent of users). In addition, the&#13;
distribution of methods used was difEerent. The percentage using the new,&#13;
more effective methods, especially the pill, was considerably greater among&#13;
rural than among urban women. The later date of the rural survey is very&#13;
likely the reason for this differences since the importation of the pill and&#13;
the IUD increased rapidly between 19'54 and 1969 (Rosero et al., n.d.:66).   On&#13;
the! other hand, much smaller percentages of rural than urban women reported&#13;
using the natural methods and the condom.&#13;
To what extent was the lowier contraceptive prevalence in the rural&#13;
than in the urban sector the result of a weaker motivation to control&#13;
fertility or of more limited knowledge of and access to contraceptives? The&#13;
data needed toD answer this question definitively do not seem to be&#13;
available.  However, the stress in the literature on the great importance of&#13;
the establishment of the National Family Planning Program (NFPP) in getting&#13;
rural women to use contraception implies that prior to the NFPP the&#13;
availability of contraceptives was very limited for rural women.   Since the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
NFPP was established in 1968, there could hardly have been much improvement in&#13;
availability by the time of the 1969 survey.&#13;
Furthermore, with rural women saying in 1969 that they wanted on&#13;
average about five children but were estimated to have around seven then,&#13;
there would seem to have been a strong motivation to control fertility. This&#13;
should be expressed by the use of contraception to stop having more children&#13;
rather than to space births. The data show that most rural contraceptors in&#13;
1969 did report using contraceptives for the purpose of ending reproduction.&#13;
What is puzzling, however, is why the rural percentage reporting use for that&#13;
purpose is less than the urban percentage, since the difference between actual&#13;
and desired fertility seems to have been much larger among rural than among&#13;
urban women. As we just noted, the rural difference was about two children.&#13;
In the 1964 urban survey, however, the respondents' desired family size&#13;
averaged a bit over four children, even while the estimated TFR was about 4.5&#13;
around 1964. (The appropriate measure here should be the total marital&#13;
fertility rate rather than the TFR, because the respondents reporting desired&#13;
family size were women in unions. The requisite upward adjustment of the TFR,&#13;
however, would increase the difference between actual and reported desired&#13;
size among both urban and rural women, probably with little alteration of the&#13;
rural-urban differential in the gap between actual and desired fertility.)&#13;
It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that at about the time&#13;
the NFPP was established by the government, rural women were motivated to&#13;
reduce their fertility (though perhaps not as strongly as urban women), but&#13;
had only just begun to have effective means for doing so made available to&#13;
them.&#13;
The government did not then (or subsequently) adopt a policy of&#13;
reducing the birth rate. The aims of the NFPP were to improve maternal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-- 24 -&#13;
child health and to offer at little or no cost information, instruction, and&#13;
the means for the practice ol responsible parenthood. To achieve these aims,&#13;
family planning units were set up in the service centers of the Ministry of&#13;
Health and the Social Securit:y system, the coverage of which was virtually&#13;
universal (Rosero 1981:13 and n.d.:25). Given the considerable motivation to&#13;
reduce fertility, it is not surprising that the annual number of new clients&#13;
increased rapidly between 1908 and 1972, before slowing down and then peaking&#13;
in 1975-76 (Rosero 1981: Table 3). The trend in the private sector is not&#13;
known.&#13;
By 1976, contraceptive prevalence reached a very high level, one&#13;
surpassed by few developing countries. Indeed, it was comparable to that&#13;
observed in the United States and in Western Europe (Lightbourne et al.,&#13;
1982:32-33). Of the women exposed to the risk of conception (i.e., in unions,&#13;
fecund and not pregnant) in 1976, 78 percent were using some method of&#13;
contraception. The rate was substantially lower only among women 45-49 years&#13;
old (64 percent) or with no Living children (39 percent) (World Fertility&#13;
Survey, 1980:10). The increase was greater in the rural than in the urban&#13;
sector and among the lesser-educated women, which were the groups in which&#13;
prevalence was low during the 1960s. As a result, the differences in&#13;
prevalence by education and residence were reduced considerably.&#13;
As for purpose of use, among the better-educated women, the increase&#13;
in use was almost completely limitecl to the spacing of births. Among the&#13;
less-educatedL urban women, tlhere were equivalent percentage-point increases&#13;
for both purposes. The relative inc:rease, however, was much greater for&#13;
spacing than for limiting births. Only among the less-educated women in the&#13;
rural sector did the absolute and relative increases for limiting births&#13;
exceed those for spacing births. Could this have been because the gap between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
actual and desired fertility was greater among these women around 1970 than&#13;
among better educated or urban women?&#13;
Prevalence changed greatly in both the urban and rural sectors not&#13;
only with respect to use of any method but also with respect to the use of&#13;
specific methods. Pre-eminent were the increases in the use of the pill and&#13;
female sterilization, as the following summary table, excerpted from Table 5,&#13;
makes evident:&#13;

In the urban sector, the sum of the increases in the pill and&#13;
sterilization exceeds the increase in use of any method because of offsetting&#13;
declines in the use of some other methods. This did not occur among rural&#13;
women. The absolute and relative gain of the pill was greater in the urban&#13;
than in the rural sector. (The extremely large relative increase is not&#13;
significant, since it reflects the difference in the availability of the pill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
between 1964 and 1969.) This is consistent with the greater increases in use&#13;
for spacing births among urban than rural women (Table 4).   The absolute and&#13;
relative increase in the u;e of sterilization was a bit greater in the rural&#13;
than in the urban sector, which is consistent with the greater rural than&#13;
irban increase in use for limiting births (Table 4). That dLfference is so&#13;
Large, however, that one wonders why the rural-urban difference in the&#13;
absolute and relative increases in sterilization were not greater than those&#13;
observed. The explanation probably includes the fact that sterilization is&#13;
not the only means used for limiting births.It is regrettable that these data&#13;
on the kind of methods used were not broken down by purpose of use and&#13;
education, as in the case of the prevalence of use (Table 4). For then it&#13;
would be clearer how the shifts in the methods used corresponded to the&#13;
changes in the purposes for which they were used and how this occurred by&#13;
Level of education.   It would then be ascertainable, for example, whether the&#13;
Lncreased use of sterilization for the purpose of limiting blrths was greater&#13;
among the less-educated women, as the differential changes in prevalence shown&#13;
in Table 4 suggest.&#13;
Another notable point in Table 5 concerns the use of the traditional&#13;
methods.  The rural women did not use them much, in contrast with the urban&#13;
women.  This is most evident with respect to the condom, though the rural-&#13;
urban differential narrowed between the 1960s and 1976. The other significant&#13;
instance is the use of the rhythm method. The greater use of the traditional&#13;
methods by the urban than the rural women reflects the differences in&#13;
prevalence and in when the modern methods began to be distributed on a large&#13;
scale. As noted above, urban prevalence was high as early as 1964, only&#13;
shortly after the introduction of the pill and before the IUD became available&#13;
among urban women (probably especially among those who were better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
educated). Thus, this high level of prevalence had to be achieved by the use&#13;
of the traditional appliance (condom) method and the "natural" methods&#13;
(rhythm, withdrawal, douche). In the rural areas, however, where&#13;
contraceptive knowledge and availability were quite limited until the NFPP was&#13;
set up in 1968, when the pill and the IUD were available for mass&#13;
distribution, the women largely by-passed the traditional methods.&#13;
Table 5 also shows very little (if any real) change between 1976 and&#13;
1981 regarding both prevalence and type of method used. Data from a 1978&#13;
survey, not shown in Table 5, are very similar to the 1976 and the 1981 data,&#13;
reinforcing the picture of a levelling off of contraceptive use during the&#13;
late 1970s (Rosero 1981:59).&#13;
An important reason for the levelling off of sterilization was the&#13;
unfavorable publicity it received during the late 1970s. There was much press&#13;
coverage in 1977 of an inquiry by the national legislature of an alleged&#13;
campaign of mass sterilization of Costa Rican women. One year after it began,&#13;
the inquiry concluded there was no such campaign, but in the interim the&#13;
health officials had imposed restrictions on this operation (Rosero&#13;
1981:71). Indeed, the large increase in sterilization which took place&#13;
between the 1960s and 1976 might have been even greater if it had been legally&#13;
permitted for contraceptive reasons rather than simply for medical reasons and&#13;
if the NFPP (and not just the Social Security system clinics) had provided it&#13;
(Gomez and McCarthy, 1982:3, and Rosero, et al., n.d.:69).&#13;
What was the impact of sterilization on fertility? "Had no women&#13;
been sterilized in Costa Rica in the five years prior to the NFS, the total&#13;
marital fertility rate would have been 4.54, when in fact it was 4.2. Hence,&#13;
sterilization averted .34 births per married woman between 1971 and 1976," a&#13;
reduction of 7.5 percent (Gomez and McCarthy, 1982:11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
As for abortion, there is agreement (Rosero, 1981:34; Stycos,&#13;
1978:53-54; Gomez and McCarthy, 1982:8) that induced aborticn has been a&#13;
negligible influence. This is not inferred simply from the fact that it is&#13;
illegal and subject to severe penalties, nor that few respondents say they&#13;
have had an induced abortion. Dai:a from four surveys conducted between 1976&#13;
and 1981 show that the percentage of pregnancies born alive was steadily 88-89&#13;
percent. Involuntary fetal mortaLity of 11 or 12 percent would be consistent&#13;
with data reported in studies of fetal mortality (Rosero, 1981:33-34).&#13;
D. Changes in the effectiveness of the family planning program&#13;
Mauldin and Lapham (1984:40) describe the family planning program in&#13;
Costa Rice as "strong" in 1972 but: "weak" in 1982. (The scale they use&#13;
comprises four categories: strong, moderate, weak, and very weak or none.) Of&#13;
a possible maximum score of 120, Costa Rica's program in 1982 is scored only&#13;
39.8, placing it in the middle of the range (25-54) of the weak category.     Its&#13;
score on tbhe four main program components are:&#13;
Actual score       Possible score&#13;
TOTAL                                      39.8                120&#13;

Availability and accessibiLity              13.3                24&#13;
Since there are major differences in the 1972 and 1982 measures of&#13;
program effort, scores for 1972 comparable to those for 1982 are not&#13;
available. As just noted, however, the 1972 measure did result in a score&#13;
which placed the program in the "strong" category. This large deterioration&#13;
in the effectiveness of the program, from a strong one to a weak one,&#13;
coincides with the levelling off cf the fertility decline. The question&#13;
arises, then, why did the effectiveness of the program decline so much?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
To begin with, "...the crucial element which... reduced fertility in&#13;
Costa Rica [was] the spread of the (decline] to the rural zones and to the&#13;
groups with lower educational levels. If the persons without a secondary-&#13;
school education had not joined the process, scarcely a third of the decline&#13;
in fertility would have taken place." (Rosero, n.d.: 14-15). By the late&#13;
seventies, however, the fertility trend in both rural and urban areas had&#13;
levelled off and even begun to increase. Similarly, after a large drop in&#13;
their fertility (sharply reducing educational differentials), the fertility of&#13;
the poorly educated, as well as those with more schooling levelled off. The&#13;
NFPP had done much to enable the women with little education and those in&#13;
rural areas to have access to fertility-control means and services. The heavy&#13;
dependence of these women on the NFPP and public institutions which offered&#13;
sterilization operations is indicated in Table 6.&#13;
After the establishment of the NFPP in 1968, the annual number of&#13;
consultations it provided increased rapidly from 27,000 in 1968 to a peak of&#13;
235,000 in 1976. Between that year and 1980 the number levelled off at around&#13;
225,000. Similarly, the number of new users served by the NFPP, after rising&#13;
from almost 10,000 in 1968 to 31,000 in 1976, declined to 20,000 in 1980. In&#13;
addition, since 1977 public health institutions do not provide a sterilization&#13;
operation "...without a strong medical reason to justify it" (Rosero,&#13;
n.d.:32). Summarizing the shortcomings of the program in the late 1970s,&#13;
Rosero (n.d.:27) notes that it "is not part of an official policy to reduce&#13;
births, it has not been encouraged by the principal leaders of the country, it&#13;
does not offer abortion or sterilization, it does not conduct follow-up&#13;
activities in the home, and the work of training and motivating medical&#13;
personnel has lost its initial impulse."&#13;

There are a number of reasons why the NFPP and the sterilization&#13;
program reached their peaks around 1976 (Gallagher, 1980:10). By that date,&#13;
the initial zeal of the personnel who had started the program was flagging.&#13;
There was growing opposition from the left and the right, and prominent&#13;
political leaLders or groups were no longer providing support. In addition,&#13;
new medical aLrguments arose questioning the need for and the efficacy of the&#13;
program. Unfavorable publicity resulted from the rumors that the NFPP was&#13;
sponsoring a massive campaign to sterilize Costa Rican women. Though the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
rumors were found to be without foundation, the bad publicity created&#13;
persisting doubts. There were also complaints about the harmful side effects&#13;
of some contraceptives, and a judgement was obtained against the program on&#13;
the grounds that the IUD was a form of induced abortion and hence illegal.&#13;
The case was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court, but again it left a bad&#13;
impression.&#13;
Moreover, policy was modified (though not overtly) by a new, more&#13;
conservative government, which took office in 1978. The National Population&#13;
Council was replaced by a new interministerial organization, the National&#13;
Commission for Population Policies, only one member of which seemed concerned&#13;
with population issues. The Commission recognized family planning as a right,&#13;
independent of any demographic objectives that might be sought, but otherwise&#13;
it did little and was not expected (as of around 1979) to do more.&#13;
E. Social and economic changes&#13;
Real per capita income grew at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent&#13;
in Costa Rica between 1960 and 1982 (World Bank, 1984: Table 1). At such a&#13;
rate, doubling time is 25 years. Hence, there was almost a doubling of real&#13;
per capita income during this 22-year period, raising Costa Rica to the ranks&#13;
of the middle-income countries.&#13;
From at least 1950 on, Costa Rica became increasingly urban and&#13;
industrial. The pace of urbanization was slow, however, with the percent of&#13;
the population living in urban places increasing only modestly between 1960&#13;
and 1982, from 37 to 43 percent (World Bank, 1984: Table 22). But&#13;
industrialization was more rapid, with the percent of the male labor force in&#13;
agriculture declining from 63 percent to 42 percent between 1950 and 1975.&#13;
The pace of change was much swifter after 1960 than before (Table 7).&#13;
Similarly, the share of GNP of industrial origin increased much more rapidly&#13;
during the 1960-75 period than during the decade 1950-60.&#13;

Though life expectancy increased at the same steady pace during both&#13;
of these periods, the decline in the infant mortality rate accelerated after&#13;
1960. Primary school enrollment was virtually universal by 1960, but there&#13;
were very large increases in enrollment in secondary schools and in higher&#13;
education between 1960 and 1981 (World Bank, 1984: Table 25):&#13;

Percent of 20-24 year olds&#13;
enrolled in higher education         5             26&#13;
And, lest there be any doubt that women were sharing in these educational&#13;
advances, it should be noted that a larger percentage of females than males&#13;
age 12-17 were enrolled in secondary school in 1981, 51 percent versus 44&#13;
percent (World Bank 1984:199). Indicative of the trend is the fact that the&#13;
percentage of women age 20-34 (the main childbearing ages) completing primary&#13;
school increased between 1950 and 1973 from 20 to 53 percent, with an&#13;
acceleration taking place after 1963, when the percent completing primary&#13;
school was 32 percent (Rosero, n.d.:19).&#13;
There was also a considerable expansion of the means of communi-&#13;
cation between 1950 and 1975. Per capita newspaper circulation rose at a&#13;
modest, steady pace, but per capita telephone installations accelerated very&#13;
sharply after 1960 (Table 7). There was little TV prior to 1963, but once&#13;
introduced, it was adopted rapidly, as the following figures comparing radio&#13;
and TV indicate (Rosero, n.d.:20):&#13;

Rosero (n.d.:17-18) argues that fertility started to clecline in 1960&#13;
because social and economic development had reached a threshold level for a&#13;
decline at around that time.   Furthermore, he contends that the pace of the&#13;
fertility decline was influenced by the subsequent rate of social and economic&#13;
development (Rosero, n.d.:34 and Rosero, 1981:12). As noted above, in a&#13;
number of respects, the pace of development accelerated between 1960 and 1975,&#13;
during which period fertility declined rapidly.    Given the apparent&#13;
asscciation between the rate of development and the rate of fertility decline&#13;
during the period 1960-75, it would be helpful to have a homogeneous time&#13;
series of development indicators to around 1980.   We could then see whether&#13;
there was a stall in the development trend, as well as in the fertility&#13;
decline, during the period 1975-80.&#13;
Stycos (1982:25) concludes that the key factors were education in&#13;
initiating the fertility decline and the national family planning program in&#13;
spreading it to rural and low status women.   "... a very high urban or a high&#13;
literacy threshLold was required before fertility was affected" (Stycos&#13;
1982:29).  Urbanization's influence was mainly via its relationship with&#13;
literacy, and "literacy's effect on fertility was explained both by lower&#13;
marital fertility and higher proportions of single women in areas of higher&#13;
literacy." Furthermore, Stycos speculates that lower marital fertility "was&#13;
achieved by such means as coitus interruptus or periodic abstinence" (Stycos,&#13;
1982:29). The mechanisms whereby the initial decline began to spread to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
less modernized cantons of the country "remain obscure." "A diffusion&#13;
hypothesis is tempting," but the rapidity of the process makes it seem more&#13;
like "near-instantaneous osmosis" (Stycos 1982:29-30). During the last stage&#13;
of the decline, family planning "clinics were established where they were most&#13;
needed" and "use of the new clinic-distributed methods ... acted to accelerate&#13;
a decline already initiated by socio-economic forces" (Stycos 1982:28 and 30).&#13;
In Stycos' analysis, nothing is said about fertility preferences.&#13;
Did increasing education and economic development, especially after 1950, lead&#13;
Costa Rican women to reduce their family size desires? Or had the number of&#13;
children wanted been moderate for some time already, with the number born&#13;
exceeding the number wanted for lack of effective means of control? The&#13;
latter seems to be the more reasonable interpretation of the available data.&#13;
As was observed above (in the discussion of fertility preferences), the&#13;
average number of children desired was reported to be between four and five&#13;
during the 1960s, when the TFR was falling from over seven (early 1960s) to&#13;
close to five (1969). By 1976, the mean desired family size reported by&#13;
survey respondents was still between four and five (Rosero 1981:47). A&#13;
correction for rationalization, however, suggests that desired family size was&#13;
more likely 3.5-4.0 than 4.0-5.0 (Rosero 1981:47). In any case, by 1976 the&#13;
TFR had fallen to under four (Table 1). Thus, it appears that by the middle&#13;
of the 1970s, Costa Rican women were having the number of children they wanted&#13;
and were no longer motivated to reduce their fertility any further. The&#13;
levelling off of contraceptive use between 1976 and 1981 is consistent with&#13;
this argument. In addition, under these conditions, the weaker governmental&#13;
support of the family planning program during the late 1970s (noted above),&#13;
may have been more feasible politically than it would have been previously.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Summary&#13;
Fertility dropped swiftly ifrom 1960 to the mid 1970s, but then&#13;
levelled off during the late 1970s. The birth rate fell nearly 40 percent&#13;
from 48 in 1960 to about 30 around 1975, while the total fertility rate fell&#13;
more rapidly--practically halving--from 7.3 in 1960 to 3.7 in 1976. Between&#13;
1976 and 1980 it fluctuated between 3.7 and 3.9. The birth rate increased&#13;
somewhat during the late 1970s as a result of the continued increase in the&#13;
proportion of women of reproductive age.&#13;
In the early phase o0E the decline (1960-65), changes in age&#13;
structure contributed somewhat to the fall. But between 1965 and 1978, the&#13;
birth rate would have dropped by 16 points instead of 10 if there had been no&#13;
change in age composition. As for nuptiality, it had an effect like that of&#13;
the change in age structure during the period 1960-65, but had a negligible&#13;
effect thereafter.&#13;
The main reason for the fall in fertility was the drop in marital&#13;
fertility. The latter occurred because of a rapid increase in the use of&#13;
contraception, particularly the newly introduced, more efficient methods. The&#13;
rapid increase in use occurred because, with marital fertility exceeding the&#13;
number of children wanted during the 1960s, there was considerable incentive&#13;
to control fertility. Then the National Family Planning Program, which was&#13;
established in 1968, expanded rapidly, particularly in rural areas and among&#13;
the poor, providing contraceptive services and supplies at little or no&#13;
cost. Consequently, the fertility decline accelerated. By 1974-75, the TFR&#13;
of ever-married women had dropped to around four, which was about the average&#13;
level of desired family size.&#13;
Perhaps it was no coincidence, then, that the fertility decline&#13;
stalled thereafter. Marital fertility plateaued between 1974-75 and 1979-80,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
probably because of the levelling off of contraceptive use (including&#13;
contraceptive sterilization) which took place then. The latter may well have&#13;
occurred as a result of either or both of (1) the convergence of desired and&#13;
actual fertility by the late seventies, or (2) the weakening of the family&#13;
planning program after 1976, as political support for it waned.&#13;
Abortion has been a negligible factor, and lactational infecund-&#13;
ability a minor one.&#13;

KOREA&#13;
I. Fertility trend&#13;
Because birth registration has been incomplete, Korean fertility has&#13;
been estimated mainly from census data (using the own-children method) and&#13;
survey data (Cho et al., 1982:1-2).   Fertility declined by about 50 percent&#13;
during the two decades of the 1960s and 1970s (Table 8). But the decline was&#13;
not. continuous; two periods of stalled fertility can be observed, 1967-71 and&#13;
1975-80. Between 1960 and 1967 fertility fell sharply, then levelled off&#13;
until 1972. Ak further rapid fall occurred until 1975. Then, the decline&#13;
decelerated greatly through 1980, the last date for which data are&#13;
available. Of the countries included in this study, Korea is the only one in&#13;
which two staLls have taken place.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1967 the CBR fell 28 percent, from 42.1 to 30.3.&#13;
Then, between 1967 and 1972, it dropped only three percent. This stall was&#13;
followed by a swifter decline than the first one, with the CBR dropping 23&#13;
percent between 1972 and 1975, from 29.3 to 22.8. Between 197'i and 1980, the&#13;
CBR again came to a virtual halt, falling only two percent.&#13;
A similar pattern of decline-pause-decline-pause can be seen in the&#13;
trends of the general fertility rate (GFR) and the TFR. The main difference&#13;
bet:ween these two measures and the CBR is that they declined somewhat more&#13;
that the CBR. Between 1960 and 1980 they fell 54 percent, whereas the CBR&#13;
feLl 47 percent. The reason for this difference is that the proportion of&#13;
women of childbearing age (15-49 years) in the population increased from 23 to&#13;
almost 27 percent.  Such an increase inflates the CBR but has no effect on the&#13;
GFR or the TFR. Thus, there was a decline in fertility between 1960 and 1980&#13;

of 54 percent. Seven points of this decline was offset, however, by an&#13;
increase in the relative number of women of childbearing age. Interestingly,&#13;
between 1960 and 1967, this relative number appears to have fa]Llen a little to&#13;
about 22.6 percent. Thereafter, however, it increased steadily, reaching 26.7&#13;
percent in 1980. As a result, the declines in the GFR and the TFR were&#13;
greater than the drop in the CBR only after 1967. Whereas the CBR fell only&#13;
two percent between 1975 and 1980, the TFR dropped by 12 percent. The TFR of&#13;
1980 (2.7) and 1982 (2.7) suggest that fertility may have begun to level off&#13;
during the early 1980s.&#13;
II. Explanation of the trend&#13;
A. Changes in the crude birth rate&#13;
In addition to the changes in the proportion of women of&#13;
childbearing age noted above., the trend in the CBR was influenced by the&#13;
changes in the age-specific birth rate (ASBR) of women of childbearing age.&#13;
With few exceptions, these rates fell steadily between 1960 and 1980&#13;
(Table 9). Two of three exceptions, however, are notable and significant.&#13;
Among women 25-29 years of age, at which age the ASBRs have been highest,&#13;
there were increases (even iiE only slight) between 1966 and 1970 (roughly the&#13;
period of the first stall) and 1975 and 1980 (the time of the second stall).&#13;
The second exception is that there was no change between 1966 and 1970 in the&#13;
ASBRs of women 30-34 years oLd.   The! ASBRs of these women, though lower than&#13;
those of women aged 25-29 years, were nevertheless very high until the late&#13;
1970s. (The third exception, the slight increase between 1960 and 1966 in the&#13;
ASBRs of women 45-49 years of age, because of the very low level of the ASBRs,&#13;
is of negligible import.)&#13;

13. Changes in the age-specific birth rates&#13;
These changes are determined by changes in the percentage of women&#13;
married at various ages and in the rates at which married women give birth.&#13;
The TFR, which summarizes the ASBRs, changed little between the 1930s and&#13;
L960s because the increase in marital fertility which occurred during that&#13;
period was offset by a large decrease in the proportion married, especially&#13;
among those under 25 years of age. In 1935, the average age at first marriage&#13;
l'or women was about 17 years. By 1960 it had increased to 21.5 years. After&#13;
]L960, women's average age ast marriage continued to rise, even if at a slower&#13;
rate than during the precedling years, and by 1975 it was close to 24 years.&#13;
At such a high level, little further increase was expected.&#13;
T'hese changes imply that the percentage currently emarried decreased&#13;
greatly amoing women under 25. Table 10 shows just how large these declines&#13;
were. Whereas most girls 15-19 years old were married during the 1930s, by&#13;
t:he mid-196'Ds virtually none were. Though not as massive, the decline among&#13;
women aged 20-24 was also d[ramatic. During the 1930s, in accordance with the&#13;
traditional custom, virtually all women were married by that age. But by&#13;
1975, little more than a third were.   An estimate for 1980 indicates little&#13;
change in this percentage. Among older women the prevalence of marriage fell&#13;
at all ages between 1935 and 1955, though by much smaller amounts than among&#13;
the younger women. After 1955, however, except for women 25-29 years old, the&#13;
declining trend was reversed, as the reduction in mortality lowered the&#13;
prevalence of widowhood.  In a society such as Korea's, in which there is&#13;
Little out-of-wedlock fertility, such a great increase in the average age at&#13;
lEirst marriage means a corr-espondingly great increase in the average age at&#13;
which childbearing begins.&#13;

These data on marriage explain much of the decline in fertility, bul:&#13;
they shed little light on the reasons for the stalls during the late 1960s and&#13;
the late 1970s. We need, therefore, to look at the changes in marital&#13;
Eertility.&#13;
As the data in Table 11 make plain, there were large drops in&#13;
marital fertility between L960 and 1980 among wives older than age 29. Among&#13;
wives 15-24 years old, the rates fluctuated without any definite change. The&#13;
fluctuating pattern was also evident for wives 25-29 year of age, but there&#13;
seems to have been a modest: decline between 1960 and 1980. Again, these data&#13;
seem to help us understand the general decline in fertility but not the&#13;
reasons for the stalls. IfE, however, we look at the pace of change in each of&#13;
the four periods of the 1960s and 1970s (the first and second halves of each&#13;
decade) and compare these changes in marital fertility with those of all&#13;
women, a pattern emerges which does throw light on the stalls.&#13;

The comparison, shown in Table 12, is limited to women 20-44 years&#13;
old because the low birth rates of women 15-19 and 45-49 mean that changes at&#13;
these ages could hardly have had any effect. Two patterns are worth noting.&#13;
The first tells us the reasons for the fertility decline. In this pattern, we&#13;
see that the percentage changes during the four periods were very similar in&#13;
the two groups of women, except among those 20-24 years of age. Though the&#13;
marital fertility of the latter did not change much until the late 1970s, the&#13;
fertility of all women of this age fell substantially and continuously from&#13;
1960 on. This tells us that it was the large declines in the prevalence of&#13;
marriage at this age which was responsible for the drop in fertility from 1960&#13;
to 1975. Between 1975 and 1980 there was virtually no further decline in the&#13;
percent married, so the 15 percent drop then among all women is accounted for&#13;
by the 15 percent decline in marital fertility. As was noted above, when&#13;
examining the changes in the prevalence of marriage, there was much less&#13;
change in prevalence among women over age 24. It is not surprising,&#13;
therefore, that the changes in the fertility of all women aged 25-44 during&#13;
the four periods examined here closely parallel the changes in the fertility&#13;
of wives of this age. So, the sharp reductions in the prevalence of marriage&#13;
among women under age 25 reduced their fertility between 1960 and 1975.&#13;
During the subsequent period, however, the reason for the fall in the&#13;
fertility of these young women was a drop in their marital fertility. The&#13;
same reason accounts for the decline in fertility of women over age 24.&#13;
The second notable pattern helps to explain the stalls. During the&#13;
period 1966-70, roughly coincident to the time of the first stall, the&#13;
proportionate fertility declines in all age groups from 20 to 44 either slowed&#13;
down or were reversed. During the late 1970s, when the second stall occurred,&#13;
there was a similar tendency, but it was less pronounced at ages 25-39 and did&#13;

not occur at all among those 20-24 and 40-44 years of age. By then, however,&#13;
the birth rates of women 35-44 years old had fallen to very low levels and was&#13;
greatly reduced among those aged 20-24. Indeed, as may be seen in Table 11,&#13;
fertility became increasingly concentrated among women 25-29. Whereas their&#13;
ASBR accounted for 27 percent of the TFR in 1960, by 1980 it accounted for 48&#13;
percent. It is all the more significant, therefore, that at this age the&#13;
fertility decline was reversed during both the late 1960s and the late 1970s,&#13;
even if the increases then were only slight. Among women aged 30-34, whose&#13;
fertility had also been high, there was no change between 1966 and 1970, a&#13;
pronounced break from the trend of sharp decline during the preceding and the&#13;
following period. During the late 1970stheir fertility continued to fall, but&#13;
at less than half the rate of decline of the preceding period.&#13;
The data in Table 13 measure and summarize the relative effect of&#13;
the changes in marital status and marital fertility on the decline of the TFR&#13;
in each of the three periods between 1960 and 1975. During this interval the&#13;
TFR fell by almost three children per woman, and three-quarters of that fall&#13;
resulted from the decline in marital fertility. Almost all of the fall in&#13;
marital fertility occurred to wives 30-49 years old. Indeed, among younger&#13;
wives, there was a substantial increase in marital fertility during the period&#13;
1966-70, accounting for most of the deceleration in the fall of the TFR which&#13;
took place then. The other factor contributing to this deceleration was the&#13;
increase in the percent married of women 30-49.&#13;
Unfortunately, the period of the second stall was not included in&#13;
this analysis. But the available data indicate that the drop in the TFR of&#13;
about 0.4 of a child per woman (Table 8) resulted overwhelmingly from the&#13;
continued decline in marital fertility among women 30-49 (Table 12). (As&#13;
Table 10 shows there was little change in the prevalence of marriage during&#13;

this interval.) The decline in marital fertility was moderated by a&#13;
deceleration in the decline among wives aged 30-34 and an increase (even if&#13;
slight) among wives 25-29 (Table 12). During this period, the ASBRs of women&#13;
25-34 accounted for about 65 percent of the TFR.&#13;
C. Changes in the percent married&#13;
As noted above, there was a very large drop in the percent married&#13;
between 1935 and 1955. Data on the average age at marriage indicate that the&#13;
change occurred mainly after 1940. The period from 1940 to 1955 was&#13;
characterized by political and social upheaval and severe economic&#13;
deterioration, with World War II, the end of Japanese rule, the partitioning&#13;
of Korea, and the Korean War. The poor economic conditions made early&#13;
marriage difficult, and the Korean War also caused a delay in marriage.&#13;
By 1960, the average age at first marriage had reached a fairly high&#13;
level. Nevertheless, it continued to rise about as rapidly as before,&#13;
reaching one of the highest levels in the world by 1970. (At that date, it&#13;
was over 23 for women and over 27 for men.) The factors responsible were&#13;
rapid urbanization, swift educational expansion, and compulsory military&#13;
service of three years for males (Cho et al., 1982:85-86).&#13;
These changes help account for the general decline in fertility but&#13;
not the two stalls in the decline.&#13;

The determinants of changes in marital fertility are changes in (1)&#13;
preferences regarding the number and sex of children and when they should be&#13;
born, (2) breastfeeding practices, and (3) the use of birth control.&#13;
1. Fertility preferences&#13;
Number of children. Data on the ideal number of children obtained in&#13;
numerous surveys indicate that changes in family-size norms generally parallel&#13;
the decline in fertility (see Table 14). The data also show that the decline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-- 50 -&#13;
in these norms appears to have levelled off during the late 1960s and late&#13;
1970s, when the stalls occurred. Related to the general decline in the number&#13;
of children wanted are changes in the value of children, which seem to have&#13;
resulted from the rapid urbanization and industrialization Korea. experienced&#13;
during the 1960s and 1970s. The utility of children as workers on the family&#13;
farm or business or as contributors to the family income has been declining.&#13;
Similarly, the expectation that children will suppport their parents in old&#13;
age, though strong, has been cleclining. Furthermore, children hLave become&#13;
more expensive to raise as the society has urbanized and education has&#13;
expanded (Cho et al., 1982:8-51).&#13;

Sex of children. There has long been a strong preference for sons in&#13;
Korea. Though the number of children wanted and born has been cut in half,&#13;
son preference has not weakened as much and is still clearly evident. The&#13;
eldest son traditionally has had the responsibility for carrying on the family&#13;
name, ancestor worship, and support of the elderly parents. Thus, no more&#13;
than one son is needed today, when mortality is low, to perform these&#13;
duties. As a result, Korean couples want one son, but once they have one son&#13;
most couples do not want another, unless he is their only living child (Table&#13;
15).&#13;

There is a disagreement about the impact of son preference on&#13;
fertility, in particular whether it will make the further reduction of Korean&#13;
fertility difficult. The author of one study, for example, says that his&#13;
findings "seem to indicate that ... son preference strongly affects Korean&#13;
fertility" (Park, 1983: 348). And the! Korea (sic) Institute for Population&#13;
and Health (1982:2) contends tihat "son preference in Korea exerts a&#13;
substantial influence on family planning practice.... For example, 71 percent&#13;
of couples with two sons are practicing contraception, while only 41 of those&#13;
with two daughters are doing so."   In another study, however, the author&#13;
concludes that "it is likely that son preference will have some dampening&#13;
effect on the fertility decline in Korea, but that it will not be a major&#13;
obstacle to the achievement of Korea's fertility goals" (Arnold, 1983: 22).&#13;
In the latter study it is assumed that if sex preferences were to disappear&#13;
"couples at each parity would act in the same manner as those at the same&#13;
parity who are currently most satisfied with the sex composition of their&#13;
children" (Arnold, 1983: 7). IJsing data from the Korean National Fertility&#13;
Survey of 1974, and this assumption, it is found that the percentage of&#13;
currently married, fecund women wanting no more children would rise by only&#13;
five percentage points, from 75 to 80 percent. The rate of contraceptive use&#13;
would rise more (from 46 to 55 percent), but the increase would still be only&#13;
a minor fraction of the actual rate. The author also notes, however, that the&#13;
use of data on past as well as present sex preferences would result in a&#13;
stronger effect of sex preference on fertility in Korea than found in his&#13;
study (Arnold, 1983: 19). How much stronger is not indicated.&#13;
Timing preferences. It was noted above that the average age at first&#13;
marriage rose greatly, while fertility among women over age 29 fell&#13;
tremendously. Consequently, childbearing came to be concentrated increasingly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
at age 25-29. Analysis of data from a 1976 survey indicated that the ideal&#13;
span between marriage and the last birth was only 5-7 years for the majority&#13;
of the respondents (Rindfuss et al., 1982:100). First, second, and third&#13;
birth intervals decreased sharply during the late 1960s. At the same time,&#13;
higher birth intervals tended to level off, in contrast to increases during&#13;
the early 1960s and early 1970s. These changes help to account for the&#13;
fertility stall of the late 1960s (Cho et al., 1982:49). (No information is&#13;
available about fertility timing during the late 1970s.)&#13;
A major reason for the reduction in the first birth interval was a&#13;
rapid increase in the rate of premarital pregnancy, which was associated with&#13;
a shift from arranged to romantic marriages. The relative number of first&#13;
births that occurred within nine months of marriage rose between 1955 and 1970&#13;
from about 10 to almost 30 percent. Reductions in the birth intervals after&#13;
the first seem to have resulted in part from declines in the duration of&#13;
breastfeeding (Rindfuss et al., 1982:91 and 97).&#13;
Breastfeeding. Nursing has been nearly universal in Korea for a long&#13;
time. But during the past few decades, lengthy breastfeeding has become less&#13;
popular. In 1950, for instance, nearly half of the mothers who nursed their&#13;
first child did so for at least 24 months. By 1970, less than 20 percent&#13;
nursed their first child that long. There was a similar decline in the&#13;
proportion nursing more than 18 months, but no change in the shorter period of&#13;
more than nine months (Cho et al., 1982:55). These changes in nursing&#13;
practices tended to reduce the interval between lower-parity births.&#13;
Furthermore, survey data indicate that women with no sons may have&#13;
deliberately stopped breastfeeding in order to accelerate the birth of the&#13;
child, in hope of getting a son (Rindfuss, et al., 1982:102).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Changes in birth control. The government established a national&#13;
faffily planning program in 1962.  At. that time, abortion was the only&#13;
effective method, but was infrequently used (Cho et al., 1982: 6). Birth&#13;
control was actopted rapidly, however, and by 1976 it was "practically&#13;
universal" (Foreit, 1982: 234). The gains were more rapid among rural women&#13;
and those with relatively little education, narrowing educational and&#13;
residential differentials considerably CCho et al., 1982: 132-34).&#13;
Abortion. Table 16 shows that the total induced abortion rate (TIAR)&#13;
increased more than four times during the period 1960-76, with ihe increase&#13;
considerably swifter among rural women. (Seventy-two percent oiE Korea was&#13;
rural in 1960.   By 1980, only 43 percent was rural.)   This measure may be&#13;
interpreted to mean that, whereas in 1960 about one of every two ever-married&#13;
women (550 per 1000) would have had an abortion by the end of her reproductive&#13;
years, by 1976 every 10 ever-married women would have had 23 abortions (2310&#13;
per 1000) by the time they concluded their childbearing. This interpretation&#13;
assumes that the women would have experienced throughout their reproductive&#13;
life cycle the age-specific induced abortion rates that occurred at each&#13;
date. This would happen if the rates scarcely changed over the years. This,&#13;
of course, dicl not happen. (The rapid rise in abortion rates implies that&#13;
these TIARs underestimate the average number of abortions ever-married women&#13;
actually had or would have.) Given this rapid increase in the ase of induced&#13;
abcrtion, the proportion of ever-married women having one (as well as the&#13;
average number of abortions they had) rose substantially, from 13 percent in&#13;
1966 to 50 percent in 1982 (Table 17).   There are indications that abortion&#13;
has been under reported, but it is not clear whether or not reporting became&#13;
more complete over time, especially after 1973, when the abortion law was&#13;
liberalized (Westoff, 1980: 61).&#13;

Contraception.  There was also a steady and considerable gain in the&#13;
use of other methods of birth control, as Table 18 makes eviderLt. In 1961, it&#13;
appears that only about 10 percent of wives of reproductive age used&#13;
contraceptives (including contraceptive sterilization).    By 1979, more than&#13;
half such women were doing so, with the figure continuing to rise at least&#13;
through 1982.&#13;

The IUD was the favorite method until the late 1970s, when the&#13;
popularity of sterilization leaped dramatically. There was, in addition, a&#13;
notable gain during the 1970s in the use of "other" methods. This category&#13;
includes douche, rhythm, spermicides, and withdrawal (Cho et al. 1982: 135),&#13;
all of which are less effective than the other methods specified in Table&#13;
18. Thus, of the increase of 34 percentage points between 1966 and 1979, 24&#13;
points (71 percent) were accounted for by the more efficient methods and 10&#13;
points (29 percent) by the less efficient methods. Among the efficient&#13;
methods, sterilization accounted for a large majority of the gain. Between&#13;
1979 and 1982, female sterilization continued to gain rapidly, while the other&#13;
methods declined or showed little increase (condom).&#13;
The use of sterilization increased sharply and abruptly between 1975&#13;
and 1977. Why? During the 1960s the annual sterilization rate (either&#13;
vasectomy or tubal ligation) per 1000 ever-married women (themselves or their&#13;
husbands) aged 20-39 was very low. After 1969, however, it began to rise.&#13;
From well under 5 per 1000 in 1969, it reached close to 10 by 1973. Then it&#13;
accelerated to over 20 in 1975, 30 in 1976, and over 60 in 1977 (Westoff et&#13;
al. 1980: Figure 1). While the vasectomy rate essentially levelled off&#13;
between 1975 and 1977, the tubal ligation rate jumped from 11 to 53 per&#13;
1000. This happened because the procedure became simpler and safer than it&#13;
had been with the introduction of laparoscopy in 1976. In addition,&#13;
government payments to physicians were tripled, lowering the patients' costs&#13;
considerably (Westoff et al. 1980: 136-137).&#13;
Relationships among abortion, contraception, and sterilization.&#13;
Women who used contraception have been much more likely to have had an induced&#13;
abortion than women who did not use contraceptives (Table 19). Since use of&#13;
contraceptives indicates a desire to avoid pregnancy, it is not surprising&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
that users are more likely than non-users to terminate a pregnancy. The&#13;
Korean National Fertility Survey of 1974 found that, of those who had never&#13;
used contraception, only 1] percent had had an induced abortion. Among those&#13;
who had used contraception, however, the percentage who had had an induced&#13;
abortion was about four times as great (Donaldson et al. 1982: 229).    It is&#13;
clear, therefore, that abortion has been a supplement rather than an&#13;
alternative to contraception for many Korean women.&#13;

Though the relationship is not nearly as strong, there was also a&#13;
positive association between sterilization and abortion; in ].978 couples in&#13;
which the wife had had an abortion were more likely to be sterilized than&#13;
those in which the wife had not had an abortion (Westoff et al. 1980: Figure&#13;
9).  More importantly, it appears that sterilization has been "making a major&#13;
contribution to reducing abortions. Depending upon assumptions about the&#13;
amount of underreporting of abortions in the 1978 survey, we estimate that&#13;
sterilization may be averting as much as one abortion per woman" (Westoff, et&#13;
al. 1980: 145). On the other hand, because of the frequency of use of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
abortion to prevent unwanted births, sterilization has had a relatively small&#13;
impact on fertility. The number of births averted by sterilization is&#13;
estimated to have been 0.13 (2.9 percent of the total marital fertility rate)&#13;
in 1973-74, 0.18 (4.2 percent of the TMFR) in 1975-76 and 0.30 (9.2 percent of&#13;
the TMFR) in 1977-78 (Westoff et al., 1980: 145). It is apparent, however,&#13;
that though sterilization's impact was small during these years, it was&#13;
growing.&#13;
The timing of changes in birth control and fertility. The large&#13;
general decline in fertility during the 1960s and 1970s clearly coincides with&#13;
the large general increase in the use of abortion, contraception, and&#13;
sterilization. It is more difficult, however, to detect whether or not there&#13;
are parallels in the trends of adoption of abortion, contraception and&#13;
sterilization and the decline-stall-decline-stall pattern of fertility&#13;
decline. On the one hand, the total induced abortion rate (TIAR) increased&#13;
rapidly between 1960 and 1969, then declined somewhat through at least 1971,&#13;
only to rise substantially again some time between 1971 and 1976 (see Table&#13;
16). These fluctuations approximate those of the total fertility rate. On&#13;
the other hand, Table 17 indicates that the percentage of ever-married women&#13;
who had an induced abortion rose just as much (in percentage points) between&#13;
1966 and 1971 as between 1971 and 1976. Nor did there seem to be any&#13;
slackening of the increase after 1976. But since the latter measure is a&#13;
cumulative one, while the former is not, changes in the TIAR may provide a&#13;
better measure of the short-run variations in the use of abortion.&#13;
Similarly equivocal are the data on contraception in Table 18. The&#13;
increases in the use of any method of contraception parallel the fluctuating&#13;
trend of fertility decline, but the changes in the use of specific methods are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

not as consistent. Regarding all methods, the absolute and relative&#13;
percentage-point increases were:&#13;

a. More effective methods&#13;
b. Less effective methods&#13;
There was a much larger increase in all methods during the early 1960s and&#13;
1970s than the late 1960s, which is consistent with the fertility trend. The&#13;
very large increase in sterilization after 1976, however, is not consistent&#13;
with the slowdown in the rate of fertility decline which occurred then, even&#13;
allowing for the decline in the use of the other effective methods (i.e., the&#13;
IUD, pill and condom), unless the latter are used much more than the former by&#13;
women in the main childbearing ages, 25-34.&#13;
In sum, though not as definite as one would like, the available data&#13;
on changes in the use of birth control seem to be roughly congruent with the&#13;
decline-pause-decline-pause pattern of fertility change. Why there were such&#13;
fluctuations in the use of birth control is not evident.&#13;
E. Social and economic change and the national family planning program&#13;
Major social and economic change occurred in Korea -between 1960 and&#13;
1980 (Table 20). Real per capita income increased more than threefold. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
society changed from being highly rural and agrarian to predominantly urban&#13;
and industrial. The means of communication expanded greatly, as did the&#13;
education of the population. The rapid increase in the education of women of&#13;
reproductive age is particularly important, given the pronounced inverse&#13;
relationship between women's education and fertility that has been found in&#13;
Korea and elsewhere (Cho et al., 1982: 61-62). Under these conditions, the&#13;
value of children changed, their costs increased, and couples began to want&#13;
fewer of them. At the same time, with an average annual rate of population&#13;
growth of 2.7 percent during the period 1960-66, the government came to see&#13;
the need for lowering it in order to help raise per capita income and set a&#13;
target of reducing it to 2.0 percent by 1970. The Planned Parenthood&#13;
Federation of Korea was established in 1961 with a high government official as&#13;
its president. In the following year, a national family planning program was&#13;
started and a Korean Institute for Family Planning was established. Over the&#13;
years, a number of government agencies have made important contributions to&#13;
the success of the family planning program (Cho et al. 1982:126-129).&#13;
Mauldin and Lapham (1984:40-41) characterize this program as strong&#13;
in 1972 and 1982. At the latter date its total score of 96.9 (out of a&#13;
possible maximum total score of 120) is second only to that of China, with a&#13;
score of 100.9. Its scores on the four main components are:&#13;

Since there are major differences in the 1972 and 1982 measures of&#13;
program effort, scores for 1972 comparable to these for 1982 are not&#13;
available. As just noted, however, the 1972 measure did result in a "strong"&#13;
score.&#13;
These measures are congruent with the general increase in induced&#13;
abortion and the use of contraception and the decline of fertility during the&#13;
1970s. They do not, however, shed any light on the reason for the marked&#13;
deceleration in the fertility decline during the late 1970s. As for the&#13;
1960s, there is no evaluation of the system of birth control servicing (i.e.,&#13;
information, supplies and services) in either the public or private sectors.&#13;
The description of the rapid expansion of the public sector (i.e., the&#13;
national family planning program) and the data showing the large increases in&#13;
induced abortion and the use of contraception during the 1960s strongly&#13;
suggest that there was an increase in the effectiveness of the national&#13;
program during the 1960s. Similar to the information about the 1970s,&#13;
however, this inference sheds no light on the reasons for the stall in the&#13;
fertility decline during the late 1960s.&#13;
F. Summary&#13;
During the two decades of fertility decline in Korea, there were two&#13;
periods in which the decline stalled. Nearly all of the 48 percent drop in&#13;
the crude birth rate, from 42 in 1960 to 22 in 1980, took place during the&#13;
early 1960s (1960-66) and early 1970s (1972-75). Similarly, though the total&#13;
fertility rate fell 55 percent during the two decades, from 6.0 to 2.7, it&#13;
virtually levelled off from 1967 to 1971 and decelerated markedly after 1975.&#13;
Between 1966 and 1970 an increase in marriage among those 30-49&#13;
years old, as well as an increase in marital fertility of those under 30,&#13;
offset declines in marriage among women 15 to 29 years old and in the marital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
fertility of women age 30-49. The rise in the marital fertility of the&#13;
younger women is accounted for by a sharp decrease in the first three birth&#13;
irntervals. The first interval was shortened by an increase in the proportion&#13;
of premarita]ly conceived first birt:hs, which was associated with a shift from&#13;
arranged to romantic marriages.   Reductions in the length of the second and&#13;
third birth intervals were influenced by declines in the duration of&#13;
breastfeeding and an apparently growing desire to terminate childbearing&#13;
early.&#13;
The decline in the total fertility rate decelerated considerably&#13;
during the late 1970s because of a deceleration in the decline of the birth&#13;
rate among wives aged 30-34 and an increase among wives aged 25-29. During&#13;
this period, the birth rates of women aged 25-34 accounted for about 65&#13;
percent of the total fertility rate. The reason for these fluctuations is not&#13;
known.&#13;
Despite the decline in breastfeeding, fertility fell because of a&#13;
large increase in the use of abortion and contraception, particularly the&#13;
contraceptive sterilization of women after 1975. Though the rapid rise in&#13;
tubal ligations had an increasingly depressing effect on fertility,&#13;
sterilization during this period prevented more abortions than births.&#13;
Major social and economic changes during the 1960s and 1970s--rising&#13;
income, industrialization, urbanization, increasing education, and the&#13;
diffusion of modern means of communications--led couples to want fewer&#13;
children and to adopt birth control nethods to minimize the number of unwanted&#13;
children. These changes help account for the overall decline in fertility,&#13;
but: not the fluctuations in the pace of its decline or the roughly parallel&#13;
fluctuations in the rate of adoption of birth control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The evidence is clear that Koreans prefer sons. But it is not clear&#13;
whether such a preference has weakened appreciably in recent decades or has&#13;
had any effect on the decline in fertility, let alone on the fluctuations in&#13;
the decline.&#13;

SRI LANKA&#13;
;[. Fertility Trend&#13;
When i-ertility began its susl:ained decline in Sri Lanka and how much&#13;
it f'ell are uncertain.  It appears, however, that it fell for about 20-25&#13;
years, beginning perhaps around 1950. Then it seems to have levelled off&#13;
during the late 1970s.&#13;
The f'ollowing quinquennial crude birth rates have been reported&#13;
(Sri Lanka, 1983a:8):&#13;
1941-45                   36.6&#13;
1946-50                   38.9&#13;
1951-55                   38.1&#13;
1956-60                   36.5&#13;
1961-65                   34.3&#13;
1966-70                   31.1&#13;
1971-75                   28.7&#13;
1976-80                   28.1&#13;
Wright (1968:746) reports birth rates of 39.4 in 1953 and 34.6 in 1963, both&#13;
of which are years in which a census was taken. The U.S. Bureau of the Census&#13;
(1977:5), however, reports birth rates of 44 for 1953 and 35 for 1963. The&#13;
1953 figure was; calculated, th,e report. notes, using registered births adjusted&#13;
for 12 percent underregistration (official estimate) and an adjusted mid-year&#13;
population. ThLere was a net undernumeration of the 1953 population of 0.7&#13;
percent (ibid:3). The 1963 ralte was calculated after adjusting registered&#13;
births for 2 percent underregistratiorn. This figure was estimated by the U.S.&#13;
Bureau of the Census "by assuming a continuous rate of improvement between the&#13;
official estimates of underregistration in 1953 (12 percent) and in 1967 (1&#13;
percent)." The denominator of the 1963 rate was obtained by, i.a., adjusting&#13;
the 1963 enumerated population for a ret undercount of 1 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
The quinquennial birth rates shown above indicate a decline of 10&#13;
percent between 1951-55 and 1961-65. Wright's data for 1953 and 1963&#13;
represent a drop of 12 percent. The data presented by the U.S. Bureau of the&#13;
Census imply a 20 percent fall between 1953 and 1963.&#13;
Using the data reported in Table 21, the crude birth rate fell 25&#13;
percent between 1960 and 1974, from 36.6 to 27.5. Between 1974 and 1980 it&#13;
levelled off around 28.&#13;
Wright (1968:746) also reports a decline of 11 percent in the&#13;
general fertility rate from 189 in 1953 to 169 in 1963, noting however that&#13;
the exclusion in 1963 of 1,370 births to women of unknown age "tends to&#13;
depress the figures for 1963 and slightly exaggerate the fertility change over&#13;
the decade." The least change is reported for the total fertility rate by&#13;
both Newlon (1983:140) and Wright (1968:746), a drop of only 5 percent, from&#13;
5.32 to 5.04. The rates are apparently unadjusted. There is a report,&#13;
however, of a TFR of 5.5 in 1960, after which the TFR fell fairly steadily&#13;
until the mid-1970s; thereafter it appears to have fluctuated between 3.4 and&#13;
3.7 (Table 21).&#13;
II. Explanations of the trend&#13;
A. Changes in the crude birth rate&#13;
The TFR, according to these data, dropped 39 percent between 1960&#13;
and 1974, from 5.50 to 3.36, considerably more than the 25 percent drop in the&#13;
crude birth rate. This implies that there were changes in the age structure&#13;
of the population which counteracted the decline in the age-specific birth&#13;
rates. There appears to have been no change in the proportion (.204) of women&#13;
aged 15-44 years (i.e., the childbearing years) in the total population&#13;

- 69 -&#13;
between 1953 and 1963. Hence, the decline during that period in the crude&#13;
birth rate is accounted for by the decline in the rate at which women of this&#13;
age gave birth, from about 190 births per thousand women to about 169 (Sri&#13;
Lanka 1974: Table 2.3). Thereafter, however, the relative number in the&#13;
population of women aged 15-44 increased steadily and substantially until 1981&#13;
(latest year for which information was obtained). According to Fernando&#13;
(1980: Table 2), this proportion rose from 20.4 in 1963 to 21.6 in 1971 and&#13;
then to 22.8 in 1975 (WFS data). Using the female birth cohort data in the&#13;
1971 Census, Fernando projected that the proportion would reach 25.0 by&#13;
1981. He ignored mortality, however; hence, the actual figure should be&#13;
smaller, perhaps around 24 percent. Namboodiri, et al. (1983: Table 2.5)&#13;
present data showing that 47.9 percent of all females were aged 15-44 in&#13;
1981. Among males, the comparable percentage was 47.1 percent. If the number&#13;
of males and females in the population were similar in 1981, then the&#13;
percentage of women aged 15-44 in the total population would be a bit more&#13;
than half of the 47.9 percent indicated above, or about 24 percent. In any&#13;
case, whatever the precise numbers may be, it seems clear that the relative&#13;
number of women of reproductive age rose steadily beginning in the early&#13;
1960s.&#13;
It follows that if there had been no decline in the ASBR, the crude&#13;
birth rate would have increased. But, as indicated by the large drop of 39&#13;
percent in the TFR between 1960 and 1974, the ASBR declined quite&#13;
substantially. As Table 22 reveals, there were large declines up to 1974 at&#13;
the ages with the highest ASBR, 20-39. These ASBRs accounted for 90 percent&#13;
of the TFR during this period. Of the decline in the TFR, they accounted for&#13;
86 percent between 1963 and 1970 and for 99 percent between 1970 and 1974.&#13;
The table also shows the considerable reversal that took place after 1974,&#13;
particularly among women 20-29 years of age in the period 1978-80.&#13;

B. Changes in the age-specific birth rates&#13;
In a country like Sri Lanka, where there is little out of wedlock&#13;
fertility, changes in the ASBR are determined essentially by the proportions&#13;
married, the age at marriage, and marital fertility. Table 23 shows a steady&#13;
decline of considerable magnitude in the percentage of women currently married&#13;
from 1953 to 1975 among women under age 30. Among women 30-44 years old,&#13;
there were more modest declines between 1963 and 1975, especially during the&#13;
early 1970s. Similarly, the percentage of young women who had not yet married&#13;
increased considerably (Fernando 1980, Table 3). The figures for those age&#13;
15-19 and 20-24 were:&#13;
15-19          20-24&#13;
1953          75.7            32.5&#13;
1963          85.0            41.3&#13;
1971          89.4            53.2&#13;
1975          93.2            60.6&#13;
Such a strong trend in the postponement of marriage means that the&#13;
average age at marriage rose substantially. The female singulate mean age at&#13;
marriage (calculated from census or survey data on the percentages never&#13;
married in the various ages from 15 to 50) increased from 20.8 to 24.8 between&#13;
1953 and 1975 (Namboodiri et al. 1983:36).&#13;
These large changes in the propensity to marry account for much of&#13;
the decline in the TFR (which is a summary measure of the ASBR). As shown in&#13;
Table 24, Alam and Cleland (1981:27) estimate that the changes in nuptiality&#13;
during the period 1963-71 accounted for 59 percent of the 21 percent drop in&#13;
marital fertility rates. During the early 1970s, the changes in nuptiality&#13;
accounted for a somewhat smaller (but still large) part (46 percent) of the 11&#13;
percent decline in the TFR.&#13;

Alam and Cleland (1981:42) conclude that "Sri Lanka has followed the&#13;
typical Asian pattern of fertility decline. Initially changes in total&#13;
fertility were caused largely or exclusively by rising age at marriage; this&#13;
was followed by a period in which the effects of nuptiality and marital&#13;
fertility were about equal, and finally the contribution of marital fertility&#13;
became more important."&#13;

During the late 1970s, however, the decline in the percent married&#13;
was reversed, with (according to the data in Table 23) notable increases among&#13;
women under age 25. Registration data on first marriages may provide more&#13;
specific information on the timing of the change. During the period 1979-81,&#13;
there were about 120,000 first marriages per year, which was almost 30 percent&#13;
greater than the annual average of 93,000 in the two-year period 1974-75.&#13;
Half of this increase occurred, however, by 1976-77 (Sri Lanka 1983a:43). As&#13;
will be described more fully later, economic conditions improved greatly&#13;
during the 1978-81 period. To judge from these data on first marriages, it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
would appear that they can account for no more than half of the increase in&#13;
nuptiality which took place during the late 1970s. There are' two weaknesses&#13;
in these marriage data. They are tabulated by date of registration rather&#13;
than date of occurrence, and they are judged to be less than 90 percent&#13;
complete (United Nations 1984, Table 25). Hence, the need for caution in&#13;
using them. They are more defective, however, for estimating the volume than&#13;
the trend oE marriage. Over a short period, in particular, there is not&#13;
;likely to be much variation in the extent of delayed registration and of&#13;
under-registration. The changes in the number of registered marriages over as&#13;
short an interval as those being examined in this case are likely, therefore,&#13;
l:o provide a reliable indication of the direction of change. Hence, the&#13;
reversal of the decline in the percent married can be taken t:o be confirmed by&#13;
these data on the registration of first marriages. One may, however, be less&#13;
confident in using them to measure the pace or timing of change.&#13;
Consequently, how much of the change occurred prior to 1978 is more uncertain.&#13;
One can see that the decline in nuptiality was only a bit greater&#13;
during the early 1970s than between 1963 and 1970. The decli,ne in marital&#13;
Eertility, however, was considerably greater during the early 1970s than&#13;
during the preceding periocl (Table 25). This is the reason fIor the shift in&#13;
che relative importance of the changes in nuptiality and in rnarital fertility&#13;
rates in accounting for the declines in the TFR during these two periods&#13;
(Table 24).&#13;
The marital fertility data for the late 1970s are more difficult to&#13;
interpret, especially the disaggregation of the 1974-81 period into two parts,&#13;
up to 1978 and subsequently. The changes in marital fertility are not in the&#13;
same direction at all ages.. Even more puzzling is the shift in the direction&#13;
of the changes in three of the seven age categories (15-19, 40-44, and 45-49)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
from 1974-78 to 1978-80. At least part of the reason for this may errors or&#13;
elements of noncomparability involved in the surveys from which the data for&#13;
1974, 1978, and 1981 were obtained. The 1974 data were gathered in the 1975&#13;
survey, which was one of the many national World Fertility Surveys. The 1978&#13;
data were gathered in 1979 in a survey sponsored by the World Bank. And the&#13;
1981 data were obtained in the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey conducted in&#13;
1982. There has been no careful analysis of the comparability of these&#13;
surveys (at least for the purpose of measuring the changes in nuptiality and&#13;
fertility) and of the relative quality of the data they provide. Thus, it is&#13;
not possible to estimate how much of the odd pattern of apparent changes&#13;
reflects problems of measurement and how much reflects real change.&#13;
Keeping in mind the need for caution, let us look nevertheless at&#13;
the data shown in Table 25. As noted above, the marked economic improvement&#13;
in the period 1978-81 could account for some of the increase in the percent&#13;
married, especially among women under age 30, shown in Table 22. It could&#13;
also have led to an increase in marital fertility, especially among young&#13;
women. The data in Table 25, however, show a decline in marital fertility&#13;
among wives aged 15-19 during the period 1978-81 as well as 1974-78. On the&#13;
other hand, the fertility of wives 20-34 years old did increase, though not by&#13;
much among those aged 30-34. Furthermore, while the increase during 1978-81&#13;
reversed a decline during 1974-78 among wives aged 20-24, the increase during&#13;
the later period among wives age 25-34 was a continuation of an increase which&#13;
had apparently already taken place during the preceding interval. Similar&#13;
puzzles are evident in the changes that took place among wives aged 35-49. It&#13;
is difficult, therefore, to come to even a tentative conclusion about marital&#13;
fertility during the late 1970s.&#13;

C. Changes in marital fertility&#13;
Marital fertility is determined by the number and sex of children&#13;
couples want and their ability to control fertility to achieve those&#13;
preferences through the use of abortion, contraception and sterilization. In&#13;
addition, breastfeeding practices are a significant factor.&#13;
1. Family size preferences&#13;
We could find no data prior to those obtained in the World Fertility&#13;
Survey (WFS) conducted in 1975. The Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (CPS) of&#13;
1982 also gathered preference data. Unfortunately, preferences were not&#13;
measured in a comparable way in these two surveys; hence, one cannot judge&#13;
whether any significant change occurred between 1975 and 1982.&#13;
In 1975, one of the preference questions the respondents were asked&#13;
was: "If you could choose exactly the total number of children to have in your&#13;
whole life, what would the number be?" (Sri Lanka 1983a:49). The tabulations&#13;
of the responses to that question are shown in Table 26. In 1982 (CPS),&#13;
however, the respondents were asked: "If a couple starts their family now, how&#13;
many children do you feel is best for them to have?" (Sri Lanka 1983a:49). In&#13;
addition, the respondents were asked how many live births they had and whether&#13;
they "want to have children in the future?" (Sri Lanka 1983a:110-112). In&#13;
presenting the results shown in Table 26, the CPS analysts added together the&#13;
number of living children and the number of additional children stated in&#13;
response to these questions. Table 26 also shows the response to the question&#13;
about the "best" number of children.&#13;
Each of the three measures of preference is influenced by the number&#13;
of living children. (The positive association with mother's age probably&#13;
reflects the association with the number of living children.) However, the&#13;
association with the "best" number is much weaker than the association with&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the other two measures. Except for wives 45-49 and those with 5 or more&#13;
children, the mean number in each category does not vary by more than 0.2 from&#13;
the mean of 2.8 for all wives. Furthermore, other data indicate a similarly&#13;
small variation among different sub-groups in the population (Sri Lanka&#13;
1983a:50-52). "Thus, there appears [to be] evidence of a widely-held norm&#13;
about the number of children a family should have" (Sri Lanka 1983a:52).&#13;
As for the other two measures, if they were comparable, one might&#13;
conclude that they reveal some decline in the number wanted between 1975 and&#13;
1982, except among women over age 40 or with 4 or more children. As noted&#13;
above, however, they are not comparable. Not only did the context and the&#13;
language differ, the CPS measure of preference shown in Table 26 could be no&#13;
smaller than the number of children already alive, whereas there was no such&#13;
floor for the WPS question.&#13;
Finally, there seems to be no pronounced sex preference, as judged&#13;
by the results obtained in the WFS. (No data on sex preferences were gathered&#13;
in the CPS.) Pullum (1981:29), after analyzing the WFS data, concluded that&#13;
"in Sri Lanka as a whole, and in nearly all socio-economic subgroups, the only&#13;
significant sex preference is for balance interpreted very broadly as at least&#13;
one child of each sex."&#13;
2. Breastfeeding&#13;
The only information found on breastfeeding in Sri Lanka came from&#13;
the WFS (1975). Virtually all (96 percent) of the children born in the three&#13;
years preceding the survey were nursed. And the mean duration of the&#13;
breastfeeding of these children was a long 21 months (Kent 1981, Table 1 and&#13;
Figure 4). Of all ever-married women aged 12-49 with two or more live births,&#13;
or one birth and a current pregnancy, the mean length of nursing was 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
months, with the length varying positively with the age of these women, as&#13;
follows (Sri Lanka 1978:139):&#13;
Age                     Mean number of months&#13;
Less than 25                         14.2&#13;
25-34                            16.0&#13;
35-44                            17.6&#13;
45-49                            19.4&#13;
Mothers 45-49 years old were twice as likely to report nursing for at least&#13;
two years as mothers less than 25 years of age (40 percent versus 21 percent).&#13;
"This pattern probably reflects a historical decline in the&#13;
popularity of prolonged breastfeeding, though no trend towards exclusive&#13;
reliance on lbottle-feeding is discernible" (Sri Lanka 1978:141). A decline&#13;
would, of course, tend to increase the probability of conception, and, other&#13;
things equal, the number of children born. If a decline in the duration of&#13;
breastfeeding occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, it would have had an effect&#13;
on marital feartility contrary to the increase in the use of birth control.&#13;
Without reliable trend data on the duration of breastfeeding, however, the&#13;
impact of such a decline cannot be measured for either the period of fertility&#13;
decline (up to about 1974) or the subsequent period in which fertility&#13;
stalled.&#13;
During the stall, a continued decline in breastfeeding would have&#13;
tended to ofiEset any fertility-depressing facors. If the decline were&#13;
substantial, the impact would have been considerable. Interestingly, on the&#13;
basis of theoretical calculations, Lt was concluded that if the mean length of&#13;
lactational amenorrhea in Sri Lanka declined from 14 months to six months, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
order to prevent an increase in the total marital fertility rate the level of&#13;
contraceptive use would have had to increase from 35 percent to 54 percent&#13;
(McCann et al. 1981, Table 2). As we will see later, there was such an&#13;
increase in Sri Lanka between 1975 and 1982 (CPS). Hence, if a decline in the&#13;
mean length of nursing between 1975 and 1982 from 14 to 6 months actually&#13;
occurred, then it would have been offset by the increase in contraceptive use&#13;
which did in fact occur. The available data on trends in marital fertility&#13;
(Table 25) indicate that there was little change in the total marital&#13;
fertility rate of wives 20-49 years old between 1974 and 1981. Given the&#13;
observed increase in contraceptive use, this stall in marital fertility seems&#13;
to imply a decline in the mean duration of breastfeeding of approximately the&#13;
magnitude indicated above, i.e., from 14 months to about 6 months between 1975&#13;
and 1982. Such a decline, however, would represent a sharp acceleration of&#13;
the decline inferred from the age data shown above.&#13;
3. Family planning&#13;
Family planning activities started in Sri Lanka prior to 1953, when&#13;
the Family Planning Association (FPA) was established. The government&#13;
supported the FPA financially and through a bilateral agreement with the&#13;
government of Sweden for a pilot project, which showed that birth control was&#13;
feasible. In 1965, family planning became a part of the Department of Health&#13;
Services. In 1968, a Family Planning Bureau (subsequently named the Family&#13;
Health Bureau) was set up within the Ministry of Health (subsequently the&#13;
Ministry of Family Health). An agreement was entered into with the United&#13;
Nations Fund for Population Activities in 1973 for assistance to family&#13;
planning activities. The new government of 1977 committed itself to a&#13;
vigorous family planning program in order, i.a., to reduce the high rate of&#13;
population growth. As a result of a 1980 seminar on Population and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
Development, family planning was supported in a nonpartisan way by the&#13;
counitry's major political parties. In addition, monetary and other incentives&#13;
were increased for acceptors of sterilization, which had declined severely&#13;
from its preeminent position among the modern methods of contraception in 1974&#13;
and 1975, and for the medical teams performing them. Also, the income tax&#13;
laws were to be amended to eliminate deductions for children (Sri Lanka,&#13;
1983a:6-7 and Namboodiri et. al.: 12-14 and 310-311). The result was a&#13;
substantial strengthening of the famiily planning program. Mauldin and Lapham&#13;
(1984: Table 2) rated the strength of the program as moderate in 1972 but&#13;
strong in 1982.&#13;
4. Knowledge of contraception&#13;
The WFS found a very high level of knowledge in 1975.    Ninety one&#13;
percent of the respondents had heard of at least one method. In 1982 the CPS&#13;
found that 99 percent knew at least one method. Thus, by the mid 1970s almost&#13;
all women had some knowledge cf contraceptive methods. However, the&#13;
perc:entage of respondents who knew specific methods varied considerably by&#13;
method, especially in 1975.   About 80 percent knew of the pill and female&#13;
sterilization, 62 percent the IUD, and 51 percent the condom, with smaller&#13;
percentages for the other methods.   By 1982, all the percentages had increased&#13;
considerably, with knowledge of female sterilization virtually universal (98&#13;
percent) and oE the pill nearly so (90 percent).    Knowledge of rhythm and&#13;
withdrawal, particularly the latter, were the most limited (60 percent for&#13;
rhythm and 34 lpercent for withdrawal in 1982). Perhaps it is mare accurate to&#13;
say that these were the percentages willing to say they knew these methods.&#13;
Virtually none of the respondents, for example, acknowledged withdrawal&#13;
sporntaneously in either the WFS or the CPS. It was only after prompting&#13;
(i.e., being asked if they had heard of or knew of withdrawal) that almost all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
positive responses occurred. In general, the unprompted percentages exceeded&#13;
the prompted percentage only for the more effective methods (pill, IUD, and&#13;
female sterilization), except for male sterilization (Sri Lanka 1983a: 53-&#13;
54).&#13;
Knowledge was already fairly widespread throughout Sri Lanka in&#13;
1975. But the increase in knowledge between 1975 and 1982 reduced the sub-&#13;
group variability considerably. For example, whereas practically all of those&#13;
with at least a secondary level of education knew of at least one method in&#13;
both 1975 and 1982, among those with no schooling, the percentage increased&#13;
from 82 to 98 percent. Thus, the positive association between knowledge of at&#13;
least one method and education observed in 1975 disappeared by 1982. With&#13;
respect to knowledge of specific methods, however, there was still a definite&#13;
positive association with education in 1982 for all methods except female&#13;
sterilization, which was known to virtually all respondents, whatever their&#13;
level of education (Sri Lanka, 1983a:61).&#13;
5. The acceptance and availability of contraception&#13;
The use of contraception was apparently accepted by a very large&#13;
majority of couples in Sri Lanka in 1975. A further increase in its&#13;
acceptability seems to have occurred by 1982, at which time opposition to its&#13;
use appears to have virtually disappeared. In the WFS, those who said they&#13;
never had used contraception were asked why not. Less than 7 percent (6.8)&#13;
said they disapproved of family planning. Among the 1,245 respondents who&#13;
said they wanted no more children but who had never used contraception, 10.3&#13;
percent said they disapproved of family planning and another 10.8 percent said&#13;
their husbands opposed the use of any method (Immerwahr, 1981:23). In the&#13;
CPS, of currently married women who are not pregnant but not using a method,&#13;
less than 2 percent (1.6) expressed disapproval of family planning. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-. 84 -&#13;
percentage was virtually nil aLmong respondents under age 25, and the largest&#13;
percentage at any age was 4.7 percent, among women aged 40-44 (Sri Lanka,&#13;
1983a:81).&#13;
Turning to the availability of family planning services and&#13;
supplies, the long-run trend saw a large increase. But whether and how the&#13;
pace of increase varied during the period of fertility decline is difficult to&#13;
ascertain. And whether there was a levelling off or a reversal of the trend&#13;
during the late 1970s, when fertility stalled, is also hard to detect. The&#13;
only detailed data we found are from the CPS (1982).   Because of the neglect&#13;
of this matter in previous surveys and its importance to the delivery of&#13;
family planning services and supplies, it received considerable attention in&#13;
the CPS.  Information was collected on the respondent's knowledge of a source&#13;
of specific melthods, distance, mode of travel and travel time to sources, and&#13;
the conveniences of obtaining services.&#13;
Sincie the lack of trend data precludes any chance of assessing&#13;
whether a change in availability played a part in causing the fertility stall,&#13;
only a summary of the main findings of the CPS are presented (Sri Lanka,&#13;
1983a:95-96 and Chapter 7). Almost all non-users of contraceptives knew of a&#13;
source of at least one modern method. For specific methods, awareness of a&#13;
source was greater for the better-educated, urban, and non-working women. The&#13;
less well-known the specific method, the less well-known was its source.   The&#13;
largest source of supply by far was the government. Four of every five women&#13;
currently using a method obtained it from a government source. Female&#13;
sterilization and the IUD were supplied almost solely by the government.&#13;
Twernty four percent of male sterilization and half of injectables were&#13;
supplied by private sources. Non-program sources (commercial outlets and&#13;
places of work) supplied 85 percent of condoms and about a third of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
pills. In general, private (mostly FPA) and non-program sources each served&#13;
about 10 percent of current users. Non-government sources were used more&#13;
often by the urban and better-educated women.&#13;
Convenience of obtaining contraceptive supplies and services was&#13;
method specific. Condoms and the pill were the methods most easily&#13;
obtainable. Well over half of the users could get them from a source either&#13;
within walking distance or within thirty minutes of travel time.&#13;
Interestingly, though by 1982 female sterilization was the most popular single&#13;
method used, it was also the least convenient to obtain. One third of its&#13;
users said it was inconvenient to get, and a majority of them said it required&#13;
more than an hour of travelling to reach a place that provided it. The latter&#13;
differed greatly, however, for rural and urban women. Only 19 percent of the&#13;
urban users said that travel time to a source required more than an hour,&#13;
whereas 59 percent or rural users reported such a lengthy journey (Sri Lanka,&#13;
1983a:91).&#13;
Does a lengthier trip reduce use of female sterilization? If it&#13;
does, then the percentage of rural women using female sterilization should be&#13;
considerably smaller than the percentage of urban women doing so. And the&#13;
percentage of both urban and rural women who have been contraceptively&#13;
sterilized should be greater, the shorter the length of reported travel&#13;
time. Surprisingly, however, as shown in Table 27, there is virtually no&#13;
difference in the percentage of rural women who have been contraceptively&#13;
sterilized (18.1 percent) and the percentage of rural women (17.6 percent).&#13;
Moreover, the prevalence of contraceptive sterilization among both urban and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
rural women i; larger (not smaller), the longer the travel time. The&#13;
association i; not strong, but it is definite. Why this is the case is&#13;
unclear.&#13;

Note:     The number of women reporting specified travel times are shown in&#13;
parentheses. These numbers are the bases for the percentages shown. Thus,&#13;
for example, 16.2 percent of the 599 urban wives who reported a travel time of&#13;
less than 30 minutes reported themseLves as contraceptively sterilized.&#13;
Source: Sri Lanka 1983a; calculated from the data presented in Tables 7.4,&#13;
7.8, and 7.9.&#13;
It can also be seen, however, that the prevalence of contraceptive&#13;
sterilization is slightly greater among urban than rural wives within each&#13;
travel-time category. But 63 percent (599/947) of urban wives reported a&#13;
travel time of less than 30 minutes, whereas only 25 percent (751/2,997) of&#13;
rural wives did so. On the cither hand, 49 percent of the latter travelled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
over an hour, as compared to only 13 percent of the former. Thus, the longer&#13;
travel times of the rural wives more than compensated for their slightly lower&#13;
prevalence of contraceptive sterilization.&#13;
These data are a puzzle. On their face, they seem to suggest that&#13;
the use of contraceptive sterilization can be increased somewhat by increasing&#13;
the length of time it takes to get to clinics providing this service. Before&#13;
coming to such a paradoxical conclusion, however, it would be advisable to&#13;
study this relationship more fully than done here. If it is the result, e.g.,&#13;
of selective processes, then these need to be ascertained before sensible&#13;
policy conclusions can be drawn.&#13;
6. The use of contraception&#13;
As noted above, family planning was made a part of the activities of&#13;
the Department of Health Services in 1965. Then the Family Planning Bureau&#13;
(later called the Family Health Bureau) was created in 1968. The emphasis at&#13;
first was on the use of IUDs (Table 28). During the late 1960s, the emphasis&#13;
shifted to the pill, and by 1969 the number of new pill acceptors reported by&#13;
the Bureau exceeded the total of the new acceptors of the IUD and&#13;
sterilization. The IUD seems to have made a comeback beginning in the early&#13;
1970s, only to decline again, along with the pill, after 1975. Meanwhile,&#13;
sterilization appears to have experienced alternating waves of popularity, at&#13;
first from 1973 through 1976 and then around 1980. The accuracy of the counts&#13;
in Table 28 is questionable. Immerwahr (1981:21-22), after comparing the&#13;
Family Health Bureau data on acceptors and WFS data, concluded that the Bureau&#13;
underreported sterilizations and overreported acceptances of the pill and the&#13;
IUD. The latter occurred, he conjectured, by counting subsequent acceptances&#13;
by women who expelled IUD or discontinued the pill for a while. Thus, the&#13;
relative use of sterilization is greater than that shown in the table. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
data may still be useful, however, as an indication of the ebb and flow of the&#13;
use of these methods. This would be the case if the error in the acceptor&#13;
counts were fairLy constant over the years. Whether or not this is the case&#13;
is not known.&#13;

It may be noted, however, that the sharp jump in sterilizations&#13;
around 1980 shown in the tabLe came after the increase in incentive payments&#13;
to acceptors and in compensation to medical personnel performing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
procedure, which was part of the efforts of the government that took office in&#13;
1977 to give higher priority to family planning. (In accounting for the sharp&#13;
fall in sterilization in the years 1977-78, Immerwahr (1981:37) noted that&#13;
"the decline was apparently due to various administrative and political&#13;
reasons rather than to a decrease in demand.") Similarly, the reported surge&#13;
in sterilization in 1973 and 1974 may be related to the assistance obtained&#13;
from the UNFPA beginning in 1973, part of which included provision for&#13;
surgical facilities for sterilization (Immerwahr, 1981:14). Finally, the data&#13;
in Table 28 are roughly consistent with the data in Tables 24 and 25 showing a&#13;
decline in marital fertility during the 1960s (after 1963), an increase in the&#13;
pace of this decline during the early 1970s, and then a levelling off during&#13;
the late 1970s.&#13;
Data on acceptance, however, may be deceptive as an indication of&#13;
use. They need to be supplemented, therefore, by data on use. Such data are&#13;
available from the WFS (1975) and CPS (1982).&#13;
As shown in Table 29, the percent of wives 15-49 years old currently&#13;
using contraception seems to have increased from 32 to 55 percent between 1975&#13;
and 1982, a gain of 23 percentage points. Thus, the prevalence of&#13;
contraceptive use was apparently 72 percent greater (55/32) in 1982 than in&#13;
1975. It must be noted, however, that the measures of current use were&#13;
somewhat different in the CPS than in the WFS. "Current" use meant at the&#13;
time of the survey in 1975. In 1982, however, it meant use during the month&#13;
preceding the survey (Sri Lanka, 1983a:70). Furthermore, with respect to the&#13;
use of specific methods, there were other differences in measurement which&#13;
reduce the comparability of the results of the two surveys. Abstinence, for&#13;
example, was listed as a specific method in 1975 but not in 1982. It was&#13;
recorded as a method by the interviewer in 1982 only if the respondent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
mentioned it without prompting. Such a procedure may well have been the&#13;
reason for the lower reported use! of abstinence in 1982 than in 1975 (Sri&#13;
Lanka, 1983a:67).   Thus, the results of the two surveys are not strictly&#13;
comparable, obviating precise measurement of any change. The differences in&#13;
the measures of current use are not so great, however, as to preclude taking&#13;
the results; as an indication of the direction and approximate magnitude of&#13;
change. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that there was&lt; a very large&#13;
increase in contraceptive use between 1975 and 1982 with the prevalence of use&#13;
probably rising more than 50 percent.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Turning to changes in the kind of method used, the first thing to&#13;
note is that the percentage-point increase in the use of traditional methods&#13;
(withdrawal, rhythm, and other traditional methods) was about as great as the&#13;
increase in the use of the modern methods. Since the prevalence of use of&#13;
traditional methods was lower in 1975 than that of modern methods (13.2 vs.&#13;
18.8 percent), the approximately equivalent percentage-point increase means&#13;
that the gain was proportionately greater for traditional than for modern&#13;
methods (24.5/13.2 = 86 percent for traditional methods and 30.4/18.8 = 62&#13;
percent for modern methods).&#13;
The greatest increase was in female sterilization, the prevalence of&#13;
which nearly doubled, increasing from 9.2 to 17.0 percent. The next largest&#13;
gain was in the use of rhythm, from 8 to 13 percent. Other notable increases&#13;
occurred in the use of male sterilization (3.0 percentage points, but the&#13;
largest relative gain by far, 3.7/0.7 = 529 percent), withdrawal (from 1.5 to&#13;
4.7 percent), and "other traditional methods" (from 3.7 to 6.8 percent). The&#13;
IUD was the only method (of those specifically identified in the table) which&#13;
lost ground.&#13;
Female sterilization was the most prevalent method in both 1975 and&#13;
1982, with rhythm not far behind in popularity. Rhythm was the most popular&#13;
method in 1982 among wives under age 25 and those with less than three&#13;
children (Sri Lanka, 1983a:71). Traditional methods as a whole were more&#13;
popular than all modern methods combined in 1982 among wives under age 25 and&#13;
those with less than three living children (Sri Lanka, 1983a:76-77). One&#13;
interpretation of these differentials is that married women in Sri Lanka tend&#13;
to use traditional methods (especially rhythm) in the early years of their&#13;
marriage, but as the number of their living children increases they switch to&#13;
modern methods, with female sterilization predominating. WFS data presented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
Ln Immerwahr (1981:19) support this interpretation. The age-specific figures&#13;
ifor the two leading methods in 1982 were (Sri Lanka, 1983a:72):&#13;

20-24              7.4                   30.0&#13;

35-39            41.6                    20.0&#13;
40-44             40.6                   22.9&#13;
45-49             39.7                   22.4&#13;
In addition to the shift from rhythm to sterilization as age&#13;
advances, two other points deserve mention. One is that proportion of married&#13;
contraceptors using rhythm did not vary much by age (the range is 20.0-31.7),&#13;
with 20-25 percent of older married contraceptors using this method. The&#13;
other point is that the percent of married contraceptors relying on female&#13;
sterilization was significant (23 percent) as early as age 25-29 years.&#13;
There is more direct evidence of method shifting, and it reveals&#13;
that method changes have been extensive (Sri Lanka, 1983a:75). Almost half&#13;
(48 percent) of married contraceptors had used some other method in the past&#13;
than the one currently used. Those currently using a modern method had&#13;
changed somewhat more often than those currently using a traditional method&#13;
(53 versus 42 percent). But the relative frequency of shifting was the same&#13;
for those currently using modern methods as for those currently using&#13;
traditional methods. In each case!, 29 percent of the current users had&#13;
switched from the other type of method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
The distinction between modern and traditional methods is&#13;
significant because the latter are generally less effective. The difference&#13;
in effectiveness, however, may vary by education. Rhythm, for example, may be&#13;
practiced more carefully (and hence more effectively) by couples who are&#13;
better educated. It is notable, therefore, that among married contraceptors&#13;
in Sri Lanka in 1982 the percentage using traditional methods was positively&#13;
associated with education, whereas this was not the case for the use of the&#13;
modern methods, as the following data show (Sri Lanka, 1983a:77).&#13;
Modern          Traditional&#13;
Level of education         methods          methods&#13;
No schooling                27.7              16.3&#13;
Primary                     31.5             20.9&#13;
Secondary or more           30.5             29.1&#13;
All wives                   30.4             24.5&#13;
This relationship is particularly significant, since there is a high level of&#13;
education in Sri Lanka. Of the 4,500 ever-married respondents in the CPS, 50&#13;
percent had at least some secondary education and another 35 percent had a&#13;
primary school education (Sri Lanka, 1983a:24). Ninety three percent of the&#13;
4,500 ever-married women were currently married; hence, the education&#13;
distribution of the latter group must be essentially the same as that for the&#13;
former group.&#13;
WFS data provide some indication of the trend in the use of the most&#13;
effective contraceptive methods prior to 1975. As one can see in Table 30,&#13;
there seems to have been little use of such methods prior to 1965. The&#13;
percentage that began to use these methods increased during the late 1960s.&#13;
The pace of initial use continued to accelerate through the early 1970s. This&#13;
trend of accelerating adoption of effective contraception was more pronounced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
for contraceptive sterilization than for the other effective methods.      The&#13;
data presented in Table 29, comparing the WFS and the CPS results, indicate&#13;
that the adoption of contraceptive sterilization accelerated between 1975 and&#13;
1982, but that the increases during this period in the prevalence of use of&#13;
the pill and the condom were offset by the decline in the prevalence of use of&#13;
the IUD. Table 28 suggests that the large increase in the prevalence of&#13;
contraceptive sterilization between 1975 and 1982 was the net result of a&#13;
sharp drop in the adoption of this method between 1975 and 1979, followed by a&#13;
massive increase in its adoption in 1980 and 1981.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
The indications of an accelerating adoption of modern means of&#13;
contraception are consistent with the evidence of an accelerating fall in the&#13;
TMFR and the TFR during the 1960s and early 1970s:&#13;
TFR                 TMFR&#13;
(ages 20-49)&#13;
1963          5.04                 6.23&#13;
1970          4.23                 5.92&#13;
1974          3.36                 4.93&#13;
1981          3.71                 5.08&#13;
1970/63        .84                  .95&#13;
1974/70         .79                 .83&#13;
1981/74       1.10                 1.03&#13;
They are not consistent, however, with the reversal of the fertility decline,&#13;
which occurred after 1974. The large increase in contraceptive use between&#13;
1975 and 1982, which occurred at all ages (Sri Lanka 1983a, Tables 6.2 and&#13;
6.6), should have worked to depress marital fertility at all ages. As Table&#13;
25 shows, however, it appears that marital fertility fell between 1974 and&#13;
1981 only among wives under age 20 and over age 35. In examining the data on&#13;
breastfeeding (above), a decline in its prevalence and duration up to 1975 was&#13;
inferred. Furthermore, the possibility of a continued, and perhaps even an&#13;
accelerated, decline was noted. Such a continued decline would, of course,&#13;
have tended to offset the effect of the large increase in contraceptive use&#13;
between 1975 and 1982. Unless, however, a decline in breastfeeding during the&#13;
late 1970s and early 1980s (if one took place) occurred predominantly among&#13;
women 20-34 years of age, it would not help to explain the observed&#13;
differences in the changes in the ASMFR. As for the increase in the TFR after&#13;
1974, the increase in nuptiality during this period (see Table 23), along with&#13;
the increase in the ASMFR at ages 25-34 and the absence of a decline at ages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
20-24, are enough to account for it. (The ASMFR are very high at ages 20-34,&#13;
and the ASFR at these ages accounted for about 70-75 percent of the TFR during&#13;
the late 1970s.)&#13;
7. Abortion&#13;
Aside from information about its legal status, virtually no&#13;
information about abortion in Sri Lanka was found.    Abortion in Sri Lanka is&#13;
legally permitted only to save a woman's life (Liskin, 1980:135). This, of&#13;
course, does not preclude illegal abortions, and Fernando (1974:455) observes&#13;
that "induced abortion is ... being resorted to for the prevention of births,&#13;
most of which are presumably illegitimate." But he does not provide an&#13;
estimate of its frequency.&#13;
D. Social and economic changes&#13;
Despite a respectable rate of growth of real income per capita (2.6&#13;
percent) during the 1960s and 1970s, Sri Lanka was still a low-income country&#13;
in the early 1980s (Table 31). It was also preponderantly rural and&#13;
agricultural.. It had, nevertheless, reached a fairly high level of&#13;
development in other important respects: education, the status of women, and&#13;
mortality. EBy the 1970s, a very large majority of the population was&#13;
literate; ancl, with enrollment in primary schools universal by about 1980, in&#13;
a few more decades everyone ~will be literate. Meanwhile, the increases in&#13;
literacy from the 1950s through the 1970s were swifter among women than men,&#13;
reducing the sex differential. By around 1980, women's literacy rate was less&#13;
than 10 percent lower than that of men. Similarly, women's life expectancy at&#13;

expectancy at birth was 6 percent greater than that of men. Finally, the&#13;
infant mortality rate, a widely used index of socioeconomic conditions,&#13;
declined great]y, from well over 100 infant deaths per thousand Ibirths during&#13;
the 1940s (Sri Lanka, 1974:27) to 71 around 1960 and then to 32 around 1980.&#13;
Although the latter figure is still considerably greater than the very low&#13;
rates (under 10) in a number of high--income countries, it is the lowest rate&#13;
among the low-income countries reported by the World Bank. In addition, there&#13;
was a fairly rapid increase in the labor force participation rate of women&#13;
20-44 years olcl between 1963 and 1971, from 27 to 37 percent (Namboodiri et&#13;
al. 1983:309).&#13;
The unubuuiiy LLI  l LIZVCL Ul ILUll4II UCVtLUjJIIItLL *11 a FU.JJrLaaL4 Lall&#13;
society has been the result of government welfare policies.    Since 1945,&#13;
education has been free to all, as was medical services until 1971, at which&#13;
time a nominal charge was instituted (Namboodiri, et al., 1983:308). In 1981,&#13;
the government allocated 13.7 percent of its expenditures to "housing and&#13;
community amenities [or] social security and welfare" (World Bank, 1984: Table&#13;
26). The average percentage for all low-income countries included in the&#13;
World Bank data was 5.0 percent: including China and India and 6.1 percent&#13;
excluding them. Sri Lanka's percentage is considerably greater than that for&#13;
any other low-income country in the table. It is also greater than that of&#13;
the preponderant majority of lower-middle-income countries shown in the table.&#13;
Other significant conditions are summarized by Namboodiri, et al.&#13;
(1983:309) in these words: "Mailthusian pressure on land is evident,&#13;
particularly in the wet zone; tnemployment is very high, even among the&#13;
educated; ... the country is linked to others far and near through&#13;
communications and transportation networks; Western ideas and life styles have&#13;
influenced the island for centuries ...; direct and indirect taxes and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
income transfer policies have served to redistribute income; the nation-state&#13;
serves as a source of insurance against penury, and as a source of support for&#13;
the ill and the aged--roles traditionally filled by one's children, and&#13;
finally, gender and class inequities have lessened over the years."&#13;
It appears, then, that the relatively high level of education in Sri&#13;
Lanka, the great decline in mortality, the equalization of opportunity and&#13;
condition, especially for women, social insurance, and the receptivity to&#13;
aspects of Western culture may have been among the chief determinants of the&#13;
decline in Sri Lanka's fertility, even in the face of little urbanization and&#13;
industrialization.&#13;
In this context, the rise in the age at marriage, which has been&#13;
identified as the main cause of the decline during the 1960s, has been&#13;
explained as the result of growing birth cohorts getting more education and&#13;
finding it difficult to obtain employment. "As a result of decreasing&#13;
employment opportunities in the non-farm sector and a low rate of absorption&#13;
in the farm sector, the age at marriage of males went up because families were&#13;
presumably guided by the rule that they should not let a son get married&#13;
before he is assured of a more or less permanent means of support" (Namboodiri&#13;
et al. 1983:314). Young women as well as young men were staying in school&#13;
longer, and the former were increasingly entering the labor force.&#13;
Consequently, the dependency period of children lengthened. They were&#13;
increasingly staying in school into their teens and they had to wait longer&#13;
for a job after leaving school.&#13;
Not only did these social and economic trends induce the age of&#13;
marriage to rise; they helped to motivate parents to want fewer children&#13;
because the longer dependency of children increased their net cost. Thus, as&#13;
family planning became increasingly available during the late 1960s and early&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
1970s, it was accepted.  Consequently, the decline in marital fertility&#13;
accelerated and became the main reason for the rapid decline of the TFR during&#13;
the early 1970s.&#13;
But why did fertility stall, subsequently? That is more difficult to&#13;
ascertain. Part of the answer seems to be, however, that economic conditions&#13;
improved greatly during the very late 1970s as a result of a major change in&#13;
economic policy introduced by the government which came into power in 1977.&#13;
As a result, domestic savings and foreign aid raised investment to a level&#13;
during the period 1978-81 twice as high as that during the period 1970-77&#13;
(Namboodiri et al. 1983:12), and real per capita GNP grew at a rate almost&#13;
three times as great as that during the preceding years of the 1970s and about&#13;
twice as great as that of the 1960s (Namboodiri et al. 1983:302). Under such&#13;
conditions marriage is more feasible. As Table 3 shows, during the period&#13;
1975-81 the percentage of women married increased, particularly among women&#13;
under age 25, reversing the decline which had taken place during the preceding&#13;
years. It would be helpful to have data on the percent married for 1978 so&#13;
that the changes during the period 1978-81 can be ascertained and compared to&#13;
those of the period 1975-77.  Unforturnately, such data are not available.  As&#13;
noted above, however, marriage registration data suggest that about half of&#13;
the rise in nuptiality during the period 1975-81 had occurred prior to 1978.&#13;
E. Summary&#13;
Despite having a low per capita income and being a predominantly&#13;
agrarian society, a substantiaL fertility decline occurred in Sri Lanka&#13;
between about the mid-1950s and the mid-1970s. A high level of social&#13;
development (in terms of mortaLity, social welfare, education, and the status&#13;
of women) and receptivity to aspects of Western culture seem to have supplied&#13;
the incentive to reduce the number of children born. The fertility decline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
was initially the result of a sharp fall in nuptiality. By the late 1960s,&#13;
however, couples began to accept increasingly the modern methods of&#13;
contraception which the national family planning program, established in the&#13;
1950s, was making available. As the use of these methods accelerated, the&#13;
decline in marital fertility also accelerated. As a result, the pace of&#13;
fertility decline was swifter during the early 1970s than it had been during&#13;
the 1960s, and the drop in marital fertility displaced rising nuptiality as&#13;
the main cause of fertility decline. Increases in the relative number of&#13;
women of childbearing age, however, acted to retard somewhat the fall of the&#13;
crude birth rate.&#13;
These is no evidence to indicate that abortion has been used to any&#13;
appreciable extent. There is, however, an indication that some reduction in&#13;
the long duration of breastfeeding practiced in Sri Lanka took place prior to&#13;
1975. Such a decline would tend to shorten birth intervals, enhancing&#13;
fertility, but no estimate of the magnitude of this effect is available.&#13;
Although a continuation of the decline of breastfeeding during the late 1970s&#13;
could have occurred, the available indirect evidence is too meager to provide&#13;
a reliable basis for judging what actually happened.&#13;
The reasons for the fertility stall of the late 1970s and very early&#13;
1980s are more difficult to identify. The national family planning program&#13;
became considerably more effective between 1972 and 1982, and the prevalence&#13;
of contraceptive use increased probably by more than 50 percent between 1975&#13;
and 1982. Much of this increase, however, was in the use of traditional&#13;
methods of contraception, which are generally less effective than the modern&#13;
methods. Nevertheless, it is less risky to use traditional methods than no&#13;
method at all. The large increase, therefore, in the use of both modern and&#13;
traditional methods between 1975 and 1982 should have tended to depress the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
age-specific marital fertility rates more than the available data indicate&#13;
they actually feLl. The available data may contain errors, or other changes&#13;
(such as a decline in the duration of breastfeeding) may have offset to some&#13;
extent the fertiLity depressing effect of the increased use of contraception.&#13;
The evidence is clearer, however, with respect to nuptiality. There&#13;
was a reversal during the period 1975-81 of the long-run decline in the&#13;
percentage of women married, with the increase especially pronounced among&#13;
women under age 25. Perhaps half of this rise in nuptiality began before&#13;
1978. The sharp improvement in economic conditions which occurred during the&#13;
period 1978-81 very likely strengthened the trend of increasing, nuptiality.&#13;

CONCLUSION&#13;
In this study of rapid fertility decline in Costa Rica, Korea, and&#13;
Sri Lanka, four stalls in the decline have been identified, two in Korea, and&#13;
one in each of the other two countries. Three of the stalls appear to be a&#13;
levelling off of the TFR and one a marked deceleration in its rate of&#13;
decline. There is reason to believe that stalls have occurred in other&#13;
countries also. Hence, though it is not clear just how widespread the&#13;
phenomenon is, it has been occurring often enough to warrant study of its&#13;
determinants and consequences. The focus of this study has been on its&#13;
determinants, but a few words may be said about its consequences.&#13;
The most obvious effect is on the birth rate and, via that effect,&#13;
on the age structure and the rate of natural increase. In this connection, a&#13;
major question is how long the stalls last. Of the four stalls observed in&#13;
this study, only one had ended as of the period 1980-82, the latest years for&#13;
which data were available at the time this study was done. That was in Korea&#13;
during the six-year period 1967-1972 inclusive, when the TFR remained almost&#13;
stationary in the range 4.2-4.4. The other three stalls began during the late&#13;
1970s and had not ended as of 1980-82, so their duration is unknown as yet.&#13;
But they had lasted at least five years (as of 1980) in Costa Rica, at least&#13;
seven years (as of 1982) in Korea, and at least eight years (as of 1981) in&#13;
Sri Lanka. A duration of at least five years was one of the criteria used in&#13;
defining a stall in this study, but periods significantly longer than that&#13;
have obviously occurred, and some of the durations may turn out to be at least&#13;
ten years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-. 104 -&#13;
This is not the appropriate place to specify the ramifications of a&#13;
stall's impact: on the age structure and the rate of natural increase.   But a&#13;
brief indication of just one of its implications may be helpful in indicating&#13;
its significance.  Population projections usually assume a smooth change&#13;
(often, a decline) in fertility (as well as the other components) until a&#13;
major turning point (a reversal or a levelling off) occurs. To the extent&#13;
that stalls occur, such an assumption will be incorrect, and the magnitude of&#13;
the error wilL be determined by (1) i:he gap between the projection's assumed&#13;
rate of change and that which actuaLLy occurs during the stall (which may be&#13;
positive or negative, but at a much slower rate than previously, as well as&#13;
zero) and (2) the duration of the stall. It follows that projections assuming&#13;
a smooth decline in fertility will underestimate i.a. the rate of population&#13;
growth, the size of the population and the proportion of the young in the&#13;
population in the countries experiencing a stall. And the projection based on&#13;
an assumption of a rapid decline in fertility will be particularly misleading,&#13;
especially if the stall lasts for a period closer to ten than to five years.&#13;
Taking stalls into account will require making difficult judgments about their&#13;
timing and duration, but given their existence, a projection based on a&#13;
fertility decline assumed to be interrupted by a stall needs to be added to&#13;
the set of population projections for high-fertility countries.&#13;
Turning to determinants, the most striking findings are that the&#13;
explanations of the stalls are partial and that they differ from one country&#13;
to the next. In Costa Rica, the explanation seems to be mainly that marital&#13;
fertility and contraceptive use levelled off, apparently as a result of (1) a&#13;
convergence between desired and actual fertility and (2) a weakening of the&#13;
family planning program, as the initial enthusiasm and political support&#13;
waned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
In Korea, at least some of the reasons for the near levelling off of&#13;
the TFR during the late 1960s seem to be evident. But the explanation for the&#13;
acceleration after 1975 is not. During the earlier period, an increase in&#13;
marriage among women 30-49 years old, as well as an increase in marital&#13;
fertility of those under age 30, offset declines in marriage among women 15-29&#13;
years old and in the marital fertility of women aged 30-49. The rise in the&#13;
marital fertility of younger women is accounted for by a sharp decrease in the&#13;
first three birth intervals, resulting from increases in premaritally&#13;
conceived first births (associated with a shift from arranged to romantic&#13;
marriages), declines in the duration of breastfeeding, and an apparently&#13;
growing desire to terminate childbearing early. The increase in contraceptive&#13;
use decelerated markedly during the late 1960s.&#13;
During the late 1970s in Korea, the marital fertility of women 25-29&#13;
years old increased a bit, reversing the moderate decline of the early&#13;
1970s. Among wives 30-34 years old, fertility continued to fall during the&#13;
late 1970s, but at less than half the rate of the early 1970s. By the late&#13;
1970s, childbearing had become so concentrated that almost half of the total&#13;
fertility rate was accounted for by the birth rate of women aged 25-29, and&#13;
about two-thirds by women aged 25-34. The increase in contraceptive use&#13;
decelerated during the late 1970s and early 1980s (especially the latter&#13;
period), after the acceleration of the early 1970s. But the reasons for these&#13;
changes have not been identified.&#13;
The explanation for the fertility stall during the late 1970s in Sri&#13;
Lanka is also quite limited. There was a large increase in contraceptive use&#13;
between 1975 and 1982. At least some of the fertility-depressing effect of&#13;
this increase was presumably offset by an increase in marriage, which seems to&#13;
have begun prior to 1978, when economic conditions improved considerably,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
apparently strengthening the rising trend of marriage. There may have been a&#13;
reduction also in the long duration of breastfeeding which has been practiced&#13;
in Sri Lanka (thereby tending to increase fertility), but the evidence is too&#13;
meager for one to be conficlent that such a decline actually occurred.&#13;
Because the expltnation of the stall seems to be simpler and clearer&#13;
in the case of Costa Rica than of Korea or Sri Lanka, it is easier to identify&#13;
in Costa Rica than in the other two countries what may be needed for the stall&#13;
to end. The key factor in Costa Rica appears to be the equilibrium of actual&#13;
and desired family size which the available evidence indicates took place&#13;
around the middle of the 1970s. Actual fertility could fall below desired&#13;
family size, but it is more likely that a further decline in fertility awaits&#13;
a decline in desired size. The available evidence about the determinants of&#13;
desired size in Costa Rica is very meager. What one finds in the literature&#13;
are theoretically based conjectures about the effects of social and economic&#13;
development. More evidence concerning the specific mechanisrns linking&#13;
development to changes in desired size would be helpful in accounting for the&#13;
past trend in fertility and for projecting its future course.    Short of that,&#13;
however, one may venture to speculate along the lines found in the&#13;
literature.  In that view, further substantial economic growth may be&#13;
critical. For such growth would permit continued expansion of education and&#13;
social welfare. Some of the consequences of such an expansion would be&#13;
increases in the aspirations for higher social and economic status, the labor&#13;
force participation of women, the dependency (and hence cost) of children (as&#13;
schooling lengthens), and the care! and financial support provided the elderly&#13;
via a combination of persomal savings, better health, communal care facilitiets&#13;
and services, and public and private pension programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
If desired size were to fall substantially below the level of the&#13;
late 1970s, than the status of the family planning program would be&#13;
relevant. What would renew the enthusiasm and political support that enabled&#13;
the NFPP to expand so vigorously for a number of years after its establishment&#13;
in 1968 before peaking out and then declining during the late 1970s? One&#13;
possibility is that with the hypothesized substantial decline in desired&#13;
family size, the resultant gap between actual and desired size would stimulate&#13;
a considerable increase in demand for family planning services and suppplies,&#13;
which i.a. could have an effect on the willingness of the leaders to support&#13;
the NFPP more vigorously than they seem to have done during the late 1970s.&#13;
The leaders also may be stimulted to take such action by a renewed sense of&#13;
concern about the deleterious effects of the country's continued high rate of&#13;
population growth. Though the birth rate dropped a lot between 1960 and 1975,&#13;
some of the decline was offset by a continued fall in the death rate.&#13;
Furthermore, the rate of population growth was so high in 1960 that, even with&#13;
a substantial decline during the next 15 years, the rate was still high in&#13;
1975.&#13;
Turning to Korea and Sri Lanka, since the causes of their stalls&#13;
seem to be more complex and less explicable than those in Costa Rica, one can&#13;
do little more than offer a few pertinent comments and queries. In both&#13;
countries, large declines in the percent married have played an important part&#13;
in bringing about the fall in fertility, and reversals in the decline in&#13;
marriage have contributed to the stalls. In both societies, celibacy is rare,&#13;
so the significant variable is the age at marriage. Given the large increase&#13;
in age at marriage that has already occurred, it seems unlikely that a further&#13;
significant rise will take place. But what about declines in age at&#13;
marriage? They have occurred, but apparently only temporarily or with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
relatively little effect.   Is the future prospect further fluctuation in age&#13;
at marriage around the currernt level, or a substantial decline"&#13;
There is evidence that breastfeeding has been declining in both&#13;
coantries.  But more detailed and precise measures of the extent and pace of&#13;
the declines, as well as their impact on fertility, are needed. The rapid&#13;
in:reases in contraceptive use in both countries, however, may reach such high&#13;
lerels (70 percent or more) in the near future as to reduce greatly the&#13;
po:ential impact of further cleclines in breastfeeding.&#13;
En Korea, but not in Sri Lanka, there is a marked preference for&#13;
sons. There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which son&#13;
preference is an obstacle to further fertility decline. With a TFR well below&#13;
three in the early 1980s (hence, not far above the replacement level of&#13;
fertility), the resolution of this issue would be particularly helpful in&#13;
judlging the pyrospects for ancL pace of a further decline in fertility.&#13;
In Sri Lanka, on the other hand, an impressively large proportion of&#13;
contraceptors continue to use rhythm and other traditional methods.     About&#13;
haLA of the lc;rge increase in contraceptive use from 1976 to 1982 resulted&#13;
from an increase in the use cif these methods.   What has been the effectiveness&#13;
of these methods in preventing pregnancies sand, given the virtual absence of&#13;
in(duced abortion, in preventing births) in Sri Lanka, in comparison with the&#13;
modern methods (pill, IUD, tLbal ligation, etc.)?    Also, why have so many Sri&#13;
Lankan women continued to adopt/use the traditional methods?    ALnswers to these&#13;
questions would oetter enable us to judge the likely future mix of methods and&#13;
the extent to which such a mix would enable women in Sri Lanka to control&#13;
their fertility.&#13;

stalis in fertility declines on the basis of this study in only three&#13;

countries, even if the explanations for the stalls were more complete and&#13;
better documented than is the case in this study. Nevertheless, the diversity&#13;
of the apparent reasons from one country to the other in this study suggests&#13;
that there may be few, if any, key factors, and that the means to prevent or&#13;
overcome stalls will have to be developed on the basis of as complete an&#13;
understanding of the system of fertility determinants in each country.&#13;

            Stalls in the fertility decline in Costa
            Rica, Korea, and Sri Lanka
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study seeks to answer questions
            regarding stalls in the decline of fertility in three
            countries and the reasons for such stalls. In the three
            countries studied, the total fertility rate began with a
            sustained rapid decline during the l960s, but stalled around
            1975. The explanations of the stalls are partial, and they
            differ from one country to the next. In Costa Rica, marital
            fertility and contraceptive use levelled off, apparently as
            a result of a convergence between desired and actual
            fertility and a weakening of the family planning program. In
            Korea, where two stalls occurred, the first one saw an
            increase in marriage among women 30-49 years old, and in
            marital fertility of those under age 30 which offset
            declines in marriage among women 15-29 years old and in the
            marital fertility of women age 30-49. During the second
            stall, the marital fertility of women 25-29 years old
            increased a bit while among wives 30-34 years old, fertility
            continued to fall, but at a slower rate than earlier. The
            explanation for the fertility stall during the late l970s in
            Sri Lanka is limited. There was a large increase in
            contraceptive use between 1975 and 1982. At least some of
            the fertility-depressing effect of this increase presumably
            was offset by an increase in marriage.
