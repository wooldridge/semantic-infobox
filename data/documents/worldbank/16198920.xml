                                     Arbitration involves using a neutral arbitrator to make a decision about the outcome of the dispute. Once the parties have&#13;
                                     agreed to the process, arbitration is binding (the decision is final and can be appealed only on very narrow grounds).&#13;
                                     Mediation is a process in which a neutral mediator helps the parties discuss and find a mutually acceptable solution.&#13;
                                     Conciliation is a variation of mediation in which a conciliator meets with the parties separately (rather than jointly, as in&#13;
                                     mediation) and seeks concessions from the parties that would help resolve the dispute. Unlike arbitration, conciliation is not&#13;

            Settling out of court : how effective is
            alternative dispute resolution?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Alternative dispute resolution can help
            the justice system in a country function more efficiently.
            It often saves costs and time and increases user
            satisfaction. For cases that go back to court, however, the
            total cost and time may increase. Alternative dispute
            resolution can also have indirect benefits.  It can increase
            the effectiveness of courts by reducing bottlenecks. And it
            can improve trust in the legal system, which may increase
            foreign investment.
