Project Description: Details to Annex I on Complementary Measures for Georgia and Armenia&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the&#13;
Trust Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
Summary&#13;
In 2007, the World Bank teamed up with the European Union, the International Union for the&#13;
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) to support Georgia,&#13;
Armenia, and other ENPI East countries in their efforts to improve forest law, enforcement and&#13;
governance (FLEG). The EU financed the first FLEG Program in the ENPI East + Russia region from&#13;
2008 to 2012. The Government of Austria provided additional financing of 0.3 million EUR to the&#13;
Program in 2011. A follow-on FLEG II Program was launched in 2012 with 9 million EUR grant&#13;
financing from the European Commission. The ADA Trust Fund ("Project") is sought to finance&#13;
complementary measures in Georgia and Armenia and supplement resources available from the EC&#13;
FLEG II Program.&#13;
The overall objectives of the ADA Projectlare to support Georgia and Armenia in strengthening forest&#13;
governance through improving implementation of relevant international processes, enhancing their&#13;
forest policy, legislation and institutional arrangements, and developing, testing and evaluating&#13;
sustainable forest management models at the local level on a pilot basis for future replication. Through&#13;
promoting sustainable forest governance, management, and protection of forests in the participating&#13;
countries, the Project will help ensure the contribution of the country's forests to climate change&#13;
adaptation and mitigation, to ecosystems and biodiversity protection, and to sustainable livelihoods&#13;
and income sources for local populations and national economies. The St. Petersburg Declaration on&#13;
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia, endorsed by 44 governments and&#13;
the European Commission in 2005, articulates governments' commitments to these objectives.&#13;
The three specific Project objectives are:&#13;
i. implementation of the 2005 St. Petersburg FLEG Ministerial Declaration2 and ensuring&#13;
continuation of the process launched in 2005 (regional level);&#13;
ii. formulation and implementation of sustainable forest sector policies, including legal and&#13;
administrative reforms for sustainable forest management and protection (national level); and&#13;
iii. demonstration of best sustainable forest management practices in targeted areas for further&#13;
replication (sub-national level).&#13;
Background&#13;
The Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region accounts for around 22% of the world's forests and stores&#13;
more than 39 (thirty nine) billion tons of carbon. The forestry sector contributes on average between&#13;
1Throughout this document, 'Project' refers to the proposed Complementary Measures for Georgia and Armenia while&#13;
'Program' refers to the EC-funded Forest Law, Enforcement and Governance (FLEG II) Program.&#13;
2The St. Petersburg Declaration, adopted at the November 20005 Ministerial Conference on Forest Law Enforcement and&#13;
Governance (FLEG) in Europe and North Asia (ENA), is an expression of commitment by 44 governments from the ENA&#13;
region and other participating countries to take action to address illegal logging and associated forest crimes. The&#13;
participating governments also identified an Indicative List of Actions for the implementation of the Declaration, which are&#13;
included as an annex to the Declaration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿1.1 to 1.5 percent of GDP and, if sustainably managed, the sector could potentially employ an&#13;
additional 3 million workers and double its contribution to GDP. Forest in both Georgia and Armenia&#13;
cover around 30,000 km2 of forest. Unlike other parts of the world, forests in the ECA region have&#13;
been expanding steadily (1.6% over the last twenty years), and the potential for additional growth&#13;
(both in terms of forest area and volume per hectare) is substantial. However, there are still problems&#13;
associated with: (i) poor governance; (ii) the need to create the right enabling environment through&#13;
appropriate forest institutions that supervise and deliver sound policy and legislation; and (iii) support&#13;
for transitioning to market economies in the forest sector.&#13;
Both countries' development priorities align well with the Project. Georgia's strategic vision for&#13;
development includes rural development for employment generation and poverty reduction;&#13;
strengthened partnership with the EU in the environmental field; continued involvement in&#13;
administering the FLEG Program to provide advice and assistance in forest management. The&#13;
proposed Project interventions for Georgia coincide with major policy and institutional reforms in the&#13;
forest sector, and have a unique chance to contribute to the implementation of the National Forest&#13;
Program  for Georgia, led by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection&#13;
(MENRP). Assisting Georgia with refining its National Forest Policy is one of the key objectives of&#13;
the Project. The MENRP presented the policy statement for stakeholder consideration in September&#13;
2013.&#13;
Armenia's national priorities involve deepening relations with the EU and its member states while&#13;
continuing to maintain strong links with other traditional bilateral partners; improved emphasis on&#13;
preparedness for natural disasters and climate change adaptation; fighting corruption; and reducing&#13;
rural and environmental risks. Armenia's forest policy strategy was developed by the respective&#13;
Ministries of the Republic of Armenia and approved on September 30, 2004 by the Government (for&#13;
15 years, until 2019), covering climate change, rural development, landscape and gender issues. A&#13;
number of environmental NGOs have been discussing and suggesting restructuring the forestry sector&#13;
responsible authority "Hayantar" (Armforest), which has the status of State non-commercial&#13;
organization (SNCO), with limited authorities but a wide range of responsibilities. The discussed&#13;
changes concern institutional and legal framework of the respective authority which will need to be&#13;
agreed and coordinated with the government.&#13;
The Project will help the partner countries to achieve these goalsin close alignment with the EC FLEG&#13;
II Program, which is being implemented in 7 countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia,&#13;
Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian Federation).&#13;
Consistency with the objectives of the Austrian Development Cooperation&#13;
The proposed Project directly responds to the main focal areas of ADC's mandate and is fully&#13;
consistent with the objectives of ADC country strategies for Georgia and Armenia, which aimrural&#13;
development, agriculture, forestry and good governance.&#13;
Target group, beneficiaries and local Project partners&#13;
Key stakeholders of the Project in both countries include: the State forest agencies; environment and&#13;
agriculture ministries; protected areas agencies; forest and environmental academia and&#13;
training/education institutions; State and private forest-related and wood processing industry, other&#13;
forest-related industries (e.g. hunting, tourism and recreation, financial sector, trading houses,&#13;
construction sector); local forest communities in pilot areas; rural households, forest dependent&#13;
comnmunities, and urban dwellers; media; regional, national and sub-national civil society.&#13;
State agencies in both countries are conscious of the need to enhance their institutional capacity for&#13;
forest management in order to sustain their forestry sectors, to help eradicate persistent illegal&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿practices, and to meet rural household demand for firewood, construction material, and non-timber&#13;
forest resources. Representatives of the relevant state agencies are already actively participating in the&#13;
EC FLEG II Program that targets these issues. New activities will build on the results of previous&#13;
FLEG work, analysis of stakeholders and main challenges, as well as the ambition of the countries to&#13;
tackle  these  challenges.  Environmental  NGOs    are   keen  to   cooperate  under   this&#13;
Projecttowardsincreasing public awareness, and highlighting multiple types of benefits from forest&#13;
resources. Representatives of academic circles are eager to use opportunities coming from the&#13;
implementation of the Project activities for applying scientific knowledge to the acute national needs&#13;
in forest inventory, management planning, forest regeneration, pest management, and other similar&#13;
areas.&#13;
Despite intensive growth of natural gas supply coverage in Georgia and Armenia, a good part of&#13;
population in both countries continues to use firewood. The financial crisis (which has led to&#13;
decreasing remittances) and increasing gas prices means that rural households will increasingly revert&#13;
to the use of firewood. Finding legal and affordable ways for rural communities to access sustainably&#13;
locally obtained wood for fuel and construction would have a significant social impact, especially on&#13;
the poor, female members of rural households, and the disadvantaged. Throughout implementation,&#13;
the Project will aim to include these groups of beneficiaries&#13;
Analysis of local potentials&#13;
The Project interventions will contribute to protecting the environment and particularly forests in the&#13;
Georgia and Armenia. Forests comprise a larger area in Georgia than in Armenia, however, in both&#13;
countries forest cover has suffered from unsustainable timber extraction for almost two decades,&#13;
causing deforestation as well as deterioration of the quality of forest cover. Further degradation of&#13;
forest ecosystems would lead to loss of biodiversity and habitats, disruption in water balance,&#13;
deterioration of recreational and aesthetic value of forested areas, soil erosion and a potential increase&#13;
in the occurrence and severity of floods, landslides and avalanches. The Project will aim to provide&#13;
legal and institutional support;helpenable forest-related communities in Georgia and Armenia to&#13;
adequately value the different benefits and services associated with forests; and manage forests&#13;
sustainably while maximizing economic benefits and maintaining the environmental balance of these&#13;
fragile ecosystems.&#13;
Harmonization and Alignment&#13;
The Trust Fund resources will be used to facilitate development of an integrated implementation plan&#13;
so as to maximize complementarities with similar initiatives and so as to avoid any duplication of&#13;
effort. This will include donor coordination, in particular with OBf, GIZ, and other development&#13;
partners, as appropriate. Substantial coordinated external support increases the opportunity to achieve&#13;
tangible results.&#13;
The ADA Project will utilize the same Program Coordination Teams (consisting of representatives&#13;
from the World Bank, IUCN and WWF) as under the EC FLEG I Program to facilitate harmonization&#13;
and alignment. The Program Coordination Teams will aim to facilitate cooperation with the EU&#13;
Delegations and other development partners.&#13;
Various development partners are supporting or have expressed interest to support the implementation&#13;
of sustainable forest management in general and the FLEG processspecifically, including the EU, the&#13;
Governments of Germany, Austria, France, Finland, Norway, a number of multi-lateral partners such&#13;
as UNDP and UNEP and international NGOs (e.g. WWF and IUCN). Austria and Germany responded&#13;
quicklytosomeimmediate needs and stand ready to continue supporting the development of a&#13;
systematic andstrategic process to reform the forest sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The MENRP in Georgia acknowledges the role of donors and the international community in the&#13;
forest sector development process. To ensure the transparency and coordination with various&#13;
stakeholders, the Ministry developed a Donor Coordination Matrix and asked all key players to&#13;
provide relevant information, such as: intervention areas, type of assistance (financial support, long-&#13;
term advisory support, short-term advisor support, expert study, training, study tours,&#13;
workshop/conference), time frame, budget provided for a project/program in the specific intervention&#13;
area, status of a project/program, and implementation partners.&#13;
Furthermore, to facilitate full stakeholder participation, and to coordinate external support to the forest&#13;
policy formulation and to the on-going sectoral reforms, the MENRP established six thematic groups3&#13;
comprised of experts from governmental institutions, academia, NGOs, church, and donor-supported&#13;
projects. Meetings of the thematic groups are convenient forums for multiple stakeholders and&#13;
assisting donor organizations for day-to-day coordination of the specific initiatives in various fields of&#13;
activity.&#13;
Intervention logic&#13;
The ADA funded Project will supplement activities under the EC-funded FLEG II Program in Georgia&#13;
and Armenia. Therefore, the development objectives, main goals, and expected outcomes of the&#13;
Program have been aligned, as much as possible, with those of the EC-funded Program. To ensure&#13;
activities carried out under each of the Programs are complementary, the ADA-supported activities&#13;
will build on the existing Program documentation (including the Country Work Programs (CWPs) for&#13;
Georgia and Armenia). The design of the ADA Project activitiesfor Georgia and Armenia will be&#13;
based on a detailed analysis of the CWPs of both countries to determine and identify financing gaps&#13;
and additional, unmet needs in the countries. The CWPs will identify the specific activities to be&#13;
implemented, demonstrate how these activities will address the Program Development Objectives, the&#13;
time frame for implementation and costs at the activity level. Final approval of the CWP will be a&#13;
function of the Steering Committee. Available information onprograms and projects funded in the&#13;
forestry sector by various multilateral and bilateral institutions in Georgia and Armenia will be&#13;
reviewed carefully, to avoid duplication of efforts and to increase potential of synergy. The Project&#13;
will aim to deepen the results of the FLEG I and FLEG II Programs.&#13;
The Project will assist Georgia and Armenia to:&#13;
*   make progress towards the region-wide objectives agreed to in the 2005 St. Petersburg&#13;
Declaration;&#13;
*   regularly monitor this progress;&#13;
*   incorporate the private sector (forest industry, timber trade, wood processing, tourism) in&#13;
forest governance solutions;&#13;
*   strengthen policies and law enforcement capacity to manage forests sustainably;&#13;
*   strengthen awareness and capacity of civil society to address forest governance challenges;&#13;
and&#13;
*   implement additional pilot projects, trainings, seminars, and publications at the sub-national&#13;
level to demonstrate best practices in law enforcement and forest governance in Georgia and&#13;
Armenia.&#13;
3These thematic groups are: (1) Forest restoration and protection, (2) Economic valuation of forests, (3) Human capacity&#13;
development, (4) Legislation and institutional reform, (5) Forest monitoring and information systems, (6) National&#13;
sustainable forest manaeement standards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Activities&#13;
The Program activities will be implemented over three years, between December 2013 and December&#13;
2016 (with the end of disbursement date being June 30, 2017), and will undertake tasks included under&#13;
the following broad topics:&#13;
*    Support for the development of Policy and Legislation through-&#13;
- Technical support;&#13;
- Participatory processes; and&#13;
- Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment Framework (SESAF)&#13;
*    Capacity building and training;&#13;
*    Forest inventory support&#13;
*    Forestry case studies;&#13;
*    Pilot activities for sustainable forest management, including development of environmental&#13;
management plans; and&#13;
*    Public awareness and dissemination of results.&#13;
In addition, the Trust Fund will also finance activities performed by the Bank such as Trust Fund&#13;
administration and program management, technical assistance, and supervision.&#13;
The ADA supported activities will be fully elaborated during the inception phase when full country&#13;
work plans (CWPs) and a logframe will be prepared and provided to ADA as part of an inception&#13;
report. The inception phase will, through participation and involvement of the relevant government&#13;
and non-government stakeholders aim to increase country ownership.&#13;
Organizational structure&#13;
The program will be implemented by the World Bank in partnership with IUCN and WWF. This&#13;
partnership is considered to be well placed for three reasons:&#13;
i)   it managed the first FLEG Program and is now implementing the FLEG II Program;&#13;
Li) it has a broad relevant portfolio in the partner countries; and&#13;
ii)  the participating organizations have relevant sector expertise.&#13;
3oth countries have designated National Focal Points for liaison with the World Bank, IUCN and&#13;
NWF. In addition, both countries have existing National Program Advisory Committees, comprising&#13;
-epresentatives of the thematic State agencies, NGOs, and private sector. More details on governance&#13;
tre provided in Annex 3 of the Administration Agreement.&#13;
Iccompanying measures&#13;
n addition to the technical. focus of the Project, broad stakeholder participation and public awareness&#13;
vill be undertaken to help increase understanding, build consensus and help start the process of&#13;
iehavior change. Information on the Project achievements and its outputs will be made publicly&#13;
vailable by the Donor and the Bank in according with their respective disclosure policies.&#13;
'he Project will also seek to foster cooperation between Georgia and Armenia in the field of forest&#13;
anagement by supporting experience-sharing, joint training events, and other activities that enhance&#13;
orizontal links at both - the managerial and technical levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
A results framework has been developed for the EC FLEG II Program, which will guide the&#13;
development of a logframe for this Project, which will be made available by the end of the inception&#13;
phase. Reporting will be done in line with the Administration Agreement between the World Bank and&#13;
ADA.&#13;
Sustainability issues&#13;
While the Project does not involve support for identification or preparation of investments that would&#13;
have direct environmental or social impacts, the forest policies/laws, national forestry programs, and&#13;
plans to be developed might have a wide range of environmental and social impacts, both positive and&#13;
negative. A Strategic Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Framework (SESAF) was&#13;
developed for the purposes of implementing the EC FLEG I Program and will be fully applied to the&#13;
ADA Project.&#13;
The SESAF: (1) identifies the types of environmental and social issues that are likely to be associated&#13;
with the policy documents supported by the Project and (2) provides guidance on how these aspects&#13;
should be integrated in to the analytical and decision-making processes, including guidelines for&#13;
strong and effective stakeholder participation. The overall SESAF objective is that all policy&#13;
documents that are supported under this Project will be environmentally and socially sound and&#13;
sustainable, consistent with the World Bank safeguard policies. Socio-cultural aspects as well as&#13;
gender are covered as part of the SESAF. The SESAF is a freestanding document that has been&#13;
disclosed within Georgia and Armenia and is available in the World BankInfoshop.&#13;
Development of institutional and management capacities&#13;
The MENRP of Georgia was re-established recently and the National Forest Agency (NFA) was&#13;
created about a year ago. Therefore much of the technical assistance, to be provided through FLEG II&#13;
Program and its complementary measures under the ADA Trust Fund, will be aimed at capacity&#13;
building within these institutions. Particular emphasis will be made on fostering technical and&#13;
managerial skills within NFA and its regional branches.Efforts will be made to coordinate with the&#13;
Caucasus office of GIZ, which provides bilateral support to human capacity development towards&#13;
sustainable forest management in Georgia with the financing from ADA. GIZ aid aims to develop and&#13;
improve professional and social competencies in the field of forest management and targets the NFA&#13;
as well as the forest practitioners that tend forest operation on the ground.&#13;
The Project will also aim to provide institutional strengthening and capacity building to the forest&#13;
institutions in Armenia ("Hayantar"SNCO that manages the state's forest resources, and the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture) for developing forest policy and legislation.&#13;
Economic viability&#13;
Like the ENPI EC FLEG II Program, the complementary measures proposed for Georgia and Armenia&#13;
comprise diverse technical assistance activities that will be determined during the inception phase.&#13;
Therefore, traditional economic and financial analysis methods are not applicable to assess the&#13;
economic viability of the. Project. The Project will have a number of economic impacts that can be&#13;
described qualitatively, and all of which lead to increased sustainability of forest management by:&#13;
addressing weaknesses in forest policy and legislation and through providing technical&#13;
assistance/capacity building, the program will reduce the perverse incentives that create or&#13;
encourage illegal and unrecorded removals and encourage better management and monitoring.&#13;
This will lead to a reduction in the unsustainable harvest and increases in the sustainable&#13;
harvest,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿*   implementing sustainable pilot activities in selected communities will help raise income from&#13;
environmentally and socially sustainable income, thereby reducing the dependency on illegal&#13;
and unregulated off-take from the forest; and&#13;
*   raising public awareness and education levels will help modify behavior and reduce the social&#13;
acceptability of illegal forest activities over time.&#13;
Increasing the sustainability of forest management and improving the management of the sector is&#13;
assumed to have a number of economic benefits:&#13;
*  the fees derived from sustainable forest use will increase;&#13;
*  the level of sustainable production will increase, including in areas that are currently under-&#13;
managed;&#13;
*  the environmental damage associated with unregulated removal will decrease, thereby&#13;
reducing erosion and contributions towards siltation and damage to downstream infrastructure;&#13;
*  production of Non Timber Forest Products will similarly be increased and sustained&#13;
*  tourism, recreation, and biodiversity conservation will be increased; and&#13;
*   the forests' capacity to sequester carbon will be increased.&#13;
