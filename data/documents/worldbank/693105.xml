for Auctioning Highways&#13;
Eduardo Engel,    This Note argues that many of the problems that have plagued highway privatization stem from&#13;
Ronald Fischer,   the combined effects of special features of the highway business and the type of contracts-fixed&#13;

Galetovic       term franchises-that have typically been used. The Note proposes a new mechanism, the least-&#13;
present-value-of-revenue (LPVR) auction, that corrects some of the shortcomings of the fixed&#13;
term franchise. The new mechanism endogenously adjusts the duration of the franchise to the&#13;
realization of demand: the term lengthens if traffic grows more slowly than expected and short-&#13;
ens if it grows more rapidly than expected.&#13;
There is widespread agreement that most devel-  chises awarded by Spain before 1973 had build-&#13;

this mechanism is far better than current systems.   Because of the high risk associated with high-&#13;
way franchises, lenders have refused to grant&#13;
Fixed term franchises                            franchise holders loans unless governments&#13;

The expectation of renegotiation prompts firms&#13;
The main defect of fixed term mechanisms is   to bid artificially low tolls (to lowball),' expect-&#13;
that they  create unnecessary risk for the fran-   ing better terms after the  contract has been&#13;
chise holder. Since demand is uncertain and    awarded. It also implies that firms that excel at&#13;
competitive bidding  dissipates  ex ante rents,   renegotiating contracts can compete with firms&#13;
the winner of the franchise chooses a franchise   that are considerably more efficient at build-&#13;

LPVR franchises&#13;
The least-present-value-of-revenue mechanism    7be basic principle uniderlyinig LPVR&#13;
corrects several shortcomings of fixed term&#13;
mechanisms. In this approach,              auctions is that thefranchise holder&#13;
* The regulator sets a maximum toll.&#13;
* The franchise is won by the firm bidding the   should not make losses when the long-&#13;
least present value of toll revenue.&#13;
* The franchise ends when the present value of   run demand for the highway is&#13;
toll revenue equals the franchise holder's bid.&#13;
* Toll revenue is discounted at a predetermined   sufficient to pay all costs.&#13;
rate specified in the franchise contract. The&#13;
rate should be a good estimate of the loan&#13;
rate faced by franchise holders.         A further advantage of LPVR auctions is that&#13;
cormpetition for the franchise reveals, through&#13;
As an example, consider an auction with two   the winner's bid, the income required to earn&#13;
firms. The first firm estimates costs of $100   a normal return. This reduces the scope for&#13;
million and bids $112 million, while the sec-   opportunism after the contract is awarded, be-&#13;
ond estimates costs of $99 million and bids   cause the winning bid can be used as a bench-&#13;
$110 million. The second firm wins and oper-   mark. In the case of government opportunism&#13;
ates the franchise until the present value of  leading to a regulatory taking, the franchise&#13;
toll revenue is $110 million.              holder can go to court, asking for fair compen-&#13;
sation equal to the difference between its bid&#13;
Advantages                                 and the present value of toll revenues already&#13;

The basic principle underlying LPVR auctions&#13;
is that the franchise holder should not make   Opportunistic renegotiations that favor the&#13;
losses when the long-run demand for the high-  franchise holder are also less likely, for three&#13;

lengthens when traffic grows more slowly than   lengthens if demand grows more slowly than&#13;
expected, and it shortens when traffic grows   expected, it is less likely that franchise holders&#13;

            Privatizing roads : a new method for
            auctioning highways
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The authors attribute many of the
            problems in highway privatization to the combined effect of
            features of the highway business and the fixed term
            contracts used. First, traffic forecasts are notoriously
            imprecise, and the franchise holder has almost no control
            over demand. Second, most franchises have been awarded for a
            fixed term that is independent of demand realization. They
            propose a new mechanism the --least-present-value-of-revenue
            auction-- that overcomes flaws in the fixed term franchise
            because the contract term automatically adjusts to traffic
            growth. If traffic grows more slowly than expected, the term
            lengthens and if more rapidly, it shortens. The basic
            principle underlying the auction is that the franchise
            holder should not make losses when the long-run demand for
            the highway is sufficient to pay all costs.
