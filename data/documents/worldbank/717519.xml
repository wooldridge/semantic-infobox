&amp;#12;&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
I. The Conflict&#13;
1.    Eritrea's struggle for independence began in 1961, following the annexation of&#13;
Eritrea by Ethiopia, and it intensified following the military coup in Ethiopia in 1974.&#13;
Eritrea became formally independent following an internationally supervised referendum&#13;
in April 1993, two years after the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) gained&#13;
military control of Asmara in May 1991.&#13;
2.    Open conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia erupted in May 1998, as a&#13;
consequence of a dispute over their common border in the Badme region. Until May&#13;
2000, the war with Ethiopia was contained to a relatively limited area in Eritrea, with&#13;
some 270,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) escaping the border territories.&#13;
3.        On May 12, 2000 Ethiopia launched a major new offense on several fronts,&#13;
advancing approximately 100 km deep into Eritrean territory, causing a dramatic&#13;
humanitarian crisis, with the massive and sudden internal displacement of approximately&#13;
1.1 million people (i.e. about one third of the national population).&#13;
4.    On June 18, 2000, the parties have agreed to a cease-fire and to resume the peace&#13;
talks on the basis of the existing OAU Peace Framework Agreement. The agreement,&#13;
inter alia, calls for a buffer zone about 16 miles wide inside Eritrea, where 4,200 UN&#13;
Peacekeepers (UNMEE) are to be stationed until Ethiopia withdraws to its pre-war&#13;
position and a final settlement to the dispute is reached.&#13;
5.    UNMEE will deploy in three phases. The first phase has already been completed&#13;
with the establishment of two Military Liaison Offices. The second phase involves the&#13;
deployment of 100 Military Observers, 50 in each country. About half of the observers&#13;
have already been deployed in September. The third phase will consist of the deployment&#13;
of 4,200 peacekeepers along the border.&#13;
II.  Humanitarian Impact&#13;
6.    The resumption of fighting on May 12, 2000 had a disastrous humanitarian&#13;
impact on Eritrea. The most dramatic consequence of the conflict has been the sudden&#13;
displacement of approximately 1.1 million people from the Gash Barka and Debub&#13;
regions, which contribute some 70 percent of Eritrea's total grain production and are host&#13;
to approximately 47 percent of the total population. Of these IDPs, an estimated 230,000&#13;
have been settled in several camps in central Eritrea, 50,000 have crossed the border into&#13;
Sudan and the remaining are without a secure place to stay. Furthermore, approximately&#13;
70,000 people have been deported from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ethiopia back into Eritrea. The sudden movement of such large numbers of people, in a total&#13;
population of roughly 3.5 million, has put host communities under considerable strain and it is&#13;
estimated that about 170,000 people in host communities are also affected.&#13;
7.    Several rapid assessments of the humanitarian situation have been carried out by&#13;
the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC) in collaboration with UN&#13;
agencies and NGOs. According to these assessments, the situation of IDPs remains&#13;
critical, although there have been some small improvements since the crisis began.&#13;
Generally, displaced people have been living without shelter and access to potable water&#13;
and sanitation; their movements have been fluid, often seeking safety in remote areas,&#13;
making access by the relief agencies extremely difficult, especially after the inception of&#13;
rains. Distribution of food aid has been uneven among IDPs locations, and signs of&#13;
children malnutrition have started to appear in camps. Furthermore, displacement has had&#13;
a major negative impact on agricultural activities. The Ministry of Agriculture has&#13;
estimated that, as of early August, only 38 percent of normal agricultural activity had&#13;
occurred, which means there will be great repercussions on harvesting prospects and food&#13;
security for next year. As far as health conditions are concerned, poor hygienic conditions&#13;
in the camps have caused the spreading of infectious diseases, particularly respiratory&#13;
infections. Recent reports have revealed that there is currently 1 doctor available per&#13;
35,000 people in the country, and that only 10 out of 58 health facilities in Gash Barka&#13;
are still functioning. The same reports stress that 80 percent of the IDPs camps have no&#13;
form of emergency education facility. At the same time, the demographic profile of IDPs&#13;
is: 65-70 percent children, 25-27 percent women, and the rest are elderly. This&#13;
underscores the urgency for support to arrest further suffering and to begin the recovery&#13;
efforts.&#13;
8.    Under the current circumstances, return to original residence is not yet a safe&#13;
option for the majority of IDPs. The Ethiopian Army still has control over large areas&#13;
south of the Gash River and Upper Gash and Galuj sub-zones. In areas close to the&#13;
border, the main threat to returnees comes from landmines. Figures on the number of&#13;
returnees are difficult to obtain at this point. According to the last rapid assessment&#13;
jointly conducted by ERREC, UN and other NGOs, as of August 2000, 163,077 people&#13;
had voluntarily returned to the Gash Barka, Debub and Anseba region - only 14 percent&#13;
of the total IDPs population. More recent reports show that, as of September, the number&#13;
of returnees has been increasing. Three out of the twenty two existing IDPs camps had&#13;
been emptied, and their inhabitants had returned to their home areas. The most recent&#13;
estimates by ERREC however suggest that, as of late September, there were still 212,885&#13;
IDPs living in a total of 25 camps, with the rest of IDPs still scattered throughout the&#13;
country. Furthermore, a total of 23,881 Eritreans refugees from Sudan have been&#13;
repatriated so far, through a tri-partite arrangement between the Government of Eritrea,&#13;
the Government of Sudan and UNHCR. The three parties are constantly assessing&#13;
whether the situation is conducive to promote repatriation of this group. The last rapid&#13;
assessment estimated that there is need to provide three months worth of ratios to&#13;
returning families, together with drought-resistant seeds, hand tools and tents. There is&#13;
also an urgent need to rehabilitate basic social infrastructure in most villages where&#13;
people are planning to return.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.    Besides war, Eritrea is also suffering from recurrent drought. Along with several&#13;
other parts of the Horn of Africa, the Sahel area of Eritrea (predominantly pastoral areas)&#13;
has been particularly affected by the failure of short rains two years in a row. Out-&#13;
migration to more food-secure and urban areas has begun. Some 316,000 people are&#13;
estimated to have been affected.&#13;
III. Damage Assessment&#13;
10.  In September 2000, the Government made available to the international donors&#13;
community the final Damage Assessment, prepared under the coordination of the&#13;
University of Asmara, which gives a monetary estimate of property destroyed in the two&#13;
war affected regions, Gash Barka and Debub. The Damage Assessment has provided an&#13;
important basis for the costing of the ERP, although it should not be considered by any&#13;
means exhaustive - its focus is strictly economic, does not factor human or social costs,&#13;
and it is geographically confined. In fact, areas still under Ethiopian control could not be&#13;
accessed by the surveyors, and damages caused by the war in the area around Assab were&#13;
also not factored in. Therefore the results of the damage assessment should be considered&#13;
as incomplete and preliminary.&#13;

11.   The assessment classifies damaged "property" into the following five categories:&#13;
(a) Farming Households (including houses, livestock and draught animals, cereals,&#13;
agricultural implements and household items); (b) Non-Farming Households (including&#13;
shops, hotels, bars, restaurants, small businesses); (c) Residential Households (including&#13;
urban houses and their valuables); (d) Public Infrastructure (including schools, hospitals&#13;
and health centers, and government offices); and (e) Expensive Property (including&#13;
agricultural and industrial complexes, bridges, roads, vehicles and large equipment).&#13;
12.   The surveyors visited 22 sub-zobas in Debub and Gash Barka. The information&#13;
was collected through specific questionnaires distributed to 299 informants, who had&#13;
been chosen as representatives for each Kebabi, the smallest administrative unit in&#13;
Eritrea. The data collected in each Kebabi were subsequently aggregated to give the total&#13;
cost estimate. The results were finally compared with informnation available within the&#13;
relevant local administrations.&#13;
13.   Practically, all Kebabis in each-sub-zoba suffered damages with the exception of&#13;
Dekemhare, Debarawa, and Segheneiti in Debub. Overall, the damages that have been&#13;
incurred are significant and their order of magnitude is US$ 564 million - slightly larger&#13;
than the national GDP (US$ 509 million). The findings show that, as a result of the war,&#13;
the Gash Barka region suffered the most, with 74 percent of total damages, while the&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
remaining 26 percent is in Debub. Per capita value of property loss is estimated to be&#13;
around US$ 1,000 in Gash Barka and US$ 100 in Debub (including both private assets,&#13;
and damage to large establishments and public infrastructure).&#13;
14.   With regard to the spectrum of the damages, the agricultural sector has incurred&#13;
the highest damages - approximately US$ 352 million, i.e. 62.4 percent of the total - of&#13;
which 74.8 percent occurred in the Gash Barka region alone. The bulk of agricultural&#13;
damages are due to loss of livestock, amounting to approximately US$ 225 million. The&#13;
total value of missing cereal is US$ 47 million. The bulk of damages inflicted on non-&#13;
farning households (mainly urban dwellers and shop-keepers) is mostly in the Debub&#13;
region (58 percent) and amounts to approximately US$ 95 million.&#13;
15.  In terms of private housing, the assessment calculates that a total of 54,276 houses&#13;
have been destroyed in both regions, for an estimated value of US$ 41 million, excluding&#13;
those houses which need to be repaired. The values of the damages sustained by public&#13;
buildings is comparatively less - about 4.2 percent of the total - and amounts to an&#13;
estimated US$ 24 million. Of this amount, US$ 4.7 million is the cost of schools which&#13;
have been destroyed; while the cost of destroyed hospitals and health facilities totals US$&#13;
2.5 million. The majority of public infrastructure was destroyed in Debub (56 percent)&#13;
while almost all of the destroyed industrial infrastructure is in Gash Barka. Most of the&#13;
industrial damage was to the Alighider ginning factory and the Tokombia Tobacco&#13;
enterprise. The total cost for the loss of these and other large scale properties (e.g.&#13;
bridges, roads, commercial farns) is approximately US$ 53 million.&#13;

IV. Economic Impact&#13;
16.   Since the conflict began in May 1998, Eritrea has accumulated substantial&#13;
economic stress. Average real GDP growth has declined from 8 percent in 1997 to 3&#13;
percent in 1999. Activity in most sectors has slowed largely because of labor shortages&#13;
following mobilization of nearly 170,000 citizens for the war effort, the influx of war-&#13;
related refugees, war-related expenditures, the closure of the border with Ethiopia, and&#13;
shortages of foreign exchange.&#13;
17.   With the outbreak of the conflict in May 1998, and the closure of the border, trade&#13;
relations between the two countries were totally disrupted. In addition, the diversion of&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ethiopia's transit goods away from Assab port since May 1998 resulted in a considerable&#13;
loss of fiscal revenue (4 percent of GNP), external service receipts, and in increased&#13;
unemployment. These losses, coupled with an increase in defense and relief expenditures&#13;
related to the war, have been the principal sources of fiscal pressures for Eritrea&#13;
18.   An IMF mission was conducted in parallel to the ERP appraisal to look at the&#13;
state of the Eritrean economy immediately after the conflict. Generally, mission findings&#13;
show that the macroeconomic pressures which began in 1998 persisted throughout the&#13;
first seven months of 2000, yet most current figures are in line with projections.&#13;
Preliminary estimates suggest that the fiscal deficit increased from 5.5 percent of GNP in&#13;
1997 to 48 percent in 1999, and has not substantially decreased in the year 2000. Short of&#13;
external financing, the deficit has been financed by a sharp increase in domestic&#13;
borrowing, from US$ 4.8 million in 1997 to about US$ 160 million in 1999 and projected&#13;
to total US$ 130 million in 2000. Furthermore, gross international reserves have declined&#13;
from the equivalent of 6.4 months worth of imports in 1997 to 3.3 months in 1999.&#13;
Interviews with private sector representatives, as well as the banks, suggest that the&#13;
private sector currently has almost no access to foreign exchange and this has had a&#13;
significant inhibiting effect on private sector activity. The contraction on domestic output&#13;
has resulted in a steady increase in inflation rates, from 11.2 percent in December 1999 to&#13;
18.4 percent in June 2000.&#13;
19.   Total expenditures have been moderately lower than expected, with the most&#13;
notable overruns for domestic capital projects (e.g. for emergency reconstruction of basic&#13;
infrastructure which had not been budgeted for this year). Defenses outlays were lower&#13;
than projected, and lower than during the first seven months of last year, yet still&#13;
accounting for 29 percent of total expenditures.&#13;
20.   Furthermore, the conflict has threatened Eritrea's efforts to reduce poverty. With&#13;
a per capita income among the lowest in Africa ($200), Eritrea is one of the poorest&#13;
countries in the world. Most of the country's social indicators, such as average life&#13;
expectancy (46 years) and infant mortality (135 per 1000 births), tend to be lower than in&#13;
the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result of the last outbreak of hostilities, most&#13;
families have been affected by the mobilization of almost all the men aged 18-40, so that&#13;
90 percent of the displaced households are now female headed. Overall, the sudden loss&#13;
of productive assets during the last displacement, and the disruption of the planting&#13;
season in Eritrea's breadbasket regions, are factors which are likely to negatively affect&#13;
poor households' income for at least one more year.&#13;
V.  Government Response&#13;
21.   The Government's response to the crisis has been twofold: (i) provision of&#13;
emergency relief and assistance to the IDPs and the host communities; and (ii)&#13;
organization of available human and financial resources in order to start the process of&#13;
reconstructing and rehabilitating the areas damaged by the recent fighting.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(i) Emergency relief has been mainly provided by the Eritrean Relief and Refugee&#13;
Commission (ERREC) which, since the time of the liberation struggle, has provided essential&#13;
food, shelter, and medical care for people in need. Based on its long experience and ties with&#13;
local communities, during this emergency, ERREC has been the agency responsible for&#13;
delivering humanitarian assistance, as well as the agency responsible for NGO coordination.&#13;
Despite its limited capacity, ERREC has so far succeeded in providing most people with&#13;
sufficient food, medicine, shelter and other basic goods and services to prevent major loss of&#13;
life or disease. It has been able to do this by importing food and essential supplies using scarce&#13;
foreign exchange.&#13;
(ii) Reconstruction activities have also been promptly planned by the Government. To&#13;
this end, the Government has requested Bank's assistance through the proposed ERP. The&#13;
government's reconstruction strategy is complex and requires the involvement of all&#13;
government agencies, as well as a significant contributions from the international community.&#13;
The process of reconstruction and rehabilitation of such large areas of the country will be&#13;
undertaken in two phases: (i) a first set of immediate needs will be met through the financing of&#13;
the ERP which will enable the country to restart some productive activities and repair key&#13;
infrastructure; (ii) the remaining and less urgent needs will be addressed through individual&#13;
sector programs prepared and financed in collaboration with the development community, and&#13;
within the framework of the 2001 - 2003 medium term development program.&#13;
VI. International Response&#13;
22.   Since the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998, most donors have responded to the&#13;
different emergency appeals put out by the Government, however in most cases new&#13;
funds were not committed. An appeal to seek international support for emergency and&#13;
relief needs was launched by ERREC in collaboration with the UN in May, 2000, for&#13;
US$ 48.7 million, and revised in July to US$ 87.4 million, owing to the sudden crisis.&#13;
The response to this appeal has been more positive than in the case of previous appeals,&#13;
although approximately 50 percent below the expected needs. Donors have included&#13;
European Union, Italy, the United States, Denmark, Japan, The Netherlands, Saudi&#13;
Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, France and the United Nations agencies (World Food&#13;
Program, United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNDP, FAO, WHO, tTNFPA,&#13;
and UNICEF) which have supplied funds, goods and logistical assistance. International&#13;
NGOs, including OXFAM, Save the Children (U.K.), Africare, ACCORD, International&#13;
Committee of the Red Cross, CARE International and others, are working through&#13;
ERREC to provide water and sanitation facilities, tents and tarps, and essential food and&#13;
medicines to the IDPs and the refugee camps. A new UN Consolidated Inter-Agency&#13;
Appeal for Eritrea will be launched early next year.&#13;
23.   Since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on June 18, 2000,&#13;
most donors have been revising their stance on development cooperation and are ready to&#13;
resume development activities in Eritrea. The Government asked for the Bank's&#13;
assistance in preparing the ERP and presenting it to the international community for&#13;
financial support. The Program was discussed with representatives of several multilateral&#13;
and bilateral agencies during a preliminary meeting organized by the Government in&#13;
Asmara in July 2000, as well as during meetings with individual donor agencies. The first&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
response so far has been good, both in terms of working together at identifying a single&#13;
set of procedures which satisfy all co-financing partners, and in terms of financial&#13;
support. Subsequently, a multi-donor ERP appraisal mission has been carried out to&#13;
assess the feasibility and adequacy of the program's individual components, as well as to&#13;
finalize procurement, financial management and implementation issues. A meeting to&#13;
finalize the financing plan for the program was organized by the Government in&#13;
September 2000, during the program appraisal mission. The following five donors&#13;
besides IDA have pledged money to the ERP: European Union (US$ 50 million'), Italy&#13;
(US$ 58.7 million), Denmark (US$ 11 million), France (US$ 3 million), and the African&#13;
Development Bank (US$ 21 million).&#13;
B.    IDA's RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
I.    The Elements of IDA's Response&#13;
24.   When the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia first broke out in 1998, the&#13;
Bank's initial posture was to continue lending, although in practice no new lending&#13;
operations were approved to Eritrea since there were none ready to go to the Board at that&#13;
time. In April 1999, after an escalation of hostilities, the Bank decided to defer all new&#13;
lending to both Eritrea and Ethiopia. However, the Bank continued to be fully engaged&#13;
through non-lending activities and preparation of new projects to be presented to the&#13;
Board once the time would be appropriate. Despite the war, disbursements on existing&#13;
portfolios have continued, as well as routine supervision missions.&#13;
25.   Recent briefings to the Board have stressed that, even in the absence of a final&#13;
peace agreement, the Bank would nonetheless resume selective project lending to both&#13;
countries for urgent, high impact operations which would have large benefits to the poor&#13;
and have an unquestionable developmental impact. The Board was usually supportive of&#13;
this approach.&#13;
26.   During the last outbreak of hostilities, and the unfolding of the consequent&#13;
humanitarian crisis, the Bank received a request from the Government of Eritrea for&#13;
emergency assistance. With the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the&#13;
Bank's response has been threefold:&#13;
* Reallocation of: (i) US$1.2 million equivalent from the ongoing Health Project&#13;
(Credit No. 3023-ER) to finance essential drugs and other urgently needed medical&#13;
supplies; and (ii) up to US$3.7 million equivalent from the ongoing Eritrea&#13;
Community Development Fund (ECDF) Project (Credit No. 2823-ER) to finance&#13;
water supply and sanitation subprojects in areas with high concentrations of IDPs,&#13;
The EU delegation present at the pledging conference informed the mission that they are pursuing the&#13;
allocation of up to an additional 35 million EURO for the rehabilitation of infrastructure. The Bank has&#13;
recently learned that this additional amount will be forthcoming from the EU, which would leave no&#13;
financing gap in the Program.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
which are of high priority in the current emergency situation. These two reallocations&#13;
are fully consistent with the original development objectives of the projects.&#13;
* Reallocation of US$20 million equivalent from the ongoing Human Resources&#13;
Development Project (Credit No. 3033-ER) to finance nutritional supplements,&#13;
kitchen utensils, stoves, agricultural inputs, and associated transport services.&#13;
* Preparation of an Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP) in collaboration with all&#13;
interested development partners.&#13;
27.   Furthermore, in June 2000, the Board approved the Eritrea Early Childhood&#13;
Development project (US$ 40 million), the first new lending operation in two years, thus&#13;
endorsing the idea of selective lending. The project covers child and maternal health and&#13;
nutrition, childhood education and support for children in difficult situations.&#13;
II.  IDA's assistance strategy / Rationale for Bank's involvement&#13;
28.   The Bank has recently finalized an Interim Support Strategy for Eritrea, as a&#13;
precursor to a more detailed Transitional Support Strategy, expected to be defined in&#13;
2002. The Interim Support Strategy outlines the Bank's assistance strategy to the&#13;
Government in the transition to peace over the next 12-18 months. The strategy takes into&#13;
account the serious constraints presently affecting the country's development prospects&#13;
such as: (i) the lack of a final negotiated peace agreement; (ii) the prolonged need for&#13;
humanitarian relief over the next 18-24 months; (iii) the severe macroeconomic&#13;
imbalances; (iv) the drop in exports and the dramatic increase in domestic debt; and (v)&#13;
the physical damages to infrastructure. Taking these factors into account, the strategy&#13;
revolves around three pillars: (i) the existing Portfolio (six projects) will be managed so&#13;
as to maximize its contribution to the emergency humanitarian needs and reconstruction&#13;
efforts of the country; (ii) the level of new lending for FY01  i.e. the interim period - will&#13;
be increased above the yearly allocation set for Eritrea (US$ 90 million), thus&#13;
acknowledging the country's extraordinary needs for financing in order to rebuild both&#13;
the infrastructure and the economy. Besides the ERP, new lending for FY01 will include&#13;
an HIV/AIDS-Malaria-Tuberculosis project (HAMSET). Preparation of priority&#13;
programs for the next phase of the transitional support strategy will involve&#13;
demobilization and support for macroeconomic management. The government has&#13;
already started the demobilization process. Once there is significant progress in the peace&#13;
process and the UN peace-keepers are in place, the Government is planning to ask&#13;
support from the International Community to finance the costs associated with the&#13;
demobilization effort. Should available grant resources not be available, the Government&#13;
may approach IDA. The Bank will also be working with the IMF on a potential balance&#13;
of payments support program. (iii) Non-lending work will be carried out during this&#13;
interim period: three pieces of Economic and Sector Work in the Financial, Agriculture&#13;
and Export Development sectors; a Heath Sector Note and an Education Sector Note; as&#13;
well as a Country Economic Memorandum. During the Interim period, Government will&#13;
also prepare an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP), that will guide long-&#13;
term development strategy and will underpin the new CAS.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29.   The proposed ERP was conceived to address the five constraints outlined by the&#13;
Interim Support Strategy. The Program acknowledges that any long-term development&#13;
solution will be subject to achieving a durable and stable peace. Still, the Program also&#13;
considers that, short of a final peace agreement, the country's immediate needs are&#13;
overwhelming, particularly given the size of Eritrea's economy, the current&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances (e.g. large deficit, shrinking foreign reserves), the drop in&#13;
exports and in private sector productivity, and the scarce access to external financing.&#13;
30.   The Program's rationale primarily underscores the idea that neglecting these&#13;
urgent needs would eventually jeopardize the country's long-term development&#13;
prospects. Nevertheless, it carefully takes into account the risks associated with the&#13;
present circumstances. Specifically, the size of the Program (US$ 287.7 million) was&#13;
conceived not to cover all the country's needs, but rather to ensure sustainability, i.e. it&#13;
keeps in mind the small size of the economy, the limited implementation and absorption&#13;
capacity, and the necessity to avoid unsustainable debt levels in the future. Given its&#13;
limited size, the Program was therefore designed according to the principle of selectivity:&#13;
it chooses to prioritize those areas (e.g. infrastructure and private sector rehabilitation)&#13;
which will eventually jump-start the economy and create the conditions for long-term&#13;
development, while at the same time tackling the immediate economic and social needs&#13;
of the most vulnerable people.&#13;
31.       In 1996 the Board approved the first CAS for Eritrea. The former CAS&#13;
directly supports Eritrea's development priorities and the country's overall strategy for&#13;
post-conflict reconstruction after its 30 years long war independence war with Ethiopia.&#13;
The CAS places particularly high priority on (i) Private Sector Reconstruction, in&#13;
particular by expanding investment, production and exports; (ii) strengthening physical&#13;
infrastructure, such as roads and public services, to ensure effectiveness of economic&#13;
activities; (iii) human resource development, through the strengthening of education,&#13;
training and institutional capacity; and (iv) support for poor communities and vulnerable&#13;
groups through social funds.&#13;
32.   The Emergency Reconstruction Program directly supports all CAS objectives. It&#13;
supports these objectives by: (i) providing debt relief and working capital to the war-&#13;
affected private sector, so that it can effectively lead the country's economic recovery;&#13;
(ii) restoring key roads networks and power plants so that economic activity, trade and&#13;
delivery of social services can be quickly resumed; (iii) offering technical assistance to&#13;
banks in credit risk analysis, and in developing banking regulations, and to the Ministry&#13;
of Public Works in managing the works program; and (iv) assisting poor rural&#13;
communities and IDPs in the effort to rebuild basic social infrastructure and to repair&#13;
housing, as well as by providing them with access to micro-credit schemes and temporary&#13;
employment opportunities. Furthermore, through the Balance of Payment component -&#13;
which is not financed, by IDA but included as part of the ERP appraised package - the&#13;
program helps macroeconomic stabilization, by making resources available to the&#13;
Government which are essential to revitalize its foreign exchange reserves and to manage&#13;
its fiscal deficit.&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. Lessons Learned&#13;
33.   A previous Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Credit (ERRC) to the&#13;
Transitional Government of Ethiopia for Eritrea2 had been approved by IDA in March&#13;
1993, for an amount of US$ 25 million. The ERRC was a multi-donor, multi-sector&#13;
emergency program, aiming to restore agricultural and industrial production, rehabilitate&#13;
infrastructure, support communities rehabilitation, and strengthen public institutions after&#13;
a devastating thirty years long independence war. The Implementation Completion&#13;
Report of RRPE rates the outcome as generally satisfactory, as implementation was&#13;
substantially completed within the three year time frame, and over 90 percent of donors&#13;
funds were disbursed. The program (US$ 156 million) provided the bulk of donor aid&#13;
supporting Eritrea's economic recovery, and it contributed to a steady GNP growth&#13;
between 1994-96 (from 1 percent to 6.5 percent). The main lessons learned from this&#13;
experience were:&#13;
*  Commitment and ownership of the borrower is essential for a successful&#13;
implementation of emergency projects.&#13;
*  Multi-donor operations are complex to manage. It is important that responsibilities for&#13;
donor coordination are well-established early in the program; that different&#13;
emergency procurement and disbursement procedures are well harmnonized; that&#13;
flexibility in these procedures is introduced, since in an emergency situation speed of&#13;
implementation is as critical as accountability.&#13;
*  The borrower needs early assistance and training to be able to handle emergency&#13;
procedures, particularly on procurement.&#13;
C. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.   Program Objectives&#13;
34.   The immediate objective of the proposed program is to begin the process of long-&#13;
term reconstruction and economic recovery. Particular attention is being paid to long&#13;
term sustainability so that actions taken now during the emergency do not have long-term&#13;
adverse consequences on institutions and programs. In addition, elements of the ERP will&#13;
complement the ongoing efforts coordinated by ERREC to respond to the immediate&#13;
humanitarian needs.&#13;
35.   The needs arising from the conflict and drought are overwhelming for a country&#13;
of Eritrea's size. As indicated earlier, a partial and preliminary estimate of damage in&#13;
Gash Barka and Debub, excluding the areas still under Ethiopian control, is US$ 564&#13;
million. Given the limited resources available, the program is designed to finance a set of&#13;
complementary actions in support of the public and private sectors that will both be&#13;
responsible for restarting the economy. One set of actions revolves around rebuilding&#13;
infrastructure: roads and bridges (which are also important for the humanitarian&#13;
program), power facilities, schools and health centers, to prevent a further decline in&#13;
social indicators.&#13;
2 Eritrea had not yet become a member of the Bank Group by then. Obligation of the Credit was assumed&#13;
by the Government of Eritrea upon joining the World Bank in July 1994&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36.   These actions will be complemented by a set of programs to assist households to&#13;
rebuild their livelihoods and to jumpstart the private sector. A set of complementary&#13;
financial programs will be offered: debt forgiveness for bank borrowers most directly&#13;
affected by the conflict, small loans through the Village Bank program for households&#13;
and small enterprises, and larger loans through the commercial banks, which will also&#13;
provide access to foreign exchange. In addition, a large agricultural component will&#13;
provide households with inputs that will enable them to begin farming activities again, in&#13;
the expectation that agricultural production will quickly move back to prewar levels. A&#13;
balance of payments component will provide much needed liquidity and flexibility to the&#13;
37.   The number of people who will be able to return to their community of origin in&#13;
the immediate future is still uncertain. This is due to various reasons: (i) the peace&#13;
process has not been completely finalized; (ii) the border demarcation process may take&#13;
some time; and (iii) in the meanwhile, Ethiopian forces are still occupying portions of&#13;
Eritrean territory. For these reasons, the ERP will focus on people and the services they&#13;
need, rather than purely on rehabilitation of infrastructure. This will mean that the&#13;
program will provide resources for both reconstruction of key infrastructure for those&#13;
communities where people will be able to return in the short term (i.e. roads, bridges,&#13;
power facilities, housing), and provision of temporary services (i.e., make-shift&#13;
classrooms, mobile health facilities) for both temporarily resettled and host communities.&#13;
II.  Program Costing and Financing&#13;
38.   The Program includes five major sub-components: (i) Agriculture (ii)&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation (iii) Private Sector Reconstruction (iv) Social Protection and&#13;
(v) Balance of Payments.&#13;
39.   Program Costing  The total costing for the Program has been estimated at&#13;
US$287.7 million. IDA's proposed contribution is US$90 million.&#13;

40.   Program Financing Plan and Size of IDA Contribution. The GOE expressed&#13;
its vision of seeing the ERP as an umbrella program to be financed, through parallel or&#13;
co-financing, by a multiplicity of donors. With this view, a meeting with representatives&#13;
of the donor community was organized on September 9, 2000, to present the program and&#13;
seek co-financing. The proposed size of IDA contribution is US$ 90 million, to finance&#13;
activities in agriculture, road rehabilitation, energy, private sector reconstruction and&#13;
social protection. The tables below show the current financing plan for the ERP, and the&#13;
allocation of IDA resources across the Program's component.&#13;

The EU delegation informed the mission that they are actively pursuing the allocation of additional&#13;
resources up to 35 million Euro for the rehabilitation of infrastructure. If this additional amount is&#13;
secured, that would leave no financing gap in the Program.&#13;

III. Agricultural Component&#13;
(US$43 million, of which IDA US$15 million)&#13;
41.   Objective. The agriculture component will finance the purchase and distribution&#13;
of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools (hand tools and implements to be drawn by&#13;
animals), tractors and machinery, livestock, storage facilities, and veterinary inputs.&#13;
Agricultural inputs, including livestock will be given as a one-time grant to an estimated&#13;
770,000 war and drought-affected households, the majority of whom are farmers, to&#13;
enable them to resume agricultural and livestock production. It is expected that the&#13;
distribution of small stock (poultry and bees) and of machinery services will particularly&#13;
benefit women farmers, as there has been a sharp increase in the number of female&#13;
headed households during and after the conflict.&#13;
42.   Description. IDA financing for this component will be US$15 million. Initially,&#13;
the Government's proposal for agriculture amounted to US$ 68.2 million, divided&#13;
between three categories: (i) Land Resources and Crop Production (32 percent) (ii)&#13;
Agricultural Machinery (55 percent) and (iii) Livestock production (13 percent). The&#13;
appraisal mission reduced the size of the agricultural component from US$68.2 million to&#13;
US$43 million. The agricultural machinery component was cut from US$37.4 million to&#13;
US$17 million, the crop production component was cut to US$ 17 million, while the&#13;
livestock production component was slightly increased to US$9.5 million. The main&#13;
reasons for the suggested cut to the Government's proposal are that: (i) the agricultural&#13;
component would be too large for the overall financial envelope of the Program; (ii) the&#13;
proposal was too concentrated on acquiring machinery that was sometimes inappropriate&#13;
for the factor proportions of a very low wage country; and (iii) the proposal did not&#13;
devote sufficient resources to the most serious loss, namely livestock.&#13;
43.   The Ministry of Agriculture informed the mission that it was preparing additional&#13;
data on the machinery component with a view to increasing its size. The mission agreed&#13;
to re-consider the relative sizes and compositions of the three components, within the&#13;
overall agricultural envelope of the operation, subject to technical evaluation at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
44.   Based on the program submitted by the govermnent to the appraisal mission, the&#13;
agriculture component of the operation would still have the three sub-components&#13;
proposed by the Government: (i) land resources and crop production; (ii) mechanized&#13;
agriculture and support services; and (iii) animal resources. These components have been&#13;
targeted to the regions and affected groups within those regions to revive productive&#13;
capacities, to permit rural families to return to their farms and to launch some new&#13;
activities, and to restore public services that were destroyed.&#13;
Part 1. The Land Resources and Crop Production sub-component would finance&#13;
about 53 percent of the agriculture component. It would allow acquisition of: (i) some&#13;
20,000 tons of seeds for the main cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables grown by&#13;
small farmers, mainly in Debub and Gash-Barka; (ii) some US$ 2.8 million of local hand&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tools and spare parts for farn families; (iii) 1,500 tons of fertilizers for crops3; (iv) 10,000&#13;
draft animals (oxen and camels) for roughly 5,000 small farmer families who lost their&#13;
stock in the war; (v) water pumps to permit some small-scale irrigation; (vi) rehabilitation&#13;
of soil conservation works destroyed or damaged during the war; (vii) afforestation of&#13;
damaged areas; (viii) a small program of adaptive research, to be financed entirely by&#13;
DANIDA (which has an on-going project to assist Eritrea agriculture) for the conflict&#13;
areas; and (ix) a small credit fund, to be financed entirely by DANIDA, for farm families&#13;
who lost assets in the war.&#13;
Part 2. The Mechanized Agriculture and Support Services sub-component is&#13;
intended to restore some of the public and private sectors' capacities to provide farmn&#13;
power for cultivation, transport, harvesting, and threshing in view of the losses in the war.&#13;
The provision of tractors and other heavy machinery is needed for the following reasons:&#13;
(i) the reduced availability of agricultural labor calls for a partial and temporary shift&#13;
from labor-intensive to mechanized agriculture; (ii) since part of the Gash Barka and&#13;
Debub regions will not be available for agricultural production in the near future, there is&#13;
need to expand activities elsewhere in those zobas through mechanized agriculture; and&#13;
(iii) to replace draft power, during one or two seasons, which was formerly contributed&#13;
by animals killed or looted in the war. The sub-component would finance: (i) small&#13;
tractors for primary cultivation; (ii) seed planters, weeders and other tools; (iii) some&#13;
harvesting equipment in areas where labor is unusually scarce because of the war and the&#13;
related disruption; (iv) transport equipment to move harvests from isolated areas to roads&#13;
and markets; (v) threshing equipment in areas where labor is scarce; and (vi) workshops,&#13;
storage and repair facilities. With IDA and FAO technical assistance the Government of&#13;
Eritrea is preparing a plan to privatize this machinery after the immediate needs related to&#13;
the war emergency have been met.&#13;
Part 3. The Animal Resources sub-component is intended to restore productive&#13;
capacities through restocking and feed production and to introduce new income&#13;
generating activities, especially for women. This sub-component would specifically&#13;
finance: (i) restocking of poultry (about 560,000 chicks, feed, and animal housing),&#13;
targeted to camps of displaced persons and to those who have gone back to devastated&#13;
areas; (ii) bee-keeping activities (stock, feed, and housing); (iii) limited restocking of&#13;
approximately 156,000 ruminants (beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys); (iv)&#13;
strategic feed supplies and range improvements for ruminants; and (v) vaccine&#13;
acquisition, laboratory materials and other items to restore some of the public veterinary&#13;
service.&#13;
45.   The appraisal mission noted that while livestock were by far the most seriously&#13;
damaged asset, they are also the most difficult to replace. One reason is that animals are&#13;
in very inelastic supply (unlike seeds, fertilizer and machines, which are imported). An&#13;
injection of cash may cause animal prices to rise sharply. A second reason is that only&#13;
older animals may be available for sale; such animals have little or no remaining growth&#13;
potential and so the only profit realized by their new owners will be the cash value of the&#13;
purchase price if the latter is subsidized. A third reason is that feed will be scarce because&#13;
3 The government has adequate stocks of fertilizers for cereals and legumes for the 2001 season and these&#13;
would not be procured under the proposed operation.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of the drought; a sudden increase in the stocking rate (if indeed it happens) is therefore&#13;
unsustainable. Fourth, distributing oxen in the 2000 farming season will have no effect as&#13;
the plowing season has passed.&#13;
46. Despite these objections to purchasing animals, the mission endorses the&#13;
allocation of some of the ERP funds to that purpose. The MOA has experience with&#13;
buying animals in relief situations and hence it has a well considered plan to procure&#13;
appropriate stock through auctions or local shopping. In addition, the MOA, the MOLG&#13;
and the relief authorities have identified farm families, including those who have returned&#13;
to the affected areas and those who are in camps, who can benefit most from the&#13;
distribution of stock. Distribution will be done with due regard to equity and productivity&#13;
considerations. Finally, the stock to be distributed - draft animals, sheep and goats,&#13;
poultry, and bees - are well known to the targeted farming groups, pose no problem in&#13;
terms of management with local technology and inputs, and are divisible with respect to&#13;
scale so that they can be efficiently used by small farmers, especially those headed by&#13;
women.&#13;
IV. Infrastructure Component: Roads&#13;
(US$ 36 million, of which IDA US$ 15 million)&#13;
47. Objective. The proposed roads infrastructure component is aimed at providing&#13;
emergency recovery assistance to the Government of Eritrea for (i) the&#13;
restoration/rehabilitation of key road and bridge facilities severely damaged by the war,&#13;
(ii) the restoration and provision of access to settlements/camps occupied, or to be&#13;
occupied by: (a) internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have also been impoverished&#13;
through loss of property and livelihood especially from the zobas (Administrative&#13;
Regions) of Gash-Barka and Debub, and (b) recent refugees in Sudan seeking to return&#13;
home to Eritrea, and long-standing refugees in Sudan whose return to Eritrea has been&#13;
hampered by the protracted 2-year border conflict; as well as (iii) provision of improved&#13;
access roads to areas of recurring drought and famine. The above objectives will&#13;
contribute to:&#13;
(isecuring the timely delivery of social services to the affected populations, by restoring&#13;
accessibility;&#13;
(ii) facilitating the re-settlement of war refugees into productive activities by restoring /&#13;
rehabilitating key sections of road and providing new road access and facilities;&#13;
(iii) stabilizing the ecosystem near the affected areas by arresting further deterioration of&#13;
enviromnental conditions;&#13;
(iv) reducing infrastructure-related market and distribution costs by reducing road transport&#13;
costs.&#13;
48. Description.. The war has damaged parts of the national and regional road&#13;
network with the destruction of key roads and bridges, severely hampering accessibility&#13;
and economic activity especially in the Zobas of Gash-Barka and Debub. The five sub-&#13;
components are aimed at the emergency restoration/rehabilitation of affected road and&#13;
bridge infrastructure:&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part 1. Repair of war-destroyed bridges and approachesThree critical bridges have been&#13;
destroyed: Tesseney Gash Bridge, Dassie-Awgaro Gash Bridge, and Kuluku Gash Bridge.&#13;
These bridges serve as the most vital supply route for relief materials to major cities, refugees&#13;
and IDP camps and settlements; and agricultural and pastoral areas mostly devastated by the&#13;
war. Restoration with Bailey bridges, along with road approaches to bridges was urgently&#13;
needed. Following the June 2000 mission, RTCD (Roads Transport Construction Division)&#13;
Units under the overall supervision of MOPW-Infrastructure Department engineers have&#13;
already repaired and installed the Tesseney Bridge over the Gash River. The restoration of the&#13;
other two bridges will depend on progress in the peace process.&#13;
Part 2. . Construction of one Bailey bridge and new access roads and&#13;
reconstruction/reshaping existing roads to serve new settlements The works will&#13;
comprise installation of a Bailey bridge and construction of associated abutments and&#13;
piers, as well as new access road construction along existing tracks and improvements of&#13;
existing roads leading to major new settlements. The works will be preceded by design of&#13;
the bridge abutments and piers. These include mainly:&#13;
(i) The links along the Central Belt : Akurdet - Kerkebet (110 km), Kerkebet - Zara&#13;
(80km), Zara - Melebso (lOOkm), Melebso - Afabet (60km), Afabet - Abarara (80km),&#13;
totaling 430km. In addition,&#13;
(ii) Minor links required to connect IDPs including Maiseraw - Alba (24km), Shebah -&#13;
Ghirghir (55km), Aderde - Shelab (13km), and Sawa - Moluber (45km), and totaling&#13;
137km; and&#13;
(iii) The proposal at appraisal was to improve the road connections from Barentu-&#13;
Awgaro, over the Dassie-Awgaro Gash bridge (to be reconstructed under Part 1 above),&#13;
with a link to Tokombiya, approximately 65 km. The MOPW-ID has proposed that this&#13;
road may be executed with a higher priority over the road no. (i) under Part 3, below,&#13;
unless GOE otherwise proposes a re-allocation of resources within the ERP for both&#13;
roads.&#13;
49.   The proposed works will comprise mainly grubbing, grading and partial filling&#13;
works including minor drainage structures and Irish crossings or fords.&#13;
Part 3. Construction of small bridges and culverts, and reshaping and widening of road&#13;
sections essential for ensuringaccess to poor communities chronically affected by drought&#13;
and famine. This component will include two major Belt Roads leading to drought and famine&#13;
areas and relief materials supply centers. The major road sections are as follows:&#13;
(i) North Eastern Belt: Abarara - Mahmimet - Karora (230 km), Afabet - Kubkub - Ma'amide&#13;
(55 km), totaling 285 km&#13;
(ii) Northern Belt: Selaa-Titay Damr-Kerkebet (130km), Kerkebet-Zara (80km), Zara-Hasta-&#13;
Itaro (100km), Itaro - Nakfa (90km), Nakfa - Afabet (66km), totaling 446 km.&#13;
50.   The total length of all these roads will be 731 km. Most of the works will include&#13;
grubbing, grading, and partial cut and fill works including minor drainage structures and&#13;
Irish crossings or fords.&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part 4. Procurement of Bailey Bridge Sections, Vehicles and Office Equipment. Under this&#13;
component two sets of items required for the works will be procured: (i) Bailey bridge sections&#13;
amounting to an extension of some 255 linear meters (lm)are being procured for rapid&#13;
reinstatement of bridge access. One Bailey bridge section (80T) that had been ordered at the&#13;
time of the June 2000 mission has been delivered and installed. The bridge sections would also&#13;
provide the needed capacity to MOPW-ID and RTCD for rapid response to emergency needs&#13;
requiring such bridge installation (ii) Two 4-wheel drive vehicles, and computers (7 no.) and&#13;
accessories for the MOPW-ID's management and supervision staff needs.&#13;
Part 5. Pre-constructionlnvestigations / Design and Construction Supervision. The&#13;
MOPW-ID expressed the need at appraisal for technical advisory services and consultant&#13;
support to manage the works program and to carry out pre-construction investigations&#13;
(including condition survey/inspection, design and contract documentation) and construction&#13;
supervision. This will comprise 48 person-months of technical advisory services (Highway&#13;
Design and Planning Engineer and Contract Implementation Specialist). In addition, MOPW-&#13;
ID will recruit local consultants to assist in carrying out these assignments. It is also expected&#13;
that Bailey bridge suppliers (e.g., Mabey) would provide expert supervision services during the&#13;
re-installation of such bridges, as required. In addition, MOPW-ID has firmed up proposals to&#13;
be presented to Government for MOPW-ID staffing reinstatement and strengthening to be&#13;
recruited from the professional and technical staff resources available in the country. The&#13;
services of a Social Scientist is also being acquired to assist in the supervision and monitoring&#13;
of the social impact of all operations and the public welfare elements of the program.&#13;

V.  Infrastructure: Power&#13;
(US$ 25 million, of which IDA 15 million)&#13;
51.   Objective. The goal of this component is to rehabilitate existing power plants,&#13;
whose functioning is critical for the resumption of economic and social activities.&#13;
52.   Description.. The project will finance the rehabilitation of (i) the Massawa&#13;
Hirgigo power plant, which forms the back-bone of the Eritrean power system, supplying&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a vast area comprising Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Keren and Dekemhare, and which&#13;
alone suffered an estimated US$ 18 million worth of damage during the recent conflict;&#13;
(ii) the replacement of power generators in Barentu and Tesseney, in Western Eritrea; and&#13;
(iii) repairs to the electrical power systems in Adi-Quala, Adi Keih, and Senafe.&#13;
53.   IDA contribution will only finance the rehabilitation of the Massawa Hirgigo&#13;
power plant. Damages to this power plant include:&#13;
*  132/66/15KV substation switchgear&#13;
*  local control rooms for diesel generators units N.3 and N. 4&#13;
*  cladding of the power house, south side&#13;
*  stacks for engines N. 1 and N. 2&#13;
*  minor damages to mechanical and electrical equipment and storage area&#13;
VI. Private Sector Reconstruction&#13;
(US$ 45 million, of which IDA US$ 30 million)&#13;
54.   Objective. The goal of this component is to jumpstart the private sector,&#13;
especially the formal private sector by providing relief to enterprises that have been&#13;
particularly affected by the conflict; and by making foreign exchange, which has been&#13;
particularly scarce, available through the banking system.&#13;
55.   Description. The Private Sector Reconstruction Component of ERP consists of&#13;
three parts:&#13;
Part 1: Support For Affected Enterprises (US$ 15 million, of which IDA US$ 10 million) to&#13;
enable Commercial Bank of Eritrea (CBE), Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea (HCBE)&#13;
and the Eritrea Development and Investment Bank (EDIB) to provide debt service relief to their&#13;
borrowers who are affected by the recent war with Ethiopia.&#13;
56.   Focus of SAE. The scope of SAE is confined to only those enterprises which had&#13;
borrowed funds from the three banks. With nearly one third of the country's population&#13;
reported to be displaced, it would take several months, and maybe years, to ascertain the&#13;
actual damage caused by the war. This would necessarily involve a laborious and time&#13;
consuming assessment of the losses incurred by individual borrowers, many of whom are&#13;
not currently traceable. Nor is it the intention of this component to compensate borrowers&#13;
for all their losses. Details obtained on the value of collateral for bank loans would&#13;
suggest that the assets of affected enterprises were at least twice the amount of loans that&#13;
were obtained by these enterprises. For instance, the aggregate investments in 47 affected&#13;
enterprises in the portfolio of EDIB was ERN 66.5 million, against which the total&#13;
outstanding loan balance was ERN 21.1 million as of June 30, 2000. The value of&#13;
collateral in respect of 350 loans to affected enterprises in HCBE's portfolio was twice&#13;
the amount of outstanding balance of ERN 24.97 million. It will take some time to obtain&#13;
similar details in respect of the 2,570 affected enterprises in CBE's portfolio, which had&#13;
an outstanding loan balance of ERN 289.48 million as of June 30, 2000. With the&#13;
prevalent emphasis on collateral of all banking institutions in Eritrea, it would be&#13;
surprising if the CBE portfolio is any different.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57.   Thus, while the assets owned (and presumably lost) by enterprises would be much&#13;
larger than the aggregate outstanding bank loans, SAE will only provide relief, by way of&#13;
total or partial debt forgiveness, total or partial waiver of accumulated interest, and in&#13;
cases where the damage is minimal, just a rescheduling of debt service payments. What is&#13;
done in each particular case would very much depend on the circumstances of that&#13;
particular case. Because of the banking practices in Eritrea, it is unlikely that the same&#13;
enterprise would figure as the client of more than one bank. However, to ensure a&#13;
harmonization of terms and to ensure that persons or firms in similar circumstances are&#13;
treated alike, it is proposed to set up a coordinating committee of the three banks. The&#13;
committee, consisting of the heads of credit departments, will meet periodically to&#13;
exchange information on procedures of each institution in providing financial relief to&#13;
affected customers.&#13;
58.   Financial Relief to affected Enterprises. To ascertain the extent of financial&#13;
relief that may be needed by affected enterprises, the three banks were asked to make&#13;
estimates of the following:&#13;
Category 1- Loans where the collateral assets have been fully or significantly destroyed;&#13;
Category 2- Loans where the damage to collateral assets is minimal, but the owners have been&#13;
killed or displaced or are not traceable; and&#13;
Category 3- Loans where the collateral assets are intact, owners are in place but the units are&#13;
not operating at full capacity because the workers have been mobilized by the military and are,&#13;
therefore, not available to operate the units.&#13;
Preliminary assessments indicate the following position:&#13;
Bank  Enterprises Category 1   Category 2   Category 3      Total&#13;
Number  --------------( ERN million )-------------------------&#13;
CBE    2570.0        206.37         19.66       67.89         293.92&#13;
HCBE    350.0           5.57         15.95       3.31          24.83&#13;
EIDB      47.0         6.59           0.87      13.65          21.11&#13;
For purposes of estimating the aggregate financial relief which the three banks may have to&#13;
extend to affected enterprises, the following assumptions were made:&#13;
Category 1: Total debt forgiveness&#13;
Category 2: Debt write off, on an average, of 75 percent of outstanding loan balance&#13;
Category 3: Waiver of interest, on an average, for 3 years ( 27 percent in all at 9 percent pa).&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59.  In view of the large number of loan accounts in its portfolio, CBE will need&#13;
additional time to come up with such categorization. As nearly ERN 137 million of its&#13;
affected portfolio is for the agriculture sector, where the prospects of recovery of&#13;
outstanding loans are slim, it was assumed that CBE would have to extend financial relief&#13;
to the extent of 75 percent of the outstanding loan balance.&#13;
60.   As the purpose of SAE is to assist banks to extend financial relief to affected&#13;
enterprises, but not to bail out banks in respect of their non-performing assets before the&#13;
war, an exercise was undertaken to identify loan loss provisions pertaining to affected&#13;
enterprises as of December 31, 1999. Specific provisions already made in the balance&#13;
sheets of the banks were deducted from the estimates of relief that may be extended to the&#13;
enterprises. Where there were no specific provisions, approximate calculations were&#13;
made based on the proportion of affected portfolio to the total portfolio. The following&#13;
table indicates the financial assistance needed by the three banks to be able to provide the&#13;
envisaged relief to affected enterprises:&#13;
Bank    Affected    Amount of   Provision        Amount under&#13;
portfolio     relief    for bad debts    ERP&#13;
(ERN million)&#13;
CBE     293.92        239.45      70.20          169.25&#13;
HCBE    24.97          18.48       0.35           18.13&#13;
EIDB     21.11         10.92      0.28            10.64&#13;
Total   340.00        268.85      70.83          198.20&#13;
61.   These figures are based on estimates which will be finalized shortly. In the&#13;
meantime, it is proposed that the size of the SAE component is fixed at US$15 million;&#13;
and these funds would be made available by GOE to the three banks roughly as shown in&#13;
the table above, in the form of subordinated loans, with interest adjustments being made&#13;
depending on the actual financial relief extended by the banks to affected enterprises.&#13;
62.   Subordinated Loans. The SAE component will be implemented through&#13;
subordinated loans. There are several reasons for recommending that the funds under the&#13;
SAE component are passed on to the banks in the form of subordinated loans. The&#13;
objective of ERP is not to solve the long-term problem relating to the financial structure&#13;
of CBE and HCBE which are both under-capitalized. Subordinated debt, with a fixed&#13;
maturity profile, underscores the transitional nature of the assistance, while restoring the&#13;
financial resources needed by the banks to provide the debt service relief needed by their&#13;
customers affected by the war. Simultaneously, the terms of the subordinated debt are&#13;
structured in a way to make them eligible for inclusion as Tier 2 Capital as defined in the&#13;
draft guidelines on Capital Adequacy prepared by the Bank of Eritrea. HCBE is wholly&#13;
owned by a non-governmental source; and funds provided by GOE in the form of&#13;
subordinated debt would not alter the ownership structure. IDA will disburse SAE funds&#13;
to be in tranches: the first 25percent on loan effectiveness; and the remaining funds in&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
several tranches on receipt of quarterly diagnostic reports from each of the three banks&#13;
giving an up-to-date review of the affected portfolio, an estimate of the damages, and&#13;
details of the financial relief extended to affected enterprises. The banks will pay GOE&#13;
interest on subordinated debt at rates equivalent to 180 days Treasury Bills rate, so that&#13;
there is no burden on GOE finances. The subordinated debt will be paid by the banks in&#13;
20 years including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;
Part 2: A Loan Fund US$ 27 million, of which IDA US$ 18 million) to provide the&#13;
three banks with the resources needed to extend medium and long term loans to their&#13;
private sector clients.&#13;
63.   Focus of the Loan Fund. The objective of the Loan Fund is to increase the&#13;
supply of both foreign exchange and term financing to private sector enterprises in&#13;
Eritrea. By helping to alleviate the financial and foreign exchange constraints on these&#13;
enterprises, it is anticipated that many will be able to develop and grow and thus generate&#13;
production and employment. The Loan Fund is designed to increase the supply of term&#13;
funding at market rates to the banking system to enable them to meet the legitimate&#13;
investment needs of the private sector.&#13;
64.   The focus of the Loan will be mainly on the revival of private sector activity&#13;
which is very much affected by the war. The loan effectiveness conditions and eligibility&#13;
criteria will not include policy and institutional reforms in the financial sector. It has,&#13;
however, been ascertained during preparation of this operation that satisfactory progress&#13;
has been made in instituting such reforms.&#13;
65.   The Loan Fund will be channeled through the three banks, to finance the fixed&#13;
investment and permanent working capital needs of viable private enterprises including&#13;
associated training and consultancy services as needed. There will be no sectoral&#13;
limitation, except the customary negative list of prohibited activities such as tobacco,&#13;
firearms, real estate and mortgage transactions, and there will be no relaxation in&#13;
applying the appraisal standards to determine the viability of projects. In view of the&#13;
acute foreign exchange situation which Eritrea is facing, a priority for allocation of loan&#13;
funds would be the needs for import of machinery and components by existing&#13;
enterprises, and new enterprises which have the potential to earn or save hard currency.&#13;
66.   Size of the Loan Fund.   As regards the size of the Loan Fund, a quick review&#13;
of medium and long term credit demands by war affected enterprises, agriculture and&#13;
manufacturing sector would indicate a demand of around ERN 650 million over a two&#13;
year period, or roughly ERN 325 million annually. About 50percent of this demand is&#13;
estimated to be in hard currency. This would justify the size of the Loan Fund of US$27&#13;
million to meet the needs of the private sector. The underlying assumption is that the&#13;
remainder of the medium and term needs, particularly local currency needs, can be met&#13;
from domestic resources of the banking sector.&#13;
67.   Design of the Loan Fund. Although policy and institutional reforms are not the&#13;
focus of ERP, it has been ascertained that satisfactory progress has been achieved in&#13;
many key areas. The central bank has drafted guidelines on capital adequacy ratio and&#13;
loan classification. CBE and EDIB have both prepared draft strategic plans and HCBE is&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
currently engaged in such an exercise. Both CBE and HCBE have satisfactory&#13;
arrangements for external audit. In fact, KPMG, which is the auditor of CBE, has assisted&#13;
the bank in a thorough evaluation of the portfolio, and as a result, CBE's financial&#13;
statements for December 1999 are expected to make an adequate provision for bad and&#13;
doubtful debts. EDIB has a strong capital adequacy ratio (40 percent). The ratios of CBE&#13;
and HCBE were 7.0 percent and 3.9 percent as of June 2000. These are expected to&#13;
improve somewhat, after the infusion of Tier 2 capital by the end of 2000. These ratios&#13;
are tolerable, given the current adverse circumstances. It should, however, be made clear&#13;
to GOE, Bank of Eritrea and the three banks that access to the Loan Fund under the ERP&#13;
would not automatically lead to eligibility under future Bank operations. To be eligible,&#13;
the banks would have to demonstrate that they satisfy all the CAMEL criteria for&#13;
creditworthiness and that they are in full compliance with all central bank prudential&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
68.   Operating Procedures of the Loan Fund. The important features of the on-&#13;
lending arrangements for the Loan Fund are as follows:&#13;
69.   Foreign exchange risks to be borne by GOE. Loans to banks will be denominated&#13;
in local currency, as will the loans to sub-borrowers. However, the sub-borrowers will&#13;
have automatic access to foreign exchange for imports, up to the limits of sub-loans.&#13;
70.   Banks will be charged an interest rate based on the marginal cost of funding&#13;
within the banking system, as determined by the Bank of Eritrea. The banks would be&#13;
free to charge a rate, fixed or variable, depending on the costs and risks involved.&#13;
71.   Banks will receive loans for 10 years. In turn, they would be free to determine the&#13;
maturity of sub-loans, in a 4-10 year range, depending on the cash flow needs of the sub-&#13;
projects. Most loans are expected to be between 4-5 years and banks will be allowed to&#13;
revolve these funds.&#13;
72.   The maximum amount of a loan to a single project will not exceed ERN 15&#13;
million. This limit can be exceeded only with a no-objection from the Governor of the&#13;
Bank of Eritrea and IDA. The maximum exposure of a bank in a single enterprise&#13;
(including all types of loans, advances and credit facilities granted to the enterprise and&#13;
all related enterprises) will be governed by the Prudential Exposure Limits in Bank of&#13;
Eritrea Proclamation.&#13;
73.   The Loan Fund will be tranched. Before IDA approves the first tranche of the&#13;
Loan Fund, each Participating Financial Institution (PFI) will be required to sign a&#13;
Participation Agreement with the Bank of Eritrea. Each bank will also be required to&#13;
submit a medium-term strategic plan outlining, among others, operational goals,&#13;
recruitment of staff and staff development, profitability, quality of portfolio and financial&#13;
condition. This will permit the PFIs to access up to US$9 million (the first trench) from&#13;
the Fund. Progress will be reviewed six months after effectiveness and the review will&#13;
assess the compliance of each of the PFIs with the prudential guidelines of BE and the&#13;
PFI's plan. Access to the second trench of US$9 million will depend upon satisfactory&#13;
compliance by each PFI with their strategic plan - whether or not the PFI participated in&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the utilization of the first trench of funding. The third and final trench of $9 million will&#13;
be available one year after effectiveness, pending satisfactory progress.&#13;
74.   Disbursement from the PSR Unit will be made to PFIs on the same basis as funds&#13;
are made available by the PFIs to the sub-projects. However, once these funds have been&#13;
made available to each PFI, they can be reused for subsequent longer-term lending as&#13;
required (although subsequent access to foreign exchange will be constrained by the&#13;
central bank's capacity to provide foreign exchange to longer-term investors). Repayment&#13;
to the PSR Unit in the Bank of Eritrea will be based upon a ten-year repayment schedule&#13;
from the PFI based on equal monthly payments (with an initial blanket two-year grace&#13;
period during which interest, but not principal, will be paid), as agreed with the central&#13;
bank. Subsequent repayments from the central bank to the Government will be based&#13;
upon a 15-year repayment schedule.&#13;
75.   The Loan Fund will be managed by the PSR Unit in the Bank of Eritrea, and&#13;
managed by PFIs at sub-borrower level. The Bank of Eritrea will sign a Participation&#13;
Agreement with each PFI.&#13;

Guidelines on Policies and Operating Procedures for Investment Fund&#13;
OPERtATING CHARACTERISTIC UIDELINES&#13;
PSR Unit Administration             To be housed within the Bank of Eritrea and supervised by expert to&#13;
be recruited on bank supervision.&#13;
Interest Rate Charged by the BE to PFIs Funds will be provided to the PFIs from the Bank of Eritrea (BE) at the&#13;
marginal cost of funding within the banking system, and maintained at&#13;
positive real levels. This rate will be reviewed by the BE.&#13;
Interest Rate Charged by PFIs to sub-borr PFIs would be free to charge an interest rate, fixed or variable, on&#13;
sub-loans commensurate with the costs and risks involved.&#13;
Interest Rate Review Mechanism      The interest rate mechanisms described above will be reviewed&#13;
periodically and adjusted as appropriate to ensure that deposit and&#13;
lending rates remain positive in real terms.&#13;
Currency of Sub-loans               Commitments, disbursements and repayments would be in Eritrean nakfa -&#13;
but the sub-boffowers would have automatic access to foreign exchange for&#13;
imports. Withdrawal applications from the Special Account would be&#13;
made in the US$ equivalent of the Eritrean nakfa amount.&#13;
Maturity of Sub-loans                Loan terms on investment lending would be determined by the banks&#13;
but will generally be between 4 to 10 years - with most lending between&#13;
4 to 5 years. The PSR Unit would be required to provide funding for a ten&#13;
year period to each PFI. In exceptional circumstances, such as the&#13;
construction of industrial estates, loans from the Unit and the PFI's can&#13;
range up to 15 years maturity.&#13;
Grace Period                        Grace periods will be determined by the commercial banks in conformity&#13;
with the projected cash flow of the sub-projects. The grace period (on&#13;
principal only) to the PFIs from the Bank of Eritrea would be a standard&#13;
two years on all loans made.&#13;
Maximum Sub-loan Size               The maximum amount of a loan to a single project will not exceed ERN&#13;
15 million. This limit can be exceeded only with a no-objection from the&#13;
Governor of the Bank of Eritrea and IDA, Maximum loan to a single&#13;
borrower or related group of borrowers would be determined by the&#13;
Financial Institutions Act.&#13;
Viability of Projects               The viability of the projects will be determined by the PFI making the&#13;
oan. Sub-project viability will not be subject to review by the central&#13;
bank's PSR Unit.&#13;
Minimum Contribution by Sub-Borrower As determined by the financial intermediary.&#13;
Request for Funds                   PFIs request for funding to the PSR Unit would be in summary form&#13;
providing data on the name, size, location and sector of the firm and&#13;
nature of the sub-project, level of financing and the names of all&#13;
principals. Detailed financial data would not be included.&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eligible Sectors                   Finance will be made available to all sectors of the economy for any&#13;
ommercially oriented private enterprise, of any size, that will create&#13;
alue added within the economy. However, tobacco, firearms, and&#13;
residential real estate are on a negative list.&#13;
Eligible Expenditures              Finance will be provided for both working capital and fixed investment.&#13;
Refmancing of existing sub-loans would not be eligible except in&#13;
xceptional circumstances. Sub-borrowers with non-performing loans in&#13;
any financial institution would not be granted loans under the Project.&#13;
Ex-post review                     All reviews by the PSR Unit and by IDA would be on an ex-post basis.&#13;
Any projects not processed in conformity with the criteria of eligible sectors&#13;
would be re-financed by the PFI from their own funds in foreign exchange.&#13;
udit Requirements                 Loan Fund Account audited annually as part of the whole Project audits;&#13;
PFIs must submit audits annually to the PSR Unit;&#13;
Statement of Expenditures of PFIs subject to random audits;&#13;
Random ex-post reviews conducted on individual sub-loans to ensure&#13;
ompliance with disbursement requirements; the 1999 accounts and all&#13;
ubsequent annual audited financial statements should be made available&#13;
within no more than six months after the end of the financial year.&#13;
Procurement                         ocurement of sub-loan projects follows private sector commercial&#13;
ractices.&#13;
Disbursement                       n accordance with the submission of subproject documentation (kept by&#13;
he PFI) and a Statement of Expenditure submitted by the PFI to the PSR&#13;
_          ~~~~Unit.&#13;
Sub-Project Documentation          Each sub-project would be required to submit to the PFI a project&#13;
ummary containing the following information: (i) Name and address of&#13;
borrower; (ii) sector of firm; (iii) number of employees; (iv) financial&#13;
statements acceptable to PFI; (v) description of financing and subproject;&#13;
and (vi) maturity and term of financing.&#13;
Early Warning System               The PFI would also be expected to report material changes in any of the&#13;
above information. In addition, the PFI would be expected to provide&#13;
monthly information on loan performance - repayments and/or non-&#13;
repayments of principal and/or interest - to the Bank of Eritrea. On a six&#13;
monthly basis, the PFIs would be expected to provide a short write up on&#13;
any non-performing, or poorly performing, credits. This report should&#13;
identify any issues which may have impacted the viability of the&#13;
operation and hence the repayment of the loan. Where problems are&#13;
dentified with particular projects, the PFI would be expected to develop&#13;
a remedial action plan which would be provided to the PSR Unit and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
Technical Assistance               Should the consultants envisaged under the TA component for the PFIs&#13;
not be in place within three months of loan effectiveness, the Government&#13;
and IDA would jointly review the eligibility of the PFI in the Loan Fund.&#13;
Environment                        Environmental Assessment for each sub-loan will follow the Impact&#13;
Assessment Guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment&#13;
under the Ministry of Land, Water and the Environment.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part 3: A Technical Assistance Program (US $3 million, of which IDA US$ 2 million) to&#13;
strengthen the supervision, auditing and accounting function of Bank of Eritrea; and the project&#13;
appraisal/credit assessment capacity of CBE and HCBE.&#13;
76.   The Need for Technical Assistance. The successful implementation of the Loan&#13;
Fund would depend on the ability of the three banks to allocate credit to enterprises based&#13;
on a critical assessment of long term credit risks; and the ability of the Bank of Eritrea to&#13;
exercise its prudential control over the banking institutions which it is supposed to&#13;
regulate. Because of historical circumstances, none of these institutions has been able to&#13;
acquire, in sufficient numbers, managerial staff with the requisite competence, experience&#13;
and judgement. A temporary solution would be to install a team of advisers who could&#13;
give a helping hand to the senior managers of the banking institutions in preparing&#13;
operational manuals and installing procedures in the short term, and instituting a system&#13;
of on-the-job training when the situation becomes normal. In this context, it is highly&#13;
desirable that all the elements included in the Financial Sector Capacity Building&#13;
component of PSR are brought forward, with minor modifications, under the Private&#13;
Sector Reconstruction component of ERP.&#13;
77.  Scope of the TA Program. The essential elements of the Technical Assistance&#13;
Program in the current operation would include the following:&#13;
78.  For Bank of Eritrea: (a) One expert for 12 months to draft and issue banking&#13;
regulations; (b) Bank supervision expert for 2 years to provide on the job training.&#13;
79.   For CBE: (a) One senior Operational Advisor, who can draft operational policies&#13;
and procedures for all activities other than credit supervision, for 18 months,(b) One&#13;
senior Credit Specialist and two experts in project appraisal/credit analysis for 18 months;&#13;
(c) One expert in international banking for 18 months; and (d) One MIS/Computer&#13;
systems expert for 18 months.&#13;
80.   For HCBE: One senior Credit Specialist and one project appraisal/credit analysis&#13;
expert for 12 months.&#13;
81.   For EDIB: One Senior Operations Advisor for 18 months.&#13;
VII. Social Protection&#13;
(US$ 41 million, of which IDA 8.5 million)&#13;
82.   Objectives. The social protection component of the ERP aims to target the&#13;
urgent social and economic needs of vulnerable households and poor communities, and&#13;
help them recover from the consequences of both war and draught. The component&#13;
specifically addresses the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure in those rural areas most&#13;
affected by the fighting, and the rapid improvement of employment prospects and&#13;
income-generating capacity of small affected business and individuals.&#13;
83.   Description. The Social Protection component of ERP will achieve its intended&#13;
objectives by financing three sub-components:&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A. Replenishing the existing Eritrea Community Development Fund (ECDF), in particular&#13;
its two sub-components:&#13;
(i) Basic social infrastructure (US$ 21 million, of which IDA 6.5)&#13;
(ii) Micro-Credit component (US$ 2 million, IDA 2 million).&#13;
84.   Rationale. In order to respond to the dramatic humanitarian crisis affecting&#13;
Eritrea since May 2000, the Bank acted quickly to provide immediate assistance to the&#13;
Government, by reallocating funds from its existing portfolio towards those areas of&#13;
highest priority. While remaining in line with the project's overall development&#13;
objectives, US$ 3.7 million equivalent were immediately reallocated from the ongoing&#13;
ECDF project - IDA Cr. 28230 - in order to finance emergency water supply and&#13;
sanitation sub-projects in poor areas with high concentrations of IDPs.&#13;
85.   ECDF's targeted beneficiaries are precisely those rural communities that are most&#13;
heavily suffering the consequences of war and drought. It was therefore envisaged that&#13;
channeling new resources through ECDF would be the most effective way to timely&#13;
address the plight of these vulnerable groups. ECDF already has the knowledge and the&#13;
proven capacity to successfully implement communities sub-projects, let alone&#13;
substantial experience with World Bank's procedures.&#13;
86.   Background. The first Eritrea Community Rehabilitation Fund was established as&#13;
a pilot within the first Recovery and Rehabilitation Program for Eritrea, to test the&#13;
effectiveness of community-driven mechanisms in improving the economic and social&#13;
conditions of people living in the poorest and most devastated areas of the country. Upon&#13;
satisfactory completion of the pilot phase, in 1996 the expanded Eritrea Community&#13;
Development Fund (ECDF) was approved, for a period of five years. The first phase of&#13;
ECDF will eventually reach completion in FY2002 (closing date December 31, 2001). At&#13;
this stage, already 87 percent of the loan has been disbursed. Hence, due to its successful&#13;
impact and performance, the Government of Eritrea has expressed its support for&#13;
extending ECDF beyond its current phase. Its two main sub-components (basic&#13;
infrastructure and micro-credit) will be both incorporated in a broader Community&#13;
Development Project (CDP), currently under preparation. In the interim period until CDP&#13;
is effective, the ERP will therefore provide an important source of bridge financing for&#13;
ECDF.&#13;
87.   Objectives. ECDF's objective is to finance community-driven sub-projects which&#13;
will: (i) support the rehabilitation and development of basic social and economic&#13;
infrastructure (health centers, schools, market places, water supplies etc.), while fostering&#13;
community participation in the design, implementation, and maintenance of these&#13;
infrastructures; (ii) improve the income-generating capacity of poor people and&#13;
households, while contributing to the broadening of Eritrea's financial institutions; and&#13;
(iii) create local capacity among communities to identify their own development needs&#13;
and priorities, manage project implementation, and maintain their assets, in line with the&#13;
Government's overall decentralization strategy.&#13;
88.   Description. The ECDF is a demand-driven program, financing selected sub-&#13;
projects which have been identified and requested by poor local communities. ECDF&#13;
regional offices appraise sub-projects applications on the basis of their sustainability,&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
their economic and social return, their environmental impact, and their consistency with&#13;
the Government's sectoral development strategies. The ECDF does not directly&#13;
implement projects. Rather, it supports the efforts of local communities by providing&#13;
technical guidance and expertise in project management and implementation.&#13;
89.   ECDF has two main components:&#13;
(i) Social and economic infrastructure and services. ECDF finances economic and social&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects in the following categories: primary health (e.g. health&#13;
stations, health centers and health posts); basic education (e.g. primary and junior&#13;
secondary schools); rural water supply (e.g. safe water bore-holes and wells); soil, water&#13;
and forestry conservation; and rural feeder roads. For each of these categories, ECDF&#13;
supports the rehabilitation, expansion and construction of facilities, as well as furniture,&#13;
equipment and some training costs. In order to strengthen ownership, communities are&#13;
requested to provide at least a 10 percent contribution to the project implementation costs&#13;
(either in kind, in cash or in labor). ECDF includes a number of capacity building&#13;
activities. These mainly consist of technical training programs for ECDF staff, Ministry&#13;
of Local Government staff and sector Ministry staff, and local communities, to ensure the&#13;
effective implementation, and long-term sustainability of Fund activities.&#13;
(ii) The Micro-Credit Component This program provides access to small credit to&#13;
individuals/groups living in the poor rural areas. There are two windows of credit under this&#13;
scheme: (i) the Village Banks Savings and Credit program provides loans to individuals up to&#13;
US$ 1,000, repayable over two years, and currently operates in 5 regions. The loan is agreed on&#13;
the condition that the borrower has a proven savings record of at least three months. Borrowers&#13;
are asked to get together into solidarity groups. In this system, each group member is&#13;
responsible for the repayment of loans defaulted on by other group members, while no member&#13;
is given access to new credit until all loans have been repaid. (ii) the Tier-Two program&#13;
provides up to US$ 10,000 loans to small enterprises, upon condition that the borrowed money&#13;
is invested in profitable projects benefiting the entire community.&#13;
90.   Activities to be financed under the ERP. In light of the latest emergency, the&#13;
replenished funds going to ECDF will be used to finance the following set of activities&#13;
under sub-components (i) and (ii), including technical assistance and capacity building&#13;
related to both activities.&#13;
(i) Basic Social Infrastructure. ECDF, in consultation with the relevant line Ministries, will&#13;
be the implementing agency directly responsible for the reconstruction of all basic social&#13;
infrastructure in the war-affected areas. The reconstruction plan prepared by ECDF reflects the&#13;
Government's official Damage Assessment report. It includes:&#13;
*  Education. rehabilitation and refurbishment of schools in the Gash Barka and Debub&#13;
region, the construction of makeshift classrooms, a teachers training center, and the&#13;
provision of schools supplies.&#13;
*  Health: health facilities in affected areas.&#13;
*  Access Roads: rehabilitation of small feeder roads in areas serving refugee camps and&#13;
returnee locations - Debub, Semeinawi, and Gash Barka.&#13;
*  Water Supply: construction of three water supply schemes in the Debub area - Adi Keith,&#13;
Segheneiti, and Dibarwa - which have recently received considerable influxes of deportees&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
from Ethiopia, and have been stricken by low rains. Besides financing drilling and civil&#13;
works, the allocation will cover the costs of a geo-physical survey and equipment.&#13;
(ii) The Micro-Credit Program.&#13;
*  The Village Banks Savings and Credit Program. In the first emergency phase (FY01), Tier&#13;
One will be refinanced so that 16 Village Banks will be created in addition to the existing&#13;
86 - 3 will be in the Gash Barka and 10 in the Debub region. Subsequently (FY 2002), an&#13;
additional 35 Village Banks will be established across all regions. The total projected&#13;
number of new Tier I beneficiaries by then would be 1750 people, bringing the total number&#13;
of Tier I beneficiaries to 4,369.&#13;
*  The Tier Two Credit Program . This Program will also be refinanced so as to benefit an&#13;
additional 169 clients by the end of FY02, bringing the total number of beneficiaries of Tier&#13;
lI to 272.&#13;
*  B. Housing Program (US$10 million, no IDA financing). Many households lost&#13;
their houses and all their belongings during the war. The project will provide&#13;
materials to subsidize the cost of rebuilding the houses of approximately 20,000 poor&#13;
households. Special attention will be given to ensure that the process of rebuilding&#13;
houses does not have a negative impact on the already poor natural resource base of&#13;
the country. In this respect alternative options for provision and distribution of&#13;
materials, or construction of houses, are being considered and will be tested, initially&#13;
on a pilot basis. The Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) will be responsible for&#13;
overall coordination, implementation and monitoring of this component. A special&#13;
unit within MOLG (ERP Desk) will be responsible for designing suitable housing&#13;
prototypes which respect different cultural and environmental situations. MOLG&#13;
regional and sub-regional offices will be responsible for identifying beneficiaries in&#13;
each affected area, and mobilizing communities in the rebuilding process.&#13;
&#149;  C. Safety Nets Program (US$8 Million, no IDA financing). This component will&#13;
include the financing of various traditional safety nets, to be implemented at the&#13;
community level. These may include cash transfers (grants) to households&#13;
particularly affected by the war, which will be identified on the basis of a set of&#13;
eligibility criteria established by the GOE. Such grants will be repayable in two&#13;
yearly installments without interests. However, other approaches, such as cash for&#13;
work schemes, will also be considered, depending on their regional suitability. The&#13;
regional offices of the MOLG, in cooperation with sub-regional and village&#13;
administration offices, will be responsible for setting eligibility criteria, identifying&#13;
beneficiaries, implementing and monitoring the program.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROGRAM&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.   Program Implementation Period&#13;
91.   The implementation timeframe for the Program will be two years (December&#13;
2000 - December 2002).&#13;
II.  Program Implementation and Coordination.&#13;
92.   The Eritrea Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP) will be coordinated by a&#13;
Program Management Unit (PMU) established within the Ministry of Finance. The PMU&#13;
will be responsible for overall program management, including ensuring that financial&#13;
management and reporting procedures will be acceptable to the government, the Bank&#13;
and other cooperating partners. A PMU Manager, a Finance Officer and Procurement&#13;
Officer have already been appointed. They would form the core team of the PMU. A&#13;
Steering Committee under the chairmanship of the Director General, Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and consisting of Director Generals of all implementing sector ministries&#13;
will oversee implementation of the program and make policy decisions on issues related&#13;
to implementation effectiveness.&#13;
93.   The actual implementation of individual components will be the responsibility of&#13;
the relevant line ministries or government agencies, in particular: Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(agriculture), Ministry of Energy (energy), Ministry of Public Works (road and bridge&#13;
rehabilitation), Ministry of Local Government (ECDF, traditional safety nets and&#13;
housing), Ministry of Finance (BOP support), and the Bank of Eritrea (private sector&#13;
reconstruction).&#13;
94.   The establishment of successful mechanisms to coordinate inputs and&#13;
contributions being provided by different development partners will be key to the success&#13;
of the project. The Government stressed the importance of adopting harmonized&#13;
procedures for procurement, financial management, and reporting. A meeting with all&#13;
concerned development partners was convened during the appraisal mission to agree on&#13;
common implementation procedures.&#13;
III. Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
95.   Procurement. Particular care has been given to procurement arrangements under&#13;
the program, in order to assure an immediate but transparent response to the emergency&#13;
situation. Implementation will have to be fast, efficient and transparent throughout the&#13;
program and, for that purpose, a "Manual ofprocurement procedures under ERP" has&#13;
been drafted by the Borrower in coordination with the Bank. The manual, which will be&#13;
adopted by other Participating Partners (PPs), thus allowing harmonization of&#13;
procurement procedures, incorporates a wide range of procurement methods which will&#13;
be used for the procurement of commodities, goods, works and consulting services.&#13;
Under ERP, most of the procurement methods will not be subject to specific monetary&#13;
thresholds, giving the borrower the option to choose the most suitable procurement&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
method for any given case and use easily accessible procedures such as (i) national&#13;
regulations (previously reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable) for works and&#13;
procurement of locally manufactured goods; (ii) commercial practices, mostly for the&#13;
procurement of food and agricultural commodities both from the intemational and&#13;
national markets, and (iii) simplified ICB, LIB and international shopping for the&#13;
procurement of goods manufactured abroad. Bid document clauses concerning advance&#13;
payment, price adjustment and currency have been upgraded, in line with Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, to facilitate the mobilization of national contractors. Emergency&#13;
procurement methods such as direct contracting, force account, auction purchase and sole&#13;
source will be used whenever immediate procurement action will be necessary such as&#13;
for rehabilitation of bailey bridges destroyed during the recent war, emergency water&#13;
supply /sanitation for overcrowded border towns and camps; and for local breeds of&#13;
livestock. In the case of consulting assignments, national procedures consistent with IDA&#13;
guidelines will be used. Most of the short-term assignments will be awarded using&#13;
shortlists of national consultants and the "Qualifications" selection method. "Quality and&#13;
Cost" based selection will be limited to long-term, time-based assignments and&#13;
recruitment of international firms. Finally, emergency procurement for immediate needs&#13;
and rehabilitation, for an amount of US$35 million is already under way and will be&#13;
subject to retroactive financing. Prior review by the Bank will be limited to higher cost&#13;
contracts (more than US$3 million for both goods and works) procured through&#13;
simplified ICB and consulting contracts (for firms) above the threshold of US$300,000,&#13;
in addition to all TORs and to the scheduling of procurement activities under the&#13;
program. Audit of the procurement actions will be carried out at regular intervals by both&#13;
internal and external auditors in addition to Bank/PPs' procurement and disbursement&#13;
audits.&#13;
96.   Disbursement. The credit will finance 100 percent of:(i) foreign expenditures&#13;
and ex-factory prices (ii) foreign and local consultant services (iii) Loans and Sub-loans&#13;
under the Private sector Reconstruction Component (iv) Micro-credit sub-loans under the&#13;
Social Protection Component. The credit will finance 95 percent of all other local&#13;
expenditures. The disbursement schedule will be as follows: 45 percent of the credit is&#13;
expected to be disbursed during FY01 (including 35 percent retroactive financing); 40&#13;
percent is expected to be disbursed during FY02; and the remaining 15 percent during&#13;
FY03.&#13;
IV. Financial Management, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
97.   Financial Management. The PMU, under the direction of the Finance Officer,&#13;
would maintain records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices, the operations, resources, and expenditures of the program. The Unit will set up&#13;
and maintain a program-specific accounting and financial management system adequate&#13;
to provide complete, accurate and timely information regarding program resources and&#13;
expenditures. Agreement has been obtained from all the implementing partners to&#13;
harmonize the financial reporting for the program; in this regard, a quarterly progress&#13;
report will be distributed to all the implementing agencies as part of program monitoring.&#13;
A financial management specialist has conducted an assessment during the program&#13;
appraisal mission. His findings confirm government's preference for a harmonized&#13;
system.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98.   Auditing. The accounts of the program will be audited annually in accordance&#13;
with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied. Agreement has been obtained to&#13;
prepare a consolidated annual report to satisfy the requirements of all the implementing&#13;
partners. In addition to the audit reports, the auditors will also prepare a Management&#13;
Letter giving comments and observations, and make recommendations for improvements&#13;
on accounting records, systems, controls, and compliance with financial covenants.&#13;
99.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive Financing refers to the Credit amount which&#13;
the Bank agrees to reimburse to the Borrower for expenditures incurred during a certain&#13;
period prior to the date of Credit effectiveness. World Bank guidelines for Emergency&#13;
Loans limit the amount eligible for Retroactive Financing to 20 percent. However, given&#13;
the particular circumstances in Eritrea, and the need for the Government to intervene&#13;
immediately in some critical areas - e.g. roads and bridges rehabilitation - Wold Bank&#13;
management has agreed to an exceptionally high share of the IDA Credit being eligible&#13;
for retroactive financing, i.e. up to 35 percent of IDA Credit. Under this provision, the&#13;
Government will be able to be reimbursed for urgent expenses which it has incurred since&#13;
May 31 st, 2000.&#13;
100.  Special Account. The Program will have three Special Accounts, one managed&#13;
by ECDF to allow continuation of its activities; one managed by the Bank of Eritrea for&#13;
the Private Sector Reconstruction component; and one managed by the PMU for all other&#13;
components, as well as overall coordination. These Special Accounts would be operated&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
V.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
101.  Monitoring of the progress in implementing the ERP will be carried out through a&#13;
computerized MIS established in the PMU. The MIS will provide the baseline&#13;
information for quarterly and annual financial and activity reports.&#13;
102.  Since the ERP is such a large and critical investment, evaluating its impact on the&#13;
beneficiaries will also be a priority. This process will have two stages:&#13;
*  The first stage will be to produce baseline data on welfare of the population. A&#13;
baseline household survey is planned to be conducted before services are delivered to&#13;
communities, as well as a follow-up survey of the same households a year after&#13;
service delivery. A rapid review of the data is expected to inform the operation of the&#13;
project, and a deeper analysis of the data will guide policy makers The first survey&#13;
will be a core welfare monitoring survey of the Core Welfare Indicators&#13;
Questionnaire (CWIQ) type. This ideally should be done immediately after project&#13;
effectiveness. However, the second survey should be of the Priority or Household&#13;
Budget type, with repeat visits to the households.&#13;
* The second stage involves regular project monitoring as well as beneficiary&#13;
assessments.&#13;
103.  The implementation of the Surveys will be coordinated by the University of&#13;
Asmara, which has already developed sufficient capacity to carry out this type of activity.&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The evaluation of ERP impact will be done through beneficiary impact assessments&#13;
carried out by external institutions. Coordination of the whole M/E component will be&#13;
done through the ERP Steering Committee, which will share the results with&#13;
representatives of Government institutions and donor agencies.&#13;
VI. Donor Coordination&#13;
104. The establishment of successful mechanisms to coordinate inputs and&#13;
contributions being provided by different development partners will be key to the success&#13;
of the ERP. Donor coordination for this Program will be achieved through two main&#13;
provisions. First, to facilitate the achievement of this objectives, the government stressed&#13;
the importance of adopting harmonized procedures in terms of procurement, financial&#13;
management requirements, and reporting requirements. A meeting with all concerned&#13;
development partners was held during the appraisal mission to discuss these issues, and a&#13;
manual with harmonized procurement procedures has been produced with inputs&#13;
provided from donor agencies representatives. Second, donor coordination will be&#13;
sustained throughout the Program by a strategy of joint supervision missions.&#13;
VII. Environmental Aspects&#13;
105.  The program is classified as environmental category B because no component is&#13;
expected to have a significant environmental impact. No major new construction is&#13;
envisaged besides reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-damaged roads, bridges,&#13;
buildings, small-scale irrigation systems, power transmission lines and community&#13;
infrastructure. An Environmental Analysis of the whole Program will be carried out and&#13;
completed no later than six months after the date of effectiveness. Terms of Reference for&#13;
the Analysis have been agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;

I. SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM&#13;
The Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP) will include procurement under the&#13;
following components:&#13;
(A) Agriculture&#13;
Purchase and distribution of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, tractors and machinery and&#13;
livestock. The agricultural inputs will be given to war and drought-affected people to enable them&#13;
to resume agricultural and livestock production.&#13;
(B) Infrastructure Rehabilitation:&#13;
*  Roads sector: (i) reconstruction of roads and bridges damaged during the conflict, such as the&#13;
Tesseney Gash, Dassie-Agwaro and Kuluku bridges, and 255 linear meters of bailey bridge&#13;
sections; (ii) rehabilitation, upgrading and reshaping of links to provide improved access to&#13;
settlements and camps of displaced people; (iii) construction of bridges and culverts , and&#13;
reshaping of road sections to improve access to communities affected by drought and famine;&#13;
and (iv) pre-construction studies, design work and construction supervision.&#13;
-  Energy sector: rehabilitation of the Massawa power plant destroyed during the recent war;&#13;
replacement of power generators in Barentu and Tesseney; repairs to the electrical power&#13;
systems in Adi-Quala and Senafe.&#13;
(C) Private Sector Development: Assistance to Eritrean Banks whose portfolio has been&#13;
affected by the destruction of assets financed by loans and in the form of (i) debt relief; (ii) loan&#13;
fund; and (iii) TA.&#13;
(D) Social Protection: Assistance to households through: replenishing the ECDF to support basic&#13;
rehabilitation of social infrastructure at community level and micro-credit scheme; housing&#13;
programs through provision of materials for rebuilding houses; and safety net program.&#13;
(E) Balance of payment support: financing the purchase of equipment and commodities on a&#13;
positive list of imports needed for reconstruction and rehabilitation.&#13;
In addition, monitoring and evaluation and program management may require TA and&#13;
purchase of basic equipment.&#13;
II. ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PMU&#13;
The Program will be coordinated by a small Program Management Unit (PMU) housed in&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. The team includes three experienced professionals (the Program Manager,&#13;
a procurement adviser and a financial officer) who will coordinate with line ministries and other&#13;
government agencies. Additional people may be added depending on the magnitude of the work.&#13;
Under the guidance of the Program Manager, the team will manage and coordinate the procurement&#13;
and financial management activities under the ERP. The actual implementation of the individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
components of the Program will be the responsibilities of the relevant line Ministries or&#13;
government agencies such as: the Ministry of Agriculture (agricultural items and commodities); the&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Mines (power sector), the Ministry of Public Works (roads and other civil&#13;
works), the Ministry of Local Government (ECDF housing and safety nets, Ministry of Finance&#13;
(BOP support), and Bank of Eritrea (private sector development). Experienced Trading firms may&#13;
be used as procurement agents for bulk import of the commodities needed for the Program.&#13;
III. PROCUREMENT SCHEDULING AND PROCESSING&#13;
The line ministries (LM) will make use of the already established implementation units&#13;
under present Bank/PPs financed projects. In addition to implementation, they will be fully&#13;
responsible for the technical quality, contractual management and accountability of their purchases&#13;
and contracts. The LM units will include at least one experienced procurement officer and will&#13;
carry out the following preliminary actions at the inception of the Program:&#13;
(i) action plan for their procurement activities for the full ERP 24-month period;&#13;
(ii) complete list of items and procurement activities, and their cumulative cost;&#13;
(iii) packaging of items and services by region/timing/method of procurement;&#13;
(iv) list of high priority items or activities and critical path procurement schedule;&#13;
(v) list of training and consulting needs, their schedule and status;&#13;
(vi) monthly report on activities (goods, works, services, consulting); and&#13;
(vii) drafting of specification, TORs and advertising (where required) of contracts.&#13;
Coordination meetings between the management / procurement officers of each line&#13;
ministries implementation units and PMU will be held at the PMU office monthly. Procurement&#13;
and finance officers may carry out additional meetings for technical coordination, training and&#13;
scheduling of activities. The PMU manager will make sure that each of the line ministries involved&#13;
in the Program will attend the meetings, be kept fully informed and will report on their activities.&#13;
At least 3 copies of this Manual will be distributed to each of the line ministries and agencies&#13;
responsible for the implementation of ERP.&#13;
IV. PROCUREMENT PACKAGING AND METHODS&#13;
Procurement under ERP will take into account the situation of emergency in the country and&#13;
the needs for prompt, in some cases immediate, action in the re-establishment of vital services such&#13;
as water supply and sanitation and the need to supply relief to a very high number of displaced and&#13;
deported persons. The procurement methods and relative monetary thresholds selected have been&#13;
chosen as the most economic and efficient under the circumstances. In addition, in order to comply&#13;
with the principles of transparency, efficiency and competition, both Procurement Program and&#13;
procurement methods were subject to prior review and approved by the Bank and Participating&#13;
Partners. Procurement methods and schedules, timing of intervention and delivery were planned&#13;
and discussed with the Bank Lead Procurement specialist and task managers of each sector during&#13;
several coordination meetings. Different options have been offered for the procurement of vital&#13;
supplies based on the availability of goods and suppliers, speed of delivery, maximized competition&#13;
and local situation. The immediate emergency includes a first stage of about nine months from the&#13;
cessation of hostilities, for which fast track procurement methods will be used. Transparency of the&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
process will be assured at all times both by the proven record of the implementing agencies and by&#13;
the insertion of strategic procurement and financial controls at (i) regional and central line&#13;
ministries level, and (ii) PMU level and Bank/PPs levels. Audit of the procurement actions will be&#13;
carried out at regular intervals by both internal and external auditors in addition to Bank/PPs&#13;
procurement and disbursement audits.&#13;
1. PROCUREMENT OF GOODS&#13;
Goods to be procured under the ERP include commodities such as seeds, fertilizers and&#13;
livestock; equipment such as agricultural tools, machinery, office equipment and electrical spare&#13;
parts; transport and work vehicles such as tractors and motorcycles; plant such as power generators&#13;
and bailey bridges, and construction materials. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be&#13;
published at program inception by each of the implementing agencies (or cumulatively by the&#13;
PMU) to indicate business opportunities under ERP and give international suppliers the&#13;
opportunity to indicate their interest to bid under the Program.&#13;
International Purchases&#13;
1.1 Modified International Competitive Bidding (MCB)&#13;
Given the need for immediate availability of goods and unsuitable packaging, ICB with&#13;
modified advertising and currency provisions will be used only for packages whose delivery can be&#13;
scheduled towards the second part of the Program. Once the contracts to be procured will be&#13;
identified, ICB procedures will follow section 2.64 of the IDA's Guidelines on Procurement under&#13;
IRBD loans and IDA credits, January 1995 edition, revised January 1999. In particular, specific&#13;
procurement notices shall be inserted in at least one national newspaper of wide circulation, in&#13;
addition to a newspaper, periodical or technical journal of wide multinational circulation. The&#13;
period allowed for the submission of bids will be reduced to 4 weeks only. Bidding and payment&#13;
may be limited to one currency widely used in international trade such as the USD or the EURO.&#13;
1.2  Limited International Bidding (LIB)&#13;
LIB will be used in alternative to other methods such as modified ICB, international&#13;
shopping and commodities market, for large packages of goods obtainable only from abroad and&#13;
whose delivery is expected in the first part of the Program. The line agencies will seek bids from a&#13;
list of potential suppliers, such as bidders from previous ICB, and broad enough to assure&#13;
competitive prices. Domestic preference will NOT be applied in the evaluation of bids. Modified&#13;
bid documents and specifications used under previous Bank financed projects may be used. LIB&#13;
will not be subject to any monetary threshold under ERP. The aggregate value for LIB and ICB&#13;
combined is expected to be about US$20 million equivalent.&#13;
1.3  International Shopping (IS)&#13;
International shopping (IS) will be used for purchases from abroad, as an alternative to LIB&#13;
and IAPSO for contracts with an individual value of less than US$600,000 equivalent and an&#13;
aggregate value of US$10 million. The IS method is based on comparing price quotations obtained&#13;
from at least three suppliers based in two different countries. Requests for quotations will indicate&#13;
the description and quantity of goods or standard specification commodities in addition to the&#13;
desired delivery time and place. Quotations may be submitted by telex, electronic mail or facsimile.&#13;
The evaluation of quotations will follow national procedures reviewed and found acceptable by the&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bank. Any other factor other than price (e.g. delivery) to be used in the evaluation, will be stated in&#13;
the request for quotations and given a relative weight in the evaluation provisions. The terms of the&#13;
accepted offer will be incorporated in the purchase order.&#13;
1.4  Direct Contracting (International)&#13;
Direct contracting (sole source) at competitive, negotiated price below or comparable to&#13;
market price, may be used in the following cases:&#13;
(a) in response to emergency situations, when immediate action is required. This may&#13;
include purchases of commodities, food, shelter etc. for displaced people and deportees;&#13;
(b) to purchase additional goods from an existing contract. Whenever possible, provisions&#13;
for extensions will be included in the original contract;&#13;
(c) for standardization purposes in order to purchase equipment, spare parts and proprietary&#13;
products compatible with existing equipment; and&#13;
(d) in exceptional cases, subject to IDA/PPs previous no objection.&#13;
1.5  Procurement from United Nations Agencies&#13;
Procurement of items such as food, water, vehicles, agricultural inputs may be purchased&#13;
from specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN), such as IAPSO, acting as suppliers pursuant&#13;
to their own procedures. Under certain circumstances, lUN agencies may be used as procurement&#13;
agents to speed up handling and delivery of specialized products No monetary threshold is&#13;
required under ERP for purchase from UN agencies.&#13;
1.6  Commodities market (International and National)&#13;
Large quantities (more than US$I million individual contract) of commodities such as seeds,&#13;
grain, animal feed, livestock etc. may be purchased in alternative to LIB through conventional&#13;
commercial practices for commodities. Bidders, taken from a list of established suppliers, may be&#13;
invited to quote prices linked to the market price at the time of or prior to the shipment. Offers can&#13;
be made by telexed or faxed bids with no bid security. In general, standard contract conditions and&#13;
forms consistent with market practices for commodities will be used. An example of commercial&#13;
practices used by an Eritrean trading agency is shown in Attachment 1.&#13;
National Purchases&#13;
1.7 National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
Procedures and contracts normally used for public procurement by Eritrea will be used. NCB&#13;
may be carried out through (i) local advertisement or; (ii) through the use of short-listed, registered&#13;
suppliers under several categories. All other requirements will follow procedures similar to those&#13;
described in section 3.3 of Chapter III of IDA's procurement guidelines and no side letter will be&#13;
necessary. Standard bid documents, already approved under other Bank financed projects such as&#13;
ECDF, will be used. It is expected that under ERP, NCB will be used only for packages for which&#13;
no urgent delivery (more than-30 days) will be required.&#13;
1.8 National Shopping (NS)&#13;
National shopping (NS) will be one of the most common procurement methods used during the&#13;
emergency period. It will be used, in alternative to NCB, when readily available goods and&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
standard specifications commodities are available from more than one source in the country, at&#13;
competitive prices. Price quotations will be requested from several suppliers, usually at least three,&#13;
to assure competitive prices. Requests for quotations will indicate the description and quantities of&#13;
the goods, as well as desired delivery time and place. Any other factor other than price, e.g.&#13;
delivery to be used in the evaluation, will be stated in the request for quotations and given a relative&#13;
weight in the evaluation. Quotations may be submitted in writing, e.g., by telex, electronic mail or&#13;
facsimile. The terms of the accepted offer will be incorporated in the purchase order. National&#13;
shopping (NS) will be limited to contracts below the monetary threshold of US$600,000 for an&#13;
aggregate value of US$10 million.&#13;
1.9  Direct Contracting (sole source)&#13;
The method is similar to the one described in section 1.4, above, though it will be used in&#13;
relation to national purchases and existing national contracts.&#13;
1.10 Market / Auction Purchase&#13;
This basic procurement method will follow commercial practices and will be used, in&#13;
alternative to direct purchasing and NS, for the purchase of small numbers of animals (oxen,&#13;
camels) and other goods, available only in places of public markets in Eritrea and (if necessary)&#13;
abroad. Price will be based on the prevailing demand and offer on the day of the purchase. No&#13;
threshold has been established for this method though contracts are likely to be less than&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
2. PROCUREMENT OF WORKS&#13;
In order to re-establish vital services such as utilities, communications, shelters, and vital&#13;
supplies in the refugees areas, reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads, culverts, bridges and&#13;
power plant will be necessary. Contractors and force account units may be required to employ IDPs&#13;
and labor force (as far as practicable). The following procurement methods will be used:&#13;
2.1  International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
No ICB for works is expected under the ERP, given the lack of suitable packages. Business&#13;
opportunities for foreign contractors will be advertised as a GPN in Development Business&#13;
however. Interested foreign contractors replying to the advertisement will be taken into&#13;
consideration for higher cost and complex contracts under other procurement methods, such as LIB&#13;
and NCB. Modified ICB procedures would be used in case of packages beyond the monetary&#13;
threshold of US$5 million.&#13;
2.2 National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
Procedures will follow the Ministry of Public Works guidelines and national ranking of&#13;
contractors. Bids would be requested from national bidders either by (i) advertising in national&#13;
newspapers; or (ii) listing of pre-qualified contractors based on the Ministry of Public Works&#13;
rankings and guidelines. In case of complex or large contracts, (larger than US$2 million&#13;
equivalent, but below US$5 million), only international contractors both from abroad or based in&#13;
Eritrea, and national contractors ranked under category 1 of MOPW guidelines, will be invited to&#13;
participate. Procurement procedures (see annex 4) would follow national procedures consistent&#13;
with those described in section 3.3 of Chapter III of IDA' s procurement guidelines. Prior review of&#13;
the Bank will be required for works beyond the threshold of US$3 million equivalent.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.3  Price Quotations (QP)&#13;
The method will be used, in alternative to NCB, for most of the urgent construction or&#13;
rehabilitation works. Registered / qualified bidders who are not fully committed with other work&#13;
will be requested to submit quotations. In most cases, at least three or more bidders should be&#13;
invited to bid. Quotations will be submitted in writing, i.e. by fax, letter, or electronic mail (copies&#13;
to be kept for the records). No bid or performance securities will be required. In urgent cases, such&#13;
as for restoration of vital services, quotations may also be requested in (i) the form of "unit rate&#13;
prices" (if work quantities are available with a reasonable degree of reliability); (ii) "cost-plus fee"&#13;
arrangements (when quantities cannot be reasonably determined in advance); or (iii) in the form of&#13;
a "lump sum" based on cost estimates carried out by PMU and its implementing agencies, or, if not&#13;
possible, by the contractors. The lowest priced offer will be selected. Prior review of the Bank will&#13;
be required for works beyond the threshold of US$1 million equivalent.&#13;
2.4   Direct Contracting (DC)&#13;
Direct contracting (sole source) will be used only when no other competitive procurement&#13;
methods can be used or no advantage can be obtained by further competition such as in the case of&#13;
emergency works and extension of previous works and services. Bank prior review will be required&#13;
in all cases unless an immediate decision is required due to an emergency.&#13;
2.5  Force account (FA)&#13;
Force account, that is, use of Government's own personnel and equipment may be used in&#13;
the following cases: (i) only the force account units have the required expertise to carry out the&#13;
particular works or services; (ii) quantities of works involved cannot be defined in advance; (iii)&#13;
works are small and scattered or in remote or risky locations for which qualified contractors are&#13;
unlikely to bid at a reasonable price; (iv) there is a high risk of work interruptions; and (v) there are&#13;
particular emergencies requiring prompt attention. The use of the force account and its procedures&#13;
of execution must first be agreed with IDA/PPs. Under ERP, financing may be based on a ratio of&#13;
80% of its estimated contractual cost.&#13;
2.6   Community Participation (CP)&#13;
In order to achieve some of the social objectives of the Program, local communities and/or&#13;
non governmental organizations (NGOs) may be called to carry out specific activities such as small&#13;
scale rehabilitation and reconstruction works and/or labor intensive activities in coordination or&#13;
assisted by local contractors or Government forces.&#13;
3. CONSULTANT SERVICES&#13;
Most of the consulting assignments under ERP are expected to be short term and to be&#13;
carried out by national consultants. Foreign consultants will be recruited for TA and more complex&#13;
assignments where no adequate local skills exist. National procedures will be used for the&#13;
procurement of both individual and consultant firms. The procedures were reviewed by the Bank&#13;
and found consistent with the procedures described in IDA Consultants Guidelines, January 1997&#13;
edition, revised January 1999. They can be summarized under the following selection methods:&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.1   Quality and Cost-based selection (QCBS)&#13;
This is a competitive selection process which takes into account the quality of the proposal&#13;
submitted by each consulting firm versus the cost of the services. Under the emergency component,&#13;
it will be used in a modified form using shortlists of national and international consultants for&#13;
contracts above the threshold of US$300,000. Advertising for specific contract on Development&#13;
Business is not envisaged under the Emergency. Requests of interest will be forwarded only to&#13;
experienced firms (3 to 6 in number) proposed by the implementing agencies and their advisers.&#13;
Evaluation procedures will be consistent with sections 2.19-2.22 of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Only the financial offers of the bidders which were evaluated to be technically sound will be&#13;
considered.&#13;
3.2    Qualification (CQ)&#13;
Selection by Qualifications will be the preferred selection method used under the Emergency&#13;
Program below the threshold of US$300,000 equivalent. The line ministries and PMU, when&#13;
needed, will prepare the TORs; request expression of interest and information on the consultants'&#13;
experience and competence relevant to the assignment; establish a shortlist, and select the firm with&#13;
the most appropriate qualifications and experience. The selected firm will be asked to submit a&#13;
combined technical / financial proposal and then be invited to negotiate the contract. Both national&#13;
or international firms may be selected with this method under the ERP.&#13;
3.3  Fixed Budget (FB)&#13;
The fixed budget method will be used in alternative to the QCBS and CQ methods when&#13;
budget is fixed and scope of the assignment can be well defined. The selection procedures will be&#13;
similar to those described in section 3.5 of IDA's Consultants Guidelines. No advertising will be&#13;
necessary for most contracts under the emergency component. Short-listed firms (3 to 6) will be&#13;
invited to make an offer. Both national and international firms may be invited to participate.&#13;
The Request for Proposal will indicate the available budget and request the consultants to provide&#13;
their best offers in separate envelopes WITHIN the budget. Proposals that exceed the budget will&#13;
be rejected.&#13;
3.4  Force account for services&#13;
"Services" such as use of government drivers for transport, rehabilitation works, emergency&#13;
works and farm use in substitution of workers presently deported or displaced, may be procured&#13;
under modalities designed by the implementing agencies and to be approved by IDA/PPs. Accurate&#13;
records of working hours and payments will be kept by the implementing agencies / PMU for post&#13;
review and auditing purposes. The financing of these activities will be based on a ratio of 80% of&#13;
the estimated contractual cost.&#13;
3.5  Selection of individual consultants&#13;
Individual consultants, both national and international, will be selected on the basis of their&#13;
qualifications for the assignment. They may be selected on the basis of "references" or through&#13;
"comparison of qualifications" among those approached by the implementing agencies and, when&#13;
needed by the PMU. Individual consultants will have to meet all relevant qualifications and be&#13;
fully capable of carrying out the assignment. Capability will be judged on the basis of academic&#13;
background, experience in the works and services in whi-;h he/she is to be appointed and adequate&#13;
knowledge of the local conditions.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. REVIEW BY IDA/PPS OF PROCUREMENT DECISIONS&#13;
5.1  Prior Review&#13;
In order to reduce delays, prior review will be limited to ICB and to large contracts above the&#13;
monetary thresholds stated in the Manual. IDA/PPs may request prior review of bid documents,&#13;
evaluation methods and contracts for which they require more detailed information. Similarly, any&#13;
request for no objection from PMU will be formally replied by IDA/PPs:&#13;
At Appraisal / Negotiations&#13;
* Procurement Action Plan and Scheduling (*)&#13;
* List of items to be procured (works and goods) and major packaging (*)&#13;
* Procurement methods and monetary thresholds by Component (*)&#13;
* TA, training and consulting needs and scheduling (*)&#13;
At Inception of the Program (Effectiveness)&#13;
*  General Procurement Notice for goods, works and consulting services under ERP&#13;
* Manual of procurement procedures under ERP (*)&#13;
* LACI based procurement assessment (*)&#13;
During Implementation&#13;
*  All procurement under ICB, as for IDA Guidelines Appendix I&#13;
*  Goods and works contracts above threshold of US$3 million equivalent&#13;
*  Force Account design and procedures&#13;
*  Consulting / training contracts above US$ 100,000 (individual) and US$300,000 (firms)&#13;
*  All TORs of consulting assignments (unless standard and pre-approved by IDA/PPs)&#13;
*  Whenever IDA/PPs Task Managers make request for prior review&#13;
* Action already carried out.&#13;
5.2  Post-Review&#13;
Under ERP, the procurement actions not subject to mandatory prior review as described in&#13;
5.1 above, will be subject to post-review. This is to allow fast disbursement of funds while assuring&#13;
transparency and consistency with the "Manual of procurement procedures". All documentation&#13;
used for contracting, recruitment of consulting services, evaluation and award shall be retained by&#13;
the implementing agencies / PMU for subsequent examination by independent auditors and&#13;
IDA/PP supervision missions. Number, timing and pattern of supervision missions will be&#13;
determined at the start of the implementation program.&#13;

Component B/2 (Power)&#13;
The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MOE), Eritrea electric authority, operates two systems of&#13;
supply whose source of generation is all thermal, namely:&#13;
(a) the Inter-Connected System (ICS) which supplies Asmara, Massawa, the towns in between,&#13;
Keren, Mendefera and Dekemhare through 132 and 66KV transmission lines, and&#13;
(b) the Self-Contained System (SCS) which consists of five (5) isolated supply centers having their&#13;
own generation and distribution facilities.&#13;
Air raids caused substantial damages to both ICS and SCS systems and in particular to the newly&#13;
built (and still under commissioning) Hirgigo Power Plant in Massawa and related sub-stations&#13;
which formed the back-bone of the system.&#13;
Damages to the ICS system included those to:&#13;
(i) 132/66/15KV substation switchgear&#13;
(ii) local control rooms for diesel generators units No. 3 and 4;&#13;
(iii) cladding of the power house, south side&#13;
(iv) stacks for engines No. 1 and 2, and&#13;
(v) minor damage to mechanical and electrical equipment and storage area&#13;
The estimate of cost (subject to revision) for the ICS system is as follows:&#13;
Civil works ................ 3,000,000 USD&#13;
Mechanical ................ 5,600,000 USD&#13;
Electrical ................  6,400,000 USD&#13;
Generator 4 (provisional) ..3,000,000 USD&#13;
Substation ................  1,600,000 USD&#13;
Damages to the SCS system, include those to the Barentu and Tesseney power generators, and to&#13;
the generation and distribution facilities of Adi Quala, Adi Keih and Senafe. Estimates are:&#13;
Barentu .................100,000 USD&#13;
Tesseney ................  300,000 USD&#13;
Adi Quala ................  30,000 USD&#13;
Adi Keih ................   25,000 USD&#13;
A contingency of 10% should be added.&#13;
Procurement will make use of fast-track construction and purchasing methods which will allow for&#13;
an early re-establishment of the two systems, as follows:&#13;
*  The rehabilitation of both Massawa Hirgigo power station and related sub-stations damaged&#13;
during the war will be carried out by Direct Contracting using the contractors was just&#13;
completed the construction of the structures and are still on site.&#13;
* Replacement of power generators and other electrical and mechanical equipment of Barentu /&#13;
Tesseney and other generating centers will be carried out through L.I.B or international&#13;
shopping based on cost and a list of available suppliers.&#13;
*  Repairs to the electrical power system will be carried out either by Quotations or Force&#13;
Account depending on the area, extent of damage and availability of local contractors.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Financial relief to the affected enterprises will be under the form of loans with or without waiver of&#13;
interest.&#13;
(b) Loan Fund&#13;
A loan fund will be channeled through the three banks above to finance the fixed investments and&#13;
permanent working capital needs of viable private enterprises, especially to finance foreign&#13;
currency needs, e.g. for the imports of machinery.&#13;
(c) Technical Assistance Program&#13;

banks following established (private sector) Commercial practices, acceptable to the Bank/PPs and&#13;
in accordance to section 3.12 of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
Recruitment of international consultants (firms and individuals) for the sub-component (c) will&#13;
make use of shortlists and the QCBS method for contracts above US$300,000, and Qualifications&#13;
method for assignments below that threshold. No advertising will be required for most&#13;
assignments.&#13;
Recruitment of national consultants (individuals and firms) will follow nationalpractices and&#13;
Qualifications for all contracts below US$300,000 equivalent. QCBS will be used for consulting&#13;
contracts higher than US$300,000 equivalent.&#13;

(b) Replenishment of ECDF - Micro-credit Component (US$2 million)&#13;
The ECDF "village bank savings and credit program" will be re-financed under each of its two tiers&#13;
to provide small loans to groups and individuals and finance small business in rural areas&#13;
Established private sector and Commercial practices acceptable to the Bank/PP, and already used&#13;
under ECDF project, will be used for this sub-component.&#13;
(c) Housing Component (US$10 million)&#13;
This sub-component will provide resources and/or materials to subsidize the cost of re-building&#13;
houses, destroyed during the war, for approximately 20,000 poor households. The activities will be&#13;
supervised by the Ministry of Local Government. Procurement will be based on Community&#13;
Participation and Quotations methods, with occasional direct contracting for works, and shopping&#13;
Idirect contracting for the purchase of construction materials and tools.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Procedures for National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
under ERP&#13;
Procedures under NCB and other competitive bidding will follow national procedures consistent&#13;
with Bank/PPs guidelines. They will include clauses which will allow for a more competitive&#13;
participation by national contractors, such as&#13;
* Contractors registration: MOPW guidelines will be followed. National contractors category 2-&#13;
10 will be allowed to participate only for works within their own capability.&#13;

US$ or ECU), based on their needs and expressed in percentage of the overall bid price.&#13;
* Rate of exchange: will be fixed and based on the date specified in the bid documents.&#13;
* Currency of payment: payments will be made in the same currencies of bids at a fixed rate of&#13;
exchange&#13;
* Bid opening: will be open to public and will be held immediately after bid closing hour.&#13;
* Escalation formula: all contracts beyond 9 months will include a price variation formula.&#13;
* In lack of reliable price indexes, cost increases will be based on invoices and Client records.&#13;
* Advance payment: generally up to 15% of the contract value, may be as high as 30% under&#13;
emergency situation to be determined by the Client. Advance may be given in foreign currency&#13;
based on currency of bid.&#13;
Advance Guarantees&#13;
* Advances up to 5% of the contract value will require no bank or insurance guarantee.&#13;
* Advances up to 30% of the contract will require either (i) a bank guarantee; (ii) an insurance&#13;
bond acceptable to Client; or (iii) a written declaration by a supplier, e.g., (cement, aggregates,&#13;
plant, equipment). Client will pay directly to suppliers.&#13;

EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
(PROJECT ID #P044674)&#13;
EXTRACTS FROM THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REVIEW&#13;
Asmara&#13;
September 2000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.   PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
The overall objectives of the proposed program are: (i) to assist Eritrea rapidly to rebuild key&#13;
physical and social infrastructure (bridges, health clinics, schools, etc.); (ii) to help displaced and&#13;
drought-affected people rebuild their lives and resume their economic activities, through the&#13;
provision of urgently needed inputs such as tools, seeds, shelter items, as well as employment&#13;
opportunities; (iii) to rehabilitate the privates sector through the provision of lines of credit; and&#13;
(iv) to assist the government to maintain macroeconomic stability through balance of payments&#13;
support.&#13;
2. PROGRAM SCHEDULE&#13;
The Program is expected to be implemented over a twenty-four-month period, starting in&#13;
December 2000.&#13;
3. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
The Program is divided into five main components:&#13;
3.1 Agriculture&#13;
This component will finance the purchase and distribution of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools,&#13;
tractors and machinery, and livestock. Agricultural inputs, including livestock will be given as a&#13;
one-time grant to an estimated 770,000 war and drought-affected households, the majority of&#13;
whom are farmers, to enable them resume agricultural and livestock production. Tractors and&#13;
heavy machinery will be needed to revive productive capacities so as to compensate for the&#13;
reduced availability of agricultural labor, and animal draft power, as well as to expand&#13;
agricultural activities in new areas which have not been affected by the war. These tractors and&#13;
machinery will remain for the moment property of the GOE, which is however planning to&#13;
privatize this after the immediate needs related to the war emergency have been met.&#13;
3.2 Infrastructure Rehabilitation&#13;
This component will finance the reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure in the roads&#13;
and energy sector.&#13;
3.2.1 Roads Sector&#13;
This sub-component will provide emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of key roads and&#13;
bridges, to secure timely delivery of food and social services to the war affected population,&#13;
facilitate the resettlement and return of war refuges, and help economic recovery by reducing&#13;
road transport costs. The Program will finance: (i) Reconstruction of roads and bridges damaged&#13;
during the conflict; (ii) Rehabilitation, upgrading and reshaping of links around the central belt;&#13;
(iii) construction of a bridge and culverts, and reshaping of road sections in the northern and&#13;
northeastern areas of the country; (iv) Procurement of culverts, gabions and some 255 linear&#13;
meters of Bailey bridge sections; and (v) Pre-construction studies and design work, and&#13;
construction supervision.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.2.2 Energy Sector&#13;
The sub-component will finance: (i) the rehabilitation of the Massawa Hirgigo power plant which&#13;
forms the back-bone of the Eritrean power system and was damaged during the recent conflict;&#13;
The replacement of power generators in two towns in western Eritrea; (ii) repairs to electrical&#13;
power systems.&#13;
3.3  Private Sector Reconstruction&#13;
This component will consist of three parts:&#13;
3.3.1 Support to Affected Enterprises&#13;
This sub-component will enable the three commercial banks in Eritrea (the Commercial Bank of&#13;
Eritrea [CBE]; the Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea [HCBE]; and the Eritrea&#13;
Development and Investment Bank [EDIB]) to provide debt relief to an estimated 3,000&#13;
borrowers who were affected by the recent war. As a result of the destruction of assets financed&#13;
by their loans, these banks' portfolios have suffered an estimated loss of US$34 million. The&#13;
extent of financial relief to the affected enterprises will be based on estimated damage to the&#13;
assets.&#13;
3.3.2 Loan Fund&#13;
Funds will be channeled through the same three commercial banks to finance the fixed&#13;
investment and permanent working capital needs, on commercial terms, of viable private&#13;
enterprises, especially to finance foreign exchange needs. The Fund will have no sectoral&#13;
limitations to the type of sub-projects eligible for financing. The loan maturity will be expected to&#13;
be four to five years.&#13;
3.3.3 TechnicalAssistance Program&#13;
The successful implementation of the Loan fund would depend on the ability of the three banks to&#13;
allocate credit to enterprises based on a critical assessment of long term credit risk, and the ability&#13;
of the Bank of Eritrea to exercise its prudential control over the banking institutions it is supposed&#13;
to regulate. The essential elements of the Technical Assistance Program will include provision of&#13;
experts in the banking sector and supporting training activities.&#13;
3.4  Social Protection&#13;
This component will assist vulnerable households by financing activities aimed at preventing&#13;
further deterioration in the welfare of those affected by war and drought, and at strengthening&#13;
their capacity to better manage social and economic risks. Specific activities include:&#13;
3.4.1 ECDF Infrastructure&#13;
Funds amounting to US$21 million will be replenished to the Eritrean Community Development&#13;
fund (ECDF). The ECDF finances community-based subprojects including rehabilitation and&#13;
development of basic social and economic infrastructure. The new funds will be used to&#13;
rehabilitate affected social infrastructure (schools, health facilities, access roads, and water supply&#13;
systems) in those areas which have been affected by the recent fighting.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.4.2 ECDFMicro-Credit&#13;
The Micro-Credit sub-component will be refinanced (US$2 million) to allow it to provide loans&#13;
of up to US$1,000 to groups or individuals for income generating activities. The Program will&#13;
also provide loans of up to US$10,000 to groups or individuals who progress to Tier Two of the&#13;
financing arrangements as per the Operational Manual.&#13;
3.4.3 Housing Program (no IDAfinancing)&#13;
This sub-component will provide resources and/or materials to subsidize the cost of rebuilding&#13;
houses of 20,000 households who lost their houses and all their belongings during the recent&#13;
fighting. An ERP Desk, housed within the Ministry of Local Government, will be responsible for&#13;
developing prototypes of housing facilities which will fit the culture, environment and well-being&#13;
of the beneficiaries, and for overseeing the overall project implementation. Regional and sub-&#13;
regional offices will be responsible for identifying specific housing rehabilitation needs,&#13;
mobilizing and training communities, monitoring, and supervising the works.&#13;
3.4.4 Community-based Safety Nets Program (no IDAfinancing)&#13;
This sub-component will include the financing of traditional safety nets to be implemented at the&#13;
community level. The Regional offices of the Ministry of Local Government will be responsible&#13;
to define eligibility criteria, planning and oversee implementation. In most cases, it is expected&#13;
that appropriate beneficiaries will receive cash grants, to be repaid without interest in two yearly&#13;
installments. Other methods (e.g. cash-for-work) will be considered whenever appropriate. A&#13;
project specific survey will be carried out shortly to determine exact needs, spread and extent of&#13;
households affected by the conflict.&#13;
3..5 Balance of Payments support (no IDA financing)&#13;
This component will provide the Government with immediate quick-disbursement balance of&#13;
payments support to be spent towards a positive list of imports.&#13;
4.   FINANCING AND COST SHARING&#13;
The overall size of the Program is estimated to be US$287.7 million of which IDA is expected to&#13;
finance US$90 million, the Government will contribute US$24 million equivalent. Multilateral&#13;
and bilateral development partners are expected to finance US$173.7 million towards the&#13;
Program through parallel or co-financing.&#13;
5. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS / PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.1  Institutional and Management arrangements&#13;
The Program will be coordinated by a small Program Management Unit (PMU) housed in the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The PMU will be responsible for: (i) ensuring that inputs are delivered on&#13;
time to the various implementing agencies noted below; (ii) collecting information about&#13;
implementation progress and making it available to concerned partners; (iii) managing all&#13;
international procurement, and the Special Account (excluding the separate Special Account for&#13;
the replenishment of ECDF, which will be managed directly by the Fund); and (iv) fulfilling all&#13;
auditing, accounting, financial management and reporting requirements.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The actual implementation of the individual components will be the responsibility of the relevant&#13;
line ministries or government agencies, in particular: Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Energy;&#13;
Ministry of Public Works; Ministry of Local Government; Ministry of Finance, and the Bank of&#13;
Eritrea. A number of the implementing agencies are already implementing on-going Bank-&#13;
financed projects and staff in these agencies are conversant with the World Bank's procurement&#13;
and disbursement procedures.&#13;
A Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the Director General, Ministry of Local&#13;
Government, and consisting of Director Generals of all implementing sector ministries will&#13;
oversee implementation of the Program and take policy decisions on issues related to&#13;
implementation effectiveness.&#13;
5.2 Procurement of Goods, Works and Services&#13;
The main regulations governing the operations of the Program are outlined in the Manual of&#13;
procurement procedures under ERP, which has been drafted by the borrower in coordination with&#13;
the Bank. The manual will be adopted by co-financing partners in order to harmonize&#13;
procurement arrangements and ensure the fastest and most efficient way to respond to the&#13;
emergency situation. The methods outlined in the Manual are based on government regulations,&#13;
commercial practices, and simplified ICB, LIB and international shopping for the procurement of&#13;
goods manufactured abroad.&#13;
The Finance Officer and members of the PMU and the implementing agencies are conversant&#13;
with the procurement procedures.&#13;
5.3 Flow of Funds&#13;
Regarding IDA and the State of Eritrea funding, ERP should maintain 3 bank accounts&#13;
(Additional bank accounts, if deemed appropriate, will be opened as and when other&#13;
development partners join ERP and, once the bases for participation by those partners have&#13;
been fully determined): (i) Special Account with the Bank of Eritrea in US Dollars; (ii) an&#13;
account in local currency with a commercial bank (Part I Account) to which drawdowns from the&#13;
Special Account should be credited for Program financing and administrative expenses; and (iii)&#13;
an account in local currency with a commercial bank (Part 2 Account) to which counterpart&#13;
funding by the Government should be deposited in respect of any expenditure of ERP that may&#13;
be provided for in the Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
Flow of funds to the implementing agencies will be determined by the procurement arrangements&#13;
for the various activities to be carried out under the relevant components. As far as possible, the&#13;
PMU will manage intemational procurement, using the funds in the Special Account, by&#13;
requesting the Bank to make direct payments to suppliers, and by letters of credit through special&#13;
commitments issued by the Bank.&#13;
ECDF and Bank of Eritrea will manage their own separate Special Accounts.&#13;
5.4 Financial Management and Reporting&#13;
The financial transactions relating to this operation will be recorded and monitored by&#13;
computerized financial management system of the PMU and those of the implementing agencies.&#13;
The PMU, having considered the recommendations of the Finance Officer, should determine:&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* ERP's Chart of Accounts as well as the format and content of Quarterly Reports and Annual&#13;
Financial Statements;&#13;
* the selection and adoption of accounting policies and accounting standards; and&#13;
* the need to include any supplementary notes to the Project Financial Statements in order to&#13;
enhance the presentation of a "true andfair view ".&#13;
Subject to a decision being made by PMU, these reports include financial statements (e.g. sources&#13;
and application of funds; expenditure classified by project components, disbursement categories,&#13;
expenditure types and implementing agencies, and comparison with budgets; short-term forecasts&#13;
of expenditure; unit costs for key items and comparison with budgets; etc.). The reports should&#13;
closely follow sample formats that are given in the World Bank's Loan Administration Change&#13;
Initiative (LACI) Handbook.&#13;
5.5 External Audit&#13;
Extemal audits of the accounts of the program will be done annually. In due course, ERP - in&#13;
consultation with the World Bank and other donors - will appoint independent auditors in&#13;
compliance with the financial covenants that are expected to be contained in the IDA Credit&#13;
Agreement. Terms of reference for the external auditor are expected to be modeled on Annex&#13;
XIX, Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAHI) of the World Bank,&#13;
which contains "Sample Terms of Reference for the Audit of Project Financial Statements.&#13;
6.   RISKS&#13;
6.1. Country Risks.&#13;
The main country risk is in respect of the resumption of the conflict which is primarily&#13;
responsible for this emergency program. This could lead to destruction of newly rebuilt and&#13;
refurbished infrastructure, housing and businesses, and further lead to displacement of people.&#13;
This risk is mitigated by the acceptance by both parties (Ethiopia and Eritrea) of internationally&#13;
mediated peace agreement and the deployment of United Nations observers, and subsequently a&#13;
full peacekeeping force.&#13;
6.2. Project Risks.&#13;
* Institutional Arrangements /Program Implementation&#13;
The use of a management unit with qualified and experienced professionals to coordinate the&#13;
accounting and auditing arrangements ensures that this is a low risk. Implementing agencies are&#13;
already familiar with Bank procedures.&#13;
* Program Structure and Costing&#13;
Each component will be carried out by a separate implementing agency responsible to carry out&#13;
the respective activities under that component. The risk is therefore low.&#13;
* Internal Control Structure&#13;
The risk is low as the program will use already existing structures.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*  Accounting Standards, Finahcial and Management Reporting&#13;
The risk is medium, until the PMU responds to the requirements for regular financial and&#13;
management reporting. The use of professionally qualified and experienced personnel in the&#13;
PMU should mitigate this risk.&#13;
* Special Accounts, Disbursements and Supporting Documentation&#13;
This is a medium risk until PMU becomes familiar with Bank disbursement and procurement&#13;
arrangements, and also effectively coordinates the supporting documentation from the various&#13;
implementing agencies. Expertise is already available in the implementing agencies which have&#13;
separate ongoing Bank-financed projects.&#13;
* Staffing and Training&#13;
This risk is medium until staff key staff are demobilized to man key positions in the relevant&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
* Auditing Arrangements&#13;
Risk is low since the implementing agencies are already familiar with external audit&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
* Budgeting and Monitoring&#13;
Risk is low, as competent implementing agencies will prepare budgets and monitor the Program&#13;
activities.&#13;
Based on the above, the Program is rated LOW.&#13;
7.  THE WAY FORWARD&#13;
The financial management requirements for progressing this project further can be split into two:&#13;
(i) the immediate minimum requirements to comply with the Bank's OP/BP 10.02, and (ii) those&#13;
relating to eligibility for PMR-based disbursements.&#13;
7&#13;

At this stage, the financial management systems in place are not adequate to provide reasonable,&#13;
accurate, and timely information as required by the Bank for PMR-based disbursements&#13;
Given that this is an Emergency Program with a very short implementation period of 24&#13;
months; the fact that there will be harmonization of reporting requirements to accommodate&#13;
the various development partners; and the Program's  characteristics and risks into&#13;
consideration, approval has been sought from the Bank's Loan Department to dispense with&#13;
the requirement for the project to attain the minimum requirements  for PMR-based&#13;
disbursements for the program. This means that the traditional disbursement procedures would&#13;
be followed throughout the implementation period of the Program. However, the project&#13;
implementing agencies should still be required to prepare simplified PMR (financial reports)&#13;
to track expenditures.&#13;
9    CONCLUSION&#13;
Subject to the Required Actions and Next steps presented above being adequately&#13;
addressed by PMU prior to Effectiveness, the World Bank's minimum financial&#13;
management requirements will be satisfied. This also includes the timely establishment of&#13;
the Program Management Unit, and the appointment of a Finance Officer.&#13;

Environmental Analysis&#13;
Eritrea Emergency Reconstruction Project&#13;
Background&#13;
Origin of the Emergency&#13;
Eritrea has suffered extensive damage from two sources: a border war with Ethiopia and&#13;
a prolonged drought. Until May 2000, the war with Ethiopia was contained to a relatively&#13;
limited area in Eritrea, with some 270,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the&#13;
border areas. Following the fighting in May 2000, there was a sudden and massive&#13;
increase in the internally displaced population, including evacuation from two large&#13;
regions in Eritrea (Gash Barka and Debub), which contribute some 70 percent of Eritrea's&#13;
total grain production. According to the Government's estimates, internally displaced&#13;
people number 1.1 million, including those displaced earlier. The sudden movement of&#13;
such large numbers of people in a total population of roughly 3.5 million, has put host&#13;
communities under considerable strain and it is estimated that about 170,000 people in&#13;
host communities have been affected. The war has also had a substantial adverse impact&#13;
on the agricultural sector - loss of food and seed stocks, loss of farm tools, damage to the&#13;
ploughed land, loss of livestock, and so on. Since the rainy season in Eritrea starts&#13;
towards the end of June, the outlook for agricultural production in the coming year is&#13;
very dismal, not just in the war areas, but throughout the country.&#13;
Several joint Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC)/UN/NGO rapid&#13;
assessment missions have suggested that, since the end of May, most of the displaced&#13;
people have been living without shelter and sanitation and many have sought safety in&#13;
remote areas, making access by the relief agencies extremely difficult.&#13;
Eritrea is also suffering from drought. Along with several other parts of the Horn of&#13;
Africa, the Sahel area of Eritrea (predominantly pastoral areas) has been particularly&#13;
affected by the failure of short rains two years in a row. Out-migration to more food-&#13;
secure and urban areas has begun. Some 316,000 people are estimated to have been&#13;
affected. Although widespread famine and disease outbreaks have not yet occurred,&#13;
partly owing to Government efforts to mitigate the adverse impact by providing food and&#13;
other assistance, there is a growing concern that the situation will deteriorate in the&#13;
coming months and early warning signals, such as rising morbidity rates and falling&#13;
livestock prices, are already evident.&#13;
Response of the Government and the International Community&#13;
The government and the people of Eritrea have immediately started reacting to the&#13;
humanitarian crisis on two fronts: (i) by providing emergency relief and assistance to the&#13;
IDPs and the hosting communities; and (ii) by organizing the available human and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial resources in order to start the process of reconstructing and rehabilitating the&#13;
areas damaged by the recent invasion. The main actor for the first set of activities is the&#13;
Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC), which since the time of the&#13;
liberation struggle has provided essential food, shelter, and medical care for people in&#13;
need. It also coordinates all NGO activities in the country, ensuring that all people in&#13;
need receive critical goods and services.&#13;
ERREC has so far succeeded in providing most people with sufficient food, medicine,&#13;
shelter and other basic goods and services to prevent major loss of life or disease. It has&#13;
been able to do this by importing food and essential supplies using scarce foreign&#13;
exchange. An appeal to seek international support for emergency and relief needs has&#13;
been prepared by ERREC in collaboration with the UN system and launched during the&#13;
month of May, 2000.&#13;
The second set of activities are more directly connected with the proposed Emergency&#13;
Recovery Program. They require the involvement of all govermnent agencies, and an&#13;
even more significant contribution from the international community. The process of&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation of such large areas of the country will be tackled in two&#13;
phases: (i) a first set of immediate needs will be met through the financing of the ERP;&#13;
the activities financed will enable the country to restart some productive activities and&#13;
repair the infrastructure necessary to allow this process; (ii) the remaining and less urgent&#13;
needs will be addressed through individual sector programs prepared and financed in&#13;
collaboration with the development community.&#13;
The Government asked for the Bank's assistance in preparing the Emergency&#13;
Reconstruction Program (ERP) and presenting it to the international community for&#13;
financial support.&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Program&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The overall objective of the proposed program is to assist Eritrea rapidly to rebuild its&#13;
physical and social infrastructure, help displaced and drought-affected people rebuild&#13;
their lives and resume their economic activities, and assist the government to maintain&#13;
macroeconomic stability through balance of payments support. The program is comprised&#13;
of five components: (a) agriculture, (b) infrastructure reconstruction and rehabilitation,&#13;
(c) private sector development, (d) social protection, and (e) balance of payments&#13;
support.&#13;
The overall cost of the program is estimated to be US$287.7 million, of which IDA will&#13;
finance US$90 million, and the government will contribute US$24 million equivalent. It&#13;
is expected that multilateral and bilateral development partners will finance US$173.7&#13;
million, through parallel or co-financing, so that there would be no financial gap in the&#13;
Program.&#13;
Likely Environmental Impacts&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The program is not expected to have a significant environmental impact, but, because of&#13;
several issues related to the social protection, and private sector development&#13;
components, an Environmental Analysis of likely environmental impacts is to be carried&#13;
out. This is consistent with the program's rating as a Category B project.&#13;
The primary issues of concern relate to the impact of housing and settlement on the local&#13;
environment in the social protection component, and how potential environmental&#13;
impacts from the private sector component will be identified and mitigated.&#13;
The Private Sector Development component will provide assistance to Eritrean banks&#13;
whose portfolios have been affected by the destruction of assets financed by loans,&#13;
tentatively estimated at US$34 million. This assistance will take the form of: (i) debt&#13;
relief to approximately 3,000 war-affected enterprises (ii) a Loan Fund, to provide&#13;
investment and working capital to firms, especially to finance foreign exchange needs&#13;
(iii) technical assistance to the Banking sector.&#13;
The Social Protection component will include (i) refinancing of the existing Eritrean&#13;
Community Development Fund, which finances community-driven sub-projects for the&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of basic social infrastructure, as well as a micro-credit&#13;
scheme (ii) financing a housing program, which is expected to provide materials to&#13;
subsidize the cost of rebuilding houses of poor families (iii) a Community-Based Social&#13;
Safety Nets Program.&#13;
Environmental Analysis, Terms of Reference&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The objective of completing the Environmental Analysis of the Emergency Recovery&#13;
Project is to examine the project's potential negative and positive enviromnental impacts&#13;
and recommend any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for&#13;
adverse impacts and to improve environmental performance. The Environmental&#13;
Analysis will give particular attention to the impact of the housing program on the&#13;
environment, and measures to ensure that sub-projects financed through the private sector&#13;
component are assessed for their possible environmental impacts and that these are&#13;
prevented or mitigated.&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
The Environmental Analysis will be completed in a manner which fully reviews the two&#13;
areas of concern identified during project preparation.&#13;
Impact of Housing Program&#13;
The Environmental Analysis will review proposals to be financed by the project with&#13;
respect to the construction of new housing, with a view to assessing likely negative&#13;
environmental impacts on tree cover associated with, but not limited to,&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* the impact of increased settlement densities on woodfuel use in project areas;&#13;
* the impact of new construction on forest cover;&#13;
* plans for mitigating these impacts through, for example, the use of alternative fuels&#13;
and cooking strategies; and low-wood using building technologies.&#13;
The Analysis will review the state of knowledge with regard to low-cost building&#13;
technologies in Eritrea, and will assess the trade-offs between providing subsidized&#13;
building supplies, or cash grants for construction.&#13;
Private Sector Development&#13;
The Private Sector Development component has been designed to finance a range of sub-&#13;
projects, and as such, has the characteristics of a Financial Intermediary type of project.&#13;
Before approving a subproject, the Fl verifies (through its own staff, outside experts, or&#13;
existing environmental institutions) that the subproject meets the environmental&#13;
requirements of appropriate national and local authorities and is consistent with OP 4.01&#13;
and other applicable environmental policies of the Bank. Procedures for carrying out sub-&#13;
project specific environmental screening and assessment were developed during&#13;
preparation of an earlier operation, and it is expected that these procedures, which rely on&#13;
carrying out environmental analyses for subprojects, will be followed.&#13;
The Environmental Analysis will review these procedures with regard to the adequacy of&#13;
Eritrea's environmental requirements relevant to the component and the proposed EA&#13;
arrangements for subprojects, including the mechanisms and responsibilities for&#13;
environmental screening and review of EA results. The Analysis should include an&#13;
assessment of the institutional mechanisms (including, as necessary, identification of&#13;
measures to strengthen capacity) for the subproject EA work. The Analysis should&#13;
include a plan for ensuring that subprojects are adequately reviewed.&#13;
Reports and Time Schedule&#13;
The Environmental Analysis should be completed in draft within 4 months of credit&#13;
effectiveness. Its recommendations should be consistent with overall Government policy&#13;
and project implementation modalities, and should comply with the environmental&#13;
review requirements in Eritrea's National Environmental Procedures and Guidelines;&#13;
and (to the extent possible for an Emergency Operation) with World Bank's Operational&#13;
Policy 4.01 Environmental Assessment.&#13;
The Environmental Analysis should be made available in Eritrea at some public place&#13;
accessible to potentially affected groups and local NGOs and must be submitted to the&#13;
Bank. Once the separate report is released locally and officially received by the Bank, it&#13;
is sent to the World Bank Infoshop through which interested parties may obtain it. It&#13;
should be made available in the Infoshop no later than 6 months after credit effectiveness.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Reconstruction Project
            will assist Eritrea in the process of long-term
            reconstruction, and economic recovery, through the
            implementation of five sub-components: agriculture,
            infrastructure rehabilitation; private sector
            reconstruction, social protection, and, balance of payments.
            The main expected benefit is to mitigate the consequences of
            the ongoing humanitarian crisis, by providing assistance to
            displaced people, through agricultural inputs, grants for
            reconstruction of destroyed housing, and micro-finance. In
            addition, the project will lay the basis for long term
            recovery, by rehabilitating key infrastructure, initiate
            economic growth, and restore macroeconomic stability.
            Nonetheless, the risk of resumption of hostilities with
            Ethiopia still exist. Retroactive financing has been
            approved for the project, for expenditures made after June
            1st, 2000, and, full disbursement is expected by December 2002.
