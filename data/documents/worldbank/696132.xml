1. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT AND REFORM&#13;
A. HIGHWAY STRATEGY AND POLICY&#13;
1.1   At the central level, the basic strategy is to develop a National Trunk Highway&#13;
System (NTHS). The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is in charge of planning the&#13;
NTHS, consisting of 12 interprovincial trunk expressways, with a total length of some&#13;
35,000 km and connecting 95 major Chinese cities. While immediate priority is being&#13;
given to two north-south and two east-west corridors ("two verticals and two&#13;
horizontals") and three other major transport corridors (Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-&#13;
Shenyang, Chengdu-Beihai), the Beijing-Zhuhai (Jingzhu) Expressway, which is one of&#13;
the "two verticals," constitutes the highest priority corridor in this program. This&#13;
expressway crosses the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong over a&#13;
distance of approximately 2,500 km and will connect, once completed, Beijing with&#13;
Guangdong's fast-growing Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong. It is designed as a high-&#13;
grade, high-performance facility, at a minimum four-lane standard, fully access-&#13;
controlled, and will be operated throughout as a toll highway. Jingzhu is scheduled for&#13;
substantial completion by the year 2000. At the provincial/regional level, the strategy is&#13;
to concentrate on network maintenance and the expansion and improvement of provincial&#13;
and rural road networks currently totaling more than 1 million km, to provide greater&#13;
mobility and to stimulate socioeconomic development, particularly in less developed&#13;
areas.&#13;
1.2  In terms of highway and road transport policy, growing attention is being paid to&#13;
removing administrative barriers to interprovincial trade and to redefining the Central&#13;
Government's role in transport, in light of rapid administrative decentralization and&#13;
growing private sector involvement in highway development and road transport services.&#13;
Provincial and municipal governments are expected to continue mobilizing most&#13;
investment resources required, including access to private investment and capital markets,&#13;
and to seek greater expenditure efficiency through improved highway planning and&#13;
investment strategies, as well as to modernize maintenance management and improve&#13;
cost recovery from road users. Local governments are also expected to further the&#13;
development of road transport services and the road construction industry through&#13;
deregulation and promotion of competition, access to modern technology and improved&#13;
management. The Bank has prepared a report (No. 11819-CHA dated February 1994),&#13;
CHINA: Highway Development and Management-Issues, Options and Strategies, which&#13;
serves as the basis for the Bank Group sector assistance strategy.&#13;
B. LINKAGE TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.3  In highways, the key problem facing China is its comparative neglect of the sector&#13;
over several decades. Accordingly, China's road network ranks among the sparsest in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
world relative to geographic area or population and is quite unsafe. The Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China, presented to the Board on June 1, 1995, and the&#13;
Progress Report on March 26, 1996, support China's needs to rapidly modernize and&#13;
expand its highway system. To achieve this, the Government of China (GOC), with Bank&#13;
and other multi- and bilateral assistance, is giving high priority to developing the system&#13;
of expressways leading to the NTHS. Among other priority corridors, the Bank is already&#13;
heavily involved in the construction of substantial sections of Jingzhu expressway,&#13;
between Beijing and Guangzhou. Under the ongoing National Highway (NHl) Project,&#13;
two important sections are presently being built in Hebei and Henan. Under the proposed&#13;
Second National Highway (NH2) Project, two priority sections in Guangdong and Hunan&#13;
would be undertaken. Under a future Third National Highway (NH3) Project, which is&#13;
under preparation, several important expressway sections as well as a major Wuhan&#13;
Yangtze River bridge under an agreed Build-Operate-Transfer (B-O-T) arrangement&#13;
would be undertaken in Hubei Province. A newly proposed Fourth National Highway IV&#13;
(NH4) Project would cover two important expressway sections in Hunan and Hubei,&#13;
which will be linked to the Yangtze bridge B-O-T scheme. These four National Highway&#13;
Projects constitute a well thought-out and well-balanced series of investment operations&#13;
that assist GOC and the concerned provinces in the timely completion of China's highest&#13;
priority expressway corridor. In general, the Bank's program of support in the highway&#13;
sector will continue to assist China in the foreseeable future in the financing,&#13;
development and management of its priority expressway system.&#13;
C. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.4   The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Government in the transport&#13;
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.6 billion for 33 projects. The dialogue&#13;
between the Government and the Bank Group on transport sector strategy and policies&#13;
has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways and&#13;
ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed studies&#13;
as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The most&#13;
recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector, besides Highway Development and&#13;
Management: Issues, Options and Strategies also include China 's Railway Strategy (No.&#13;
10592-CHA) issued in February 1993, and Strategies for Road Freight Development (No.&#13;
12600-CHA) issued in January 1995. In addition, studies on the trucking industry and on&#13;
highway finance have been completed. Studies on the road construction industry,&#13;
interprovincial traffic facilitation, highway capacity, intercity passenger transport, and&#13;
improved prioritization of highway investments and highway feasibility methodology are&#13;
presently being undertaken. On the basis of its strong project and sector work, the Bank is&#13;
deepening its involvement and assisting the Government in the design and implementation&#13;
of institutional and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation and investment&#13;
planning; policy, legal, and regulatory framework for private transport provision; sector&#13;
financing; deregulation of transport services, and transfer of advanced technology through&#13;
training and equipment. Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a&#13;
transport sector strategy paper to help guide sector development in a consistent and&#13;
cohesive framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. LESSONS FROM PREvIous BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.5   Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early&#13;
preparation for major civil and traffic engineering works and for procurement processes,&#13;
where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of bidding&#13;
documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth&#13;
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.&#13;
The design of traffic-engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications,&#13;
tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be finished shortly after&#13;
completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.&#13;
1.6   Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people has also led to&#13;
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects. A large&#13;
number of people are typically affected by resettlement in China, particularly along&#13;
important economic corridors where highways are being upgraded and constructed. The&#13;
institutional requirements for resettlement of these numbers of people are significant.&#13;
Under the proposed NH2 project, resettlement has received considerable attention to&#13;
ensure institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans.&#13;
1.7   Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.&#13;
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during&#13;
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during&#13;
both the construction and operation phases.&#13;
1.8   Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of&#13;
roads. Poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle-operating cost&#13;
savings. Higher costs also result from premature deterioration, where corrective actions&#13;
in the form of increased maintenance and/or rehabilitation are required. Effective&#13;
remedial actions include stringent contractor prequalification, careful formulation of&#13;
supervision arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts, training of local&#13;
supervision staff and equipping the supervision teams.&#13;
1.9   Project design must put more emphasis on highway management and operation,&#13;
especially in the context of toll expressways. There is also a growing concern that&#13;
adequate funding for highway maintenance is not now being generated to cover an&#13;
expanding and more expensive highway system. Previously, this was not an issue since&#13;
adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose.&#13;
1.10  Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway&#13;
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank&#13;
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Institutional components&#13;
that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact, as&#13;
compared with free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.&#13;

2. THE EVOLVING FRAMEWORK FOR PRIVATE TOLL&#13;
HIGHWAY FINANCE&#13;
A. CURRENT STATUS OF PRIVATE PROJECT FINANCE&#13;
2.1   In response to an estimated $600 billion capital requirement for infrastructure&#13;
from 1995 to 2004, China is moving steadily to open certain sectors, mainly highway&#13;
development and power generation, to foreign equity investors and debt financing. Some&#13;
$300 billion, or half the country's near-term infrastructure needs, are in the transport&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.2   To date, China has used $2 billion in foreign capital to construct 7,000 km of&#13;
highways and expects to do more in the future. Through the year 2000, in fact, China&#13;
expects to construct a total of 14,160 km of new limited access highways, of which nearly&#13;
2,500 km will be fully access-controlled urban or intercity expressways. The size of this&#13;
program, in terms of distance and cost, well exceeds any similar toll road program now&#13;
underway in the world, outstripping by far the country's public revenues and access to bi-&#13;
and multilateral bank funds.&#13;
2.3   The alternative for China is to raise the needed capital in the external credit&#13;
markets, with the commercial involvement of qualified private firms and international&#13;
investors, and minimal government guarantees. The participation of private firms in&#13;
B-O-T highway projects has been explored, and the issuance of project company&#13;
securities has been tried in offshore capital markets to fund the construction of quasi-&#13;
public projects.&#13;
2.4   By accessing new equity investment and debt capital in global markets, China is&#13;
seeking to accomplish at least three near-term objectives:&#13;
(a)   Reduce Sovereign Debt Exposure to Infrastructure. Private capital,&#13;
including user charges and project debt from domestic and international&#13;
sources, can supplement limited public resources available to the central&#13;
government and provinces. This can minimize the need for using the&#13;
government's credit capacity to fund infrastructure projects;&#13;
(b)   Improvement in Efficiency and Productivity. Private financing assists&#13;
the country in improving management efficiency and quality of&#13;
infrastructure services because of the for-profit, commercial orientation of&#13;
private investors and lenders; and&#13;
(c)   Offloading Construction and Commercial Risks. If properly structured,&#13;
privately financed projects, unlike publicly funded infrastructure, allow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
government to pass on the completion and commercial risks to those best&#13;
able to handle them, the private sponsors.&#13;
2.5    China, like most developing countries, continues efforts to build a workable&#13;
structure for attracting private capital to infrastructure projects.  The process of&#13;
accommodating the needs of private investors while finding a cost-effective way to&#13;
develop expressways is not an overnight task in China, but a process of trial and error.&#13;
The country's experience with privately supported highway projects is evolving and the&#13;
transition from traditional public funding to project financing will occur as the result of&#13;
specific projects, with lessons learned, and a regulatory framework built largely on&#13;
experience.&#13;
2.6   Nearly all of the projects involving foreign investors have been structured as Sino-&#13;
foreign joint ventures rather than concessions that are owned outright by the sponsors. In&#13;
this way, the Chinese agencies retain a degree of control as equity partners. Foreign&#13;
sponsors look to their local counterparts to obtain governmental approvals and assurances&#13;
at various levels.&#13;
2.7    Concession arrangements to construct and operate a highway under a B-O-T&#13;
scheme have been constrained by the absence of a well-developed legal framework and&#13;
limitations in the joint venture agreement. The public authorities whose decisions&#13;
influence the financial aspects of the project (State Council, State Planning Commission,&#13;
State Administration for Exchange Control) are generally not contractual parties to the&#13;
joint venture agreement. Separate assurances and acknowledgments that have been&#13;
sought from these entities are often difficult to secure.&#13;
2.8   The result is that foreign commercial banks and financial markets are reluctant to&#13;
accept project risk in China, making limited-recourse financing extremely difficult for&#13;
project sponsors to mobilize. This situation applies to all infrastructure sectors, and the&#13;
highway sector is no exception. In cases where external-debt financing of project&#13;
companies has occurred, lenders have relied on guarantees and assurances of creditworthy&#13;
governmental agencies, banks, and financial institutions, such as provincial international&#13;
trust and investment corporations (ITICs).&#13;
2.9   As in new toll highway projects worldwide, private investors in China are&#13;
concerned over revenue loss from a shortfall in traffic volume and/or the inability to&#13;
secure adjustments in the tariff structure on a timely basis. To mitigate such risks and to&#13;
attract foreign investment, minimum revenue guarantees by local partners/governmental&#13;
agencies and preferential profit distribution for foreign investors are common in Sino-&#13;
foreign joint venture highway projects. To enhance toll revenues, foreign investors have&#13;
received land development concessions along the right-of-way and at interchanges and/or&#13;
revenues from operating highways.&#13;
2.10 There have been a few major highway projects accomplished in China with&#13;
private capital in recent years. The following two are particularly notable:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(a)   Shenzhen-Guangzhou Superhighway (123 km). This facility opened in&#13;
1994 and is the first phase of the Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Zhuhai&#13;
Superhighway.  The $1.2 billion project is sponsored by Hopewell&#13;
Holdings of Hong Kong, responsible also for design, construction and&#13;
financing. The developer has also taken extensive risks including land&#13;
acquisition in return for profit-sharing and rights for commercial&#13;
development at interchanges. One third of the original project cost was&#13;
funded by equity and shareholder loans provided by the foreign sponsor&#13;
and subordinated domestic loans arranged by a Guangdong provincial&#13;
joint-venture partner. The remaining $800 million was financed with&#13;
syndicated foreign bank loans, chiefly supported by a cash-flow deficiency&#13;
guarantee by the Guangdong ITIC.&#13;
(b)   Chengdu-Mianyang Expressway (90 km). This toll road was financed&#13;
as a joint venture between a Sichuan provincial partner and the New China&#13;
Hong Kong Group, which has a number of China-affiliated shareholders.&#13;
The provincial partner was responsible for land acquisition and&#13;
construction of the expressway for a fixed fee. The foreign sponsor&#13;
handled private placement of approximately $100 million equity shares&#13;
with offshore investors including private infrastructure funds to finance&#13;
such construction. Minimum toll revenue guarantees and preferential&#13;
profit distribution were offered to attract foreign equity investors to&#13;
Sichuan Province, and obligations of the local partner were guaranteed by&#13;
the provincial ITIC.&#13;
2.11  The foregoing examples illustrate innovative and pragmatic ways to raise capital,&#13;
but the question to be asked is how should China proceed to develop a workable project&#13;
fmance model for highway development. Whether through startup toll road projects or&#13;
securitized financing of existing, high-volume roadways, the answer will depend largely&#13;
on the appetite investors and lenders have for project risk and China's willingness to&#13;
address financing constraints, both in an institutional sense and in the context of its&#13;
regulatory system.&#13;
B. ISSUES IN PROJECT FINANCE IN CHINA&#13;
2.12  In response to China's substantial demand for infrastructure capital, the results of&#13;
the country's efforts to attract private funds have lagged behind reasonable expectations.&#13;
China's success in attracting foreign direct investment to manufacturing, real estate, and&#13;
service industries, now at a level of $30 billion annually, has not translated to&#13;
infrastructure. Despite a high level of interest among foreign developers and investors,&#13;
unacceptable project risks have limited the number of deals that were closed. Likewise,&#13;
the country's solid record as a sovereign borrower of long-term funds in the international&#13;
bond markets is not yet reflected in the critical, but unaccomplished, goal of bringing&#13;
long-term debt financing to its infrastructure sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
2.13  In B-O-T projects, a project sponsor is generally responsible for design,&#13;
construction, financing and operation for a specified concession period, at the end of&#13;
which ownership of the project is transferred to the host country. When the projects are&#13;
properly structured, long-term lenders, rather than equity investors, provide the bulk of&#13;
the financing on a limited-recourse basis to the sponsors. Since export credits are&#13;
relatively limited in civil-work-intensive highway projects, the mobilization of long-term&#13;
commercial debt at favorable rates is essential to a successful financing package.&#13;
2.14  For commercial banks, limited recourse project finance is different from&#13;
conventional sovereign or corporate lending, in that project revenues and rights under&#13;
various project agreements are security for repayment, rather than the borrower's&#13;
diversified assets and ability to repay. The return to these lenders is limited compared&#13;
with equity investors since there is no possibility of an up-side gain from earnings. These&#13;
institutions are more risk-averse in their credit decisions and to date have demonstrated&#13;
considerable reluctance to support China's B-O-T projects with limited-recourse funds.&#13;
2.15  Project developers and lenders require a stable policy and regulatory environment&#13;
to assess and properly manage project risks. A commitment is needed by the host&#13;
government to manage country or political risks, namely related to policy and regulations&#13;
and the performance of public agencies. Most B-O-T projects allocate commercial and&#13;
political risks among the parties to the transaction. For the public sector, such risk&#13;
sharing mechanisms in the concession agreement enable the government to transfer these&#13;
substantial commercial risks during project construction and operation to the private&#13;
developer and lenders.&#13;
2.16 The common difficulties in B-O-T projects in China, as perceived by foreign&#13;
investors and lenders, are related to various policy, legal, regulatory and institutional&#13;
issues that affect the investment climate. The principal concerns are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Regulatory Uncertainty.  Unclear lines of authority between the&#13;
provinces and central government, a complex approval process, and&#13;
ambiguous criteria and policies, lead to lengthy and costly project delays.&#13;
(b)   Convertibility and Availability of Hard Currency.  Investors and&#13;
lenders share concern over the absence of legal convertibility of the&#13;
renminbi, timely availability of hard currency through swap centers, and&#13;
impact on payment of foreign denominated debt and repatriation of profit.&#13;
(c)   Unclear Toll Policy.   Automatic tariff adjustment provisions in&#13;
concessions are not available, leaving project sponsors and lenders with no&#13;
assurance that operating and financial costs can be recovered on a current&#13;
basis, or over the life of the concession.&#13;
(d)   Inadequate Legal Framework. China's legal system has not developed&#13;
enough to accommodate complex B-O-T transactions, raising concerns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
among lenders on security-related financial and legal issues, including the&#13;
enforceability of contracts and agreements.&#13;
(e)   Creditworthiness  of Public Entities.   Uncertain  or insufficient&#13;
creditworthiness of provincial/municipal contracting parties and concern&#13;
for their ability of honoring financial obligations under contracts.&#13;
(f)    Lack of Transaction Experience. Most provincial/municipal authorities&#13;
have no direct experience with project finance or B-O-T transactions,&#13;
causing foreign companies to commit expensive resources to time-&#13;
consuming negotiation and on-the-job training of public sector&#13;
counterparts.&#13;
2.17  In those project financings that have reached closure in China, public and private&#13;
parties to the transaction have settled their concerns through negotiation and risk-sharing&#13;
arrangements. This informal arrangement may be sufficient in many coastal provinces,&#13;
where foreign banks and developers are more experienced and have reached a reasonable&#13;
level of comfort with the credit of local agencies.&#13;
2.18  Even in the developed provinces, however, most foreign institutions do assess a&#13;
risk premium over the uncertainty of China's policies and regulations, and this can inflate&#13;
the cost and pricing of projects. In the country's interior, provincial credit concerns and&#13;
lack of a track record with the private sector are major obstacles in closing project finance&#13;
transactions with international firms and lenders.&#13;
2.19  The ordinary concerns of project finance lenders are generally multiplied by toll&#13;
road projects, which have complex and generic demand-related risks. In this case, a&#13;
transport service is sold to the discretionary user, whereas power purchase agreements,&#13;
for example, tend to provide power projects with a clear, defined source of income. The&#13;
primary risks in China's toll road projects are:&#13;
(a)   Uncertain traffic volume, especially in the inner provinces where future&#13;
traffic growth will depend heavily on economic development and&#13;
associated government policies;&#13;
(b)   Absence of arterial road systems and networks to support toll highways;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   Competition from parallel free roads and other modes of transport that are&#13;
developed in the future.&#13;
2.20 As in virtually all countries, a limited number of highway projects in China will&#13;
have the traffic and revenue potential to attract private capital, and the process by which&#13;
these are identified and packaged will be the most important factor in their success. Since&#13;
toll revenues alone in China may not be adequate to support most privately financed&#13;
highway projects, other mechanisms may also be necessary. These may include cross-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
subsidies from existing toll roads and other sources, such as a fuel tax and/or land&#13;
development incentives and tax concessions.&#13;
C. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT&#13;
2.21  China's State Planning Commission (SPC) is formulating a provisional regulatory&#13;
framework for foreign-owned pilot B-O-T projects in various infrastructure sectors,&#13;
including highways up to 80 km long, major bridges and tunnels, power stations, and&#13;
urban sewage and water supply. SPC intends to promulgate the Provisional Decree for&#13;
Concession Projects with Foreign Investment governing these projects and is now&#13;
drafting model procurement documents for toll road and power projects. Private sponsors&#13;
of pilot B-O-T projects are to be selected through competitive bidding. A power project&#13;
(Guangxi Laibin B Power Plant Project) has already been selected as the first pilot B-O-T&#13;
project, with procurement that was launched in December 1995.&#13;
2.22  The Bank supports GOC's efforts to establish a regulatory framework for&#13;
privately financed infrastructure and has encouraged the development of a transparent&#13;
procurement procedure where sponsors would be selected through competitive bidding.&#13;
Through Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant funds&#13;
available to SPC, the Bank is supporting the initial feasibility analysis of a pilot B-O-T&#13;
project, known as the Junshan Yangtze River Bridge, and the preparation of model&#13;
procurement documents and a concession agreement for this and future toll highway&#13;
projects.&#13;
2.23 Under the proposed National Highway III (Hubei) Project, which would be a&#13;
Bank-financed highway operation, the Borrower and the Bank have agreed to develop the&#13;
Yangtze River Bridge under a B-O-T arrangement with the central government and Hubei&#13;
Province. At a project cost of $200 million, the six-lane bridge would be located at the&#13;
intersection of two National Trunk Highways, the Beijing-Zhuhai North-South&#13;
Expressway and the Shanghai-Chengdu East-West Expressway. The latter projects will&#13;
be partially be financed by the Bank and operated as publicly owned toll roads.&#13;
2.24  The implementing agency for the National Highway III Project is the Hubei&#13;
Provincial Communications Department, which has applied for designation of the&#13;
Yangtze River Bridge as a pilot B-O-T project. As the approving agency, SPC has&#13;
expressed interest in this project as an opportunity, with the new policy framework, to&#13;
test the international market for private investment in highway infrastructure.&#13;
2.25  Several pilot B-O-T projects will enable China to experiment with new policy&#13;
initiatives to attract private capital and to gain valuable experience from the results. It is&#13;
important at this stage for the public sector to remain flexible with the provisional decree&#13;
and concession documents. Adjustments may be necessary to fulfill the requirements of&#13;
investors and lenders in order to make the first few projects bankable. Successful closure&#13;
of these projects will provide China with a track record and base of experience, thereby&#13;
contributing to future B-O-T projects that can be financed in the external financial&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.26  In the longer term, China's success in capturing offshore capital for highway&#13;
infrastructure will require continued development of the regulatory framework and&#13;
investment environment in several specific areas:&#13;
(a)   Transparent Policy and Regulatory Framework. SPC's initial decree&#13;
governing foreign-owned B-O-T projects should be expanded as a policy&#13;
instrument, given the fact that most of China's experience with toll road/&#13;
bridge/tunnel projects is limited to joint ventures.&#13;
(b)   Development of Legal System. The regulatory framework for privately&#13;
financed infrastructure should be fully integrated with relevant national&#13;
and provincial laws, so as to address various aspects (design, ownership,&#13;
financing, construction, operation, maintenance, taxation) of B-O-T-type&#13;
infrastructure projects.&#13;
(c)   Institutional Development of Agencies. Functions and relationships of&#13;
central and provincial authorities should be clearly defined, along with the&#13;
legal status, authority, and financial condition of prospective sponsors of&#13;
private projects.   For example, national and provincial highway&#13;
corporations could be developed as commercial toll road operators with&#13;
the capacity to raise capital in the international markets.&#13;
(d)   Growth of Domestic Capital Markets. For China to meet its near-term&#13;
capital requirements for infrastructure, the country must have access to a&#13;
supply of long-term debt capital. China's financial markets, which benefit&#13;
from a high per capita savings rate, lack the structure and financial&#13;
instruments to convert domestic savings to requirements for long-term&#13;
funding of infrastructure.&#13;
D. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP&#13;
2.27  The Bank will continue to assist China in developing the policy and regulatory&#13;
framework needed to mobilize private financing for infrastructure. Movement in this&#13;
direction will enable the borrower to leverage limited Bank funds with public and private&#13;
resources to undertake a greater number of projects and to attract long-term debt capital&#13;
from the financial markets.&#13;
2.28  World Bank support for China will include institutional development and sectoral&#13;
reforms as well as the development of the NTHS and other priority investments through&#13;
direct loans to public projects. Through a series of National Highway II, III, and IV&#13;
Projects, the Bank will play an expanded role in encouraging the growth of private&#13;
finance in this sector.&#13;
2.29 Technical Assistance. SPC, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOC have&#13;
given the Bank a mandate to support them in the establishment of the framework for&#13;
private highway finance in China. The Bank's assistance through PHRD funds under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
National Highway II, III, and IV Projects is the major first step in this effort. At China's&#13;
request, the Bank has also indicated that it is willing to permit the use of IDA technical&#13;
assistance to fund legal and financial advisory fees for pilot B-O-T infrastructure projects&#13;
that reach the negotiation stage.&#13;
2.30  Partial Guarantee. The Bank's partial guarantees would enable private projects&#13;
to obtain longer-term limited-recourse debt financing at lower cost than the sponsors or&#13;
sovereign might obtain. These require a counterguarantee by the host government and so&#13;
far China has rejected financial guarantees for privately financed infrastructure. Limited&#13;
guarantees for selected policy-related risks, such as contractual compliance or&#13;
performance risks of public agencies, may be required to make projects, especially those&#13;
in the interior provinces, commercially financeable.&#13;
2.31  IFC and FIAS. IFC and the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) are&#13;
assisting China in the development of a policy framework for private projects. IFC is&#13;
also discussing the possibility of supporting demonstration projects in key infrastructure&#13;
sectors including transportation, which are based on sound principles of limited-recourse&#13;
financing. This participation could be in the form of equity investment, A loans and&#13;
B loans, and/or investment-related advisory services.&#13;
2.32  MIGA. MIGA offers long-term coverage for specific political risks, i.e., currency&#13;
transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract (in a narrowly&#13;
defined manner), with a focus on risk coverage of equity investments and associated&#13;
shareholder loans or loans by commercial banks so long as equity in the project is also&#13;
insured by the agency. In China, the absence of a convertibility law precludes coverage&#13;
by MIGA of hard currency exchange.&#13;
2.33   Coordination among the Bank Group. As to policy dialogue, the Bank will&#13;
continue to collaborate with China to help develop a policy and regulatory framework&#13;
and a transparent procurement process for privately financed highway projects. As&#13;
regards credit support, because neither IFC nor MIGA requires counter guarantees, these&#13;
organizations would likely be included in the initial discussion on private projects. The&#13;
Bank, through its lending and guarantee programs, could play a significant,&#13;
complementary financing role for large private highway projects that require resources&#13;
beyond the limited capacity of IFC and MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN GUANGDONG AND HUNAN&#13;
A. GEOGRAPHY AND TRANSPORT&#13;
3.1   Guangdong Province is located on the South China Sea at the southeastern&#13;
corner of China. As of 1995, Guangdong had a population of 66.9 million covering an&#13;
2~~~~~~~&#13;
area of 178,000 km2. Excluding the many small islands along the coastline, the&#13;
population density was 376 people per km . Topographically, Guangdong is high in the&#13;
north and low in the south, with wide areas of hills and low mountains. Almost 75&#13;
percent of the total area is mountainous and hilly. The coastline is long and winding,&#13;
measuring more than 4,300 km along the mainland area. The province, with Guangzhou&#13;
as its capital, includes 3 economic zones, 21 provincial administered cities, 30 cities at&#13;
the county level, 45 counties and 3 autonomous counties. The economy of Guangdong&#13;
has grown by about 20 percent annually since 1980. Gross Output Value of Agriculture&#13;
and Industry (GOVAI) per capita in the project area was by 1994 at 1.73 times the&#13;
national average and the growth has also averaged nearly 20 percent per year since 1980.&#13;
3.2   Hunan Province is situated in the middle reaches of the Changjiang River in&#13;
south-central China. Stretching 900 km from east to west and 800 km from south to&#13;
north, Hunan has a total area of 210,000 km2. With mountains in the east, south and&#13;
west, the land generally slopes from south toward the north. The most common land&#13;
form in this region are hills that occupy about 50 percent of the total area. At the end of&#13;
1995, Hunan had a population of 63.0 million and its population density averaged&#13;
298 people per km2.  The province, with Changsha as its capital, is divided into&#13;
4 prefectures, 1 autonomous prefecture, 9 provincial administrated counties, 21 cities at&#13;
the county level, 69 counties and 7 autonomous counties. The economy of Hunan has&#13;
grown by about 9 percent annually since 1980. GOVAI per capita in the project area was&#13;
by 1994 at half the national average and the growth has averaged about 11 percent per&#13;
year since 1980.&#13;
3.3   Transport Networks. The strategic location of both Guangdong and Hunan&#13;
provinces at the crossroads of major North-South and East-West expressway, waterway&#13;
and railway corridors attracts large amounts of traffic. Transport demand has grown&#13;
substantially over the last five years, in view of sustained economic growth in the&#13;
provinces and the rest of the country.&#13;
3.4  In Guangdong, roads and inland waterways are the principal modes for short-haul&#13;
transport; and railways and coastal shipping are the principal modes for interprovincial&#13;
transport. Guangdong Province has intersecting waterways open to navigation in all four&#13;
seasons. The province has 19 seaports, of which 5 are classified as major. Inland&#13;
transportation is based on the Pearl River system, which has three main navigable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
tributaries. The length of inland waterways in 1994 amounted to 10,808 km. The&#13;
railway network is relatively limited, compared to that of neighboring provinces such as&#13;
Hunan. The five main lines connect the ports of Huangpu, Guangzhou and Zhanjiang&#13;
with the rest of the country, and also serve as an export link to Hong Kong. At the end of&#13;
1994, the total mileage open to traffic amounted to 1,725 km.&#13;
3.5   Historically railways and inland waterways are the main transport modes in&#13;
Hunan province. Hunan is served by five main railways: Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-&#13;
Jiangxi, Hunan-Guinzhou, Hunan-Guangxi, and Zhicheng-Liuzhou, the operational&#13;
length of which at the end of 1994 was 2,600 km. Four tributaries of the Yangtze River&#13;
system flow into Dongting Lake in the north of Hunan, from where they enter the&#13;
Yangtze.  Hunan has a total of 10,010 km of inland waterways.  The principal&#13;
commodities transported by railroads and inland waterways are coal, grain, mineral stone&#13;
and construction material.&#13;
3.6   The highway network in Guangdong comprises some 83,000 km, of which only&#13;
about 7,400 km (about 10 percent of the total) include expressways, and class I and II&#13;
roads. Between 1981 and 1994, the road network in Guangdong grew in length by about&#13;
3 percent per year. The highway network in Hunan comprises some 58,800 km, of which&#13;
only 1,747 km (about 3 percent of the total) are class I and II roads. The roads with&#13;
bituminous and cement pavements amount to only 12,408 km (21 percent of total). The&#13;
administrative classification of the road network in both provinces at the end of 1994 was&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Guangdong Province           Hunan Province&#13;
Road Classification      km       Percent           km         Percent&#13;
National                4,180         5           4,041           7&#13;
Provincial              9,048        11           6,014          10&#13;
County                 14,673        18          22,187          38&#13;
Villager               55,053        66          25,434          43&#13;
Special                   102         0           1,127           2&#13;
Total               83,055       100           58,803        100&#13;
3.7   As in the rest of the country, most of the highways in Guangdong and Hunan were&#13;
built in the 1960s and 1970s, and their design standards were suitable for the light&#13;
vehicles and low traffic levels prevailing in China at the time. Due to the substantial&#13;
growth in traffic levels and steady rise in the use of heavy vehicles, these roads have&#13;
increasingly become inadequate to meet present and future needs.&#13;
3.8   Vehicle Fleet. The vehicle fleet in Guangdong grew more than five times in nine&#13;
years between 1986 and 1994, on an average of 20 percent per year. The fleet of large&#13;
trucks, buses and agricultural tractors grew between 9 and 17 percent per year. The fleet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
of passenger cars, light vans and pickups grew at 22 percent per year, reflecting the&#13;
growth in prosperity as well as the light-vehicle needs of the growing number of smaller&#13;
enterprises in the evolving socialist market economy. The most rapid growth occurred in&#13;
the motorcycle fleet at 32 percent per year, reflecting the desire for personal mobility now&#13;
made affordable through growing prosperity. The vehicle fleets in Hunan have expanded&#13;
more than four times between 1980 and 1994, at an average growth rate of 11 percent per&#13;
year. Similar to Guangdong, the fastest growth rate occurred in the motorcycle fleet at 30&#13;
percent per year.&#13;
B. TRAFFIC GROWTH AND ROAD SAFETY&#13;
3.9   Traffic. In Hunan freight and passenger traffic from 1985 to 1994 grow at about&#13;
4 and 3 percent per year, respectively (Table 3.1). In freight and passenger traffic, the&#13;
fastest growing mode during this period was air transport, which grew at 29 and&#13;
49 percent per year, respectively. The highway mode followed at about an annual&#13;
4-5 percent. By the year 1994, about 90 percent of all passenger movements were&#13;
undertaken by road transport. However, around 52 percent of all passenger-km occurred&#13;
by rail while about 48 percent of passenger-km occurred by road.&#13;
3. 1 0 In Guangdong, traffic growth from 1985 to 1994 was strong. Freight traffic grew&#13;
at over 9 percent per year, with the strongest growth in road and water transport (Table&#13;
3.1). Water and air transport dominate freight transport, with rail carrying a much&#13;
smaller proportion of traffic than elsewhere in China. Passenger transport also grew at&#13;
well over 6 percent per year, with the strongest growth in air transport at 18 percent per&#13;
year, following by rail transport at 8 percent and highway transport at almost 7 percent&#13;
per year. Similar to Hunan, by 1994, highways accounted for 90 percent of all passenger&#13;
movements, and 75 percent of passenger-km.&#13;
3.11  Safety. Road safety is a serious problem in Guangdong and Hunan Provinces, as&#13;
elsewhere in China. Generally, the number of traffic accidents has increased less rapidly&#13;
than the growth in traffic volume or vehicle registration. In Hunan, while the absolute&#13;
number of accidents and injuries has declined since 1990, as has the fatality rate per&#13;
10,000 vehicles, the proportion of fatalities has been increasing, suggesting more serious&#13;
accidents with higher frequency of death. Further, despite recent declines, the fatality&#13;
rates for both Hunan and Guangdong, like those for China as a whole, remain higher than&#13;
rates in many developed and developing countries. International comparisons of the&#13;
number of people killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles show a rate from 20 times&#13;
higher in Hunan and 5 times higher in Guangdong than that in Western industrial&#13;
countries (41.4 for Hunan, 10.0 for Guangdong, 46.0 for China, 2.0 and 2.4 for the United&#13;
States and Germany, respectively).&#13;
3.12  Primary responsibility for road safety now lies with the Traffic Police of the&#13;
Public Security Bureau (PSB), including that for vehicle testing and inspection, licensing,&#13;
propaganda on safety, enforcement of traffic laws, including imposition of fines,&#13;
operation of traffic signals, highway patrols, and all aspects of accident reporting,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
investigation and research.   However, the Guangdong and Hunan Provincial&#13;
Communications Departments (GPCD and HPCD) retain responsibility for all matters&#13;
concerning safe highway design and traffic signs and markings and driver training. In&#13;
Guangdong, GPCD and the Traffic Police would work together under the project to&#13;
develop an expressway safety program to reduce the growing numbers of expressway&#13;
accidents. In Hunan, HPCD would launch a road safety program primarily dealing with&#13;
the matters within the HPCD's jurisdiction.&#13;
C. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION, PLANNING AND FINANCING&#13;
3.13  Administration.  The Provincial Communication Departments (PCD) of&#13;
Guangdong and Hunan administer most of the highway and waterway transport activities&#13;
in their provinces, and are responsible to their respective provincial governments for&#13;
highway planning, budgeting, and financing. The PCDs adhere to the general transport&#13;
policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC.&#13;
3.14  The administration of the road network in the two project provinces takes place at&#13;
the levels of: (a) the PCDs, (b) the municipal and prefecture highway bureaus, and (c) the&#13;
local highway units of the county highway bureaus. The PCDs administer the provincial&#13;
highways through their Provincial Highway Administration Bureaus while the municipal&#13;
and county transport bureaus administer local highways and village roads. The provincial&#13;
bureaus are responsible for all highway matters (apart from the high-grade highway&#13;
program, as described below), including construction and maintenance, and these bureaus&#13;
receive professional and technical guidance from the Highway Administration&#13;
Department of MOC. They have a staff of 382 and 252 at the Guangdong and the Hunan&#13;
headquarters, respectively. The 21 municipal and prefectural highway bureaus and the 78&#13;
county bureaus in Guangdong Province have a total staff of about 63,000, of which&#13;
technical personnel comprises about 15 percent. In Hunan Province, the municipal and&#13;
prefectural highway bureaus number 14, and the county bureaus 105, with a total staff of&#13;
about 49,000, of which technical personnel comprise about 18 percent.&#13;
3.15 The Guangdong Provincial Freeway Company (GPFC) is a department-level&#13;
institution that reports directly to GPCD and is responsible for the organization,&#13;
direction, coordination, planning, design, construction, supervision, traffic surveillance&#13;
and control, telecommunication, operation and maintenance of all expressway projects in&#13;
the province, as well as for counterpart business service for expressways, such as&#13;
refueling, rescue, spare parts supply and real estate management. Also, it is partially&#13;
responsible for mobilizing construction funds, including the collection of tolls on all&#13;
expressways. It currently has a staff of 1,213 people, of which 377 are technicians.&#13;
There are 14 companies and 2 preparation offices controlled by GPFC (8 expressway&#13;
companies, I environmental protection division, 2 bridge companies, 2 traffic and&#13;
highway engineering companies, 1 development company, and 1 highway equipment&#13;
rental company). In Hunan Province, Hunan Provincial Expressway Construction and&#13;
Development Corporation (HPECDC) is in charge of construction, operation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
management of high-grade toll roads in the province. HPECDC is a department-level&#13;
institution that reports directly to HPCD. HPECDC's staff currently numbers 456.&#13;
3.16 Planning. The Hunan and Guangdong PCDs have overall responsibility for&#13;
planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the provincial highway networks.&#13;
The highway administration units at the prefecture, county and village levels have&#13;
considerable autonomy in planning smaller investments, which are nonetheless subject to&#13;
approval by the PCDs. Each administrative group prepares investment plans for the&#13;
highway network under its jurisdiction and submits these to the planning divisions of the&#13;
PCDs each year for the next year's plan. The PCDs approve the yearly plans for each&#13;
county or local authority concerned. Similarly, using inputs forn the lower-level&#13;
administrative groups, the PCDs prepare their five-year road development plans,&#13;
reflecting national and provincial development policy guidelines and objectives for the&#13;
planed period. The current Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP) (1996-2000) for highway&#13;
investment and maintenance in Hunan and Guangdong require a total of Y 95.3 billion&#13;
(Y 23.8 billion in Hunan, Y 72.5 billion in Guangdong).&#13;
3.17 Financing. Funding for highway construction and maintenance comes from&#13;
several sources, but by far the two largest sources are the Road Maintenance Fee, used for&#13;
maintenance needs and that provided about 39 percent and 47 percent of all highway&#13;
funding in Hunan and Guangdong during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (8FYP) (1990-95),&#13;
respectively, and the Highway Key Construction Fund for new construction and that&#13;
provided about 20 percent and 37 percent, respectively. Highway funding sources and&#13;
expenditures are summarized in Table 3.2a for Hunan Province and Table 3.2b for&#13;
Guangdong Province. The Road Maintenance Fee is collected from all motor vehicles.&#13;
The total amount collected from cars, vans and trucks is retained by the PCDs, while the&#13;
amount collected from tractors and other agricultural vehicles is managed by prefectures,&#13;
cities and counties. Such vehicles as military and police cars, fire trucks, city buses and&#13;
city garbage trucks are exempted from highway maintenance fees, also the party and&#13;
government vehicles are partly exempted. Since 1996, the balance of the revenues from&#13;
road maintenance fees is generally distributed as follows: 2.63 percent to the Public&#13;
Security Bureaus in both provinces and about 4 percent to the transport fees collection&#13;
sector in Hunan. The road maintenance fee retained by Hunan Province increased from&#13;
Y 3,070 million for the 8FYP to Y 5,410 million for the 9FYP and from Y 13,832 million&#13;
in 8FYP to Y 25,524 million in 9FYP in Guangdong Province.&#13;
3.18  The Highway Key Construction Fund was established by the provincial&#13;
governments for the construction of high-grade highways and bridges and its sources are:&#13;
(a) fees being collected from vehicles owned by the provinces and operated in highway&#13;
passenger and freight transportation (the standard fees are: Y 20 per month for trucks and&#13;
Y 0.02 per person-km for buses), (b) the car purchasing fee (collected as 3 percent of the&#13;
total transaction), and (c) the highway and bridge toll revenues. Revenues from the&#13;
Highway Key Construction Fund increased from Y 1,580 million during the 8FYP to&#13;
Y 3,022 million during the 9FYP in Hunan and from Y 10,907 million to Y 13,911&#13;
million in Guangdong. Other sources of revenue for highways include: (a) subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
from MOC, calculated as Y 4 million per km of new construction; (b) local funds from&#13;
governments at prefecture, city and county levels; (c) Aid-poverty Fund; and (d) loans&#13;
from foreign and local banks (for details on highway financing see Tables 3.2a and 3.2b).&#13;
Subsidies from MOC and local governments also substantially increased from Y 1,710&#13;
million for the 8FYP to Y 4,350 million for the 9FYP in Hunan and from Y 3,620 million&#13;
for the 8FYP to Y 23,881 million for the 9FYP in Guangdong. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show&#13;
the distribution of highway revenues and expenditures for Hunan and Guangdong,&#13;
respectively, for 9FYP.&#13;

3.19   The highway network in Guangdong expanded between 1985 and 1995 from&#13;
64,100 km to 83,100 km and in Hunan from about 56,000 km to about 59,000 km.&#13;
During the 7FYP and 8FYP (1986-95), expenditures required for this expansion,&#13;
including highway construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance totaled Y 44,600&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
million, of which Y 9,600 million were spent in Hunan, and Y 35,000 million in&#13;
Guangdong. Of this total, construction of new highways and highway improvement&#13;
amounted to Y 33,352 million during the 8FYP, or about 85 percent of total highway&#13;
expenditures in Hunan and Guangdong (Tables 3.2a and 3.2b)&#13;
D. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
3.20  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are engineered by the planning and&#13;
design institutes at the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. The provincial planning&#13;
and design institutes are responsible for designing all major road, bridge, and tunnel&#13;
projects in the province. These design institutes are, in general, competent and have on&#13;
staff experienced personnel for carrying out highway design tasks. Various national and&#13;
provincial planning and design institutes designed sections of the Jingzhu Expressway&#13;
under the project.&#13;
3.21  Construction. Small-scale roads and bridges in the provinces are constructed by&#13;
the construction units of the highway department of each city or county. The Highway&#13;
Administration Bureaus of the PCDs are responsible for the construction of large- and&#13;
medium-size highways and bridges. GPFC in Guangdong and HPECDC in Hunan are&#13;
responsible for the construction of high-grade highways. Since SPC directed that all&#13;
major civil works are to be awarded after competitive bidding, many of the larger&#13;
construction divisions are being reorganized into financially independent contracting&#13;
companies and have been awarded contracts either individually or as partners in joint&#13;
ventures on previous Bank-financed highway projects.&#13;
3.22  Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by county highway bureaus&#13;
under the control of municipal authorities. Maintenance is generally well organized and&#13;
carried out, mainly through labor-intensive operations. Expenditures for periodic and&#13;
routine maintenance in Guangdong and Hunan increased about 132 percent and&#13;
74 percent from the 7FYP to the 8FYP, respectively. However, as a percentage of total&#13;
expenditures for the highway sector, they decreased from about 35 percent during the&#13;
7FYP to about 21 percent during 8FYP in Hunan (Table 3.2a). In Guangdong, routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance expenditures as a percentage of total highway expenditures also&#13;
declined during the same period but at a smaller rate, from about 16 percent to 13 percent&#13;
(Table 3.2b).&#13;
E. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 1996-2000&#13;
3.23  9FYP for Hunan Highway Sector. The 9FYP comprises a total expenditure&#13;
volume of Y 23.7 billion (about $2.9 billion equivalent), of which Y 16.8 billion&#13;
(70 percent) would be for new road construction and Y 5.8 billion (24 percent) for road&#13;
maintenance and upgrading (Table 3.3a).&#13;
3.24 The 9FYP financing volume when compared with the 8FYP highway&#13;
expenditures would increase by a factor of 3.0. While the construction investments in&#13;
absolute terms would increase by a factor of 3.0, and the maintenance expenditures in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
absolute terms would grow by a factor of 3.5. The relative share of maintenance would&#13;
increase from 21 percent to 24 percent, and the relative proportion of new construction&#13;
would remain unchanged at 70 percent.&#13;
3.25  Highway sector funding for the 9FYP will come from the following five principal&#13;
sources:&#13;
(a)   Y 6.0 billion from Road Maintenance Fund;&#13;
(b)   Y 5.5 billion from the Highway Key Construction Fund;&#13;
(c)   Y 2.9 billion financed by prefectures and counties;&#13;
(d)   Y 3.4 billion in subsidies from MOC and MOF; and&#13;
(e)   Y 5.8 billion from World Bank loans and other foreign loans.&#13;
3.26 The proposed 9FYP (Table 3.4a) contains as the principal investment completion&#13;
of the 532 km Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway crossing Hunan from north (Hubei border) to&#13;
south (Guangdong Border) and costing Y 12.3 billion (about $1.46 billion equivalent), of&#13;
which Y 0.7 billion has been invested during the 8FYP and Y 11.6 billion will be&#13;
invested during the 9FYP. The Tucheng-Yizhan Expressway will absorb 54 percent of&#13;
highway sector funds for the 9FYP.&#13;
3.27  Other important investments of the 9FYP comprise:  (a) Y 1.6 billion for&#13;
construction of Changsha-Changde class I auto only national highway; (b) Y 3.5 billion&#13;
for eight main provincial highways and two major bridges that are located in the west and&#13;
north of Hunan province; and (c) Y 0.75 billion for construction and upgrading of&#13;
2,015 km of rural access roads in poverty areas.&#13;
3.28 Counterpart Funding. In Hunan, the total project investment for NH2 amounts&#13;
to Y 4.2 billion ($0.51 billion), out of which the Bank will finance Y 1.7 billion ($0.2&#13;
billion), Y 0.4 billion ($0.05 billion) will be a grant from MOC and the remaining Y 1.7&#13;
billion ($0.2 billion) will come from the 9FYP and constitute about 10 percent of the new&#13;
construction expenditures for the 9FYP. The Province places the highest priority on this&#13;
project providing the necessary financing.&#13;
3.29 Maintenance Funding. The total expenditures for the road maintenance in 9FYP&#13;
are projected to total Y 5.8 billion, which amounts to 30 percent of total highway&#13;
expenditures. The main road maintenance source is the road maintenance fee (RMF) that&#13;
provides about 80 percent of the total expenditure for the road maintenance, the&#13;
remaining 20 percent is provided in the form of subsidies from MOC and local&#13;
governments. Routine and periodic maintenance and road upgrading expenditures would&#13;
be two times that of the 8FYP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.30  9FYP for Guangdong Highway Sector.  The 9FYP comprises a total&#13;
expenditure volume of Y72,464 million (about $8,731 million equivalent), of which&#13;
Y 49,983 million (69 percent) would be for new road construction and upgrading or&#13;
improvement and Y 16,621 million (23 percent) for road maintenance (Table 3.3b).&#13;
3.31  Highway sector funding for the 9FYP will come from the following principal&#13;
sources:&#13;
(a)   Y 25.5 billion from Road Maintenance Fund;&#13;
(b)   Y 13.9 billion from the Highway Key Construction Fund;&#13;
(c)   Y 21.1 billion financed by prefectures and counties;&#13;
(d)   Y 2.8 billion in subsidies from MOC;&#13;
(e)   Y 5.4 billion domestic loans; and&#13;
(f)   Y 3.7 billion from World Bank loans and other foreign loans.&#13;
3.32 The 9FYP financing volume, when compared with the 8FYP highway&#13;
expenditures, would increase by a factor of 2.4. While the construction investments in&#13;
absolute terms would increase by a factor of 7.0, the maintenance expenditures in&#13;
absolute terms would grow by a factor of 4.0. The relative share of maintenance would&#13;
increase from 13 percent to 23 percent, and the relative proportion of new construction&#13;
would increase from 24 percent to 69 percent.&#13;
3.33  The estimated amount of Y 49,983 million will include the implementation of&#13;
major expressway projects:  the construction of the Kaiping-Zhanjiang, Xiaotang-&#13;
Gangtang and Gangtag-Taihe sections of expressways estimated at Y 20,699 million; the&#13;
class I auto-only and class II highways estimated at Y 27,239 million; and the&#13;
construction of local highways and aid-poverty roads at Y 2,045 million (Table 3.4b).&#13;
3.34  The investment program is divided into (a) expressway and (b) class I and II&#13;
highway subprograms.&#13;
(a)   The expressway subprogram comprises 671 km of new construction and&#13;
382 km of ongoing construction, at an estimated cost of Y 25.5 billion;&#13;
(b)   The class I and II highway subprogram comprises construction and&#13;
upgrading of 1,426 km of class I highways at a cost of Y 12.3 billion; and&#13;
some 3,735 km of class II highways at a cost of some Y 14.94 billion.&#13;
3.35  Counterpart Funding. In Guangdong, the total project investment for NH2&#13;
amounts to Y 5.2 billion ($0.63 billion), out of which the Bank will finance Y 1.7 billion&#13;
($0.2 billion), Y 0.4 billion ($0.05 billion) will be a grant from MOC, and the remaining&#13;
Y 3.1 billion ($0.4 billion) will come from the 9FYP and constitute about 6 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
new construction expenditures for the 9FYP. The Province places the highest priority on&#13;
this project providing the necessary financing.&#13;
3.36 Maintenance Funding. Funding for maintenance comes from the RMF, which is&#13;
projected to total Y 25,524 million in 9FYP and provides about 35 percent of all highway&#13;
funding in Guangdong. About 65 percent of the RMF is allocated for routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance, 12 percent for new construction and road improvement or&#13;
upgrading of the national road classes I and II, 9 percent for repayment of loan interest&#13;
and the rest (14 percent) for overhead and others. Routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
expenditures would increase by about 26 percent over the 8FYP level. At the present time,&#13;
GPCD is in the process of adopting the maintenance management systems, such as road&#13;
data bank (RDB), pavement management system (PMS) and bridge maintenance system&#13;
(BMS) to improve the long-term planning in highway maintenance and management, the&#13;
estimation of future funding needs for highway upgrading and maintenance and the&#13;
allocation of funds.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
4.1   China's 9FYP (1996-2000) emphasizes a reduction in transport bottlenecks that&#13;
are now being recognized as a growing constraint to rapid economic development. The&#13;
diversification and structural transformation of the economy, toward more light and&#13;
agroindustry and more interprovincial trade, coupled with severe capacity constraints of&#13;
the railways, are causing an accelerating demand for road transport. This national pattern&#13;
also applies to the two project provinces of Guangdong and Hunan, and in particular to&#13;
the heavily traveled north-south transport corridor along National Highway 107, the spine&#13;
of the densely populated and economically dynamic eastern part of China. This corridor,&#13;
the location of the new Beijing-Zhuhai (Jingzhu) Expressway, linking the north and south&#13;
of China, crosses the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong over a&#13;
distance of approximately 2,500 km and has the highest priority among the 12 national&#13;
trunk routes in the NTHS. Once completed, it will connect Beijing with Guangdong's&#13;
fast growing Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong. It is designed as a high-grade, high-&#13;
performance facility, at a minimum four-lane standard, fully access-controlled, and will&#13;
be operated throughout as a toll highway.  Jingzhu is scheduled for substantial&#13;
completion by the year 2000.&#13;
4.2   The Bank is already heavily involved in the construction of substantial sections of&#13;
Jingzhu expressway, between Beijing and Guangzhou (see IBRD map 27558). Under the&#13;
ongoing National Highway (NH1) Project, two important sections are presently being&#13;
built in Hebei and Henan provinces and are progressing well. Under the Second National&#13;
Highway (NH2) Project, two priority sections in northern Guangdong and southern&#13;
Hunan will be undertaken. Under a future Third National Highway (NH3) Project that is&#13;
at an advanced preparation stage, several important expressway sections as well as a&#13;
major Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge under a B-O-T arrangement will be undertaken in&#13;
Hubei province. Finally, the newly proposed Fourth National Highway (NH4) Project&#13;
will cover two important expressway sections in Hunan and Hubei that will be linked to&#13;
the Yangtze bridge B-O-T scheme. These four National Highway Projects constitute a&#13;
well thought-out and well balanced series of investment operations, which assist GOC&#13;
and the concerned provinces in the timely completion of China's highest-priority&#13;
expressway corridor.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.3   Project Objectives. The project is the second in the series of NHI-NH2-NH3-&#13;
NH4 projects of Jingzhu expressway in Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Hebei&#13;
provinces. It builds on its predecessor NHI and precedes NH3 by about one year and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
NH4 by about two years. All four projects in the series would support an integrated&#13;
approach to expressway corridor development, with each of the four operations&#13;
contributing selected priority sections that will gradually develop into a full corridor&#13;
system.&#13;
4.4   The specific objectives of the NH2 project are to:&#13;
(a)   relieve road transport congestion and improve the integration of&#13;
interregional trade and commerce between Hunan and Guangdong by&#13;
assisting in the development of two key sections of the NTHS in the&#13;
principal North-South transport corridor;&#13;
(b)   strengthen institutional capacity at the Hunan and Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Communications Departments and related institutions, through provision&#13;
of training, technical assistance and equipment, in planning, design,&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance of Hunan's and Guangdong's&#13;
highway networks;&#13;
(c)   develop a policy dialogue in the areas of the commercialization and&#13;
corporatization  of  provincial  expressway  companies,  highway&#13;
maintenance management, and transport and economic integration; and&#13;
(d)   improve the safety of road transport.&#13;
4.5   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's program of support in the&#13;
highway sector will continue to assist China in the foreseeable future in the financing,&#13;
development, and management of this priority expressway system. By helping GOC to&#13;
plan and build the NTHS, of which the new Jingzhu Expressway is a key element, the&#13;
Bank supports this essential long-term solution to the serious transport problems facing&#13;
China, removing bottlenecks, facilitating interprovincial traffic, and promoting long-&#13;
distance and transit traffic. This in turn would help arrest a growing regionalism while&#13;
furthering the liberalization, facilitation, and cost reduction of transport, key requirements&#13;
for market-oriented reforms to succeed. Early completion of the expressway corridor&#13;
between Changsha and Guangzhou is vital to rapid future economic development of the&#13;
affected regions and would help realize the full economic benefits from large-scale&#13;
expressway development. The transport and economic integration study for the Hong&#13;
Kong-Guangzhou-Changsha corridor, by focusing on northern Guangdong and southern&#13;
Hunan, would help integrate these yet underdeveloped rural areas into the fast-growing&#13;
economies of the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong.&#13;
4.6   Bank support is also justified by project assistance to institutional development,&#13;
which, besides the provision of training and equipment, would include studies on&#13;
expressway commercialization and corporatization, and highway maintenance&#13;
management. This would facilitate the introduction of market principles and mechanisms&#13;
in highway operation, management and maintenance. Bank involvement is also expected&#13;
to benefit the design and quality of construction of expressways as well as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
improvement of road traffic safety. NH2 would additionally foster improved practices in&#13;
the areas of environment and resettlement of project-affected people, thus supporting the&#13;
Bank's country and sector assistance strategies.&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
4.7   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives (PO).&#13;
The key indicators are as follows.&#13;
PO (a):  (i) reduced congestion levels on roads parallel to the proposed new road&#13;
(traffic volume);&#13;
(ii) increased average travel speeds on roads parallel to the proposed new&#13;
road (km/hr);&#13;
PO (b):  (i) enhanced institutional capacity of HPCD and GPCD for specifically&#13;
defined areas [technical assistance (TA) person-months];&#13;
PO (c):  (i) improved  policy  framework  for highway  commercialization,&#13;
maintenance, and economic integration (in each policy area establishment&#13;
of action plan and its implementation); and&#13;
PO (d):  (i) reduced numbers of traffic accidents (number of fatalities and injuries&#13;
on existing roads).&#13;
In Annex , the following are delineated:&#13;
(a)   More specific description of performance indicators;&#13;
(b)   Baseline values;&#13;
(c)   Mid-term benchmarks;&#13;
(d)   Interim benchmark; and&#13;
(e)   Targets for each value.&#13;
Parameters, baselines and targeted values were developed by HPCD and GPCD for&#13;
review by the Bank and confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
4.8   The achievement of project output would be tracked by monitoring indicators,&#13;
listed below. Project output can be defined as immediate project targets and initial flows&#13;
of services, such as physical quantity (percent of the length of road constructed);&#13;
institutional strengthening (training achieved), and quality (safety initiatives,&#13;
environmental requirements). The following monitoring indicators were set up for some&#13;
of the key project components. There are time-bound monitorable targets that would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
described either as actual physical outputs or as a percentage of components&#13;
implemented.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators:&#13;
(a)   Percentage of the length of XLE (out of 169 km) and XGE constructed&#13;
(out of 109 km);&#13;
(b)   progress made in the implementation of the training component for HPCD&#13;
and GPCD and its affiliated institutions (person-months);&#13;
(c)   number of black spots of the highway safety program completed (out of&#13;
identified black spots);&#13;
(d)   progress made in purchasing equipment for HPCD and GPCD and its&#13;
affiliated institutions (as a percentage of its dollar value); and&#13;
(e)   progress made on the studies.&#13;
The proposed monitorable targets are shown in Annex 1.&#13;
D. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
4.9   The project comprises the following components:&#13;
(a)   Construction of: (i) Xiangtan to Leiyang Expressway (XLE), a 169-km&#13;
divided, four-lane, access-controlled toll highway in southern Hunan; and&#13;
(ii) Xiaotang to Gantang Expressway (XGE), a 109-km divided, four-lane,&#13;
access-controlled toll highway in northern Guangdong. The works would&#13;
include construction of administration, service and maintenance facilities&#13;
as well as the supply and installation of electrical, electronic and&#13;
mechanical (E&amp;M) equipment for tolling, telecommunication, traffic&#13;
monitoring, and lighting of interchanges, toll plazas and service areas;&#13;
(b)   Interconnecting roads programs in (i) Hunan, consisting of new&#13;
construction and upgrading of four roads, with a total length of 39 km,&#13;
including a new 16-km divided, four-lane, class I, Xiangtan-Zhuzhou&#13;
Highway (XZH), and in (ii) Guangdong, consisting of new construction&#13;
and upgrading of 10 short roads, with a total length of 2 km;&#13;
(c)   Construction of Loudi-Lianyuan Highway (LLH), an auto-only, access-&#13;
controlled, class II, connecting road of 60 km length;&#13;
(d)   Construction supervision services for XLE, XGE, the interconnecting&#13;
roads programs in Hunan and Guangdong including XZH, and LLH;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(e)   Studies/technical assistance in (i) highway maintenance management in&#13;
Hunan, (ii) expressway commercialization and corporatization in Hunan;&#13;
(iii) transport  and  economic  integration  in  Guangdong;  and&#13;
(iv) expressway safety in Guangdong and Hunan;&#13;
(f)   Staff training programs in Hunan and Guangdong, covering all aspects of&#13;
highway planning, design, construction, operation, finance and&#13;
maintenance; and&#13;
(g)   Equipment for: (i) control of construction quality and monitoring of the&#13;
environment; (ii) operation and maintenance of XLE and XGE after their&#13;
completion; (iii) maintenance of the provincial road network and RDB and&#13;
PMS in Hunan.&#13;
E. CIVIL WORKS CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.10  Construction of Xiangtan-Leiyang Expressway (XLE). The existing National&#13;
Road (NR) 107 between Xiangtan and Leiyang in Hunan is 196 km long and traverses&#13;
densely populated and industrial areas, with particularly heavy concentrations in the cities&#13;
of Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Hengyang and Leiyang. The existing road was recently upgraded&#13;
to class II standard with a subgrade width of 12 m. The pavement is generally 9 m wide,&#13;
with some bridges remaining only 7 m wide. These widths do not allow for separation of&#13;
fast- and slow-moving vehicles and result in low travel speeds. Moreover, the pavement&#13;
structure is generally weak. Recent large increases in traffic and expected future traffic&#13;
growth cannot be accommodated by the existing road beyond 1997 at an acceptable level&#13;
of service. Between 1993 and 1994, the average daily traffic (ADT) volume for the&#13;
whole road, converted to medium-size trucks, increased from 5,036 to 6,276, a growth of&#13;
25 percent. The widening of the existing road is not feasible along most of its length, due&#13;
to extensive frontage development and the high number of people that would need to be&#13;
resettled.&#13;
4.11  To establish the feasibility of XLE along a new alignment, several alternatives&#13;
were compared. The chosen alignment is located to the east of the existing NR 107, with&#13;
a maximum distance between NR 107 and the expressway alignment of about 20 km in&#13;
Hengyang. The alignment was chosen since it optimizes XLE's technical characteristics&#13;
and minimizes cost and the number of people to be resettled. It also provides sufficient&#13;
space for city development. XLE would be about 169 km long, consisting of four paved&#13;
lanes, each 3.75 m wide, with two shoulders at 3.5 m width and a medium at 3.0 m width,&#13;
in accordance with MOC's highway design standards. The width of the subgrade is&#13;
28.0 m. The width of the shoulders was increased from 2.5 m to 3.5 m to improve traffic&#13;
safety, in view of the large number of heavy trucks that will use XLE. The main&#13;
technical difficulties of the chosen alignment are (a) the crossing of the Xiangjiang and&#13;
the Mishui Rivers, requiring three larle bridges of 938 m, 832 m, and 513 m; and&#13;
(b) large earthworks of about 125,000 m /km, with about 50 percent in stonework. About&#13;
5 km of the expressway are to be built on soft soils and about 17 km in flood-prone areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
require special treatment. The three largest bridges would allow for extension to six lanes&#13;
at a later stage, if the emergency lanes were to be used for this purpose. The expressway&#13;
would be operated as a closed toll road and also includes 3 long bridges, 14 medium-size&#13;
bridges, 7 small bridges, 843 culverts and 155,900 m3 of retaining walls. One railway&#13;
bridge, 21 overpasses and 407 mixed underpasses would be constructed.&#13;
4.12  XLE would also include: (a) construction of nine interchanges, (b) three service&#13;
areas providing facilities for refueling and vehicle repair, restaurants, parking and resting,&#13;
(c) three additional rest areas providing facilities for refueling, parking and resting,&#13;
(d) three facilities for expressway administration and maintenance, and (e) electrical and&#13;
mechanical installations for toll collection, traffic monitoring, telecommunications and&#13;
lighting of all interchanges and annex areas. The preliminary and detailed engineering&#13;
designs for the expressway were undertaken and have been completed by the Hunan&#13;
Provincial Design Institute of Planning and Survey (HPDIPS) for all civil works. MOC's&#13;
Highway Engineering Consulting Corporation in Beijing is designing the electrical and&#13;
mechanical works. Preliminary designs were reviewed and approved by MOC. A&#13;
detailed description of the technical characteristics of XLE is presented in the project&#13;
files. The detailed engineering designs and bidding documents were completed in June.&#13;
They were reviewed by a team of Swedish consultants under trust-funding during June/&#13;
July 1996 and were found satisfactory.&#13;
4.13 Interconnecting Roads Program (IRP) for XLE. Given the high population&#13;
density and rapid growth of road transport in the Xiangtan-Zhuzhou-Hengyan-Leiyang&#13;
corridor, the opening of XLE would bring significant traffic increases to the existing road&#13;
system. While some of these roads have recently been upgraded, HPCD plans to improve&#13;
the remaining ones by 2000, the year of the planned opening of XLE. On the basis of a&#13;
comprehensive review of all existing and planned roads that would interconnect with&#13;
XLE at its nine interchanges, an IRP comprising four longer roads and several shorter&#13;
ones, with a total length of 39 km was developed and would be financed under the&#13;
project. This IRP is shown in Table 4.1a. Among these 4 roads, the Xiangtan-Zhuzhou&#13;
Highway (XZH) is the most important and largest investment. It is a 16-km long, 2x2-&#13;
lane, class I road that would link two important cities in Hunan with each other and to the&#13;
expressway. This interconnecting road would substantially reduce the distance between&#13;
these two cities and support two new development zones. XZH was designed by the&#13;
Design Department of the Changsha Communications Institute (CCI) while all other&#13;
interconnecting roads were designed by HPDIPS. The technical characteristics of XZH&#13;
are presented in the project files. The appraisal mission reviewed the proposed IRP and&#13;
confirmed its appropriateness.&#13;
4.14 Loudi to Lianyuan Highway (LLH) in Hunan. Construction of an auto-only,&#13;
access-controlled class II highway between Loudi and Lianyuan, with a length of 57 km,&#13;
has high priority under Hunan's 9FYP. This road would link two important industrial&#13;
cities presently lacking appropriate connection and forms part of a new route from&#13;
Changsha to Lianyuan, to be extended in future to western Hunan. It would cross the&#13;
Changsha-Xiangtan expressway section that is presently under construction with Asian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Development Bank (ADB) financing, pass through the Xiangtan-to-Dashiqiao&#13;
subsection of XLE and the proposed XZH between Dashiqiao and Xiangtan, and would&#13;
link to a new class I/class II highway between Xiangtan and Loudi where construction is&#13;
already ongoing. This new road would improve accessibility to Loudi and Lianyuan&#13;
from XLE and would therefore be an important complementary investment to Jingzhu.&#13;
The road comprises three interchanges including a 3-km long interconnecting road and&#13;
three junctions.  The chosen alignment does not encounter any major technical&#13;
difficulties. Engineering design was undertaken and has been completed by the design&#13;
department of CCI. The technical characteristics of LLH are presented in the project&#13;
files. All works-related cost estimates for LLH were reviewed and finalized by the&#13;
appraisal mission.&#13;
4.15 Construction of Xiaotang-Gantang Expressway (XGE). The existing NR 107&#13;
between Xiaotang (Hunan border) and Guangzhou is 395 km long and traverses mostly&#13;
rural areas. The road was recently upgraded to class II with a subgrade width of 12 m in&#13;
the south and 8.5 m in the north. This narrow pavement is due to the complex&#13;
topography in northern Guangdong. The main technical difficulty for NR 107 is the&#13;
crossing of the cities of Lianxian, Yangshan and Qingyuan. Overtaking along the&#13;
existing alignment is difficult and dangerous since strong longitudinal slopes slow down&#13;
most vehicles. In 1993, ADT for the whole line, converted to medium-size trucks, was&#13;
7,500 vehicles. There are two other important north-south roads, NR 106 and NR 105, at&#13;
class III or IV standards, and there exists Provincial Road (PR) 1947. These roads are&#13;
presently being upgraded, largely under the Bank-supported Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA). There is also a new 10-km long class I highway in&#13;
the north of Pingshi at the Hunan border and a new class II highway between Pingshi and&#13;
Ruyuan. Widening of the existing roads is not feasible along most of their lengths, due to&#13;
extensive frontage development and the high numbers of people that would need to be&#13;
resettled.&#13;
4.16 To establish the feasibility of Xiaotang-Gantang-Taihe Expressway along a new&#13;
alignment, several alternatives were compared. Any new alignment would have to cross&#13;
mountainous areas in the northern part and other topographical barriers in the south. The&#13;
chosen alignment differs substantially from the alignment of the existing NR 107,&#13;
enabling a large reduction in distance between the Hunan border and Guangzhou, and&#13;
giving much improved access to the industrial city of Shaoguan, the largest city in&#13;
northern Guangdong with a population of around 3 million inhabitants. While the&#13;
existing NR 107, from the Hunan border, takes a southwestern direction, the new&#13;
expressway goes to the southeast, in parallel to the existing PR 1947 between Pingshi and&#13;
Ruyuan and to the existing NR 323 between Ruyuan and Gantang. The distance between&#13;
NR 107 and XGE reaches a maximum of about 70 km in Gantang. The feasibility study&#13;
investigated two separate expressway sections, the northern section between the Hunan&#13;
border and Shaoguan (Xiaotang-Gantang), and the southern section between Shaoguan&#13;
and Guangzhou (Gantang-Taihe).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.17 The Chinese authorities have requested Bank funding of the northern section,&#13;
under the NH2 Project, while the southern section that would be constructed&#13;
simultaneously with the northern section, will be financed through Guangdong's own&#13;
resources. The southern section between Gantang and Taihe, a distance of 199 km,&#13;
would be built as a 2x2-lane expressway in a first stage, to be extended to 2x3 lanes at a&#13;
later stage as traffic increases. The feasibility study compared several alternatives and&#13;
recommended an alignment passing near Pingshi and Ruyuan. The chosen alignment&#13;
optimizes the expressway's technical characteristics, minimizes cost and the number of&#13;
people to be resettled. A detailed procurement and implementation schedule for the&#13;
northern and southern sections is presented in Annex 2.&#13;
4.18  XGE would be about 110 km long and is being designed in accordance with&#13;
MOC's highway design standards. Some 73 km, between Lingshi Ba and Ruyuan, are&#13;
located in mountainous terrain, while some 37 km between Xiaotang to Lingshi Ba,&#13;
Ruyuan and Gantang are located in heavy rolling terrain. In mountainous terrain, the&#13;
design speed is 80 km/h, and the cross-section consists of four paved lanes, each 3.75 m&#13;
wide, two emergency lanes 2 m wide, two berms at 0.75 m and a median at 2.5 m. The&#13;
width of the subgrade is 23 m. In heavy rolling terrain, the design speed is 100 km/h and&#13;
the cross-section consists of four paved lanes, each 3.75 m wide, two emergency lanes at&#13;
2.5 m wide, two berms at 1 m and a median at 2.5 m. The width of the subgrade is&#13;
24.5 m. The main technical difficulties are: (a) the very mountainous topography&#13;
resulting in many tunnels (14 two-lane tubes totaling about 14 km, with 6 more than&#13;
1,000 m length, the longest being 2,100 m), many bridges and viaducts (3 very large&#13;
bridges of, respectively, 1,593 m, 1,122 m and 648/2 m; 30 long bridges totaling&#13;
8,214 m); and (b) substantially more earthworks than usual, about 200,000 m3/km, with&#13;
about two thirds in stonework, very deep cuts reaching 50 m and high fills reaching 30 m,&#13;
and many retaining walls (about 640,000 m3). The expressway would be operated as a&#13;
closed toll road and would also comprise 2 medium-size bridges, 7 small bridges, 270&#13;
culverts and 642,000 m3 of retaining walls.  In addition, 25 grade separations, 6&#13;
interchanges, 29 pedestrian underpasses, and 22 mixed underpasses would be&#13;
constructed.&#13;
4.19  XGE would also include construction of: (a) six interchanges, (b) two service&#13;
areas providing facilities for refueling, restaurants, hotels, parking and resting, (c) two&#13;
rest areas providing facilities for parking and resting, (d) two facilities for administration&#13;
and maintenance of XGE, (e) electrical and mechanical installations for toll collection,&#13;
traffic monitoring, telecommunications and lighting of toll plazas and all annex areas.&#13;
The preliminary and detailed engineering designs for the expressway (northern and&#13;
southern sections) were undertaken and have been completed by MOC's Second&#13;
Highway Survey and Design Institute (SHSDI) in Wuhan. MOC's HRI is in charge of&#13;
the electrical and mechanical works. Preliminary designs were reviewecl and approved by&#13;
MOC. The detailed engineering designs and bidding documents will be reviewed by a&#13;
team of Austrian consultants under trust funding during March/April 1997. All works&#13;
related cost estimates for XGE were reviewed and finalized by the appraisal mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.20 Interconnecting Roads Program (IRP) for XGE. The Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Highway Administration Bureau (GPHAB) under GPCD is presently implementing a&#13;
substantial Interconnecting Road Program (IRP) in the influence area of XGE,&#13;
comprising the upgrading and improvement of 10 national, provincial and county roads,&#13;
with a total length of some 240 km. This IRP is in part financed by the Bank-supported&#13;
Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA) and in part funded through&#13;
Guangdong's own highway resources. The 10 IRP roads are already being linked to the&#13;
six interchanges on XGE through a second IRP to be funded under the project, consisting&#13;
of 10 short access roads, with a total length of about 2 km. This IRP is shown in Table&#13;
4. lb. The appraisal mission reviewed the second IRP and confirmed its appropriateness.&#13;
4.21  Construction Supervision. Training programs in construction supervision for&#13;
local staff in Hunan and Guangdong would be completed prior to the mobilization of&#13;
contractors. This training would be conducted by the two international supervision&#13;
consultants that will be selected. The first phase of the training program, prior to the&#13;
beginning of construction, would include lecture courses and site visits while the second&#13;
phase would comprise on-the-job training to take place during construction of XLE and&#13;
XGE.&#13;
4.22  In Hunan, the construction supervision organization for XLE would consist of a&#13;
joint foreign/local core supervision team to be established around three foreign engineers&#13;
(with a total of 108 person-months), with expertise in project/contract management, earth&#13;
and pavement works, and bridge construction. The core team would also include four&#13;
local engineers and would be located at HPECDC's General Supervisor's Office in&#13;
Hengyang where it would be supported by a central laboratory to be staffed with&#13;
10 qualified local experts. For field supervision of 11 ICB civil works contracts, four&#13;
resident engineer's offices (REO) would be established in Zhuzhou, Hengdong,&#13;
Hengyang and Leiyang, staffed with 121 persons. There would also be a logistics staff&#13;
comprising 34 persons. A total of 169 local supervisors would be engaged corresponding&#13;
to one person per km of expressway construction. Domestic supervising engineers would&#13;
provide some 6,500 person-months. Supervision of civil works for XZH and LLH would&#13;
be carried out by qualified local supervision teams acceptable to the Bank.  These&#13;
supervision arrangements were reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province would maintain construction&#13;
supervision teams with qualified staff in adequate numbers to ensure that works are&#13;
carried out in accordance with technical specifications and that strict quality controls&#13;
are exercised on site. Construction quality would also be monitored through routine&#13;
project supervision and monthly and quarterly progress reports.&#13;
4.23  In Guangdong, the supervision organization for construction of XGE would&#13;
consist of a joint foreign/local core supervision team to be established around three&#13;
foreign engineers (with a total of 120 person-months) with expertise in project/contract&#13;
management, earth and pavement works, and traffic engineering, as well as tunnel and&#13;
bridge construction. This core team will be located at GPFC's Supervisor's Office in&#13;
Shaoguan and will be supported by a central laboratory to be staffed with 12 qualified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
local experts. For field supervision of 13 ICB civil works contracts, 10 REOs will be&#13;
established.  They will be staffed with 110 local engineers for field supervision&#13;
corresponding to about one engineer per km of expressway construction. Domestic&#13;
supervising engineers will provide some 5,000 person-months.  These supervision&#13;
arrangements were reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province would maintain construction&#13;
supervision teams with qualified staff in adequate numbers to ensure that works are&#13;
carried out in accordance with technical specifications and that strict quality controls&#13;
are exercised on site. Construction quality would also be monitored through routine&#13;
project supervision and monthly and quarterly progress reports.&#13;
F. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING&#13;
4.24 Highway Maintenance Management in Hunan. To improve and modernize&#13;
maintenance management in Hunan, HPCD would proceed with a highway maintenance&#13;
management study. The overall objective would be to create an efficient maintenance&#13;
organization, adjusted to modem management philosophy and using modem technology.&#13;
The study will be managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading Group&#13;
will be in charge of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province. The&#13;
study will commence in January 1997 and finish before the end of 1998. The study&#13;
would: (a) review the institutional arrangements, policies and procedures for highway&#13;
maintenance, consistent with the economic reform process; (b) identify expenditures&#13;
required to maintain the existing road network, taking budget constraints into&#13;
consideration; and (c) formulate and prioritize a multiyear highway maintenance program&#13;
for the later part of the 9FYP period. The outcome of the study would include&#13;
recommendations on (a) organizational changes; (b) equipment needs; (c) training of&#13;
personnel; (d) a model to estimate medium-term maintenance needs; (e) strengthening of&#13;
Hunan's RDB and PMS; and (f) development of a BMS. Final terms of reference (TOR)&#13;

works and actual expenditures of the previous year against the planned physical targets&#13;
and budgeted funds of that year, for new construction, upgrading/improvement,&#13;
rehabilitation, periodic maintenance, and routine maintenance; and (c) show the targets&#13;
of the highway program for the current year, including new construction, upgrading/&#13;
improvement, rehabilitation, periodic maintenance, and routine maintenance, in terms of&#13;
planned physical works and planned expenditures.&#13;
4.26 Expressway Commercialization and Corporatization in Hunan. This study&#13;
would assist HPCD in developing modern thinking in how to finance and manage its new&#13;
expressways and would analyze the longer-term options available in financing, managing&#13;
and organizing its high-grade highway corporation(s). It would help design a modem&#13;
organization in compliance with international standards of financial management, would&#13;
ensure that toll revenues are properly collected and managed and that expenditures (both&#13;
for investment and for adequate maintenance) are well planned. The study will be&#13;
managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading Group will be in charge&#13;
of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province. Final TOR are available&#13;
in the project file.  Final TOR were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province shall: (a) by June 30,&#13;
1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the concerned provincial&#13;
agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the results and&#13;
recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in accordance with&#13;
TOR satisfactory to the Bank and furnish a draft final report thereof to the said Leading&#13;
Group and the Bank for review and comments, (c) furnish the final report of said study,&#13;
taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the Bank, to the Bank not&#13;
later than six months following receipt of comments made by the Bank on said draft final&#13;
report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations&#13;
set out in saidfinal report.&#13;
4.27 Road Safety in Hunan. Four road safety components would be undertaken,&#13;
concentrating on institutional improvements, training, accident data collection and&#13;
analysis, and the identification and implementation of physical measures. The safety&#13;
components will be managed by a Leading Group established in 1996. The Leading&#13;
Group will be in charge of the studies and the road safety activities in Hunan Province.&#13;
The road safety activities should be initiated under the NH2 project and continued under&#13;
the NH4 project. First, Hunan's Traffic Engineering Society (TES), during its annual&#13;
meetings, would start incorporating road safety issues in its agenda. This would form a&#13;
basis toward a developed road safety seminar arrangement that would become an annual&#13;
event. The basic concept for the seminar would be to create a better understanding of&#13;
road safety, and to learn lessons from other countries about road safety work. Domestic&#13;
and international experts would be invited to attend the annual seminar. Second, HPCD&#13;
would develop, through TA, a manual on safety at roadworks, enabling the organization&#13;
of roadworks under conditions tolerable to road users and workers, and requiring&#13;
solutions for, inter alia, comprehensive schemes for work zones and temporary traffic&#13;
operations, technological innovations, and monitoring users behavior and traffic. The&#13;
overall aim of this effort would be to develop a guideline suitable for roadworks in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Hunan. Different types of roadworks would be examined, from mobile and short-&#13;
duration to long-duration roadworks. Equipment and accessories used for temporary&#13;
signing, traffic guidance and the protection of workers would be examined. Third, HPCD&#13;
would develop, through TA, a safety audit manual, consisting of a series of checklists and&#13;
guidelines enabling systematic checking of highway engineering designs to ensure that&#13;
they do not contribute to but help reduce accidents. A start was already made through&#13;
various design improvements on XLE, for example, on the shapes of its interchanges, the&#13;
connections of annex areas to the expressway, or the locations of the maintenance centers.&#13;
Fourth, HPCD would undertake through TA the in-house development of a black-spot&#13;
analysis and improvement system, comprising the identification of black-spots; design,&#13;
funding, implementation of remedial measures; and conducting before and after studies.&#13;
The entire length of NR 107 in Hunan would be used to develop and test this system.&#13;
Final TOR are available in the project file. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
Hunan Province shall. (a) establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the&#13;
concerned provincial agencies to associate with TES and to incorporate road safety&#13;
issues into the agenda of its annual meetings, starting in 1997, and organize an annual&#13;
road safety seminar in Hunan starting 1998; (b) develop, through TA, a manual on safety&#13;
during roadworks, a safety audit schedule, and a program of selected black-spot analysis&#13;
and improvement along NR 107, and by June 30, 1999, complete the said three TA&#13;
components in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, (c) furnish&#13;
the TA results to the Leading Group and the Bank for review and comments; and&#13;
(d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations of the said&#13;
TA components, taking into account the comments thereon of the said Leading Group and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
4.28 Transport and Economic Integration in Guangdong. This study would&#13;
examine the long-term transport and economic integration effects of the transport corridor&#13;
between Hong Kong-Macao-Guangzhou-Changsha connecting several inland provinces&#13;
to the highly economically active Pearl River Delta. The movement of freight and people&#13;
will no longer be dependent on the much overloaded railway link. The completion of the&#13;
expressway would help to foster faster economic growth in northern Guangdong and&#13;
southern Hunan and promote economic integration of areas along the expressway&#13;
corridor. The study would also analyze the advantages of the various transport modes in&#13;
an intermodal transport framework and their impact on regional economics. Guangdong&#13;
Provincial Economic Research Institute, Xian Highway Transport University and&#13;
Guangdong Provincial Transport Association would be responsible for execution of the&#13;
study, while coordination would be undertaken by GPCD, with joint involvement of the&#13;
World Bank Finance Office and Research Institute under GPCD. Final TOR are&#13;
available in the project file. Final TOR were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province shall: (a) by June&#13;
30, 1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the concerned&#13;
provincial agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the results and&#13;
recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in accordance with&#13;
TOR satisfactory to the Bank and furnish a draft final report thereof to the said Leading&#13;
Group and the Bank for review and comments; (c) furnish the final report of said study,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the Bank, to the Bank not&#13;
later than six months following receipt of comments made by the Bank on said draftfinal&#13;
report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to implement the recommendations&#13;
set out in saidfinal report.&#13;
4.29 Expressway Safety in Guangdong. With the rapid expansion of the expressway&#13;
network in Guangdong, there is an increasing need to review the issue of road safety. Of&#13;
particular importance are the treatment and application of road safety knowledge and&#13;
techniques in the areas of traffic engineering design and in the operation and management&#13;
of expressways. The proposed TA would address the practical aspects of expressway&#13;
safety, with a view to develop implementable recommendations. In the course of this&#13;
work, standards, manuals, handbooks and operational procedures for incident&#13;
management, guarding and lighting of road works, expressway signing, marking and&#13;
lighting, traffic control and surveillance provisions, traffic management procedures, and&#13;
preferred organizational structure for expressway safety management would be&#13;
developed. Standards and manuals that are to be produced under the study would be&#13;
adjusted to the situation in Guangdong, in accordance with guidelines from MOC. Final&#13;
TOR are available in the project file. Final TOR for this TA were reviewed and agreed&#13;
during negotiations. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province&#13;
shall: (a) by June 30, 1997, establish a Leading Group comprising representatives of the&#13;
concerned provincial agencies to guide the said study and provide comments on the&#13;
results and recommendations thereof; (b) by June 30, 1999, carry out said study in&#13;
accordance with TOR satisfactory to the Bank andfurnish a draftfinal report thereof to&#13;
the said Leading Group and the Bank for review and comments; (c) furnish the final&#13;
report of said study, taking into account comments made by the Leading Group and the&#13;
Bank to the Bank not later than six months following receipt of comments made by the&#13;
Bank on said draft final report; and (d) thereafter, take all appropriate steps to&#13;
implement the recommendations set out in saidfinal report.&#13;
4.30 Training in Hunan. The training program would mainly focus on highway&#13;
planning and engineering design, construction and its supervision, maintenance and&#13;
operations management, including, but not limited to quality control, budget planning,&#13;
engineering economics, and road safety. The program would aim at training of&#13;
personnel needed for the project to guarantee its smooth implementation and progress. It&#13;
would also cover professional training on the part of personnel in the transport sector and&#13;
professional training for trainers. A training program has been prepared, which will&#13;
include the training of 80 people to be trained overseas for 110 person-months while 721&#13;
people will be trained in China. Three foreign experts will be engaged for about&#13;
3 person-months in the domestic training program. Detailed documentation and a&#13;
summary of the proposed training program is available in the project file. The training&#13;
program was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that Hunan Province shall, by June 30 of each year and commencing in&#13;
1997, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation program to the Bank for&#13;
approval and shall carry out the training under the approved program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
4.31  Training in Guangdong. The proposed program in construction supervision&#13;
training would focus on contract management, FIDIC conditions of contract, cost&#13;
management, construction management, quality and progress control. In addition to the&#13;
training in construction supervision, a series of training programs would be conducted in&#13;
project planning and design, highway engineering, construction, highway maintenance&#13;
and operation management. Depending on the nature of the training, the courses would&#13;
be provided either in China, by local institutions, or abroad, by foreign consultants. It has&#13;
been proposed that 108 people (122 person-months) will attend overseas training while&#13;
752 people (672 person-months) will be given domestic training. The proposed training&#13;
programs build on training that is being undertaken and nearing completion under the&#13;
ongoing Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA).   Detailed&#13;
documentation and a summary of the proposed training is available in the project file.&#13;
The training program was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that Guangdong Province shall, by June 30 of each year and&#13;
commencing in 1997, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation program to the&#13;
Bank for approval and would carry out the training under the approved program.&#13;
4.32  Equipment. Equipment to be provided under the project has been identified by&#13;
GPFC and HPCD and reviewed by the Bank. Agreed equipment lists including cost&#13;
estimates are available in the project file. These lists include, for both provinces,&#13;
equipment items required for expressway operation and maintenance, strengthening of&#13;
central laboratories, and environmental monitoring. In the case of Hunan, selected&#13;
equipment items for RDB and PMS development as well as for the maintenance of the&#13;
provincial highway network are also included. In Guangdong, the equipment list has&#13;
taken into consideration those items that were already procured under the ongoing&#13;
Guangdong Provincial Highway Project (Loan 3530-CHA). All equipment lists as&#13;
proposed by Hunan Province and Guangdong Province including cost estimates were&#13;
reviewed and confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
4.33  Hunan.  An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for XLE and its&#13;
interconnecting roads was carried out by the Highway Research Institute (HRI) of MOC&#13;
and an EIA report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) Summary were submitted to the Bank in March 1995. These&#13;
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with HPCD during the preparation&#13;
missions in April and July 1995. Based on the Bank's comments, the revised EIA&#13;
reports, EAPs for XLE including its interconnecting roads, and the EA Summary were&#13;
submitted to the Bank in September 1995 for review. These documents were further&#13;
reviewed and discussed during the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The EIA and&#13;
EAP for LLH, and an EIA report for XZH were also reviewed by the Bank at that time.&#13;
The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA Summary covering XLE and its interconnecting&#13;
roads, LLH and XZH, were submitted in January 1996 and found to be satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
4.34 Guangdong. An EIA for XGE including its interconnecting roads was carried&#13;
out by the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI) of MOC, and an EIA&#13;
report, an EAP, and an EA Summary were submitted to the Bank in May 1995. These&#13;
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with GPCD during the preparation&#13;
mission in July 1995. Based on the Bank's comments, the revised EIA reports, EAPs,&#13;
and the EA Summary for XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted to the Bank&#13;
in September 1995 for review. These documents were further reviewed and discussed&#13;
during the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA&#13;
Summary covering XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted in January 1996&#13;
and found to be satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.35  Ii both Hunan and Guangdong sections, major environmental impacts during the&#13;
construction period will include noise and dust, alteration of hydrological regimes, soil&#13;
erosion, interference with local people and traffic, and impacts on the local ecology and&#13;
on irrigation systems. Among others, noise and dust, and soil erosion would be most&#13;
serious. In addition, on XGE, in view of the large quantities of cut and fill works,&#13;
particular attention was paid to the impacts of transportation of construction materials.&#13;
Traffic noise and vehicle exhaust, soil erosion, and water pollution from service areas&#13;
were identified as major adverse impacts during the operation period.&#13;
4.36  The EAPs specify the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental monitoring&#13;
plans, institutional arrangements for their implementation, training and equipment&#13;
requirements, and budget needed for environmental protection. On both XLE and XGE,&#13;
major mitigation measures in the construction phase will include optimum planning of&#13;
earthworks to reduce damage to be caused by borrow and spoil works, appropriate design&#13;
of overpasses/underpasses to minimize interference with local people and traffic,&#13;
reconstruction of irrigation and drainage systems where appropriate, and water sprinkling&#13;
to reduce dust. On XGE, particular attention will be paid to optimum use of excavated&#13;
soil for filling works, and reduction of impacts of borrow material hauling trucks.&#13;
4.37  On both XLE and XGE, major mitigation measures in the operation phase will&#13;
include construction of noise barriers, construction/heightening of fences around the&#13;
residences to reduce traffic noise, strengthening of vehicle emission inspections and&#13;
better maintenance of vehicles to minimize air pollution problems, and afforestation to&#13;
improve landscape and reduce air pollution. The engineering design and technical&#13;
specifications for the expressways incorporate appropriate measures required for&#13;
environmental protection. It was ascertained that the proposed expressways and their&#13;
interconnecting roads, and other highways included in the NH2 Project in both Hunan&#13;
and Guangdong will not affect ecologically sensitive areas and that their construction and&#13;
operation should have no adverse impacts on the environment through the&#13;
implementation of EAPs. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs are presented in Annexes&#13;
3a and 3b, and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Project File and are also&#13;
available through the Public Information Center (PIC). Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations from Hunan Province and Guangdong Province that: (a) the environmental&#13;
protection measures stipulated in the EAPs with respect to XLE and its interconnecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads shall be carried out in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) Hunan Province and Guangdong Province shall&#13;
each furnish to the Bank annual environmental monitoring reports for XLE and its&#13;
interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads during their&#13;
construction phases and for each of the first three years following their construction&#13;
completion.&#13;
H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.38  Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for the project were prepared by the&#13;
Resettlement Offices (ROs) of GPFC and HPECDC for the two project provinces based&#13;
on the following laws and regulations:&#13;
(a)   The Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China for Land&#13;
Acquisition and Resettlement (1986);&#13;
(b)   Implementation Regulations for Land Administration of the People's&#13;
Republic of China (1991); and&#13;
(c)   Provincial and municipal regulations as listed in Annexes 4a and 4b.&#13;
4.39  Objectives. The RAPs establish the basis for land acquisition and resettlement in&#13;
the project and respond to the general Bank guidelines on involuntary resettlement. The&#13;
basic objectives of the RAPs are to: (a) minimize resettlement; (b) improve the standards&#13;
of living of the project-affected persons (PAPs) or at least to restore them; (c) consult the&#13;
affected communities on the project impact, entitlements, and rehabilitation measures;&#13;
(d) compensate the villages for land and the PAPs for their lost assets at replacement&#13;
value without depreciation; (e) provide land to the PAPs whose land is affected by&#13;
readjusting the village land; (f) provide alternative jobs to the PAPs losing agricultural&#13;
land if the land endowment of affected villages do not permit readjustment; (g) ensure&#13;
that PAPs whose jobs are affected through affected enterprises are provided with similar&#13;
employment in new enterprises; (h) compensate the disrupted infrastructure; (i) establish&#13;
the time schedule and the budget of the resettlement component of the project; (j) devise&#13;
a mechanism for grievance and appeals; and (k) devise internal and independent&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
4.40  The RAPs meet the general standards of transport sector RAPs for China and the&#13;
Bank Guidelines for Involuntary Resettlement. The RAPs are reviewed in detail in&#13;
Annexes 4a and 4b. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from Hunan and&#13;
Guangdong Provinces that all land acquisition and resettlement activities with respect to&#13;
XLE and its interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads&#13;
shall be completed in accordance with the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.41  Institutional Strengthening. The project addressed this issue by encouraging the&#13;
unification and computerization of the data at the preparation stage, with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
collaboration of local administrations and then sharing the data with the same local&#13;
offices. This approach also facilitated the consultation process at all levels, while&#13;
connecting the resettlement component of the project with the civil works by&#13;
superimposing the population and asset data on preliminary design maps. This approach&#13;
can lead to further reductions in resettlement and its cost in future transport projects by&#13;
improving resettlement minimization during preliminary design.&#13;
4.42  Adverse Impact of NH2 Project. The project will lead to permanent acquisition&#13;
of 32,785 mu, temporary acquisition of 4,958 mu of land, and removal of 1,828 private&#13;
houses in the two provinces. Most of the effect on houses will be in the more densely&#13;
populated Hunan Province. In Guangdong, the expressway will be shorter and pass&#13;
through a sparsely populated region of the province, affecting only 281 private houses.&#13;
Total number of households affected by the project will be 8,816 with a total population&#13;
of 39,167. Overall, 8,239 persons will need to relocate their houses, while another 30,926&#13;
will lose land only, of whom 1,433 would be transferred from agriculture to enterprise&#13;
employment due to limited land availability. Total enterprises affected by the project will&#13;
be 14 with an employment of 354 employees. Assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
from Hunan Province and Guangdong Province that the monitoring of the effectiveness&#13;
and socioeconomic impact of the resettlement activities with respect to XLE and its&#13;
interconnecting roads, LLH, XZH, and XGE and its interconnecting roads shall be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
4.43 Outstanding Issues Resolved During the Appraisal. The appraisal mission&#13;
ensured that all the points raised during the Bank's review of the RAPs were addressed&#13;
by the borrowers. Issues relating to consultation with the local units on land readjustment&#13;
has been completed, and a clear understanding was reached between the Provincial&#13;
Resettlement Offices and the Local Units on the extent and nature of resettlement impacts&#13;
and policies of compensation and rehabilitation. Surplus labor is being resettled after&#13;
consultation with them. PAPs will be able to exercise their choice among available&#13;
employment opportunities. Enterprises are being consulted on the terms of compensation&#13;
and timing of relocation to ensure the continuity of operations and the employment of&#13;
their workers. The mission observed that the PAPs were satisfied with the resettlement&#13;
altematives provided and the choices that they made. Selection and compensation of&#13;
enterprises that will employ the surplus labor is also being carried out with the&#13;
participation of all affected parties.&#13;
I. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.44  The total project is estimated to cost Y 9.40 billion or $1.13 billion equivalent,&#13;
including land acquisition, and physical and price contingencies as summarized in the&#13;
following table and as detailed in the Consolidated Project Cost Summary for Hunan and&#13;
Guangdong provinces and in Tables 4.2a and 4.2b. This estimate does not include taxes&#13;
which are estimated at Y 240 million. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at about&#13;
$432 million, or about 38 percent of the total. Base costs were estimated in late 1995&#13;
prices and were updated to 1996 prices in Hunan and Guangdong during project appraisal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
and reconfirmed during negotiations. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent&#13;
of the base cost of civil and E&amp;M works and construction supervision services. Price&#13;
contingencies have been calculated for foreign costs, using international annual escalation&#13;
factors of 2.3 percent in 1997, and 2.5 percent in each of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and&#13;
2002. Price contingencies for local costs are based on local annual escalation factors of&#13;
8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent in 1999, and 6.2 percent in each of&#13;
2000, 2001, and 2002.&#13;

/a Expressway civil works contracts in Guangdong include several short sections of interconnecting roads totaling about 2 km in&#13;
the amount of Y 10 million.&#13;
4.45    The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from  detailed&#13;
engineering designs in Hunan and preliminary engineering designs in Guangdong. The&#13;
costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard manuals for labor and equipment&#13;
productivity, the related, annually updated costs, and the current market costs of&#13;
materials, labor, and equipment. The unit rates were checked against the unit prices&#13;
provided in recent bids for similar highway works executed under Bank financing in&#13;
Guangdong and ADB financing in Hunan.&#13;
4.46    The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by&#13;
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Guangzhou&#13;
under the Bank's ongoing highway project and in Changsha under the ongoing ADB&#13;
highway project, spare parts, and related training, if needed, to operate and maintain the&#13;
equipment. The estimated cost of consulting services is based on recent contracts for&#13;
similar services under the Bank's ongoing highway project in Guangdong and under the&#13;
ongoing ADB highway project in Hunan.&#13;
J. FINANCING&#13;
4.47    The Bank loan of $400 million would finance about 35 percent of the total project&#13;
cost or about 93 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government (MOC)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
would provide the equivalent of about $153.8 million (14 percent of the total), while the&#13;
Hunan and Guangdong provincial governments would provide the equivalent of about&#13;
$579 million (51 percent of the total) to meet the remaining costs of the project, including&#13;
contingencies.  MOC's funding would be restricted to the construction of the&#13;
expressways. The details of project financing for Hunan and Guangdong are shown&#13;
below and in Tables 4.3a and 4.3b.&#13;

4.48 The Bank loan, of which $200 million would be for Hunan and $200 million for&#13;
Guangdong, would be at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based, US dollar, single&#13;
currency loans. It would be lent to the Borrower for a maturity of 20 years, including&#13;
5 years of grace. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be made available to Hunan and&#13;
Guangdong Provinces at the same rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower with&#13;
0.75 percent per year commitment fee on the outstanding balance, beginning 60 days&#13;
after loan signing, less any waiver. Agreement was reached with the Borrower at&#13;
negotiations that it shall onlend the proceeds of the loan to Hunan Province and&#13;
Guangdong Province on these terms.  The Hunan and Guangdong provincial&#13;
governments would bear the foreign exchange risks on their portions of the loan. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Government of China and Hunan and Guangdong Provinces have selected LIBOR-based,&#13;
US dollar, single currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of&#13;
the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of&#13;
their liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar&#13;
denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full&#13;
maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-&#13;
year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk.&#13;
K. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.49 Implementing Agencies. In Hunan HPECDC would be the executing agency for&#13;
XLE and its interconnecting roads, including XZH. HPECDC would also be the&#13;
executing agency for LLH. HPCD would be the executing agency for the Highway&#13;
Maintenance Management and the Expressway Commercialization and Corporatization&#13;
studies and the Road Safety Program. In Guangdong, GPFC would be the executing&#13;
agency for XGE and its interconnecting roads. GPFC would also be the executing&#13;
agency for the technical assistance on expressway safety while GPCD would undertake&#13;
the transport and economic integration study.  The PCDs in both provinces have&#13;
submitted project implementation plans (PIPs) for their respective project components&#13;
that the Bank found to be generally satisfactory. These PIPs are available in the Project&#13;
File. The Hunan and Guangdong PIPs were revised and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
4.50  Expressways and Interconnecting Roads. Detailed designs and technical bid&#13;
documents are being completed in both provinces. Foreign experts from Sweden visited&#13;
Hunan Province in July/August 1996, while in Guangdong, the experts from Austria will&#13;
visit during late 1996/early 1997 to review designs and bid documents. Preparation of&#13;
commercial bid documents is being carried out by China International Tendering&#13;
Company (CITC) in Hunan and China Machine International Tendering Company&#13;
(CMCITC) in Guangdong. Pre-qualification documents, for both provinces, were&#13;
released to applicants at the end of March 1996, and the prequalification process was&#13;
completed by August/September 1996. Acquisition of land and the resettlement process&#13;
are expected to be completed by end-1997 in both Hunan and Guangdong. Supply and&#13;
installation of electrical, electronic, and mechanical systems for operation of XLE and&#13;
XGE is scheduled to commence around the end of 1998, and be completed by the end&#13;
2000. The construction of service facilities along XLE and XGE would be a continuous&#13;
process during the project implementation period. XLE and XGE are expected to be&#13;
completed by 2001.&#13;
4.51  Construction Supervision. Construction supervision services for XLE and XGE&#13;
would be carried out by two joint local/foreign supervision teams headed by chief&#13;
supervision engineers headquarters in Hengyang (Hunan) and in Shaoguan (Guangdong).&#13;
There would be a resident engineer for each of the 11 contract sections in Hunan and for&#13;
each of the 10 contract sections in Guangdong. About 169 and 110 local personnel would&#13;
be permanently engaged in supervision during construction in Hunan and Guangdong,&#13;
respectively. Invitations to foreign shortlisted firms were issued separately for the Hunan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
and Guangdong sections in April/May 1996, and the selection of consulting firms is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 1996. The consultants are expected to mobilize&#13;
in early 1997 to help set up the supervision organization in each province prior to the&#13;
commencement of civil works and to provide training within the two provinces and&#13;
abroad to selected local supervision staff. Most of the supervision training is expected to&#13;
be completed by March 1997 in both provinces. Actual construction supervision of XLE&#13;
and XGE is expected to start by April 1997 in both provinces. Construction supervision&#13;
of LLH would be undertaken by local supervision consultants acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.52  Training. Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained would be&#13;
developed by the PCDs in Hunan and Guangdong. Those to be trained abroad would be&#13;
given two-to-three months of intensive English language training, and each trainee would&#13;
be required to submit a report on training received to his/her parent department or agency.&#13;
Moreover, the PCDs of Hunan and Guangdong have indicated that training under the&#13;
project would be related to career development and the professional growth of the&#13;
selected staff. The comprehensive training programs would be open to all highway staff&#13;
in both provinces and would be administered by the two PCDs, in coordination with&#13;
MOC.&#13;
4.53  Equipment.  HPECDC  and GPFC would be responsible for equipment&#13;
procurement related to the central laboratories in Hunan and Guangdong, environmental&#13;
protection, and operation and maintenance of XLE and XGE, respectively. Preparation of&#13;
specifications and bid documents for equipment would be carried out by CITC in Hunan&#13;
and CMCITC in Guangdong. Equipment for the central laboratory and environmental&#13;
protection would be procured during the first year of project implementation while that&#13;
for XLE and XGE operation and maintenance would be procured between 1997 and&#13;
1999.  HPCD would be responsible for the procurement of equipment related to&#13;
maintenance of Hunan's highway network, and to RDB/PMS.&#13;
4.54 Operation and Maintenance of XLE and XGE. Hunan and Guangdong&#13;
Provinces intend to operate the XLE and XGE as toll facilities consistent with their&#13;
designs. HPECDC and GPFC would be responsible for operating and maintaining the&#13;
XLE and XGE, respectively, following their completion. To ensure that the toll rates&#13;
would be appropriately structured and that toll levels would not lead to a substantial&#13;
reduction in the benefits of highway investment, the rationale for setting the level of&#13;
tolling would be determined based on the findings of two studies to be undertaken by the&#13;
two project provinces which would take into consideration latest experience with&#13;
operation of toll roads in Hunan, Guangdong and the rest of China as well as similar&#13;
studies undertaken under Bank-financed highway projects in China. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province and Guangdong Province shall undertake,&#13;
and by December 31, 2000, furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, analyses&#13;
and recommendations for the structure of toll rates on the XLE and XGE, respectively,&#13;
taking into consideration the results of the toll rate structures under Bank-financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
highway projects in China and the recent experience with tolls on high-grade highways&#13;
in Hunan, Guangdong and other parts of China.&#13;
4.55  The project is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2002, with the loan closing&#13;
date stipulated as June 30, 2003. The implementation schedule for the project is&#13;
presented in Annex 5.&#13;
L. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.56  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in Tables 4.4a and&#13;
4.4b which details the procurement arrangements separately for the Guangdong and&#13;
Hunan project parts. A consolidated summary of procurement is shown below. Goods&#13;
and works would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 and revised in January and&#13;
August 1996. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into account the&#13;
experience gained from previous Bank-financed highway projects in China.  The&#13;
procurement documentation, including that for prequalification of contractors,&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for&#13;
civil works, ICB for goods and consultant services has been standardized for Chinese&#13;
conditions in cooperation between the Chinese Government and the Bank. Invitations for&#13;
prequalifications or for bids concerning large, specialized, or important contracts (i.e.,&#13;
contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $ 10 million or more) would be advertised as&#13;
specific procurement notices in the UN Development Business and/or well-known&#13;
technical magazines, newspapers, and trade publications of wide international circulation.&#13;
Standard documents would be used for all relevant procurement processes under the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.57 Works. In Hunan, the civil works for XLE would be divided into 11 contract&#13;
sections, with an average contract size of $32 million equivalent. Electromechanical&#13;
works would be handled as one contract amounting to about $12 million equivalent.&#13;
Interconnecting roads including XZH, administration and maintenance buildings, service&#13;
areas and toll plazas would be carried out in several small contracts. LLH would be&#13;
divided into three contract sections averaging $14 million equivalent. In Guangdong, the&#13;
civil works for XGE would be divided into 10 contract sections for road and structures&#13;
and 3 contract sections for pavements, with an average contract size of $40 million&#13;
equivalent. Electromechanical works would be handled in two contracts, one for traffic&#13;
facilities and one for E&amp;M in tunnels. Administration and maintenance buildings,&#13;
service areas, and toll gates would be carried out in several small contracts. The&#13;
interconnecting roads (several short road sections) would be included in the&#13;
corresponding contract sections for XGE because of the small size of the works involved.&#13;
4.58  The 11 civil works contracts and 1 electromechanical works contract for XLE, the&#13;
13 civil works contracts and 2 electromechanical works contracts for XGE, and the three&#13;
civil works contracts for LLH, with an estimated total cost of about $943 million would&#13;
be procured following ICB procedures. Contracts would be bid on a slice-and-package&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
basis; qualified contractors would be allowed to bid for more than one contract so as to&#13;
attract  international  and  large  Chinese  contractors.    The  three  contracts  for&#13;
electromechanical works would be bid later during the construction of XLE and XGE.&#13;
All bidders for the 24 civil works contracts would be prequalified. Domestic contractors&#13;
competing under ICB procedures would be eligible for a 7.5 percent price preference.&#13;
Domestic bidders are expected to be competitive for all contracts under this project.&#13;

L Expressway civil works contracts in Guangdong include several short sections of interconnecting roads&#13;
totaling about 2 km in the amount of Y 10 million.&#13;
Notes: (1)  Figures in parentheses represent the amounts financed by the Bank Group.&#13;
(2) All figures are rounded and include estimated physical and price contingencies but exclude the&#13;
cost of land acquisition and resettlement which is shown separately.&#13;
4.59   Other works, including interconnecting roads in Hunan and small service facilities&#13;
such as toll stations, maintenance depots, service and rest areas, and administrative&#13;
buildings in Hunan and Guangdong would be awarded following NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. These works would involve contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
$10 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $57.0 million for&#13;
Hunan and $24.6 million for Guangdong. Since these contracts are small in value and&#13;
scattered along XLE and XGE and would be implemented over a four-year period, ICB&#13;
would be neither justified nor practical, but international firms would not be precluded&#13;
from bidding.&#13;
4.60 Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than&#13;
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. However, for equipment where the&#13;
number of suppliers is small, limited international bidding would be followed, in an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding $2 million for each province. All other items or groups&#13;
of items covering minor maintenance equipment, equipment for RDB and PMS,&#13;
laboratories, research and environmental protection purposes estimated to cost less than&#13;
$250,000 per contract package, in an aggregate amount not exceeding $3 million for each&#13;
province, would be procured following international shopping procedures on the basis of&#13;
comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers from at least two&#13;
countries eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufactures&#13;
competing under ICB would be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of&#13;
bids of 15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower.&#13;
4.61  Consultants.  All consultants required for construction supervision (in the&#13;
amount of $23.4 million), staff training ($4.1 million), technical assistance and studies&#13;
($1.7 million) would be selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to&#13;
the Bank in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise&#13;
available in the various provincial universities and institutes in the highway sector would&#13;
be used as much as possible.&#13;
4.62 Advance Contracting. HPCD and GPCD have requested advance contracting&#13;
and retroactive financing in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Consultants for Construction Supervision of XLE and XGE. This&#13;
would allow for training of local staff and startup of construction&#13;
supervision by the time contracts are signed with contractors.  The&#13;
amounts subject to retroactive financing are estimated at $1 million each&#13;
for Hunan and Guangdong.&#13;
(b)   Laboratory Equipment for Joint Local/Foreign Supervision Teams.&#13;
This would permit effective and timely construction supervision. The&#13;
amounts subject to retroactive financing are estimated at $0.2 million each&#13;
in Hunan and Guangdong.&#13;
(c)   Construction of Xiangtan-Leiyang Expressway (XLE). Early start of&#13;
construction of the 2x2-lane, 169-km XLE would help alleviate severe&#13;
traffic bottlenecks and reduce traffic in the heavily trafficked Xiangtan-&#13;
Zhuzhou-Hengyang-Leiyang corridor. The amount subject to retroactive&#13;
financing is estimated at $15 million for Hunan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(d)   Construction of Xiangtan-Zhuzhou Highway (XZH). Early completion&#13;
of this 2x2-lane, 16-km long highway would also help alleviate severe&#13;
traffic bottlenecks and reduce traffic accidents on this heavily trafficked&#13;
road.  The amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at&#13;
$3 million for Hunan.&#13;
4.63  Agreement to the above four requests for advance contracting and retroactive&#13;
financing is recommended, subject to HPCD and GPCD completing all Bank&#13;
requirements, including those for procurement, environment, and resettlement. The total&#13;
amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at about $20.4 million, well below&#13;
the 10 percent limit of the proposed $400 million loan. All of this amount would apply to&#13;
expenditures after June 30, 1996.&#13;
4.64 Bank Review. Prior review procedures would be used for: (a) civil works&#13;
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with&#13;
an estimated value of more than $250,000 per contract, and (c) consulting services with&#13;
an estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals.&#13;
This represents about 83 percent and 78 percent of the estimated value of works and&#13;
equipment contracts, respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-&#13;
review procedures would be followed.&#13;
M. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.65  The proposed Bank loan of $400 million would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
about five years, as shown in the table below. To facilitate disbursements, two Special&#13;
Accounts would be opened, one in Hunan and one in Guangdong, with an authorized&#13;
allocation of $14 million in Hunan and $14 million in Guangdong, the estimated average&#13;
expenditures for a four-month period. The accounts would be opened in US dollars in&#13;
local banks acceptable to the Bank and would be managed by the Hunan and Guangdong&#13;
Provincial Finance Bureaus. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts&#13;
would be submitted monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn down to&#13;
50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.  A schedule of estimated&#13;
disbursements is given in Table 4.5, which takes into consideration the project&#13;
disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the potential risks of delay in&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
4.66 Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done&#13;
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the&#13;
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and estimated at unit rates in&#13;
the contracts would be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision&#13;
teams/units and payments authorized by the Hunan and Guangdong PCDs. Retroactive&#13;
financing of up to $19.2 million in Hunan and $1.2 million in Guangdong (5 percent of&#13;
total loan amount) would be applied to expenditures made after June 30, 1996, for&#13;
consultants for construction supervision of XLE and XGE, laboratory equipment for joint&#13;
local/foreign supervision teams in Hunan and Guangdong, and construction of Xiangtan-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Leiyang expressway and Xiangtan-Zhuzhou highway. Disbursements for staff training in&#13;
China or abroad would be made against the actual costs of travel, subsistence, and tuition&#13;
or training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million equivalent&#13;
or less, training, and contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or less, and&#13;
contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for firns and $50,000&#13;
equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained&#13;
by the implementation agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;

N. AUDITING&#13;
4.67   The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration&#13;
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing the project expenditures. Actual audits would&#13;
be carried out for SAA by the Hunan and Guangdong Branches of SAA or the Hunan and&#13;
Guangdong Provincial Audit Administrations. Assurances were obtained from Hunan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49 -&#13;
Province and Guangdong Province during negotiations that the project accounts and the&#13;
Special Accounts, including SOEs, shall be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the Bank for review within&#13;
six months of the close of each fiscal year. In the case of the SOEs, the audit reports&#13;
would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs submitted&#13;
during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their&#13;
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The Bank Group&#13;
currently accepts SAA audits for this purpose.&#13;
0. PROJECT SUPERVISION, MONITORING, AND REPORTING&#13;
4.68  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose&#13;
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a&#13;
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is&#13;
presented in Annex 6. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at&#13;
headquarters for project-related activities comprising, inter alia, supervision reports,&#13;
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment, and follow-up&#13;
and review of the agreed studies, as well as for efforts related to coordination between the&#13;
two project provinces. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress of implementation of&#13;
all project components through quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the Bank&#13;
independently by HPCD and GPCD on their respective project components. In addition,&#13;
both PCDs would submit to the Bank monthly reports on works progress for XLE, LLH,&#13;
XZH, and XGE. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the project, the&#13;
total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 100 person-weeks.&#13;
4.69  Monitoring.  During implementation, project performance, including the&#13;
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives would be&#13;
monitored by HPCD, HPECDC, GPCD, and GPFC through the use of performance&#13;
indicators, reports on the environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress&#13;
reports and auditing of project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be&#13;
reviewed in an Implementation Completion Report. Annex I presents the outline&#13;
monitoring plan for the project. Each of the project components indices will track annual&#13;
progress in attaining targets during implementation and impact objectives after the project&#13;
is completed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Hunan Province and&#13;
Guangdong Province shall, on the basis of performance indicators acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly report, and by June 30 of each year&#13;
commencing in 1997 and ending three years after completion of the project, an annual&#13;
monitoring report, in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of the&#13;
project and assessing the extent to which different implementation and development&#13;
impact objectives are being attained in the course ofproject execution and operation.&#13;
4.70 Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 1, HPCD and&#13;
GPCD will submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on&#13;
the following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given&#13;
year:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
(a)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports&#13;
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various&#13;
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration&#13;
strategies followed and the number of people rehabilitated (Annexes 4a&#13;
andA4);&#13;
(b)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase&#13;
and the first three years of the operation phase of the XLE, LLH, XZH,&#13;
and XGE (Annex 1);&#13;
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements&#13;
(para. 4.67);&#13;
(d)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities (including highway&#13;
safety) and up-to-date performance indicators (para. 4.69);&#13;
(e)   Reports, by an independent agency/expert, on the completion of the&#13;
Guangdong and Hunan highway safety components within six months of&#13;
the completion of these component; and&#13;
(f)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
5.1   The economic evaluation focuses mainly on the following two segments of the&#13;
Guangdong-Hunan expressway corridor that the Chinese authorities intend to complete&#13;
by the year 2000: (a) Xiangtan-Leiyang segment (168.8 km) in southern Hunan, and&#13;
(b) Xiaotang-Gantang segment (108.7 km) in northern Guangdong. Both segments&#13;
would be financed by the Bank under the proposed NH2 Project and would account for&#13;
over 91 percent of the project base cost. To assess the overall feasibility of the planned&#13;
expressway corridor, the entire Guangzhou-Changsha corridor was also analyzed. The&#13;
corridor comprises the two segments described above plus three other segments, under&#13;
construction or to be financed by other sources, with a total length of 659.0 km.&#13;
Additionally, the construction of Loudi-Lianyuan highway and of Zhuzhou-Xiangtan&#13;
highway in Hunan was also evaluated which both account for 6 percent of the project&#13;
base cost.&#13;
A. EVALUATION OF THE EXPRESSWAYS&#13;
5.2   Benefits and Beneficiaries. The proposed expressway corridor passes through&#13;
the provinces of Hunan and Guangdong. This region now enjoys large economic and&#13;
regional advantages and strategic importance, being the central axis for distribution of&#13;
productive forces, with abundant natural resources and well-developing economies,&#13;
functioning as an important traffic corridor between Beijing and Hong Kong. However,&#13;
as the rapid development of the economy in the region has stimulated a rapid growth of&#13;
increasing numbers of vehicles passing through the region from neighboring cities as well&#13;
as provinces, transportation in this region has become a bottleneck to the development of&#13;
the national economy and society, with, in general, poor transport facilities, saturated&#13;
railway lines, traffic congestion on highways, and the withering of water transport. Thus,&#13;
it is urgent to build an expressway connecting Hunan and Guangdong, and particularly&#13;
the segment between Xiangtan and Leiyang in Hunan, to link up with the south and north&#13;
transportation in Hunan and the segment between Xiaotang and Gantang in Guangdong to&#13;
link up Guangdong Province with the inland provinces.&#13;
5.3   The major quantifiable benefits of the project are the reduction on vehicle&#13;
operating costs and time costs of road users. The expressways will have shorter lengths,&#13;
improved surface conditions and riding comfort, improved geometry, reduced traffic&#13;
interference, and better safety facilities than the existing roads. Therefore, most of the&#13;
long-distance traffic and some of the local traffic is expected to divert from the existing&#13;
roads to the new expressways, reducing the vehicle operating and time costs for the future&#13;
expressways users. Because many users will take the expressways, there will be a&#13;
reduction in the current congestion levels on the existing roads. Thus, traffic that&#13;
continues to use the existing roads will also benefit in the form of time savings due to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
resulting higher travel speeds on the existing roads. Other quantified project benefits are&#13;
due to the traffic that is generated as a result of the lowering of transport costs and which&#13;
previously did not exist on the existing roads or is existing on other transport modes such&#13;
as rail, inland water and air. The newly generated traffic includes traffic resulting from&#13;
increased industrial and agricultural production. Other project benefits that have not been&#13;
quantified are the reduction in accident costs, the generated traffic on the existing roads&#13;
due to the reduction of the current congestion levels, and the positive effects on non-&#13;
motorized traffic that uses the existing roads.&#13;
5.4   The HDM Model. The project benefits described above were estimated using the&#13;
1995 version of the Highways Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM)&#13;
developed by the World Bank as a result of 17 years of research and analysis carried out&#13;
collaboratively by the Bank and major research institutions around the world. The HDM&#13;
model is widely used to analyze the economic consequences of road projects. It predicts,&#13;
for a user-defined set of vehicles and traffic levels, the vehicle operating costs and travel&#13;
time costs on a given roadway as a function of the vehicle characteristics, roadway&#13;
geometry, roadway surface condition (roughness), and congestion level. The model first&#13;
computes the free-flow vehicle speeds as a function of the road and vehicle characteristics&#13;
and, using these speeds, it computes the actual speeds as a function of the congestion&#13;
level. The computed actual speeds are then used to estimate the physical quantities of&#13;
resource consumption (for example, liters/km of fuel consumption or hours of delay) that&#13;
are multiplied by unit costs to finally obtain the road user costs.&#13;
5.5   Data Collection. Data were collected on vehicle fleet characteristics, utilization&#13;
and unit costs, and typical road maintenance operations unit costs. The vehicle and&#13;
maintenance data were collected from Guangdong and Hunan Provinces separately. The&#13;
analysis has shown that the data from the two provinces were similar and could be&#13;
combined to yield a unique and high quality set of vehicle and maintenance data that&#13;
could be used for the economic evaluation for both provinces. Table 5.1 shows the&#13;
resulting vehicle and maintenance input data used in the economic evaluation. The&#13;
average number of passengers for buses is 40 and the average payload is 3 tons for&#13;
medium trucks and 11 tons for heavy trucks. The number of kilometers driven per year is&#13;
65,000 for buses, 50,000 for medium trucks and 75,000 for heavy trucks. The economic&#13;
costs were derived from financial costs by deducting taxes and duties, and the value of&#13;
time was estimated to be Y 1.00/hour calculated on the basis of annual income for the&#13;
region and conservatively assuming that 25 percent of passengers are traveling on work/&#13;
business purposes.&#13;
5.6   Data describing the existing road characteristics and their current traffic were also&#13;
collected in the field. Table 5.2 shows the data collected for each expressway section.&#13;
For the economic evaluation, the two expressway's segments to be financed by the Bank&#13;
were subdivided into three sections, each to take into account different traffic levels,&#13;
design standards and construction costs. The number of expressway sections identified&#13;
and evaluated for the entire corridor between Changsha and Guangzhou is nine. Each&#13;
expressway section captures the traffic currently on a network of existing roads, which is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
represented in the analysis by a representative existing road based on the data collected in&#13;
the field. The expressways would be constructed to four-lane standard with access&#13;
restricted to normal motor traffic; thus, agricultural tractor and nonmotorized traffic&#13;
would be excluded. Due to differences in topography, the average construction cost is&#13;
Y 20 million per km in Hunan and Y 40 million per km in Guangdong. The existing&#13;
roads have an average road width of 12 m in Hunan and 8.5 m in Guangdong; and the&#13;
average gradients are around 3 percent in Hunan and 5 percent in Guangdong. The&#13;
average distance savings will be I0 percent in Hunan and 17 percent in Guangdong.&#13;
5.7   Projected Traffic.  Comprehensive origin-destination (O-D) surveys were&#13;
conducted in the two provinces, covering 43 influence areas in Hunan and 18 in&#13;
Guangdong, that provided a good basis for estimating the diverted and the generated&#13;
traffic. The survey revealed the following: (a) the current average daily traffic (ADT) is&#13;
on average around 10,000 vehicles per day in Hunan and 7,500 vehicles per day in&#13;
Guangdong; (b) trucks constitute about 85 percent of ADT; (c) medium trucks represent&#13;
about 40 percent of ADT and heavy trucks represent 17 percent of ADT; (d) current&#13;
measured vehicle speeds during the most congested hours are about 35 km/hour in Hunan&#13;
and about 15 km/hour in Guangdong; (e) current measured vehicle speeds at night are&#13;
about 55 km/hour in Hunan and 40 km/hour in Guangdong; (f) the expected speeds on the&#13;
expressways are 80 km/hour in Hunan and 70 km/hour in Guangdong; and (g) traffic in&#13;
the peak hour is about 7 to 8 percent of the average daily traffic.&#13;
5.8   On the basis of the O-D surveys, the diversion of traffic from the existing roads&#13;
was estimated to be about 74 percent for Hunan and 55 percent for Guangdong; and the&#13;
generated traffic to be about 3 percent of the current traffic in both provinces. Based on&#13;
the expected economic growth in the area of influence, traffic is projected to increase at&#13;
the following annual rates for the period 1996-2005: 10 percent for cars in both&#13;
provinces, 7 percent for commercial vehicles in Hunan, and 14 percent for commercial&#13;
vehicles in Guangdong. For the period 2006 to 2019, the growth rate is set at 6 percent&#13;
for all vehicles in both provinces.&#13;
5.9   Methodology. For each expressway section, the unit road-user costs, in Yuan per&#13;
vehicle-km, were estimated using the HDM  model for vehicles traveling on the&#13;
expressway and the representative existing road based on the vehicle data shown in Table&#13;
5.1 and on the road data shown in Table 5.2. A sample of these unit costs is given in&#13;
Table 5.3. The road-user costs are a function of the congestion level of a road.&#13;
Therefore, they were computed for a series of traffic levels, and a relationship between&#13;
road-user costs and traffic was established for each road. This relationship was then&#13;
introduced into a customized economic evaluation model created on an Excel&#13;
spreadsheet.&#13;
5.10  The Excel model estimates the benefits due to the diverted and generated traffic&#13;
on the expressways and the remaining traffic on the existing roads. For the diverted&#13;
traffic, the benefits were taken to be the reduction in total transport costs; and for the&#13;
generated traffic, the benefits were taken to be one half of the unit benefits of the diverted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
traffic, assuming the traffic would have developed in proportion to the reduction in&#13;
transport costs. The Excel model takes as inputs the unit road user costs given by HDM&#13;
for the "with" and "without" project cases, the length of the expressway and the existing&#13;
road, the construction and maintenance costs, and the traffic assumptions; and gives as&#13;
outputs the rate of return and the net present value, at a discount rate of 12 percent, of the&#13;
proposed project. The expressways are assumed to be constructed in 4 years, opening to&#13;
traffic in 2000; the economic life of the expressways was assumed to be 20 years (2000-&#13;
2019), and the residual value to be 50 percent of the initial construction cost. Table 5.4&#13;
shows, as an example, the resulting outputs for the Xiaotang-Daqiao section.&#13;
5.11   Results. The following table presents the resulting Economic Internal Rate of&#13;
Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) (at 12 percent discount rate in Y million)&#13;
obtained for each expressway section, each segment to be financed by the Bank, and the&#13;
entire corridor. None of the sections evaluated obtained an EIRR below 12 percent. The&#13;
sections with lower EIRRs are the ones with higher construction costs within each&#13;
province and the section with the highest EIRR, Honghshi-Leiyang in Hunan with 34.2&#13;
percent, is the section with the lowest construction costs and high distance savings of 24&#13;
percent. The EIRR of the segments to be financed by the Bank is 26.3 percent for the&#13;
Hunan segment and 18.1 percent for the Guangdong segment yielding a combined EIRR&#13;
of 22.1 percent. Compared with the segment in Hunan, the segment in Guangdong, has&#13;
higher construction costs, lower traffic, and a lower traffic diversion rate. The EIRR for&#13;
the entire corridor is 19.6 percent. Graphs 5.1 to 5.4 present the diverted traffic to the&#13;
expressway sections in year 2000, the distance savings, the construction costs per&#13;
kilometer, and the resulting EIRR for each section being evaluated.&#13;

5.12   Sensitivity Tests. Table 5.5 presents the results of the sensitivity tests. In the&#13;
first sensitivity case, construction costs are increased by 15 percent; in the second case,&#13;
user benefits are reduced by 15 percent; and in the third case, construction costs are&#13;
increased by 15 percent and user benefits are reduced by 15 percent. The results of the&#13;
third case indicate that both segments financed by the Bank would be economically&#13;
justified even if this pessimistic scenario occurs. The EIRR of the Hunan segment would&#13;
be 22.2 percent, the EIRR of the Guangdong segment would be 15.0 percent and the&#13;
combined EIRR would be 18.6 percent. In this case, the lower EIRR obtained is 11.4&#13;
percent for the Leiyang-Xiaotang section in Hunan.&#13;
5.13   The fourth sensitivity test eliminates the value of time and yields a small&#13;
reduction on the resulting EIRRs.  In this case the combined EIRR for the two&#13;
expressway sections is 20.7 percent and for the entire corridor EIRR is 18.4 percent,&#13;
which confirms the low value of time in China and the low percentage of cars in the&#13;
traffic composition. The fifth sensitivity test eliminates the generated traffic and yields a&#13;
negligible reduction in the resulting EIRRs. In this case the combined EIRR is 21.9&#13;
percent and the entire corridor EIRR is 19.3 percent, which indicates the low percentage&#13;
of generated traffic adopted in the analysis. The final sensitivity test reduces drastically&#13;
the diverted traffic to 50 percent of the estimated values. In this case, the combined EIRR&#13;
for both expressway sections is 15.9 percent and the entire corridor EIRR is 13.6 percent,&#13;
which indicates that the project expressways and the corridor are economically justified&#13;
even under this pessimistic scenario.&#13;
5.14   Risk Analysis. A risk analysis for the Bank financed segments and for the entire&#13;
corridor was undertaken using the @RISK software that adds risk analysis capabilities to&#13;
an Excel spreadsheet following the methodology that is explained briefly in Table 5.6.&#13;
For this analysis, all the input estimates defined in the previous paragraphs were adopted&#13;
and the uncertainty for the following inputs was defined using a triangle distribution:&#13;
(a) the construction costs, (b) the diverted traffic from the existing roads to the&#13;
expressways, (c) the generated traffic, and (d) the traffic growth rate.&#13;
5.15   For the construction costs, the most likely value was set to the estimated&#13;
construction costs, the most likely minimum value was set to be 90 percent of the&#13;
estimated construction costs, and the most likely maximum value was set to be 140&#13;
percent of the estimated construction costs. These assumptions indicate that there is a&#13;
higher probability that the construction costs will be higher rather than lower than the&#13;
estimated value. For the other three traffic related inputs, the most likely value was set&#13;
to the estimated values, the most likely minimum value was set to be 60 percent of the&#13;
estimated values, and the most likely maximum value was set to be 1 10 percent of the&#13;
estimated values. These assumptions indicate that there is a higher probability that the&#13;
traffic related assumptions will be lower rather than higher than the estimated values.&#13;
5.16   With this information, the @RISK software evaluated 400 what-if scenarios,&#13;
varying the construction costs and traffic assumptions accordingly to the defined input&#13;
probability distributions, yielding an estimated EIRR for each what-if scenario. Graphs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
5.5 to 5.10 show the resulting probability distributions for the following cases: (a) the&#13;
input multiplier for the construction costs, (b) the input multiplier for the traffic&#13;
assumptions, (c) the output EIRR for the Bank-financed Majiahe-Leiyang segment in&#13;
Hunan, (d) the output EIRR for the Bank-financed Xiaotang-Gantang segment in&#13;
Guangdong, (e) the output EIRR for both segments financed by the Bank, and (f) the&#13;
output EIRR for the entire corridor. Finally, the following table presents, for the&#13;
segments analyzed with risk analysis, the following: (a) the resulting mean EIRR, (b) the&#13;
EIRR standard deviation, and (c) the probability (in percent) that the EIRR will be lower&#13;
than 12 percent.&#13;
Province         Segment              Mean EIRR    EIRR STD    P&lt;12%&#13;
Hunan            Majiahe-Leiyang         22.7           2.1        0.0&#13;
Guangdong        Xiaotang-Gantang        15.1           1.7        4.2&#13;
Hunan/Guangdong  Majiahe-Leiyang &amp;       18.9           1.9        0.0&#13;
Xiaotang-Gantang&#13;
Hunan/Guangdong  Entire Corridor         16.5           1.8        1.6&#13;
5.17  Conclusion. Both the single point estimation of the Excel model and the risk&#13;
analysis performned by @RISK indicate that the rates of return obtained for the segments&#13;
to be financed by the Bank and for the entire corridor are greater than 12 percent even&#13;
under the most pessimistic scenarios. Therefore, both the project expressways and the&#13;
entire corridor are economically justified.&#13;
B. EVALUATION OF OTHER HIGHWAYS&#13;
5.18 Loudi-Lianyuan. The proposed highway from Loudi to Lianyuan would link&#13;
Loudi city and Lianyuan city in central Hunan, an area that is endowed with abundant&#13;
mineral resources. The Loudi-Lianyuan highway and the Loudi-Xiangxiang highway&#13;
which is under construction will together connect with the provincial capital, Changsha,&#13;
and will become an important east-west transport connection in central Hunan. The&#13;
existing roads that are related to this project have substandard alignment and pavement&#13;
conditions, and carry large traffic volumes leading to serious traffic congestion. The&#13;
proposed highway will be a 58.8-km class II, auto-only road with a design speed of&#13;
80 km/hr and a road width of 2x6 m.&#13;
5.19  It is estimated that the project cost is Y 296 million, the distance saving is 10 km,&#13;
and the traffic on the highway after completion will be 3,700 vehicles per day. The&#13;
traffic on the existing roads at the completion of the highway is estimated to be 500&#13;
vehicles per day and without the highway 3,800 vehicles per day. The resulting&#13;
economic evaluation yields a net present value of Y 200 million and a rate of return of&#13;
20.7 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the rate of return is 18.8, 18.6, and 16.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57-&#13;
percent, respectively, for the following cases: (a) costs are increased by 15 percent,&#13;
(b) user benefits are reduced by 15 percent, and (c) costs are increased by 15 percent and&#13;
user benefits are reduced by 15 percent. Therefore, the highway is economically&#13;
justified.&#13;
5.20 Zhuzhou-Xiangtan. The proposed highway from Zhuzhou to Xiangtan would&#13;
link the two cities and also directly connect with Xiangtan-Leiyang expressway,&#13;
assuming an important role in strengthening highway development in the "Golden&#13;
Triangle" between Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan. The proposed highway will be a&#13;
16.1-km, 2x2 lanes, first-class highway with a design speed of 100 km/hr and a road&#13;
width of 24.5 m.&#13;
5.21  It is estimated that the project cost is Y 101 million, the distance saving is 15 km,&#13;
and the traffic on the highway after completion will be 5,400 vehicles per day. The&#13;
traffic on the existing roads at the completion of the new highway is estimated to be&#13;
1,500 vehicles per day and without the highway 6,600 vehicles per day. The resulting&#13;
economic evaluation yields a net present value of Y 453 million and a rate of return of&#13;
47.0 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the rate of return is 43.4, 42.8, and 39.5&#13;
percent, respectively for the following cases: (a) costs are increased by 15 percent,&#13;
(b) user benefits are reduced by 15 percent, (c) costs are increased by 15 percent and user&#13;
benefits are reduced by 15 percent. Therefore, the highway is economically justified.&#13;
C. OVERALL PROJECT ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
5.22  The overall project, which includes the expressway sections in Hunan and&#13;
Guangdong and the other highways in Hunan, yields a net present value of Y 7,733&#13;
million and a rate of return of 22.4 percent.&#13;

TABLE 5.6: RISK ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY&#13;
Standard spreadsheet models analyses combine single "point" estimates of the model's input variables to&#13;
predict a single result. Estimates of the input variables are used because the actual values are not known with&#13;
certainty. For example:&#13;
Revenues = 100                  Costs = 90                       ==&gt;              Profits = 10&#13;
In reality, however, things don't always turn out as planned because too conservative or optimistic estimates&#13;
may have been adopted. The combined errors in each input variable estimate could lead to real-life result that&#13;
is different from the estimated result. With risk analysis, one can explicitly include the uncertainty present in&#13;
the estimates to generate results that show all possible outcomes. For example, consider a simple case where&#13;
there is uncertainty in both input variables:&#13;
Revenues = 100 or 120           Costs = 90 or 80&#13;
Possible Profits = &gt;             100-90 = 10             100-80 = 20&#13;
120-90 = 30             120-80 = 40&#13;
In a risk analysis, one includes the estimate of an input variable and some measure of the likelihood of&#13;
occurrence for that variable. The risk analysis will then use this information to analyze every possible&#13;
outcome, executing hundreds of what-if scenarios adopting in each case random inputs accordingly to the&#13;
input probability distributions. For example, consider this more complex case:&#13;
Revenues        Estimated most likely value= 100                         (triangle distribution)&#13;
Estimated minimum possible value =90&#13;
Estimated maximum possible value = 130&#13;
Costs           Estimated mean value = 90                                (normal distribution)&#13;

Results: Scenario I             Revenues = 105.9         Costs= 116.8            Profits = -10.9&#13;

A. PERFORMANCE AND MONITORING INDICATORS FOR KEY PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of alleviating infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks of Guangdong and Hunan at which the project is targeted, will be measured&#13;
by reference to a number of monitoring indicators. The specific project objectives and&#13;
the associated monitoring indicators are listed in Table 1. Each indicator will require a&#13;
baseline level against which the effectiveness of the project in achieving the design&#13;
objectives can be measured. The base data would be September 1996, and HPCD and&#13;
GPCD should take the following action to obtain the necessary baseline data and develop&#13;
the necessary methodologies for monitoring. The parameters, baseline and targeted&#13;
values shown in the table are tentatively estimated by the project team; the baseline data!&#13;
methodologies were reviewed and discussed with HPCD and GPCD during the appraisal&#13;
and be finalized during negotiations.&#13;
2.    The achievement of project output will be monitored by monitoring indicators.&#13;
The current monitorable targets are set as shown in Table 2.&#13;
B. MONITORING INDICATORS FOR ENVIRONMENT&#13;
Construction Period&#13;
3.    Environmental Supervision. One of the environmental supervisors in each&#13;
contract section will be assigned or nominated to carry out the supervision of the&#13;
environmental protection measures addressed in the Environmental Action Plans (EAP)&#13;
and integrated in the bid documents. The results will be included in the engineering&#13;
supervision reports and reported periodically to the environmental protection staff at the&#13;
district level. The results of environmental supervision will be annually reported to the&#13;
World Bank through the annual report to the World Bank. The monitoring items will&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   brief description on environmental protection measures supervised/&#13;
inspected during the reporting period; and&#13;
(b)   brief description of problems regarding environmental protection measures&#13;
and their reasons and possible solutions.&#13;

C. MONITORING OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
8.    The monitoring and evaluation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) agreed&#13;
between the Bank and the Borrower will be carried out both internally and externally&#13;
(Annexes 4a and 4b). Internal monitoring will be carried out by the Planning Department&#13;
and the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Department of ROs of HPECDC and GPFC.&#13;
An internal monitoring report will be submitted to the Bank every six months, with the&#13;
first one due on March 31, 1996, and the last one on the completion of the land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement activities. The Academies of Social Sciences of Hunan and&#13;
Guangzhou will conduct the external monitoring of resettlement and will submit a&#13;
monitoring report every six months, with the first one to be submitted by June 30, 1997,&#13;
and the last one at the completion of the project (December 31, 2002).&#13;
9.    The main indicators of land acquisition and resettlement monitoring have been&#13;
identified. They are:&#13;
(a)   Timely payment of compensation to affected entities of various categories;&#13;
(b)   Progress of construction of new houses and quality of construction, also&#13;
distance from old houses&#13;
(c)   Progress in land redistribution;&#13;
(d)   The type of productive use to which compensation amounts have been put&#13;
by the local (township and village) governments;&#13;
(e)   Restoration of production/business activities of affected enterprises.&#13;
Payment of all types of compensation to affected enterprises and workers;&#13;
(f)   Propose linkage of resettlement activities with the project implementation&#13;
schedule (resettlement to be completed at least one month before start of&#13;
construction);&#13;
(g)   Restoration of civic infrastructure at the new sites;&#13;
(h)   Levels of satisfaction of the affected persons;&#13;
(i)   Income levels and standards of living after resettlement.&#13;

ANNEX 3a: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION&#13;
PLAN SUMMARY (HUNAN SECTION)&#13;
1.    Background. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for Xiangtan-Leiyang&#13;
Expressway (XLE) was carried out by the Highway Research Institute of MOC. An EIA&#13;
report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental Assessment (EA)&#13;
Summary were prepared as per the policy and administrative requirements for&#13;
environmental assessment of development projects in China and the Bank's OD 4.01 on&#13;
Environmental Assessment. The development and review of these documents involved&#13;
inputs from various units in the province, the environmental protection bureaus, research&#13;
institutions, universities and the affected groups and NGOs along the highways. These&#13;
documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with the Hunan Provincial&#13;
Communications Department (HPCD) during the preparation mission in April 1995 and&#13;
the preappraisal mission in November 1995. The EIA and EAP for the Loudi-Lianyuan&#13;
Class II Auto-only Highway (LLH), and an EIA report for the Zhuzhou-Xiangtan&#13;
Connecting Road (ZXH), were also reviewed by the Bank during the preappraisal&#13;
mission. The final EIA reports, EAPs and EA Summary covering XLE and its eight&#13;
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH were submitted to the Bank in January 1996 and found&#13;
to be satisfactory to the Bank. A detailed summary of the environmental assessment and&#13;
the action plan is available in the project files.&#13;
2.    Brief Project Description. The main civil component of the Hunan section&#13;
consists of the construction of a 172-km, four-lane expressway between Xiangtan and&#13;
Leiyang (XLE); eight connecting roads to XLE; a 16-km, four-lane Class I highway&#13;
between Zhuzhou Tiantaishan and Xiangtan Yisuhe (ZXH); and a 60-km, two-lane&#13;
Loudi-Lianyuan Class II Auto-only Highway (LLH).  Other components include&#13;
institutional strengthening, training programs, highway safety and construction&#13;
supervision.&#13;
3.    Baseline Environmental Description. The proposed alignment of XLE lies in&#13;
the mid-south of the Hunan Province, whose altitude decreases from the middle to both&#13;
north and south. Twenty percent of the area along XLE is subject to heavy surface soil&#13;
erosion and is becoming more problematic and significant every year. The rivers in the&#13;
region belong to the Xiangjiang drainage system, and have water flows all year round.&#13;
The well-developed surface water system has become the major water source for&#13;
industrial and agricultural production. The area along the proposed road is the most&#13;
developed zone in Hunan Province and an important economic belt which not only serves&#13;
as the major production base for rice, cotton and oil, but also serves as the base for&#13;
metallurgy, building materials, chemistry, textile and food processing industries.&#13;
4.    Because of the past development and dense settlement, the original vegetation has&#13;
been gradually replaced by the present state of scattered secondary forest and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                     ANNEX3a&#13;
nonindigenous vegetation, mainly mason pine, China fir, oil-tea tree and citrus forest.&#13;
Two nature reserves, the Nanyue Natural Protection Zone in Hengshan and the Niaozhou&#13;
Protection Zone (bird sanctuary) in Jiangkou of Hengnan, are both located 23 km and&#13;
6 km, respectively, from the proposed alignment. No rare or endangered animal or plant&#13;
species were found within the 500-m zone on either side of the proposed roads. Lead,&#13;
concentrations in soil samples ranged between 31.6 and 90.3 mg/kg, significantly lower&#13;
than 200 mg/kg value recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture as the criterion for&#13;
acid soil.&#13;
5.    The areas along XLE are rich in tourism resources including scenic spots and&#13;
historical sites such as the Yuelu Mountain Park, the Leiyang Pagoda in Hengyang, the&#13;
Jiangkou Bird Sand-bar Natural Conservancy, etc. During field investigations, three&#13;
potential sites of ancient tombs of Han dynasty were discovered along the alignments.&#13;
6.    Atmospheric monitoring data of the past five years and air quality monitoring at&#13;
14 sites along the alignment of XLE indicate that NO, and CO concentrations meet the&#13;
Class II standards and that TSP (except for two stations) and SO2 (except for one station)&#13;
also meet the Class II standards. The connecting roads and LLH was also monitored and&#13;
found to be acceptable. Daytime and nighttime noise levels at 21 sites along the&#13;
alignment were found to be below the noise standard.&#13;
7.    Potential Environmental Impacts and Their Mitigation Measures. The major&#13;
potential environmental impacts of XLE, its eight connecting roads, LLH and ZXH and&#13;
their mitigation measures are incorporated in their respective Environmental Action Plans&#13;
(EAPs). The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the EIA will be&#13;
dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what institutional&#13;
arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAPs during the three&#13;
distinct phases. The key elements of the EAPs are summarized below.&#13;
Design Phase&#13;
8.    Three alternative alignments were considered in the project design phase of the&#13;
XLE. The final alignments for XLE, LLH and ZXH were selected to minimize land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement costs, potential environmental impacts of the project on&#13;
farmlands, residences, schools, cultural relics, flood control and poor geographical and&#13;
geological conditions. The design includes a number of passageways, overpasses and&#13;
underpasses to facilitate the crossing of the expressway by local people, animals and&#13;
vehicles. To reduce soil erosion, arbor, bush, grass and climbing ivy will be planted in&#13;
the central strip, side slopes and along the road sides. Additional measures such as&#13;
subgrade drainage systems are integrated in the project design, and temporary and&#13;
permanent drainage systems will be constructed to minimize soil erosion and alteration of&#13;
hydrological regimes. Particular attention will be paid to balance cuts and fills, to locate&#13;
borrow areas in waste land, to minimize the use of arable land, and minimize dust and&#13;
noise problems.&#13;
9.    During the initial operating phase, noise levels at several sensitive locations will&#13;
significantly exceed the noise standards used in the initial phase. In later years, as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                     ANNEX 3a&#13;
traffic increases, the noise levels will significantly exceed the standards at many more&#13;
sensitive sites. To mitigate the short and medium term noise problems, a combination of&#13;
measures such as resettlement and installation of noise barriers will be undertaken. In the&#13;
long term (2020), noise monitoring will be continued and appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures will be taken when the noise monitoring results significantly exceed the&#13;
standards. Construction of schools and hospitals will not be allowed within 200 m on&#13;
either sides of XLE, and construction of other buildings, within 50 m of XLE, will be&#13;
prohibited. Up to the year 2020, CO concentration at all sites is expected to meet the&#13;
Class II air quality standards.  In the long term, NOx concentration at Xinting-&#13;
Liugongquiao, Liugongquiao-Hongshi and Hongshi-Guanshi sections will slightly exceed&#13;
the maximum standards while the daily average NO, concentrations will exceed the&#13;
standards at four sections (the three sections mentioned above and the Dashiqiao-Shanpu&#13;
Section), with maximum value 110 percent higher than the standards. Along the eight&#13;
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH, CO and NOx concentrations at all sensitive sites as&#13;
predicted to be within the standard. The long-term air pollution problems caused by&#13;
vehicle exhaust gases will be dealt with by improving vehicle emission controls and&#13;
strengthening vehicle emissions inspection to reduce the exhaust emissions.&#13;
10.   During the cultural relics survey, three ancient tombs, over 2000 years old were&#13;
found in the Yangliu village of Guanshi, Hengnan county. An archaeological salvage and&#13;
protection plan was developed and integrated in the National Highways 2 Project. All the&#13;
salvage activities will be carried out before the start of construction.&#13;
11.   Additional design measures include provisions for adequate drainage, wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities at three service areas, strengthening of crash barriers at pollution&#13;
sensitive locations, and adequate bridge and culvert design to minimize flooding.&#13;
Construction Phase&#13;
12.   To minimize dust during construction, road surfaces, excavation areas, material&#13;
stockpiles, storage areas, and construction sites will be sprayed with water specially near&#13;
towns and villages, water supply sources and near sensitive locations. In particular, coal&#13;
ash will be kept moist with at least 30 percent moisture content. Asphalt and lime stone&#13;
mixing plants will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m&#13;
from residential areas on the leeside of the wind directions. Additional precautions will&#13;
include covering of haul trucks and material storage piles, control of exhaust gas, etc.&#13;
Construction activities within 150 m from residences will be suspended between&#13;
10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., except under exceptional circumstances when a prior written&#13;
approval of the local government and the environmental protection bureau will be&#13;
required.&#13;
13.   Where possible, borrow areas will be restricted to non-forest and non-arable lands,&#13;
and topsoil will be saved and returned to the land. Spoil disposal sites will be carefully&#13;
selected to minimize disruption to the farmlands. Damage to irrigation systems will be&#13;
minimized by construction of temporary channels and conduits and measures will be&#13;
taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted waters and silt from construction activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                     ANNEX 3a&#13;
into rivers and irrigation channels. Construction camp wastes and sewage will be&#13;
collected and treated and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Trees and&#13;
grass will be planted on side slopes, and along the roadside, particularly on sections with&#13;
high fills and deep cuts.&#13;
14.   During construction, effective safety and warning measures will be adopted to&#13;
reduce accidents. This will include, minimization of traffic jams, provision of efficient&#13;
lighting equipment and safety signs, restriction on blasting time and implementation of&#13;
stringent controls at quarries, development of a materials transport plan, etc.&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
15.   During the operation phase, emphasis will be placed on better vehicle&#13;
maintenance and management to promote safety and to minimize vehicle emissions.&#13;
Low-speed, badly maintained old vehicles will be barred from using the expressway.&#13;
Periodic campaigns will be undertaken to educate drivers about the unnecessary use of&#13;
horns, reduction in night time speed, safe transport of hazardous materials, etc. To avoid&#13;
future noise and air pollution problems, construction of residential buildings and schools/&#13;
hospitals will be prohibited within 50 m and 200 m, respectively, from the roadside of&#13;
XLE, and 50 m and 100 m, respectively, from the roadside of LLH and ZXH.&#13;
16.   Environmental Monitoring. During the construction and operation of XLE, its&#13;
connecting roads, LLH and ZXH, environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify&#13;
the actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an&#13;
early stage, and to adjust environmental protection measures as appropriate. Local&#13;
environmental monitoring stations will be responsible for environmental monitoring of&#13;
XLE, its connecting roads and LLH during the construction and operation phases. Motor&#13;
vehicle noise will be monitored by the environmental supervision engineers at&#13;
engineering supervision stations.&#13;
17.   The major items to be monitored during the construction and operation phases&#13;
will include air quality, noise and water quality.  Seven noise level meters, four&#13;
computers to process environmental data, two fire engines, and five ambulances will be&#13;
procured under the project. The detailed monitoring plan is presented in the EAP.&#13;
18.  Institutional Arrangements. The Environmental Protection Office (EPO) in&#13;
HPCD will be responsible for the overall environmental protection and management of&#13;
the highways. The six staff in the EPO will be assisted by the five environmental staff in&#13;
the Environmental Protection Section (EPS) who will be responsible for the&#13;
environmental aspects of the project during the construction phase. Environmental&#13;
monitoring during the construction and the operation phases will be carried out by the&#13;
local environmental monitoring stations through contract with the Xianglei and the&#13;
Loudi-Lianyuan Highway Companies. Environmental training will be undertaken to&#13;
provide adequate training for environmental staff at all levels. The detailed staffing and&#13;
training plan is presented in the EAP.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3b: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ACTION&#13;
PLAN SUMMARY (GUANGDONG SECTION)&#13;
1.    Background. An EIA for Xiaotang-Gantang Expressway (XGE) including its&#13;
connecting roads was carried out by the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute of&#13;
MOC. An EIA report, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and an Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) Summary were prepared as per the policy and administrative&#13;
requirements for environmental assessment of development projects in China and the&#13;
Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. The development and review of these&#13;
documents involved inputs from various units in the province, the environmental&#13;
protection bureaus, research institutions, universities and the affected groups and NGOs&#13;
along the highways. These documents were reviewed by the Bank and discussed with&#13;
Guangdong Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) and Guangdong Provincial&#13;
Freeway Company (GPFC) during the preparation mission in July 1995, and the&#13;
preappraisal mission in November 1995. The final EIA report, EAP and EA Summary&#13;
covering XGE and its interconnecting roads were submitted to the Bank in January 1996&#13;
and found to be satisfactory to the Bank. A detailed summary of the environmental&#13;
assessment and the action plan is available in the project files.&#13;
2.    Brief Project Description. The main civil component of the Guangdong section&#13;
consists of the construction of 110-km, four-lane expressway between Xiaotang and&#13;
Gantang (XGE) and the interconnecting roads of XGE. Other components include&#13;
institutional strengthening, training programs, long-term studies on transport and&#13;
economic integration, technical assistance on expressway safety, and construction&#13;
supervision.&#13;
3.    Baseline Environmental Description. The proposed alignment of XGE starts&#13;
from Xiaotang, on the border with the Hunan province, passes through west Lechang&#13;
mountains area and Ruyuan county, and ends in Guantang in the suburb of Shaoguan&#13;
City. Generally, the terrain slopes from northwest to southeast. The 73-km section&#13;
between Xiaotang and Ruyuan is located in the mountain terrain, while the 37-km section&#13;
between Ruyuan and Gantang is located in the heavy rolling terrain. The area is criss-&#13;
crossed by the Wujian and Nanshui rivers, neither of which is open to navigation.&#13;
4.    Plant resources are abundant and forests cover more than 50 percent of the project&#13;
area. However, over the past 100 years, due to the sharp increase in population, various&#13;
economic activities, etc., forest vegetation has changed from broad-leaved evergreen&#13;
forests to forests with simple tree varieties. As a result, some of the hilly areas have only&#13;
sparse bush slopes or bare rocks, and most fine soil has been washed away. The present&#13;
vegetation along the alignment are mostly cropland and woodland (shrub and manmade&#13;
forests). Thus, only limited wild animals such as hares and pheasants are found along the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-                       ANNEX3b&#13;
alignment. Lead concentrations in soil sampled at seven sites ranged between 34 and&#13;
40 mg/kg, significantly lower than 300 mg/kg value recommended by the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture as the criterion for soil with a pH value of 6.5.&#13;
5.    The area surrounding Shaoguan City is rich in tourist resources. The tomb of&#13;
Yujing, a Minister of Soong Dynasty, is located approximately 300 m from the alignment&#13;
and a field survey identified ancient tombs at two sites along the alignment.&#13;
6.    Atmospheric baseline monitoring of TSP, CO, NOx and lead was carried out for&#13;
five consecutive days, at five sites along the alignment. At all monitoring sites, CO, NO,&#13;
and lead concentrations were much lower than the ambient air quality standards for both&#13;
maximum and daily average values. The maximum TSP concentrations were also below&#13;
the standard but at three sites, daily average TSP concentrations slightly exceeded the&#13;
standards. Of the eight sites monitored for baseline noise, only the Laopinshi town site,&#13;
where the alignment is next to the existing National Highway 107, exceeded the noise&#13;
standard at night.&#13;
7.    Potential Environmental Impacts and Their Mitigation Measures. The major&#13;
potential impacts of the XGE and its linking roads and the associated mitigation measures&#13;
are summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) of XGE&#13;
and its linking roads. The EAP stipulates how the environmental impacts identified in&#13;
the EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what&#13;
institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAP during the&#13;
three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAP are summarized below.&#13;
Design Phase&#13;
8.    Three major alternative alignments were considered at the prefeasibility study and&#13;
the selected route (the Ruyuan route) was further refined during the feasibility stage,&#13;
using factors such as land minimization, impacts of air and noise pollution on&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas, etc. The design includes a number of passageways,&#13;
overpasses and underpasses to facilitate the crossing of the expressway by local people,&#13;
animals and vehicles. To mitigate soil erosion, trees and grass will be planted on median&#13;
divider, side slopes, and along the roadside. Further measures such as slope protection,&#13;
temporary and permanent drainage systems are also incorporated in the design. Particular&#13;
attention was paid to balance the cuts and fills along the XGE, and in selecting quarries&#13;
and borrow sites so as to minimize impact on farmlands and dust and noise problems.&#13;
9.    At 16 environmentally sensitive sites, traffic noise during the operation phase will&#13;
significantly exceed the assessment criteria, particularly in later years. This will be&#13;
mitigated by constructing noise barriers, constructing high fences beside the first row of&#13;
residences and schools, by resettlement and by rezoning the first row of houses as&#13;
warehouses. While CO concentrations at all sites will stay within the assessment criteria,&#13;
in the later years, NO, concentrations at seven out of nine sites will significantly exceed&#13;
the assessment criteria. This will be mitigated by improving vehicle emission controls,&#13;
strengthening vehicle emissions inspection, planting trees, and by prohibiting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-101-                        ANNEX3b&#13;
construction of new residences, schools, hospitals and other sensitive buildings within the&#13;
60-m zone on either sides of the highway.&#13;
10.   Tombs at two sites (K91+700-800, and K105+600-650) will be excavated and the&#13;
information on these sites will be included in the bid documents to ensure that the&#13;
contractors take adequate actions.&#13;
11.   Additional design measures include provisions for adequate drainage, wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities at service areas, strengthening of crash barriers at pollution-sensitive&#13;
locations, adequate bridge and culvert design to minimize flooding, and planting of a&#13;
20-m wide and 200-m long forest belt.&#13;
Construction Phase&#13;
12.   To minimize dust during construction, road surfaces, excavation areas, material&#13;
stockpiles, storage areas, and construction sites will be sprayed with water, especially&#13;
near towns and villages, and near sensitive locations. Asphalt and lime stone mixing&#13;
plants will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m from&#13;
residential areas on the leeside of the wind directions. Additional precautions will&#13;
include covering of haul trucks and material storage piles, control of exhaust gas etc.&#13;
Noisy construction will be prohibited between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., except under&#13;
exceptional circumstances when a prior written approval of the local government and the&#13;
environmental protection bureau will be required. Other measures include, construction&#13;
of noise barriers at sensitive locations, equipping machinery with effective mufflers and&#13;
strengthening equipment maintenance.&#13;
13.   Where possible, borrow areas will be restricted to nonforest and nonarable lands&#13;
and topsoil will be saved and returned to the land. Spoil disposal sites will be carefully&#13;
selected to minimize disruption to the farmlands. Damage to irrigation systems will be&#13;
minimized by construction of temporary channels and conduits and measures will be&#13;
taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted waters and silt from construction activities&#13;
into rivers and irrigation channels. Construction camp wastes and sewage will be&#13;
collected and treated and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.&#13;
14.   During construction, effective safety and warning measures will be adopted to&#13;
reduce accidents. This will include, minimization of traffic jams, provision of efficient&#13;
lighting equipment and safety signs, restriction on blasting time and implementation of&#13;
stringent controls at quarries, development of a materials transport plan, etc.&#13;
Operation Phase&#13;
15.   During the operation phase, emphasis will be placed on better vehicle&#13;
maintenance and management to promote safety and to minimize vehicle emissions. Low&#13;
speed, badly maintained old vehicles will be barred from using the expressway. Periodic&#13;
campaigns will be undertaken to educate drivers about the unnecessary use of horns,&#13;
reduction in night time speed, safe transport of hazardous materials, etc. Construction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-                     ANNEX3b&#13;
permanent buildings within 60 m on either side of the expressway will be actively&#13;
discouraged.&#13;
16.   Environmental Monitoring. During the construction and operation of XGE and&#13;
its interconnecting roads, environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify the&#13;
actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an&#13;
early stage, and to adjust environmental protection measures as appropriate.  The&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Station (EMS) under the Environmental Protection Division&#13;
of GPFC will be mainly responsible for environmental monitoring during the&#13;
construction and operation phases. However, noise and dust will be monitored by the&#13;
environmental supervisors at construction contract sections.&#13;
17.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase will include air&#13;
quality, noise, and water quality. These items will be monitored during the operation&#13;
phase as well. In addition, lead in soil and crops will be monitored during the operation&#13;
phase. Fifteen sets of domestic sound-level meters will be procured under the project.&#13;
The detailed monitoring plan is presented in the EAP.&#13;
18.  Institutional Arrangements: Environmental aspects of the construction of the&#13;
XGE will be managed and promoted by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD). It&#13;
will be headed by a senior level manager in GPFC and will also include full-time&#13;
environmental staff assigned to the XGE Preparation Office. Three Environmental&#13;
Protection Offices will be established and part-time supervisors will be assigned to each&#13;
contract section to carry out environmental supervision and dust and noise monitoring.&#13;
Other monitoring will be carried out by the Environmental Monitoring Station under&#13;
EPD/GPFC. During the operating phase, environmental work will be carried out by an&#13;
Environmental Protection Section with environmental staff, set up in the XGE Company,&#13;
which will operate and maintain the XGE. Environmental training will be undertaken to&#13;
provide adequate training for environmental staff at all levels. The detailed staffing and&#13;
training plan is presented in the EAP.&#13;

3.    Resettlement Action Plans. The PRO of HPECDC prepared two RAPs for the&#13;
project based on the Laws and Regulations of PRC and Hunan Province as well as the&#13;
Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. The main RAP&#13;
covers the Xiangtan-Leiyang expressway including the linkup road between Xiangtan and&#13;
Zhuzhou, the second RAP is presented as an appendix covering the RIP component&#13;
(Loudi-Lianyuan Highway).&#13;
C. POLICY AND STRATEGIES FOR RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.    Legal Framework and Resettlement Policy. In addition to the National laws&#13;
and regulations mentioned in the main text, the following local regulations govern land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement in Hunan Province:&#13;
Provincial Policy:&#13;
* Hunan Provincial Land Administration Implementation Regulations (1992)&#13;
* Hunan Provincial People's Government's Xiangzhenban No. 22 Document&#13;
(1992)&#13;
City Policy:&#13;
* Xiangtan City People's Government's Tan Zhen No. 3 document:&#13;
Regulations on Land for State and Town Construction (1989)&#13;
o Zhuzhou city Land Administration Regulations (1989 and 1993)&#13;
* Hengyang City People's Government's No. 10 document (1991)&#13;
5.    Resettlement Compensation. The average annual output value for land varies as&#13;
much as 24 percent among the counties which are affected. For this project the highest&#13;
average annual output value (Y 1,002/mu) had been selected as a basis for compensation.&#13;
The multipliers selected are 6 for irrigated land, and 3 for resettlement grant, the highest&#13;
multipliers in the Land Law.&#13;
6.    Land Redistribution. Preference will be given to land-based resettlement by&#13;
readjusting the village land among the laborers in the village, to the extent that the&#13;
average land per person in the village does not fall below the township level. Whenever&#13;
the average falls below the township level, then the surplus labor will be resettled in&#13;
enterprise jobs. After the readjustment of land, the PRO, local governments, City ROs&#13;
(CIROs) and County ROs (COROs) will take rehabilitation measures to increase the&#13;
productivity of agricultural land.&#13;
7.    House Relocation.  Compensation for affected buildings will be paid at&#13;
replacement cost (without depreciation). PAPs will be relocated in original villages, near&#13;
their original house.  Construction of new housing will be completed before the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-                       ANNEX4a&#13;
destruction of the affected structures. Vulnerable groups and those who need assistance,&#13;
such as, the old, sick and the handicapped will be assisted by the local authorities while&#13;
they reconstruct their houses. Detailed rates of house compensation is provided in the&#13;
RAP.&#13;
8.    Affected Public Buildings and Enterprises. Affected enterprises will be rebuilt&#13;
and will reemploy all the original workers. Construction of new facilities will be&#13;
completed before old structures are demolished so that production losses are minimized.&#13;
Compensation of lost output, work stoppage allowance and production stoppage&#13;
allowance will be incorporated into the compensation rates for the facilities.&#13;
9.    Transfer of PAPs from Agriculture to Enterprise Jobs. A tota of 1,221 PAPs&#13;
(including all family members) will be transferred from agricultural to enterprise jobs due&#13;
to limitations in land availability. This figure translates into 483 economically active&#13;
laborers. During the waiting period, if any, enterprises will pay the workers a fee of&#13;
Y 200 per month. PAPs will sign employment agreements with the enterprises which&#13;
will provide lifelong employment and pension after retirement.&#13;
10.   Job Creation. To provide jobs for the eligible PAPs, 28 enterprises were chosen&#13;
along the route which are willing to employ the 483 laborers. Currently, these enterprises&#13;
employ between 80 and 210 workers. After resettlement they will be employing between&#13;
5 and 28 additional PAPs each. Over the last three years, the rate of growth of&#13;
employment in these enterprises was between 10 percent and 22 percent, and the rate of&#13;
growth of output has surpassed the employment growth. This record provides a favorable&#13;
indication on their future performance. It is predicted that the PAPs' income will&#13;
increase as a consequence of enterprise employment. Employment environment in these&#13;
enterprises has been screened to ensure that it will not cause employment related health&#13;
problems.&#13;
11.   Infrastructure. Affected infrastructure will be rehabilitated either by the project,&#13;
or compensation will be paid, at replacement cost, to the owners of infrastructure.&#13;
Improvement of the standards of affected infrastructure will be ensured through&#13;
consultation with the PAPs during the rehabilitation of the infrastructure.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONS&#13;
12.   Institutional Responsibility. Leading groups at the project, city and county&#13;
levels have been established with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing&#13;
resettlement. Actual implementation of resettlement will be under the responsibility of&#13;
CIROs and COROs. These offices have been equipped with the necessary staff and&#13;
equipment. The responsibility of the ROs at all levels are to distribute compensation,&#13;
guarantee the implementation of the RAP, and assist the PAPs to improve their standards&#13;
of living. COROs have assigned members from the local government, communications,&#13;
land acquisition, water conservancy, post and telecommunications bureaus to staff their&#13;
offices. TROs have followed the same procedure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106 -                       ANNEX4a&#13;
13.   Staffing of the ROs. PRO has seven staff members including the Director. Five&#13;
COROs have a total of 34 staff members and 29 TROs have a total of 97 staff members.&#13;
The monitoring data base that the village ROs and TROs will utilize is also available at&#13;
the CIRO, CORO and PRO level in electronic form. Monitoring results will flow to&#13;
COROs, where the information will be processed in electronic form and transmitted to&#13;
PRO to complete the monitoring cycle.&#13;
E. SCHEDULING&#13;
14.   Implementation Schedule. Preparation of the RAP has begun in January 1995&#13;
with the establishment of the PRO. The census survey, consultation with PAPs,&#13;
establishment of local ROs, and consultation on compensation rates and rehabilitation&#13;
packages have already taken place. The schedule for the remaining activities associated&#13;
with the implementation of the RAP is presented in Table 2.&#13;

G. GRIEVANCE, PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION&#13;
16.   Grievance Process. PAPs with grievances on the process of resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation shall consult with the village resettlement offices and TROs. If the results&#13;
are not satisfactory to the PAPs, they can submit their complaint in written form to the&#13;
CORO. The county will respond to the complaint within 15 days. If the issue is not&#13;
resolved, an appeal should be made to the PRO which will respond in 15 days. If the&#13;
issue cannot be resolved within by the project authorities, then grievance will be brought&#13;
to the people's court according to 38th article of PRC Administration Lawsuit Law.&#13;
17.   Participation and Consultation. PAPs have been consulted on the impact of the&#13;
project and resettlement measures since January 1995 through surveys, public meetings,&#13;
consultation on compensation rates and the selection of resettlement sites.  As a&#13;
consequence of the participation process, the house compensation rate has been increased&#13;
to the present level as it was suggested by the PAPs. The PAPs were informed about the&#13;
project and already know the location of their new land and house-plots. Consultation&#13;
with the PAPs will continue during implementation.&#13;
H. MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
18.   Internal Monitoring. PRO is responsible for the organization and execution of&#13;
internal monitoring of the resettlement associated with the project. All levels of ROs will&#13;
coordinate their monitoring activities. During implementation, TROs and COROs will&#13;
record their resettlement and rehabilitation activities at the individual and household level&#13;
into their databases and transmit the information to the PRO.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                     ANNEX4a&#13;
19.  Independent Monitoring. The implementation of the RAP will be monitored by&#13;
an independent agency to evaluate its progress and the compliance of the implementing&#13;
organizations with the principles of the RAP. In addition, the agency will conduct&#13;
surveys to monitor the Standards of Living of the PAPs to ascertain that remedial action&#13;
will be taken if the living standards fall below preproject levels. HASS will also be&#13;
responsible to monitor the: (a) coordination between the schedule of resettlement and&#13;
civil works; (b) grievance issues; (c) job creation; (d) rehabilitation of infrastructure; (e)&#13;
satisfaction of the PAPs.&#13;

3.    Resettlement Action Plan. RO of GPFC prepared the RAP for the project based&#13;
on the laws and regulations of PRC and the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.30 on&#13;
Involuntary Resettlement. SHSDI, Expressway Construction Command Office (ECCO)&#13;
of affected cities and counties and local Land Acquisition Offices (LAOs) collaborated&#13;
with the RO during the preparation of the document. Guangzhou Academy of Social&#13;
Sciences (GASS) provided consulting services for population surveys. The RAP forms&#13;
the basis of implementation of land acquisition and resettlement of the project.&#13;
C. POLICY AND STRATEGIES FOR RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.    Legal Framework and Resettlement Policy. In addition to the National laws&#13;
and regulations mentioned in the main text, the following local regulations govern land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement in Guangdong Province:&#13;
Provincial Policy:&#13;
*  Interim Methods of Land Acquisition for Communication Infrastructure of&#13;
Guangdong Province (1992);&#13;
*  Administrative Methods of Forest Land of Guangdong Province (1992)&#13;
&#149;  Interim Regulations Development and Administration for Mine Sources of&#13;
Guangdong Province (1986);&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-111-                        ANNEX4b&#13;
5.    Resettlement Compensation.  Compensation for agricultural land, and for&#13;
structures fall within the range applied in Bank projects. The multipliers for paddy field&#13;
is 4; dry land, vegetable field, orchard and fish pond is 3; and, woodland and bamboo is&#13;
6. Multipliers for young crop compensation is 1/2 for paddy and dry land; 1/3 for&#13;
vegetable land; and, 1 for pond, orchard, woodland and bamboo. As some of the&#13;
multipliers were low, the Calculated Average Annual Output Value of agricultural land&#13;
was adjusted upwards to yield total compensation amounts (per mu) which would be&#13;
comparable to the figures applied in the Hunan section of the project.&#13;
6.    Land Redistribution. Preference will be given to land-based resettlement by&#13;
readjusting the village land among the laborers in the village, to the extent that average&#13;
land per person in the village does not fall below the minimum level. Whenever the&#13;
average falls below the minimum, then the surplus labor will be resettled in enterprise&#13;
jobs. After the readjustment of land, the RO, local governments, and city and county&#13;
ROs will take rehabilitation measures to increase the productivity of agricultural land.&#13;
7.    House Relocation. PAPs will be relocated in their original villages, near their&#13;
original house. Construction of new housing will be completed before the destruction of&#13;
the affected structures. Vulnerable groups and those who need assistance, such as, the&#13;
old, sick and the handicapped will be assisted by the local authorities during the&#13;
reconstruction of their house.&#13;
8.    Affected Enterprises. The project will affect 14 enterprises employing 354&#13;
employees. These enterprises will be compensated and rehabilitated according to the&#13;
following principles: (a) they will be rebuilt, and will reemploy original workers at their&#13;
former salaries; (b) construction of new facilities will be completed within three months&#13;
after the signing of the contract to ensure the normal resumption of business; and&#13;
(c) compensation of lost output, work stoppage allowance and production stoppage&#13;
allowance will be paid to the enterprises.&#13;
9.    Transfer of Surplus Labor in Agriculture to Enterprise Jobs. A total of 3,106&#13;
agricultural laborers will lose some of their land allocation. After land readjustment, only&#13;
2,156 will be able to continue with their agricultural occupation due to the scarcity of&#13;
agricultural land.  The remaining 950 surplus laborers, will either be allocated&#13;
nonagricultural jobs in 15 designated township or county level enterprises, or chose to&#13;
receive the resettlement grant to find their own employment.&#13;
10.   Job Creation. 331 surplus laborers will receive a minimum wage of Y 300/&#13;
month (at about the twice the rate of earning from cultivation) in the designated&#13;
enterprises. During the training period the PAPs will receive a minimum salary of Y 150.&#13;
Details of the enterprises are provided in the county level RAPs. A total of 619 laborers&#13;
chose to find work on their own, in activities such as reclaiming deserted land, cultivating&#13;
fruit trees on the slopes, and working independently in the service sector. The township&#13;
and village authorities will assist these PAPs in finding new job opportunities by&#13;
providing credit and technical advice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112 -                     ANNEX4b&#13;
11.   Affected National Minorities. The project passes through Ruyuan county where&#13;
the Yao minority is concentrated. During the design of the highway, a special effort was&#13;
made to minimize the impact on the Yao, but, due to the difficulty of the terrain, 1,351&#13;
Yao will still be affected, where 121 families will lose their houses. GPFC will provide&#13;
rehabilitation benefits to the Yao community beyond the compensation of lost assets.&#13;
12.   Infrastructure. Compensation for infrastructure has been agreed between GPFC&#13;
and the owners of the infrastructures. Compensation will be paid by GPFC and the&#13;
owners will be responsible for the rehabilitation of the affected infrastructure.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONS&#13;
13.   Institutional Responsibility. Leading groups at the project, city and county&#13;
levels have been established with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing&#13;
resettlement. Actual implementation of land acquisition will be under the responsibility&#13;
of county and township ROs. Expressway Construction and Command of Shaoguan City&#13;
(ECCSC) will be responsible for the signing of contracts and supervising the&#13;
implementation of the RAP. GPFC has set up three Resettlement Offices On the Spot&#13;
(ROOS) in Qujiang, Ruyuan, and Pingshi, to work as the field office of the RO of GPFC&#13;
and to conduct internal monitoring.&#13;
14.   Staffing of the ROs. RO of GPFC has 10 staff members. ECCSC has four&#13;
sections (secretariat, land acquisition, engineering and finance), employing 16 staff&#13;
members. ROOS will have three staff members each. County and Township ROs have&#13;
at least two staff members each.&#13;
E. SCHEDULING&#13;
15.   Implementation Schedule. RO of GPFC was established in May 1995. In June&#13;
1995, SHSDI was given the task of conducting the census of the PAPs and their assets,&#13;
and GASS was appointed as the advisor for population surveys. The census was&#13;
conducted between August-September, and November 1995. The RAP was prepared in&#13;
collaboration with GASS, SHSDI and local ROs . The schedule for the remaining&#13;
activities associated with the implementation of the RAP is presented in Table 2.&#13;
