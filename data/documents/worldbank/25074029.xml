&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . above the table; nothing is under the table.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Nothing. [Laughter] Can't be with it.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: That was in â&#128;&#152;68, â&#128;&#153;68, and he was one of the young economists at&#13;
that moment I recruited. He is now director of the bureau of international relations in the&#13;
ministry of public works, so he knows also about this history. [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, we're very interested to hear about what you people think of the Bank as&#13;
a project lender. We know that there's a great policy dialogue going on between&#13;
Professor Widjojo [Nitisastro] and his colleagues and the Bank, but the Bank does do&#13;
this, mostly what the--the money is mostly project money, and it's very important that it&#13;
be done well, I suppose. Do you have any particular impressions about how the Bank&#13;
does this?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Policy? Policies of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Project. Project work. You went on a delegation in â&#128;&#152;68 to negotiate a project?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, I was chairman of the delegation of five. One of the&#13;
members was Saleh Afiff, who is now head of the group, of BAPPENAS [Badan&#13;
Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National Development Planning Board] , the&#13;
national development board. He was one of the members, and I was the chairman there&#13;
to negotiate this IDA [International Development Association] loan, soft loan, in â&#128;&#152;68 as a&#13;
start. After that, well, irrigation projects got big amounts, very big amounts, in the&#13;
framework of supporting the food production, increase of food production, especially&#13;
rice. So it was one of the factors, I think, that in â&#128;&#152;84 the Indonesian government become&#13;
self-sufficient in rice after, well, one of the first, one of the biggest importer of riceâ&#128;&#148;was&#13;
it 85 million or so tons?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Depends on one third of the . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The biggest importer of rice, but in â&#128;&#152;84 we got in self-sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The first loan was for irrigation?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: For irrigation, for projects, rehabilitation of irrigation&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Why was the first loan irrigation? Whose idea was that?&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Becauseâ&#128;&#148;of the government because one, highest priority, was&#13;
increase of rice production.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So you wanted that, and the Bank [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And talking about rice, Indonesia everywhere is irrigated rice&#13;
fields. So irrigation--like you have an increase of production projected for rice, then&#13;
irrigation is a must. So that's why we start with the infrastructure and with this irrigation&#13;
because it was in the bad shape after the revolution and after the [inaudible] time,&#13;
existing irrigation from the Dutch colonial time was in bad shape. So the first priority was&#13;
rehabilitation of existing irrigation networks, and that was the first loan.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Who made the decision on that here? Was that the planning--there wasn't a&#13;
planning office then.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yes. Widjojo was already head.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: '68 already?&#13;
&#13;
[Discussion of coffee]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yes. The government, the president has decided this.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did the president himself decide . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Thinking increase of rice production as first [inaudible] yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell was just arrived?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Bell was here, Bernie Bell.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You talked about it with him, I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Not yet. In â&#128;&#153;68 there was no World Bank . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, he came in â&#128;&#153;68.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . office yet. [both talking]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What time in '68 was this, then? [Robert S.] McNamara came in June of â&#128;&#152;68.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: June â&#128;&#153;68.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And you didn't have any office before that I know of.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: I don't think, because he has an office already. Maybe a manâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Bernie Bell maybe was here already.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, he was going to establish the office.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah. [both talking]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I don't think he would have--you didnâ&#128;&#153;t have anyâ&#128;&#148;you weren't a member of&#13;
the Bank at that point, I guess. You had resigned from the Bank and the [International&#13;
Monetary] Fund back in the Sukarno period, and then you came back in with the Fund&#13;
maybe â&#128;&#152;67 or something like that, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m just curious . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It was the first [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The first, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: We can settle those dates.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The World Bank has had an office . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, I'm just curious about whether the . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . three years already out of--Iâ&#128;&#153;m not clear anymore about that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, I'm just curious about whether the contact, eventually the discussion with&#13;
the Bank was with a resident here or whether you went straight to Washington and then&#13;
you probably dealt with the agriculture . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: I think it was a talk between Widjojo and Bernie Bell.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think so, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It was a consultation, because Widjojo himself has asked me to&#13;
go to Washington. He has personally asked me to go to Washington because there would&#13;
be an irrigation project as a start within the policy of rice preservation, increase rice&#13;
production, because rice production was already the top priority in the country&#13;
[inaudible] at that time.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And this project was the beginning of a long series of irrigation projects.&#13;
Were there any discussions on the mode of irrigation, whether it should be large projects&#13;
or many small projects?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: First was rehabilitation. Existing . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of existing systems.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Existing systems.&#13;
&#13;
[Discussion of refreshments]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: So rehabilitation of existing irrigation networks was the first&#13;
priority. But if you talk about rehabilitation only, it means there might be only or would&#13;
be only Java and a small part in southern part of Sulawesi. So while we would like to,&#13;
also to increase the rice production in other islands, so the next--not with the first five&#13;
million dollars, but the next one, I have also asked to be assisted in studies and design of&#13;
new irrigation networks, so that means not only . .&#13;
&#13;
[Discussion of refreshments]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And of course concentrating on small and medium-size.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And mainly canal irrigation? Or was it wells?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Only the canal, only the canal system. Afterwards also with&#13;
wells, afterwards, but the first stop was gravity irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And was that--but the ideas about the sequencing, whether it should be rehab&#13;
first and then, as well as whether it should be gravity irrigation or wells, how much of&#13;
those were, came from here and how much of that sort of came from the Bank's ideas?&#13;
Or was it sort of . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: In my opinion the ideas came from us. At least in my time--I&#13;
was sixteen years director general of water resources and then afterwards one year as&#13;
secretary general and after that five years as minister--so in the beginning of the period of&#13;
course I would talk about water resources normally first, afterwards also about roads and&#13;
urban. So at that time all I just gave as written proposals. At first we would like, first of&#13;
all, of course, rehabilitation existing wells, but politically spoken we are talking about&#13;
rehabilitation only. There will be part only of the--also I am a native from Java, but I&#13;
think politically we have also to start with other islands if we would like to increase the&#13;
national production of rice. So we start surveying and then designing also irrigation&#13;
network for other . . .&#13;
&#13;
Also the World Bank was not so enthusiastic; it would like to rehabilitate those existing&#13;
[inaudible] It was understandable because the IRR [internal rate of return] , the benefit&#13;
ratio and so is of course higher if it is rehabilitation. Being a Bank, also, as a&#13;
development bank, they would like to have this first and concentrating first on small and&#13;
medium size.&#13;
&#13;
Afterwards, I think starting in â&#128;&#152;75 or â&#128;&#152;76, we also start to rehabilitate and increase and&#13;
improved an existing large irrigation of 200,000 hectares nearly, near to Jakarta, in West&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Java. It is called the Jatiluhur area. Then of course, why, we start also with a big&#13;
irrigation scheme because that is the hinterland of Jakarta. It's not far from here, very&#13;
fertile land. For that we had also the assistance of World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is that irrigation for paddy for rice?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Rice, number one rice, but now we are at this moment we are at&#13;
the stage where soybeans and other crops, [both speaking at once] vegetables, onions,&#13;
also, but at that moment . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At that time it was rice.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . it was rice, rice, rice, because here in Indonesia, people, if they&#13;
have bread as breakfast, they still have, â&#128;&#156;Well, I don't have my breakfast yet.â&#128;&#157; It's the&#13;
same. It always is rice, rice, rice or three times rice a day. At that moment, two days or&#13;
more, sometimes no breakfast or even very little lunch--but now I think it is improving.&#13;
The people are eating two times rice, except people in the city here in business who are in&#13;
a hurry eating breakfast. In general the people, if they have . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bread is quicker, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . bread as breakfast they still have, â&#128;&#156;I don't have my breakfast&#13;
yetâ&#128;&#157; because this is rice, rice, rice. Because rice is not just a commodity for Indonesia;&#13;
it's not just a commodity. It has some relation with tradition, relation with religion and so&#13;
on. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You negotiated with the members of the agriculture department?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, of course, because we are only a supporting&#13;
element. And the real one who is in charge of the production is the people from the&#13;
ministry of agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But in Washington . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: We are the only one in Southeast Asia where the irrigation&#13;
service is not in the ministry of agriculture. In Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia,&#13;
Japan, Taiwan, Korea, the irrigation service, the irrigation agency is under the minister of&#13;
agriculture. In India, Indonesia--I think also in India--rice irrigation is not in the ministry&#13;
of agriculture, but [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Where the power is.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: . . we consider it as infrastructure in the ministry of public&#13;
works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                             November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, in India it used to be irrigation and power, and you had to have&#13;
negotiations, diplomatic missions from the agriculture ministry to the irrigation ministry.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: So it is an important case, of course. Here it is under the&#13;
minister of public works, but we work very closely with the other ministry.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You do?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah. It is a must; we cannot do [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But when you went back to negotiate that loan at the Bank, you dealt with their&#13;
projects, agricultural projects people, I guess. Is that right? Is that who you negotiated&#13;
with?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Well, it was also people who--they called it theâ&#128;&#148;I think it was&#13;
an irrigation section or something.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Irrigation unit, I think, would be within agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It was a man from, this man who had served for a long time in&#13;
Malaysia, in irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
And we started in East Java also with using our--developing groundwater, developing&#13;
groundwater, deep wells for agriculture because itâ&#128;&#153;s serving basis. There is not enough&#13;
surface water in the dry season where the farmers are not [inaudible] higher stage of&#13;
development. The paddy fields are there already. People are used to rice cultivation but&#13;
there was a lack of water in the dry season, so that was also we develop groundwater.&#13;
&#13;
And now I donâ&#128;&#153;t know--I am three years already out of this ministry--but I think they are&#13;
now also concentrating on operations and maintenance, assisting operation and&#13;
maintenance, not only irrigation but also the operations and maintenance, assisted by the&#13;
World Bank and ADB [Asian Development Bank] also.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did you at that time or when is the first time you can recollect that the Bank&#13;
began to bring up issues of cost recovery? Was that ever an issue?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Cost recovery? I was always against cost recovery, always a big&#13;
fight in the negotiations, certainly for cost recovery, maybe for a fund which--I called it&#13;
contribution for OMM [operations and maintenance monitoring] . That might be all&#13;
right, but cost recovery? No. Why? Because these farmers are very poor farmers. In&#13;
Java and Bali the land ownership is only .25 hectare, .25. So how can they pay the&#13;
recovery? I told them also, the World Bank, â&#128;&#156;Please name a country where there is no&#13;
subsidy on agricultures.â&#128;&#157; Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no, not any one. I think there is no country where there&#13;
is no subsidy on agriculture sector, small or big but it was always there, a factor of&#13;
subsidy, in the States, in Japan, in Europe. Why should these poor farmers have to pay a&#13;
recovery cost on capital? I was against, always. It was always a big fight. I understand&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the position of World Bank being a bank, but I told them, also, â&#128;&#156;You are not just an&#13;
ordinary bank. You are a development bank. You cannot ask recovery from the capital&#13;
costs with these poor small farmers where .25 hectares is the average.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How about the big farmers? What was the distribution of holdings? Was it&#13;
very unequal?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The average in Java and Bali, the average is .25, so you had one&#13;
is .1, .3, but they are also .1, yes. The average, that is the average. There are smaller.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So there weren't very many people, say, of ten hectares.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, no, no, no. One hectare, two hectare is the biggest.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Big farmers?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s big farmers. That is a rich man in the village. Outside,&#13;
yes. Maybe in Sumatra they have 5 hectares already, Kalimantan, but as you know these&#13;
other islands are not so fertile as in Java and Bali. The land ownership is a [inaudible]&#13;
like in the transmigration area there is [inaudible] 2 hectares per household.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But you--for a long time you won the arguments.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who were you arguing with? People in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The people in the Bank when we had negotiation there in&#13;
Washington.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In Washington? More than here?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Here first, and then people said, â&#128;&#156;You negotiate in Washington.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
The World Bank people said, â&#128;&#156;You negotiate; then we will pursue that.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you remember some of the people that you were . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No. Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The irrigation people understand but the cost of finance men . . .&#13;
And people thought an OMM contribution had to include a certain notes that in the land&#13;
tax, the land tax there is included already the factor of water from the user for OMM. So&#13;
that was also included.&#13;

LEWIS: Do you have an effective . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And they ask, they ask, then, â&#128;&#156;From where you will,â&#128;&#157; because&#13;
the OMM is--have to be made available, either whether it is from the beneficiaries, from&#13;
the farmers or from--so government should pay and from where, what is the source of&#13;
government? At that moment oil, but then the oil price, they fall, went down, so and&#13;
there was not enough, and then we negotiate again. Then I was not in the representative&#13;
bodyâ&#128;&#153;s office anymore; I was minister. Then we negotiate again, but in one or another&#13;
way there should be a contribution of the farmers, and we agreed for OMM, and this stay&#13;
up â&#128;&#152;til now. So thereâ&#128;&#153;s assistance . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was there effective taxation on farmers?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Land tax.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Land tax? Was it collected?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It was understood. It was understood by them because in the&#13;
colonial tax time theyâ&#128;&#153;ve paid also land tax, but for water never. So politically it was also&#13;
difficult to implement because they said, â&#128;&#156;Why? In colonial time we have not paid this&#13;
water here. For land, yes, we have to pay, but not this water.â&#128;&#157; And now [both speaking&#13;
at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was the rate on land--you couldn't raise the rate on land?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You could not? You couldn't raise it?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: You could, of course. That depends on the productivity of the&#13;
land, and if it is an irrigated rice field, the tax is also higher, so that means the water&#13;
factor is there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Some of that for the water for irrigation?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, yeah, but through land tax, not through water tax.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, all right. I understand.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: That would be used for [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did the Bank agree to that, that you could . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah. It was a note, as I told you, a note in the agreement.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In the agreement, the covenant, is that right?&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And the land tax is included.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand that. I see.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: A further study will be done always so many times . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Further study will be done.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And indeed studies were done, and at the time that the oil price&#13;
went down, so there was a study on the possibility of the farmers to--were capable or not&#13;
to pay â&#128;&#156;irrigation service fee,â&#128;&#157; as it's called originally, not â&#128;&#156;water tax.â&#128;&#157; Why? Because in&#13;
our constitution itâ&#128;&#153;s stated that water is a gift of God, so you cannot tax the water. So we&#13;
agreed on the term â&#128;&#156;irrigation service fee.â&#128;&#157; And there was a study, and they have done&#13;
two pilot projects, yeah, in [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Or three.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Or three. Iâ&#128;&#153;m out of date already. The development is so fast in&#13;
three years. Three pilot projects, yeah, to come to collect irrigation service fee besides&#13;
the land tax, the irrigation service fee from the farmers, from the villages.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And in this argument which you apparently have resolved fairly successfully&#13;
with the Bank, what was the position of--you know, there's this group that's called the (I&#13;
guess) economic technocrats, Professor Widjojo's group--were they supporting you, or&#13;
did they sort of stand . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: You mean on the Indonesian side?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They did.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah. When I told them, even in the group, â&#128;&#156;It will be difficult&#13;
to implement because even in the colonial time they got this irrigation and this water is&#13;
free. Water was free. There was no fee on irrigation. And now in this independent&#13;
country you have to pay for this, so they will not understand. So even if we formulate a&#13;
law, it will be difficult to implement. So we have to prepare it step by step.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But essentially, other than these pilot projects, there is no Bank assisted&#13;
irrigation projects.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Study, yes, but implementation only, no, see, even now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And that was a pilot.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Pilot, not nationwide.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Pilot, yes, but there is, of course, a nationwide adopted policy&#13;
from the government that it's now possible, seen from the government, to implement the&#13;
constitution of irrigation service fees from the beneficiaries. But this implementation is&#13;
still through pilot projects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see. Were you also involved in urban water deliveries?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And has . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Urban is not in the directorate of water resources. It's in a&#13;
different, another directorate of urban development, we call it. I was involved when I&#13;
was minister in that [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the issue of cost recovery for water delivery to urban . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Urban delivery of water is no problem because they understand it&#13;
is pipe water, so because it's not just a ditch but a pipe, â&#128;&#156;Oh, you have to pay for this.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Whether this is from steel, iron, or from PVC plastic, but this is something which has to&#13;
be bought, so they understand, and in the Dutch time also for pipe water especially you&#13;
have to pay. There is no problem with that. So we look at the convenience of having a&#13;
tap, you see, because if there is a well, have to work like this, or if there is a farm, but not&#13;
if it is tap water, they understand. There is no problem at all on pipe water contributions&#13;
in urban areas. And there is now at this moment a big, a very big project here, I mean the&#13;
scope is very big, assistance on urban water, urban drinking water nationwide.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So from that issue there was no difference . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No difference at all.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Has the Bank been helpful, knowledgeable in the urban development area?&#13;
Does it have good ideas or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah. [all speaking at once] In the greatest--well, I think they&#13;
understand the situation but also this context, because the loan should always go through&#13;
the central government, but the implementation is by the local governments, especially in&#13;
the case of urban, the cities, integrated urban projects. So, and sometimes there are&#13;
misunderstandings in the implementation, but I think both the--we in the Indonesian part,&#13;
especially the urban part, have learned from experience and now, even as I said, there is a&#13;
big program on that, on the urban integrated development, that means . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                             November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Urban infrastructure . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Urban infrastructure, [inaudible] roads, urban roads, drainage,&#13;
drinking water, flood controls.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank is supporting that, that kind of integrated project?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a new kind of thing or . . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Start in 1989 with a small [inaudible] project.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The sector was not integrated before this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: As you may know, the integrated rural development has had a kind of a--in&#13;
parts of the world a rather bad history simply because it's been too complex to really fit&#13;
all the pieces together. In Africa, for example, the Bank has had rather discouraging&#13;
experience, really, with integrated projects. Integrated urban development . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It's more complex than integrated rural.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I suppose it is more complex.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: More complex than integrated rural, yeah. Why? Because not&#13;
only on the government side but also the World Bank side--also in the ADB--the&#13;
structure of negotiations is not integrated but sectoral. So like we get the minister of&#13;
agriculture, minister of public works, minister of home affairs: so it's not a regional&#13;
integrated approach in implementation. Yes, in the formulation of the program it is&#13;
integrated, but in the implementation it is through the sectors.&#13;
&#13;
But it is the same with the World Bank, that the requirement of the division of irrigation,&#13;
division of roads, division of [inaudible] proper agriculture, proper--so in the&#13;
implementation it is also . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They've been trying to solve that, you know. They do have now regional&#13;
organizations that are supposed to be dominant.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, in the higher levels.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But not at the working level.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Not at the implementation level, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, and they change&#13;
every five years to . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, they do. They fool around with the organization chart, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: But there is a tendency now--I hope I'm wrong, because already&#13;
for three years I have not been in direct contact with themâ&#128;&#148;there is a tendency is that&#13;
they will give priority to the urban rather than the rural areas through the development.&#13;
For Indonesia, at least, I think it is wrong, wrong because, first, the biggest part of the&#13;
population live in the rural areas, and then the base of the Indonesian economy are in the&#13;
rural areas, and if we improve the situation in the urban areas too much--it is already now&#13;
too much because the private sector come in, so it's already fairly high like here. So that&#13;
we attract more people, more and more, so the urbanization will be accelerated because&#13;
the private sector already attracted to the cities, especially the bigger cities. So the&#13;
government sector should give the priority and concentrate on the rural, including also&#13;
small-scale industry in the rural areas. Not only agriculture: off-farm. Off-farm income&#13;
should be also promoted, not only--otherwise people will move to big cities. It is not&#13;
only in Indonesia--it is everywhere--but at least we have here to try to avoid the big&#13;
urbanization to the bigger cities.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Does the government have any programs for promoting small-scale enterprise&#13;
in the rural areas?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yes. And I think this is assisted by World Bank in the&#13;
studies, small-scale and medium-size industries.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You say the Bank is involved in that?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah. But this should be more concentrated on the rural&#13;
areas and the small cities, then the dispersal of population will get better. Now the trend&#13;
is people going to the big cities.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Have there been any sort of projects on regional development which would&#13;
take a spatial approach?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, thereâ&#128;&#153;s regional development projects, but again that's in&#13;
the program, study and program. Implementation again, it will go to the sectors so&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a problem always of coordination. Who coordinates with who, and then always&#13;
like that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is Taiwan a model, do you think, for that kind of development?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: I don't know. I have visited Taiwan twice for irrigation&#13;
development, and that is a good synchronization between the [inaudible] irrigation and&#13;
the agriculture proper, including off-farm because they have factories in the rural areas,&#13;
but there was a negative impact on the pollution. So the pollution was spread; also the&#13;
industrial pollution was spread also to the rural areas. But the idea to have off-farm&#13;
income, source of income in the rural areas was good.&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was wondering which other countries you tend to compare yourselves with in&#13;
terms of maybe similar development, maybe sometimes some they are models or maybe&#13;
your models, but, say, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Well, yeah, certain areas. For instance, for Java you can learn&#13;
from Korea or Taiwan, but take Kalimantan or Irian Jaya, itâ&#128;&#153;s different, entirely different.&#13;
That is the problem for us. It will be a national program. Implementation should be case&#13;
by case. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s why, as you know, our coat of arms is â&#128;&#156;Unity in Diversity.â&#128;&#157; So, say,&#13;
in Jakarta here compared with Irian Jaya, which is still Stone Age, is entirely different.&#13;
So Taiwan is like West Java province, only West Java, the size. So we can take, say,&#13;
development in West Java taking Taiwan as a model, so also the stage of the&#13;
development of the rural communities also could be compared with them. Malaysia,&#13;
maybe we could take them for Sumatra. But for Indonesia for a nationwide model is not&#13;
so easy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Have you a sense that the quality of technical assistance in infrastructure&#13;
projects by the Bank, has the quality been improving, declining or the same?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Iâ&#128;&#153;m out of date in these three years, but . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The quality of the aid now is younger [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: People are younger?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: People are younger, huh?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Less experienced?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is that better or worse?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: In my opinion, too much consultant services, too much on loans.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: On loans?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Big amounts . . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Up to fifteen . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Fifteen percent of so million, too much consultant. But maybe&#13;
also a little difficult to be avoided because while the World Bank are now concentrating&#13;
on getting alsoâ&#128;&#148;assistance not only on physical implementation but also now an&#13;
institutional approach, training, human resources development, and for institutions you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
need a consultantâ&#128;&#153;s services here. But a little bit too much here, so big amounts are given&#13;
in loans for consultant services.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You know, when we look at the overall picture, itâ&#128;&#153;s clear that Indonesia has&#13;
received considerable financial assistance, but also thereâ&#128;&#153;s been a very important policy&#13;
dialogue. But what we see and hear is high-level dialogue, the ministers, the planning.&#13;
But I wonder if thereâ&#128;&#153;s much low-level dialogue thatâ&#128;&#153;s going on all the time because I&#13;
think this year someone said there would be 5,000 World Bank people in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No. Five thousand . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Nights, five thousand nights.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . man days.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Man days. So all these people running around, talking to people: is there a lot&#13;
of dialogue, training, example, advice? Do you see the results of that?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: You mean the World Bank people or consultants outside World&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Both, both, but financed by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: First, with the World Bank people, I think there's a dialogue that&#13;
takes place. So I think in every day has to--movement. So with the World Bank people&#13;
there is a dialogue not only at the high levels but there is also at the lower levels and even&#13;
in the regions with governors offices in the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When you were minister, did you see that in your ministry? Did you feel that&#13;
this was helping, training people?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Training, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: More people were learning?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yes. Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: At medium, lower levels?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: But transfer, transfer of knowledge from consultants to the&#13;
counterparts is less than we had expected, except in projects where thereâ&#128;&#153;s a special&#13;
training program. There is [inaudible] , yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So sort of the development of local capabilities?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you believe that the Bank has underemphasized that?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, no.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Because thereâ&#128;&#153;s only the time is limited . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The idea is there.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: . . because of the design, the design or something like that. So&#13;
there's not enough time to, you know . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: For consultants.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: . . for consultants to [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: In all agreements, in all contexts, always be considered. It is&#13;
recognized by the World Bank that in every consultant services they should acknowledge&#13;
as we do that their local counterparts should be there, we also emphasize. But in practice&#13;
these consultants are too busy because thereâ&#128;&#153;s a time constraint [inaudible] transfer. But&#13;
now thereâ&#128;&#153;s--all consultants, they are encouraged, encouraged--we call it â&#128;&#156;encouragedâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
because we are not, we cannot say they have to, but we encourage working together with&#13;
local consultants. And this is now the way that . . . [both speaking at once] All foreign&#13;
consultants are now working with Indonesian or . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Some of the Indonesian consultants [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: So it is now getting better and better.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's just an encouragement and not a requirement, is it?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Itâ&#128;&#153;s not allowed.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It's not allowed in the guidelines. That was always a big fight.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The encouragement is what?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: To work with local partners.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was wondering whether you have a policy of, when you get a consultant, of&#13;
teaming him with a counterpart within the ministry.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: We cannot force them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can't?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No, no, because of the guidelines. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not allowed.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank guidelines, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Bank guidelines. It's not allowed. But we always have&#13;
encouraged and tell the consultant, â&#128;&#156;You know, you understand what this means,&#13;
â&#128;&#152;encourageâ&#128;&#153;? You understand?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
All consultants are now working with Indonesian firms, and I think also the Indonesian&#13;
consultants are now ready--at that moment they are not ready yet to work together, but&#13;
now, now in the â&#128;&#152;90s I think they are now ready to work together as partners. Even some&#13;
firms are now, Indonesian firms, are now leading firms in their consortium [inaudible]&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You're thinking about consultants as somebody who does engage in some kind&#13;
of problem-solving activity and then makes an analysis or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. You also can get a consultant who is an advisor to a decision-maker in&#13;
government, a bureaucrat who would have a consultant who would be an advisor to him.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Not in the ministry of public works.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Not in public works?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: In the BAPPENAS system there is. I mean with the policy-&#13;
makers never. In this BAPPENAS is . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: BAPPENAS, the ministry of finance . . [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The Harvard team [Harvard Institute for International&#13;
Development] and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . but it's confined just to those areas [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: But not in the ministry of public works. It was always a&#13;
consultant black hole. There wereâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m not [inaudible] â&#128;&#148;there were bilateral advisors in&#13;
the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There were, yes, but they've gone now.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah. Government officials from these countries who assist us.&#13;
It was alreadyâ&#128;&#148;the people, in the â&#128;&#152;80s we didn't have that already.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Talking about these consultant services, I have suggested to the&#13;
World Bank to change the procurement of consultants. I suggest we use the system of&#13;
EEC [European Economic Community] in use here and that is--as you know, the World&#13;
Bank guidelines require that there is a two-envelope system. There is the technical&#13;
proposal and in a separate envelope the financial proposal but at the same time, and then&#13;
we evaluate the technical proposal without taking into consideration the financial&#13;
envelope. We are not allowed to open it. So there is a pointing system that is performed&#13;
by the two sides. We take the first in line, the second in line, the first in line, and if it's&#13;
first in line, we negotiate the consultant for the financial terms, and that takes a long time,&#13;
takes a long time, sometimes six months.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Even more, even more, one year. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: So I suggest--but it was not approved at that moment, but in a&#13;
certain moment the World Bank has not other ideas [inaudible] So at that moment I&#13;
suggest to take the system of the EEC. So the system of EEC is like this: we agree, both&#13;
of us agree a certain level which is [inaudible] grade for consultant services, say, point&#13;
70 above; 70 lower we cannot consider, but 70 above, that could be considered to be&#13;
procured. Then we open the financial proposal of thisâ&#128;&#148;say, above 70 from the seven&#13;
invited, say three has points above 70. So we open the three and take the cheapest one,&#13;
the cheapest one. No negotiation anymore, just the cheapest one from the one who is&#13;
above 70. This is quicker. It is agreed, yes, by the World Bank, but itâ&#128;&#153;s not yet in the&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Their guidelines are that the three above 70, the one with the highest, which is,&#13;
say, 88, you would only talk with that one?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . whereas the Bank says, â&#128;&#156;No, you only talk with the one at 88, and then you&#13;
negotiate the financing.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, and open only that one. And that takes a long time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: My model would be to weight both of them, the grade and the cost, and come&#13;
out with the least cost per unit of quality. You could do that quite easily.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The negotiation, that takes a long time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yeah, but if they had a price, and you also knew the way they stacked up,&#13;
the grade, then you could easily work out a formula that would give you the least cost per&#13;
quality delivered.&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: But still you negotiate, you see.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, it would be harder to negotiate, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: It takes a long time because we would like to have this. They&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;No, we cannot.â&#128;&#157; Six months: thatâ&#128;&#153;s the practice. I don't know who is--I don't say&#13;
that this is the fault of the consultants, of our consultants, but in practice up to now is&#13;
already for years takes a long time, and that makes the delays in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But of course the consultant who you choose who has 89 points knows that&#13;
he's the only one . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yeah, and he is in a bargaining position.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . so they are in a bargaining position, why should they already . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And for a developing country itâ&#128;&#153;s not necessary to have the 89.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Eighty is okay for us, especially with this cheaper, easier project&#13;
like irrigation or roads. If it is nuclear or like that, okay, but if the implementation is&#13;
easy, why should we have 89 point, 88 is the expensive one. Even 75 or 80 is good&#13;
enough.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Of course, if thereâ&#128;&#153;s some kind of correlation between high grades and Western&#13;
firms, I mean, their origin, this is a way of protecting the western share, the American and&#13;
the European share of the business, I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Well, not necessarily so because the Japanese can always also&#13;
capacities [all talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, the Japanese and also the [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The super Part I countries. Normally, has it been your experience that the&#13;
ones which are 75 and 78 are relatively speaking more from countries, from developing&#13;
countries, say Korea or Taiwan, whereas the 89 and 90 are Japan, Germany, U.S.? Is that&#13;
what usually happens?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Sometimes the British come back also at 75, 78 and 88, 89 also&#13;
be the [inaudible] other firms of Great Britain. It has nothing to do with geographical or&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Tell me again, how are these scores assigned? That's done by . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Agreement. Agreement between the World Bank and the&#13;
borrower. First, say, general experience . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You must be able to identify the . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: First of all, a long list. We have gotten experience with lists as&#13;
long as 80 interested consultants. So thereâ&#128;&#153;s one case that is under training, but normally&#13;
we take seven or five to make a short list out of, a short list out of so many, 70 . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't look at their proposals. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And then 70, yes, we ask technical advisor proposals based on&#13;
the implementation documents, terms of reference and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Those documents must identify the country of origin, don't they? Can't you tell&#13;
what country the firm comes from?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: All are members, all World Bank members.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, but as you look at their credentials, their documents, and decide whether&#13;
this is 88 or 78, can't you tell from their records what sort of a firm it is?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can't tell?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No, there is no geographical aspect.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You're supposed to be country-blind? I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Country-blind, yeah. Not necessarily so, say, from Great Britain&#13;
always aye; from U.S. always no. We cannot say that. The countries are different. [all&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What is the difference? [both speaking at once] I mean, how does it matter?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I mean, the record, if you show me a couple of--I'm thinking about&#13;
admitting students. If you are going to grade the desirability of the application, it's very&#13;
hard if you have a very detailed application not to know what part of the world that&#13;
person comes from.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But insofar as you know, then how does that matter?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It doesn't. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t matter, but it would mean that you would, you and the&#13;
Bank would be agreeing that this one or that one is the best one and you would know the&#13;
nationality of the firm.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But normally . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Afterwards, yeah, yeah. But not--I cannot say either France or&#13;
that country is always better than from that country.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, no, I donâ&#128;&#153;t mean that. I just meant that you, in making that, assigning that&#13;
value, you would in the course of making that determination know that it was a French&#13;
firm.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: We donâ&#128;&#153;t know. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Are you saying that as you do the short listing, in the short listing you know&#13;
which are the countries . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. All right. All right. That's all I'm . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Now I see. In the short listing. Not in the evaluation. In the&#13;
short list from the long list of possible evaluees, and then you have the short list of&#13;
possible consultant, but according to the guidelines sometimes you take five and&#13;
according to the agreement you send to the World Bank: â&#128;&#156;Do you agree with the short&#13;
list?â&#128;&#157; And then they say yes or no. And we agree to the short list and then the&#13;
evaluation, this pointing system: the experience of the firm, responsiveness of the terms&#13;
of reference, and then the staffing, the manning of the team, the team leader and&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But they don't make any price offer? They don't offer . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Technical proposal.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Technical proposal. They don't price it, though; they're on the . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, on the second . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the two envelope.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the two envelope system.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: One has the technical proposal, the C.V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: One is the technical proposal, the proposed methodology and so&#13;
on, and the other is the . . .&#13;
&#13;
So the point is that with this system, it takes a long time, so at least one year, and we&#13;
don't disburse or reimburse yet the loan because the process, but still we have to pay this&#13;
commitment fee of 3.4 percent. So that is, I think, not fair with us because even if the&#13;
project unit is efficient, but because the process of project development takes time, even&#13;
if there is no problem of this negotiation, even if it is the EEC system, still at least six&#13;
months is in the process of procurement of consultant coming here, mobilization, coming&#13;
here, so six months. Instead in the six months we have to pay the commitment fee for not&#13;
disbursing, for undisbursed loans, who I think--and that is 100 percent of the loan, that's&#13;
three point . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Three-fourths.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Three-fourths of a percent to pay.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Who pays that? The ministry of public works or the ministry of finance?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: The government does through finance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Finance. It's not charged to the budget of the, of your organization.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: No, from the national budget, a special [both speaking at once]&#13;
loans.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Another question.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: But still it is from the national budget.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I understand. No, no, no. I was just wondering about something else. But the&#13;
minister of finance, he must be very happy to have World Bank loans.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But what about the minister of public works? Are you happy?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes? Or do you prefer to have money from other sources? From the budget or&#13;
from other donors?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Well, we [both speaking at once] ask, it doesn't matter as long as&#13;
the loan is not too tied with the [inaudible] in the interest rate as well as in the&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You don't find it too complicated, working with the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Well, in the beginning, yes. Not any longer.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You're saying in effect that if there are too many conditions, you'd rather have&#13;
it from another donor. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Bilateral is usually easier, but their loans, their assistance is not&#13;
very much yet.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see. But if you had the option of getting for a project the money from a&#13;
bilateral with the same amount, with the same thing, you would . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Oh, yeah, bilateral.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bilateral. Easier. [Laughter] [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: [inaudible] Japan is easier.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Japan is easier!&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Who makes that decision? Do you make the decision or is it made at the level&#13;
of BAPPENAS, whether, you know, if you, say, are thinking of . . .&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: First, there's a process. So the staff, we make first our lobby&#13;
with the embassy here, with the office of the World Bank, and then . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: [inaudible] World Bank says, â&#128;&#156;Okay, we think this project is&#13;
good.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And then both we have [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If it's a good project, they both bid for it?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And sometimes a good project, not only the World Bank is&#13;
interested but Asian Development Bank is interested, Japan is interested. So then we&#13;
talk, and we talk further with the BAPPENAS, of course. So this is the process of the&#13;
project development, and then BAPPENAS will decide, â&#128;&#156;Now, okay, we take this from&#13;
this source, this from that other source.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Some donors claim that, bilaterals, that the World Bank tends to get the best&#13;
projects in that process. Is that true or not?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Not always.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: If thereâ&#128;&#153;s high foreign content weâ&#128;&#153;ll do it with bilaterals.&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: High foreign content.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Because itâ&#128;&#153;s lower there; the interest rate is lower.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Between the Asian . .&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Sort of like in irrigation, say: Japan likes to have something&#13;
of flood control, the big rivers. So the high foreign content because it needs the&#13;
construction equipment Japan has. So the Bank, the World Bank and ADB, so they-- the&#13;
project is quite visible, but the foreign content is [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: And not only that. With the Bank, that is different. The Bank&#13;
has to look at the IRR and so on, but bilateral assistance [both speaking at once] the&#13;
social aspects, not only economical aspects. For instance, new roads. New roads in this&#13;
eastern part, in this less-developed province of Indonesia, you cannot base the studies on&#13;
traffic only in those areas. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no traffic yet. We have to open isolated areas to&#13;
economical exposure; itâ&#128;&#153;s by law. So, but no, there is some change, change already. So&#13;
World Bank is now also bearing roads that we also are [inaudible] new areas, isolated&#13;
areas open up. Economically IRR is rather low because thereâ&#128;&#153;s no traffic yet.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the World Bank is not prepared to sort of take risks like that?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Twenty percent, twenty. The maximum is twenty percent of&#13;
the loan can go to these kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Also [inaudible] But bilateral is easier. They understand, like&#13;
Canada and Japan and so on, [inaudible] not only on economical aspects. World Bank is&#13;
20 percent, and the moment, at that moment, zero.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: These costs are very, very heavy.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: [inaudible] economically should be above 11 percent or&#13;
something like that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What is your sense of the difference, say, between the ADB and the World&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Itâ&#128;&#153;s nearly the same.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Both in terms of staffing, procurement, consultants, quality?&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: [inaudible] problems with their persons [inaudible] personally,&#13;
but not in the system--as an agency.&#13;
&#13;
                              Suyono Sastrodarsono&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Once again about this three-fourths percent as a commitment fee.&#13;
ADB has done what?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: ADB.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: ADB has done this rule that for the first year?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First year.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: First year only 40 percent of the loan has to be compensated as&#13;
commitment fee, not 100 percent. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to understand that even if the project&#13;
office is efficient, the first year you cannot spend much. So not this three-fourths, not of&#13;
100 percent but of 40 percent. And the second year is?&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fifty.&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Fifty percent because they--even from the first day, the first year,&#13;
we have to pay three-fourths of 100 percent in commitment fee. That is . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I thought the commitment fee is now being stopped.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Being eliminated.&#13;
&#13;
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Not yet, not yet. They are still temporarily considering to&#13;
reduce from three-fourths to one-fourth, but it's not yet decided.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's not yet [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: Maybe it's at the higher level in Washington is already, but not&#13;
implemented yet.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I think we've already--you've been very generous.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Very generous indeed. And you've fed us lunch to boot!&#13;
&#13;
SASTRODARSONO: So if there are other questions . .&#13;
