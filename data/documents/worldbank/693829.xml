EL NINO EMERGENCY FLOOD PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
L. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. El Nifio Impact in Argentina&#13;
1.    The El Niho Phenomenon. El Nifio is the biggest cause of climate variability in the world.&#13;
El Niflo is Spanish for "Christ Child", given that name because of its early December&#13;
manifestation in the coastal Pacific waters of Peru and Equador, where abnormally warm sea&#13;
surface temperatures (SSTs) often signal the beginning of positive SST anomalies over the eastern&#13;
half of the equatorial Pacific. In parallel, there is an atmospheric phenomenon known as the&#13;
Southern Oscillation, named and described by Sir Gilbert Walker, which consists of an east-west&#13;
atmospheric pressure see-saw, causing changes in the Pacific trade winds, that directly affects&#13;
tropical weather around the globe. Given that these two events occur in parallel, scientists refer&#13;
to it as the El Nifno/Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), though for simplicity, the event is&#13;
generally referred to as El Nifio.&#13;
3.    Normal conditions. El Nifio is a cyclical event that occurs every three to seven years and&#13;
lasts for approximately two years. Each El Nifio has its own characteristics; no one observed&#13;
cycle has repeated itself to date. During normal conditions the trade winds blow toward the west&#13;
across the tropical Pacific. These winds pile up warm surface water in the western Pacific, so that&#13;
the sea surface is about one-half meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador. The sea surface&#13;
temperature is also about eight degrees Celsius (C) higher in the west, with cool temperatures off&#13;
the Pacific coast of South America arising because of an upwelling of cold water from deeper&#13;
ocean levels. This cold water is nutrient-rich, supporting high levels of primary productivity,&#13;
diverse marine ecosystems, and major fisheries. Rainfall comes from the rising air over the&#13;
warmest water, while the eastern Pacific is relatively dry. Observations have shown that the cool&#13;
water (generally below about 170 C) is within 50 meters of the sea surface.&#13;
4.    El Niuo conditions. During an El Nifio the prevailing low-pressure system over Indonesia&#13;
moves eastward, weakening the high pressure system near South America (the difference in&#13;
atmospheric pressure is measured between Darwin and Tahiti). As a result the easterly trade&#13;
winds relax in the central and western Pacific. The water that has accumulated in the western&#13;
Pacific now has no force holding it in place. The Pacific behaves like a bath tub that is suddenly&#13;
lifted at one end, that is the warm surface water that has built up in the west slopes back eastward,&#13;
reversing the direction of the sea surface current. Sea levels and SST off the coast of South&#13;
America rise, and the thernocline (the temperature gradient between cold and warm water) is&#13;
pushed down to a much deeper level, leading to a depression of the thermocline (known as a&#13;
warm phase) in the eastern Pacific Ocean waters and an elevation of the thermocline in the west&#13;
(Australia). Rainfall follows the warm water eastward, causing flooding in Peru, southern Brazil,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
and northern Argentina and draught in the western Pacific (Indonesia and Australia). The&#13;
eastward discharge of the atmospheric heat source overlying the warmest waters result in large&#13;
changes in the global atmospheric circulation, which in turn causes global climate variability.&#13;
Weather anomalies occur all over the globe every year, but a distinctive few do tend to recur with&#13;
most or all El Nifio events and are thus referred to as teleconnections (climate anomalies&#13;
associated with El Nifno).&#13;
5.    La Ninia conditions. At the end of the El Niflo cycle is an equally important occurrence:&#13;
La Nifia. This event is marked by the injection of water that is colder than usual (a rise in the&#13;
thermocline), causing the waters of the eastern Pacific to cool considerably. This event has the&#13;
opposite impact of the El Nifo event, meaning droughts occur where floods once were and&#13;
above-normal rainfall in draught areas, causing floods even in eastern Australia.&#13;
6.    During the last century more than a dozen El Nifno events have affected the South&#13;
American coast. Graph 1 of Appendix 1 shows the Multivariate ENSO Index, or MEI, (positive&#13;
values indicate El Nifio) used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency to illustrate&#13;
the strength of the six strongest (measured) El Nifnos of the century. The milder El Nifio events&#13;
raise water temperatures only a degree or two along the 5,000-mile equatorial Pacific band. The&#13;
stronger events, like the El Nifio of 1982-83, raise temperatures 5-10°C and have had a major&#13;
impact not only on local weather but on climatic conditions around the globe.&#13;
7.    The first three events (1957-58, 1965-66, and 1972-73) all featured an early warming in&#13;
the far eastern Pacific and reached their standardized peak before the end of the first year. The&#13;
more recent events (1982-83, 1986-87, and 1991-92) took longer to mature, lacking the early&#13;
warming in the eastern Pacific, and typically reached their peak in the spring of their second year&#13;
or even later.&#13;
8.    El Nino impact in Argentina. In Latin America, particularly Argentina, El Ninio events&#13;
have coincided with severe flooding in the Parana River basin (Appendix 2), a 2,600,000 km2 area&#13;
that encompasses important regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay, and Paraguay in&#13;
its entirety. The 1982-83 event gave rise to the worst flooding in the Parana basin in the&#13;
twentieth century, with an estimated US$1.8 billion in economic losses. Along with the flooding&#13;
came incidences disease breakouts, given the damage to potable water and sanitation facilities,&#13;
and the collapse of other social infrastructure services, such as electricity, roads, telephones,&#13;
schools, hospitals, and housing. On a smaller scale, the 1992 flood, which coincided with the&#13;
1991-92 El Nifio, also had a tremendous impact on the basin, with economic losses at US$905&#13;
million and 3.1 million inhabitants flooded. The moderate 1966 and 1977 floods resulted in about&#13;
US$750 million and US$266 million in economic losses, respectively. However, as the region&#13;
develops economically', the number of people affected increases each time there is a new flood,&#13;
even if the flood is of a lesser magnitude.&#13;
The export growth rate of the northeast provinces in 1994 was greater than that of any other region, reflecting&#13;
good cereals, cotton, petroleum, and tea expansion, particularly in Chaco and Corrientes. (Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report, "Argentina: Flood Protection Project", October 29, 1996).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
9.    The 1997-98 El Nino. The return of El Ninio was first detected in the eastern Pacific in&#13;
May 1997. This event has reached the time of year when seasonal persistence should guarantee&#13;
full-blown El Nino conditions through at least early 1998. Indicators used to monitor the event&#13;
show that it has matured very quickly, appearing to have reached its standardized peak (nearly&#13;
+2.9 units above normal conditions in July-August 1997) before the end of the first year. This&#13;
event shows a similar pattern of development to those of 1957-58, 1965-66, and 1972-73,&#13;
although has the strength of that of the 1982-83 event. Although these temperature anomalies&#13;
started earlier than in 1982-83, they could, if sustained through the southem hemnisphere's&#13;
summer months (December-April), give rise to rainfall on a scale experienced in 1982-83 (Map A&#13;
and B of Appendix 1).&#13;
10.   Based on the behavior to date and statistical correlation with trends in the past, when early&#13;
maturing occurs, a quick oscillation in the cycle tends to occur, giving rise to a La Nifia event in&#13;
June-July of the following year. This consensus is also shared by the scientific community and&#13;
predicted in several climate models used by the National Weather Service (NWS), the Center for&#13;
Ocean, Land and Atmosphere Studies (COLA), and the Bureau of Meteorology Research Center&#13;
(BMRC). Such an occurrence would lead to above-normal rainfall in the northwestern provinces&#13;
of Argentina. (Appendix 3 contains an analysis on the possible impact of El Nifno in Argentina&#13;
over the course of the next six to nine months.)&#13;
11.   The impact of the 1997-98 on Argentina. The signs of El Nifo have been present for&#13;
several months in the Parana basin. In southern Brazil substantial rains have flooded the Uruguay&#13;
River, which discharges directly into the Parana river delta. The Uruguay River has historically&#13;
not been a source of severe flooding until this year, in which it exceeded the 100-year flood event.&#13;
In fact, in the major city of Concordia (Entre Rios), that has a river flow discharge record since&#13;
1898, has suffered damages from floods as never before. El Nifio-related floods have affected a&#13;
population of about 200,000 since July 1997. As of November 24, 1997 about 12,500 people had&#13;
been evacuated from their homes in four different provinces (Table 1, Appendix 1), 11,600 of&#13;
them living in the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios, which borders the Uruguay River.&#13;
What is even more unusual is that when the Uruguay River floods, it does so for a short amount&#13;
time because of its steeply sloped riverbed. However, the Parana River has been flowing full all&#13;
year (approximately 1.5 meters above normal river height), impeding the Uruguay River from&#13;
flowing into the delta. The Parana River has had an elevated flow because the Pantanal (a large&#13;
wet-land region in southern Brazil and Paraguay) in Paraguay has been roughly 2.0 meters over&#13;
its normal water height since April 1997.&#13;
12.   As previously mentioned, there is a consensus that this year's El Nifio could quickly&#13;
diverge into the cold phase around June-July 1998. Such an occurrence would bring less&#13;
precipitation to the ParanA basin, while the arid and semi-arid regions of the northwest would be&#13;
susceptible to an increase in rainfall. Taking into consideration the region's geomorphological&#13;
characteristics and snowmelt period (1997 recorded an above-normal accumulation of 20 meters&#13;
of snowpack), this would mean the occurrence of flash floods and mudslides. Although flash&#13;
floods are not persistent floods, like those in the ParanA that impede long-term rehabilitation&#13;
efforts, they can sweep away urban infrastructure and damage related services in a matter of&#13;
minutes, causing social, economic, and environmental losses, and, even worse, the loss of human&#13;
life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

B. Government Strategy&#13;
13.   Previous emergency actions. As a consequence of the serious floodings of the Parana,&#13;
Paraguay and Uruguay basins in 1992, the Government of Argentina (GoA) asked the Bank to&#13;
finance an emergency project to rehabilitate the damaged infrastructure across all sectors. The&#13;
Bank answered the request by providing US$170 million to finance the US$270 million Flood&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3521-AR) and by amending US$20 million from the Provincial&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3280-AR). During the execution of the Flood Rehabilitation Project,&#13;
SUCCE contracted several studies on the integrated management of the alluvial basins of the&#13;
Parana, Paraguay, and Uruguay. As a result from these studies undertaken, the Flood Protection&#13;
Project (Loan 4117-AR) was defined and prepared to further enhance protection of the provinces&#13;
located in the littoral region. In order to achieve this greater protection, both structural and non-&#13;
structural measures were incorporated into project design.&#13;
14.   Current government response. The Federal Government, through assessments undertaken&#13;
by the provinces, has developed a plan to mitigate current and forecast disasters through: (i) a&#13;
protection and rehabilitation phase for the northwestern provinces (Salta, Jujuy, Tucuman,&#13;
Santiago del Estero, Catamarca, and La Rioja) that are expected to be affected in March-June&#13;
1998; and (ii) a rehabilitation phase for the littoral provinces (Misiones, Formosa, El Chaco,&#13;
Corrientes, Entre Rios, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires) of the Parana basin already affected. The&#13;
protection phase is set to be implemented in anticipation of El Niuo, and the rehabilitation phase&#13;
once El Nino has occurred. Criteria to define the arrival and severity of El Nio are included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual (POM). Authorities from the Government of Argentina have&#13;
requested assistance from the Bank in further defining and preparing of such a plan, along with&#13;
help to meet the identified requirements for each phase. Based on the preparation done by the&#13;
provinces and the Central Government of Argentina, the Bank has responded in a "fast track"&#13;
mode to assist with the implementation of this strategy.&#13;
15.   Mobilization of other sources. While design and preparation of the proposed loan&#13;
develops, there has been an effort to respond immediately to the flooding in the littoral provinces,&#13;
along the Uruguay River, and the possible consequences of El Nino in the northwestern&#13;
provinces. The Government of Argentina has taken actions to identify financial resources to&#13;
address the current emergency in both geographic regions. The Ministry of Interior, through the&#13;
Secretaria de Asistencia Financiera a las Provincias (SAFP), analyzed all Bank-financed projects&#13;
and the possibility of reallocating funds from those projects that are linked to provincial&#13;
development in the mentioned regions. Further actions on connunication and coordination&#13;
among governments and how to prepare for the impact of El Niio in each region were agreed on&#13;
between the Federal and provincial authorities over the course of several meetings and seminars&#13;
(Appendix 4) held since August of 1997. In these meetings, the SUPCEs and the provincial&#13;
Department of Hydraulics were given the responsibility of communication of the El Niflo event to&#13;
the public at the subnational level, while at the national level the Department of National Civil&#13;
Protection would be responsible.&#13;
16.   The Bank, in response to the Government's initial requests for assistance, immediately&#13;
identified approximately US$118 million of uncommitted funds from existing loans that could be&#13;
quickly reallocated to provide an immediate source of funding for emergency works. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
financing will satisfy current demands within the Parana basin, particularly on the Uruguay River&#13;
and its basin. The actions taken to date are the following:&#13;
(i) Last September the Bank extended the closing date of the Flood Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(Loan 3521-AR) in order to allow for the use of US$2.0 million of remaining funds to purchase&#13;
pumping equipment required to protect the city of Resistencia, Chaco (population 250,000).&#13;
(ii) The Bank has informned the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM), cofinancier of the&#13;
recently effective Flood Protection Project, on the proposed adjustment that would speed up&#13;
implementation of about US$90.0 million in flood protection investments in the Parana basin.&#13;
The Bank also intends to include in the amendment an additional US$11.0 million of identified&#13;
drainage and protection works for several cities along the Uruguay River (this change to Loan&#13;
4117-AR requires consultation with JEXIM). JEXIM informed the Bank that they were notified&#13;
of the situation and await an official request from the GoA.&#13;
(iii) The Provincial Development Project I (Loan 3280-AR) is being amended to reallocate&#13;
US$14.0 million to finance works in the littoral and northwestern provinces.&#13;
17.   Although funds have been identified, certain provincial governments face such situations&#13;
that they had to declare states of emergencies to place into motion mechanisms that allow for&#13;
better management of disaster relief As of July 1, 1997, the GoA acknowledged the signs of the&#13;
El Niiio phenomenon in the country and the severe consequences it implies. Three of the littoral&#13;
provinces (as of print date) have declared a state of emergency: (i) the Province of Chaco on&#13;
October 15, 1997 (Decree 2246-97); (ii) the Province of Corrientes on October 29, 1997, for a&#13;
period of one year (Decree 4329-97); and (iii) the Province of Entre Rios on November 11, 1997,&#13;
declaring that the state emergency began on August 31, 1997 (Decree 4060-97). More provinces&#13;
are expected to declare states of emergency as the elevated river flows move south into the delta&#13;
provinces.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from Previous Projects&#13;
18.   The main lesson is that physical rehabilitation alone is not adequate to reduce the risk of&#13;
future damage and thus sustain the benefits of the project, as well as to safeguard the people and&#13;
the communities at risk. Therefore, a combination of structural and non-structural measures must&#13;
be taken. Activities should be developed and coordinated, with the capacity to manage&#13;
emergencies at the provincial and local levels. The successful progress made in the Flood&#13;
Rehabilitation Project can be replicated by applying the following principles: (i) using investments&#13;
that are simple and easy to implement; (ii) designing projects to be flexible and not over-specified,&#13;
with the design being part of an ongoing process; (iii) encouraging participation of interested&#13;
provinces; (iv) maintaining highly competent local executing units with the capacity to deal with&#13;
emergencies; and (v) retaining the flexibility to shift funds among eligible provinces.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Assistance&#13;
19.   Given the scientific community's forecast of a potentially damaging El Nifio event, the&#13;
Bank's underlying purpose in Argentina is to help keep the affected regions on an economic and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
social development track through a systematic and cost-effective protection and rehabilitation&#13;
program. The experience gained from the Flood Rehabilitation Project makes the Bank uniquely&#13;
qualified, in the Government's view, to guide another emergency assistance program. In addition,&#13;
the investments required to carry out this program are unlikely to be mobilized from the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
20.   The Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS), which was discussed at the Board on May&#13;
15, 1997, aims to: (a) enhance social development, including poverty alleviation and human&#13;
resource development; (b) improve the performance and institutional capacity of government,&#13;
particularly subnational govermnents, to deliver key social, infrastructure and environmental&#13;
services; and (c) make successful structural reforms, including enhancement of governance&#13;
through institution building. Although the proposed emergency assistance operation was not&#13;
included in the CAS, it fully supports CAS objectives. It would advance the badly required&#13;
infrastructure base in the flood-prone areas and further enhance the provinces' capacity to manage&#13;
future emergencies. This ability is especially important in the flood-affected areas because of their&#13;
economic importance and their connection to MERCOSUR. Minimizing social and economic&#13;
disruption is critical to a long-term strategy of economic growth and poverty alleviation. The&#13;
project will have its greatest impact on the poorer northwestern provinces.&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
A. Objective&#13;
21.   The objective of the proposed project is to help the GoA's strategy to finance the&#13;
development and implementation of physical and institutional actions to address the impact of the&#13;
El Niuo phenomenon in the: (i) northwestern provinces of: Catamarca; Jujuy; La Rioja; Salta;&#13;
Santiago del Estero; Tucuman; and the Cuyo provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and San Luis; and&#13;
(ii) seven littoral provinces of Buenos Aires, El Chaco, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Formosa,&#13;
Misiones, and Santa Fe through additional works above and beyond the Flood Protection Project.&#13;
The specific project activities include assisting in the minimizing of loss or damage by way of&#13;
protection actions and the rehabilitation of infrastructure and related services to their existing&#13;
state prior to the emergency. An additional objective is to strengthen institutions in the&#13;
northwestern provinces to deal with flood emergencies.&#13;
B. Preparation&#13;
22.   Based on the Government's request for assistance to rehabilitate the damaged&#13;
infrastructure of the littoral provinces and to protect and rehabilitate (rehabilitation circa June/July&#13;
1998) infrastructure in the northwestern provinces, key members of SUCCE (Appendix 5) came&#13;
to Washington from November 13-24, 1997 to undertake the identification an preparation of a&#13;
possible emergency assistance loan. During SUCCE's mission to the Bank's headquarters,&#13;
identification, preparation and assessment of the adequacy of the existing institutional capacity for&#13;
dealing with flood emergencies and of works to be executed under the proposed loan took place.&#13;
The identification of works were based on the official requests from afflicted provinces and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
provinces expected to be impacted by El Nifno (Appendix 6). SUTCCE's familiarity with the state&#13;
of condition of the infrastructure in the region, due to participating in numerous missions in the&#13;
early months of 1997, to identify and evaluate damages incurred from recurring torrential rainfall,&#13;
facilitated understanding the required needs. Only the works considered to have the highest&#13;
priority were included in the emergency assistance loan and in the mobilization of financial&#13;
resources from existing loans (Appendix 6). Given the numerous amounts of works identified,&#13;
not all of the demand could be addressed within this emergency loan and the modification of the&#13;
existing loans. Thus, in following the Government's strategy in the northwestern region, it was&#13;
mentioned the identification of a subsequent operation in order to further carry out flood&#13;
forecasting and prevention capabilities to manage the impact of severe flooding in the region (to&#13;
be prepared at a later date). Beyond November 24, 1997, the chief executive officer and the&#13;
SUCCE counsel remained in Washington to carry out the preparation of legal documents and&#13;
provide additional input in the preparation of Bank documents. Negotiations took place from&#13;
December 9-11, 1997.&#13;
C. Description.&#13;
23.   The proposed project is based on the Bank's effort to assist countries which are expected&#13;
to be affected by El Niflo. The project is designed with two geographical components, one for the&#13;
northwestern provinces and one for the seven participating littoral provinces of the Parana basin.&#13;
A third component is included to address the incremental strengthening of SUCCE's&#13;
administrative and technical capacity to coordinate the implementation of the Project, including its&#13;
capacity to carry out project account audits. Given that the Loan would be made prior to the full&#13;
impacts of the aftermath of the El Nifno event, the proposed operation is designed to be&#13;
implemented in two distinct phases: (a) a protection phase of about 12 months for the&#13;
northwestern provinces; and (b) a rehabilitation phase for both geographic regions, estimated to&#13;
require up to three years. Eligibility criteria for investments under each phase will be included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual (POM). In addition, the project includes for the northwestern&#13;
provinces a capacity-building (establishment of SUPCE and civil defense strengthening) sub-&#13;
component to manage flood emergencies and a small scale housing sub-component. There is no&#13;
provincial institutional capacity investment sub-component for the littoral provinces because of&#13;
the current institutional mechanism placed into existence from the Flood Rehabilitation and Flood&#13;
Protection Projects. Detail project description is outlined in Appendix 7.&#13;
24. Protection works (US$10.0 million) for northwest region. This phase will finance&#13;
strengthening and maintenance measures in the northwestern provinces of key river defense&#13;
components, such as levees, embankment protection, channel bed cleaning and debris removal&#13;
actions, along with the construction of primary drainage canals. The works can be viewed in&#13;
terms of controlling waters originating from outside the urban zone while controlling and&#13;
channeling water originating within the protected urban zone to outside. Transport infrastructure&#13;
will be addressed through strengthening of bridges and adjacent road embankments from the&#13;
scouring affects of bottlenecked waters. The inclusion of this phase is to take a pro-active&#13;
approach to placing investments in high risk locations prior to the expected heavy rainfall, so as to&#13;
lessen the economic and social disruption of the La Nifia event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
25.   Rehabilitation works (US$38.2 million) for both regions. Rehabilitation works will need&#13;
to be undertaken immediately in the littoral provinces, in particular those provinces located along&#13;
the Uruguay River and in rural provincial interior locations. While the rehabilitation works to be&#13;
done in the northwestern provinces can not be fully ascertained until approximately June 1998.&#13;
These works may vary in magnitude, depending on the geographical impact of El Nifno and&#13;
whether the protection works were executed in locations in which the most amount of damaged&#13;
was avoided. Nevertheless, the rehabilitation of infrastructure includes: (i) health and education&#13;
facilities; (ii) transport infrastructure, specifically bridges; (iii) river defenses, river training&#13;
construction; (iv) channel clean-up; (v) water supply and sewerage (northwest only); and (vi)&#13;
drainage networks. Though the rehabilitation works to be financed for the northwestern&#13;
provinces will not be known with certainty until after June 1998, all rehabilitation works for&#13;
financing under the Bank project must be identified and presented to the Bank no later than 24&#13;
months after the effectiveness date of the project (uncommitted funds after 24 months will be&#13;
canceled). The POM will include indicators which establish the criteria for when a major weather&#13;
event has occurred and thus triggering the eligibility for Bank financing of the necessary&#13;
rehabilitation works. The rehabilitation phase of the project will be addressed in ongoing basis&#13;
during scheduled yearly Bank full supervision missions.&#13;
26.   Technical Assistance (US$9.9 million). Technical assistance (TA) for the proposed&#13;
project will be essentially for the northwestern provinces, except for: (i) the engineering and&#13;
supervision of works to be carried out in the littoral component (US$666,000); and (ii) the&#13;
strengthening of SUCCE's administrative and technical capacity (US$450,000), including project&#13;
accounts auditing (US$400,000), which will both be cost shared by all participating provinces.&#13;
Nhile TA for the littoral provinces in terms of regional studies, flood warning systems, civil&#13;
defense capacity and others were defined in the Flood Protection Project and thus will be funded&#13;
through that loan.&#13;
27.   The TA sub-component for the northwest encompasses many of the items covered for the&#13;
littoral provinces under the ongoing project, which are: (i) the establishment of a SUPCE in each&#13;
participating province and its institutional strengthening (US$3.6 million); (ii) civil defense&#13;
strengthening capacity (US$1.8 million) through training and development of a provincial&#13;
emergency plan, acquisition of communication equipment and flood forecasting technology (all&#13;
but acquisition of equipment to be undertaken by SUCCE); (iii) housing technical assistance&#13;
(US$ 186,000); (iv) a regional environmental study (US$2.1 million) to be integrated with the&#13;
regional flood-risk mapping, undertaken by SUCCE (environmental assessment of the whole&#13;
region and recommended necessary measures to reduce the impact of flood protection actions,&#13;
especially in those zones where periodic floodings affect sensitive ecosystems, TOR guidelines-&#13;
Appendix 8); and (v) basic and detailed engineering designs and engineering supervision during&#13;
construction (US$656,000).&#13;
28.   The TA assistance is fundamental to the establishment of a long-term strategy in flood&#13;
management coordination. The regional flood-risk study will delineate within basins of the&#13;
northwest the basic notion of where defense investments should be located and where new&#13;
development should occur. In order to carry out the institutional strengthening through the&#13;
creation of a SUPCE and the strengthening of civil defense capacity, an estimated 1,500 man-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
months will be required for three years, or roughly the contracting of six to seven individuals per&#13;
year for each province in the northwestern component.&#13;
29.   Housing (US$1.9 million). This sub-component has been assigned to serve as a&#13;
mechanism for institutional capacity building to the newly created SUPCEs of the northwestern&#13;
provinces. Given that the housing process is being introduced, each new SUPCE will be&#13;
designated only 50 housing units and will be implemented with the guidance of SUCCE, which&#13;
successfully supervised the execution of more than 5,800 housing units under the Flood&#13;
Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
30.   The basic is that a voluntary self-construction housing system will be provided for low-&#13;
income families located in areas highly vulnerable to floods and/or to those families whom have&#13;
had their dwelling severely damaged or destroyed by the flooding in the northwestern provinces.&#13;
Their new houses would be constructed in higher areas close to their present sites or in their&#13;
present sites with elevated foundations, if possible, to minimize dislocation, The housing units&#13;
would be designed based on the same criteria established in the Flood Protection Project. The&#13;
housing units would be 43 in2, with two bedrooms, a multi-use room, a shaded area and water&#13;
and drainage installations for the kitchen and bathroom. The cost for each unit would be about&#13;
US$6,200.&#13;
D. Cost&#13;
31.   The total cost of the prevention and rehabilitation phases for the proposed project is&#13;
estimated to be US$60.0 million, of which a vast majority would be local expenditures. Costs are&#13;
expressed in November 1997 prices and are based on experience with the previous two projects&#13;
(Loan 3521-AR and 4117-AR) and other similar projects in the area. Of the US$60.0 million,&#13;
US$35.0 would be initially allocated to the northwestern provinces and US$25.0 to the littoral&#13;
provinces. Of the US$35.0 million for the northwestern provinces, the flood prevention phase is&#13;
estimated to be US$15.0 million and the rehabilitation is estimated to be US$20.0 million. The&#13;
initial US$25.0 million allocation for the littoral provinces is designated towards rehabilitation.&#13;
Physical and price contingencies calculations came out to be about 10.9 percent of the total cost&#13;
of goods and works, collectively, for the project. Contingencies were dependent upon the&#13;
geographical region in which the goods were bought and the location of where the works were&#13;
executed. A summary of the project costs is presented in the Table 1 of Appendix 9. All costs&#13;
are expressed in US dollars because of the parity between the dollar and the peso, as established&#13;
in the Borrower's Convertibility Law (No. 23928 of April 1991).&#13;
E. Financing&#13;
32.   The Bank will finance at most 70 percent of the total project cost net of duties and taxes,&#13;
representing US$42.0 million of the total US$60.0 million. The remaining US$18.0 million will&#13;
be financed by the participating provinces, with no contribution envisage from the GoA. Due to&#13;
the emergency nature of the project, 20 percent of the total Bank financing (US$8.0 million) will&#13;
be provided for the retroactive financing of expenditures made after July 1, 1997, and in&#13;
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Table 2 of Appendix 9 illustrates the counterpart&#13;
funding requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
33.   The Bank loan would be made to the Argentine Republic. During appraisal, the&#13;
Government indicated its preference for US-dollar single currency loan repayable over 15 years,&#13;
including a five year grace period, at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate for&#13;
US dollar single currency loans. This was confirmed at negotiations. Proceeds of the loan would&#13;
be onlent to provincial governments eligible under this loan with the same terms and conditions as&#13;
Bank lending to the Argentine Republic. Provinces would assume the foreign exchange risk and&#13;
would guarantee repayment with their revenue-sharing funds and each participating province&#13;
would pay loan commitment fees.&#13;
F. Environment&#13;
34.   Environmental management procedures to be used during execution of the emergency&#13;
loan are the same as those established in the Flood Protection Project. With minor adjustments,&#13;
the existing environmental assessment capacity within SUCCE can provide the quality of scoping,&#13;
screening, environmental and social assessment, and supervision of works as needed.&#13;
Furthermore, with the understanding that all works involve the rehabilitation of existing&#13;
infrastructure or the protection from floods, no notable negative impacts are expected. In fact,&#13;
continuing with the best-practice approach of the ongoing Flood Protection Project, the works&#13;
would be revised from an environmental point of view to: (i) guarantee protection of existing&#13;
infrastructure and of the non-expansion of urban development into high-risk zones; (ii) generate&#13;
minimal interference in the natural process of the floodings; and (iii) produce a minimal effect on&#13;
the sensitive ecosystems of the regions. All sub-projects will comply with these conditions. In&#13;
parallel, the design of systems will be subject to an existing Environmental Manual (prepared&#13;
under the Flood Protection Project), which mitigates the environmental risks from the&#13;
construction of works. This manual, developed for the littoral provinces, will also be used in the&#13;
participating provinces of the Northwest. In parallel, during the execution of the proposed&#13;
project, a regional environmental assessment of the Uruguay River will be executed along the&#13;
same lines as that for the Parani River, through the Flood Protection Project (Loan 4117-AR). In&#13;
relation to the works in the northwestern provinces, a similar regional study will be conducted for&#13;
the designated long-term activities, including a full environmental analysis for selected basins in&#13;
the region.&#13;
G. Risks&#13;
35.   The risk of a lack of counterpart funding (CPF) is commonly associated with poor project&#13;
performance. This risk has been reduced since provincial counterpart funding required for&#13;
projects, which are co-financed by multilateral lending institutions, will now be guaranteed&#13;
through an agreement signed on November 24, 1997, between the Ministry of Interior and the&#13;
Asociacion de Bancos Ptblicosy Privados de Provincia de la Repuiblica Argentina (Association&#13;
of Provincial Public and Private Banks of the Argentine Republic).&#13;
36.   Another principal risk of this emergency assistance operation is related to the uncertainty&#13;
of the 1997-98 El Nifno in terms of its intensity and its precise geographic impact. Other risks&#13;
associated with the proposed project are weak institutional capacity in the northwestern provinces&#13;
and the time delays to obtain provincial debt law. All these mentioned risks are acceptable given&#13;
the high benefits such a proposed project can deliver to the populations of stricken areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 1-&#13;
IIL Project Implementation&#13;
A. Arrangements&#13;
37.   Project implementation and management would be based on the successful experience&#13;
acquired during the execution of the Flood Rehabilitation Project and Flood Protection Project in&#13;
the littoral provinces. This experience is based on the successful SUCCE-SUPCE structure,&#13;
which includes a well-established flow of information, function, and composition (staff and&#13;
responsibilities).&#13;
38.   SUCCE, under the Unidad Ejecutora Central (UEC) would remain within the boundary&#13;
of the Secretaria de Asistencia Financiera a las Provincias (SAFP) and would continue to be&#13;
responsible for the general administration of the project, including providing orientation and&#13;
technical assistance to the provinces (either directly or through the POM) for the preparation of&#13;
the project, and for all aspects related to the preparation, approval, and acquisition of the&#13;
subprojects. Likewise, SUCCE would contract the execution of the general institutional&#13;
development actions. SUCCE would report and obtain Bank approval in all matters related to&#13;
acquisition and disbursement, and SUCCE would continue providing the needed coordination&#13;
between the proposed project and other sectorial projects.&#13;
39.   Using the existing organizational framework, SUCCE would continue to be headed by the&#13;
chief executive, assisted by a team of consultants (subject to Bank prior review) in the project's&#13;
several infrastructure sectors. As described in the project description, the SUCCE team from the&#13;
ongoing Flood Protection Project would be increased slightly to address the additional demand&#13;
for project administration and technical assistance. An individual consultant would continue to&#13;
act as General Supervisor, with the responsibility of monitoring the project independently and&#13;
reporting to the SAFP.&#13;
40.   At the provincial level, the participating provinces would implement the project through a&#13;
SUPCE, which has already been established for the littoral provinces. The SUPCEs would then&#13;
have the responsibility for the formulation, execution, inspection, and administrative management&#13;
of the project at the provincial level. The SUPCEs would also be responsible for the&#13;
procurement, contracting and submission of disbursements, which are all subject to review by&#13;
SUCCE. A POM, to be modified from the Flood Protection Project (Appendix 10) and agreed,&#13;
will provide guidance and establish standards for all aspects of project implementation.&#13;
Agreement has also been reached on project performance indicators (Paragraph 62).&#13;
B. Eligibility Criteria for Subprojects&#13;
41.   The eligibility criteria for the rehabilitation phase are: (i) affected locations must be set&#13;
within eligible provinces; (ii) the infrastructure must have been damaged by the El Nifio-related&#13;
floods, identified between July 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998; (iii) acceptable technical,&#13;
economic, and environmental analysis of subprojects must be conducted, according to criteria&#13;
included in the POM; and (iv) a fully staffed SUPCE must be established, as laid out in the POM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
42.   Rehabilitation. To the extent possible, determining whether an area within the project's&#13;
boundaries has been affected by the El Nifio/La Nifia phenomenon (as stipulated in item (ii) of&#13;
paragraph 62) will be done using a hydrometerological indicator, if surpassed will trigger the&#13;
rehabilitation investments to be made. The following mechanism is still being considered and the&#13;
final agreed on indicator, its methodology, and its approach to measuring will be included in the&#13;
POM. At the moment, there is one indicator with two sets of thresholds, one for each geographic&#13;
region or component of the project. For the northwestern provinces a 24-hour rainfall event of a&#13;
probability of two percent per year (50-year rainfall) would be the trigger; while for the littoral&#13;
provinces a 24-hour rainfall event of a probability of one percent per year (100-year rainfall)&#13;
would be the trigger, which has already occurred. A lower restriction is in place for the&#13;
northwestern provinces because they lack previous flood-defense infrastructure investments. The&#13;
rainfall events should be observed at several strategically located rain gauges, which have an&#13;
adequate record database for at least the past 10 years. When one of the selected gauges for the&#13;
sub-basin in question records an amnount of rainfall that exceeds the threshold probability, then this&#13;
triggers the rehabilitation phase. Or alternatively, using the same identified gauges, when the&#13;
average cumulative rainfall is exceeded by a determined percentage over a designated time period,&#13;
then this would trigger the rehabilitation phase.&#13;
43.   Protection. Prevention works in the northwest provinces will be implemented regardless&#13;
of the impact of El Nifio. Thus their criteria for eligibility are items (i), (iii), and (iv) mentioned in&#13;
paragraph 41. Flood protection works (rehabilitation, too) are to be designed so as to avoid&#13;
economic damage (possible design criteria for the works are outlined in Appendix 11).&#13;
44.   Housing. Social workers from the municipalities would visit applicants and verify that&#13;
they met the program criteria. All beneficiaries would be required to sign a legal document&#13;
stating, among other things, that they (all relevant family members): lived on the site prior to the&#13;
floods; they owned the unit that was destroyed; the unit was their only residence and they have no&#13;
other property; they have no savings or other resources to rebuild the unit on their own; and they&#13;
plan to live in the area for at least three years. If the land on which they plan to build belongs to&#13;
someone else, the beneficiaries must provide signed approval from the owner allowing them to&#13;
use the land for at least three years or establish that they have occupied the land for at least the&#13;
past five years; agree to use the voucher as stipulated and to comply with all of its conditions and&#13;
requirements; agree to provide the labor needed to assemble their units; and agree to follow&#13;
instructions of the field technicians to ensure that the units are constructed in accordance with&#13;
safety requirements. Beneficiaries would also affirm their understanding that if they make any&#13;
false declaration or misuse the material received, they will be subject to judicial proceedings and&#13;
will have to make full restitution if found guilty. Beneficiaries who receive assistance through the&#13;
voucher program would not be eligible for any additional complementary and/or concessionary&#13;
assistance from the government for the units received.&#13;
45.   Provincial Criteria. In order to maintain the program's designed flexibility throughout&#13;
the implementation period, the following criteria would also be outlined in the POM that would&#13;
allow reassignment of onlent funds from province to province, pursuant to an understanding&#13;
between the central and provincial governments:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
(i) The northwestern provinces would have 12 months to put into effect a provincial debt&#13;
law. If such a debt law is not in place, or a lower-than-expected debt law is passed, then the&#13;
remaining designated funds may be reallocated to other eligible provinces.&#13;
(ii) Each participating littoral province has six months to put into effect its debt law,&#13;
otherwise the designated funds that it was unable to absorb may be reallocated to other littoral&#13;
provinces in the following six months. One year after effectiveness, all participating provinces&#13;
would be eligible to absorb the additional funds, given their financial capacity.&#13;
(iii) All funds that are not committed after 24 months from effectiveness may be canceled&#13;
by the Borrower.&#13;
C. Project Supervision and Review&#13;
46.   Bank project supervision is designed to be streamlined because of SUCCE's experience in&#13;
the implementation and supervision of the Flood Rehabilitation Project and Flood Protection&#13;
Project, and because the nature of the civil works are short-term (24 months). In addition, Bank&#13;
supervision missions will coincide with the supervision of the Flood Protection Project, with the&#13;
first review being conducted during the first trimester of 1999, or one year and after thirty days&#13;
after the effective date of the loan. This review would consider: (i) the commitment of each&#13;
participating province to the project by enacting the corresponding debt law; (ii) compliance of&#13;
each province with counterpart funding obligations; (iii) the specific rehabilitation subprojects in&#13;
each province; and (iv) the amount of the loan to be onlent to one or more eligible provinces. A&#13;
second review would be held in the first trimester of 2000. This second review would consider:&#13;
(i) compliance of each province with their counterpart funding obligations; and (ii) establishment&#13;
of the amount of the loan to be onlent to one or more eligible provinces. A third annual review&#13;
would continue to cover these topics, in addition to the preparing the Project Completion Report.&#13;
Appendix 12 illustrates the proposed timetable and inputs required for appropriate supervision.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
47.   Procurement arrangements and planning would be carried out )y SUCCE and the&#13;
SUPCEs of the participating provinces using similar arrangements identified in the POM of the&#13;
Flood Protection Project, yet modified for quick procurement action and to also reflect the new&#13;
Bank Guidelines for consultants.&#13;
48.   Procurement arrangements and thresholds have been determined considering flexibility and&#13;
previous experience with the Flood Rehabilitation Project. Because most of the rehabilitation&#13;
works to be carried out will be relatively in small size and executed in scattered locations&#13;
throughout both regions, contracts for civil works and goods would not be suitable for&#13;
procurement through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and thus would be awarded&#13;
primarily through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and three price quotation procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. In any event, many international firms are represented in Argentina and&#13;
would be eligible to participate in the bidding processes. Nevertheless, ICB documents, if used,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
will comply with the Bank's standard bidding documents. The NCB documents to be used are&#13;
those from the Flood Rehabilitation Loan, which were approved by the Bank in 1992.&#13;
49.   SUCCE would review all procurement procedure documents, bid evaluations, and&#13;
contract awards to ensure that the agreed procurement procedures were properly implemented.&#13;
Because the emergency nature of the project, and because NCB and price quotation contracts&#13;
would be too small and numerous for effective prior review by the Bank, such a review would be&#13;
delegated to SUCCE. But, to ensure that procurement procedures are satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
the Bank would do a prior review of the first two NCB and price quotation contracts per calendar&#13;
year. In addition, the Bank would review the remaining NCB procurement procedures, as well as&#13;
the price quotation and direct contracting, on a ex-post basis by sampling. If it were determined&#13;
that procurement did not follow agreed procedures, then no expenditures for such items would be&#13;
financed out of the loan proceeds, and the Bank would cancel the corresponding loan amount.&#13;
The Special Account would be reimbursed by the Borrower.&#13;
50.   Civil Works. Works estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million would be contracted&#13;
through ICB, while contracts estimated to cost less than US$5.0 million (estimated 11 contracts)&#13;
would be contracted through NCB, not to exceed an aggregate US$10.5 million. Three price&#13;
quotations will be allowed for contracts estimated to cost less than US$1.0 million (an estimated&#13;
105 contracts), up to an aggregate amount of US$35.0 million. Direct contracting procedures&#13;
will be used (in accordance with paragraph 3.7 of the Procurement Guidelines) for very small&#13;
repairs estimated to cost less than US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000.&#13;
Force account will not be financed by the Bank under the proposed loan.&#13;
51.   Goods. Goods estimated to cost more than US$1.0 million will be contracted through&#13;
ICB, using the Bank's standard bidding documents. Goods that cost between US$500,000 and&#13;
US$1.0 million will be procured through the NCB process, and goods estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$500,000 through shopping procedures (estimated 13 contracts) on the basis of at least three&#13;
price quotations, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million and US$2.2 million, respectively.&#13;
52.   Direct purchase of goods will be permitted through contracts under US$100,000 for such&#13;
items as construction equipment rental and goods related to emergency actions that the Borrower&#13;
used during the construction.&#13;
53.   Housing Materials. Materials for a small-scale housing program (approximately 300&#13;
units) for the northwestern provinces will be acquired in the same fashion as those used in the&#13;
Flood Rehabilitation Project and the Flood Protection Project. The SUPCEs will separate the&#13;
costs of construction materials in no more than four or five corresponding vouchers for the&#13;
principle stages of construction. Immediately, the SUPCEs will select the suppliers for the&#13;
corresponding materials by way of a bidding process based on estimates from at least three&#13;
different certified local suppliers. Based on the lowest bid received, all suppliers that decide to&#13;
accept this lowest price would sign a contract to supply materials at that price. The beneficiaries&#13;
are free to select any of the qualified suppliers contracted by the SUPCEs. This system has been&#13;
very successful in the previously mentioned projects, in which 5,820 new homes were built in&#13;
approximately 100 different locations with no reported cases of abuse or lack of control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
54.   Consultant Services. Consulting services will be contracted based on the following&#13;
criteria: (i) contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 or more (approximately US$1.0 million)&#13;
would be contracted using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS); (ii) for contracts estimated&#13;
under US$200,000 (approximately US$2.9 million) would be contracted using Least Cost&#13;
Selection (LCS); and (iii) contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 (approximately US$6.0&#13;
million) would be contracted to individual consultants, according to Bank Guidelines. All&#13;
documents to select and contract consultants would be approved by the Bank.&#13;
E. Disbursement&#13;
55.   As confirmed by the Government, the loan will be a LIBOR-based single-currency loan in&#13;
U.S. dollars up to an amount of US$42.0 million. The proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed&#13;
against eligible expenditures in the following percentages: 62 percent of expenditures against civil&#13;
works; 81 percent of local and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for materials, equipment and&#13;
vehicles; 90 percent of expenditures for housing materials; and 100 percent of expenditures for&#13;
consultants and training. The Bank will disburse against the Statement of Expenditures for all&#13;
contracts below the procurement prior review limit. Given the availability of a Special Account&#13;
(SA), the minimum withdrawal application for direct payment or special commitment from the&#13;
Loan Account would be 20 percent of the initial deposit to the SA. The Closing Date for this&#13;
Loan is September 30, 2001.&#13;
56.   The Government will establish a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The authorized allocation of the Special Account will be US$4.0 million to facilitate&#13;
disbursements for urgent emergency reconstruction needs. But the initial deposit will be limited&#13;
to US$2.0 million until the disbursed amount from the Loan Account has reached US$6.0 million.&#13;
The Special Account will be replenished by submitting monthly withdrawal applications to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
F. Retroactive Financing&#13;
57.   So that the Government will be able to undertake preventive works in a timely fashion, the&#13;
proposed emergency operation will finance retroactively up to US$8.0 million in expenditures&#13;
incurred before loan signing, but after July 1, 1997, the date of declaration of the El Ninio&#13;
emergency in Argentina.&#13;
G. Financial Managing and Auditing&#13;
58.   SUCCE has a defined financial management system (FMS) that meets the criteria&#13;
established by the Bank (OP/BP 10.02) that ensures the quality and timely delivery of all&#13;
information regarding project resources and expenditures (Appendix 13). Confirmation of the&#13;
FMS is assured because it is outlined in the POM, and the POM is a condition to effectiveness.&#13;
Audits of the special account of the project account of SUCCE and of the project accounts of the&#13;
participating provinces would be performed by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
under terms of reference that is also satisfactory to the Bank. The audit reports would be&#13;
delivered to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
project accounts would include separate opinions on, among others: (i) sources and uses of&#13;
account funds; and (ii) statement of expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
H. Reporting&#13;
59.   SUCCE and the SUPCEs would keep adequate records as detailed in the POM and as&#13;
established by the Bank's operational manual in terms of financial management and internal&#13;
control (Appendix 13). Successful implementation of project objectives also require intensive&#13;
monitoring of actual performance by both SUCCE and the Bank. To facilitate this supervision,&#13;
SUCCE will prepare for the Bank a progress report on project execution of such scope and detail&#13;
as the Bank shall reasonably request, no later than April 30, August 31, and December 31 of each&#13;
year, in parallel with the due date of the Flood Protection Project reports. The terms of reference&#13;
for these reports would be basically the same as that for the Flood Protection Project. SUCCE&#13;
would use the monitoring indicators described in paragraph 62 to evaluate the overall&#13;
performance of the project.&#13;
60.   Several lessons of experience from previous projects have been incorporated to streamline&#13;
project execution. To increase the cost-effectiveness of review of technical proposals and&#13;
procurement documents, thresholds for prior review by SUCCE and the Bank were carefully&#13;
reviewed during negotiations and will be included in the revised POM. The thresholds for prior&#13;
review were done so as to balance cost with risk and importance of quick contracting due to time&#13;
restraints in the nature of the emergency assistance loan. In addition, procedures for review of&#13;
procurement documents were streamlined, and all provinces will be required to use standard&#13;
procurement documents approved by the Bank, copies of which are to be included in the POM.&#13;
To improve subproject management, the POM will require that all subproject proposals contain a&#13;
timetable for all main stages of execution in an agreed format, as done so for the Flood Protection&#13;
Project. These timetables are expected to provide SUCCE with more reliable information,&#13;
thereby permitting more adequate projections needed to plan subproject review.&#13;
61.   Timely implementation depends on adequate financial resources being available when&#13;
needed and on good performance of the local implementation units (SUCCE, SUPCEs). For this&#13;
reason full supervision missions three months after the conclusion of each fiscal year (same as&#13;
calendar year) to review project progress and assess its implementation in each province will be&#13;
carried out. All three proposed review missions will be very important for assessing uncommitted&#13;
funds, reallocation of funds, lists of identified works for financing, and whether a province has&#13;
been affected by the El Niflo event, as determined by the established eligibility criteria. In&#13;
addition, partial supervision missions (at least two per year) will be carried out through the course&#13;
of project implementation to ensure that project advancement is continuing at a satisfactory pace.&#13;
Supervision inputs are shown in Appendix 12.&#13;
L Monitoring, Impact and Performance Indicators&#13;
62.   Two types of monitoring indicators were established to track the advancement of the&#13;
project implementation: impact and performance indicators. The impact indicators measure: (i)&#13;
the outcome of the project in terms of the population that benefited; (ii) the effectiveness of the&#13;
executed works by comparing the performance of the constructed defenses during the annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
flood period to their forecast performance; and (iii) the population attended by the housing&#13;
program and the rehabilitation of hospitals and health centers. Performance indicators are used to&#13;
measure the physical and institutional advancement of the project. These indicators are shown in&#13;
table 1 of Appendix 14.&#13;
J. Project Operational Manual&#13;
63.   The Project Operational Manual is a key implementation instrument for project success&#13;
and is a requirement for effectiveness. The new POM draws from the POMs of the Flood&#13;
Rehabilitation Project and Flood Protection Project. Appendix 10 highlights some of the main&#13;
topics to be covered in the POM.&#13;
IV. Agreements&#13;
64.   Effectiveness. To expedite the project initiation, the Federal Government and the&#13;
participating provinces have already completed several important steps in the identification of&#13;
works to be executed. It was agreed that the following would be conditions of effectiveness: (i)&#13;
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement has been executed on behalf of the Borrower and at least one&#13;
participating province; (ii) a SUPCE, as set forth in the POM, must be operational in a province&#13;
which has satisfactorily entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement; (iii) all action has been taken,&#13;
by each participating province that has in effect a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, to permit that the&#13;
procurement procedures to be financed by the Loan be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
provisions set forth in the Loan Agreement and POM; and (iv) that the POM has been issued by&#13;
SAFP and is in effect.&#13;
65.   AdditionalAgreements. It was also agreed: (i) that the Bank would receive every four&#13;
months a progress report on the project; (ii) in April 1999, there would be the first mid-term&#13;
review of the project; and (iii) estimated amounts that may be onlent to provinces would be&#13;
stipulated in the POM and not in the Loan Agreement and that such funds can be reallocated&#13;
under the circumstances outlined in the Loan Agreement. In addition, the Borrower's&#13;
procurement and consultant selection plans will be in the POM. The Bank team indicated that&#13;
Bank management would consider the possibility of a subsequent loan to address a comprehensive&#13;
flood protection project in the northwest region of Argentina, if a request were made.&#13;

El Nifio and Parana/Paraguay River Basin Flooding Correlation&#13;
The shifts in rainfall patterns in the tropical Pacific disturb atmospheric circulation patterns&#13;
all over the globe. Because the weather patterns associated with El Niflo events can persist for&#13;
about a year, the anomalous weather conditions that can be experienced in those regions affected&#13;
by the phenomenon can also be long-lasting. The table below shows the close correspondence&#13;
between El Ninlo events and the occurrence of extra-ordinary floods which occur in the littoral&#13;
provinces of Argentina.&#13;

FEN6MENO ENOS (EL NINO-OSCILACI6N DEL SUR)&#13;
INTRODUCCION&#13;
El fen6meno ENOS es una anomalia tanto atmosferica como oceanica en el Oceano Pacifico&#13;
Ecuatorial. En su fase calida esta caracterizada por el un extenso calentamiento en el Oceano&#13;
Pacifico Oriental que dura tres o mis estaciones. Acoplado con esta anomalia oceanica el&#13;
fen6meno Oscilaci6n del Sur es una amplia oscilaci6n interanual en la presi6n atmosferica de una&#13;
regi6n cercana al Norte de Australia y una en el Pacifico Central. El fen6meno ENOS constituye&#13;
la mayor variaci6n climatica de corto plazo y ha sido estudiada desde principios de siglo. La&#13;
Figura 1 da una descripci6n abreviada de las principales caracteristicas de este fenomeno.&#13;
El fen6meno ENOS de los anios 82-83, el mayor del siglo, fue tambien ampliamente observado&#13;
por medio de informaci6n satelitaria y de boyas oceanicas (National Research Council, 1994).&#13;
IMPACTO DEL ENSO ENLA HIDROCLImAATOLOGiA DE REGIONES TROPICALES Y&#13;
EXTRA TROPICALES.&#13;
El impacto del fen6meno ENOS a nivel en el evento 82-83 ha sido cuantificado en 2000 muertos&#13;
y mas de $13.000 millones de dMlares en perdidas a nivel mundial. La Figura 2 da una indicaci6n&#13;
global del impacto de un episodio calido del fen6meno ENOS (NOAA, 1997).&#13;
IMPACTO DEL FENOMENO ENOS EN LA REPUBLICA ARGENTINA&#13;
El fen6meno ENOS, tanto en su fase calida como fria, produce un impacto importante en la&#13;
hidroclimatologia de varias regiones en la Republica Argentina.&#13;
CUENCAS DEL PARAN4, PARAGUAY Y URUGUAY&#13;
La cuenca de los rios Parana, Paraguay y Uruguay son grandemente afectadas por los episodios&#13;
calidos y frios del fen6meno ENOS. En los uiltimos afios crecidas en estos rios han causado dafios&#13;
por arriba de $1000 millones de d6lares en cada oportunidad. Existen varios estudios en los cuales&#13;
se puede evaluar el impacto en la hidrometeorologia de la zona sur del Brasil, Paraguay y&#13;
nordeste Argentino. Uno de ellos es el estudio de Anderson y otros (1994) en el cual se determina&#13;
que, bajo un criterio regional, los afios con episodios calidos del fen6meno ENOS. El criterio&#13;
regional es que se produce, al menos en una de las 10 estaciones fluviom6tricas de estas cuencas,&#13;
un evento con periodo de recurrencia superior a los 10 afios.&#13;
Para ilustrar el impacto en los caudales de los rios de esta cuenca se realiz6 un estudio de las&#13;
probabilidades de excedencia de los caudales estacionales (tres meses: Diciembre-Febrero,&#13;
Marzo-Mayo, Junio-Agosto y Septiembre-Noviembre) del rio Parana en Corrientes, despues de la&#13;
confluencia con el rio Paraguay. El resultado de este analisis se presenta en la Figura 3. Este&#13;
analisis se hizo teniendo en cuenta que existe un episodio calido del ENOS durante la estaci6n&#13;
Diciembre 97-Febrero 98 y nide el impacto en los caudales en la misma estacion (DEF) hasta 3&#13;
estaciones de adelanto (SON). De la observaci6n de la misma se pueden hacer los siguientes&#13;
comentarios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
* Las probabilidades de excedencia de los caudales medios estacionales disminuyen durante&#13;
episodios calidos del fen6meno ENOS, es decir los caudales altos se hacen mas probables para&#13;
la misma estaci6n (Diciembre 97-Febrero 98), la estaci6n siguiente (Marzo-Mayo 98) y&#13;
continua por las otras dos estaciones.&#13;
* Debe recalcarse que las diferencias entre las probabilidades de excedencia de eventos calidos y&#13;
los otros se incrementan considerablemente para las probabilidades extremas.&#13;
Una forma altemativa es la de presentar las probabilidades de caudales por arriba de la normal&#13;
como una funci6n de episodios calidos y frios del fen6meno ENOS. Aunque esta es una&#13;
representaci6n mas simple requiere la definici6n a priori de que es un episodio por arriba o por&#13;
debajo de la normal de los caudales. Los resultados se presentan en la Figura 4. En este caso se&#13;
puede ver que la probabilidad de caudales por arriba de la normal se incrementan a cerca de un&#13;
50% para episodios calidos del fen6meno ENOS.&#13;
CUENCAS DEL NOR-OESTEARGENTINO&#13;
De acuerdo a la informaci6n disponible se hizo un analisis de los caudales medios estacionales del&#13;
rio Bermejo en Puerto Bermejo presentandose los resultados en las Figuras 5 y 6. Del analisis de&#13;
las curvas de excedencia de probabilidades se puede observar una correlaci6n positiva, es decir&#13;
episodios calidos hacen valores extremos mas probables en el rio Bermejo aunque las diferencias&#13;
no son tan marcadas como en el caso del rio Parani. Episodios calidos bajan ligeramente su&#13;
probabilidad a dos estaciones de adelanto en la Figura , poniendose alrededor del 30% notandose&#13;
un aumento significativo de la probabilidad de caudales normales (alrededor del 55%).&#13;
CUENCAS DE CUYO&#13;
Un analisis similar se llev6 a cabo en la cuenca del rio Atuel, en la provincia de Mendoza, como&#13;
una cuenca representativa de la zona de Cuyo. Los resultados se presentan en las Figuras 7 y 8.&#13;
Las curvas de excedencias marcan una correlaci6n positiva entre eventos calidos y la probabilidad&#13;
de caudales extremos, particularmente en los caudales de verano de la misma estaci6n (DEF).&#13;
Las probabilidades de eventos normales y humedos aumentan a valores parecidos, alrededor de&#13;
40% mientras que la probabilidad de eventos secos disminuye a aproximadamente el 18%.&#13;
PRONOSTICO DEL FENOMENO ENOS PARA EL VERANO 1997-98 Y OTONO 1998&#13;
INTRODUCCION&#13;
El corriente episodio calido del fen6meno ENOS tiene caracteristicas singulares con respecto a&#13;
los episodios anteriores, en cuanto a su intensidad y a su fecha de inicio. La Figura 9 hace una&#13;
comparaci6n de varios episodios calidos donde se puede observar la intensidad y la prematura&#13;
fecha de inicio del episodio actual (NOAA-CIRES, 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
Existe una considerable variedad de informaci6n sobre el corriente episodio calido del fen6meno&#13;
ENOS, tanto en mediciones de la situaci6n actual como en pron6sticos de su comportamiento en&#13;
el aiio 1998.&#13;
PRONOSTICOS DEL FENMENO ENOS&#13;
La mayoria de los pron6sticos del corriente episodio calido del fen6meno ENOS indican que las&#13;
temperaturas por arriba de la normal continuaran en el periodo Enero-Mayo 1998, produciendose&#13;
un descenso de las temperaturas hasta Ilegar a temperaturas por debajo de la normal a mediados&#13;
del anio 1998. Como ilustraci6n se presentan varios pron6sticos individuales de las temperaturas&#13;
promedios de la superficie del mar en la zona Nifno 3 provenientes del National Weather Service&#13;
de los EEUU (Figura 10), del Bureau of Meteorology Research Center (BMRC) (Figura 11) y&#13;
del Center for Ocean, Land and Atmosphere Studies (COLA) (Figura 12). Debe recalcarse que&#13;
algunos de estos pron6sticos solo se dan como valores experimentales por las agencias y se&#13;
-presentan en este informe para ilustrar las posibilidades de los modelos de pronostico del&#13;
fen6meno ENOS.&#13;
Tambien se incluyen los pron6sticos del National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)&#13;
que da las temperaturas medias del mar para diferentes estaciones del aflo 1998 (Figura 13). En&#13;
todas estas figuras se puede apreciar la disminuci6n de la intensidad del episodio calido a&#13;
mediados del afno 1998. Finalmente el International Research Institute lleva a cabo combinaciones&#13;
de pron6sticos basados en el exito de pron6sticos anteriores (Figura 14). Como un ejemplo se da&#13;
el pron6stico combinado para el invierno, en el Hemisferio Sur, de las temperaturas medias del&#13;
Oceano Pacifico Tropical donde se puede ver, una vez mas, que el fen6meno esta entrando en una&#13;
fase fria.&#13;
PRONOSTICOS DEL IMPACTO DEL EPisoDIo ACTUAL DEL FEN6MENO ENOS ENSUR AMERIcA&#13;
El International Research Institute ha hecho unos pronosticos experimentales del impacto del&#13;
episodio corriente del fen6meno ENOS para los periodos Octubre-Diciembre 1997 y Enero-&#13;
Marzo 1998. Estos pron6sticos se presentan en las Figuras 15 y 16. Para la Repuiblica Argentina,&#13;
y en particular para la regi6n de la cuenca de los rios Parana, Paraguay y Uruguay, para el periodo&#13;
Octubre-Diciembre 1997 la probabilidad de precipitaciones por arriba de la normal estan en el&#13;
55% mientras que la probabilidad de precipitaciones por debajo de la normal solo es del 15%.&#13;
Para el periodo Enero-Marzo 1998 la probabilidad de precipitaciones por arriba de la normal esta&#13;
entre el 55% y el 45% para las regiones de las cuencas mencionadas.&#13;
Un analisis similar al caso de la cuenca del rio Parana se realizo para la zona del Nor-Oeste&#13;
Argentino. De la observaci6n de la Figura 15 (Octubre-Diciembre 1997) se puede ver que las&#13;
probabilidades de precipitaciones por debajo de la normal son superiores en la parte occidental del&#13;
NOA mientras que las probabilidades de precipitaciones por arriba de la normal son superiores en&#13;
la parte oriental de la regi6n.&#13;
Para el periodo siguiente (Enero-Marzo 1997, Figura 16) se puede observar que la zona de&#13;
interes esta generalmente afectada negativamente por episodios calidos, es decir las&#13;
probabilidades de precipitaciones por debajo de la normal estAn en un 60% para un sector de la&#13;
regi6n NOA, en un 35% para otro y en un 20% para otro.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

El nivel de detalle de la informaci6n no permite hacer conclusiones con respecto a la zona del rio&#13;
Atuel.&#13;
COMENTARIOS FINALES SOBRE EL IMPACTO DEL FENOMENO ENSO EN LA&#13;
REPiJBLICA ARGENTINA&#13;
Este informe es un estudio preliminar y obviamente debe ser ampliado utilizando datos adicionales&#13;
de precipitaci6n y escorrentia en las zonas de interes. Debe enfatizarse, sin embargo, que la&#13;
confiabilidad de los pron6sticos del fen6meno ENOS, que Ilegan hasta 15 meses de adelanto,&#13;
tienen valor predictivo y pueden ser utilizados en pron6sticos hidroclimaticos, ver por ejemplo Liu&#13;
y otros (1997ab).&#13;

Course of Actions Taken by Central and Local Governments&#13;
In June of 1997, selected members of SUCCE and a Bank representative were lead by Dr.&#13;
Juan Valdes to key sites of flood defense structures and to US Army Corps of Engineers district&#13;
and division offices throughout the Mississippi Valley Basin and in Washington, DC The tour&#13;
encompassed exposure to both structural and non-structural measures taken by different US&#13;
Government agencies in regards to flood protection efforts.&#13;
In the littoral provinces several events have transpired. In late August of 1997, the First&#13;
Seminar on Hydro-meterology in the Plata Basin (Primer Encuentro de Hidrometereologia de la&#13;
Cuenca Plata) took place in the province of Chaco, where delegates (involved in, among others,&#13;
the SUPCEs and civil defense) from the all of the littoral provinces and those from the central&#13;
level (SUCCE, National Civil Defense, Secretary of Social Development of the President of the&#13;
Nation, Ministry of the Environment and others) were present. During the seminar, the El Nifio&#13;
phenomenon was analyzed in terms of its forecast and impacts for the remainder of 1997 and the&#13;
beginning months of 1998, and what preventive actions should be addressed in terms of structural&#13;
and non-structural measures.&#13;
On October 2, 1997, SUCCE held a meeting with the littoral provinces to analyze the&#13;
functioning of the hydraulic alert system (flood forecasting) which was implemented under the&#13;
Flood Rehabilitation Project. In addition, actions were agreed to for the short-term adjustment&#13;
and actualization of the communication system with the provinces, including the acquisition of&#13;
necessary supplemental goods. In the long-term, actions were agreed to modernize the system on&#13;
a regional scale. This meeting was followed up with a second meeting on October 23, 1997,&#13;
where the necessities for the system were finalized and a commission, consisting of&#13;
representatives from the provinces, SUCCE and the Institute for water and the Environment, was&#13;
created&#13;
November 3, 1997, marked the meeting with in the Secretary of Public Works of the&#13;
Ministry of Economics and Works and Public Services of the Nation with the participation of the&#13;
distinctive national entities (including SUCCE) where they discussed the problems that the&#13;
phenomenon presents and the already occurring floodings in the country. In the mentioned&#13;
meeting, it was determined that the speaker of the National Government with provinces will be&#13;
the Minister of the Interior, which will channel the demands referred to the management and&#13;
obtaining of resources to the Ministry of Economics.&#13;
November 6, 1997, SUCCE and the SUPCEs participated in a meeting held at the&#13;
Facultad de Ingenieria de la Universidad de BuenosAires. The participants analyzed the El&#13;
Nifio phenomenon at: both a global and local scale; its impact on the agrarian activities in the&#13;
region; the implemented hydraulic alert system (flood warning) in the littoral region; and what&#13;
structural and non-structural actions are to be undertaken in the region through the Flood&#13;
Protection Project.&#13;
From November 26 to 27, 1997, in the city of Salta, a meeting was held between the&#13;
northwestern provincial authorities and distinct national authorities to analyze the impact of the El&#13;
Niuo phenomenon in the northwestern region. December 11-12, 1997, members of SUCCE and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
four SUPCEs attended a workshop in Montevideo, UIruguay in regards to the forecast of the El&#13;
Nifio event and its possible economic implications in southern South America.&#13;

Project Description Outline&#13;
Northwestern Provinces Component.&#13;
(i)   Protection phase for: Acquiring of goods and execution of works for emergency&#13;
river flood control (including riverbed cleaning, levee and embankment strengthening, and&#13;
other river protection measures) and protection of infrastructure, such as bridges, health&#13;
centers, and schools.&#13;
(ii)   The rehabilitation phase for: Given that the full impact of El Niflo cannot be&#13;
ascertained until the first few months of 1998, it is not possible to define this phase&#13;
completely at this time. The eligibility of financing for any reconstruction activities would&#13;
be contingent on damages sustained from El Niffo-related phenomena. Subproject&#13;
categories include: (a) transport infrastructure; (b) drainage systems; (c) health and&#13;
education facilities; (d) water supply and sewerage; and (e) river dredging, defenses and&#13;
embankments. Investment subprojects to be financed under the reconstruction phase&#13;
would have to meet eligibility criteria agreed upon with the Government.&#13;
(iii)  Technical assistance: This phase would finance: the establishment of the&#13;
SUPCEs in the northwestern provinces for an estimated 1,500 man-months for three&#13;
years; equipment for civil defense coordination, training, and flood forecasting; regional&#13;
environmental studies, integrated with a regional flood-risk mapping; and detailed&#13;
engineering studies for works and inspection of such works during execution.&#13;
(iv)   Housing: Reconstruction of housing would be administered on homes destroyed&#13;
or severely damaged would be supported through a program of grants and self-help work.&#13;
About 300 low-income families would be able to rebuild their homes. Vouchers would be&#13;
offered to cover the cost of obtaining materials (about US$6,200 per home). The&#13;
eligibility criteria and the framework to implement this subcomponent would be the same&#13;
as that used successfully in the Flood Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
II.   Littoral Provinces Component.&#13;
(i)    The rehabilitation phase: Rehabilitation would be contingent on damages&#13;
sustained from El Ninlo-related phenomena. Subprojects along the Uruguay River have&#13;
been identified, including: (a) drainage systems; (b) education and health facilities; and (c)&#13;
river dredging, defenses, and embankments. Investment subprojects to be financed under&#13;
the reconstruction phase would have to meet eligibility criteria agreed with the&#13;
Government.&#13;
(ii)   The project would finance the engineering and supervision of the rehabilitation&#13;
works would be financed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
III.  Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
(i)    This phase would strengthen SUCCE's administrative and technical capacity to&#13;
coordinate implementation of the project for an estimated 100 man-months. SUCCE will&#13;
be required to carry out annual audits of project accounts.&#13;

Guidelines for Terms of Reference for Consultants to Undertake a Regional Flood-&#13;
risk Zoning of the Northwestern Provinces&#13;
LINEAMIENTOS GENERALES PARA TERMINOS DE REFERENCIA&#13;
El prop6sito de esta secci6n es la definici6n de algunos criterios para la determinaci6n de los&#13;
terminos de referencia de estudios para la determinacion de mapas de zonas de riesgo para las&#13;
provincias del noroeste de Argentina. Estos mapas de zonas de riesgo permitiran una mejor&#13;
prestaci6n de los prestamos de emergencia.&#13;
Es importante recalcar que, sin la definici6n de las zonas de riesgo, es imposible estimar las&#13;
caracteristicas y las frecuencias de eventos extremos. La experiencia de las inundaciones del&#13;
Medio Oeste en los EEUU en el afio 1993 indican la dificultad de evaluar el periodo de retorno de&#13;
una inundaci6n en una regi6n. Por ejemplo la recurrencia de la crecida del 1993 fue de 50 afios en&#13;
St. Paul (Minnesota), menos de 100 afnos en Lincoln (Nebraska) a mas de 100 affos en St. Louis&#13;
(Missouri). De mas de 500 estaciones hidrometricas del US Geological Survey en la zona del alto&#13;
Mississippi, 45 estaciones excedieron el nivel de recurrencia de 100 aflos pero al menos 450 no lo&#13;
hicieron (Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee, 1994). Solo sectores del&#13;
Mississippi Superior y del Missouri alcanzaron un periodo de recurrencia de 500 afios.&#13;
La deterniinaci6n de las zonas de riesgo debe ser mas completa que la determinaci6n de la linea de&#13;
la creciente de 100-afnos, mas apropiadamente Ilamada la creciente con una probabilidad de&#13;
ocurrencia de 1% en cada afno ("one-percent standard", Lord, 1994). Generalmente, al menos en&#13;
los EEUU, los usuarios localizados en la planicie de inundaci6n debajo de la linea del 1% tienden&#13;
a creer, err6neamente, que el riesgo es el mnismo en cualquier sitio de la planicie. Un ejemplo de la&#13;
determinaci6n de mapas de zonas de riesgo de inundaci6n en zonas semi-aridas, como las del&#13;
noroeste Argentino, puede verse en Marco (1994). En ese estudio las zonas de riesgo fueron&#13;
clasificadas en las siguientes categorias: zonas de inundaci6n masiva; conos aluviales, desaparici6n&#13;
de cauces efimeros; cuencas cerradas y zonas muy concentradas de escasa area pero de alta&#13;
probabilidad de inundaci6n ('black spots"). En este estudio se demostr6 que la mayor parte del&#13;
problema es urbano y se debi6 al crecimiento desordenado cuyas consecuencias fueron&#13;
remediadas con medidas estructurales. En el estudio se determin6 que el 80% de las medidas&#13;
estructurales podrian haberse evitado si se hubiera llevado a cabo una zonificaci6n adecuada de la&#13;
planicie de inundaci6n.&#13;
INCERTIDUMBRES EN LA DETERMINA CIONDE LAS ZONAS DE RIESGO&#13;
En la determinaci6n de las zonas de riesgo deben tenerse en cuenta las incertidumbres en la&#13;
determinaci6n de la magnitud de las crecientes y su extensi6n areal. Esto no es habitualmente&#13;
mostrado en los planos de riesgo de inundaciones. Por ejemplo estimaciones de la creciente con&#13;
un periodo de retorno de 100 aflos puede tener una variaci6n de un 5% a un 45% (Burkham,&#13;
1978). Esta incertidumbre aumenta notablemente para la definici6n de crecientes con un mayor&#13;
periodo de recurrencia.&#13;
Una incertidumbre adicional es la transformaci6n de una creciente en su equivalente nivel. Esto se&#13;
hace habitualmente por intermedio de una curva de altura-caudal o por medio de un modelo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
hidraulico. En el estudio del Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee (1994) se&#13;
citan errores del orden de 0.2 a 2 pies. Adicionalmente existe la imperfecci6n de los mapas&#13;
topograficos. En el estudio mencionado se estima que la definici6n del nivel de la linea de la&#13;
creciente de 100 afios puede tener una variaci6n promedio del 23% con respecto al valor&#13;
estimado.&#13;
SELECCIONDE UNNI VEL DE FRECUENCIA PARA PRtSTAMOS DE EMERGENCIA&#13;
Dada la alta variabilidad espacial del periodo de retomo de un fen6meno de inundaciones es dificil&#13;
la selecci6n de un valor regional de frecuencia y debe seleccionarse un valor puntual para la&#13;
determinaci6n de la adjudicacion de un prestamo de emergencia.&#13;
El caudal de disefio de una obra hidraulica para control o atenuaci6n de crecidas depende de las&#13;
caracteristicas de la obra. Existen tres criterios para la selecci6n de este nivel (Chow y otros,&#13;
1988):&#13;
*  Criterio empirico: se adjudica un determinado periodo de recurrencia basado totalmente en la&#13;
probabilidad de excedencia. Por ejemplo generalmente se diseflan puentes en caminos&#13;
secundarios con un periodo de recurrencia entre 10-50 afios y en carreteras principales con un&#13;
periodo de retorno entre 50 y 100 afios.&#13;
&#149;  Criterio de riesgo: es una extension del criterio empirico donde la probabilidad de excedencia&#13;
durante la vida uitil del proyecto es tenida en cuenta, es decir R = (1 - I/T)r donde T es el&#13;
periodo de retorno y n es el numero de aflos en la vida util del proyecto. A este valor se lo&#13;
modifica con un factor de seguridad.&#13;
*  Analisis hidro-econ6mico: en este estudio se determina el periodo 6ptimo de disefio en base al&#13;
caracter probabilistico de las crecidas y al impacto econ6mico de las mismas sobre el rango&#13;
factible de eventos hidrologicos.&#13;
Dada la escasa informaci6n que se estima esta disponible se recomienda que en esta fase del&#13;
proyecto se adopten criterios basados totalmente en la frecuencia. Se recomienda, por lo tanto,&#13;
una creciente de disefno de 50 afios en el sitio como el umbral a partir del cual se aprobara el uso&#13;
de los fondos de emergencia. Este periodo de recurrencia es lo suficientemente alto para justificar&#13;
reparaciones mayores al sistema de drenaje, comunicaciones, etc de la regi6n pero al mismo&#13;
tiempo con una frecuencia de ocurrencia alta (riesgo de 55% en un periodo de 30 afios). La&#13;
mayoria de las obras principales de infraestructura se disefian con un periodo igual o mayor a 50&#13;
afios.&#13;
Como criterio adicional para la adjudicaci6n de los prestamos de emergencia se puede adoptar un&#13;
criterio de cobertura espacial de la emergencia, por ejemplo si en un departamento o provincia&#13;
esta afectada en mas del 75% de su superficie se puede considerar al departamento o provincia&#13;
ccen emergencia" y autorizar el reembolso de los prestamos de emergencia.&#13;

Appendix 10&#13;
Project Operational Manual (POM)&#13;
To facilitate project implementation, a Project Operational Manual based on the revised&#13;
POM from the Flood Protection Project will be used. Lessons learned during the implementation&#13;
of the two ongoing flood projects would be incorporated into the new POM. Among other&#13;
aspects, the POM includes: (i) eligibility for protection works and indicators that trigger eligibility&#13;
for rehabilitation; (ii) procurement procedures; (iii) housing grant procedures; (iv) provincial fund&#13;
allocation and reallocation guidelines; (v) disbursement procedures; (vi) SUCCE structure and&#13;
responsibilities; (vii) structure and responsibilities of each SUPCE; and (viii) project monitoring&#13;
and auditing.&#13;
Eligibility indicators: The POM includes a list of types of infrastructure that will be&#13;
eligible for Bank financing for the protection phase in the northwestern component of the project.&#13;
Also, guidelines will be established on where the best location for such protection investments&#13;
should be made. The POM will also include a set of criteria that must be met that signal that a&#13;
significant weather event has taken place and that the resulting damaged occurred was from the&#13;
excessive rainfall endured in the region and that rehabilitation may commence.&#13;
Procurement procedures: The POM will include a detailed set of instructions to the&#13;
implementation agencies (SUPCEs) to apply adequately the procurement procedures based on the&#13;
Bank Guidelines for procurement of goods and works as well as for selection of consultants. The&#13;
POM includes also the agreed procedures for NCB, shopping and direct contracting. The POM&#13;
will also include arrangements for SUCCE supervision of procurement actions and review of&#13;
bidding documents. The agreed standard bidding documents for all procurement of goods and&#13;
works are to be annexed in the POM.&#13;
Housing grant procedures: The POM will describe in detail the agreed criteria and&#13;
procedures for eligibility for the housing grant, as well as procedures to be followed by the&#13;
SUPCEs to distribute and control the vouchers and to help the beneficiaries to construct their&#13;
houses. These are the same guidelines and criteria established in the Flood Protection Project.&#13;
Fund allocation: The POM will include, based on identified investments during project&#13;
preparation, the amount of funds initially allocated to each province. The POM will also establish&#13;
the guidelines and timetables for fund reallocation.&#13;
Disbursement procedures: The POM will include details in the procedures to be followed&#13;
by the SUPCEs to disburse from special accounts. They are based on the Bank disbursement&#13;
procedures and based on experience gained during the implementation of the previous projects.&#13;
The POM will also include the arrangements for SUCCE control and supervision of disbursement&#13;
activities by the SUPCEs.&#13;
SUCCE structure and responsibilities: The POM will define SUCCE as a group of&#13;
consultants funded by the loan proceeds of the Flood Protection Project and by the El Nifio&#13;
Emergency Flood Project for the supplementary staff required to administer and implement the&#13;
additional work load brought on by the northwestern component. SUCCE will continue to report&#13;
to the UEC of the SAFP. SUCCE will be headed by an executive chief and will be composed of&#13;
professionals in each sector of project implementation, having as a minimum: (i) project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
supervisor, reporting directly to the SAFP and to the Bank; (ii) an accounting expert; (iii) a&#13;
disbursement expert; (iv) a procurement expert; (v) an environmental expert; (vi) a flood defense&#13;
expert; (vii) a civil engineering expert; (viii) a hydrologist; (ix) a housing expert; (x) an expert for&#13;
shelters and civil defense actions; (xi) a drainage expert; (xii) a counsel; (xiii) an advisor for sub-&#13;
project evaluations; and (xiv) support for administrative, computational, accounting, technical and&#13;
disbursement activities. All new and existing professionals in SUCCE will be hired having terms&#13;
of references (TOR) and the selection process shall be presented to the Bank. The POM will&#13;
define as SUCCE's responsibility to oversee, supervise and control the actions of all SUPCEs,&#13;
particularly in respect to identification of works to be selected for investment, sub-project design,&#13;
procurement actions, implementation, supervision, disbursement, accounting and auditing.&#13;
Structure and responsibility of each SUPCE: Each participating province will assign&#13;
project implementation responsibility to a local SUCCE, as done in the ongoing Flood Protection&#13;
Project. The SUPCE will consist of a chief executive reporting to a provincial minister or directly&#13;
to the governor (in some provinces), and will have experts in a similar structure to that of&#13;
SUCCE. Proceeds from the loan will finance the SUPCE staff for the six provinces identified in&#13;
the northwestern component for three years. The POM establishes the arrangements for the&#13;
adequate control and relationship between SUCCE and the SUPCEs.&#13;
Project monitoring and auditing: The POM will establish the accounting requirements to&#13;
be followed by each SUPCE and by SUCCE. The monitoring system, especially the quarterly&#13;
reports to be sent to the Bank, would follow the same standard and content as those used in the&#13;
two other flood projects and would follow the project monitoring and performance indicators&#13;
agreed to in the POM. External independent auditors will be hired by SUCCE to audit annually&#13;
all project accounts, disbursement, procurement actions and SOEs and the use of the special&#13;
account. The TOR for the auditing services will be included in an annex to the POM.&#13;
Guidance to contractors on environmental aspects: The POM will include an annex, as in&#13;
the Flood Protection Project POM, giving guidance to contractors on procedures to be followed&#13;
during the execution of works to minimize environmental effects.&#13;

Appendix 13&#13;
Financial Management System&#13;
SUCCE, as defined by projects financed by the Bank, will maintain a financial&#13;
management system (FMS), as in the past and as defined in the POM. The FMS will encompass&#13;
accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems, adequate to ensure that SUCCE can provide&#13;
to the Bank accurate and timely information regarding project resources and expenditures.&#13;
Accounting: The information submitted to the Bank by SUCCE will adhere to accounting&#13;
standards acceptable to the Bank. Since SUCCE has been implementing Bank projects for over&#13;
five years, it already has an established accounting and internal control system that conforms with&#13;
such accounting standards that (i) reliably record and report all assets and liabilities and financial&#13;
transactions involving the use of Bank funds; and (ii) provide sufficient financial information for&#13;
managing and monitoring project activities.&#13;
Financial Reporting: SUCCE, as governed by the legal agreements and POM, will be&#13;
required to submit to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year (including the&#13;
fiscal year of the final disbursement) an audited financial statement of the project. The Bank will&#13;
also require that SUCCE have audited financial statements of any sub-borrower's implementing&#13;
agency (SUPCEs), since its financial viability is essential to project success and because one of the&#13;
project objectives are to improve institutional capability. In addition, SUCCE may need to submit&#13;
interim an audited statements used for project managing and monitoring purposes.&#13;
Auditing: SUCCE will have itself and the provincial implementing agencies financial&#13;
statements (including the Special Account and statement of expenditures) audited each year in&#13;
accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank as defined by the POM. The audit of such&#13;
financial statements will include: (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal&#13;
control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and ensure safe custody&#13;
of project financed assets; (ii) a determination as to whether the Borrower and project&#13;
implementing entities have maintained adequate documentation on all relevant transactions; (iii)&#13;
verification that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing, and identification of&#13;
any ineligible expenditures; and (iv) the summary of Special Account (SA) activities and a&#13;
summary of statement of expenditure (SOE) disbursements. The SA and SOEs are to be&#13;
addresses separately by the auditor's opinion. SUCCE will ensure that an independent auditor,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, is contracted in sufficient time to carry out the required responsibilities,&#13;
including a review of the FMS at the beginning of project implementation.&#13;
Quality of Staff: To be able to monitor the accounts and prepare the required financial&#13;
statements for the proposed project, SUCCE and the other project implementing entities will have&#13;
available an adequate number and mix of skilled and experienced staff who understand the&#13;
relevant accounting concepts and government regulations, as mandated in the POM (Appendix 6)&#13;
as part of the SUCCE staff requirement. The staff that uphold the required internal control&#13;
system will maintain that financial records are reliable and complete and adhere to management&#13;
policies and proper recording and safeguarding of assets and resources.&#13;
Failure to Submit Acceptable Audited Financial Statements: If: (i) failure to submit&#13;
required audited financial statements by the due date; (ii) the auditor's opinion indicates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
deficiencies in the accounting and internal controls (including ineligible expenditures) or in the&#13;
reliability of the financial statements; or (iii) the Bank considers the scope or quality of the audit&#13;
to be unacceptable, the Bank may take the following actions until acceptable audited financial&#13;
statements are received or a remedial action plan is agreed: (i) discontinues use of the SOE&#13;
procedure; (ii) replenishment of SA; (iii) suspension on all loan disbursements. These actions&#13;
would be taken by the Bank until adequate actions have been carried out by the Botrower.&#13;

            Argentina - El Nino Emergency Flood Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the El Nino Emergency
            Flood Project is to offset the damaging impact of El Nino
            in: i) six northwestern provinces and three Cuyo provinces;
            and ii) seven littoral provinces through additional works
            above and beyond the Flood Protection Project.  The project
            has been designed with two geographical components: one for
            the six northwestern provinces and the three Cuyo provinces,
            and another for the seven participating littoral provinces.
            A third component is designed to strengthen the
            administrative and technical capacity to coordinate the
            implementation of the project.  The operation will be
            implemented in two phases: 1) a protection phase of 12
            months for the northwestern provinces, which includes
            acquiring of goods and execution of works for emergency
            river flood control; and b) a rehabilitation phase for both
            geographic regions, which includes transport infrastructure,
            drainage systems, education and health facilities.  In
            addition, there is a capacity-building subcomponent for the
            northwestern provinces to manage flood emergencies and a
            small scale housing subcomponent for housing reconstruction.
