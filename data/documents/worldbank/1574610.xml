            Giving user communities control over
            financial resources is a key feature of community-driven
            development. The World Bank-assisted Swajal project was one
            of the first major rural water and sanitation projects to
            shift from centralized procurement and transfer investment
            funds to user communities, enabling them to procure
            materials, services, and works by themselves, assisted by
            support organizations. The Swajal community contracting
            model and the lessons learned from it are described in this
            field note.
