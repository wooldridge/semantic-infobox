How to Accelerate Corporate and&#13;
Financial Sector Restructuring in East Asia&#13;
Stijn Claessens,   Resolving systemic banking and corporate distress is not easy. The large scale of the East Asian&#13;
Simeon             financial crisis has made the task even more daunting in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia,&#13;
Djaznkov, and&#13;
Daniela            and Thailand (figure 1). Two years into the process, bank and corporate restructuring is still a work in&#13;
Klinlgebiel        progress (Claessens, Djankov, and Klingebiel 1999). Governments should act to accelerate it. Besides&#13;
adopting common policy reforms-improving financial regulation and supervision, corporate&#13;
governance, and bankruptcy procedures-and shoring up banks' capital positions, governments&#13;
could take or facilitate three additional steps:&#13;

            How to accelerate corporate and financial
            sector restructuring in East Asia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Resolving systemic banking and corporate
            distress is not easy. The large scale of the East Asian
            financial crisis has made the task even more daunting in
            Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand.
            Two years into the process, bank and corporate restructuring
            is still a work in progress. Governments should act to
            accelerate it. Besides adopting common policy prescriptions
            - improving financial regulation, corporate governance, and
            bankruptcy procedures and shoring up banks' capital
            positions - governments could take three additional steps:
            Set up competitive, privately managed specialized funds, to
            hold nonperforming loans and depoliticize restructuring.
            Allow auctions as an alternative to negotiations, to speed
            debt restructuring. And allow employee ownership
            participation schemes, to reduce workers' resistance to
            changes in ownership.
