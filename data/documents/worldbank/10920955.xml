&#13;
The Human Development Division of EDI (EDIHD) conducted a training-of-trainers (TOT)&#13;
course on Health Sector Reform and Sustainable Finance in Shanghai, China, from June 1-&#13;
17, 1998. This was the first regional course adapted from the Health Flagship course held&#13;
earlier in Washington, D.C. (1997). Three modules from the Washington course, Modules 2,&#13;
3 and 4, were offered. The course focused on diagnostic approaches to assessing health&#13;
systems (Module 2), revenue sources and collection modalities (Module 3), and targeting&#13;
public subsidies for health (Module 4). Fifty-nine participants attended Module 2, 60&#13;
participated in Module 3, and 61 in Module 4. The participants consisted mainly of faculty&#13;
members from the China Network for Training and Research in Health Economics and&#13;
Finance, as well as local health administrators and graduate students from the Department&#13;
of Health Economics at Shanghai Medical University.&#13;
&#13;
The course evaluation was supported by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES). Results from end-&#13;
of-module (EOM) questionnaires were processed by the Shanghai Medical University, and&#13;
used in the evaluation. These questionnaires were completed by 45 respondents in Module 2&#13;
(76.3%), 43 respondents in Module 3 (71.7%), and 41 respondents in Module 4 (67.2%).&#13;
There were 20 women among the 45 respondents in Module 2 (44.4%), 23 among the 43&#13;
respondents in Module 3 (53.5%), and 20 among the 41 respondents in Module 4 (48.8%).&#13;
Thirty-seven respondents in Module 2 had previous training in health economics, 39 in&#13;
Module 3, and 34 in Module 4. The questionnaire used to evaluate each Module consisted of&#13;
2 parts. The first section asked respondents to rate the overall design and delivery of the&#13;
Module. The second section asked the level of respondents' knowledge about topics covered&#13;
in the Module, before and after completing the Module. A 6-point Likert type scale that&#13;
ranged from 1 = minimum to 6 = maximum was used to rate respondents for each question.&#13;
Following is a summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Results from all three Modules showed high respondent ratings on two key areas of&#13;
        the course performance. These were the relevancy of materials to current occupation&#13;
        and the overall use of respondents' time. Module 2 had the highest mean scores on&#13;
        these two indicators among all modules, 5.38 and 5.53, respectively. The ratings for&#13;
        the other two modules also exceeded 5.0 on a 6-point scale, 5.19 and 5.27 for Module&#13;
        3 and 5.02 and 5.29 for Module 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The course was designed to expose participants to knowledge and skills of both&#13;
        international and Chinese experts for each Module. The trainers of Module 2 received&#13;
        particularly favorable responses from respondents for their clarity in delivering their&#13;
        messages. The mean score for this indicator was 5.33 out of 6.0, the highest rating&#13;
        among all indicators for trainers. Respondents also gave high approval ratings to the&#13;
        Module 3 trainers for their ability to answer questions adequately and the level of their&#13;
        knowledge. Mean scores were both 5.21.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 knowledge. Mean scores were both 5.21.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lChina-specific cases were used in each module to enhance participants'&#13;
 understanding of issues. Respondents were asked whether the Chinese cases were&#13;
 relevant to the teaching objectives, and whether they contributed to respondents'&#13;
 understanding of the theories and methods. The mean scores for Module 4 were the&#13;
 highest among Modules, 4.84 and 4.86, respectively. Module 2 had the lowest ratings&#13;
 among the three Modules, 4.18 and 4.36 out of 6.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe lowest course performance indicator across modules was on the degree to which&#13;
 the topics were treated in sufficient depth. The mean scores on this indicator for&#13;
 Modules 2-4 were 4.33, 4.56, and 4.39, respectively, out of 6.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post knowledge assessment showed an overall increase in respondents&#13;
 knowledge among all modules and items. Module 4 had had particularly large gains.&#13;
 The pre-course ratings of Module 4 ranged between 2.82-3.63 and the post-course&#13;
 ranged between 4.63-5.15. The percentage gain was more than 64% on two key&#13;
 topics, the information required to analyze incidence in health and the mechanics of&#13;
 incidence analysis in health. Three other items had a percentage gain of over 50%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere was a significant variation in pre/post percentage gains among issues covered&#13;
 in Module 2. Issues on health system structural components had the highest pre-&#13;
 course rating, 4.11 out of 6.0. The percentage gain on this topic was 23.8%, the&#13;
 lowest gain in Module 2. The complexity of causes involving rational economic reform&#13;
 had the lowest pre-course rating of 3.18. The rating of this topic rose by 55% upon&#13;
 completion of the Module, to the highest post-course mean score in Module 2, 4.93.&#13;
 Module 3 had a relatively even distribution of percentage gains across issues, about&#13;
 30-40% across topics. The pre-course mean scores ranged between 3.24-3.83. The&#13;
 post-course range was 4.74-5.05.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were three limitations to the evaluation. First, the data file of the original EOM&#13;
 questionnaire was kept in China and was not available for the evaluation. Therefore,&#13;
 results were not analyzed by detailed demographic / professional categories. Second,&#13;
 the information obtained from pre/post knowledge assessment reflects the degree to&#13;
 which respondents believed they learned the topics, but does not measure how much&#13;
 they actually learned. Third, the 6-point measurement scale lacks a mid-point, and&#13;
 thus the results may not be reliable. The use of 5-point scale with both a mid-point&#13;
 category and a "no answer" option is suggested for the future courses.&#13;
