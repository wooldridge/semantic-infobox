sector has failed--the list is long here too--&#13;
there is a clear role for government interven-&#13;

            Somalia has lacked a recognized
            government since 1991-an unusually long time. In extremely
            difficult conditions the private sector has demonstrated its
            much-vaunted capability to make do. To cope with the absence
            of the rule of law, private enterprises have been using
            foreign jurisdictions or institutions to help with some
            tasks, operating within networks of trust to strengthen
            property rights, and simplifying transactions until they
            require neither. Somalia's private sector experience
            suggests that it may be easier than is commonly thought for
            basic systems of finance and some infrastructure services to
            function where government is extremely weak or absent.
