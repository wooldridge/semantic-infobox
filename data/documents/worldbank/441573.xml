The Impact of IPPs in Developing&#13;
Countries Out of the Crisis and&#13;
into the Future&#13;
Y'vesAlboui' anzd    Developing countries started opening their power sectors to independent power producers (IPPs)&#13;
Redla Bousba      some ten years ago, and IPPs have now developed into a large market. This Note examines&#13;
several contentious questions relating to the development of this market: Has risk been&#13;
transferred to the private sector, or have IPPs contributed to an increase in government&#13;
liabilities? Have IPPs contributed to an increase in foreign exchange exposure? Are pricing and&#13;
investment decisions efficient? Have IPPs contributed to sector modernization? Answering these&#13;
questions has become more pressing with the global financial crisis. The Note concludes that on&#13;
the whole IPPs have had a positive development impact. But negative effects become significant&#13;
when the IPP program quickly grows to a large size relative to the host grid capacity, as has&#13;
happened in a few Asian countries.&#13;

            The impact of IPPs in developing countries
            : out of the crisis and into the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Developing countries started opening
            their power sectors to independent power producers (IPPs)
            some ten years ago, and IPPs have now developed into a large
            market. This Note examines several contentious questions
            relating to the developing of this market: Has risk been
            transferred to the private sector, or have IPPs contributed
            to an increase in government liabilities? Have IPPs
            contributed an increase in foreign exchange exposure? Are
            pricing and investment decisions efficient? Have IPPs
            contributed to sector modernization? Answering these
            questions has become more pressing with the global financial
            crisis. The Note concludes that on the whole IPPs have had a
            positive development impact. But negative effects become
            significant when the IPP program quickly grows to a large
            size relative to the host grid capacity, as has happened in
            a few Asian countries.
