Mr.Heinz Vergin,&#13;
Director, India Department,&#13;
The World Bank,&#13;
Washington, D.C.20433&#13;
USA.&#13;
Sub:Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project Policy&#13;
and Institutional Reforms.&#13;
I am pleased to confirm Government of Tamil Nadu's keen&#13;
interest in improving the management of the water sector and the&#13;
productivity of irrigated agriculture, and the commitment that we&#13;
place on achieving this with assistance of the Water Resources&#13;
Consolidation Project (WRCP).&#13;
Tamil Nadu's Water resources are scarce and the state's&#13;
future   development  will  depend  on  the  best  planning   and&#13;
allocation of water between sectors and efficient use by the main&#13;
sectoral users, especially agriculture. Comprehensive planning&#13;
of water use on a river basin basis and across sectors is&#13;
required.    For  agriculture,  the  state's  main  water   user,&#13;
productivity  from  irrigation must be  increased.   The  state's&#13;
objective is to increase yields and production of food grains and&#13;
increase production of high value diversification crops so as to&#13;
improve incomes in rural areas and assure production of food&#13;
staples, while ensuring sound environmental management and the&#13;
growing water needs of non-agricultural users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
To achieve these aims, GOTN has embarked upon a vigorous&#13;
programme to create a specialist water and irrigation agency for&#13;
the state and to adjust policies associated with water planning&#13;
and allocation. Under the WRCP the actions already undertaken&#13;
will be further followed up. Summarised below in two attachments&#13;
is a listing of actions already undertaken in preparation for the&#13;
WRCP (Attachment I), followed by a listing in matrix form of&#13;
additional actions intended to consolidate these reforms with&#13;
assistance of the project (Attachment II).&#13;

ATTACHMENT I&#13;
ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY GOTN&#13;
1.   State Water Policy: A Tamil Nadu State Water Policy has been&#13;
prepared in line with the National Water Policy (GOI, 1987), and&#13;
issued by Government Order Number 716 dated 13.7.1994. The State&#13;
Water  Policy  emphasizes  management  of  water  as  a   unitary&#13;
resource:   by  river  basin,  conjunctively  for   surface   and&#13;
groundwater,   integrating  environmental   management,  planning&#13;
holistically for all uses of water and prioritising water&#13;
allocation  to  maximise  productivity.   Under  the  Policy,  in&#13;
addition to creating the institutional capability to handle water&#13;
planning and allocation described below, the state intends to&#13;
establish legislation for regulating groundwater; improve the&#13;
efficiency and productivity of existing water infrastructure;&#13;
improve hydrological monitoring; establish regulatory measures to&#13;
protect against over extraction of groundwater; prepare flood&#13;
control, drainage and drought management plans; review and&#13;
rationalise water rates including the principle that users should&#13;
pay for services to ensure economic and financial sustainability;&#13;
and undertake a major drive for participation of beneficiaries in&#13;
the water sector.&#13;
2.   Water  Planning:  GOTN has taken all  measures  required  to&#13;
establish the institutional features for multi-sectoral water&#13;
planning on a river basin basis. A Water Resources Control and&#13;
Review Council (WRCRC), chaired by the Chief Minister, has been&#13;
created (G.O.Ms.No. 1404, dt:30.9.93) to make decisions on State&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 5 of 14&#13;
Water planning and allocation. The Institute for Water Studies&#13;
(IWS) -has been made "Nodal Agency" for state water planning and&#13;
Secretariat of the WRCRC (G.O.Ms.No.578 dt:7.4.93), and the&#13;
position of head of IWS upgraded to CE level (G.O.Ms.No. 586&#13;
dt:10.4.93).   The  IWS  work programme  and  staffing  has  been&#13;
adjusted to handle its new responsibilities and to prepare basin&#13;
and state water plans.&#13;
3.   Institutional   Reform:   Following a detailed institutional&#13;
study and the recommendations of GOTN's High Powered Committee, a&#13;
specialist "Water Resources Organisation" (WRO) has been created&#13;
through bifurcation of PWD into the WRO and a separate branch&#13;
handling non-water related activities, and decision taken to&#13;
reorganise    WRO   around   functional    specialisations    and&#13;
decentralisation   along   river   basin   lines   (G.O.Ms.No.279&#13;
dt:29.3.94).   WRO  is to be headed by an  Engineer-in-Chief,  in&#13;
full charge of all of WRO's activities and answerable to the&#13;
Secretary, PWD (Orders will be issued shortly). Reorganisation of&#13;
WRO   is   underway   following  the   recommendations   of   the&#13;
institutional study.&#13;
4.   Expenditure Prioritization:       In line with the state water&#13;
policy and the objectives under the WRCP, GOTN intends a new&#13;
prioritisation for WRO expenditures, emphasising intensified use&#13;
and sustainability of existing infrastructure and upgrading of&#13;
WRO capabilities. Commencing with the completed 1994/95 budget&#13;
exercise and for all future years, GOTN will assure funding to&#13;
WRO in the following priority order: {i) upgrading of WRO's&#13;
institutional capability under the WRCP and full required funding&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
for   O&amp;M  of  existing  facilities;  (ii)   rehabilitation   and&#13;
modernisation of existing facilities; (iii) viable investments to&#13;
complete existing schemes; and (iv) viable new investment. Also,&#13;
(v) criteria and a screening process for selection of future&#13;
investments in the water sector have been developed based on&#13;
economic viability (ERR of 12%), justification within a basin&#13;
plan and the state's overall plan, hydrological, environmental&#13;
and   social   assessment,  and   conformity   with   established&#13;
engineering standards.&#13;
5.   Maintenance  Fundinq:    GOTN is  committed  to  maintaining&#13;
water sector infrastructure. To recoup on the unsatisfactory&#13;
situation of earlier years, O&amp;M funding was increased from&#13;
Rs.120/ha in 1992/93 to Rs.200/ha in 1993/94 and to Rs.265/ha in&#13;
the current 1994/95 fiscal year. The 1994/95 provision includes&#13;
an average of Rs.150/ha in separate budget accounts exclusively&#13;
for maintenance works expenditures, corresponding to the needs on&#13;
works expenditures for 1994/95 worked out by WRO. GOTN will&#13;
ensure  that  maintenance  works  funding  needs  are   similarly&#13;
provided in full and timely fashion in future years, based on an&#13;
annual  command-by-command  programming,  budgeting  and   review&#13;
process.&#13;
6.   farmer Participation and Turnover:   Based on its historical&#13;
experience and pilot efforts over a number of years, GOTN is of&#13;
the view that sustainable and high yielding irrigation must&#13;
,involve beneficiaries in planning and management. Preparation of&#13;
the WRCP has provided the opportunity to develop a state-wide&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 14&#13;
approach- to be progressively implemented in association with the&#13;
scheme rehabilitation and modernisation program - to involve&#13;
farmers in scheme management, and to turnover operations and&#13;
maintenance of improved distributaries to farmer organizations.&#13;
Vigorous staff effort, consultancy,training, farmer organization&#13;
activities and piloting have been implemented over the past year&#13;
in preparation for this drive. As further experience is gained,&#13;
the programme will be adjusted as needed. A model Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding and By-laws for farmer councils will be approved&#13;
by the GOTN (orders will be issued shortly).&#13;
7.   Cost  Recovery:   Water charges to farmers (basic  rate plus&#13;
irrigation cesses) average between Rs.200-210/ha and thus fully&#13;
cover maintenance works needs (Rs.150/ha in 1994/95) and about&#13;
80% of all recurrent expenditures of WRO including establishment.&#13;
while these rates are amongst the highest in India, GOTN has for&#13;
some time been interested in simplifying the structure of rates&#13;
and  providing closer linkage with the costs of water supply.   A&#13;
Water Rates Rationalization Committee, established in 1987, will&#13;
be making recommendations further to a detailed ongoing study.&#13;
On conclusion of the committee's work, GOTN is interested in&#13;
creating a permanent apparatus to annually examine water rates to&#13;
enable adjustments over time as appropriate, for industrial and&#13;
commercial  rates  as well as for agriculture.   Rates  for  bulk&#13;
water supply for industrial and commercial use were increased by&#13;
over   six-fold  in  1991,  and  agricultural  rates  have   been&#13;
periodically adjusted through increases in the irrigation cesses.&#13;
An opportunity is also present, through farmer organizations, to&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 8 of 14&#13;
progressively internalise revenues collection and expenditures at&#13;
the levels of the operating systems and to eventually adjust to&#13;
volumetric supply and charging arrangements linked to service&#13;
costs.   As  discussed  below, such and other  measures  will  be&#13;
considered   and,  as  appropriate,  introduced  in   line   with&#13;
experience  gained  with  the  systems  improvement  and   farmer&#13;
turnover progtalnme and on the basis of an established permanent&#13;
capability to annually examine rates and provide recommendations.&#13;
8.   Land  Acquisition  and  Economic  Rehabilitation:   GOTN  is&#13;
committed to ensuring that project affected persons under the&#13;
WRCP are as well off or better off than their previous situation.&#13;
This will be based on implementation of Land Acquisition and&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (LAERAPs) for each of the&#13;
project   sites,  including  use  of  adjusted   procedures   and&#13;
allowances  to  ensure the welfare of the  PAPs.   The  following&#13;
decisions and actions have been implemented: (i) to strengthen&#13;
institutional   capability,  a  Land  Acquisition  and   Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation   Directorate   has  been  established   for   WRO&#13;
(G.O.Ms.No.138 dt:15.2.94), together with a state-level co-&#13;
ordinating  committee  and  district  committees   (G.O.Ms.No.908&#13;
dt:24.8.94) (ii) Land valuation by negotiated settlement has also&#13;
been decided on (G.O.Ms.No.128 Feb 11, 1994) as this allows more&#13;
speed and flexibility in determining compensation levels based on&#13;
full market value and transaction costs for purchase of fully&#13;
equivalent agricultural land. A Government Order will be issued&#13;
shortly,  covering   the   following:  (iii)  The  definition  of&#13;
project affected persons has been adjusted to now include&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
landless PAPs (encroachers, sharecroppers and tenant farmers);&#13;
(iv) experienced and field oriented NGOs with familiarity of the&#13;
localities concerned will be usd for field implementation of the&#13;
LAERAPs including assistance to PAPs with negotiated settlement,&#13;
land purchase, provision of rehabilitation and asset maintenance&#13;
grants, training and all facilitating aspects for economic&#13;
rehabilitation; (v) economic rehabilitation arrangements for&#13;
marginal farmers have been adjusted to enable provision of&#13;
productively comparable land-for-land or, at the PAP's option,&#13;
for usage of a Rehabilitation Grant for creation of productive&#13;
assets at a rate of Rs.14,000/ha of dryland lost or Rs.28,000/ha&#13;
of irrigated land; (vi) an Asset Maintenance Grant will be&#13;
provided to PAPs at the rate of Rs.500/family/month applied from&#13;
date of takeover of the land by WRO; and (vii) decision has been&#13;
taken to target available rural development programmes to LAER&#13;
sites, and to implement a fisheries development programme for&#13;
PAPs at LAER sites. Finally, (viii) an IAS Officer will be&#13;
appointed to head the LAERO, (Orders will be issued shortly) and&#13;
this position will continue to be headed by an IAS Officer for&#13;
atleast the first three years of the project.&#13;
9.   Environmental Action Plan: Following the recommendation of a&#13;
Sectoral    Environmental   Assessment   (November,   1993),    a&#13;
comprehensive Environmental Action Plan (FAP) has been drawn up&#13;
for  implementation  by   WRO.  The  EAP   will  fully  integrate&#13;
environmental management in planning, investment and management&#13;
of the state's water resources. The EAP includes: strengthening&#13;
of    environmental   monitoring   and   analysis    capabilities&#13;

rAMIL NAOU WATER RESOURCES CONSOI1OA rION PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL MODIFICATIONS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1. Water resources planning, development and management is becoming&#13;
more and more complex requiring constant change in organisational structure&#13;
and the use of advanced technology. Tamil Nadu Water Resources&#13;
Organisation created from the farmer irrigation wing of PWS in Marcn 1994,&#13;
must adapt to these changing conditions in order to be effective in fulfilling its&#13;
objectives for the people of the State. The present organisation nas numerous&#13;
lines of authority and its functional capabilities are diffused throughout the&#13;
organisation. Because of the intertransfers between irrigation and buiidings&#13;
and because of the frequent transfers without regard to functional expertise&#13;
there is a marked lack of specialisation to meet the challenges of a&#13;
technological world. In addition, other administrative functions are not&#13;
specifically assigned, overlap with one another, or do not exist. Certain&#13;
management concepts such as programme budgeting, cost accounting,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and a management information system need to be&#13;
established and/or strengthened. An Institutional Study conducted in 1993 by&#13;
PWD, assisted by Consultants, and subsequent evaluations have resulted in&#13;
an action olan to modify its present institutional structure involving&#13;
organisationai, policy, and precedural cnanges. The new organisational&#13;
structure for the WRO is shown on Attachment I Attacnment 2 contains&#13;
functional descriptions of various organisational units in WRO.&#13;
2. Responsibilities of WRO. The WRO is responsibie for planning, daveioping&#13;
and managing the state's water resources for irrigation, bulk water supply,&#13;
drainage and flood control. The WRO will have an expanded role by advising&#13;
the newly formed Water Resources Control and Review Council, developing&#13;
and maintaining a State Water Plan, involving Farmers in irrigation operation&#13;
and maintenance decisions, tuming over certain responsibilities to farmers,&#13;
strengthening environmental management, managing a new land acquisition&#13;
and economic rehabilitation structure, establishing and maintaining a State&#13;
Water Resources Data Centre, and establishing a regulatory mechanism for&#13;
use of groundwater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Organisational Concepts&#13;
3 The new organisation will allow more effective and efficient planning,&#13;
development, operation and maintenance of water resources in the state with&#13;
increased support in programme budgeting and accounting, management&#13;
information system, monitoring and evaluation, staff specialisation, training and&#13;
computer and communication technology. The W~RO wol organise to more&#13;
clearly delineate lines of authority, functional areas of responsibility, and staff&#13;
support responsibilities  In addition there will be more emphasis on&#13;
communicating  management expoctations  with  regard  to  authority,&#13;
responsibility and accountability .The WRO will now be in a better position to&#13;
execuie dis programmes effectively particularly at the basin leve,.&#13;
4 Management: Proper management will be crucial to the effective execution&#13;
of work. Managers wiil be carefully seiectea anc irainea although in thle iuture&#13;
potential managers will be trained in management "fchniques orior to&#13;
seiection. Because of the importance of management ana the time and funds&#13;
required for adequate training, the top managers, will have at least two years&#13;
remaining before retirement. The manager will be conversant with the various&#13;
WRO functions and will be able to communicate easily with all sectors -&#13;
employees, peers, Government Officials, farmers, other water users, state&#13;
agencies, environmental interests, media and the public. At the time of&#13;
selection the person will have at least two years remaining before retirement.&#13;
The Engineer in Chief, as the administrative and technical head of WRO, will&#13;
be highly experienced in several , of not all, of the WRO functions and aue&#13;
consideration should be given to those individuals who nave worked outside&#13;
the State of Tamil Nadu. The auaiifications or thie Caiei tng;neer wiil inciude&#13;
oxpenence in one or more of the WNRO  8.nctions rplanning, daesgn,&#13;
construction, operation, maintenance) with field ana t,eadauarters office&#13;
postings. All Chief Engineer posts will be of eaual rank. The 1.ngineer in Chief&#13;
will decide ail selections and postings at the Superintendaing Engineer and&#13;
below.&#13;
5. Administration: Elements in Administration wiil support ail acbvtiues in WRO&#13;
which include personnel, training, and procurement of computers and other&#13;
office equipment and supplies. Thiis will remove the burden from the functional&#13;
and line managers and allow them to focus in their own responsibilities. .An&#13;
eariy assignment will be to prepare job doscr.ptions ror ail WRO employees&#13;
starting with the Engineer in Chief&#13;
&#13;

T. rraininq: Fraining will be forecasted and buageted  v mwans o. an  liiu3i&#13;
training programme consolidated from requests ot thoe 'NRO organisational&#13;
units. Once approved, the programme is transmitted to iMTi wnich wiil have&#13;
the responsibility of either providing or providing access to trainmng c!asses.&#13;
Liberal use will be made of colleges and universities and private training&#13;
institutions. IMTI will also arrange for study tours. rop level managemnent&#13;
training courses will be initially conducted by persons axperiencod in training&#13;
water managers.&#13;
7. Programme Budget and Accounting: This office will consoiidate ail budget&#13;
requests from WNRO units and provide the system for tracking expenditures to&#13;
measure programme progress. The system wiil be able to determine when cost&#13;
estimates are likely to be exceeded so that corrective action can be taken. The&#13;
system wiil also be used to support irecommenoed fund-transfer between&#13;
projects. 'rhe office will establish and maintain an MIS system.&#13;
8. Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring of activities in WRO wiii be the&#13;
res'ponsibility of the executing unit and wtill be conducted by comparing&#13;
progress with planned objectives. The Monitoring and Evaluation Office wili&#13;
evaluate the monitoring efforts, the progress of the various WRO programmes,&#13;
the benefits of completed projects, and the performance of organisational units&#13;
within WRO  and provide the Engineer in Chief and other managers with&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
9. Planning: Planning is divided into two organisational areas -nstiti.e for&#13;
Water Studies and the planning units at tha Chief Engineer and 3asin&#13;
Manager levels. The IWS is responsible for preparing basin assessments and&#13;
preparing and maintaining a State Water Plan which will serve as a general&#13;
water resources plan for the State. The 'WS will have support elements&#13;
consisting of economists, sociologists, environmental specialists, and&#13;
hydrologists to perform general basin type analyses.The detailed olanning&#13;
activities will be the responsibility or ooth trie Chief Engineer, Plan Formulation&#13;
and the Basin Manager. The Chief Engineer (PF) will conduct the major and&#13;
more complex studies and prepare reports on various schemes, programmes&#13;
and projects that may be self initiated or by request. The Chief Engineer (PF)&#13;
will also have support elements but those eiements wiil be providing detailed&#13;
evaluations such as applied hydrology. The Basin will also conduct planning&#13;
but on a smaller and more routine scale. The Basin Managers olanning wil be&#13;
accomplished consistent with the procedures and standards set forth by the&#13;
Chief Engineer (PF).&#13;

environmental   effects, and  monitor environmental tromplianco  71e&#13;
Environmental Units will be responsible for the engagement o? consultants for&#13;
environmental work. Environmental Cells assigned to the basins will perform&#13;
more limited environmental analyses but wiil monitor environmenial activities in&#13;
the basins. The Cell will also conduct water quality tests and submit results to&#13;
Basin Manager, Ground and Surface Water Resources Data Centro, and&#13;
others as required.&#13;
13.  Data Coliection:  All types of d;ata will bie collected by various&#13;
organisational units in WRO. Engineering data will be coilected by Basin&#13;
Manager in most cases and either used in the Basin Office or supplieci to .ne&#13;
functional Chief Engineer. Ground and Surface Water data will be collected by&#13;
field units of the Data Centre anid transmitted to -he Data Crntre for variricaizon,&#13;
archiving and publishing. Data collected in the basins should be iMade&#13;
available to the Basin Manager as soon as it is collected, betore verification. it&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Water Planning, Allocation and Management&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The  Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP) will&#13;
introduce a more rational and sustainable system of water resources&#13;
development in the State of Tamil Nadu. At present water resource developments&#13;
are taking place across the State in a piecemeal manner on a scheme by scheme&#13;
basis. Coordination amongst the different agencies involved in the development&#13;
of water resources is also minimal. Recognizing this major drawback, GOTN&#13;
established during the course of preparation of this project (in September&#13;
1993) a coordinating body called the Water Resources Control and Review&#13;
Council (WRCRC). This council is chaired by the Chief Minister with the&#13;
Minister for PWD(WRO) acting as one of three vice-chairmen. All GOTN&#13;
departments concerned with the development and use of water resources in an&#13;
environmentally sustainable manner are represented in this council. An&#13;
environmental committee will be set up under the WRCRC to ensure adequate&#13;
emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement in the development of&#13;
water resources in the State. Institute of Water Studies (IWS) has been&#13;
appointed as the Secretariat for the WRCRC. Tamil Nadu is a water scarce&#13;
State. Water demands of various sectors have to be met in an optimal and&#13;
coordinated manner to make the best use of the limited water available. In&#13;
order to achieve this, developments will have to be analysed in the context of&#13;
a river basin or sub-basin. A State Water Policy (SWP) in line with the&#13;
National Water Policy (GOI, 1987), has also been prepared by GOTN. The SWP&#13;
recommends basin planning as an essential prerequisite for further&#13;
development. IWS has been appointed as the nodal agency for State Water&#13;
Planning. Basin and State water planning activities would be carried out by&#13;
the Institute of Water Studies (IWS) which comes under the Engineer-in-Chief&#13;
of WRO.&#13;
2.    General guidelines developed by the CWC are being adopted in preparing&#13;
River Basin Plans. The basic approach consists of estimating total water&#13;
availability in each basin/sub-basin at the beginning of each planned period&#13;
and matching it with the total demand - irrigation, hydropower, domestic,&#13;
industrial, livestock, fisheries, environmental, recreation, etc. Water&#13;
availability is computed on the basis of the water resources of the basin and&#13;
resources from outside the basin transferred to the basin. The demands are&#13;
based on the socio-economic status of the basin. In assessing the resources of&#13;
ungaged basins, standard techniques would be used. Requirements for additional&#13;
hydrometeorological stations would be identified Similarly, appropriate&#13;
techniques would be employed to estimate the groundwater resource availability&#13;
categorised by differing quality ranges. GIS (Geographic Information Systems)&#13;
Technology would be used in preparing data and presenting results. Simulation&#13;
models such as catchment response models, reservoir operation models and&#13;
optimization techniques using linear and dynamic programming would be adopted&#13;
to evaluate development options and investment scenarios. Recommendations for&#13;
allocation of resources over the plan period will be arrived at based on these&#13;
studies. Following the preparation of a basin development plan, management&#13;
strategies would be developed. Real Time Computer Aided Management Systems&#13;
similar to that prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology for the&#13;
Thambaraparani Basin would be developed for all the basins. Such systems will&#13;
assist the field operators in more timely and wiser decision making in regard&#13;
to bulk water supply operations.&#13;
&#13;

3.     Planning horizons of 5 years, 10 years, 25 years and 50 years will be&#13;
used. The 5 and 10-year plans will be short term plans whilst the 25 and 50-&#13;
year plans will be longer term plans. In each basin, potential for additional&#13;
storage and other water management and conservation techniques would be&#13;
examined including groundwater artificial recharge and water harvesting. Given&#13;
the tight water situation in Tamil Nadu, the Basin Plans should also explore&#13;
the technical and environmental viability of non-conventional resources such&#13;
as reuse of waste water and rainwater harvesting. For inter-State riverbasins,&#13;
flows available to Tamil Nadu at entry point of the river system to the State&#13;
would be considered in determining water availability. The plan prepared for&#13;
such basins would also provide the necessary tools to negotiate further inter-&#13;
State transfer of water.&#13;
4.    Basin plans should include needs for establishing minimum flows required&#13;
during certain periods of the year for environmental purposes and to maintain&#13;
certain water quality standards. They should also consider the very high&#13;
degree of reliability required for drinking water supplies even during drought&#13;
years. A 'Drought Water Plan' should be developed for each basin along with a&#13;
normal plan where 1 in 50 or 1 in 100 year drought conditions are estimated&#13;
and measures outlined for restriction of preselected water deliveries to meet&#13;
critical needs. Drought Water Plans would provide the necessary tools to&#13;
rapidly respond to critical and emergency drought situations.&#13;
5.    The State of Tamil Nadu is drained by seventeen river basins varying in&#13;
size from 1,670 sq.km (Kodayar Basin) to 44,010 sq.km (Cauvery Basin) .&#13;
Thirteen basins are contained within the State while four basins including&#13;
Cauvery Basin are inter-State. The total surface and groundwater resources are&#13;
estimated to be 24,864 million cubic meters (MCM) and 25,291 MCM respectively.&#13;
With a population of 55.6 million (1991 estimates) the per capita water&#13;
availability is about 900 cu.m which is less than a quarter of the national&#13;
average of 4000 cu.m. About 95% of the surface water resources and about 65%&#13;
of the groundwater resources have already been developed, primarily to meet&#13;
agricultural needs.&#13;
6.    Preliminary water resource assessments of twelve basins have been&#13;
carried out by IWS since 1983 either on its own or with technical and&#13;
financial assistance from UNDP. Rapid assessment of water resources of the&#13;
remaining five basins is currently under way. The work carried out so far&#13;
covers basin physiography, geology, meteorology, hydrology and hydrogeology as&#13;
well as appraisals of existing irrigation and other schemes. Assessment of&#13;
water resources is based on measured data in about ten basins - short period&#13;
historic gauged data in five basins and data measured at dams and diversion&#13;
weirs in five other basins. The remaining seven basins do not have any&#13;
measured data of any kind. This deficit is to be rectified through the&#13;
proposed National Hydrology Project (NHP) to be financed by the Bank. The flow&#13;
measuring network would be improved under the NHP through the installation of&#13;
100 additional gauging stations (at present there are only 33 gauges in the&#13;
State). Irrigation water demands are based on crop water requirements computed&#13;
using the modified Penman method with assumed overall irrigation efficiency of&#13;
60%. Domestic and industrial water demands are based on certain assumed growth&#13;
rates in these sectors.&#13;
7.    In addition to the above, IWS has carried out Water Resources Management&#13;
Studies for three basins in conjunction with UNDP. Three more basins are&#13;
currently being studied. These studies focus on various management strategies&#13;
in a basin and include recommendations on the improvement of existing schemes&#13;
and on the implementation of new schemes. Basin water balance is computed from&#13;
a computer simulation model consisting of a tank irrigation module,&#13;
river/reservoir module and a regional groundwater module.&#13;

B.    Activities described above for basin planning can be carried out by IWS&#13;
with suitable technical and other assistance from the project. Water planning,&#13;
allocation and management capabilities of GOTN will be upgraded through&#13;
improvements to the physical, financial and human resources of IWS.&#13;
Institute for Water Studies&#13;
9.    Planning, allocation and management of GOTN's water and related land&#13;
resources capabilities will be improved by activities at basin and State-wide&#13;
(or macro) levels in a manner which will assist political and administrative&#13;
decisions about overall resources occurrence and use including future&#13;
regulatory aspects. While planning capabilities will also be improved at&#13;
project specific (development and operations) levels, this Annex focuses on&#13;
macro-resources planning requirements. Basin planning responsibilities,&#13;
including compliance with the following schedule, have been given to the&#13;
Institute for Water Studies (IWS) headed by a Director (Rank of Chief&#13;
Engineer):&#13;
(a)   31 March 1995        Completion of rapid assessments of 5 remaining&#13;
basins not yet subjected to a water assessment.&#13;
(b)   December 1995        Preparation  of a State wide "Framework Water&#13;
Resources Plan" based on basin assessments&#13;
(12 detailed together with 5 rapid assessments).&#13;
(c)   March 1998           Complete preparation of detailed "River Basin&#13;
Plans", basin by basin and preparation of a detailed&#13;
"State Water Plan".&#13;
(d)   1999 and beyond      Maintain updated State Water Plan by basins&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
Work plan details by specific river-basins are given in Table 1 of&#13;
the Project Files.&#13;
10.         The IWS will act as the Secretariat for the recently established&#13;
Water Resources Control and Review Council (WRCRC) and, therefore, have direct&#13;
access to the State's principle water policy implementation body. The WRCRC&#13;
is chaired by the Chief Minister. In addition, the charter of IWS, as the&#13;
nodal agency for State-wide (basin by basin) planning, will be supported by&#13;
institutional arrangements that require assistance (in carrying out basin and&#13;
State Planning) from the CE Plan Formulation and CE Basin Managers in each of&#13;
the four regional (composite) basins that cover the entire State.&#13;
Environmental planning will be an integral part of Basin activities, hence,&#13;
the State water planning process. Therefore, the WRO has established&#13;
environmental cells, respectively, within IWS, under each of the four Basin&#13;
Managers and under the CE Plan Formulation. In addition, the IWS is assured of&#13;
inter-departmental cooperation in its role as the State's nodal water planning&#13;
agency, by the establishment of inter-departmental liasion/coordination&#13;
officers for such purpose within each of the other directorates, boards and/or&#13;
departmental agencies that are members of the WRCRC. (Project File Table 2).&#13;
11.         Achievement of the macro-planning goals of the State will also be&#13;
supported by the establishment of a State Water Resources data Center (WRDC)&#13;
within WRO headed by a Chief Engineer. The WRDC will be responsible for&#13;
operation of a modern system for collection, assimilation, verification and&#13;
dissemination of surface water and groundwater data and associated water&#13;
quality for both resource bases. These data will be made available&#13;
expeditiously to all users within the State, including basin managers and&#13;
project - specific planners as well as inter - departmental agencies&#13;
responsible for multi-purpose water planning and utilisation (urban,&#13;

industrial, village, energy, environmental, agricultural, etc) through modern&#13;
communication and computer based systems. The WRDC will be staffed from within&#13;
existing staff and administrative resources of GOTN. Establishment of the&#13;
WRDC and all related improvements will be funded under the proposed National&#13;
Hydrology Project.&#13;
12.         In order to carry out its WRO and State-wide responsibilities, the&#13;
IWS will be strengthened by additional at staff positions, as identified in&#13;
Table 3 of the Project File. There are currently 57 professional and technical&#13;
staff. AdditiQnal staff positions will provide a total of 96 professional and&#13;
technical staff at IWS. Specific expertise will cover the following principal&#13;
disciplines: engineering, geology, geophysics, hydrochemistry, environment,&#13;
economics, sociology, legal, computer and other scientific-technical and&#13;
administrative disciplines. The Director, IWS, has been sanctioned at Chief&#13;
Engineer level. He has also been given authority to submit budget requirements&#13;
directly to government without routing through another CE office (G.O.(D) No.7&#13;
PW (RZ) dated January 10, 1994) as had been the case in the past, which&#13;
should enhance and expedite management of IWS.&#13;
13          Fulfilment of the IWS/WRCP planning mission requires that&#13;
Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) capabilities are&#13;
established for carrying out time-bound basin planning objectives. Thus,&#13;
fully functional units in these technical specialities will be established&#13;
within the IWS. Establishment of a GIS unit will provide capability to&#13;
generate analyses, monitoring systems and maps based on digitally interpreted&#13;
data covering many basic planning parameters. Placement of the current Remote&#13;
Sensing Unit (formerly under the PWD's Groundwater wing) and staffing and&#13;
equipping it with a full range of interpretive capabilities (photo and&#13;
digital), under IWS will establish the necessary basin planning capabilities;&#13;
however, substantial Training and Technical Assistance will be needed to make&#13;
the staff and new equipment fully operational in terms of its assigned&#13;
planning responsbilities. The investment in Training and Technical Assistance&#13;
is sizeable as serious effort is needed to meet the State's urgent planning&#13;
requirements and the long term benefits would be substantial.&#13;
TraininQ and Technical Assistance&#13;
14.         Summary estimates of IWS staff requirements (comprising short and&#13;
long term course) for "Training and Study Tours in Foreign countries" are&#13;
given in Table 4 of the Project File and of Staff needs for "In-service&#13;
Training in India for the Technical Personnel of IWS" is given in Table 5.&#13;
15.         Training proposed in foreign countries comprises 3-month (short&#13;
term) courses and study tours resulting in a total of about 105 months of&#13;
professional staff training in Basins and State water planning, hydrological&#13;
networks, river simulations, reservoir operations, flood regulation, GIS&#13;
applications, remote sensing, groundwater modeling, conjunctive use,&#13;
artificial recharge, environmental assessments and applied economics. Six&#13;
month (long-term) courses would include training in surface water, remote&#13;
sensing, ground water assessments for which a total of about 120 months of&#13;
training is estimated (see Table 4 of the Project File).&#13;
16.         In-service training program in India for technical personel of IWS&#13;
is summarised in Table 5 of the Project File. Training includes: computer&#13;
applications in hydrology; geophysical, geochemical and photogeology;&#13;
environmental science (post graduate level); and, river basin planning at the&#13;
Central Training Unit, Pune. Other institutions that would carry out in-&#13;
service training would be: IIT Madras, Anna University; NIH-Roorkee&#13;
University; NRSA -Dehradun; NEERI, Nagpur and CWPRS, Pune. A total of 244 man-&#13;
months of training of which 90 man-months would be at post graduate level-&#13;
would be taken up over the 7 - year project cycle.&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND FARMER TURNOVER&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The increasingly high opportunity cost of irrigation water poses a&#13;
challenge to the Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN). Water must be used more&#13;
productively in agriculture and the starting point for the government and the&#13;
farmers is reliable, equitable, and sustainable services. Through the System&#13;
Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SIFO) component of the Water Resources&#13;
Consolidation Project (WRCP), the Water Resources Organization (WRO) of the&#13;
GOTN will provide for structural improvements of the irrigation system to&#13;
enhance reliability and equity. To ensure sustainability, the WRO will also&#13;
promote active participation of farmers in system improvements and in its&#13;
Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M). This Annex will describe the SIFO component&#13;
and will present the technical, financial, and institutional features&#13;
necessary for operational effectiveness of the project.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Tamil Nadu has a long tradition of irrigation development. The earliest&#13;
large-ocale diversion schemes built along 'modern" lines date back to the&#13;
second century A.D., while small-scale irrigation from tanks and wells has&#13;
existed far longer. The current era of government-constructed irrigation&#13;
infrastructure dates from the latter half of the 19th century when the British&#13;
Colonial government established the Public Works Department (PWD). The PWD&#13;
undertook construction of now irrigation systems, as well as repairs to&#13;
village tanks. New projects generally entailed the amalgamation of existing&#13;
locally-managed tanks or diversions into a single larger system managed by the&#13;
PWD. The management trend has been one of steady centralization under the&#13;
PWD, and a concomitant lessening of farmers' management responsibility.&#13;
3.    As the government has assumed increasing responsibilities for allocation&#13;
of water and for the development and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of&#13;
irrigation systems, there have been growing pressures to provide ever&#13;
increasing financial resources for both plan and non-plan budgets. Unable to&#13;
meet these demands for resources, O&amp;M budgets have been stretched to the&#13;
extent that systemic deterioration of the physical infrastructure has taken&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 22&#13;
4.    Initial corrective measures were introduced in the 1980. through a&#13;
systematic program of rehabilitation investments to restore some of the&#13;
largest systems to their original performance levels. World Bank financing&#13;
for this effort included the Periyar Vaigai Rehabilitation Project and the&#13;
National Water Management Project (NWMP), an umbrella project covering seven&#13;
schemes, with start-up activities in several others throughout the state.&#13;
Both these projects have focussed on rectifying the physical deterioration&#13;
caused by deferred maintenance, with attendant improvements in system design.&#13;
5.    Under the WRCP, the need for rehabilitation will be addressed as an&#13;
opportunity not only to meet the original design standards, but also to&#13;
modernize and reorient the system to meet the new demands of agricultural&#13;
production. The project seeks to improve system performance through three&#13;
important elements:&#13;
a)    Infrastructure improvements in the system from the head of the&#13;
main canal to the sluices including structural repairs, changes in&#13;
regulatory structures, and works for the restoration of design&#13;
canal capacity in line with: (i) an operational plan prepared in&#13;
association with farmers; and (ii) a system of water control&#13;
designed to deliver water in proportion to command area below the&#13;
structured level;&#13;
b)    Enhancement of staff skills of specialized O&amp;M units within a&#13;
reorganized WRO in the formulation and implementation of&#13;
operational plans and in the formulation of a maintenance program&#13;
aided by the introduction of a number of modern technologies and&#13;
management systems. These will include computer aided design,&#13;
wireless and electronic communication, remote sensing, and basin&#13;
management; and&#13;
c)    A new type of public-private partnership through intensive farmer&#13;
participation in planning the above infrastructural improvements&#13;
and through decentralized management of the irrigation system with&#13;
farmers' organizations taking full operational and financial&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of the system, typically below the&#13;
distributary or minor, covering about 500 ha.&#13;
6.    The WRCP integrates these three elements as mutually reinforcing&#13;
components, learning from previous Bank experience that it is important not to&#13;
pursue the design and implementation of these elements independent of each&#13;
other. For instance, rehabilitation investments without adequate attention to&#13;
system management or farmer participation have, in the past, resulted in the&#13;
construction of civil works without financial and institutional&#13;
sustainability. Under the WRCP, the rehabilitation and modernization of the&#13;
system will be contingent on farmer interest and agreement to turn over O&amp;M&#13;
responsibilities below the structured level to farmer organizations.&#13;
Similarly, cost recovery efforts through farmer participation in past Bank&#13;
projects have yielded few results where inadequate attention was paid to&#13;
system improvements to ensure reliable water flow, especially at the tail&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 22&#13;
outlets. In WRCP, the implementation of a program of reliable and equitable&#13;
water service will be accompanied by financial and management participation by&#13;
farmer..&#13;
7.    WRCP-financed physical improvements, coupled with a new management&#13;
partnership between farmers and the WRO, will set the stage for a new era of&#13;
irrigated agriculture in the State. Eventually, the WRO will be able to&#13;
negotiate contracts with farmer organizations for a set proportion of&#13;
available water. There are opportunities to explore volumetric delivery and&#13;
pricing of water. Further improvements in design can follow from farmers'&#13;
interests and the demands of diversified agriculture in the State.&#13;
System deficiencies&#13;
S.    The WRO provides irrigation services to a Culturable Command Area (CCA)&#13;
of over 2.2 million ha in Tamil Nadu through major and medium schemes (about&#13;
1.5 million ha) and minor schemes (0.7 million ha). Many of these schemes are&#13;
old and have been proposed for rehabilitation and modernization under the&#13;
WRCP.&#13;
9.    A detailed assessment carried out by the WRO with the assistance of&#13;
national and international consultants in preparation for the WRCP pointed to&#13;
several deficiencies resulting from deasign errors, operational gaps, and the&#13;
long neglect of O&amp;M, contributing significantly to the unreliable and&#13;
inequitable distribution of water and poor irrigation services. Among the&#13;
deficiencies are:&#13;
a)    Design problems.  Inadequate capacity of main canals,&#13;
distributaries, and minors due to design and construction errors&#13;
(Vaigai; Parambikulam Aliyar; Kodayar); wrong alignment of&#13;
channels, passing either too close to the river (Vaigai) or hill&#13;
(Parambikulam Aliyar); improper entry conditions causing eddies&#13;
at offtakes of main canals and distributaries (Lower Bhavani);&#13;
excessive number of control structures requiring manual&#13;
adjustments at unrealistically short intervals (Sathanur);&#13;
inadequate surplussing arrangements (system tanks).&#13;
b)    Structural and maintenance problems.  Damaged or deteriorated&#13;
masonry structures including outlets, and cross drainage&#13;
structures (almost all schemes); corroded check gates and rusted&#13;
hoists; slips and slides of canal slopes (Parambikulam Aliyar,&#13;
Lower Bhavani); damaged undertunnels (Lower Bhavani, Kodayar);&#13;
constrictions in waterways (Kodayar);&#13;
c)    FLow Constraints.  Heavy siltation (Palar, Poiney, Cheyyar,&#13;
Vaigai); heavy seepage in main canal and distributaries&#13;
(Parambikulam Aliyar, Lower Bhavani, Kodayar); weed growth&#13;
(Vaigai); damaged lining (Kodayar, Parambikulam Aliyar).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 22&#13;
10.   The cumulative effect of these system deficiencies is unsatisfactory&#13;
water management and water control. This is reflected in low operational and&#13;
conveyance efficiency and unreliable supplies in all segments of the canal&#13;
system. In many-existing schemes, 20 to 30 per cent of the command, mostly in&#13;
the tail reaches do not receive water with another 20 to 30 per cent receiving&#13;
only partial supplies. The overall water supply plan at the project level is&#13;
based on "water duty" estimated from experience. Often, crop needs,&#13;
especially in their critical stages, actual area to be irrigated, varying&#13;
precipitation in the subcommands at different times during the season, and&#13;
actual conveyance and operational losses in different parts of the system are&#13;
not considered. WRO's assessment also indicated insufficient field monitoring&#13;
of operational plans, of water levels and water flows.&#13;
11.   Fazuer Participation. The assessment noted that consultation with&#13;
farmers in formulating or monitoring operational plans was inadequate, as was&#13;
farmer participation in planning and designing improvements above the sluice&#13;
gate. Presently, farmer participation is limited to a few government selected&#13;
representatives of farmers at scheme level for finalization of water&#13;
deliveries from the main canals or in deciding the opening/closing of water&#13;
supply. Similarly, farmers are not involved in discussions and decisions&#13;
regarding O&amp;M of the main system, branch canals and distributaries except&#13;
when there are serious breakdowns in water supply.&#13;
12.   There is a linkage between design problems, lack of farmer participation&#13;
and maintenance problems. Inadequate capacities, or improperly designed&#13;
structures can result in unplanned water delivery and structural failures,&#13;
canal slips, erosion and increased siltation. Similarly, failure to bring in&#13;
the end user -- the farmer -- to the design process and in the management of&#13;
O&amp;M instills the attitude that the government is solely responsible for&#13;
operation and maintenance. And the absence of consultation with farmers in&#13;
formulating operational plans each season sets the stage for water thefts,&#13;
damage, and further disruption of the schedule when water supplies are short.&#13;
13.   The physical deficiencies pervasive in Tamil Nadu's irrigation schemes&#13;
are symptomatic of deeper-rooted problems of staff skills, and centralized,&#13;
top-down management. Addressing the physical ills besetting the system&#13;
through rehabilitation and modernization must, therefore, as in the WRCP, be&#13;
accompanied by management changes and training changing the relationship&#13;
between the WRO and farmers into a management partnership. The WRCP would&#13;
facilitate the process of reorientation within the WRO through system&#13;
improvements, farmer organization and turnover, and agency restructuring.&#13;
Infrastructure improvements&#13;
14.   The system-level objectives of the WRCP are to restore or enhance design&#13;
and construction standards, improve operational efficiency, and maintain the&#13;
system in an excellent operating condition to meet the growing demands of&#13;
reliable and equitable water supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex4&#13;
Page 5 of 22&#13;
15.   Two stages of irrigation system improvement are addressed by the&#13;
project. Stage I refers to irrigation systems where there has been no recent&#13;
structural improvement of the main system. Physical work will focus on&#13;
rehabilitating the main system to ensure proper water flow to all secondaries,&#13;
and some improvements to the secondaries as well. Stage II refers to&#13;
irrigation systems that have already received basic improvements in the main&#13;
system as, for example, in the NWMP. Under the WRCP, these Stage II schemes&#13;
will undergo modernization to improve operations throughout the system,&#13;
including some work at the field channel level. Integrated with the physical&#13;
improvements of both Stage I and Stage II will be organizational activities to&#13;
establish a 3-tier structure of farmer associations. Through these&#13;
organizations, farmers will assume full management responsibility for O&amp;M at&#13;
the distributary level and assist the WRO on main system operational planning.&#13;
A.    Stage I : Ensuring Reliable and Equitable Water Service and Farmer&#13;
Participation. The main objective of Stage I investments is to&#13;
ensure reliable and equitable delivery of water in all sections of&#13;
the irrigation system and at the heads of each distributary, minor&#13;
and sluice offtakes. Additionally, flow management within the&#13;
distributaries will be simplified through the use of proportional&#13;
dividers. Farmers will be consulted and actively associated on&#13;
all phases of the improvements, including the setting of&#13;
priorities for work below the distributary head. Farmer&#13;
organization will run concurrently with the physical improvements.&#13;
Completion of Stage I will be defined as completion of the&#13;
physical works, and assumption of vigilance responsibilities at&#13;
the distributary level by duly registered Farmer Councils (FCs).&#13;
1)    Key elements of Stage I improvements will include the&#13;
following:&#13;
a)    Physical improvements.  Based on cost estimates of&#13;
several schemes in Tamil Nadu, limited investments&#13;
averaging about Rs. 5,300 per ha (ranging from Rs.&#13;
4,000 to Rs. 6,800  per ha in different schemes) for&#13;
priority works will be carried out in the main and&#13;
secondary levels of the system.'   Below the sluice,&#13;
on-farm works averaging about Rs. 750 per ha are&#13;
planned.   A new design feature that will be&#13;
introduced under the project is the "structured&#13;
system' concept. New water control structures will be&#13;
inserted or the existing ones upgraded, to deliver&#13;
proportional flow to all segments of the canal below&#13;
Rs. 4000 per ha was estimated on empirical grounds on the basis of&#13;
field studies for 9 of the 10 schemes selected for Stage I improvements. For the&#13;
remaining scheme, Vaigai, where the main canal was heavily damaged during recent&#13;
floods, the investment needed is about Rs. 6,800 per ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 6 of 22&#13;
the structured level -- usually head of a&#13;
distributary, sometimes a minor -- without manual&#13;
regulation below that level. The objective is to&#13;
ensure delivery of water at all offtakes below the&#13;
structured level in proportion to their command.&#13;
b)    Farmer organization and turnover.  The process of&#13;
dialogue with WRO regarding Stage I improvements&#13;
within the distributary will be accompanied by&#13;
organizing efforts to establish FCs at the&#13;
distributary level or around a suitable hydraulic unit&#13;
(generally about 500 ha of command area). Councils&#13;
will be registered societies and will assume full&#13;
management responsibility for O&amp;M within the&#13;
distributary, and will assist the WRO in main system&#13;
operational planning. By agreeing to assume&#13;
distributary-level management, the farmers can (1)&#13;
request further improvements under Stage II and (2)&#13;
ask for information about the entire canal system&#13;
operation. Details of the farmer organization and&#13;
turnover (FOT) activities are given in the following&#13;
section.&#13;
c)    Operations and maintenance.  New emphasis will be&#13;
placed on O&amp;H both within the reformed structure of&#13;
the WRO at the basin and scheme levels. Budget&#13;
allocations for maintenance works will be set to&#13;
ensure the sustainability of project-financed&#13;
improvements. A new monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
will be put in place based on flow and water level&#13;
measurements, crop data, remote sensing techniques,&#13;
and training in monitoring and evaluation. Maintenance&#13;
equipment will be upgraded and new procedures&#13;
implemented to ensure effective utilization of the&#13;
equipment. On the operations side, a consultative&#13;
process will be introduced by which project staff work&#13;
with farmers through an Apex Committee at the scheme&#13;
level, as well as through individual FCs, to set&#13;
operational plans for each season.&#13;
2.    Sequence of Physical Improvements&#13;
a)    The sequence of physical improvements will be confined&#13;
to the main system (i.e., the main and branch canal.),&#13;
for about two years. Within the distributary, the&#13;
overall objective will be to provide a structured&#13;
network capable of delivering water to all offtake&#13;
proportionate to command area once the&#13;
distributary/minor is opened (Box 1). Upon completion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 7 of 22&#13;
of the physical works, the main responsibility of the&#13;
WRO will be to ensure the allocated rate of flow of&#13;
water at the head of the structured network,&#13;
distributary or minor as the case may be.&#13;
Responsibility for managing water distribution below&#13;
the structured level would be transferred to FCs, as&#13;
discussed later in this section.&#13;
b)    The major schemes covering about 400,000 ha to be&#13;
taken up for Stage I works are shown in Table 1&#13;
attached. An additional 40 minor schemes covering&#13;
about 100,000 ha are shown in attached Table 2.&#13;
Schemes improvement plans will be based on detailed&#13;
designs and cost estimates derived from field visits.&#13;
Attachment A shows the proposed schedule of&#13;
investment, presented by scheme and by year.&#13;

B. Stage II: Improving Conveyance Efficiency&#13;
1)    Stage II physical works are aimed at improving conveyance&#13;
efficiency and water control throughout the system, from the&#13;
main canal down to the field channels. The first set of&#13;
schemes (Table 1) selected for Stage II in the first year&#13;
have begun the process of system improvements and&#13;
rehabilitation/ modernization investments under the ongoing&#13;
NWMP. Under the WRCP, these systems will receive selective&#13;
lining in critical reaches of the main canal, regulators and&#13;
some masonry structures. Flow measuring devices (automatic&#13;
stage recorders) will be provided at the head of major&#13;
distributaries to facilitate an eventual adoption of&#13;
volumetric supply of water. Other structures -- aqueducts,&#13;
diversion structures, pickup weirs, anicuts -- will be&#13;
repaired as per needs determined scheme by scheme. The&#13;
average cost of these improvements would be about Rs. 6000&#13;
per ha.&#13;
2)    The success of the proportionate dividers referred to&#13;
earlier depends on effective maintenance. Issues related to&#13;
maintenance to be addressed during Stage II include:&#13;
effective methods of deweeding; lining to prevent&#13;
proliferation of weeds; measures to reduce recurring&#13;
expenditures on sedimentation; and protection of completed&#13;
works from accidental or deliberate destruction. These&#13;
issues will be resolved in discussions between farmers and&#13;
the WRO. Where cost effective solutions are not evident,&#13;
research and development will be supported.2 In addition&#13;
to the civil works in Stage II, flow measuring devices with&#13;
automatic stage recorders will be provided to encourage&#13;
measurement of water supply and, in the long run, to&#13;
facilitate volumetric supply. In cases where lining results&#13;
in change in the design geometry of the canal prism and as a&#13;
result, water levels, suitable modifications or remodelling&#13;
of the corresponding masonry structures (regulators,&#13;
bridges, offtake and flumes) will be pursued in the project.&#13;
Distributary-level lining will be carried out only where FCs&#13;
are willing to contribute 20 per cent of the total cost&#13;
prior to the start of works.&#13;
2 The WRCP will support research and study programs of the Institute of&#13;
Hydraulics and Hydrology, Poondi; the Institute of Water Studies, Taramani; and&#13;
the Irrigation Management Training Institute, Trichy; and the Tamil Nadu Water&#13;
Resources Research Fund described elsewhere in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3)    Five of the seven Stage II schemes will be taken up for&#13;
coverage under the FOT program in the first year of the&#13;
project (see Attachment B). Some of these schemes have&#13;
already begun to see indications of a more reliable and&#13;
equitable water services, yet distributary level works&#13;
remain to be done and hence are good candidates for the POT&#13;
program. The two remaining schemes, Tambiraparani and&#13;
Kodayar, will be taken up for FOT in the second year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
16.   System Tan*s.  Tanks are typically monozone earthen bunds built from&#13;
local soil with one or more surplussing arrangements. The water spread is&#13;
relatively large, with large fetch causing considerable wave heights. The&#13;
maximum height of tank bund is even up to 7 m. Most of the tanks are located&#13;
near villages. In case of breach, some tanks located near habitats can create&#13;
a potential danger to the population, as for example in the Ramnad Big Tank in&#13;
Vaigai System, Kadamba in Tamraparani System. During the cyclonic rainfall of&#13;
late 1993, many of the big tanks in Periyar Vaigai and elsewhere were&#13;
breached. Reasons were encroachment on the design flood lift to raise the&#13;
F.T.L.; inadequacy of the surplussing arrangements causing overtopping; lack&#13;
of maintenance, resulting in vertical depression in the tank bunds at&#13;
locations where cart tracks were made by villagers; and breach of a tank in&#13;
the upper reaches causing a chain reaction of breach in all the tanks located&#13;
downstream.&#13;
17.   The project will support renovation of some 80 system tanks once&#13;
detailed studies on some aspects of breaches and a review of design parameters&#13;
are completed. The review will include: assessment of the present approach of&#13;
calculating peak floods by empirical methods and its replacement by a more&#13;
rational alternative; stability analysis of upstream slopes (sudden drawdown&#13;
condition) and downstream slopes (heavy downpour condition, steady seepage&#13;
condition); provision of rock toe at downstream slopes; provision of&#13;
upstream rivetment; determination of the correct storage capacity of tanks by&#13;
accurate surveys; and provision of inclined filters at the downstream hearting&#13;
zone.&#13;
18.   Link Canal and related vorks in Periyar Vaigai.  In addition, the&#13;
project will also support rehabilitation/ modernization works in the Periyar&#13;
Vaigai system financed under two previous Bank credits, including completion&#13;
of the link canal in the Periyar system; construction of by-pass channels to&#13;
existing tanks; and capacity adjustments in offtake and masonry structures;&#13;
and repairs to four breached tanks.&#13;
On-farm development (OFDI works&#13;
19.   OFD provides the last link between the irrigation system and farmers'&#13;
fields through the construction of structures below the sluice, as for&#13;
example, watercourses and field channels. The project will support the&#13;
State's program of OFD works with changes from present practice. Under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 11 of 22&#13;
WRCP, farmer organizations will decide on the need for OFD and assistance for&#13;
OFD will be extended only in outlets where FCs are organized. The WRO would&#13;
undertake topographical surveys, delineating the water course/field channel&#13;
alignments and construction of masonry/concrete structures or profile walls at&#13;
critical locations, spaced at about 75 to 100 meters. The rest of the field&#13;
channel system would be constructed by farmer organizations with their own&#13;
funds. Technical assistance, where necessary, will be extended by the WRO.&#13;
The cost to WRO would be about Rs. 700 per ha, as against the more than Rs.&#13;
3500 per ha as per present practice, where the government bears the full&#13;
burden of the OFD works.   With the start of the WRCP, the OFD model described&#13;
above will be Statewide and replace other existing approaches. The WRO's&#13;
share of the OFD works will be carried out by its own staff or contracted out&#13;
to other agencies such as the Agricultural Engineering Department (AED) or the&#13;
FCs.&#13;
Standardization&#13;
20.   Structures will be classified on the basis of their functional&#13;
requirements and identified by a specific code number: (i) flow measurement&#13;
structures (flumes); (ii) flow control and regulation structures (head&#13;
sluices, baffle distributors, undertunnels); (iii) cross drainage and related&#13;
structures (eg., aqueducts, syphons, drops); (iv) safety structures (eg.,&#13;
escapes, surplussing weirs in tanks); (v) service structures (eg., road&#13;
bridges, bathing areas); (vi) water level control structures (long-crested&#13;
weirs, cross regulators, composite regulators, and (vii) flow proportional&#13;
dividers.&#13;
21.   The glossary of terms used in investigations, planning, design and&#13;
construction of project works would follow the latest version of standards&#13;
published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for river valley projects.&#13;
Publications of standards or practices of the Central Water Commission,&#13;
Central Bureau of Irrigation and Power (CBIP) and of international&#13;
organizations applicable to project works would also be consulted. Standards&#13;
of the Indian Road Congress of the GOI would be consulted for the construction&#13;
of project bridges. Specification of materials and works will be reviewed and&#13;
revised where necessary and the new versions will be furnished to the Bank for&#13;
comments before undertaking works. The procedures to be adopted for carrying&#13;
out repairs of rehabilitation works would be site specific. Nevertheless, the&#13;
relevant guidelines contained in well-known publications (e.g., CWC, ICID,USBR&#13;
manuals) would be used.&#13;
Farmer oraanization and turnover&#13;
22.   Three Important features of the WRCP approach to farmer organization&#13;
are:&#13;
a)    Implementation of organizing efforts will be closely integrated&#13;
with physical improvements to be funded through the project.&#13;
Existing O&amp;M staff (Assistant Engineers, Work Inspectors, and&#13;
Laskars) of the WRD will steer the organizing efforts to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 12 of 22&#13;
coordination during the implementation phase, and after turnover&#13;
is effected.&#13;
b)    Organizing activities will cover three levels -- on the tertiary&#13;
level (sluice commands); the secondary level (distributaries); and&#13;
the scheme level. Turnover of O&amp;M responsibilities at the&#13;
distributary level and below will result in cost savings to WRO&#13;
over the long term, as well as in improved O&amp;M.&#13;
c)    The terms and conditions of turnover will be spelled out in a&#13;
written contract -- Nemorandum of Understanding (MOU) -- between&#13;
the WRO and the newly created distributary-level FCs.&#13;
The turnover program will be applied initially to five schemes, totalling&#13;
70,833 ha, which have already completed Stage I physical improvements under&#13;
the NWHP.3 In two of the schemes, Amaravathy and Sathanur, pilot organizing&#13;
efforts have already been initiated. As soon as the FOT work is well underway&#13;
in this first round of schemes, successive rounds of organizing activity will&#13;
be initiated in the last two of the seven NWMP locations, in all major schemes&#13;
awaiting Stage I improvements, and in those minor schemes and project&#13;
completions where there will be infrastructural improvements at the&#13;
distributary level or below. The sequence of schemes to be taken up for the&#13;
FOT program year by year is shown in Attachment B. The underlying logic in&#13;
planning the sequence of coverage is that it is evolutionary, gets&#13;
progressively intensive, is linked to the sequence of physical works, and&#13;
allows for a "learning approach" for the WRO.&#13;
23.   Structure and function of farmer organizations.  A three-tier farmers'&#13;
organization will be implemented consisting of local sluice level&#13;
organizations, distributary level FCs, and scheme level Apex Committees. The&#13;
first tier of sluice level organizations (20 to 40 ha) will be formal or&#13;
informal. In many cases, indigenous sluice level organizations already exist&#13;
in the field. By tradition, these organizations have assumed responsibility&#13;
for water management below the outlet hiring local staff for O&amp;M purposes.&#13;
Payment is usually in cash or in kind. Since indigenous sluice level&#13;
organizations may already exist and function well, there would be no need to&#13;
impose formal structures. Where necessary, though, they can be formalized&#13;
through registration.&#13;
24.   The focus of WRO's organizing activities would be at the distributary&#13;
level (about 500 ha) where FCs will be established. Each sluice level&#13;
organization will elect three representatives (including one woman&#13;
representative) to form the distributary level FC, a formally registered&#13;
organization under the Societies' Registration Act. A federation of all FCs&#13;
within a scheme command will form an Apex Committee that will have an advisory&#13;
role in main system operations.&#13;
3 The  five  schemes  are:    Amararathy,  Sathanur,  Cumbum,  Marudanadi,&#13;
Sethiathope.&#13;

Page 13 of 22&#13;
25.   The function of the FCg will be:  (1) to provide an organized forum for&#13;
WRO-farmer interaction; (2) to maintain and protect the distributary canals&#13;
and structures that have already been improved under NWMP, or that will be&#13;
improved under WRCP; (3) to ensure equitable water distribution among the&#13;
sluice outlets;' and (4) to assist the WRO in planning system operations.&#13;
Following the formal turnover of O&amp;M responsibility to the Councils, all costs&#13;
of OEM will be borne by farmers (e.g., for canal desilting or deweeding).&#13;
Sluice level organizations, whether informal or formal, will manage water&#13;
services below the field outlet. The function of the Apex Committee will be to&#13;
participate in scheme level consultations on inter-distributary matters and on&#13;
issues related to scheme level water management and FC.&#13;
Financina arrangements&#13;
26.   irrigated farmers in Tamil Nadu are already paying land taxes to the&#13;
Revenue Department which are nominally about the same as the O&amp;M expenditures&#13;
of the WRO, including both works and establishment costs. When actual&#13;
repayment rates (around 80%) are calculated, farmers' real payments are&#13;
roughly equivalent to the agency's recurrent costs. Under the WRCP, farmers&#13;
will be asked to share a larger proportion of the total management burden than&#13;
is currently the case. Most of the increased burden will be "in kind", that&#13;
is, through participation in the activities of management (attending meetings,&#13;
keeping records, monitoring water levels, adjusting flows, resolving disputes,&#13;
etc.). However, there will also be increased financial costs to farmers. To&#13;
ensure a minimal level of 0&amp;M funding below the distributary level, each&#13;
farmer will be required to contribute Rs. 250 per hectare (Rs. 100/acre) for&#13;
deposit in a fixed-deposit, interest bearing account under FC control. The&#13;
annual yield of roughly Rs.30/ha from this account will be supplemented by&#13;
additional collections from the members if O&amp;M costs exceed the interest&#13;
income. These financial provisions will be a condition for signing a&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the WRO and the FC turning over&#13;
distributary O&amp;M to the FCs.&#13;
27.   The Government is examining the possibility of an additional tax to be&#13;
on all farmers directly benefiting from project improvements, with a rebate&#13;
offered to farmers who collectively agree to assume management responsibility&#13;
for their respective distributary canals. The tax will likely take the form&#13;
of a "betterment levy" for which there is ample local precedent, the logic&#13;
being that farmers who receive unusual benefits from new infrastructure should&#13;
contribute to the cost. In the context of turnover of O&amp;M to FCs, the&#13;
'modernization levy' will bring additional revenues to the government while&#13;
providing an incentive to farmers who satisfactorily discharge their O&amp;M&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
28.   In addition to bearing the O&amp;M expenses below the distributary (or&#13;
structured) level, the farmers will contribute 20 per cent of the costs of&#13;
lining works in the distributary or minor in Stage II. The rationale here is&#13;
that lining is often the most expensive and desired intervention to increase&#13;
conveyance efficiency. However, it is also often poorly implemented and&#13;
maintained.   The demand for contributions from farmers is expected to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 14 of 22&#13;
that the right priority will be accorded to this improvement, that selective&#13;
rather than full lining would be undertaken, and that careful attention and&#13;
farmer monitoring would follow. In addition, as already noted, farmers will&#13;
contribute in-kind to the completion of OFD works.&#13;
Lecal basis&#13;
29.   The formal registration of FCs and other farmers' organizations in the&#13;
WRCP will be as per the Tamil Nadu Societies' Registration Act, 1975. The Act&#13;
provides for a democratic framework for farmers' organizations and their&#13;
governance, including registration, periodic elections to management&#13;
positions, transparent sharing of information among the members and for the&#13;
formation of federations. The office of the State Registrar of Societies will&#13;
receive annual reports and audited financial statements from the farmers'&#13;
organizations.&#13;
30.   There is no comprehensive act in Tamil Nadu (as in the case of the State&#13;
of Maharashtra, for instance) for irrigation and drainage management.   In its&#13;
absence, the Societies Registration Act will provide the framework for&#13;
incorporation. A Government Order will be issued to the WRO prior to the&#13;
start of the project requiring the establishment of farmer organizations and&#13;
declaring the decision of turnover of management below the structured level&#13;
from the WRO to these organizations. The legal transfer of management&#13;
responsibility (not including the transfer of ownership rights over assets)&#13;
will be defined through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be signed&#13;
between the FCs and the WRO. Sample contents of an MOU are shown in Attachment&#13;
C. The MOU will specify the obligations and benefits of the transfer&#13;
arrangement; the conditions under which the Council will engage in Joint&#13;
Management of the distributary during a transition period of 3 to 9 months;&#13;
and the conditions for full transfer of O&amp;M responsibility.&#13;
31.   The State Water Policy recently approved by GOTN will emphasize the role&#13;
of farmers in water resources management and the policy of management turnover&#13;
to provide a general policy umbrella for WRO's actions. The Tamil Nadu&#13;
Panchayati (local governments) Act, currently under revision, is unlikely to&#13;
affect the irrigation sector specifically, but will support broad efforts to&#13;
induce local participation.&#13;
The Process of oraanizing farmer councils&#13;
32.   The process leading to O&amp;M turnover is presented in this section in&#13;
three phases: (1) assessment, (2) organizing, and (3) joint management,&#13;
leading to turnover. The process of organizing and turning over O&amp;M&#13;
responsibility will be basically similar for all schemes coming under the&#13;
WRCP, regardless of whether the particular scheme is undergoing Stage II&#13;
improvements (the case of the seven systems improved under NWMP) or are&#13;
starting fresh, under Stage I improvements. In either situation, the process&#13;
of organizing farmers will precede any construction activities at the&#13;
distributary level or below. The logic for this approach in to ensure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 15 of 22&#13;
farmers provide inputs into the design of improvements being carried out and&#13;
are committed to maintaining them once under their O&amp;H responsibility.&#13;
33.   Plans for Stage II improvements to the distributary canal and below&#13;
would be agreed with the FC, following a joint diagnosis of system&#13;
deficiencies carried out by means of a walk-through. In cases where the FC is&#13;
yet to be formally registered, agreement will be obtained from informal FCs.&#13;
Plans for Stage I improvements at the distributary and below will be discussed&#13;
with farmers as an integral part of the organizing process. A listing of the&#13;
improvements to be implemented under Stage I will form part of the provisional&#13;
MOU to be drawn up jointly by WRO and farmers, with the help of the FOT team.&#13;
This provisional MOU will serve as a common reference point in discussing the&#13;
mutual roles of the Council and the WRO. The MOU will be finalized at the&#13;
earliest once the works begin. The WRO will seek and record FCs' opinion on&#13;
satisfactory completion of works.&#13;
34.   Throughout the period of the project, FOT teams would be deployed for&#13;
work with farmers; 15 FOT teams will be deployed in the initial years with&#13;
subsequent adjustment in numbers as required. The FOT team will be supervised&#13;
by an Assistant Engineer (AE) and will include a Works Inspector (WI), and a&#13;
Lascar. Each team will cover about 3000 ha per year. The teams will work&#13;
with some starter farmer organizations, some advanced, and some "difficultw&#13;
ones. Good FOT team performance and well functioning FCs will be recognized&#13;
through annual awards and other incentives.   In any given distributary, the&#13;
time from assessment to turnover is anticipated to take between 12 to 18&#13;
months, but organizing efforts will not begin in all distributaries&#13;
simultaneously. A two-year period is planned for each round of organizing&#13;
activities, and once the project is fully underway, two rounds would be under&#13;
implementation simultaneously (see Attachment B).&#13;
a)    Assessment Phase (about 3 months): The FOT team will be trained at&#13;
IMTI prior to taking the field. The team's initial activity will&#13;
be to arrange participatory walk-throughs of each distributary,&#13;
along with WRO project staff and farmers, to begin a dialogue&#13;
about priority improvements. Other tasks during this phase&#13;
include compiling a list of actual farmers and the landholders, a&#13;
detailed map of the official and actual command area (including&#13;
unauthorized water use), and a rough assessment of the&#13;
organizational capacity of farmers in each distributary area,&#13;
including information on any existing formal or informal&#13;
organizations. Each team will be assisted by a trained male and&#13;
female social organizer, to assist in the Assessment and&#13;
Organizing phases. Additionally, a cadre of experienced&#13;
Institutional Advisors will be deployed to guide the FOT teams and&#13;
provide advice to senior project staff regarding the&#13;
organizational efforts and the turnover process. The social&#13;
organizers and institutional advisers will be recruited as&#13;
consultants. A major information and education campaign will be&#13;
launched in this phase with the assistance of IMTI to provide an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 16 of 22&#13;
appreciation of the process for senior managers of the WRO and to&#13;
offer specific information on costs and benefits to farmers.&#13;
b)    OrganizIng Phame. (4-6 months):  The FOT team, with guidance from&#13;
the Institutional Advisor, will begin a long series of informal&#13;
meetings with farmers throughout the command to discuss issues&#13;
related to turnover. The women social organizers will meat with&#13;
women farmers and encourage their participation in both the&#13;
sluice-level and distributary-level organizations. A provisional&#13;
MOU will be drawn up as a reference for discussing the details of&#13;
the Council's eventual rights and responsibilities. Pending&#13;
formal registration, a provisional FC will be organized by the FOT&#13;
team. The WRO will consult with the FC concerning any&#13;
modifications to ongoing distributary-level improvements (Stage I&#13;
works), and negotiate the detailed terms of the MOU for transfer&#13;
of O&amp;M responsibility. Once the O&amp;M fund is collected, the MOU&#13;
can be signed.&#13;
c)    Joint Management Phase. (3-9 months): During this phase, the FCs&#13;
will learn how to manage the distributary. Farmers will work&#13;
closely with WRO field staff to understand how to read water&#13;
levels, and how to maintain the new improvements. With help from&#13;
the AE and other WRO staff, the Council will also develop an&#13;
operational plan for water distribution. Prior to formal&#13;
turnover, a test of the water flows will be conducted to ensure&#13;
that the physical facilities are in order. The WRO Executive&#13;
Engineer will then formally turn over responsibility to the FC.&#13;
35.   After the official turning over, WRO and the FC will discuss further&#13;
improvements to the distributary that can be implemented under the WRCP as&#13;
Stage II improvements. The AE will work with FCs to encourage the formation of&#13;
a project-level Apex Committee of FC presidents. The WRO will consult the Apex&#13;
Committee regarding main system improvements, interdistributary issues and&#13;
problems and requests for Stage II improvements. Well functioning Apex&#13;
Committees will be rewarded with a modest office-cum-training facility at the&#13;
scheme headquarters location.&#13;
ODeration and maintenance: clans and practice&#13;
36.    Infrastructural improvements and farmer participation described in the&#13;
preceding section will address some of the system deficiencies noted earlier.&#13;
These changes will be accompanied by an emphasis on O&amp;M. The WRO's O&amp;M program&#13;
will be managed by basin managers in four regions. A central O&amp;M office will&#13;
provide specialized services to maintain standards and review criteria of&#13;
performance. The functions and expectations of the specialized unit and that&#13;
of the basin manager are described elsewhere in this report.&#13;
37.   To begin with, O&amp;M in the entire system would be the responsibility of&#13;
the WRO. Later, as FCs are formed, registered, and funds collected for O&amp;M,&#13;
the responsibility for O&amp;M of distributaries/minors and below would be turned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 17 of 22&#13;
over by the WRO to FCs, while the WRO retains control over the headworks and&#13;
main system. operational plans will be developed in consultation with farmers.&#13;
This, of course, cannot be a one time exercise and would be reviewed every&#13;
year between the-WRO and the apex committee of the FCs.&#13;
O&amp;M mechanization&#13;
38.   The restricted period available each year for maintenance and scarcity&#13;
of labor during the agricultural season point to the need for mechanization.&#13;
The WRO's O&amp;M staff will be strengthened in their capacity to improve their&#13;
O&amp;M practices by the procurement of selected equipment like excavators, rock&#13;
breakers, clam shell, crawler tractors, tipping trucks and back hoes (Table&#13;
4). The equipment would be shared for construction works on by-pass channels&#13;
or rented out to FCs at a concessional rate to speed up the desiltation works.&#13;
At the same time, purchase of vehicles -- jeeps, cars, motor cycles, bicycles&#13;
-- would improve the mobility of the staff including those engaged in FOT&#13;
(Table 5). Communication would be improved through the use of mobile radios.&#13;
39.   Three new regional workshops will be constructed at Madras, Trichy, and&#13;
Aliyar. The Madurai workshop will be strengthened. The workshops will be&#13;
well equipped; two fabrication workshops will be established at Trichy and&#13;
Madurai.&#13;
Financina O&amp;M&#13;
40.   The GOTN has gradually increased its annual budget for O&amp;M and has&#13;
allocated funds separately for works portion and staff at the beginning of&#13;
each financial year. The funds are allocated to each executive engineer on a&#13;
quarterly basis through letters of credit drawn on a commercial bank.   The&#13;
budget for financial year 1994-95 is Rs. 265 per ha on an average of which it&#13;
is estimated that Rs. 150 per ha is for works portion.&#13;
41.   Under the WRCP, each structure and canal reach will be inspected&#13;
annually and budget will be provided to meet the requirements of full funding&#13;
of maintenance.   Importantly, the funding requirement will be based on&#13;
specific and objective scheme level performance assessments. To assist scheme&#13;
staff in preparing the O&amp;M requirements, a maintenance manual indicating&#13;
guidelines for carrying out repairs and an asset register for each scheme in&#13;
which inventory and state of assets registered annually will be prepared.&#13;
Consultants, whose terms of reference are to be agreed upon with the Bank,&#13;
will be appointed to assist in the preparation of these manuals and registers.&#13;
42.   FCs will take over OhM functions of the part of the system below the&#13;
distributary/minor head and maintain it. To this end, they will use the&#13;
interest from the fixed deposit collected from each farmer on entry into the&#13;
FC. In addition, they will organize special projects for immediate repairs to&#13;
the system under their management control if the situation warrants it. The&#13;
GOTN will consider whether a portion of any charges levied on farmers for the&#13;
rehabilitation/ modernization improvements as a result of the WRCP could be&#13;
shared with FCs. Conditions for such sharing would be a well-functioning FC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 18 of 22&#13;
with a proven record for at least one year of effective O&amp;M in the system&#13;
turned over to their control.&#13;
43.   Budgetary procedure.  Tamil Nadu has established a satisfactory&#13;
arrangement for the preparation of the budget and allocation of O&amp;M funds for&#13;
different schemes. The CE (Irrigation) at Madras coordinates all activities,&#13;
obtaining government approvals and allocating the funds to SEs and EEs&#13;
responsible for O&amp;M in the various schemes.&#13;
44.   The budget process starts early, usually in August, in the financial&#13;
year (April-March). The SE (O&amp;M) in a scheme reviews the proposals presented&#13;
by the EE in August and, in turn, submits his proposal to the CE (Irrigation)&#13;
in September. The CE : (i) finalizes the revised budget for the current&#13;
financial year after taking note of the progress made on O&amp;M, expenditure&#13;
incurred ad the balance amount needed for the coming months; and (ii)&#13;
estimates the budget needed for the next financial year. He then submits his&#13;
proposal to the Secretary, Finance through the Secretary, PWD every September.&#13;
The Secretary, Finance informs the PWD of the final budget allocation for&#13;
every scheme in November/December. Information on the budget for the&#13;
following financial year is conveyed to the CE after it is voted in the State&#13;
legislature in February/March. The CE informs the SE/EEs of their budgets.&#13;
The EEs are authorized to incur expenditure on O&amp;M through letters of credit&#13;
issued by the Finance Department, on a quarterly basis, supported by a&#13;
recommendation of the CE. The early allocation of budget has helped the EEs&#13;
in planning their O&amp;M works without difficulty. However, the problem was the&#13;
amount of funds provided in the past.&#13;
Training&#13;
45.   The largest training effort will be the preparation of the WRO staff to&#13;
meet the challenges of the new thrust on O&amp;M and farmer participation. In the&#13;
case of the latter, a major training effort will be launched with IMTI as the&#13;
nodal agency. IMTI will involve other training and research institutions and&#13;
NGOs in Tamil Nadu as well as private consultants with experience in farmer&#13;
organization.&#13;
46.   FOT Training. The FOT training program would include:  appreciation&#13;
workshop for senior managers and project staff; specific skill building&#13;
workshops for the FOT team and for FCs. Details of the training programs&#13;
planned and their proposed schedule is in Attachment D. The FOT program will&#13;
also provide IMTI an opportunity to develop a systematic set of instructional&#13;
material for farmer organization that could be of great use to Tamil Nadu and&#13;
of some interest to other States in India. Resources have been provided to&#13;
develop case studies and teaching material as well as for collaborative&#13;
initiatives with other institutions involved in farmer organization and&#13;
related efforts such as Anna University, Gandhigram, and the Tamil Nadu&#13;
Agricultural University.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 19 of 22&#13;
47.   In view of the importance of the training effort in the success of the&#13;
FOT, it has been agreed with GOTN that it is of the utmost importance to&#13;
infuse stability and strength to the institution.   In the past, although IMTI&#13;
was set up as a training institution, not all staff or directors posted there&#13;
were motivated by the training function.  Directors have been posted for short&#13;
periods of time. Staff on deputation from other departments have not been&#13;
allowed to stay for more than three years if they wished to, and if IMTI found&#13;
them to be good. A 'core" group of faculty was chosen some five years ago but&#13;
is yet to be so designated. To rectify this situation, it has been agreed&#13;
that a "corew faculty group will be designated and that the full complement of&#13;
faculty will be recruited. Where it is not possible to get staff on&#13;
deputation, contractual and consultancy arrangements will be tried.&#13;
48.   Irrigation Management Training. The project would also support training&#13;
in the following areas:&#13;
a)    Management skills -- IMTI at present offers a series of training&#13;
courses for supervisory skills. These course will be reviewed&#13;
with consultancy assistance as part of the project and redesigned&#13;
an necessary. In addition, IMTI would enter into a collaborative&#13;
agreement with a reputed management training institution to offer&#13;
a condensed program of management skills for those already at, or&#13;
are about to move into, senior management level.&#13;
b)    Performance assessment -- Irrigation managers would be trained in&#13;
system diagnostic techniques for application to their own field&#13;
settings. IMTI would continue its training programs on this&#13;
subject, using material from its ongoing collaborative program&#13;
with IIMI, Sri Lanka, which could be expanded.&#13;
c)    Equipment operator and maintenance training -- as part of the&#13;
purchase contract for new equipment and vehicles, suppliers will&#13;
be asked to provide operation and maintenance training to&#13;
mechanical staff in WRO. As for specialized maintenance of&#13;
electronic communication, data processing and computer equipment,&#13;
initial training will be provided by suppliers as part of purchase&#13;
contracts, to be followed up at IMTI.&#13;
d)    Water control, distribution and measurement -- training of staff&#13;
in this area will be provided by IHH, Poondi and by consultants&#13;
from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and CWPRS, Puns.&#13;
0)    Maintenance of drainage channels -- The canal and drainage O&amp;M is&#13;
part of the same organizational hierarchy in Tamil Nadu. The CZ&#13;
(O&amp;M) and river basin managers will arrange for training in O&amp;M of&#13;
drainage channels, including annual workshops with the assistance&#13;
of consultants. Annual training budgets and plans will be&#13;
provided by each basin manager for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 20 of 22&#13;
f)    The project will support national and international study tours on&#13;
selected topics from the above list of subjects.   These tours&#13;
will be planned as part of an annual program of training, and&#13;
reviewed each year during the formal annual review.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
49.   The GOTN will set up a systematic program of monitoring the Systems&#13;
Improvement and Farmer Turnover component of the project. Performance&#13;
indicators for the component are suggested in Attachment E.&#13;
50.   Systems Improvement. Apart from the operational plan, O&amp;M performance&#13;
will be evaluated annually, in association with FCs. Annual reports for each&#13;
command will be published by basin managers. The report will detail O&amp;M&#13;
achievements, actual and budgeted expenditures, and planned performance&#13;
targets for the next year.&#13;
51.   The project would support the use of modern monitoring tools.  For&#13;
instance, sensors at critical locations will be used to monitor levels and&#13;
flows in the main canal systems. Remote sensing data will be used to monitor&#13;
impact. These data can be processed in near real time to provide estimates of&#13;
crop acreage, crop condition, optimum design for crop cutting experiments,&#13;
crop yield estimation and overall system performance.   Annual monitoring can&#13;
lead to evaluation of system performance through the years to identify areas&#13;
requiring intensive follow up action. Concurrent monitoring through the season&#13;
could provide early indications of moisture stress or crop damage for&#13;
corrective action. Surveys for all WRCP schemes will be carried out during&#13;
the first year with the assistance of the National Remote Sensing Agency&#13;
(NRSA) at Hyderabad, Anna University, Madras and IWS in WRO. IWS would&#13;
gradually develop capacity in remote sensing techniques and undertake&#13;
increasing responsibility in the application of such techniques for improving&#13;
water resources management in the State.&#13;
52.   Farmer Turnover. The GOTN will also establish a program of monitoring&#13;
farmer organization and turnover. Indicators include assessment of inputs,&#13;
process and output. To complement the quantitative indicators, qualitative&#13;
assessments are also necessary. It is too easy to be satisfied with "numbers&#13;
of farmer organizations registered" without verifying whether these are&#13;
"paper, organizations or are "real" organizations where farmers know they are&#13;
members and are aware of rights and obligations. For this purpose, the&#13;
following have also been agreed to as monitoring devices : (1) The Basin&#13;
Manager and the CE (O&amp;K) will visit a sample set of sluice organizations,&#13;
farmer councils and apex committees at least three times a year to get direct&#13;
feedback from farmers about progress. These field visits will be in the&#13;
nature of rapid assessments;   (2)  meetings of institutional advisors who&#13;
will assist the FOT teams will be convened every month at the basin level to&#13;
obtain their views on issues and operational problems; (3) IMTI's visits to&#13;
the sites to assist FOT teams will also be used as a periodic source of&#13;
information for basin managers and the CE (O&amp;M) to gauge progress in FOT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 21 of 22&#13;
53.   In addition to these methods, every annual review of the project as a&#13;
whole will provide an opportunity to adjust original plans according to&#13;
current experience.&#13;
Risks&#13;
54.   The WRCP represents a significant shift in the government's approach to&#13;
water resources in general, and irrigation in particular. Whereas decisions on&#13;
system improvements so far in the State have been made in a top down fashion,&#13;
under the new arrangement, farmers will work with the WRO to determine the&#13;
best course of action. Some aspects of irrigation management, particularly&#13;
main system management, will remain within government's exclusive purview, but&#13;
even here farmers have legitimate interests in making their voices heard.&#13;
Similarly, below the distributary, farmers will have exclusive management&#13;
responsibility, with the WRO assisting in and monitoring farmers, performance.&#13;
55.   The public-private partnership required to make the new arrangement&#13;
function well calls for new kinds of skills and a markedly different attitude&#13;
on the part of both government and farmers. There is an inherent risk that&#13;
public bureaucracies may not easily undergo the necessary transformation. It&#13;
is also important to retain the autonomy of internal management of farmer&#13;
organizations so that they are not subject to bureaucratic and political&#13;
pressures. Much also depends on the stability and performance of key&#13;
institutions such as IMTI that will undertake a major training effort in both&#13;
the Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover activities.   The project will&#13;
address this risk through: (1) policy commitment to the SIFT program; (2)&#13;
specific administrative action to translate the commitment into action,&#13;
including decisions in the case of IMTI, to introduce stability and&#13;
consistency to its training programs; (3) training programs aimed at&#13;
engendering an understanding of the management logic underlying the new&#13;
arrangement, and imparting new skills, particularly in farmer organization and&#13;
turnover; (4) a transparent process of farmer organization in which existing&#13;
departmental staff steer the process with support from NGOs and specialists in&#13;
the field; (6) frequent monitoring and evaluation of the new arrangements so&#13;
that WRO staff remain well informed of progress and are challenged to propose&#13;
solutions to the inevitable difficulties of the SIFT component (See Box 2)&#13;

entirely as a means of cost recovery.  This view does not adequately take&#13;
incentives for farmers into account. Farmers' responsibilities should be tied&#13;
to service improvements and hence a transparent program of infrastructural&#13;
upgradation is a necessity. The promotion of a systematic scheme-by-scheme&#13;
program of system improvements and O&amp;M budgeting to be implemented under thi&#13;
WRCP would go a long way in mitigating this risk. There is also the danger of&#13;
inappropriate government subsidies for OhM or for OFD, although the GOTN has&#13;
agreed that the WRCP's OFD model would be applicable throughout the State.&#13;
Efforts to maintain this model must be made during project implementation so&#13;
that competing approaches that  emphasize subsidies are not supported.  The&#13;
tnnual Reviews of the project will offer an opportunity to assess progress in&#13;
the SIFT component and to take corrective action.&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
SCHEME COMPLETIONS&#13;
1.    This annex' deals with the nine schemes to be financed under WRCP which focus on&#13;
improving the source of supply of water to existing traditional infrastructure2. PWD (WRO) is&#13;
building small to medium sized dams in small rivers to mobilise on-channel storages and to use the&#13;
stored waters to provide assured full irrigation supplies, thus stabilizing production in areas under&#13;
partial irrigation and bringing gap areas3 which have gone out of irrigated agriculture back into&#13;
being high productive irrigated areas. Such schemes would alleviate moisture stress which is a&#13;
major constraint in improving agricultural production.  Some of these schemes to create&#13;
impoundments and to improve supply channel and tank conditions are under way with several under&#13;
planning stages.&#13;
2.    After reviewing a number of these schemes, nine schemes have been selected for assistance&#13;
under the IDA credit. The selection is based on soil and land suitability for growing a variety of&#13;
crops, possibility of increasing cropping intensities, water availability, marketability of the produce,&#13;
improvements in the living conditions of the farmers and economic performance of the scheme.&#13;
These schemes are: Poigalyar, Nambiyar, Sothuparai, Mordhana, Rajathopekanar, Kodumudiyar,&#13;
Vadakku Pachayar, Adavinainarkoil and Gridhammal II. Construction work is well under way for&#13;
the first five schemes. In four schemes a small amount of additional area which is under rainfed&#13;
dry crops at present would be brought under irrigated agriculture. Altogether 25,824 acres would&#13;
be stabilized, 6762 acres of gap and 2158 acres of rainfed uplands would be brought under&#13;
irrigation. Schemewise breakdown is given in Table 5.1.&#13;
3.    Engineering designs for all the nine schemes have been prepared by PWD (WRO). These&#13;
were reviewed by the preparation and appraisal missions and modified as required. Eight of the&#13;
nine schemes involve building dams higher than 9m and impounding reservoirs. Consultants were&#13;
appointed to carry out flood hydrology and dam safety studies under FAO/CP supervision and their&#13;
reports are on file. There is a Dam Safety Review Project established for Tamil Nadu already under&#13;
Cr.22410-IN/Ln.33250-IN. This panel has reviewed the upgraded designs and other parameters&#13;
developed by PWD (WRO) and the consultants and have approved the construction of these dams.&#13;
Adequacy of supply channels and other water control and delivery structures have been ascertained.&#13;
These schemes submerge relatively small areas of land and impound small reservoirs. The land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation of project affected persons is dealt with in detail in Annex&#13;
9.&#13;
4.    The cost estimates prepared by PWD (WRO) have been revised taking into account the&#13;
modifications in the designs. The unit rates adopted for various work items were examined and&#13;
found to be substantially lower than prevailing market rates. Past contracts were examined and they&#13;
I Detailed tables. figures, engineering drawings, and analysis for this annex are in the project files.&#13;
2 For background information on traditional irrigation infrastructure refer to appendix I of this annex.&#13;
3Stabilization and gap areas vary on a yearly basis depending on climatic conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 23&#13;
also revealed the same trend of contracts awarded exceeding the estimates by 30% to 40%. In order&#13;
to correct this situation, the unit rates provided by PWD (WRO) have been enhanced by 50% after&#13;
detailed discussions with a number of field engineers handling contract awards. The estimates can&#13;
therefore be considered as more realistic.&#13;
5.    Implementation capabilities of PWD (WRO) were assessed. Past performance indicated that&#13;
a division headed by an Executive Engineer with associated lower level staff is able to handle&#13;
construction work with a value of upto Rs3O to 50 million per year if there are no cash flow&#13;
problems. This has been taken into account in establishing the implementation duration for each&#13;
scheme.  Project procurement, contract packaging and contractor supervision and monitoring&#13;
arrangements are specifically designed to achieve maximum economies in construction costs while&#13;
maintaining good quality standards. Implementation schedules together with assumed contract&#13;
packages are given in Figure 5.1(i) through 5.1(viii).&#13;
6.    Benefits from implementing the scheme completions component would come from increased&#13;
agricultural production. Agricultural extension services in all the scheme commands are organized&#13;
following Training &amp; Visits (T &amp; V) principle which was introduced in the early 1980s. IDA credit&#13;
would be targeted specifically to source development, irrigation infrastructure development including&#13;
improvement of the operation and maintenance of the system under the WRCP. No specific&#13;
investments would be provided to the agricultural department in support of crop production in the&#13;
scheme commands. Therefore in the future with project situation, only crops already known to the&#13;
farmers of the area are included. Yield increases for these crops are restricted to that which can be&#13;
achieved by relieving moisture stress. Yields currently obtained under full irrigation conditions in&#13;
the scheme commands or adjacent commands have been used to reflect future with project&#13;
conditions. Existing agricultural extension services are expected to continue in the future. The nine&#13;
schemes when completed would generate incremental production of about 47,000 tons of paddy,&#13;
88,832 tons of sugarcane,and 5,234 tons of groundnut. Small increases in cotton and chilies&#13;
production would also be obtained. A beneficiary farmer without access to supplementary well&#13;
irrigation4 would be able to obtain incremental incomes of Rs1370 to Rs6106 per year per acre&#13;
depending on the scheme. Similarly a beneficiary farmer with access to supplementary well&#13;
irrigation would be able to obtain incremental incomes of Rs1552 to Rs4884 per year per acre&#13;
depending on the scheme.&#13;
7.    The estimated cost of this component is Rs3.11 billion (US$100.37 million) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. The base cost excluding these contingencies is Rs2.46 billion&#13;
(US$76.8 million). The annual economic value of the incremental production from the nine schemes&#13;
is Rs380 million. The economic rate of return for the portfolio of nine schemes is 15%.&#13;
Schemewise breakdown of costs, benefits and economnic performance are also given in Table 5.1.&#13;
8.    Operation and maintenance of the completed schemes would be carried out with full&#13;
beneficiary participation. Water users associations would be formed at each tank or sluice command&#13;
4 There are an estimated 4505 wells in the nine scheme commands capable of irrigating on the average about 0.9&#13;
ha each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

with an apex farmer organization (registered) for each scheme5. WRO would be responsible for&#13;
the maintenance of the dam and reservoir complex and all supply channels delivering water to the&#13;
tanks for the indirect ayacuts and upto sluices for direct ayacuts. The sluices and the tanks would&#13;
be under the joint responsibility of WRO and WUAs. Below the sluice and tank, operation and&#13;
maintenance would be the responsibility of the WUA.&#13;
9.    Specific aspects of each scheme are discussed in the following sections.&#13;
Poigaiyar Scheme&#13;
10.   There are eight system tanks fed by water diverted from the Poigai River and there are&#13;
another eight tanks which are rainfed from their own catchments. In addition there are a number&#13;
of farms that are cultivated using rainwater alone. By constructing a dam across this river and&#13;
impounding flood flows that would otherwise have gone to waste (Poigai river carries heavy flood&#13;
flows from the Northeast monsoon), the scheme would bring assured irrigation to the areas&#13;
commanded by the sixteen tanks and provide irrigation for a portion of the land currently under&#13;
rainfed cultivation. (system schematic, plan and other relevant maps are in project files)&#13;
11.   The Poigai Reservoir would be impounded behind an earth dam located on the Poigai River&#13;
near Aralvoimozhi village in Thovalai taluk of Kanyakumari District at Longitude 77030'45"E and&#13;
Latitude 8°16'00"N. The reservoir would have a live storage capacity of 2.7 MCM. The average&#13;
annual inflow into the reservoir is estimated to be 12.5 MCM. Catchment area contributing to this&#13;
reservoir is 2.85 sq.mile (730 ha). Poigai river, a tributary of Pazhayar river, originates at an&#13;
altitude of 2500 feet above mean sea level in the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats (Poigai&#13;
Mountain). On the other side of Poigai mountains, there are two odais6 namely Chungan Odai and&#13;
Erappaiyar Odai originating in the Poigai Mountain Reserved Forest. About 40% of the flows of&#13;
Chungan Odai are diverted to Poigai River.&#13;
12.   The Poigai River branches into two channels when it enters the plains: Shenbagaramanpudur&#13;
Channel and Thovala Channel. The Shenbagaramanpudur Channel is 2750m long and feeds three&#13;
tanks commanding a total area of 231.84 acres (93.86 ha). There are two diversion weirs across this&#13;
channel which control the waters flowing to these tanks. The Thovala Channel taking off on the&#13;
left flank of the Boothayan Anicut is 4780m long and feeds five tanks commanding a total area of&#13;
265.78 acres (107.60 ha).&#13;
13.   The scheme comprises the following engineering works:&#13;
- Earth Dam 1174m long&#13;
- Ogee shaped masonry spillway 56m long capable of passing the 1 in 10,000 year flood&#13;
safely.&#13;
5 Scheme commands vary from 545 acres to 8683 acres. one apex organization would normally cover an area&#13;
not greater than 5000 acres. Therefore for Mordhana and Vadakku Pachayar two apex farmer organizations would be&#13;
registered. For further details refer to the appropriate scheme description section.&#13;

- High Level Canal Sluice lno 0.90m x 1.50m Q = 47 cfs&#13;
- River Sluice Ino 1.22m x 1.83m Q = 100 cfs&#13;
- Excavation of spillway discharge channel 280m long to connect to a natural water course&#13;
- Improvements to the natural watercourse which is to handle spill flows ( for a distance of&#13;
about 475m from the confluence of the spill discharge channel and the natural watercourse)&#13;
- Excavation and lining of left side canal for a length of 7 km (this canal will deliver water&#13;
to the new area and the area under rainfed tanks)&#13;
- Excavation and lining of Field Bothies upto the 20 acre limit&#13;
- Standardising and improving the existing eight system tanks and the eight rainfed tanks&#13;
including provision of new inlets to the eight rainfed tanks which would receive regulated water in&#13;
the post-project period.&#13;
- The system tanks would be fed by regulated flows released through the river sluice located&#13;
in the body of the earth dam at 270+00 and the direct command would be fed by the regulated&#13;
releases from the canal sluice located at 90+00.&#13;
14.   Structures to be constructed on the Canal: 11 sluices, 1 regulator, 4 drops, 4 super passages,&#13;
6 aqueducts, 2 undertunnels, 3 culverts, 8 footbridges, 1 Highway Crossing Culvert and 1 Railway&#13;
Crossing Culvert. (Total 41 structures). The eleven sluices would feed the direct ayacut of 500&#13;
acres.&#13;
15.   The scheme command is covered by two agricultural extension centers. Farm inputs supply&#13;
and distribution are mainly handled by these two centers and ten village cooperatives. The area has&#13;
one farmer's training center as well. The soils of the scheme command are well-drained, moderately&#13;
coarse textured soils suitable for growing paddy, groundnut, pulses, gingely, tapioca, coconut and&#13;
fruit trees. The existing cropping pattern in the tank irrigation area is paddy (Pishanum) in the&#13;
northeast monsoon season followed by groundnut. In areas with supplementary well irrigation7,&#13;
banana is usually grown in a three-year rotation with Pishanum Paddy. Groundnut is grown in the&#13;
gap and dryland areas. The average annual rainfall in the command area is 716mm. Rain falls&#13;
heavily in June, October and November. Details of rain and other climatic parameters including&#13;
evapotranspiration computed using modified Penman-Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(i).&#13;
Crop calendar is provided in Figure 5.2. Water balance computations are on file. With completion&#13;
of the proposed works, paddy would remain the dominant crop and double-cropping of paddy would&#13;
be practiced within the limit of available water supply. Groundnut would be grown under irrigated&#13;
conditions.&#13;
16.   The estimated cost to complete this scheme is Rs 130.78 million (US$4.22 mrillion) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(i). At present&#13;
work on the earth dam has been completed. It would take another three years to complete this&#13;
scheme. Implementation schedule is provided in Figure 5.1(i). One division is sufficient to&#13;
complete the scheme construction activities.&#13;
17.   The scheme would generate an incremental production of 1586 tons of paddy, 190 tons of&#13;
groundnut, 150 tons of pulses, 75 tons of chilies and 4200 bunches of bananas. A beneficiary with&#13;
7 There are an estimated 25 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating 2.5 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 5 of 23&#13;
1.0 acre farm would obtain an incremental income of Rs3754 per year whilst a beneficiary with 2.5&#13;
acre farm having access to a well would obtain an incremental income of Rs3881 per year. Overall&#13;
cropping intensity would increase from 122% to 239%. Full benefits are expected to accrue from&#13;
1997 onwards although partial benefits would begin to accrue as early as 1995. The economic&#13;
internal rate of return for this scheme is estimated to be 12%.&#13;
18.   Sixteen water users' associations will be formed covering the sixteen tank commands and&#13;
eleven associations will be formed covering the direct ayacut. An apex farmer organization will be&#13;
formed and formally registered comprising representatives from these twentyseven associations.&#13;
Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank outlets and the sluices would be&#13;
the responsibility of the associations. The inlets to the tanks and the tanks themselves will be&#13;
maintained and operated jointly by the association and officers of the WRO. The dam and canal&#13;
system delivering water to the tanks and sluices will be maintained and operated by the WRO.&#13;
Nambiyar Scheme&#13;
19.   The Nambiyar River is the main source of irrigation water in Nanguneri Taluk of Tirunelveli&#13;
District. There are no storage facilities on the main stem of Nambiyar River. There are nine anicuts&#13;
from which the flood flows of Nambiyar River are diverted to feed sixty-eight tanks commanding&#13;
9073.72 acres. In addition there is one diversion weir on a minor tributary of the Nambiyar River&#13;
providing irrigation supplies for 110 acres through three tanks. It is proposed to build a storage&#13;
facility on the Nambiyar River between the seventh and eighth anicuts with a live storage capacity&#13;
of 2.33 MCM. The Nambiyar river originates on the eastem slopes of the westem ghats at an&#13;
altitude of 1650m above sea level in the Kalakad Reserve Forest Area. The river is fed by both&#13;
southwest and northeast monsoons.&#13;
20.   The scheme would benefit lands located below the seventh anicut and would cover lands&#13;
presently irrigated through forty tanks - 13 system tanks and 27 rainfed tanks. Thirteen system&#13;
tanks covered by the scheme, command an area of 655 acres and the twentyseven rainfed tanks&#13;
command an area of 767 acres (total 1422 acres). Three system tanks are located on the right bank&#13;
commanding an area of 110 acres. The combined storage capacity of the three system tanks is&#13;
about 1.02 MCM. These tanks were fed from waters diverted through the Kallankal Odai8 Anicut&#13;
which would be submerged by the new storage reservoir. A new channel will lead the water from&#13;
the reservoir to these three tanks (system schematic, maps and other relevant information can be&#13;
found in project files). In addition the dry ayacut to be brought under irrigation also lies on the&#13;
right bank. Eleven rainfed tanks located on the right bank would also be supplied from the right&#13;
bank main canal. These rainfed tanks have a combined storage capacity of 2.85 MCM and&#13;
command a total area of 353 acres. Six system tanks with a total storage capacity of 1.90 MCM&#13;
commanding an area of 324 acres and sixteen rainfed tanks with a total storage capacity of 1.07&#13;
MCM commanding an area of 414 acres located on the left bank would be supplied from the&#13;
reservoir by a left bank main canal. Four additional system tanks located on the left bank with a&#13;
total storage capacity of 1.64 MCM and a command area of 221 acres would be supplied through&#13;
8 Tributary of Nambiyar river referred to earlier.&#13;

channels taking off from the eighth and ninth diversion anicuts namely Tuttikulam and&#13;
Pulimankulam Anicuts.&#13;
21.   Engineering works include:  an earth dam about 10.40m high and 2370m  long, an&#13;
uncontrolled spill weir 240m long (from 1330+00 to 1570+00), two irrigation sluices (one to supply&#13;
areas located on the left bank of Nambiyar Iriver and the other to supply areas located on the right&#13;
bank), excavation of main supply canals leading from the irrigation sluices to the tanks,&#13;
improvements to two diversion anicuts and their supply channels, improvements to 40 tanks,&#13;
excavation of distributaries and field bothies in the new dry ayacut of 375 acres to be brought under&#13;
the scheme.The irrigation sluices would each have 1.20m x 1.65m opening and would be capable&#13;
of discharging upto 3.74 cumecs. The main canals will run for about ten days to fill their respective&#13;
tanks. The right bank main canal will have to run throughout the cropping season to supply the&#13;
direct ayacut which is situated in the head reaches of this canal. This reach from the dam to the&#13;
direct ayacut will be lined to minimize losses since the canal will be operating at far below its&#13;
design discharge for most of the time.&#13;
22.   The average annual flow entering the reservoir is estimated to be about 70 MCM. The flow&#13;
is highly variable as evidenced by the high coefficient of variation. Annual rainfall in the command&#13;
area averages about 740mm but is also highly variable as indicated by a C, value of 0.46. Within&#13;
the year, rain occurs predominantly in the months of October, November and December (59% of&#13;
annual rain falls in these three months and the remaining 41% is fairly uniformly distributed over&#13;
the remaining nine months). Rain and other climatic data including evapotranspiration values&#13;
computed using modified Penman-Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(ii). Details of rainfall,&#13;
flows and corresponding analyses are available in project files.&#13;
23.   Farm inputs supply and distribution are covered by two agricultural extension centers located&#13;
in the scheme area. A number of village cooperatives and private dealers also handle chemical&#13;
fertilizers and pesticides in the area. Typic Haplustalfs, deep calcareous soils with moderately fine&#13;
texture and Typic Ustorharts, shallow non-calcareous soils with moderately coarse texture are found&#13;
in the scheme command. The former is suitable for paddy-based cropping system and the latter for&#13;
non-paddy crops such as groundnut and pulses. The present cropping pattern is paddy (Pishanum)&#13;
followed by rainfed pulses in the tank irrigation area. In areas with supplementary well irrigation',&#13;
banana in a three-year rotation with paddy, cotton and chilies are grown. The gap area is planted&#13;
with rainfed pulses, groundnut and sesame. In the new dry ayacut to be brought under the scheme&#13;
groundnut and pulses are grown in the northeast monsoon season. In some of this new area with&#13;
access to well irrigation, vegetables (mainly tomato) are cultivated in rotation with groundnut under&#13;
irrigated conditions.With completion of proposed scheme works,paddy would remain the dominant&#13;
crop and vegetable and banana cultivation would continue without any increase in area cultivated.&#13;
The crop calendars are given in Figure 5.3. Water balance computations are on file.&#13;
24.   The estimated cost to complete this scheme is Rs173.93 million (US$5.61 million) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. Details of quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(ii). At&#13;
present work on left bank main canal, spillway and energy dissipator and causeway and some&#13;
9 There are an estimated 264 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating about 1.75 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 7 of 23&#13;
spillover works from previous year remain to be completed. It would take another three years to&#13;
complete this scheme. One division of the WRO would be sufficient to carry out the remaining&#13;
tasks. Implementation schedule including proposed procurement and contract packages is given in&#13;
Figure 5.1 (i).&#13;
25.   The scheme would generate an incremental production of 1842 tons of paddy, 346 tons of&#13;
groundnut,60 tons of pulses,12 tons of cotton and 24,500 bunches of bananas. A beneficiary with&#13;
1.0 acre farm would obtain an incremental income of about Rs2193 per year whilst a beneficiary&#13;
with 2.5 acre farm having access to well irrigation as well would obtain an incremental income of&#13;
Rs7O8O per year. Overall cropping intensity would increase from 128% to 186%. Full agricultural&#13;
benefits are expected to accrue from 1997. However, partial benefits are expected to accrue as early&#13;
as 1995. The economic internal rate of return for this scheme is estimated to be 12%.&#13;
26.   Water user associations will be formed for each benefitting tank and sluice command. An&#13;
apex farmer organization will be formed and registered for the scheme as a whole comprising&#13;
representatives from these associations. Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below&#13;
the tank outlets and sluices will be the responsibility of these associations. The inlets to the tanks&#13;
and the tanks themselves will be maintained and operated jointly by the association and the WRO.&#13;
The dam and canal system delivering water to the tanks and sluices will be maintained and operated&#13;
by the WRO.&#13;
Sothuparai Scheme&#13;
27.   The Sothuparai Reservoir would be impounded on the river Varahanadhi at Longitude&#13;
77028'04" and Latitude 10°07'45". Varahanadhi, a tributary of the Vaigai River drains about 323&#13;
sq.km up to its confluence with Vaigai far below existing Vaigai Dam and Reservoir Complex.&#13;
Berijam Lake located at the originating point of Varahanadhi is used mainly for water supply and&#13;
for irrigation. The lake has a storage capacity of 2.2 MCM. There are no man-made storage&#13;
facilities in the Varahanadhi system. There are four diversion anicuts commanding a direct ayacut&#13;
of 2107 acres and an indirect ayacut of 2519 acres. The Sothuparai scheme would benefit area&#13;
commanded by the first anicut namely Thalaiyuthukoil Dam. (Direct ayacut of 587 acres and&#13;
indirect ayacut of 1412 acres). Varahanadhi channel, 7980m in length, irrigates about 468 acres&#13;
through four open offtakes and one sluice. Thamaraikulam Rajavoikal, 4095m in length, irrigates&#13;
about 120 acres through fifteen sluices. Periakulam and Thamaraikulam tanks release waters&#13;
through three sluices-each to 722 acres and 371 acres respectively. Pappiampatti tank irrigates 319&#13;
acres through four sluices. These three tanks have a combined storage capacity of 3.18 MCM.&#13;
Varahanadhi channel takes off from a road culvert with five 1.05m x 1.20m vents. Along the&#13;
channel there are four diversion anicuts and at the entrance to Thamaraikulam Rajavoikal there is&#13;
a tail dam. In addition to providing improved and assured supplies to this area, the scheme would&#13;
also bring in about 1040 acres of upland under assured irrigation.&#13;
28.   Varahanadhi drains approximately 49 km2 at the damsite. The reservoir created would have&#13;
a storage capacity of 2.8 MCM. The average annual inflow to the reservoir is estimated to be 6.1&#13;
MCM. Average annual rainfall in the command area is 813mm. Rain distribution through the year&#13;
together with data on other climatic parameters and evapotranspiration values computed using&#13;
modified Penman-Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(iii). About sixty percent of the rain falls&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 8 of 23&#13;
in the September-December period with another twenty percent in the April-May period. The&#13;
remaining twenty percent is fairly evenly distributed in the remaining six months.&#13;
29.   Sothuparai dam which is under construction, is a solid gravity masonry dam 57m high and&#13;
345m long. Flood flows would be handled by an uncontrolled 55m long spillway capable of passing&#13;
a 10,000-yr flood safely. Irrigation water would be released from the reservoir through a 1.50m x&#13;
1.80m river-cum-canal sluice. Irrigation water for the new ayacut will be provided through a&#13;
7.23km lined canal taking off from the Varahanadhi Channel downstream of the existing&#13;
Thalaiyuthu Dam. The canal is designed to carry 0.29 cumecs. Seven sluices would be provided&#13;
along this channel to irrigate the new ayacut (figure 5.6 refers). The masonry dam has been divided&#13;
into twelve blocks and a corewall. Work has been taken up in ten blocks leaving Blocks III and&#13;
IV for river flow. In Blocks I and II, pegmatite zone was encountered. Considerable delay in&#13;
construction work in these blocks was experienced until a decision on the handling of the pegmatite&#13;
zone was made. Various geological solutions were suggested by experts but final decision was&#13;
made by the PWD to completely remove the pegmatite. Work is currently under way in these&#13;
blocks.A construction diversion sluice would be constructed in Block II. After the completion of&#13;
this sluice river water would be diverted through this block and work would be taken up in Blocks&#13;
III and IV. In the remaining blocks, excavation and foundation concreting has been completed.&#13;
Masonry construction is at varying degree of completion in these blocks. Construction of Core wall&#13;
is awaiting the release of necessary land from the Forestry Department. Work is progressing in the&#13;
stilling basin area. Excavation of 2.23km of main canal has been completed and further work is in&#13;
progress. In the canal there would be one pick-up weir cum head sluice, twentyfour superpassages,&#13;
one Im canal drop, two undertunnels, sixteen aqueducts, eight canal syphons, three footbridges, five&#13;
culverts and a tail dam. Out of these, nine structures have been completed and work is in progress&#13;
in the remaining fiftytwo. A head sluice with screw gear shutter would be provided at the entrance&#13;
point of the main canal taking off from Varahanadhi channel. Similar shutter arrangements would&#13;
be provided at the seven sluice points as well.&#13;
30.   The scheme command is covered by three agricultural extension centers. Farm inputs supply&#13;
and distribution are mainly handled by the above extension centers, three cooperatives and eight&#13;
private dealers. Typic Haplustalfs, deep calcareous soils with moderately fine texture and Typic&#13;
Ustorharts, shallow non-calcareous soils with moderately coarse texture are found in the scheme&#13;
command. The former is suitable for paddy-based cropping system and the latter for non-paddy&#13;
crops. Crops grown at present are paddy, groundnut, sugarcane, cotton, sorghum and sesame. In&#13;
the future areas under some of these crops would be increased and dryland crops such as sorghum&#13;
and sesame would be dropped from the cropping pattern. Crop calendars are given in Figure 5.4.&#13;
Water balance computations have been carried out taking into account the availability of&#13;
supplementary irrigation from wells'". Sugarcane cultivation would be increased in order to&#13;
supply canes required by a recently established sugar mill in the scheme area. In the new area&#13;
brought under irrigation, groundnut would remain the main crop in the northeast monsoon followed&#13;
by some cotton and chilies. Areas that do not have supplementary well irrigation, would grow&#13;
samba paddy as the main crop in the northeast monsoon season followed by some groundnut within&#13;
the limit of the available water supply.&#13;
10 There are an estimated 772 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating about 2.5 ha each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 9 of 23&#13;
31.   The estimated cost to complete this scheme is Rs4l1.7 million (US$ 13.28 million) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(iii). It would&#13;
take another five years to complete this scheme and two divisions have to be assigned to accomplish&#13;
this instead of the one division currently engaged in the construction activities. Implementation&#13;
schedule is given in Figure 5.1(iii).&#13;
32.   The scheme would generate incremental production of 39,230 tons of sugarcane, 251 tons&#13;
of groundnut, 134 tons of cotton and 192 tons of chilies. A beneficiary with 1.5 acre farm would&#13;
obtain an incremental income of about Rs3437 per year whilst a beneficiary with 2.5 acre farm&#13;
having access to well irrigation would obtain an incremental income of Rs 11,547 per year. Overall&#13;
cropping intensity would increase from 103% to 131%. Full agricultural benefits are expected to&#13;
accrue from 1998 onwards. However, partial benefits are expected to accrue as early as 1996. The&#13;
economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 11.2%, not including secondary benefits;&#13;
including secondary benefits from activities such as fisheries, would raise the ERR above 12% (see&#13;
analysis in Annex 14).&#13;
33.   Water user associations will be formed at each of the ten tanks and the twentysix sluices.&#13;
An apex farmer organization will be formed and registered for the scheme as a whole comprising&#13;
representatives from these associations. Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below&#13;
the tank outlets and sluices will be the responsibility of these associations. The inlets to the tanks&#13;
and the tanks themselves will be maintained and operated jointly by the association and the WRO.&#13;
The dam and canal system delivering water to the tanks and sluices will be maintained and operated&#13;
by the WRO.&#13;
Mordhana Scheme&#13;
34.   The Mordhana Scheme would be located on the Koundinyanadhi, a tributary of the Palar&#13;
river. There are no storage facilities built on the main stem of this river. Fortyfour supply channels&#13;
draw water from the river and supply water to a direct ayacut area of 4046 acres and an indirect&#13;
ayacut of 4175 acres supplied through 17 tanks. The objective of this scheme is to provide a&#13;
storage facility on the main stem of the river to regulate the flash floods and deliver water to the&#13;
ayacuts and stabilize an area of 6388 acres and provide irrigation to the gap area of 704 acres.&#13;
35.   The Mordhana dam would be located at Longitude 78°47'E and Latitude 13°03'N. The&#13;
catchment area of Koundinyanadhi at Mordhana damsite is 1431 sq.km of which 1069 sq.km lies&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh,354 sq.km lies in Karnataka and 10 sq.km lies in Tamil Nadu.The average annual&#13;
inflow to the reservoir created at this site is estimated to be 110 MCM. However the flow in the&#13;
river is highly variable. During the period 1978-1992, the minimum annual flow at the damsite was&#13;
1.6 MCM and the maximum recorded annual flow was 654 MCM. The live storage capacity of the&#13;
reservoir would be 6.5 MCM. The reservoir would be impounded behind a masonry dam 470m&#13;
long and about 24m high at the maximum section. The size of the resevoir is such that even if&#13;
major consumptive use schemes are executed in the territories of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka,&#13;
(which is highly unlikely since the river traverses mostly through forest zone in these States), there&#13;
would be sufficient water to fill the reservoir as designed. The mean annual rainfall in the&#13;
command area is 886mm. About 90% of the rain falls during May-November period. Rainfall and&#13;
other climatic particulars including evapotranspiration values computed by modified Penman-&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 10 of 23&#13;
Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(iv). Inter-annual variation of rain is not very high although&#13;
intra-monthly variation of rain is quite high. Flood flows would be handled by a 398m long"&#13;
uncontrolled spillway capable of passing the routed 10,000-yr flood safely. The crest of the spillway&#13;
will be of ogee type with R.C.C. 1:2:4. The bodywall of the spillway will be in CR masonry in&#13;
cement mortar 1:3 with chisel dressed stones for its front and rear faces of 45cm thickness and the&#13;
core wall will be in RR masonry in cement mortar 1:4. A 24m long stilling basin with suitable&#13;
endsill would be provided to ensure safe dissipation of energy.&#13;
36.   A main canal will deliver irrigation releases from the reservoir to the direct ayacuts and the&#13;
tanks commanding indirect ayacuts. This arrangement is to avoid leaving the irrigation flows in the&#13;
river to be picked up at the off-take points. Since the maximum irrigation release would be in the&#13;
order of about 8 cumecs only, the river cannot be used as a delivery mechanism particularly in the&#13;
navarai12 cropping season. The main canal would be located on the left bank of Koundinyanadhi.&#13;
It would traverse through eighteen villages and terminate in the command area of Kalinjur Village&#13;
at 44+650. The canal would be divided into thirteen reaches and in the end of the second reach&#13;
would feed a branch canal which would cross the Koudinyanadhi and supply ayacut located on the&#13;
right bank of Koundinyanadhi (1480.27 acres). Eleven distributaries would take off from the main&#13;
canal to irrigate lands located on the left bank of Koundinyanadhi and Palar (1789.14 acres +&#13;
1696.54 acres). The main canal would have a bed slope of 1 ft per mile and would be designed for&#13;
a flow velocity of about 2 ft/sec.(see table of areas commanded by distributaries and the canal and&#13;
tank system). Unlined earth canal, regulator and head sluice for branch canal, head sluices for&#13;
distributaries, cross drainage structures, syphons, bridges and road culverts would be constructed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
37.   The scheme command is covered by six agricultural extension centers located at each block&#13;
involved in the scheme. Farm inputs supply and distribution are mainly handled by the above&#13;
extension centers and a number of village coperative societies and private dealers. Typic Ustrepepts,&#13;
deep, moderately coarse textured calcareous soils, Fluventic Ustrepepts and Udic Haplustalfs which&#13;
are deep, moderately fine textured, non-calcareous soils are found in the scheme command. These&#13;
soils are generally suitable for all crops grown in the scheme command. About 85% of the cropped&#13;
area is paddy and the remaining is sugarcane and pulses. Paddy yields vary depending on the level&#13;
of moisture stress. Main constraint to production increase in the scheme command is lack of&#13;
adequate and guaranteed water supply to the crops. In the future, area under sugarcane can be&#13;
expected to increase with greater reliability of water. At present, where groundwater facilities are&#13;
available to supplement tank irrigation13, several paddy-based cropping systems are practiced:&#13;
double cropping of paddy (Samba - Navarai), triple cropping of paddy (Samba - Navarai -&#13;
Sornavari) and paddy followed by sugarcane in a three-year rotation. The gap area is usually&#13;
planted with rainfed pulses. With completion of proposed works, Paddy area under Navarai would&#13;
increase considerably and there would also be a substantial increase in sugarcane area. Paddy would&#13;
1 This length is included in the 470m length quoted for the masonry dam.&#13;
12 Navarai cropping season extends from January-April when there is minimal rain and minimal or no flow in&#13;
the river.&#13;
13 There are an estimated 800 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating about 2.5 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 11 of 23&#13;
remain the domninant crop and triple cropping of paddy would be practiced within the limits of&#13;
available water supply. Crop calendars are given in Figure 5.5.&#13;
38.   The estimated cost to complete the scheme is Rs659.21 million (US$21.26 million) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(iv). It would&#13;
take another six years to complete the remaining works. Implementation schedule is given in Figure&#13;
5. 1(iv).&#13;
39.   The scheme would generate an incremental production of 9383 tons of paddy, 29,250 tons&#13;
of sugarcane, 213 tons of pulses and 941 tons of groundnut. It is estimated that a total of 4185&#13;
families would benefit from the scheme. A beneficiary with a 1.5 acre farm would obtain an&#13;
incremental income of Rs5000 annually whilst a beneficiary with a 2.5 acre farm having access to&#13;
supplementary well irrigation would obtain an incremental income of Rs1O,395 per year.&#13;
Employment opportunities would be provided by the scheme to about 8000 to 10,000 farm workers.&#13;
Overall cropping intensities would increase from 127% to 185%. Full benefits are expected to&#13;
accrue from year 2000. Partial benefits are expected to begin to accrue from 1997 based on&#13;
expected rate of completion of the main canal and distributaries. The economic internal rate of&#13;
return is estimated to be 13%.&#13;
40.   Water user associations will be formed at each of the benefitting tank and sluice command.&#13;
Two apex farmer organizations will be formed at the scheme level comprising representatives from&#13;
these associations. Operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank outlets and&#13;
sluices will be the responsibility of these associations. The inlets to the tanks and the tanks&#13;
themselves will be maintained and operated jointly by the association and the WRO. The dam and&#13;
canal system delivering water to the tanks and sluices will be maintained and operated by the WRO.&#13;
Rajathopekanar Scheme&#13;
41.   The objective of this scheme is to stabilize and improve agricultural production in 545 acres&#13;
presently irrigated through five tanks which are fed by waters of the Rajathopekanar river through&#13;
an open offtake and an unlined channel delivery system. The Rajathope river originates in Andhra&#13;
Pradesh and after flowing for a short distance of 2km enters Tamil Nadu and travels another 5km&#13;
upto the proposed reservoir site. An earth dam 273m long with an additional 53m long spillway&#13;
and 1 1.87m high at its maximum section is being constructed at Longitude 79°04'55"E and Latitude&#13;
13°01'05"N. This dam on the Rajathopekanar river would impound a reservoir with a live storage&#13;
capacity of 0.78 MCM. The river drains 8.6 sq.km upto the damsite. The average annual inflow&#13;
to the reservoir is estimated to be 1.90 MCM. The five tanks have a combined storage capacity of&#13;
1.6 MCM. The constraint in filling these tanks with the existing arrangement is the low carrying&#13;
capacity of the supply channel which makes it difficult to tap the river flows which are quite flashy.&#13;
Under this scheme, some of the flash flows would be retained in the reservoir and released through&#13;
the canal sluice to the supply channel at the rate of about 20 cusecs. All the five tanks would be&#13;
filled in about 30 days.&#13;
42.   A river cum canal sluice would be provided at LS 134m of the earth dam. One vent of the&#13;
sluice would have a higher sill elevation of +283m to allow water to flow to the tanks through the&#13;
existing delivery channel. The other vent would have a sill elevation of +281m to discharge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 12 of 23&#13;
necessary flows to the river channel during low-flow or no-flow seasons. The canal vent would be&#13;
0.90m x 1.00m and would be capable of discharging 24 cusecs. The river vent would be 0.90m x&#13;
1.50m. A 53m long spillway would be provided from LS 137m to 190m taking advantage of the&#13;
availability of good rock strata at this location at reasonable depth. A connecting channel 10 to 15m&#13;
long would be excavated to deliver the spill flows to the Rajathopekanar river.&#13;
43.   The scheme command is covered by two agricultural extension centers located at each block&#13;
involved in the scheme. Farm inputs supply and distribution are mainly handled by the above&#13;
extension centers and a number of village cooperative societies and private dealers. Agricultural&#13;
research works for the scheme command are conducted by two research stations at Virinjipuram&#13;
(crop research) and Melallathur (sugarcane research). Udic Haplustalfs, deep, moderately fine&#13;
textured, non-calcareous soils and Typic Ustochrepts, deep, moderately fine textured, calcareous soils&#13;
are found in the scheme command. These soils are moderately suited to paddy-based cropping. The&#13;
existing cropping pattern in areas without supplementary irrigation is Samba in the northeast&#13;
monsoon season followed by Navarai season paddy limited by water availability in the tanks. In&#13;
areas with supplementary well irrigation",double cropping of paddy is the dominant cropping&#13;
pattern with triple cropping of paddy and a three-year rotation of paddy with sugarcane or banana&#13;
practiced in a small area. In other areas samba paddy is usually followed by pulses grown with the&#13;
residual moisture of the previous paddy crop. With the completion of scheme works and the&#13;
availability of secure and increased water supply, it is expected that some increase in the sugarcane&#13;
and banana areas and triple cropping of paddy would take place. Average annual rainfall in the&#13;
command area is 886mm. About 90% of the rain falls during May-November period. Details of&#13;
rainfall and other climatic parameters including evapotranspiration values computed using modified&#13;
Penman-Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(iv). Crop water requirements have been estimated&#13;
for proposed cropping patterns. Crop calendars are provided in Figure 5.6. Water balance&#13;
computations have been carried out to establish water availability for the scheme and are on file.&#13;
It has been determined that together with the existing wells and storages and yields that can be&#13;
mobilized in the system tanks, the scheme would have adequate water to meet the crop water&#13;
requirements. In addition water would be available for domestic use for the villagers living in the&#13;
vicinity of the command area of the scheme.&#13;
44.   The estimated cost to complete the remaining works is Rs4O million (US$1.3 million)&#13;
including physical and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(v).&#13;
It would take another two years to complete the scheme. Implementation schedule is given in&#13;
Figure 5.1(v).&#13;
45.   The scheme would generate an incremental production of 2760 tons of sugarcane, 50,400&#13;
bunches of banana and 189 tons of paddy. It is estimated that 300 families would benefit from the&#13;
scheme. A beneficiary with 1.5 acre farm holding would obtain an incremental income of Rs3,500&#13;
per year whilst a beneficiary with a 2.5 acre farm having access to supplementary well irrigation&#13;
would obtain an incremental income of Rs 11,968 per annum. In addition agricultural employment&#13;
opportunity would be created benefitting about 900 to 1000 farm laborers. Overall cropping&#13;
intensities would increase from 161% to 169%. Full benefits would begin to accrue from 1996.&#13;
14 There are an estimated 184 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating about 2.6 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 13 of 23&#13;
Some areas would start benefitting earlier and incremental production would begin by 1995 in a&#13;
third of the area. The economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 12%.&#13;
46.   Five water users' associations will be formed and will be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank outlets. The inlets to the tanks and the tanks&#13;
themselves will be maintained and operated jointly by the WUA and WRO officers. The dam and&#13;
canal system delivering water to the tanks will be maintained and operated by WRO. An apex&#13;
farmer organization will be formed and registered comprising representatives from the five WUAs.&#13;
Kodumudiar Scheme&#13;
47.   The scheme envisages construction of a 405m long and 28m  high dam  across the&#13;
Kodumudiar at Longitude 77°32'E and Latitude 08°26'N which would impound a 3.6 MCM&#13;
reservoir. The average annual inflow to the reservoir is estimated to be about 45 MCM. The dam&#13;
would be located at the confluence of Kodumudiar and Kombiar rivers. Below the confluence the&#13;
river is called Thamaraiar which is a tributary of Nambiyar. The Kombaiar river originates on the&#13;
eastern slopes of the western ghats at an altitude of 1400 masl. The stream travels for about 7km&#13;
before it joins the Kodumudiyar. Similarly Kodumudiyar originates in the eastern slopes of the&#13;
western ghats at an altitude of 1650 masl, and joins the Kombiar. The combined stream called&#13;
Thamaralar travels 2km to join the Nambiyar above the second anicut on the Nambiyar (the&#13;
Dalavoipuram anicut)'5. The commands developed under the Thamaraiar and Nambiyar river&#13;
systems are fed through a number of channels taking off from a series of anicuts across these rivers.&#13;
The Kodumudiyar is flowing on the right side of the Kombaiyar. Kombaiyar divides into two arms&#13;
and the right arm joins the Kodumudiyar. At this junction point a high-level contour canal called&#13;
the Valliyooran channel takes off and feeds the Valliyoor big tank and a series of tanks after flowing&#13;
for a distance of lOkms. There is a masonry anicut across Thamaraiyar which is the only anicut&#13;
across Thamaraiyar and is called Thamarai Anicut. An irrigation channel called Padalayar channel&#13;
takes off from this anicut on the right side and feeds four tanks besides irrigating some direct&#13;
ayacut. There are nine anicuts in the Nambiyar river complex. An irrigation channel takes off from&#13;
the second of these anicuts namely Dalavoipuram anicut. This channel is called the Vadamalayan&#13;
channel which feeds 36 tanks besides irrigating a direct ayacut of 696 acres. Improvements to&#13;
Padalayar, Valliyooran and Vadamalayan channel systems to achieve better water management and&#13;
to increase agricultural production and incomes in areas commanded by them would be the scope&#13;
of the Kodumudiyar Scheme to be financed under this project. Fifteen villages would benefit from&#13;
this scheme. About 1954 acres would be stabilized and another 1925 acres which are currently&#13;
classified as gap areas would be provided full assured irrigation through the construction of on-&#13;
channel storage on the Kodumudiar.&#13;
48.   Formation of a composite dam to a total length of 405m across Thamaraiar with earth section&#13;
from 0+00 to 270+00 and masonry section from 270+00 to 405+00 with the following breakdown:&#13;
river sluice from 270+00 to 279+00, uncontrolled surplus weir 279+00 to 328+00, canal sluice to&#13;
supply Valliyooran channel from 328+00 to 337+00 and a non-overflow section from 337+00 to&#13;
405+00. Excavation of surplus course for 175m. Improving and remodelling existing Padalayar,&#13;
15 Cross-reference should be made to Nambiyar scheme.&#13;

Page 14 of 23&#13;
Valliyooran and Vadamalayan channels and the tanks fed by these channels. River sluice would&#13;
discharge the flows required for Padalayar and Vadamalayan channels. The river sluice would have&#13;
a sill level of +136.00 and would be able to pass 450 cusecs. An R.C.C barrel 1.5m x 1.8m would&#13;
form the sluice which would be provided with service and emergency gates. The canal sluice would&#13;
have a sill level of +144.00 and would discharge into the Valliyooran channel. The barrel size&#13;
would be 2.0m x 2.8m and the sluice would be able to pass 1000 cusecs. The 175m long and 49m&#13;
wide surplus course would deliver the spill flows back to Thamaraiyar. Hard rock is exposed at the&#13;
surface in the vicinity of the spillway and therefore no additional energy dissipator is necessary.&#13;
Spill flows would be delivered to the rock bed.&#13;
49.   With the scheme, Valliyooran channel would receive water from the high-level canal sluice.&#13;
The channel would be improved to handle rush supplies upto 1000 cusecs. This channel would&#13;
deliver water to the four tanks in its system and carry flows to be diverted to 23 tanks of the&#13;
Vadamalayan system.  A cross-regulator would be constructed just above the entrance of&#13;
Valliyooran channel to the Valliyoor big tank and the existing left bank outlet would be improved&#13;
to divert required flows to the Vadamalayan channel to feed 23 tanks out of its 36 tank command.&#13;
The Padalayar channel takes off from Thamarai anicut and this channel would be improved to carry&#13;
495 cusecs to feed the four tanks and direct ayacut under its command.The Vadamalayan channel&#13;
taking off from the Dalavoipuram anicut has already been improved upto 3.1km of its 22.85km&#13;
length. Under the scheme a further 5km would be improved and lined to minimize conveyance&#13;
losses (this section passes through porous soils). The channel would be modified to handle 450&#13;
cusecs. This channel feeds 36 tanks - 13 are fed in the reach 0 to 8km. The remaining 23 would&#13;
be fed by flows diverted from the Valliyooran system as described above.&#13;
50.   The scheme command is covered by three agricultural extension centers. Farm inputs and&#13;
supply distribution are mainly handled by the extension centers. A number of village cooperative&#13;
societies and private dealers also handle chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the area. Typic&#13;
Ustropepts, moderately deep, medium textured soils and Typic Ustorthents, shallow, non-calcareous&#13;
medium textured soils are found in the scheme command. The former soils are suitable for paddy-&#13;
based cropping system and the latter for non-paddy crops. Present cropping pattern is paddy&#13;
(Pishanum) followed by pulses in the regular tank commands.  In areas having access to&#13;
supplementary well irrigation"6, double cropping - Kar paddy followed by Pishanum paddy,&#13;
Pishanum paddy followed by cotton or chilies - is practiced. In addition a small area of banana is&#13;
also cultivated in a three-year rotation with paddy (2-yr banana, 1-yr paddy). With completion of&#13;
the proposed works, it is expected that the existing irrigated command area including the gap area&#13;
would receive a more secure water supply. A slight increase in chilies, cotton and banana areas is&#13;
expected with the increase in available water under the scheme. Average annual rainfall in the&#13;
command area is 740 mm. Inter-annual rain variation is quite high as evidenced by a C, value of&#13;
0.46. About 50% of the rain falls in the months of October and November. Details of rainfall and&#13;
other climatic parameters including evapotranspiration values computed using modified Penman-&#13;
Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(ii). Crop water requirements have been estimated for&#13;
proposed cropping patterns. Water balance computations have been carried out to establish water&#13;
availability for the scheme and are on file. It has been determined that together with the existing&#13;
16 There are an estimated 903 wells in the project area capable of irrigating about 1.8 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

wells and storages and yields that can be mobilized in the system tanks, the scheme would have&#13;
adequate water to meet the crop water requirements for the cropping pattern given in Figure 5.7.&#13;
51.   The estimated cost of this scheme is Rs288.5 million (US$9.3 million) including physical&#13;
and price contingencies. Details of quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(vi). The scheme&#13;
works are in their very initial stages. Preliminary works such as formation of approach roads,&#13;
construction of houses for 0 &amp; M staff are in progress. The scheme can be completed in four years&#13;
if two divisions are employed at the construction site. Implementation schedule is given in Figure&#13;
5. 1 (vi).&#13;
52.   The scheme is expected to generate an incremental production of 11,556 tons of paddy, 1676&#13;
tons of groundnut, 454 tons of pulses, 237,000 bunches of banana, 78 tons of cotton and 18 tons&#13;
of chilies. A beneficiary with a 1.5 acre farm would obtain an incremental income of Rs5442 per&#13;
year whilst a beneficiary with 2.5 acres and access to supplementary well irrigation would obtain&#13;
an incremental income of Rs12,211 per annum. Overall cropping intensities would increase from&#13;
127% to 254%. Full benefits would begin to accrue after the completion of all the scheme&#13;
components from year 1998. The economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 24%.&#13;
53.   Water user associations will be formed for each benefitting tank and direct sluice command.&#13;
They will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank&#13;
and sluice outlets. An apex farmer organization comprising representatives from these associations&#13;
will be formally registered at the scheme level. The maintenance of the tanks including inlets and&#13;
outlets will be the joint responsibility of the WRO and the WUAs. The dam and canal system will&#13;
be maintained and operated by the WRO with inputs from the apex farmer organization.&#13;
Vadakku Pachayar Scheme&#13;
54.   The Pachayar basin drains about 250 sq.km. The Pachayar basin also gets water of the&#13;
Keelamanimuthar basin through Karumandiamman anicut situated on the western side of Pachayar&#13;
Hills and also from Netterikal anicut situated upstream of Karumandiamman anicut.There are twelve&#13;
anicuts across Pachayar and one across Vadakku Pachayar namely the Madathu anicut. Some of&#13;
the catchment area contributing to the flow in the river system is influenced by both the southwest&#13;
and northeast monsoons (catchment contributing to Keelamanimuthar diversions). Flood flows occur&#13;
in the October to December period and the withdrawal capacity of the channels at the various&#13;
anicuts being limited, most of the flow goes past the anicuts to the sea. On the average about 25&#13;
MCM is surplused at the last anicut on the Pachayar. It is proposed to form a reservoir across&#13;
Vadakku Pachayar'7 and constructing a diversion weir across Pachayar below the second anicut&#13;
and divert the flood flows through a 800m long feeder canal into the Vadakku Pachayar reservoir.&#13;
17 Reservoir across Pachayar was contemplated but dropped due to its submerging some valuable forest lands.&#13;
The current proposal to create an impoundment on the Vadakku Pachayar avoids such submergence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 16 of 23&#13;
55.   The scheme envisages the formation of an earth dam 3115m long and 20m high at the&#13;
maximum section impounding a reservoir across Vadakku Pachayar river"8 with a live storage&#13;
capacity of 12.4 MCM (expected to be filled twice a year). The dam would be constructed at&#13;
Longitude 77°31'45"E and Latitude 08032'30"N. Head sluice with three vents 2.8m x 2.5m each&#13;
would be provided with a total withdrawal capacity of 2369 cusecs. A scour sluice with one vent&#13;
2.8m x 2.5m would be provided as well.&#13;
56.   The average annual inflow to the proposed reservoir on Vadakku Pachayar is 18 MCM. In&#13;
order to augment this flow a 60m long diversion weir will be constructed across Pachayar river&#13;
below Thalai Anicut and the flood flows of Pachayar river will be diverted through an 800m long&#13;
feeder canal. The feeder canal will be lined to minimize cross-section required to handle the&#13;
diverted flows when passing through already developed and cultivated areas. Lining would be&#13;
75mm thick and made of 1:3:6 precast concrete slabs. The canal bed width would be 10m and full&#13;
supply flow depth would be 2.5m. Necessary cross-drainage structures would be constructed.Two&#13;
drop structures would be constructed to negotiate the fall in ground level at +500+00 and +800+00.&#13;
57.   An uncontrolled weir will be constructed at left flank end 122m long together with an&#13;
associated surplus course. The surplus course would be 300m long and would deliver the spill flows&#13;
to Pachayar river through a natural watercourse. The weir would be capable of passing 1281&#13;
cumecs, which is the routed outflow of the 10,000-yr flood, safely with minor encroachment on the&#13;
freeboard provided. The surplus course would have a bed width of 80m and at full flood flows&#13;
would flow at depths of around 2.5m. The natural watercourse would be widened wherever&#13;
necessary.Excavated earth from this component could be used for dam construction'9. Cross-&#13;
drainage structures would be provided as required.&#13;
58.   A 3300m long link canal will be excavated to deliver water from the reservoir to the&#13;
Nanguneriankal. The following structures will be constructed on the link canal: regulator with two&#13;
shutters 1.5m x 1.5m each at LS 50m, aqueducts at LS 250m and 2300m, culverts at LS 1350m and&#13;
3350m, and required cross-drainage structures. The canal would be lined with 1:3:6 precast slabs.&#13;
Bed width of the link canal would be 4m and the carrying capacity would be 282 cusecs. On the&#13;
branch canal the following structures will be built: one shutter 1.5m x 1.5m at the offtake point of&#13;
the branch channel together with a drop structure to handle a 2m drop, an aqueduct with five vents&#13;
of 6m span each at LS 250m - RCC trough 4m wide over RR masonry piers and abutment, culvert&#13;
at LS 1350m 4m span RCC slab on RR masonry abutments, aqueduct at LS 2300m to cross the&#13;
existing supply channel to Mudukulam - 2m span RC slab with RR masonry abutments.&#13;
59.   A river sluice will be constructed at 1300+00 of the main dam to deliver water to irrigate&#13;
existing and proposed ayacuts. The waterway size would be 1.53m x 1.83m and the discharge&#13;
capacity would be 298 cusecs.&#13;
18 Vadakku Pachayar River is a tributary of Pachayar River which in turn is a tributary of the Thambaraparani&#13;
River.&#13;
19 Tests have been carried out to determine the suitability of this soil for dam construction. Necessary credits&#13;
have been applied in the cost estimates to take this into account.&#13;

60.   In addition to the above, the following works will be financed under the project.&#13;
Improvements to Nanguneriankal, Seevalapperiankal, Madathu anicut channel,Palambathukal,&#13;
Padmaneri channel, Sambankulamkal, Devanallur channel, linking Madathukulamkal with&#13;
Pachalankal, by-pass channel for tanks below Devanallur tank, Nanguneri tanks. The Madathu&#13;
anicut chanel will be reformed to 3m bed width and 1.5:1 side slopes and lined with precast slabs&#13;
1:3:6 mix. The carrying capacity of the channel will be 3.10 cumecs. This channel feeds Pamban&#13;
kal, Pamban kulam, Poolan kulam and Pachayar Eravai.The Padmaneri channel would be reformed&#13;
to 5m bed width and 1.5:1 side slopes and lined with 1:3:6 precast concrete slabs. The carrying&#13;
capacity of this channel would be 3.92 cumecs.The Devanallur supply channel would be reformed&#13;
to 5m and 7m bed widths and 1.5:1 side slopes and lined with 1:3:6 precast concrete slabs&#13;
61.   By implementing this scheme, 1147 acres of gap would be bridged and 7536 acres existing&#13;
system tanks and 45 rainfed tanks) would be stabilized. The command area of this scheme is spread&#13;
over twenty-three villages of Nanguneri Taluk in Tirunelveli District.&#13;
62.   The rain measured at Nanguneri raingauge station is representative of the command area&#13;
rainfall. The average annual rainfall is 740mm with about 60% of the rain occurring in a three&#13;
month period (October-December).  Details of rainfall and other climatic data including&#13;
evapotranspiration computed using modified Penman-Monteith method are given in Table 5.2(ii).&#13;
63.   The scheme command is covered by three agricultural extension centers. Farm inputs and&#13;
distribution are mainly handled by the above centers. A number of village cooperative societies and&#13;
private dealers also handle chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the area. The Tamil Nadu&#13;
Agricultural Development Project (Cr.22150-IN) is operating in this area. Typic Ustropepts and&#13;
Typic Haplastalfs, deep, moderately fine textured, calcareous soils suitable for paddy-based cropping&#13;
system are found in the scheme command. The existing cropping pattern in the tank irrigation area&#13;
is mainly paddy (Pishanum) in the northeast monsoon season followed by rainfed pulses. In areas&#13;
with supplementary well irrigation , the dominant cropping pattern is double cropping of paddy.&#13;
Groundnut and banana are also grown in a small area in rotation with paddy under rainfed&#13;
conditions. Groundnut is also grown under rainfed conditions in paddyland with no irrigation water.&#13;
Paddy grown in the tank/well area produces relatively higher yields reflecting less water stress than&#13;
paddy grown in tank irrigation alone.&#13;
64.   With completion of the proposed works, it is expected that the existing irrigated area would&#13;
receive a more assured water supply and the gap area would become a more productive irrigated&#13;
area. Double cropping of paddy would be practiced to the extent possible within the limit of&#13;
available water supply (water balance computations refers). The cultivation of existing non-paddy&#13;
crops except pulses would continue under the scheme with an increase in their cropped areas. Crop&#13;
water requirements have been computed on the basis of the cropping pattern and calendar given in&#13;
Figure 5.8. Water balance computations are on file.&#13;
65.   The estimated cost of the scheme is Rs.451 million (US$14.55 million) including physical&#13;
and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(vii). It would take&#13;
20 There are an estimated 869 wells in the scheme command irrigating about 2.5 acres each.&#13;

seven years to construct this scheme. Two divisions would be needed in years 2, 3, 4 and 5.&#13;
Implementation schedule is given in Figure 5.1(vii).&#13;
66.   The scheme is expected to generate an incremental production of 7,142 tons of paddy, 2,564&#13;
tons of groundnut and 326,000 bunches of bananas. A beneficiary with 1.5 acre farm would obtain&#13;
an incremental income of Rs4,376 per year whilst a beneficiary with a 2.5 acre farm having access&#13;
to well irrigation would obtain an incremental income of Rs7,446 per year. Overall cropping&#13;
intensities would increase from 132% to 173%. Full benefits would start from year 2001. However&#13;
partial benefits would start as early as 1998. The economic internal rate of return is estimated to&#13;
be 12%.&#13;
67.   Water user associations will be formed for each benefitting tank and direct sluice command.&#13;
They will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank&#13;
and sluice outlets. An apex farmer organization comprising representatives from these associations&#13;
will be formally registered at the scheme level. The maintenance of the tanks including inlets and&#13;
outlets will be the joint responsibility of the WRO and the WUAs. The dam and canal system will&#13;
be maintained and operated by the WRO with inputs from the apex farmer organization.&#13;
Adavinainarkoil Scheme&#13;
68.   Hanumanadhi is a major tributary of Chittar river which in turn is a tributary of the&#13;
Thambaraparani River. Hanumanadhi originates on the eastern slopes of the Western ghats at an&#13;
altitude of 1570m.a.s.l. The river traverses 6.4km in the hilly region and a distance of 11.20km in&#13;
the plains before its confluence with the Chittar river above Veeraman anicut near&#13;
Veerakaralampudur village of Tenkasi Taluk. At the damsite the river drains about 16 sq.km. The&#13;
average annual inflow into the proposed reservoir is estimated to be 26 MCM21.&#13;
69.   At present irrigation water is being supplied through a system of tanks fed by small channels&#13;
taking off from the diversion anicuts constructed across Hanumanadhi. There are nine anicuts upto&#13;
the confluence point of Hanumanadhi and Karuppanadhi. The Hanumanadhi system comprises these&#13;
nine anicuts seving some 38 tanks. At present the ayacut under Hanumanadhi does not get assured&#13;
irrigation supply from the existing anicut system even though there is ample water resource potential&#13;
in the river. By constructing a dam and creating an impoundment, the irrigation system would be&#13;
converted from an anicut-based system to a reservoir-based system and the ayacut would be given&#13;
better assured irrigation supply during both cropping seasons.&#13;
70.   The scheme envisages the construction of a 680m long masonry dam, 43.70m high at its&#13;
maximum section across Hanumanadhi river impounding a reservoir of 4.9 MCM capacity. The&#13;
dam would be located at Longitude 77°14'06"E and Latitude 09°04'00"E. The entire structure&#13;
would be of stone masonry with foundation concrete. The structure would be founded on solid rock.&#13;
21 Based on data gauged from 1977 to 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 19 of 23&#13;
71.   Flood flows would be handled by a lOOm long spillway located in the middle of the above&#13;
masonry dam from LS 320+00 to LS 420+00. The spillway is capable of discharging 570 cumecs&#13;
which is the magnitude of the routed 10,000-yr outflow.&#13;
72.   Irrigation deliveries would be made through two sluices: Mettukal sluice and Karisalkal cum&#13;
river sluice. Mettukal sluice would be located at LS 260 to 265m with one opening 0.90m x 1.50m&#13;
capable of discharging 0.65 cumecs which would supply the existing dry ayacut of 243 acres and&#13;
other irrigated ayacut of 668 acres. Karisalkal cum river sluice would be located at LS 315 to 320m&#13;
with one opening 1.5m x 1.8m with a discharge capacity of about 4 cumecs feeding an ayacut of&#13;
5597 acres.&#13;
73.   Already a well defined canal system exists for the ayacuts commanded by the anicuts.&#13;
However for the new ayacut of 243 acres additional irrigation delivery system is required. This&#13;
would comprise of 850m of Branch Canal and 2050m of distributaries. The branch canal would&#13;
carry 5 cusecs. There would be fifteen canal sluices and twelve drop structures&#13;
74.   The average annual rainfall in the command area is 1165mm22. The area receives rain both&#13;
in the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons. The monthly distribution of rain is given in Table&#13;
5.2(v) together with other climatic data such as temperature, relative humidity, windspeed and&#13;
sunshine hours. Evapotranspiration values computed using modified Penman-Monteith method&#13;
prescribed by FAO are also given in the same table.&#13;
75.   The scheme command is covered by four agricultural extension centers each located at block&#13;
headquarters. Agricultural research work for the area is conducted by Ambasamuthram Agricultural&#13;
College and Research Center at Killikulam. Farm inputs supply and distribution are mainly handled&#13;
by the above centers. Fertilizers and pesticides are handled by seven cooperative shops and forty&#13;
private dealers. Typic Ustropepts, deep, moderately fine textured, calcareous soils and Udic&#13;
Rodustalfs, deep,medium textured, non-calcareous soils are found in the scheme command. These&#13;
soils are moderately suitable for paddy and upland crops under irrigated conditions.&#13;
76.   The existing cropping pattern in the tank irrigation area is paddy (Pishanum) in the northeast&#13;
monsoon season followed by rainfed pulses. Double cropping of paddy is practiced subject to&#13;
availability of tank water. A small area of coconut plantation also receives tank water. Areas with&#13;
access to supplementary well irrigation23 also have a similar paddy-based cropping pattern.&#13;
Groundnut and banana are also grown in a small area and, like other scheme commands in&#13;
Tirunelveli District, banana is grown in a three-year rotation with paddy. In the gap area, sorghum&#13;
is planted under rainfed conditions and some rainfed Pishanum paddy is grown as well. In the&#13;
dryland area which would be brought under the scheme command in the future, the main cropping&#13;
pattern in the pre-scheme situation is groundnut followed by pulses under rainfed conditions.&#13;
77.   With completion of proposed works, it is expected that the existing rainfed area would&#13;
become a more productive irrigated area and the existing irrigated command area would receive a&#13;
22 Based on rain measured at Shencottai rainfall station for the period 1971 to 1982.&#13;
23 It is estimated there are 578 wells in the scheme command capable of irrigating about 1.5 acres each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 20 of 23&#13;
more secure water supply. Double-cropping of paddy would be expanded to the extent possible&#13;
within the limit of the available water supply. The cultivation of existing non-paddy crops except&#13;
sorghum would continue under the scheme with an increase in their cropped area. Crop water&#13;
requirements have been computed based on the cropping pattern and crop calendar given in Figure&#13;
5.9. Water balance computations are in project file.&#13;
78.   The scheme would generate an incremental production of 21,670 tons of paddy, 547 tons of&#13;
pulses, 414 tons of groundnut, 121 tons of chilies, 2.3 million coconuts and 39,200 bunches of&#13;
bananas. Eight villages would benefit from the construction of the scheme It is estimated that 5400&#13;
small holders would benefit from this scheme. A beneficiary with a 1.5 acre farm would obtain an&#13;
incremental income of Rs9,159 per year whilst a family with a 2.5 acre farm with access to&#13;
supplementary well irrigation would obtain an incremental income of Rs 10,211 per year. In addition&#13;
additional agricultural employment opportunities would be created benefiting about 40,000 farm&#13;
workers. Average farm size in the scheme command varies from 0.25 ha to 2 ha. Overall cropping&#13;
intensities would increase from 152% to 228%.&#13;
79.   The estimated cost of the scheme is Rs851.93 million (US$27.48 million) including physical&#13;
and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(viii). It would take&#13;
seven years to complete the scheme with three divisions working on the scheme full time.&#13;
Implementation schedule is given in Figure 5. 1(viii). Full benefits would begin from year 2000.&#13;
The economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 12%.&#13;
80.   Water user associations will be formed for each benefitting tank and direct sluice command.&#13;
They will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank&#13;
and sluice outlets. An apex farmer organization comprising representatives from these associations&#13;
will be formally registered at the scheme level. The maintenance of the tanks including inlets and&#13;
outlets will be the joint responsibility of the WRO and the WUAs. The dam and canal system will&#13;
be maintained and operated by the WRO with inputs from the apex farmer organization.&#13;
Gridhammal II Scheme&#13;
81.   At present the tanks are filled with excess river flows through supply channels with open&#13;
offtakes at various points in the Gridhammal river. In each crop season people of the area build&#13;
temporary diversion structures24 made of clay, silt and sand. There are six offtakes and six supply&#13;
channels. Irunjirai, Athikulam, Maraiyur and Varisaiyur supply channels take off on the left side&#13;
feeding the four tanks of the same name and commanding a total area of 2042 acres. The Ulakkudi&#13;
and Manur supply channels take off from the right side of the river. Ulakudi supply channel feeds&#13;
Ulakkudi tank which commands 454 acres. The Manur channel feeds Manur, Athithanendal and&#13;
Narikudi tanks which command a total area of 602 acres. Under the scheme these open offtakes&#13;
would be replaced by one intake on the left bank and one on the right bank at the 1.4m high and&#13;
60m long diversion weir to be constructed under this project across the Gridhammal river. These&#13;
intakes would be capable of delivering the required flows to fill the respective tanks within a short&#13;
flood duration.&#13;
24 Locally called mud korambu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 21 of 23&#13;
82.   Irrigation water will be delivered to these two intakes via head sluices located on both banks.&#13;
Protection against siltation will be provided by scour sluices that would be located adjacent to the&#13;
head sluices. The left head sluice would have four vents each having 1.00m x 0.90m opening&#13;
capable of passing 5.6 cumecs in total. The right head sluice would have two vents having 1.10m&#13;
x 0.90m opening capable of passing 3 cumecs in total. The tanks would be filled in about one week&#13;
time. Vaigai-Gridhammal link channel is expected to operate for a period of about one week at the&#13;
rate of about 28 cumecs and therefore there would be sufficient water and time to fill the tanks.&#13;
The scour sluice on the left would have four vents with 1.65m x 1.70m opening and the scour sluice&#13;
on the right would have three vents with 1.1 Om x 1.70m opening with the upstream and downstream&#13;
aprons at the anicut apron level. The sill of the head sluices would be kept 0.30m above that of the&#13;
scour sluices.&#13;
83.   Improvements to the existing Irunjirai supply channel and also to the Athikulam supply&#13;
channel would be carried out by constructing a dividing dam across Irunjirai channel. The Irunjirai&#13;
channel would be modified to carry 5.8 cumecs at a full supply depth of 0.90m and a bed width of&#13;
10.00m. A dividing wall would be constructed in this channel just above the Nandkachi road&#13;
crossing. Below the dividing dam water would be let into Irunjirai and Athikulam supply channel&#13;
on a proportional basis. The requirements of Athikulam tank would be released through a V-notch&#13;
below the road culvert and the remaining flows for Maraiyur and Varisaiyur tanks would be&#13;
delivered via a 2700m long link channel. In the Irunjirai channel one 700mm drop at LS Om, a&#13;
masonry core wall from LS Om to 60m, footpath at LS 270m, inlets at LS 30m, 240m,and 330m&#13;
would be constructed.&#13;
84.   A 2700m long link channel will be excavated to connect Athikulam supply channel to&#13;
Maraiyur channel offtake point. This channel would carry 2.2 cumecs. Following structures would&#13;
be built on this channel: Main Road Culvert at LS 870m, Culvert at LS 1785m, foot bridge at LS&#13;
240m, 600mm drop at LS 300m, 720m, and 1500m, lOOOmm drop at LS 1950m, and 2640m,&#13;
1200mm drop at LS 2880m, Superpassage cum culvert at LS 2430m and 3300m, superpassage at&#13;
LS 2100m.&#13;
85.   A 2400m long link channel will be excavated to connect Maraiyur supply channel to&#13;
Varisaiyur supply channel. The existing Maraiyur supply channel would be used as a common&#13;
carrier for both Maraiyur and Varisaiyur tanks upto LS 1700m. At this point a dividing dam would&#13;
be built and the left side channel would carry flows to the Maraiyur tank. The right side channel&#13;
would be the link canal which would go beyond the surplus weir of Maraiyur channel upto the&#13;
beginning point of Varisaiyur channel. The link channel will have a carrying capacity of 1.1&#13;
cumecs. There would be one 1000mm drop and an outlet structure on this channel.The Maraiyur&#13;
channel would be improved to handle additional flows. Five check dams would be provided to&#13;
control flow velocities.&#13;
86.   A 2000m long link channel will be excavated from right side head sluice on the diversion&#13;
weir to connect to Ulakudi supply channel upto its present offtake. The link channel dimensions&#13;
would be 6.00m x 0.90m. The link would have the following structures: foot bridge at LS 180m,&#13;
1000mm drop at LS 300m, super passages at LS 330m, 1150m and 1435m, road culvert at LS505m,&#13;
cart track culvert cum super passage at LS 685m, core wall from LS 970m to 1020m, super passage&#13;
cum culvert at LS 995m, 500mm drops at LS 1125m and 1780m, grade wall at LS340m (5m&#13;

long),excess flow outlet from LS 320m to 350m, dividing dam at LS 560m, retaining wall from LS&#13;
560m to 590m and main road culvert across Narikudi-Manamadurai road.&#13;
87.   A 2500m long link channel will be excavated from dividing dam across Ulakkudi channel&#13;
to Manur offtake point. The link canal would carry 1.6 cumecs and have section dimensions of&#13;
6.00m x 0.60m. Retaining walls would be constructed at appropriate places. 1000mm drop at LS&#13;
750m and a super passage at LS 11 1inm would be provided.&#13;
88.   Since the Manur supply channel has to carry the combined supplies to three tanks, the&#13;
section would be modified to carry 1.6 cumecs. Necessary provisions would be made for cart track&#13;
crossing, field drain crossing etc.&#13;
89.   Necessary improvements to benefitting tanks such as repair of tank embankments, inlets,&#13;
outlets etc., would be carried out.&#13;
90.   The scheme command is covered by one agricultural extension center located at block&#13;
headquarters. Farm inputs supply and distribution are mainly handled by the extension center. A&#13;
number of village cooperative societies and private dealers also handle chemical fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides in the area.Typic Chromusterts and Typic Haplustalfs which are deep, rroderately coarse&#13;
to fine textured soils suitable for paddy-based cropping under irrigated conditions are found in the&#13;
scheme command.&#13;
91.   The present cropping pattern in the tank irrigation area is single cropping of paddy (Samba)&#13;
in the northeast monsoon season. In a limited area with supplementary well irrigation facility25,&#13;
paddy (Samba) followed by cotton is the main cropping pattern. In addition, sugarcane is cultivated&#13;
in a small area on a three-year rotation with paddy. In the gap area rainfed sorghum is cultivated.&#13;
92.   With completion of proposed works, it is expected that the existing tank irrigation area would&#13;
receive a more secure water supply and the gap area would become a more productive irrigated area.&#13;
Paddy (Samba) would remain the dominant crop with pulses grown on residual moisture after&#13;
harvest of Samba Paddy. Some increase in sugarcane area is also anticipated. Crop water&#13;
requirements have been computed on the basis of the crop calendar and cropping pattern given in&#13;
Figure 5.10. Water balance computations are on file.&#13;
93.   The scheme is expected to generate an incremental production of 2,673 tons of paddy, 4,995&#13;
tons of sugarcane, 856 tons of pulses and 16 tons of cotton. A beneficiary with 1.5 acre farm would&#13;
obtain an incremental income of Rs2056 per year whilst a beneficiary with 2.5 acres and having&#13;
access to supplementary well irrigation facility would obtain an incremental income of Rs10,293 per&#13;
annum. Overall cropping intensities would increase from 103% to 194%.&#13;
94.   The estimated cost to complete this scheme is Rs53.14 million (US$1.71 million) including&#13;
physical and price contingencies. Detailed quantities and costs are given in Table 5.3(ix). The&#13;
25 There are an estimated 110 wells in the scheme command area capable of irrigating about 2.5 acres each.&#13;

scheme can be completed in one year by one division. The agricultural benefits would start to&#13;
accrue from 1995 onwards. The economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 62%.&#13;
95.   Water user associations will be formed at each of the eight benefitting tanks. They will be&#13;
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system below the tank outlets. An&#13;
apex farmer organization comprising representatives from these associations will be formally&#13;
registered at the scheme level. The maintenance of the tanks including inlets and outlets will be the&#13;
joint responsibility of the WRO and the WUAs. The diversion weir and canal system will be&#13;
maintained and operated by the WRO with inputs from the apex farmer organization.&#13;
Appendix 1. Background information on traditional irrigation infrastructure&#13;
96.   Irrigated agriculture has been practiced in Tamil Nadu for more than a thousand years.&#13;
Rainfall is influenced mainly by the northeast monsoon in the cultivable areas. This monsoon rain&#13;
is concentrated in the months of October, November and December. The remaining period of the&#13;
year is usually dry. Even the monsoon rain can be erratic both in its onset and end and in quantity&#13;
as well. The ancient kings who ruled parts of Tamil Nadu had devised a system of small to medium&#13;
sized storage reservoirs referred to as tanks to collect the rainwater and to use it for irrigation.&#13;
These tanks originally were constructed to receive the flows generated in their own catchments.&#13;
With the progress of time, the yield of the tank catchments were supplemented by water diverted&#13;
from nearby streams and rivers. The recipient tanks are referred to as system tanks and the other&#13;
type being commonly called rainfed tanks. The diversion is achieved by masonry structures called&#13;
anicuts built across the streams a few centuries ago. Some areas are irrigated through sluices&#13;
provided in the supply channels taking water from the diversion weirs to the tanks. These areas are&#13;
called direct ayacuts and the commands under system tanks are called the indirect ayacuts. In&#13;
recent years, some more tanks are receiving supplementary water through temporary diversion&#13;
structures built each year by the farmers referred to as mud korambu. Below these tanks, a fully&#13;
developed traditional irrigation system is in place. However, yields from the catchment of the tanks&#13;
have reduced particularly over the last two decades due to changes in land use and abstractions&#13;
within the catchment. The supply channels and the open offtakes at the anicuts are limited by&#13;
design and are therefore unable to extract additional flows from the rivers. Hence the cultivated&#13;
areas are no longer assured of a secure irrigation supply. Most of the area gets partial supply and&#13;
upto 25% of the commands on the average does not get any water at all and it is either left as&#13;
fallow or cultivated under rainfed conditions with poor yields. Some farmers have constructed&#13;
shallow wells to supplement the tank water. Yields of crops in such areas are higher than in regular&#13;
tank-fed areas reflecting the effect of moisture stress.&#13;

WATER POLICY FOR TAMILNADU&#13;
I. PREAMBLE&#13;
The National Water Policy enunciated by the Government&#13;
of India in 1987 has recognised that water is a prime&#13;
natural resource, a basic human need, and a precious&#13;
national asset. Water as a resource is one and is&#13;
encompassed in the hydrological cycle; river water, surface&#13;
storage, and ground water are all part of one system; water&#13;
is also part of the larger ecological system. Water is one&#13;
of the most crucial elements in developmental planning. As&#13;
the State prepares itself to enter the 21st century, it must&#13;
develop, conserve, utilise, and manage this important&#13;
resource on an integrated and environmentally sound basis to&#13;
meet the growing needs.&#13;
With a high percentage of the State's surface water&#13;
resources already utilised, the scope for constructing new&#13;
surface water storage reservoirs is limited. More efficient&#13;
water management is the most needed measure to ensure&#13;
additional productivity from water in Tamilnadu.&#13;
Opportunities for conservation and reuse in irrigation,&#13;
industry and municipal water systems together with sector&#13;
policies developed to promote conjunctive use of surface and&#13;
groundwater and effective conservation measures in all water&#13;
use sectors need to be pursued.&#13;
Water quality of surface and ground water sources must&#13;
be maintained to established standards in order to protect&#13;
designated users from deterioration of the resource. Water&#13;
legislation and regulations, the design of facilities, and&#13;
the management of basin water resources shall be directed to&#13;
maintain water quality appropriate for designated uses and&#13;
to permit maximum reuse of all water following each&#13;
diversion. The government through the appropriate agencies&#13;
shall provide' means and measures to manage all aspects of&#13;
water development beneficially, including timely control of&#13;
groundwater levels, restriction or treatment of wastes;&#13;
maintenance of appropr:ate water 2uality as designated for&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Sectoral.  Environmental  Assessment  S rya/&#13;
introduction&#13;
1.    The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP) will&#13;
introduce a more rational and sustainable system of water use and management&#13;
in the State of Tamil Nadu. In preparation for the project, a Sectoral&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) has been carried out in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank's Guidelines. The result of this work was a comprehensive report&#13;
covering the environmental issues of the water resource sector for the whole&#13;
state, examination of the impacts of the investment components under the&#13;
project, and preparation of an Environmental Management Action Plan which has&#13;
been incorporated in the WRCP project proposal. The Environmental Assessment&#13;
was carried out by HR Wallingford Consultants of UK in association with&#13;
environmental consultants from Indial, the Public Works Department and other&#13;
relevant state and national bodies. Social impact analysis and preparation of&#13;
an economic rehabilitation programme for families affected by land acquisition&#13;
under the project has also been carried out with assistance of Operations&#13;
Research Group consultants and is described in Part II of this sunmmary.&#13;
Assistance and guidance provided by World Bank officials and officials of the&#13;
Ministry of Environment is gratefully acknowledged.&#13;
PART 1. - ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT AND ACTIONS&#13;
2.    The focus of the EA has been the overall environmental isaues facing the&#13;
water resources sector in Tamil Nadu. This included a review of the existing&#13;
legal and institutional framework as well as study of the physical&#13;
environmental issues in the state as a whole and the specific environmental&#13;
impacts of the project's investment components. An Environmental Action Plan&#13;
(EAP) has been prepared and proposals made for inatitutional changes to ensure&#13;
that the present technical requirements, organization and environmental skills&#13;
are improved so that they are better able to deal with environmental issues in&#13;
the future. This Executive Summary presents the main points arising from the&#13;
environmental assessment and social impact studies.&#13;
Project Objectivea and Description&#13;

(c) Water Planning, Environmental Management and Research (Rs. 1100 million&#13;
or USS 35 million; 12% of base costs); and&#13;
(d) Institutional Strengthening (Rs 684 million or USS 22 million; 8% of base&#13;
costs).&#13;
4.    The Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover programme responds to the&#13;
state's need to improve water management on existing commands which are old&#13;
and in poor repair. As a result water distribution is poor resulting in&#13;
unreliable water, shortfalls in tail reaches and waterlogging at headends. It&#13;
would involve rehabilitation and modernization on about 650,000 ha comprising&#13;
about 50% of the state's surface irrigated area. The programme would be&#13;
conducted on 17 major and medium irrigation commands and 40 minor commands.&#13;
Works are confined to the existing irrigation distribution network comprising&#13;
repair and as needed additional water control structures, and repair and&#13;
selective lining of canals, plus measuring devices and a radio communications&#13;
network. Farmers would also be provided topographic assistance in their&#13;
construction of water channels for irrigating their fields. The programme is&#13;
technically similar to the successful National Water Management Project&#13;
(Credit 1770-IN) already implemented in Tamil Nadu on 150,000 ha, but involves&#13;
a two-stage investment approach and integration of farmers in investment&#13;
decisions and part of investment cost, and arrangements with Farmer Councils&#13;
for take-over by farmers of operations and maintenance of distributaries plus&#13;
association of farmers in overall scheme management. Maintenance would also&#13;
be strengthened: government funding has been increased to full levels&#13;
required, and will be continued to the required levels for sustainability of&#13;
the infrastructure.&#13;
5.    Scheme Completions involve completion works on nine existing commands to&#13;
improve availability and reliability of irrigation supplies. The works&#13;
typically involve improvement and completion of the existing irrigation and&#13;
drainage system, including additional canals and bypass channels as needed,&#13;
and supplemental storage through small reservoirs (eight reservoirs in total&#13;
with an average area of 67 ha). Total land acquisition needs amount to about&#13;
600 ha, and the associated land acquisition and economic rehabilitation&#13;
programme is described in Part II. All schemes have been subject to&#13;
individual environmental assessment and appropriate environmental safeguards&#13;
incorporated, and environmental clearance by state and central government&#13;
authorities has been obtained for each sub-project.&#13;
6.    Other project components do not involve physical works, and comprise&#13;
strengthening of water planning and environmental capabilities and associated&#13;
policy reforms, consistent with the recently formulated "Tamil Nadu State&#13;
Water Policy', and Government's objectives to manage the state's water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

resources holistically; catering to both the needs of different sectors and&#13;
safeguarding the environmental sustainability of water resources.  To&#13;
implement these objectives under the project, a Water Resources Organisation&#13;
(WRO) has been created from the former irrigation wing of the Public Works&#13;
Department. WRO will be strengthened under the project to emphasise a broader&#13;
management role for state water resources and improved capability in all&#13;
technical areas; from water planning to water management. A Water Resources&#13;
Control and Review Council (WRCRC), comprising all parties involved with water&#13;
use and environmental management has also been created, and state water&#13;
planning and allocation will be implemented under the WRCRC and its technical&#13;
Secretariat, the Institute of Water Studies. Priorities for public&#13;
expenditure have also been overhauled, with emphasis now on maintenance and&#13;
water management rather than new construction.&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
7.    The project area includes commands distributed throughout the State of&#13;
Tamil Nadu, and basin planning has state-wide coverage. The EA was based on a&#13;
thorough review of the water related environmental conditions prevailing&#13;
throughout the State. Conditions in the major river basins were examined and&#13;
a detailed assessment was made of the Bhavani river basin to provide a model&#13;
for future studies to be carried out by IWS. Comprehensive data was collected&#13;
from numerous Government and non-Government sources and extensive&#13;
consultations were held with NGOs and individuals covering all aspects of the&#13;
water related environment.&#13;
8.    Tamil Nadu with a population of 55.6 million has 7% of India's total&#13;
population; but only 4% of its land area and only 3% of its water resources,&#13;
and is thus water short relative to other states. The state's average&#13;
rainfall is 925 rn/annum, but is highly variable, both yearwise and&#13;
geographically. Tamil Nadu is affected by two monsoons, the northeast monsoon&#13;
(October to December, average 440 mm/annum) and the southwest monsoon (June to&#13;
September, 310 mm). Rainfall is highest on the coast, decreasing westwards as&#13;
the impact of the northeast monsoon diminishes. Water resources are estimated&#13;
to be 23.6 billion cubic meters of surface water and 22.3 billion cubic meters&#13;
of groundwater. The construction of tanks and reservoirs over the last 100&#13;
years has harnessed the surface water to a large extent and there is little&#13;
opportunity for further development of this nature.&#13;
9.    The soils are generally fertile and lack of suitable soils is not a&#13;
constraint to agriculture which is the principal activity in the State.&#13;
Irrigated agriculture is a key activity in the local economy, covering 2.4&#13;
million ha under canal, tank and well irrigation or 41% of the state's net&#13;
cropped area. Rlice is the main crop grown in irrigated areas, with increasing&#13;
development of groundnut, banana, sugarcane, cotton, coconut, vegetables and&#13;
other cash crops. Farm holdings are typically small, with about three-&#13;
quarters of land holdings less than 1 ha.&#13;
10.   The state comprises 17 river basins, all flowing eastwards from the&#13;
Western Ghats and the Deccan plateau. Amongst these, the major rivers are the&#13;
Cauvery, Palar, Vellar, Vaigai, Bhavani and Tambaraparani. Tamil Nadu either&#13;
contains a basin in full or is a downstream riparian. For one river, the&#13;
Cauvery, shared with upstream Karnataka, water sharing has not been agreed and&#13;
Tamil Nadu has decided to undertake no investment in disputed parts of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 17&#13;
basin. While basin planning in the Cauvery would be part of the project, the&#13;
WRCP contains no plans for investment in disputed parts of the Cauvery basin.&#13;
Tamil Nadu does not contain any internationally shared rivers.&#13;
11.   Approximately 95% of the surface water resources are utilized and 90% of&#13;
this for irrigated agriculture. The demand for potable water supply and water&#13;
for industry is increasing and is expected to expand significantly in the&#13;
future in line with urban and industrial growth. Gross usage will remain&#13;
dominated by agriculture, but near urban centers, municipal and industrial&#13;
needs will become important to the basins concerned. Basin planning and&#13;
allocation on a cross-sectoral basis is needed, including reallocation as&#13;
necessary to serve the state's changing needs and growing imbalances.&#13;
12.   Madras city's specific water needs are acute.  Serious water shortage&#13;
and rising population and industrialisation have necessitated severe water&#13;
rationing and recourse to bringing water in by train and lorry to supplement&#13;
meager supplies. Low pressure in pipes also results in contamination posing&#13;
health risks beyond those posed by shortage of water for washing and other&#13;
hygienic purposes, especially for poorer families. The state has two projects&#13;
under preparation for possible World Bank financing: the Veeranam Water Supply&#13;
project would bring water from Veeranam tank to Madras, and a subsequent&#13;
project would provide water supply and sanitation services to Madras using the&#13;
Krishna Water Supply Project as a source.&#13;
13.   Groundwater pumping has progressively increased and it is now estimated&#13;
that 60% of groundwater resources are utilized, mostly for irrigated&#13;
agriculture, but with significant withdrawals for urban use near major&#13;
centers. Groundwater utilization varies by basin. In a number of locations,&#13;
especially around Madras, Coimbatore and Madurai and parts of the Palar and&#13;
vaigai basins, withdrawals are causing groundwater levels to fall. In&#13;
affected coastal areas, saline intrusion is also occurring.&#13;
14.   The State has a wide variety of flora and fauna, mainly in the hilly&#13;
regions in the western ghats, and the forest areas are rich in plant and&#13;
animal life. The State has a long coastline and marine fisheries are an&#13;
important source of income. Most of the coastline is developed but there are&#13;
small areas of mangrove and a wildlife sanctuary at Point Calimere covering&#13;
1,700 ha of tidal swamps.&#13;
15.   Only 1% of Tamil Nadu's population belongs to scheduled tribes, and the&#13;
main concentrations of tribal groupa are in the hill country and will not be&#13;
affected by the project.&#13;
16.   The WRCP is not an isolated project but builds on experience under&#13;
previous interventions in the water sector, including assistance from World&#13;
Bank and other donors. In particular, the project's main component follows&#13;
closely on the experience and succeases gained from the National Water&#13;
Management Project (NWMP) funded by the World Bank.&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
17.   The environmental assessment provides an overview of the water resources&#13;
sector of the State and covers issues both within and beyond the scope of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 17&#13;
WRCP. The findings of the environmental assessment have been taken into&#13;
account during project preparation through integration of environmental&#13;
considerations into the project design. Below is a summary of actual or&#13;
potential environmental issues that have been reviewed by the environmental.&#13;
assessment, with recommendations as appropriate on actions to be taken.&#13;
Environmental Tmpact of Project Investments&#13;
18.   The impact of the WRCP's investment components have been examined at&#13;
design stage on a scheme-by-scheme basis and with reference to the&#13;
environmental status of the existing schemes and experience with previous&#13;
similar investments. The Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover progranune is&#13;
found to be environmentally beneficial, in line with the positive experience&#13;
already gained under the National Water Management Project, where 150,000 ha&#13;
have been improved in Tamil Nadu. The rehabilitation and modernisation to&#13;
improve water management directly tackles current widespread problems of poor&#13;
water distribution. By improving water distribution, problems of excess water&#13;
in headreaches, leading to water logging and rising groundwater and potential&#13;
salinisation, would be tackled, as would the reverse problem of insufficient&#13;
or no water in tail reaches, reducing productivity and potentially causing&#13;
groundwater levels to fall, as well as reducing pressure to pump groundwater&#13;
by farmers. The project would thus have positive impact on the state's&#13;
groundwater situation. Schemes have been subject to careful hydrological&#13;
analysis, and the investments, entailing repair and improvements on the&#13;
existing distribution systems, would not cause environmental disruptions.&#13;
Sustainability of the systems, would be ensured through improved maintenance&#13;
and involvement of farmers in water management and maintenance.&#13;
19.   The Scheme Completions have each been subject to detailed environmental&#13;
analysis from the perspectives of hydrological impact, impact on flora and&#13;
fauna, forest impact, soil erosion, siltation, safety of dams and construction&#13;
practices, and found environmentally acceptable by state and central&#13;
government and the consultants. Completion of small reservoirs averaging 67&#13;
ha in size are involved in eight of the nine scheme completions. Loss of&#13;
forest land totalling 107 ha for the nine schemes combined is considered&#13;
acceptable, particularly as this impact would be greatly outweighed by the&#13;
catchment management programme to be funded under the project.  A positive&#13;
environmental impact is that the scheme completions, through the additional&#13;
storage and link canals, enable resolving present inadequacies in water&#13;
management in the commands concerned. The main environmental impact resulting&#13;
from the reservoirs and additional distribution canals is due to the need for&#13;
land acquisition (600 ha in total). Full land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation provisions have been made, as discussed in Part II.&#13;
Other Water seetor Related Tmsues&#13;
Summarised below are other environmental issues reviewed in the environmental&#13;
assessment with comments where appropriate on impact or actions included under&#13;
the WRCP.&#13;
20.   Need for Water Planning.  With surface water almost entirely utilized&#13;
and groundwater exploitation increasing, improved water resources management&#13;
is critical to the future social and economic development of the State. This&#13;
is the most important need in an environmental action plan for Tamil Nadu13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 6 of 17&#13;
water resources, as basin planning is central to all initiatives. A more&#13;
holistic approach is needed than hitherto in resolving water resource and&#13;
related environmental issues. Sectoral environmental issues need to be taken&#13;
into account in the preparation of river basin plans for future development.&#13;
As little potential exists for the development of new sources of supply other&#13;
than interstate water transfer and desalination, water resources will have to&#13;
be well managed and conserved if future demands are to be met. Planning and&#13;
allocation, including reallocation as needed, will in particular need to find&#13;
solutions to the growing needs of industry and domestic use, and improved&#13;
efficiency of use in agriculture. The WRCP's water planning initiatives,&#13;
already underway, would provide an important start to improved water resources&#13;
management for the state.&#13;
21.   Tmnroving Rnvironmnttal CrapAhlity in WRO. Environmental capability is&#13;
assessed to need strengthening in WRO. The institution needs capability to&#13;
handle environmental matters in all relevant aspects of its work. The EA&#13;
recommended creation of environmental units in IWS (WRO's state water planning&#13;
agency) and with Chief Engineer, Project Formulation, plus environmental cells&#13;
at the levels of the basin managers, and an environmental sub-committee in the&#13;
Water Resources Control and Review Council, together with supporting actions&#13;
to strengthen surface and groundwater hydrological measurement, laboratories&#13;
for water quality testing, supporting research actions and provision of&#13;
consultancies, training and equipment to improve technical capability, all&#13;
included under the EAP.&#13;
22.   Watpr Mana    n.  The important need for improving surface water&#13;
deliveries and drainage within existing conuands (improving productivity and&#13;
efficiency of water use, reducing pressures on rainfed land as a result of&#13;
increased output and employment in irrigated areas and increased biomass for&#13;
cattle fodder and fuel, reducing pressures for groundwater pumpir,g as a result&#13;
of reliable and equitable water supplies, correcting waterlogging/salinisation&#13;
in headreaches and inadequately drained areas) would be specifically addressed&#13;
under the project's investment programme.&#13;
23.  crri   dwatpr Prnte±i2n.  Better management of groundwater exploitation&#13;
is needed, and will become increasingly important over time. Whilst not&#13;
c. .Lcal over the State as a whole, there are increasing areas of over-&#13;
e -Atation. The project's investment components are not supporting&#13;
g. .;dwater development and would reduce pressures on groundwater and&#13;
ele..tricity use for pumping, as a result of more reliable and equitable&#13;
surface supplies. More broadly, however, actions were recommended for overall&#13;
groundwater sector management and included: groundwater monitoring to be&#13;
strengthened through additional measurement facilities and strengthened data&#13;
collection, processing and analysis; establishment of a groundwater regulatory&#13;
mechanism and supporting legislation to limit licenses and usage in areas of&#13;
overexploitation; and price incentives to discourage overpumping.&#13;
24.   CatehmAnt orotection.  To date, land and water management of catchments&#13;
has been on a piece-meal project by project basis which has not sufficiently&#13;
taken into account complex inter-relationships within the catchment.&#13;
Vegetative cover ranges from excellent to poor, as for instance, in parts of&#13;
the Bhavani basin where soil conservation and forestation measures are needed.&#13;
The formation of the River Basin Managers under the WRCP will lead to better&#13;
catchment management and coordination at the basin level between the numerous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 7 of 17&#13;
agencies involved in catchment activities. Basin plans will be drawn up which&#13;
will identify degraded catchments and propose suitable conservation measures&#13;
and address problems such as eutrophication. Funding of catchment management&#13;
actions in critical areas would be provided under the EAP through WRO&#13;
provisions to the relevant agencies after detailed plans have been prepared&#13;
and reviewed by the WRCRC'3 environmental committee and basin managers.&#13;
25.   Water Oual;ty  Water quality is becoming a serious issue in some areas.&#13;
For example, in the Palar basin industrial pollution of ground and surface&#13;
water by the tanneries needs to be regulated, effluent problems are associated&#13;
with most urban centers, and salinisation of groundwater needs monitoring and&#13;
remedial actions where appropriate. The EAP would assist in improved water&#13;
quality management through the various technical and institutional&#13;
strengthening activities: (i) the establishment of the WRCRC as the top level&#13;
body to identify problems, prepare strategies and coordinate actions with&#13;
other agencies, and the basin managers at local levels; (ii) improved&#13;
monitoring, data collection and the establishment of a central data system;&#13;
(iii) groundwater actions as discussed above; and (iv) special studies under&#13;
the research programme in problem areas.&#13;
26.   wjldlifp.  The State has abundant wildlife but not within the command&#13;
areas included in the project and there is, therefore, little possibility of&#13;
harming or enhancing it. Within the project areas the tanks are the most&#13;
beneficial habitats for wildlife, especially bird life. Those tanks which are&#13;
identified by the Wildlife Department as having significant bird populations&#13;
are designated sanctuaries and under the guidance of the Forestry Department.&#13;
WRO retains the right to control the water but enables the trees and birds to&#13;
be protected. The project investments will not have any adverse affect on&#13;
this arrangement.&#13;
27.           _        .mmunity  with rehabilitation, improved maintenance and better&#13;
water management, the WRCP is expected to have a beneficial impact on&#13;
community health by improving nutrition as a result of the greater food&#13;
production and wealth created, and by reducing the incidence of some water-&#13;
related diseases through reduction of areas of stagnant water. The&#13;
recommendation to include health officials in the WRCRC and review of basin&#13;
plans and future sub-project environmental assessment is included in the EAP.&#13;
28.    naUrgJyLe.  The WRCP is not financing groundwater development.  Impact&#13;
of the project on energy use by rural pumpsets is assessed to be towards less&#13;
consumption of energy for this purpose. This would result from the impact of&#13;
the project's systems improvement program which would improve the reliability&#13;
and equity of water distribution on half of the state's surface irrigated&#13;
area. Farmers with pumpsets in irrigated areas would have less need for&#13;
groundwater pumping, and energy use is expected to be reduced based on field&#13;
observations in already improved comnands.  Quantitative assessment of the&#13;
magnitude of this impact is, however, not available, and is a recommended&#13;
topic for research under the project's Water Resources Research Fund.&#13;
29.   Other  nrvi ronmental TsueR.  A number of other environmental issues were&#13;
examined under the EA. River  8Mohnlngy anet F1ndet{i.g was found not to be&#13;
affected by WRCP investments. WRO intends under the project to prepare E19d&#13;
control and nrotight Ma    ment Antinn PlAns under the project's water planning&#13;
programme. S±ltati.n would be reduced as a result of the catchment management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 8 of 17&#13;
programme, and, as needed, sediment control structures at headworks, and the&#13;
stepped-up maintenance activities under the project for canal desilting.&#13;
Presence of Aquatic Weedg will be reduced under improved maintenance and&#13;
scheduling of supplies so that water is 'on" or "off'. Finally, a variety of&#13;
environmental reaearch topics were identified for the project's research&#13;
programme and have been included in the EAP&#13;
Environmental Action Plan&#13;
30.   An Environmental Action Plan has been prepared and is designed to ensure&#13;
that environmental considerations form an integral part of the duties of the&#13;
new WRO and that all opportunities for environmental enhancement are carried&#13;
beyond the planning stage into implementation. The EAP comprises the&#13;
following components, which have also been summarised in the attached matrix:&#13;
(a) State Water Policy. Environmental management features have been&#13;
incorporated in a Tamil Nadu State Water Policy prepared in 1993/94 and&#13;
approved by Government of Tamil Nadu in July 1994.  This has been prepared&#13;
consistent with the National Water Policy (Government of India, 1987) and with&#13;
the overall objectives of the Water Resources Management policy paper issued&#13;
by the World Bank in 1993. Tamil Nadu's water policy highlights the water&#13;
scarcity faced by Tamil Nadu and the need for management as a unitary&#13;
resource; by river basin, conjunctively for surface and groundwater,&#13;
integrating environmental management, planning holistically for all uses of&#13;
water, prioritizing water between sectors including drinking water and the&#13;
growing needs for industrial and urban requirements, and improving the&#13;
efficiency of water use in the agricultural sector, the largest user of water.&#13;
Specific actions discussed in the policy backstop actions relevant to WRO's&#13;
responsibilities included under the WRCP and environmental action plan.&#13;
(b)  Tnstitutional Needs. The reorganisation of WRO includes establishment of&#13;
a water planning and allocation apparatus and work schedule to plan water by&#13;
river basin and on a holistic basis. A Water Resources Control and Review&#13;
Council was created in September 1993 as the highest state body for water&#13;
planning and allocation decisions. The WRCRC is chaired by the Chief Minister&#13;
and comprises membership of all Departments connected with water use, supply&#13;
and related environmental issues. WRO's Institute of Water Studies has been&#13;
appointed Secretariat of the WRCRC and Nodal Agency for state and basin&#13;
planning. Under a revised work schedule for IWS, commenced in 1993 in&#13;
preparation for the WRCP, initial basin assessments have been carried out on&#13;
16 of Tamil Nadu's 17 river basins, and the remaining basin and a State&#13;
Framework Water Plan will be completed by December 1994. More in-depth Basin&#13;
Plans and a detailed State Water Plan will be prepared in the following three&#13;
years, and subsequently updated on a periodic basis.&#13;
Under the EAP an Environmental Committee will be established within the&#13;
WRCRC to provide specific high-level attention and expertise to environmental&#13;
matters in water planning. An Environmental unit has been established in IWS&#13;
to provide staff capability for water planning within IWS, and an&#13;
environmental unit also established with WRO's C.E. Project Formulation, which&#13;
will have responsibility for carrying out environmental impact assessments for&#13;
all future investment proposals and will ensure that all new works conform to&#13;
the statutory regulations, both Central and State Government, before work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 9 of 17&#13;
commences. WRO's Basin Managers will also have environmental cells&#13;
responsible for the functional aspects of environmental activities at field&#13;
level. The RMB cells will monitor environmental issues at the basin level and&#13;
coordinate with local government and non-government organizations and&#13;
individuals ao that environmental concerns are fully addressed by WRO. Work&#13;
will include monitoring of water quality and point pollution episodes, and&#13;
contributions to the environmental aspects of the river basin plans.&#13;
(c)   Measurement and Monitoring Capability. Capability to measure and monitor&#13;
all aspects of surface and groundwater hydrology including environmental&#13;
aspects such as water quality (salinity, organic and inorganic pollutants) and&#13;
groundwater situation will be strengthened under WRO's new Water Resources&#13;
Data Center including expanded facilities for field measurement, laboratory&#13;
equipment, and computers and other equipment for data storage, retrieval and&#13;
dissemination (to be funded under the National Hydrology Project). Under the&#13;
WRCP, WRO's Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology and Irrigation Management&#13;
and Training Institute will also be strengthened, including in aspects related&#13;
to environmental management.&#13;
(d)   rrondwatpr Manag-ement.  The following actions would be taken within&#13;
WRO's area of responsibility. Groundwater legislation would be prepared to&#13;
establish a framework for regulating new development, development restrictions&#13;
in areas where groundwater resources are threatened, licensing and setting&#13;
limits on withdrawals. A Groundwater Regulatory Directorate would be&#13;
established in WRO responsible for implementing groundwater regulatory&#13;
actions. These measures would establish the needed regulatory apparatus in&#13;
WRO to improve management of groundwater development and exploitation.&#13;
(e) Catchmant Management. The EAP includes a funding provision of Rs 60&#13;
million (US$ 2 million) for ecorestoration of impoverished catchments with&#13;
high soil erosion and siltation problems. Intensive investigation and&#13;
implementation plans would be developed in the first two years of the project&#13;
followed by channelling of funds by WRO to the concerned agencies (forest&#13;
department, agricultural engineering, agriculture, environment, etc).&#13;
(f)   Procaedures and Guidelines.  WRO will prepare procedures and guidelines&#13;
for environmental assessment and will check that environmental issues are&#13;
properly addressed at the design and implementation stages of any works&#13;
undertaken, to ensure GOI and GOTN statutory requirements are met. A code of&#13;
good construction practice will be prepared and included as part of future&#13;
construction contracts.&#13;
(g) Consultancy Services and Training. This will form an important part of&#13;
the EAP as most staff will be engineers redeployed from other tasks and will&#13;
thus initially have a limited knowledge of environmental problems.&#13;
Consultancy services will be used to assist the WRO and provide on-the-job&#13;
training, for carrying out any EIA that may be needed and for advice on the&#13;
preparation of procedures, guidelines and codes. A consultant will be&#13;
appointed as Expert Advisor (part time) to the WRO for the first three years&#13;
until the IWS can fulfil this function. Staff training and recruitment for&#13;
c6re positions has commenced. Training will include specialist training for&#13;
WRO's environmental staff, and awareness training for different staff levels&#13;
and functions for other staff. Seminars and workshops involving other&#13;
Government departments and members of the public will also be arranged to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 10 of 17&#13;
encourage general awareness in the state on water related environmental&#13;
issues.&#13;
(h)   Applied Research Program.  Research topics have been identified as&#13;
necessary to better understand and solve some of the sectoral problems&#13;
mentioned above. Research would cover groundwater recharge studies, pollution&#13;
assessments, wastewater reuse, catchment processes and interlinkages,&#13;
sedimentation, health hazards and other topics as appropriate. The research&#13;
will be managed by IWS and will be on a collaborative basis with involvement&#13;
of other units within WRO such as IHH, and local universities. Modest funds&#13;
have also been set aside for a twinning arrangement with an overseas institute&#13;
which would contribute technical expertise to the research program, contribute&#13;
to training and provide specialist short term consultancy inputs as required.&#13;
31.   Equipment, consultancy, training, laboratories, the ecorestoration&#13;
program and other expenses related to the above activities have been detailed&#13;
and included under the WRCP proposal, amounting in total to Rs 270 million&#13;
(USS 8.7 million).&#13;
Overall Assessment&#13;
32.   The WRCP will introduce substantial institutional changes with the&#13;
creation of a new Water Resources Control and Review Council and Water&#13;
Resources Organisation. Under this new institutional structure the focus of&#13;
activity will shift from development of new works to water resources&#13;
management. Environmental awareness and capability will be integrated into&#13;
mainstream activities through the Environmental Action Plan included under the&#13;
project. The physical works included in the project are low impact activities&#13;
which are substantially confined to the improvement of existing irrigated&#13;
command areas and will lead to more efficient and sustainable water use. The&#13;
project's limited land acquisition and economic rehabilitation needs will be&#13;
handled comprehensively, including creation of institutional capability and&#13;
comprehensive economic rehabilitation based on detailed socio-economic surveys&#13;
and action plans (refer Part II).&#13;
33.   The project is in line with the principles set forth at the Dublin&#13;
Conference on Water and the Environment for improved management of water&#13;
resources. No significant negative impacts have been identified resulting&#13;
from the project, and, if implemented according to design, the project will&#13;
lead to environmental enhancement. The Environmental Action Plan and Land&#13;
Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation program form an integral part of the&#13;
project and are aimed at ensuring this enhancement.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJZECT&#13;
SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY&#13;
PART I:. - SOCIAL ISSUES&#13;
1.    The WRCP integrates in project design the objective expressed in the&#13;
Tamil Nadu State Water Policy (1994) that sustainable planning, construction,&#13;
management and maintenance of water infrastructure must involve the public and&#13;
in particular the users. By so doing, results more responsive to needs can be&#13;
obtained, the energies and talents of the non-government sector can be better&#13;
utilized, and a sense of 'ownership" develops, leading to creative use of&#13;
decision forums and better care of infrastructure.&#13;
2.    Farmer Participation.  The Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover&#13;
Programme, the project's principal component, integrates farmer participation&#13;
in the rehabilitation and modernization process, and in subsequent operations&#13;
and maintenance. Farmers have been involved from the outset of project&#13;
planning activities, and considerable interest in participation has been&#13;
evidenced. This has been fostered by WRO staff, consultants and NGOs through&#13;
a series of field based and more formal meetings and workshops. Training of&#13;
WRO staff and field extension efforts is now in a more intensive phase, in&#13;
preparation for the major effort required for this progranmne. On several&#13;
commands, farmers have already mobilized to form informal councils, and&#13;
collected funds from their members. Investment will be phased and directly&#13;
linked to the degree of farmer organization achieved. The final phase in&#13;
particular would require substantial cormitment from farmers, and would&#13;
involve turnover of operations and maintenance of distributaries to farmer&#13;
councils, duly organized as registered societies under acceptable by-laws, and&#13;
under a memorandum of understanding with WRO spelling out the rights and&#13;
obligations of each party. Prior to investment, farmers would contribute Rs&#13;
250/ha to capitalize their maintenance account, and would contribute 20%&#13;
against the investment costs of distributary linings, and handle themselves&#13;
the bulk of the construction work for watercourses and field channels.&#13;
Implementation of this programme is recognised by WRO as its major challenge,&#13;
and has already been the subject of a substantial staff familiarization and&#13;
training effort, and assistance from consultants.&#13;
3.    Public par-tiipation anA NrnO-.  Basin planning, while primarily&#13;
implemented by WRO, will involve a multi-sectoral decision forum through the&#13;
WRCRC created for this purpose, and local advisory committees at basin level&#13;
including non-governmental participation. Other components such as the&#13;
research fund, consultancy arrangements and training make extensive use of&#13;
resources available in Tamnil Nadu's universities, in India and overseas,&#13;
including a particular focus on technology transfer, necessary to WRO's&#13;
objectives to create specialization and state-of-the-art approaches to the&#13;
increasing complexities of water management in a resource constrained&#13;
situation. WRO will also sponsor seminars of various kinds to develop public&#13;
understanding of water management and environmental issues, and to tap ideas&#13;
available from the general public, academia and business sectors. NGOs will&#13;
be used as the primary party for field implementation of economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

rehabilitation (see below), and as community organizers assisting WRO 3taff&#13;
for farmer participation and turnover.&#13;
4.    Women and Scheduled Castes.  The interests of women and scheduled castes&#13;
have been targeted for specific care in implementation of, in particular,&#13;
farmer organization and turnover, and land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation. Features to handle this have been incorporated in both&#13;
components, in the latter through the special socio-economic surveys and&#13;
resultant tailoring of action plans answering to the specific needs of&#13;
individuals as well as cormmunities, and in both components through use of&#13;
trained community organizers, preferably from the local community.  In the&#13;
case of farmer participation, an effort is being made to staff each two-person&#13;
NGO team with a man and a woman, so that outreach will stand the best chance&#13;
of fully integrating women's interests.&#13;
5.    Poverty Alleviation.  The project is directly supportive of Tamil Nadu's&#13;
focus on poverty alleviation. Most farms in Tamil Nadu are small. The&#13;
average holding size is 1 ha, with 71% of holdings less than 1 ha, and 88%&#13;
less than 2 ha. The project would improve the incomes and living standards of&#13;
small (less than 1 ha for irrigated lands) and marginal (less than 0.5 ha)&#13;
farmers - estimated between them to form some 70% of beneficiaries - through&#13;
improved and equitable distribution of water, resulting in higher yields,&#13;
increased food production and diversification to higher value crops. About&#13;
50% (650,000 ha) of Tamil Nadu's surface irrigated area would benefit from the&#13;
project. Some 600,000 families (about 3.6 million persons) would be direct&#13;
beneficiaries, with spin-off benefits to a larger population (landless, urban&#13;
poor) through employment opportunities from more intensive agriculture and&#13;
increased and lower price food production. Employment opportunities for&#13;
landless families in the command areas would be substantially increased, as&#13;
labor needs are closely linked to crop intensification and yields.  For the&#13;
urban poor, the project's water planning component would yield benefits&#13;
through planning of future bulk water supply needs.&#13;
6     The remainder of this social assessment summarises the land acquisition&#13;
and economic rehabilitation programmue to be implemented under the project. In&#13;
preparation of this component the aims have been two-fold: first to ensure&#13;
that the individual needs of persons affected are met; and secondly, to create&#13;
capability for handling land acquisition and economic rehabilitation in the&#13;
future. The latter has involved creating institutional capability and&#13;
adjusting policies and procedures. In turn, this is expected to substantially&#13;
affect the chances for success of the first and primary objective.&#13;
Land Acquisl$-{n  -a Innnom1c RohAhilsaAtinn&#13;
7.    Tamil Nadu intends to ensure that persons affected by land acquisition&#13;
activities under the WRCP are provided with full compensation and economic&#13;
rehabilitation to enable all such families to retain or surpass their previous&#13;
standards of living. This would be achieved through implementation of land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation action plans at each site concerned.&#13;
Opportunity has also been taken, based on the recommendationa of a review of&#13;
state policy, procedures and experience, undertaken by consultants and&#13;
reviewed by the World Bank, to create a permanent institutional capability&#13;
within WRO to handle land acquisition and economic rehabilitation under WRO's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

responsibility, and to adjust policies and procedures to resolve weaknesses or&#13;
constraints in WRO's current practices.&#13;
8.    A Baseline consultants survey has reviewed all project sites to&#13;
determine the extent of land acquisition involved and the nature of&#13;
compensation and economic rehabilitation required. The survey included both&#13;
land acquisition for eight small reservoirs to be constructed, and land&#13;
acquisition and persons affected by new canals and other distribution&#13;
infrastructure. In total, about 600 ha of lands would need to be acquired for&#13;
the WRCP, distributed over nine sites as presented below. Households involved&#13;
are estimated at 603 comprising 1247 "project affected persons". About 70% of&#13;
the 600 families involved would have less than 50% of their land holding&#13;
acquired.   No village sites require resettlement and only 12 dwellings would&#13;
be affected. The survey found that actions required would be able to be&#13;
accommodated without major individual or community disruptions, as the&#13;
predominant situation involved agricultural lands only, and often only part of&#13;
the holding, and possibilities to acquire alternative lands or other income&#13;
earning opportunities were present in the local community.&#13;
9.    The baseline survey and preliminary rehabilitation plan assessments are&#13;
being followed up by preparation, by ORG consultants in association with WRO&#13;
and local administrations, of detailed socio-economic surveys and Land&#13;
Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (LAERAPs), following&#13;
guidelines provided by the World Bank. On two locations involving one family&#13;
each (Rajathopekanar and Kodumudiyar), LAERAPs were found not needed as the&#13;
land holdings are large and compensation procedures alone would apply. On the&#13;
other seven locations, two LAERAPs are finalized, three ongoing and expected&#13;
ready by September 1994, and two are commencing and expected ready in early&#13;
1995.&#13;

11.   Tmprovements in Tnstitutional Capahility.  To implement the WRCP's Land&#13;
Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Prograrmne, and to establish&#13;
permanent capability for future state needs in the water sector, a Land&#13;
Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation Office (LAERO) has been established in&#13;
WRO, reporting to the Secretary, PWD (G.O. Ms.No.138, Feb 15, 94) and headed&#13;
by a Special Officer with experience in rural administration. The LAERO will&#13;
be directly responsible for planning, supervising and monitoring the LAERAPs,&#13;
and will also serve as the Secretariat for a State level Coordinating&#13;
Committee comprising the Secretary of PWD (Chairman), Land Administration&#13;
Commissioner, Secretaries of Rural Development, Agriculture, Livestock and&#13;
Fisheries, WRCP Director and CE/EIC WRO, and the district Collectors where&#13;
LAER is involved. At district levels, Negotiation Committees and Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation and Grievance Committees, chaired by the district Collector,&#13;
will ensure local coordination, including channelling all relevant district&#13;
development progranmes to assist with economic rehabilitation. For each LAER&#13;
site, an NGO with suitable hands-on experience in rural development and&#13;
community organisation will be contracted by LAERO to undertake primary&#13;
responsibility for implementing the economic rehabilitation programme and to&#13;
represent the interests of PAPs (rights and entitlements), organise community&#13;
participation and handle women's needs, and facilitate access to ongoing&#13;
Government development schemes. A full-time WRO official will also be&#13;
delegated at each site to provide WRO assistance. The WRCP will fund the&#13;
technical assistance and training required by the institutional changes and&#13;
activities included under the LAER and economic rehabilitation action&#13;
programme. The above arrangements follow the recommendations of the&#13;
consultants and the World Bank and have been designed to provide the&#13;
implementation capacity to effectively implement the programme.&#13;
12.   Tmrovements in Prnnedurem and Econnmin Rehabilitation.  Land&#13;
acquisition and compensation in Tamil Nadu is based on the Land Acquisition&#13;
Act of 1894 as amended in 1984, and as applied and implemented by relevant&#13;
Government Orders. Weaknesses in the present procedures cause delays in&#13;
settling land acquisition, cases of inadequate compensation, and incomplete&#13;
follow-up to ensure full economic rehabilitation. The procedures and benefits&#13;
have been amended for the WRCP.  First, land valuation by negotiated&#13;
mettlemant will be an alternative available for PAPs to the present lengthy&#13;
methods. It will enable more speed and flexibility in determining&#13;
compensation levels based on full market value and transaction costs for&#13;
purchase of fully equivalent agricultural land, thus giving more opportunity&#13;
for enhanced benefits. A Government Order (G.O.M3.No. 128; Feb 11, 1994) to&#13;
put this amendment into effect has been issued. Second, the definition of&#13;
PAPs will be adjusted, following recommendations of the World Bank, and will&#13;
include landless PAPa (encroachera, sharecroppers and tenant farmers). Third,&#13;
arrangements for land prnvis;in will be adjusted. A first option available to&#13;
marginal farmers with incomes below the poverty line would be provision of&#13;
productively comparable land-for-land with purchase assisted by the NGO. The&#13;
land would be identified by the PAPa within a well-defined geographic area&#13;
near the village or in the command area. The terms of replacement would be on&#13;
an equal basis of one acre of dryland lost to one acre of replacement dryland,&#13;
or one-half acre of replacement irrigated land. Compensation paid for the&#13;
land lost would be paid to the cost of the replacement land, with any&#13;
difference being borne by GOTN. As a second option, a farmer may elect to&#13;
receive Rs 14,000/ha of dryland lost (or ?s. 28,000/ha for irrigated land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 15 of 17&#13;
lost) as Rehahi1itation Grant Fund (RGF) up to a maximum of six acres of&#13;
unirrigated or three acres of irrigated land lost. The amount would be&#13;
deposited by the NGO in a joint bank account with withdrawal against signature&#13;
of the PAP, the NGO and the LAERO. Withdrawals would be linked to purchase of&#13;
productive assets such as farm animals or implements, or for self-employment,&#13;
or other income-generating activities. Fourth, both the land-for-land option&#13;
and the RGF option would be supplemented by provision of an Asset Maintenance&#13;
Grant (AMG) of Rs 500/month/family applied from date of takeover of land by&#13;
WRO when the landowner loses his right to cultivate the land, and ends with&#13;
either possession of replacement land or one year after establishment of the&#13;
joint bank account. The AMG would be to ensure that the PAPs are not obliged&#13;
to sell existing family assets pending restoration of earning ability.&#13;
Finally, through the district economic rehabilitation committees and assisted&#13;
by the NGOs, existing rural development programmes would be specifically&#13;
targeted to land acquisition sites (many prograimmes exist; eg IRDP, the&#13;
sericulture project, horticulture, dairy cooperative development, fisheries,&#13;
NABARD credit facilities, programme for development of women and children in&#13;
rural areas and various vocational training schemes). The objective would be&#13;
to create a record of tangible gain in welfare and earning capabilities for&#13;
PAPs. The remaining Government Orders relevant to the above are targeted for&#13;
issuance by September, 1994.&#13;
13.   The LAER would be supported by IDA funding of equipment, vehicles,&#13;
training and consultancies. IDA would also finance LAERO's contracts with&#13;
NGOs, including, within the contracts, the NGO's provision of rehabilitation&#13;
grant fund and aaset maintenance grant fund. LAER monitoring and special&#13;
auditing procedures would apply to ensure the RGF and AMG was used for&#13;
creation of productive assets and safeguarding of existing assets. The&#13;
consultancy assistance would include an annual review by an independent&#13;
consultant of the status of PAPs at all sites. In addition to the ongoing&#13;
work to finalize the LAERAPs, staff training is underway and an initial set of&#13;
equipment has been purchased to provide LAERO and other staff involved with&#13;
the necessary skills and facilitiea to do their work.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Water Resources Research Fund&#13;
1.    Tamil Nadu, through its Water Resources Organization (WRO) and a number of&#13;
related agencies will undertake new efforts in water resources planning and&#13;
management by basins, taking into account competing uses of water, irrigation&#13;
management improvements and intensive farmer participation. A large effort is&#13;
required to update knowledge and skills of WRO staff, identify problems at field&#13;
level and provide solutions through applied research. The research units within&#13;
PWD have been focused on technical aspects and need support to broaden their&#13;
research mandate to other areas like agriculture, economics, environment,water&#13;
management, and social sciences. Universities and other research institutions&#13;
offer excellent research facilities and a broad expertise in these areas, but&#13;
academic research has been often not sufficiently operations oriented.&#13;
2.    The policy, institutional and technological reforms needed for meeting the&#13;
new challenges are complex and need careful analysis, adaptive and applied&#13;
research and experimentation. The Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF) under the&#13;
WRCP would support a practical program of research to assist in the formulation&#13;
and implementation of the substantial reforms to be implemented in the water&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.    Water Resources Research Fund (WRRF): The Water Resources Research Fund&#13;
(WRRF) will fulfill an essential need under Tamil Nadu's program to modernize&#13;
management and planning of its water and land resources under WRCP. In total 3&#13;
million US$ will be earmarked to fund high quality applied research relevant to&#13;
Tamil Nadu's present and future water sector. The WRRF objectives will be to:&#13;
i)    Promote the culture of applied research among water and irrigation&#13;
professionals in the field;&#13;
ii)   Identify and support applied and problem solving research,&#13;
specifically addressed to land and water production and&#13;
sustainability in the water and irrigation sector, especially at the&#13;
river basin level;&#13;
iii) Promote research on social issues, such as farmer's and women's and&#13;
disadvantaged groups participation in field level activities and&#13;
decision making for better management; and&#13;
iv)   Promote cooperation between WRO and research institutions from Tamil&#13;
Nadu, India, and overseas.&#13;
4.    Oraanizational Framework:  The WRRF would be administered by a project&#13;
officer in the office of the Engineer in Chief (EIC). The project officer would&#13;
convene quarterly meetings, in consultation with the EIC and the Research&#13;
Advisory Committee (RAC). He will prepare invitations, and circulate proposals&#13;
and the agenda to the committee members.&#13;
5.    The Research Advisory Committee (RAC) would be established to ensure the&#13;
quality and the applied nature of the research, and to advise the Engineer in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -               Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Chief (EIC) on research projects. The RAC would not have administrative&#13;
responsibilities but provide scientific and professional advice to WRO on&#13;
research matters.  The RAC would screen the research proposals for their quality&#13;
and relevance, assess the capability of each applicant to carry out the research,&#13;
advise on modifications to the proposal as needed, review the proposed cost&#13;
submitted by the applicant, monitor the research progress and suggest mid term&#13;
corrections if necessary. Based on the number of received proposals, the RAC&#13;
would recommend a priority list of proposals to the EIC (WRO) who would make the&#13;
final decision on selection, priority and funding. The RAC would also take a&#13;
proactive role in identifying and promoting problem solving research and&#13;
technology transfers in the water sector of the state.&#13;
6.    The RAC would consist of not more than five senior experts, in addition to&#13;
the EIC (or his delegate) as Member Secretary. These experts would have&#13;
outstanding capabilities in the following areas of specialty: (i) water&#13;
resource/hydraulic engineering, (ii) agricultural science, (iii) environmental&#13;
science, (iv) economics and social science, and (v) other areas of relevance.&#13;
The members of the RAC would present a mixture of those with practical experience&#13;
and those with academic experience and at least one member with experience in the&#13;
urban and industrial sector. Members should not include active government staff.&#13;
In any situation where a RAC member is actively involved with an applicant&#13;
institution, the member would exclude himself from the committee's deliberations&#13;
on that proposal. Members would be appointed by the EIC.&#13;
7.    Methodoloav:  The RAC would have the following responsibilities:&#13;
i)    Organize workshops at Madras and especially at river basin level with&#13;
participation from reputed universities, including agricultural&#13;
universities, individual researchers, as well as water users , and&#13;
identify problems relevant to Tamil Nadu's water use and to specific&#13;
river basins;&#13;
ii)   Identify problem areas based on their experience and critical review&#13;
of water and river basin issues;&#13;
iii) Short-list research proposals and identify researchers and&#13;
institutions for support;&#13;
iv)   Publicly advertise and invite research proposals from within the&#13;
state as well as conjunctive research of state institutions with&#13;
either Indian or overseas institutions;&#13;
v)    Review the research and special study program of WRO under the&#13;
responsibility of CE Plan Formulation, IHH, IWS, and IMTI; and&#13;
vi)   Submit its recommendations to the EIC, WRO.&#13;
8.    Research proposals emanating from different streams suggested above would&#13;
be considered by the RAC, and discussed in detail with the applicants. The&#13;
proposed research should normally be not longer than 2 years, with a possible&#13;
extension to a third year. In exceptional cases the research could continue for&#13;
a fourth and final year. Each proposal should provide full justification of&#13;
estimated costs (e.g. laboratory equipment, salary of research scholars, research&#13;
assistants, enumerators etc., recurring costs for chemicals, glassware etc.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -                   Anex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
costs of demonstrations and piloting, travel costs including national and&#13;
international travel but excluding the purchase of vehicles, participation in&#13;
seminars/workshops, and contingencies).&#13;
9.    The WRRF suggests priority research topics in Tamil Nadu such as:&#13;
i)    Cross-sectoral (municipal, industrial, agricultural etc.) issues in&#13;
water management and planning;&#13;
ii)   Cross-sectoral linkages between agriculture, irrigation, forestry and&#13;
land use;&#13;
iii)  Hydrology, system design and engineering;&#13;
iv)   Water resource allocation, water markets and water prices;&#13;
v)    Ground water regulation and pricing (incl. variable cost pricing and&#13;
metering);&#13;
vi)   Basin management and basin planing;&#13;
vii)  Farmer and local participation in water management and system&#13;
turnover;&#13;
viii) Role of women, marginal farmers, and other target groups in water&#13;
management and system turnover;&#13;
ix)   Water efficient irrigation systems and new technologies; and&#13;
x)    Environmental impacts of irrigation, drainage, urban and industrial&#13;
use.&#13;
10.   Research proposals submitted to the WRRF have to oriain from research and&#13;
related institutions located in Tamil Nadu. However. the WRRF actively&#13;
encouraaes research proposals jointly prepared by research institutions from&#13;
Tamil Nadu with Indian or overseas institutions. Such conjunctive research&#13;
facilitates the transfer of technologies and expertise from abroad to further&#13;
improve the water sector. An example for proposed research collaboration is a&#13;
proposal by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore and International&#13;
Food and Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Washington on "Water Resource&#13;
Allocation: Productivity and Environmental Impacts in Tamil Nadu, India".&#13;
11.   Financina:  IDA funding of the WRRF under the WRCP would cover 100% of the&#13;
grants awarded by the EIC and 100% of honoraria of the RAC and other reasonable&#13;
RAC costs. Disbursement would be against expenditures on contracts or against&#13;
certificates of expenditures under such contracts. To enable the progressive&#13;
build-up of a permanent fund, GOTN would provide matching grants into an interest&#13;
earning account for the WRRF with contributions to the account made quarterly&#13;
equivalent to one-third of IDA disbursements in the preceding quarter.&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
LAND ACOUISITION AND ECONOMIC REHABILITATION (LAER) PLAN&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Land Acouisition and Economic Rehabilitation Action Plan (LAERAP),&#13;
to be implemented and funded under the WRCP and described below, is a&#13;
comprehensive action plan to fully address the needs of all project affected&#13;
persons (PAPs) under the WRCP. It includes: establishment of a new&#13;
institutional structure in PWD/WRO to handle land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation (LAER); revised policies and procedures for LAER including use&#13;
of negotiated purchase procedures to provide higher and speedier compensation;&#13;
revised definitions of PAPs, including landless and major children; additional&#13;
entitlements for PAPs including introduction of economic rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance grants in addition to compensation for land acquisition; targeting&#13;
of existing government development programs for specific benefit of PAPs,&#13;
including project funding of a fisheries income-generating scheme; and&#13;
implementation, with assistance of NGOs, of site-specific land acquisition and&#13;
economic rehabilitation action plans. The program is also supported with&#13;
consultancy and training assistance, underway since early 1994, and includes&#13;
special monitoring and independent consultant evaluation procedures. While&#13;
the land acquisition needs for the WRCP are fairly small (para. 6), the&#13;
objective of the WRCP's LAERAP is to provide not only a record of tangible and&#13;
sustainable gain for the WRCP's PAPs, but to establish permanent capability&#13;
and state-wide experience for handling all future LAER in Tamil Nadu's water&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.    The paragraphs below and supporting attachments provide summary&#13;
background of LAER in Tamil Nadu, description of LAER needs, component&#13;
objectives, description of institutional strengthening measures, definitions&#13;
of PAPs, entitlements, roles of NGOs, training, project support, and&#13;
financing. A Matrix, summarizing LAER Obiectives and Actions. is at&#13;
Attachment 1. The Implementation Schedule is at Attachment 2. The new&#13;
Institutional Structure for LAER is at Attachment 3. Attachments 4 and 5&#13;
provide summary data on extent of land acauisition and proiect affected&#13;
persons. Finally, Attachment 6 summarizes the fisheries income-aenerating&#13;
scheme, also to be funded under the project. The site-specific socio-economic&#13;
surveys and LAERAPs, providing details by site and by family/PAP are in&#13;
separate supporting documentation. All policy, procedural, entitlement,&#13;
institutional (including staffing and initial training), and other measures&#13;
described in the action plan below were officially announced by Government&#13;
(Government Orders) or implemented during project preparation so as to ensure&#13;
a complete and already established basis for the implementation phase of the&#13;
LAERAP.&#13;

B. BACKGROUND&#13;
3.    Because Tamil Nadu has limited water resources, it has not had a history&#13;
of substantial resettlement due to the development of large scale reservoirs.&#13;
It is also a state which has almost completed the development of its&#13;
irrigation potential which means that there is limited scope for new&#13;
irrigation and that future emphasis will be on rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of existing irrigation networks. The state uses the Land&#13;
Acqusition Act of 1984 (LAA) as a basis for determining land compensation,&#13;
though actual procedures may be modified by relevant Government Orders. Given&#13;
the limitation on future irrigation expansion, land acquisition needs in Tamil&#13;
Nadu are not large, but improved compensation and economic rehabilitation are&#13;
needed for all such cases. The project has provided an opportunity to&#13;
introduce policy, institutional, and procedural improvements to ensure full&#13;
compensation to and sustainable livelihoods of project affected persons&#13;
(PAPs). The improvements introduced would be of benefit both to the land&#13;
acquisition during the WRCP and for all future land acquisition cases in the&#13;
water sector.&#13;
4.    The main problem that faces project affected persons in Tamil Nadu has&#13;
been their restoration to their former living standards prior to land&#13;
acquisition. This is attributable mainly to low level of compensation&#13;
provided under the LAA and to delays in processing the land acquisition. For&#13;
small and marginal farmers, the gap between possession of the land and payment&#13;
of compensation has often resulted in a substantial loss of income and&#13;
increasing indebtedness.&#13;
5.    Under the WRCP, Tamil Nadu is committed to implementing corrective&#13;
measures to address this through: (i) creation of a permanant institutional&#13;
capability within WRO to handle land acquisition and economic rehabilitation&#13;
in the water resources sector; (ii) adjustment of its policies, procedures and&#13;
entitlements to resolve weaknesses or constraints in PWD/WRO's current&#13;
practices; and (iii) implementation, with assistance of NGOs and consultants,&#13;
of site-specific land acquisition and economic rehabilitation action plans.&#13;
C. DESCRIPTION OF LAND ACOUISITION&#13;
6.    A Baseline Survey by consultants has reviewed all project sites to&#13;
determine the extent of land acquisition involved and the nature of&#13;
compensation and economic rehabilitation required. The survey included both&#13;
land acquisition for eight small reservoirs to be constructed, and land&#13;
acquisition and persons affected by new canals and other distribution&#13;
infrastructure. In total, about 570 ha of private lands would need to be&#13;
acquired for the WRCP, plus 280 ha of government lands, primarily unused&#13;
wastelands, and 110 ha of forest lands (neither of them have any affected&#13;
persons), distributed over nine sites as presented below (Attachment 4).&#13;
Households involved are estimated at about 710 comprising 1460 PAPs&#13;
(Attachment 5). About 70% of the 711 families involved would have less than&#13;
50% of their land holding acquired. No village residential sites require&#13;
resettlement and, statewide, only 12 dwellings would be displaced by the WRCP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
investments.  A number of families are losing more than 75% of their land but&#13;
with the Rehabilitation Grants and Asset Maintenance Grants being provided&#13;
under the project, it is expected that they will be able to restore their&#13;
standard of living without needing to relocate.  The survey found that actions&#13;
required could be accommodated without major individual or community&#13;
disruptions, as (except for 12 dwellings noted above) land acquisition&#13;
involved agricultural lands only, and usually only a small part of the&#13;
holding, and possibilities to acquire alternative lands or other income&#13;
earning opportunities were present in the local community.&#13;
7.    The baseline survey and preliminary rehabilitation plan assessments were&#13;
followed by preparation by consultants in association with PWD/WRO and local&#13;
administrations, of detailed socio-economic surveys and Land Acquisition and&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (LAERAPs). On two locations involving&#13;
one family each (Rajathopekanar and Kodumudiyar), LAERAPs were found not&#13;
needed as the land holdings are large and compensation procedures alone would&#13;
apply. On the other seven locations, socio-economic surveys and LAERAPs have&#13;
been completed, with one (Vadakku Pachayar) undergoing final revisions.&#13;

D. COMPONENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
8.    The objective of this component is to ensure that persons affected by&#13;
land acquisition under the Project are left as well off or better off than&#13;
their previous situation. To meet this objective, the following measures are&#13;
being adopted:&#13;
(a) strengthening of the institutional capacity to expedite LAER&#13;
through the establishment of a special cell for LAER within the PWD/WRO&#13;
and district level negotiations and economic rehabilitation and&#13;
grievance committees;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
(b) assistance to PAPs provided by NGOs for purchase of&#13;
productive assets, for self-employment, or for other income-&#13;
generating activities including associated funding through&#13;
economic rehabilitation and asset maintenance grants;&#13;
(c) assistance to PAPs to facilitate their access, through NGO's&#13;
assistance, to existing government poverty alleviation programs and&#13;
income-generating schemes.&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING&#13;
9.    To strengthen PWD/WRO's capacity to deal with LAER matters, a special&#13;
cell for the land acquisition and economic rehabilitation program (LAERP) has&#13;
been established in the PWD/WRO, headed by a Special Land Acquisition and&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Officer (LAERO) reporting directly to the Secretary,&#13;
PWD/WRO. He will be directly responsible for planning, coordinating and&#13;
monitoring land acquisition and economic rehabilitation under the project. He&#13;
will also be responsible for contracting with NGOs to carry out site-specific&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (ERAPs) for each subproject and to&#13;
oversee NGOs' functions and for setting up and providing approval for the&#13;
joint accounts established under the ERAPs. Under the special LAER officer&#13;
(at senior rank, i.e. IAS), the Cell is staffed with an Assistant Executive&#13;
Engineer, two Assistant Engineers and supporting technical and clerical staff,&#13;
plus a full- time Assistant Engineer (LAER) at each field site. A consulting&#13;
firm experienced in LAER has been assisting the LAER Cell in undertaking&#13;
socio-economic surveys, preparing land acquisition and economic rehabilitation&#13;
action plans, and training PWD/WRO staff over the past year. A consulting&#13;
firm with experience in preparing and implementing resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation action plans would be employed during the WRCP period on a long&#13;
term contract to assist the Cell in implementing the LAER component.&#13;
10.   The LAERP Cell would serve as the secretariat for a state level&#13;
Coordinating Committee for LAER under WRCP. This Committee is chaired by the&#13;
Secretary, WRO, and has the following members: Commisssioner, Land&#13;
Administration, Secretaries of Finance and Rural Development, Development&#13;
Commissioner, WRCP Director, Engineer-in-Chief, PWD/WRO, the District&#13;
Collectors where project sites are situated, and the Special Land Acquisition&#13;
and Economic Rehabilitation Officer (member secretary).&#13;
11.   At the district level, the LAERP Cell would be supported by the&#13;
Negotiations Committee and the Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance&#13;
Committee. The Negotiations Committee, whose members consist of the District&#13;
Collector as Chairman, the District Revenue Officer, and the Assistant&#13;
Executive Engineer, LAERO, will have the authority to conduct negotiations&#13;
with landowners and/or their NGO representative to establish a full and fair&#13;
valuation of the land. The Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance Committee&#13;
would be responsible for local coordination, and monitoring the implementation&#13;
of the Rehabilitation Action Plans, including channelling all relevant&#13;
district development programs to assist with economic rehabilitation. It&#13;
would be chaired by the District Collector and would have the following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
membership: Project Officer DRDA, District Revenue Officer, relevant&#13;
representatives from ongoing development programs in the district, the&#13;
Commands' Executive/Assistant Engineers, and the NGOs assisting with the&#13;
implementation of the RAPs. The Committee would also be charged with&#13;
providing a grievance mechanism to hear and determine fairly and in good&#13;
faith, and after taking into account the LAER criteria, all complaints raised&#13;
in relation to land acquisition and compensation. Attached is the&#13;
organization chart (Attachment 3).&#13;
12.   For each LAER site, an NGO with suitable hands-on experience in rural&#13;
development and community organization will be contracted by LAERO to&#13;
undertake primary responsibility for implementation of the economic&#13;
rehabilitation program and to represent the interests of PAPs (rights and&#13;
entitlements), organize community participation and handle women's needs, and&#13;
facilitate access to ongoing Government development schemes. A full-time WRO&#13;
official has been delegated at each site to provide assistance. The WRCP will&#13;
fund the technical assistance and training required by the institutional&#13;
changes and activities included under the LAER program, and fund incremental&#13;
staff needs. The above arrangements have been designed to provide the&#13;
implementation capacity to effectively implement the WRCP program and to&#13;
create a permanent capacity in Tamil Nadu for future LAER needs in the water&#13;
sector.&#13;
13.   Definition of Project Affected Person (PAP): Based on the results of the&#13;
socio-economic surveys, five categories of PAPs have been identified (the&#13;
definitions of small and marginal farmers and the poverty line are the&#13;
standard definitions used in India):&#13;
Categorv 1: Small farmers (less than 2 hectares of dry land or 1 hectare of&#13;
irrigated land) and marginal farmers (less than 1 hectare of dry land or 0.5&#13;
hectares of irrigated land)&#13;
Cateaorv 2: Landowners with incomes below the poverty line of Rs. 11,000 per&#13;
year&#13;
Cateaorv 3: Landowners losing more than 50% of their land who are not&#13;
included in Categories 1 and 2 or those landowners who have lost complete&#13;
access to their lands due to the construction of the reservoir or canals and&#13;
are unable to cultivate their lands&#13;

F. ENTITLEMENTS&#13;
14.   PAPs whose land or part thereof has been acquired for the purpose of the&#13;
Project are entitled to compensation for such land acquired. Moreover, this&#13;
category of PAPs, together with the other categories, are entitled to two new&#13;
provisions under the project: Rehabilitation Grant (RG) and Asset Maintenance&#13;
Grant (AMG).&#13;
15.   ComDensation for Land Accuisition.  Under the LAA, district level&#13;
Negotiating Committees have been established for the WRCP which has the&#13;
authority to conduct negotiations with the landowners to establish a full and&#13;
fair valuation of the land. If the negotiating process does not result in&#13;
agreement ("consent award"), then land acquisition proceedings continue using&#13;
the normal procedures established under the Act. Negotiated settlement is,&#13;
however, expected to be the more commonly chosen option of PAPs as experience&#13;
using negotiated settlement has resulted in higher and faster compensation&#13;
than the standard land acquisition and compensation procedures.&#13;
16.   Additionally, two further entitlements would be provided to assist in&#13;
economic rehabilitation. The Rehabilitation Grant (RG) would assist PAPs in&#13;
acquisition of productive assets for sustainable economic rehabilitation&#13;
(para. 17). Also, for all project affected families, an Asset Maintenance&#13;
Grant (AMG) would be provided from the date of takeover of land by PWD/WRO&#13;
when the landowner loses his right to cultivate the land and ends with either&#13;
possession of replacement land or one year after establishment of the joint&#13;
bank account for the RG (para. 19).&#13;
17.   Rehabilitation Grant (RG): There are two options under the&#13;
Rehabilitation Grant. The first option available to small and marginal&#13;
farmers with incomes below the poverty line would be provision of productively&#13;
comparable land-for-land with assistance by NGO. The land would be identified&#13;
by the PAPs within a well-defined geographic area near the village or in the&#13;
command area within a specific time frame. The terms of replacement would be&#13;
on the basis of one acre of dryland lost to one acre of replacement dryland,&#13;
or one half acre of replacement irrigated land, up to a maximum of six acres&#13;
of unirrigated land or three acres of irrigated land.   Compensation paid for&#13;
the land lost would be applied to the cost of the replacement land. The&#13;
government would provide the difference between the amount compensated and the&#13;
sale price of the replacement land. The sale price would be negotiated&#13;
between a willing buyer and willing seller.&#13;
18.   As a second option, a farmer may elect to  receive, in addition to&#13;
compensation for land acquisition, a rehabilitation grant of Rs.14,000/ha of&#13;
dryland lost (or Rs.28,000/ha for irrigated land lost) up to a maximum of six&#13;
acres of unirrigated or three acres of irrigated land lost.   The amount would&#13;
be deposited by the NGO in a joint bank account with withdrawal against&#13;
signatures of the PAP, the NGO, and the LAERO. Withdrawals would be linked to&#13;
purchase of productive assets, excluding land, such as farm animals or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
agricultural implements, or for self-employment (e.g. equipment for&#13;
establishing a small business) or other income-generating activities.&#13;
19.   Asset Maintenance Grant (AMG): For all orolect affected families (PAFs)&#13;
(defined in terms of one family represented by one kitchen) choosing either&#13;
the land-for-land option or the RGF option, a supplemental Asset Maintenance&#13;
Grant (AMG) of Rs. 500 per month would be provided. Payments would start from&#13;
the date that the PWD/WRO takes over the land for construction, when the&#13;
landowner loses his right to cultivate the land, and ends with either the&#13;
possession of replacement land or one year after the opening of the joint&#13;
account for the RGF. The purpose of the AMG would be to ensure that the PAPs&#13;
are not obliged to sell existing family assets pending restoration of earning&#13;
ability. The LAERP Cell would be responsible for making these payments&#13;
through the NGOs and would include retroactive payments due.&#13;
G. ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES (NGOS)&#13;
20.   NGOs have an important role to play in the implementation of the land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation and action plans (LAERAPs). The&#13;
LAERAPs for each subproject have been prepared by consultants who are&#13;
assisting the LAERP Cell in identifying one NGO per subproject to assist in&#13;
its implementation. For each LAER site, an NGO with suitable hands-on&#13;
experience in rural development community organization will be contracted by&#13;
LAERO to undertake primary responsibility for implementing the economic&#13;
rehabilitation programme and to represent the interest of PAPs (rights and&#13;
entitlements), organize community participation and handle women's needs.&#13;
Criteria for NGO selection are at Annex 18 of the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
21.   The NGOs would also work with the PAPs and the ERGC to assist the PAPs&#13;
in obtaining benefits from ongoing government poverty alleviation schemes.&#13;
The Department of Rural Development has indicated that PAPs under WRCP would&#13;
be given priority treatment under these ongoing schemes in their district.&#13;
22.   A fisheries income-generating scheme to be conducted by a Fisheries&#13;
Officer from the Fisheries Department deputed to WRO is also included&#13;
(Attachment 6). This scheme would provide freshwater fisheries and&#13;
aquaculture employment opportunities for project affected households in the&#13;
vicinity of eight small reservoirs suitable for fisheries enhancement. In&#13;
addition to the direct beneficiaries taking up fish production activities, it&#13;
is anticipated that others conducting support activities (hatchery operators,&#13;
feed suppliers, fish traders, ice suppliers, etc.) in the project area would&#13;
also be indirectly benefitted.&#13;
23.   Other ongoing government poverty alleviation schemes which have been&#13;
identified for targeting PAPs in the WRCP project area include the Integrated&#13;
Rural Development Progam (IRDP), the Development of Women and Children in&#13;
Rural Areas (DWCRA), special access to NABARD credit for target groups,&#13;
Training of Women in Agriculture (TANWA) and ongoing World Bank-supported&#13;
projects, such as the Agriculture Development Program-Tamil Nadu, the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
Sericulture Project, and the dairy cooperative program financed by NDDB under&#13;
the Second National Dairy Project.&#13;
24.   Among the other functions of the NGOs would be:&#13;
Creating awareness amoung the PAPs of their rights and entitlements&#13;
under the WRCP, the grievance procedures, and options for economic&#13;
rehabilitation under existing government programs through meetings and&#13;
printed material;&#13;
Facilitating women's development to ensure that they are not adversely&#13;
affected by the loss of land and that they are able to take full&#13;
advantage of the economic rehabilitation program offered by the&#13;
government;&#13;
Organizing community groups to facilitate community participation in the&#13;
economic rehabilitation program, including the identification and&#13;
training of community organizers within the village.&#13;
I. TRAINING&#13;
25.   The object of training for LAER would be to provide the staff of the&#13;
subprojects in WRCP with increased knowledge and skills to deal with the&#13;
social and economic issues related to LAER. The subjects of training would be&#13;
concepts of economic rehabilitation, participatory rural appraisal, women's&#13;
development, linkage with other government schemes, community organization and&#13;
participation, and the role of NGOs. Training would also include the&#13;
preparation of model rehabilitation action plans and setting up indicators for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The methodology for training would be seminar&#13;
presentation, and experience-based learning through group discussions and&#13;
group work. Training has already commenced with three R&amp;R training courses&#13;
for PWD/WRO staff completed, participatory rural appraisal techniques, and&#13;
hands-on operational training, in association with consultants undertaking the&#13;
socio-economic surveys and economic rehabilitation action plans.&#13;
J. PROJECT SUPPORT&#13;
26.   The LAER Component would be supported by IDA funding of equipment,&#13;
vehicles, training and consultancies. IDA would also finance LAERO's&#13;
contracts with NGOs, including, within the contracts, the NGO's provision of&#13;
rehabilitation grant fund. Government would finance land acquisition and&#13;
other compensation measures as well as the Asset Maintenance Grants. LAER&#13;
monitoring and special auditing procedures would apply to ensure the RGF and&#13;
AMG are used for creation of productive assets and safeguarding of existing&#13;
assets. The consultancy assistance would include an annual review by an&#13;
independent consultant of the status of PAPs at all sites. Staff training is&#13;
underway and an initial set of equipment has been purchased to provide LAERO&#13;
and other staff involved with the necessary skills and faciities to do their&#13;
work.&#13;

Land Acquisition and Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Plans (LAERAPs).&#13;
Summary details are: (i) a Special&#13;
Land Acauisition Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Cell within WRO headed&#13;
by a Special Land Acquisition&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Officer - at&#13;
senior (IAS) rank - reporting&#13;
directly to the Secretary WRO. The&#13;
Cell has been given direct&#13;
responsibilities for planning,&#13;
coordinating, implementing, and&#13;
monitoring all land acquisition and&#13;
economic rehabilitation under the&#13;
project, including contracting with&#13;
NGOs to carry out Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans (ERAPs)&#13;
for each field location, and&#13;
overseeing their function and setting&#13;
up and approving joint accounts with&#13;
PAPs established under the ERAPs.&#13;
(ii) A consultina firm with&#13;
experience in preparation and&#13;
implementation of economic&#13;
rehabilitation plans would be&#13;
employed on a long-term contract to&#13;
assist the LAER Cell in implementing&#13;
this component. (iii) The LAER Cell&#13;
would also serve as secretariat for a&#13;
State Level Coordinatina Committee&#13;
for land accuisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation under the WRCP. (iv)&#13;
At the district level, the LAERP Cell&#13;
would be supported by the&#13;
Neaotiations Committee. and the&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation and&#13;
Grievance Committee. The&#13;
Neaotiations Committee has the&#13;
authority to conduct negotiations&#13;
with landowners and their NGO&#13;
representative to establish a full&#13;
and fair valuation of the land. The&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance&#13;
Committee would be responsible for&#13;
local coordination, monitoring and&#13;
implementation of Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Action Plans,&#13;
including channelling all relevant&#13;

In addition to this function this&#13;
committee will also provide a&#13;
grievance mechanism to hear and&#13;
determine fairly and in good faith,&#13;
and after taking into account the&#13;
Land Acquisition Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation criteria, all&#13;
complaints raised in relation to land&#13;

fundina for office support, office&#13;
ecmuiment, vehicles, training.&#13;
consultancies and operatina costs&#13;
have been Provided under the pro-ect.&#13;
(b) Community Participation                Socio-economic surveys and&#13;
preparation of ERAPs have integrally&#13;
involved the PAPs and local&#13;
communities. This was accompanied by&#13;
special training in community&#13;
participation for WRO staff and use&#13;
of the innovatory participatory rural&#13;
appraisal (PRA) technigues. The PRA&#13;
process included transect walk,&#13;
social mapping, trend and seasonality&#13;
analysis, and triangulation as well&#13;
as extensive interviews, group&#13;
sessions and community discussions,&#13;
and was used to involve PAPs and&#13;
project beneficiaries, and GOTN&#13;
officials in a consultation process&#13;
for land valuation, compensation and&#13;
economic rehabilitation.&#13;
(c)   Integration with Host                As no village residential sites will&#13;
Population                                 require resettlement and, statewide,&#13;
only 12 dwellings would be displaced,&#13;
the issue of integration with host&#13;
population does not arise.&#13;
(d)   Socio-Economic Surveys               Census and detailed Socio-economic&#13;
surveys have been completed for&#13;
Ra-athopekanar. Poigavar, Nambivar.&#13;

survey will not be required for&#13;
Kodumudivar which is owned by a sole&#13;
proprietor. The socio-economic&#13;
surveys covered full inventories of&#13;
PAPs and their socio-economic&#13;
profile. household characteristics.&#13;
full resource base, extent of land&#13;
loss, and impact of land loss on&#13;
incomes and on public and social&#13;
infrastructure. The surveys involved&#13;
PAPs' participation and included&#13;
focus group discussions with PAPs and&#13;
community leaders.&#13;
(e)   Legal Framework                     The State uses the Land Acquisition&#13;
Act of 1984 (LAA) as a basis for&#13;
determining land compensation. In&#13;
addition, to strengthen WRO's&#13;
capacity to deal with LAER matters,&#13;
Government Orders (GOs) were issued&#13;
in February 1994 establishing (i) a&#13;
Special Land Acquisition Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation Cell within WRO, (ii)&#13;
optional use by PAPs of negotiated&#13;
settlement and establishment of&#13;
District Negotiations Committees.&#13;
Agreement has been obtained (Letter&#13;
of Development Policy) and GOs are&#13;
expected shortly for the following:&#13;
(i) establishment of District&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation and Grievance&#13;
Committees; (ii) selection criteria&#13;
for PAPs; and (iii) rehabilitation&#13;
grants and asset maintenance grants&#13;
for eligible PAPs.&#13;
(f)   Valuation of and Compensation       PAPs (personally or through an NGO&#13;
for Lost Assets and Entitlements          representing the PAPs) will have the&#13;
option to request negotiated&#13;
settlement . If it does not result in&#13;
a "consent award", then normal land&#13;
acquisition procedures are followed.&#13;
The WRCP would also provide for&#13;
Rehabilitation Grants (RG).   One&#13;
option would be provision of&#13;
productively comoarable land-for-land&#13;
identified by the PAPs within a well-&#13;
defined geographic area near the&#13;
village or in the command. The terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
of replacement would be on an equal&#13;
basis of one acre of dryland lost to&#13;
one acre of replacement dryland, or&#13;
one-half acre for replacement&#13;
irrigated land. Compensation paid for&#13;
the land lost would be applied to the&#13;
cost of replacement land and the&#13;
difference to be borne by GOTN. As a&#13;
second option a farmer may elect to&#13;
receive Rs. 14,000 of dryland lost&#13;
(or Rs. 28,000/ha for irrigated land&#13;
lost) as a rehabilitation grant, in&#13;
addition to compensation for land&#13;
acquisition, up to a maximum of six&#13;
acres of unirrigated or three acres&#13;
of irrigated land lost. The amount&#13;
would be deposited by the NGO in a&#13;
joint bank account with withdrawal&#13;
against signature of the PAP, the NGO&#13;
and the LAERO. Withdrawals would be&#13;
linked to purchase of productive&#13;
assets or for self-employment or&#13;
other income generating activities.&#13;
Both the land-for-land option and the&#13;
rehabilitation grant option would be&#13;
supplemented by an Asset Maintenance&#13;
Grant (AMG) of Rs. 500/month/family&#13;
applied from date of takeover of the&#13;
land by WRO when the landowner loses&#13;
his right to cultivate and ends with&#13;
either possession of replacement land&#13;
or one year after establishment of&#13;
joint bank account.&#13;
(g)   Access to Training, Employment       The Department of Rural Development&#13;
and Credit                                 (DRD) will target WRCP PAPS for&#13;
priority treatment under ongoing&#13;
Dovertv alleviation schemes. The&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans&#13;
identify income-generating&#13;
opportunities for PAPs at each&#13;
subproject location. NGOs in&#13;
conjunction with the District&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Grievance&#13;
Committees will help direct PAPs to&#13;
existing DRD programs such as the&#13;
Integrated Rural Development Program,&#13;
the Development of Women and Children&#13;
in Rural Areas, special access to&#13;

cooperative program financed by the&#13;
Second National Dairy Project. A&#13;
fisheries income-generating scheme is&#13;
also included under the WRCP&#13;
specifically targeted to PAPs.&#13;
(h)   Implementation Schedule,            The Land Acauisition and Economic&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation                 Rehabilitation Cell within WRO would&#13;
be responsible for maintaining a&#13;
system of physical and financial&#13;
reporting to track progress in land&#13;
acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation. Rehabilitation&#13;
Action Plans for each subproject&#13;
would include an implementation plan&#13;
for land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation activities with clear&#13;
linkaaes with construction schedules.&#13;
Additional independent monitoring and&#13;
evaluation by consultants will be&#13;
funded under the proiect which would&#13;
include an assessment of the impact&#13;
of rehabilitation on the livelihood&#13;
of PAPs, identifying constraints to&#13;
rehabilitation, and recommending&#13;
corrective actions. Socio-economic&#13;
data obtained in the course of the&#13;
socio-economic surveys will form the&#13;
data base for an impact evaluation.&#13;
(i)   Shelter, Infrastructure and         As no village residential sites&#13;
Social Services                           require resettlement, there will be&#13;
no disruption to the communities'&#13;
access to social infrastructure and&#13;
services and no loss of accessibility&#13;
to either common property or to&#13;
surrounding villages.&#13;
(j)   Land Tenure Acquisition and         Based on the results of socio-&#13;
Transfer                                  economic surveys, one (of the five)&#13;
categories of PAPs that have been&#13;
identified were the landless:&#13;
sharecroppers, encroachers and tenant&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
LAER - Fisheries Income Generating Schemel&#13;
obiective&#13;
1.    The objective of the fisheries income generating scheme would be to&#13;
develop freshwater fisheries and aquaculture employment opportunities for some&#13;
project affected households in the vicinity of 8 small reservoirs suitable for&#13;
fisheries enhancement.   The total water area for the 8 reservoirs that would&#13;
be developed by the project is 605 ha (Table 1). Also, there are 21 tanks&#13;
directly linked and below Rajathope Kanar (5 Q 130 ha), Mordhana (13 Q 2,640&#13;
ha), and Sothuparai (3 @170 ha) Reservoirs which could possibly also be&#13;
developed for fish production by the project; however, surveys remain to be&#13;
done to determine their suitability for inclusion. The income-generating&#13;
scheme as presently designed and costed is only for the 605 ha reservoir area.&#13;
In addition to the direct beneficiaries taking up fish production activities,&#13;
it is anticipated that others conducting support activities (hatchery&#13;
operators, feed suppliers, fish traders, ice suppliers, etc.) in the project&#13;
area would also be indirectly benefitted. The fisheries sub-component would&#13;
be implemented by the Water Resources Organization (WRO).&#13;

Fish Production Technology&#13;
2.    The fish production strategy would involve two stages.  The first stage&#13;
would concern the culture of suitably sized fingerlings (12.5 - 15 cm) for&#13;
stocking the reservoirs and the second would involve the release and grow-out&#13;
of fingerlings to market size (0.5 - 1.5 kg each) fish of several species&#13;
stocked in a proportion that would optimally exploit the natural feeds&#13;
available in the reservoirs. The approximate stocking ratio of fish species&#13;
1The information provided in this attachment is derived from a&#13;
consultant's report "Scope for Fisheries Development in Tamil Nadu -&#13;
Resources Consolidation Project" by Dr. V. D. Singh and a World Bank&#13;
Office Memorandum dated June 19, 1994, from Ronald Zweig (ASTEN).&#13;

include catla (Catla catla) stocked at 40%, rohu (Labeo rohita) and mrigal&#13;
(Cirrhinus mrigala) stocked at 25% each, and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon&#13;
idella) stocked at 10%. The catla, rohu, and mrigal are endemic to India and&#13;
are known as the Indian Major Carp and the grass carp is an exotic species&#13;
native to China. The grass carp consumes land and aquatic vegetation. It is&#13;
presently propagated and cultured in India, since there is no indigenous&#13;
species with the same feeding habits. All of these species are riverine and&#13;
do not successfully spawn in still waters which thus requires annual&#13;
restocking of fingerlings produced in rearing facilities with the seed derived&#13;
from hatchery produced hatchlings or fry.&#13;
3.    Fingerling Rearing.  There are three options that could be used for the&#13;
culture of fingerlings -- pond, pen, or floating cage culture. If suitable&#13;
ponds (in good condition or needing minor improvements) are available in the&#13;
vicinity of the reservoirs, it would be best to use these for the culture of&#13;
fingerlings followed by pens and then cages. If suitable areas (seasonal water&#13;
depth and appropriate soil conditions) are available, pens would be the next&#13;
best option. Successful pen culture has been demonstrated in Orissa. If&#13;
ponds are not available and pens are not feasible, floating cages could be&#13;
used. Effective cage culture techniques for fingerling production have been&#13;
developed by the Central Institute for Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) facility&#13;
in Bangalore. For the project, calculations have been made for the pen&#13;
culture option from which the investment and operating cost provision could be&#13;
used for pond improvement (if available) or cage culture (if necessary). The&#13;
cost for pen construction is about Rs. 44,000/ha divided into 0.25 ha units&#13;
and operation is about Rs. 110,000/ha/crop, including all inputs as well as&#13;
labor. Fry (3-4 cm) of all species (para. 2) are stocked at a density of&#13;
about 250,000/ha with an estimated survival rate of 50% to 12.5-15 cm size.&#13;
Approximately 5.5 ha of pens would be required for the 605 ha reservoir area.&#13;
4.    Reservoir Fisheries. Two production models for reservoir fisheries would&#13;
be followed. The first, or Model A, would be for reservoirs 50 ha and below&#13;
(with a depth of 1-2 m) for a total area of 155 ha, and the second, Model B,&#13;
for those above 50 ha with a depth of 2-3 m with a total area of 450 ha. From&#13;
Table 1, 5 reservoirs would be managed under Model A and 3 reservoirs under&#13;
Model B. For Model A reservoirs, fingerlings would be stocked at a density of&#13;
1,500 per ha with a production target of 400 kg/ha and for Model B, stocking&#13;
would be 1,000 fingerlings per ha with a production target of 300 kg/ha/yr&#13;
with a survival rate of about 30% of the number stocked each year for both&#13;
Models. The number of fingerlings required for Model A reservoirs would be&#13;
about 233,000 and for Model B reservoirs 450,000 for a total of 683,000 (27.5&#13;
t), and the total incremental fish production at full development would amount&#13;
to about 200 t/yr at a value of approximately Rs. 3.2 million. Growth would be&#13;
the result of the fingerlings consuming natural feeds available in the&#13;
reservoirs. The types and quantities of fishing gears to be used would be&#13;
specified by the WRO, and a closed fishing season would be enacted for two&#13;
months following the stocking of fingerlings. Each year's production output,&#13;
marketed via fish traders at each site, would be evaluated to determine the&#13;
following year's stocking proportion.&#13;

Number of Potential Beneficiaries&#13;
5.    Approximately 1 boat (coracle) would be required per 7.5 ha of water&#13;
area in the Model A reservoirs and 1 coracle per 10 ha of Model B reservoirs&#13;
at a cost of about Rs. 1,500/coracle. This would amount to a total of 66&#13;
boats. If the boats, which usually have two occupants, are shared,&#13;
approximately 132 households could benefit. In addition, the 5.5 ha&#13;
fingerling rearing pens divided into 0.25 ha units, would provide employment&#13;
for 22 more households with each provided 1 coracle for pen management. The&#13;
total number of households that could be employed by the sub-component would&#13;
be 154 or between 25-30% of the estimated 561 PAHs. The average net income&#13;
would be about Rs. 14,000 per fishing household per year and about Rs. 2,600&#13;
per pen culture household for about 3 months labor. If it is not feasible for&#13;
2 PAHs to share 1 coracle, then the number of beneficiaries would be reduced&#13;
to 88 households. If the 2,940 ha of tanks were also developed, the number of&#13;
beneficiaries could be increased nearly 6 fold.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
6.    The implementation of the fisheries sub-component (reservoirs and pens)&#13;
would be conducted by TN Fisheries Officers deputed to the WRO. The&#13;
reservoirs, with fishing rights transferred to the WRO, would be leased for a&#13;
period of 10 years to groups of PAHs who would pay an annual lease fee. -The&#13;
annual lease fees should be set high enough to cover government management&#13;
costs, including (a) those for technical extension, management, and monitoring&#13;
of the reservoirs by district DOF officers; and (b) a fee to the TN Irrigation&#13;
Department at the rate of Rs. 2.5/ha/yr for use of the reservoirs. All fees&#13;
would be collected as a fixed, comprehensive fishing licence fee paid by each&#13;
fisher that would be paid on a quarterly basis, beginning in each reservoir's&#13;
fifth year of operation. The PAH groups would be responsible for rearing and&#13;
stocking fingerlings, harvesting fish, and clearing floating vegetation from&#13;
the reservoirs. The WRO deputed Fisheries Officers would monitor overall&#13;
fisheries management including fingerling stocking, fish landings, and weed&#13;
removal.&#13;
7.    The WRO should also identify and recruit a suitable non-governmental&#13;
organization (NGO) working in the area for a period of 4 years to assist with&#13;
the identification and organization of groups of PAHs that would lease and&#13;
manage the fishery in the reservoirs. The NGO would also assist the&#13;
beneficiaries with establishing savings accounts to cover the closed fishing&#13;
season, expenditures required for fishing licence fees, replacement costs for&#13;
coracles, nets, pens, and for fingerling production costs. Fees paid for NGO&#13;
services would be derived from "NGO Support and Beneficiary Training" (Table&#13;
2) which includes Rs. 1,000/PAH/yr for the first 4 years at each reservoir.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
8.    In addition to the training provided to the beneficiaries by the&#13;
Fisheries Department and the NGO under the direction of the WRO, domestic&#13;
training (i.e. by CIFA) for the Fisheries Officers deputed to the WRO and for&#13;
local consultants from other state Fisheries Departments or private sector&#13;
enterprises in which expertize would exist for reservoir fisheries management&#13;
&#13;

and fingerling rearing. A total lump sum of Rs. 930,000 has been allocated&#13;
for this TA during the first 2 years of the sub-component.&#13;
Phasing&#13;
9.    It is anticipated fisheries activities at each reservoir would be&#13;
initiated upon completion of their construction once filled with water after&#13;
the next fish spawning season. Table 2 has been organized on the basis of all&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOTRCFS CONSOLIDATTON PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference for the Baseline Survey&#13;
1.    The objectives of the baseline survey are twofold: (i) to provide the&#13;
necessary information to assess the current situation before field implementation&#13;
of the project and (ii) to establish development performance indicators to&#13;
monitor and evaluate project success. Based on the assessment of the current&#13;
situation the baseline survey would provide simple and low cost performance&#13;
indicators to monitor project success continuously for all project areas.&#13;
Performance indicators form part of the performance review of a particular&#13;
activity to be measured against specified objectives. To gain further experience&#13;
in monitoring project success of this and other Water Resources Consolidation&#13;
Projects in India more detailed baseline surveys followed by a more detailed&#13;
monitoring program will be carried out in selected commands. The baseline survey&#13;
and the development of the performance indicators will be an interdisciplinary&#13;
product jointly produced by irrigation engineers, agricultural&#13;
scientists/economists, remote sensing specialists, and water resource managers.&#13;
2.    The following list provides guidance of possible performance indicators for&#13;
specific project activities. The necessary information for the indicators should&#13;
be obtained through the baseline survey in order to assess the current situation.&#13;
The list of indicators may not be complete, nor do all of the suggested&#13;
indicators have to be used for the monitoring process. It is essential to keep&#13;
the monitoring process as simple as possible in order to reduce the workload on&#13;
field staff.&#13;
(a)   Engineering indicators for operational performance:&#13;
i)    Actual dates of irrigation versus planned dates of irrigation;&#13;
ii)   Variations in the flow at main canal and distributary heads as a&#13;
ratio of their planned discharges;&#13;
iii) Variations in the flow at main canal and distributary tail clusters&#13;
as a ratio of their planned discharges; and&#13;
iv)   Volume of the water received at the distributary head as a ratio of&#13;
water discharged at the main canal head.&#13;
(b)   Engineering indicators for maintenance performance:&#13;
i)    Actual capacity of main canal and distributaries as a ratio of their&#13;
design capacities;&#13;
ii)   Maintenance cost per kilometer of canal/drain system maintenance&#13;
broken up in 3-4 categories of different ranges of canal sizes;&#13;
iii) Maintenance cost per hectare of command area;&#13;
iv)   Actual maintenance expenditures versus budget targets; and&#13;
v)    Actual area irrigated as a percentage of planned area.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(c)   Agricultural production indicators for performance of scheme completions,&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization investments:&#13;
i)    Area receiving full, partial and no canal water supplies as a ratio&#13;
of total command;&#13;
ii)   Production of three principal irrigated crops;&#13;
iii)  Changes of crop yields in relation to the previous year;&#13;
iv)   Changes in the cropping pattern in relation to the previous year;&#13;
v)    Changes of farm income in relation to the previous year;&#13;
vi)   Amount and value of the three principal crops as a ratio of water&#13;
deliveries; and&#13;
vii)  Amount of water received per crop (irrigation and rainfall) as a&#13;
ratio of crop water requirements.&#13;
(d)   Remote sensing to indicate performance of scheme completions,&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization investments at command level:&#13;
i)    Total area under irrigation; and&#13;
ii)   Changes in the cropping pattern.&#13;
(e)   Performance indicators for the institutional restructuring of WRO:&#13;
i)    Reorganizational benchmarks achieved;&#13;
ii)   Benchmarks of environmental action plan achieved;&#13;
iii)  Progress on basin/state water resource planning;&#13;
iv)   Programming and budgeting plans formulated and submitted on schedule;&#13;
v)    Annual training program for WRO personnel approved on schedule by&#13;
EIC; and&#13;
vi)   Number of senior engineers who received management training.&#13;
(f)   Performance indicators for farmer turnover program:&#13;
i)    Number of farmer councils at distributary level established and&#13;
participating:&#13;
a) in planning distributory works,&#13;
b) in joint management with WRO, and&#13;
c) and taking responsibility for O&amp;M;&#13;
ii)   Amount of funds collected by farmer councils for maintenance work at&#13;
distributary;&#13;
iii)  Number of farmer councils requesting and involved in stage 2&#13;
improvements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
iv)   Number of apex committees established and working; and&#13;
v)    Number of farmer councils having problems.&#13;
3.    The more detailed baseline surveys should cover 2 to 4 major schemes under&#13;
rehabilitation/modernization in stage 1 (for example Lower Bhavani, Periyar&#13;
Vaigai) and 2 to 4 schemes in stage 2 (for example Kodayar, Amaravathy, Sathanur,&#13;
Cumbum). This survey would involve field visits, a stratified farm survey and&#13;
intensive remote sensing support with field verification. For the detailed&#13;
baseline survey in these areas, WRO could be supported by appropriately&#13;
experienced universities and/or research institutions; for example Tamil Nadu&#13;
Agricultural University, the remote sensing center at Anna University, and other&#13;
Tamil Nadu, India or overseas institutions.&#13;

Page 2 of 9&#13;
5.    The investment program would be supported by a number of policy and&#13;
institutional reforms including: actions consistent with the objectives under&#13;
the recently formulated "Tamil Nadu State Water Policy"; the creation and&#13;
strengthening of the state "Water Resources Organization"; implementation of&#13;
an Environmental Action Plan; prioritization of state expenditures in the&#13;
irrigation sector emphasizing maintenance and institutional strengthening as&#13;
first priority, followed by the system improvement and farmer turnover&#13;
program, followed by viable scheme completions, and last (and only as needed&#13;
within Tamil Nadu's state water planning requirements, particularly for&#13;
metropolitan needs), viable new investment; full programming and funding of&#13;
maintenance; measures to rationalize water charges, review cost recovery&#13;
annually and hand-over O&amp;M responsibilities and funding of distributaries to&#13;
established farmer councils; measures to introduce groundwater legislation and&#13;
regulatory actions for groundwater pumping; and establishment of an&#13;
institutional apparatus, improved procedures and implementation of individual&#13;
land acquisition and economic rehabilitation action plans for persons affected&#13;
under the project (Refer chapter II of main report and relevant Annexes).&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
6.    Project Management and Implementation.  The project would be implemented&#13;
by Tamil Nadu's Water Resources Organization (WRO). Project management would&#13;
be under the responsibility of the Engineer-in-Chief, WRO, under the overall&#13;
guidance of the Secretary, WRO (PWD). The EIC would have overall&#13;
responsibility for implementation and coordination of all activities,&#13;
supported by CEs responsible for their respective management units: CE Plan&#13;
Formulation, CE Design, Research and Construction, CE O&amp;M, CE State Water&#13;
Resources and Data Center, CE IWS and CE IMTI, plus, for field management, the&#13;
four CE Basin Managers. The EIC's office would be supported by a joint CE,&#13;
units for Administration, Program and Budgeting, Monitoring and Evaluation,&#13;
and Project Officers for special assignments. WRO would also contain a&#13;
Regulatory Directorate and a Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation&#13;
Office. Environmental cells would be in IWS and with the CE Plan Formulation,&#13;
plus smaller environmental units at basin manager level. The institutional&#13;
structure. orcaaniarams and position descriptions are at Annex 2.&#13;
Implementation responsibilities are at Attachment 2 of this Annex.&#13;
7.    For water planning (refer Annex 3) the Water Resources Control and&#13;
Review Council (WRCRC), chaired by the Chief Minister and with Ministers PWD&#13;
(WRO), Municipal Administration and Rural Development as Vice Chairmen, and&#13;
including representation from all Government Departments associated with water&#13;
use and quality, would be the highest state body for coordinating basin and&#13;
state water planning and allocation across sectors. The IWS would be the&#13;
Secretariat of the WRCRC and Nodal Agency for state water planning. For&#13;
coordination of the Environmental Action Plan (refer Annex 7), the WRCRC would&#13;
contain an Environmental Sub-Committee. Specific management and implementation&#13;
details for the System Imnrovement and Farmer Turnover proaram are at Annex 4.&#13;
The institutional and management arrangements for the Land Acauisition and&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation program are at Annex 9. Management arrangements for&#13;
the Water Resources Research Fund are at Annex 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
8.    Training and Technical Assistance.  The extensive reorganization and&#13;
institutional strengthening to be undertaken under the project, and the major&#13;
initiatives in the areas of water planning, farmer participation and turnover,&#13;
systems improvement, environmental management and business skills such as&#13;
management information systems and programming and budgeting, would require&#13;
substantial training and technical assistance throughout the WRO. Training&#13;
and consultancy needs have been prepared by WRO and the Bank for each&#13;
management unit and are detailed in their respective cost tables at Annex 11.&#13;
Each CE would be responsible for managing the specific training and&#13;
consultancy relevant to his management unit, but would receive administrative&#13;
support from a Training and Technical Assistance Officer in the EIC's office.&#13;
Overall coordination and identification of training opportunities would be&#13;
provided by the CE, IMTI. The EIC would provide general guidance and balance&#13;
needs between WRO units. Training would focus on strengthening skills in all&#13;
engineering areas including operations and maintenance, water planning,&#13;
environmental management, design and construction, and supporting skill&#13;
development associated with technologies or management techniques relatively&#13;
new to WRO such as financial management skills, programming and budgeting,&#13;
computerization, computer aided design, remote sensing and management&#13;
information systems. For consultancies, in order that know-how is transferred&#13;
to WRO staff, consultant assistance would be linked in all cases to staff&#13;
training through association of staff with consultant assignments and&#13;
interlinked formal training as practicable. National and international study&#13;
tours, training courses and temporary assignments with experienced water&#13;
agencies would also be used to provide first-hand exposure to new technologies&#13;
and management techniques.&#13;
9.    Consultancy arrangements would include small consultancies with&#13;
individuals or firms as needed, but would be backstopped throughout the&#13;
project period with one main consultancy contract comprising a "twinning&#13;
arrangement" with an experienced consultancy group. All consultancy selection&#13;
would follow Bank guidelines. The twinning arrangement would be with a&#13;
consortium of several firms or specialist institutions, likely including one&#13;
international firm and one domestic firm, plus other firms/institutes as may&#13;
be considered appropriate in the offers by consortia and as may be accepted in&#13;
final selection of the most qualified offer. The central skill areas for an&#13;
acceptable consortium, seldom found in one firm or agency, would comprise all&#13;
aspects of irrigation engineering, water planning and modelling, environmental&#13;
management, and hands-on irrigation management, particularly in O&amp;M, general&#13;
and corporate management techniques, and beneficiary participation, plus&#13;
capacity to provide or arrange training in all of the above areas. One of the&#13;
firms or agencies of the consortium would be the lead partner and have overall&#13;
responsibility for mobilizing the consultancy and training support required.&#13;
The contract would provide a basic expertise and training input annually,&#13;
including some core senior staff providing continuity of visits, and access to&#13;
other specializations and training on an "as needed" basis, with flexibility&#13;
retained and provided for in the consultancy budget of the contract.&#13;
Selection would be through an initial invitation and subsequent&#13;
prequalification of interested firms (in their prequalification offers the&#13;
firms would advise of any intended partners), followed by short listing by WRO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 218 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
of about 4 (range 3 to 5) firms or groups of firms for submission of detailed&#13;
offers. A contract over the full project period would be agreed at the outset,&#13;
with flexibility for annual variations based on an annual review of&#13;
consultancy and related training needs between WRO and the consortium in&#13;
consultation with GOTN's Department of Finance and IDA. The above procedures&#13;
would provide the expertise required while limiting constraints frequently&#13;
found in India of obtaining individual clearances, especially for consultants&#13;
and training requiring foreign exchange. Consultancy needs are contained in&#13;
the detailed project cost tables by project component and WRO management units&#13;
at Annex 11.&#13;
10.   Additional to the above, WRO would: (i) contract a senior institutional&#13;
advisor, institutional advisors and community organizers (NGOs) for the farmer&#13;
participation and turnover program (already under implementation) (Annex 4);&#13;
(ii) continue to hire the services of a national firm with expertise in land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation for assisting the LAERO with the land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation program over at least the first three&#13;
years of the project; (iii) contract NGOs for implementation of the LAERAPs&#13;
and administration of the associated RGF and AMG asset creation funds (Annex&#13;
9); (iv) contract a national fisheries specialist to advise on the fisheries&#13;
component of the LAER program (Annex 9); contract a supervision consultancy&#13;
contract to assist WRO and GOTN's "Supervision Committee" (para 17); (v) under&#13;
advice of the Research Advisory Committee, contract Tamil Nadu, other Indian&#13;
and overseas research institutes for the research and technology transfer&#13;
program under the project's Water Resources Research Fund (Annex 8), and (vi)&#13;
contract for other needs as may be determined by WRO and IDA during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
11.   Staff Continuity and Specialization. WRO will ensure organizational and&#13;
functional effectiveness by establishing various categories of specialists.&#13;
These specialists will represent the broad range of responsibilities of WRO&#13;
from design to maintenance to programming and budget. Specialists will be&#13;
selected and provided additional training, either by IMTI or by outside&#13;
training institutes or consultants. Study tours will also be arranged where&#13;
appropriate to further enhance the expertise and awareness of technologies and&#13;
management skills of the specialists. Consistent with the expenditure of time&#13;
and funding to provide specialized training, posting policies will be modified&#13;
to take advantage of this additional training by retaining these employees in&#13;
their specialized disciplines. In many cases, transfers can still be&#13;
accommodated but should be within the same discipline. In other cases the&#13;
specialization is so specific and limited that few if more than one location&#13;
will be able to utilize that speciality. For example, an earth dam designer&#13;
can only be usefully posted with the Chief Engineer, Design, Research and&#13;
Construction. In such instances the posting policy will allow an extended&#13;
stay in the same location, with due consideration to the preferences of the&#13;
employee. Promotions would actively favor employees staying in a post for more&#13;
than three years and employees staying in a particular speciality.&#13;
12.   Implementation Schedule.   A Summary Implementation Schedule for the&#13;
project is at Attachment 1. Details by project component are in their&#13;
respective annexes.&#13;

13.  Costs. Financing and Disbursements.  Detailed oroject costs by component&#13;
and year are at Annex 11 and summarized in Chapter III of the main report. The&#13;
financing olan is at para 3.04. Disbursement arrangements are described at&#13;
para 3.13 and a Disbursement Schedule is at Annex 12. Arrangements for&#13;
retroactive financing, the special account and accounting and auditing are at&#13;
paras 3.15 and 3.16.&#13;
14.   Procurement Implementation and Schedule. Procurement arrangements are&#13;
described at paras 3.05 to 3.12 of the main report. They include special&#13;
management features (para 3.11) to ensure efficient and timely procurement.&#13;
Detailed procurement schedules with contract packages, timing and estimated&#13;
costs have been prepared for all field sites/components. An example of such a&#13;
schedule is at Attachment 5 of this Annex.&#13;
15.   Economic Analysis.  The detailed economic analysis for the project is at&#13;
Annex 14 and summarized with risk assessments and description of non-&#13;
quantifiable benefits in chapter 5 of the main report. The overall economic&#13;
rate of return for the project is estimated at 17%. Sensitivity tests and&#13;
risks analysis are in Annex 14.&#13;
C. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
16.   Management and Supervision Tools.  A project of this nature requires&#13;
close management, monitoring and supervision for its success. Sustainable&#13;
success depends on creating a management and monitoring structure and&#13;
capability integral to the entirety of WRO's operations and continuous after&#13;
the duration of the WRCP. For this reason, management information systems&#13;
(MIS), monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) capability, programming and budgeting&#13;
(P&amp;B), use of development indicators including the results of a baseline&#13;
survey, and a system of quarterly reports and a closely followed Annual&#13;
Review, Action Plan and Budget, supplemented by special reports on certain&#13;
components and a mid-term review, have been integrated in project management.&#13;
These will form the basic tools for management, supervision and actions to&#13;
redress problem areas and exploit evolving opportunities for faster or&#13;
modified implementation. They will in themselves significantly raise the&#13;
management capabilities of WRO, which were constrained within the former PWD&#13;
due to lack of basic management tools. PWD did not have, or had only in very&#13;
limited form, capabilities in MIS, M&amp;E and P&amp;B. As important in terms of&#13;
limiting the facility of management, PWD's organizational structure was overly&#13;
centralized with inadequate delegation of authority. Further, management&#13;
units were only partially organized around functional specializations limiting&#13;
staff specialization which was further exacerbated by frequent staff&#13;
transfers. The new organization (Annex 2) around functional specialties,&#13;
divested of non-water related activities, and with decentralized control&#13;
nearer to field sites, will - once fully established - greatly improve the&#13;
task of management. It will enable WRO's evolution, associated with intensive&#13;
training and consultancy assistance, to a modern water agency. The management&#13;
tools above are described in the paragraphs below and relevant sections of the&#13;
main report and its annexes.&#13;

17.   GOTN and GOI Supervision. In view of the institutional and technical&#13;
challenges to be undertaken under the project, GOTN will implement special&#13;
measures to provide additional supervision support from government. A WRCP&#13;
Supervision Committee has been formed by GOTN chaired by the Secretary WRO&#13;
with the Secretary, Finance Department as Vice Chairman and EIC, WRO as&#13;
Secretary and including the Member (Irrigation) of the state Planning&#13;
Commission, Land Development Commissioner, plus two experienced invited&#13;
members (former WRO, other government department or business community/NGO&#13;
with proven management ability). In central government, MOWR, DEA, Advisor&#13;
(Irrigation) Planning Commission (and other ministries such as environment&#13;
where issues addressed are relevant) will also be copied minutes and have&#13;
standing invitations to attend as possible. As relevant for particular&#13;
issues, other GOITN representatives will be invited to participate (eg&#13;
Agriculture Department, AED, Environment, District Collectors). Meetings will&#13;
be at least quarterly to discuss the quarterly reports and the ARAPB, and more&#13;
often as needed. Additionally, a Supervision Consultancy will be arranged and&#13;
funded under the WRCP with a national consultancy firm. This would provide&#13;
backstopping consultancy assistance to the WRCP Supervision Committee and site&#13;
visits. The consultants would make two visits per year, timed to overlap with&#13;
IDA supervision missions, and additional assistance as needed. Consultant&#13;
reports would be made to the committee and copied to IDA and GOI.&#13;
18.   IDA Supervision. An indicative IDA Supervision Schedule is at Attachment&#13;
3, and would be adjusted as needed during project implementation. The overall&#13;
plan comprises in a typical year two formal visits, supplemented by&#13;
correspondence, clearances and visits of WRO staff to the Delhi office as&#13;
needed. One of the visits would be short and primarily of an expediting&#13;
nature: checking progress, helping resolve interim constraints, dealing with&#13;
consultancy, procurement, disbursement and accounting matters arising. One&#13;
main mission a year would be timed to coincide with the review of the draft&#13;
ARAPB in the December/January period and would make selective visits to the&#13;
field, go through all aspects of the project and help determine the&#13;
forthcoming year's program and review the program budget. GOTN's&#13;
"Supervision" consultants (para 17) would, inter alia, include in their&#13;
program missions of their consultants at the same time as both the IDA visits.&#13;
Visits of the core staff of the main consultancy contract would also be timed&#13;
where possible to overlap with the IDA missions, and as needed, similar&#13;
arrangements would be made for specialists, especially where decisions are&#13;
required on particular aspects of the project. Special meetings of GOTN's&#13;
"supervision Committee" (para 17) would be convened by GOTN at the time of the&#13;
IDA visits for discussion with IDA staff. These arrangements would enable&#13;
harnessing of the required specializations to enable effective multi-&#13;
disciplinary supervision and close interaction between WRO and its&#13;
consultants, GOTN and IDA, while keeping IDA resource requirements within&#13;
reasonable dimensions. The IDA Supervision Plan at Attachment 3 also allows&#13;
for: (i) more intensive supervision at project start-up, including in&#13;
procurement and disbursement, institutional reorganization, for the systems&#13;
improvement and farmer turnover program, for the LAER program and for basin&#13;
planning; (ii) the interim review of the farmer turnover program in PY2; and&#13;
(iii) the mid-term review in PY 3.&#13;

19.   Monitoring. Evaluation. Programming and BudQeting.  With the emphasis of&#13;
WRO on improving overall management of water resources in Tamil Nadu, there is&#13;
a need to consolidate and report the activities of WRO in a format which will&#13;
assist the EIC and the Government in assessing program progress and&#13;
performance, and for programming and budgeting to maximize effectiveness.&#13;
There will be two staff units, reporting directly to the EIC: the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Unit, and the Program Budgeting and Accounting Unit.&#13;
Consultancy assistance will be used to guide the establishment and initial&#13;
operation of both units, and as needed thereafter.&#13;
20.   Monitoring and Evaluation.  The new Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Unit&#13;
is an independent entity which will: (i) monitor expenditures on programs&#13;
relative to total estimated costs; (ii) conduct post-project evaluations to&#13;
compare benefits with original planning estimates; and (iii) perform&#13;
evaluations of organizational effectiveness and performance of units within&#13;
WRO for compliance with the goals and objectives of WRO. The M&amp;E Unit would&#13;
utilize the program budgeting process for much of its data to evaluate&#13;
progress of projects and programs. At the request of any organizational unit&#13;
or as directed by the EIC, the M&amp;E unit would collect data, conduct site&#13;
visits, initiate discussions with water users and the public, and evaluate&#13;
reports to determine any deficiencies or problems and provide a report to the&#13;
requestor with recommendations for action.&#13;
21.   The Monitoring and Evaluation unit will also monitor and evaluate&#13;
development effects on crop yields, total crop production, crop&#13;
diversification, farm income levels, water distribution efficiencies and&#13;
project affected persons. The current situation will be assessed based on&#13;
personal visits, discussions with water users, sample surveys, questionnaires,&#13;
and review of official publications. The evaluation will determine these&#13;
effects by comparing the situation of a given time with the Baseline Survey&#13;
(Annex 10). Annual reports will be prepared for dissemination to the State,&#13;
Government of India, the World Bank, universities and others. Also, the unit&#13;
will assess the effectiveness of the Farmer Organization and turnover Program&#13;
and its impact on water delivery efficiencies and other factors. The unit&#13;
will utilize the services of consultants or local or other universities for&#13;
special surveys and analyses, as appropriate. The development effects could&#13;
be used in the future to assist the Government in setting agricultural&#13;
production targets by matching crop water demands with available water&#13;
supplies by region or command.&#13;
22.   Program. Budgeting and Accounting.  WRO's new Program Budgeting and&#13;
Accounting Unit (PBA) will establish, maintain, and administer the program&#13;
budget and accounting system. The system will be used to develop annual&#13;
budgets by consolidating budget requests from all WRO organizational elements&#13;
and ensure that the final budget request is consistent with the policies and&#13;
instructions from the Government. The system will provide the mechanism for&#13;
tracking program progress and to assist the EIC in making recommendations on&#13;
transfer of funds from one program to another. the unit will provide periodic&#13;
management reports for use by the EIC, CEs and other managers for decision-&#13;
making purposes. In addition and to support all activities in WRO, the unit&#13;
will develop and maintain a Management Information System (MIS).&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
23.   Development Indicators.  Development Indicators (Attachment 4)&#13;
corresponding to the project objectives at para 3 have been chosen to help&#13;
track the project's impact on the project objectives. Attachment 4 provides a&#13;
matrix of monitorable indicators against each project objective and comments&#13;
on how such indicators may be monitored. Indicators include physical&#13;
indicators for the field components and qualitative and progress indicators&#13;
for other components. The indicators include: implementation of the&#13;
institutional restructuring and strengthening and its effectiveness,&#13;
agricultural growth, productivity and crop diversification, increased delivery&#13;
of water and improved services, implementation and effectiveness of the farmer&#13;
participation and turnover program, and improved planning, programming and&#13;
budgeting.&#13;
24.   Baseline Survey.  To provide a basis for monitoring the development&#13;
impact of the project, and further refining the development indicators above,&#13;
a baseline survey to be conducted by consultants would be carried out in 1995&#13;
(TOR for the Baseline Survey is at Annex 10). The survey would comprise an&#13;
overall survey supplemented by more detailed surveys at the level of sample&#13;
commands, and remote sensing for assessment of effective irrigation coverage&#13;
and cropping patterns, and would cover the following aspects: engineering&#13;
indicators for operational and maintenance performance; agricultural&#13;
production indicators; performance indicators for the institutional&#13;
restructuring and strengthening; and indicators for the farmer participation&#13;
and turnover program.&#13;
25.   Ouarterly Revorts.  The quarterly reports would be issued within two&#13;
weeks of the end of each quarter and would be issued by the Programming and&#13;
Budget unit after clearance from the EIC. Each quarterly report would contain&#13;
a listing of standard tracking data on physical progress, financing,&#13;
procurement and disbursement, a sub-set of relevant qualitative data from the&#13;
baseline survey determined parameters, brief submissions from each&#13;
implementation unit in WRO which would quantify and compare progress with the&#13;
SAR and the previous ARAPB and highlight problems, constraints and recommended&#13;
solutions, and an overview section from the EIC's office summarizing decisions&#13;
or recommendations based on the overview and each management unit's&#13;
submission. This would include commentary on status of decisions/actions&#13;
outstanding from the last quarterly report and review of any decisions/actions&#13;
still required related to recommendations of the GOTN Supervision Committee,&#13;
GOI or IDA. The reports would be presented to the Secretary WRO, and copied&#13;
to the Minister, Supervision Committee and relevant state officials, GOI and&#13;
IDA. Proforma guidance for the report is in the project file, with a single&#13;
component example at Attachment 6. The Supervision Committee would meet to&#13;
discuss and act/advise after each quarterly report, and IDA would provide&#13;
advice by written or mission communication.&#13;
26.   Annual Review. Action Plan and Budaet (ARAPB).  The ARAPB would be the&#13;
main vehicle for annually taking stock of project performance and future&#13;
needs, for adjusting WRO's program as needed, for budgeting by GOTN of WRO's&#13;
Plan and Non-Plan expenditures, and for annual major review and supervision by&#13;
GOTN, GOI and IDA. For WRO it would provide annual opportunity to assess its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
program, to propose adjustments as needed, and to make its consolidated plan&#13;
and justification for financing needs for the forthcoming year.  The ARAPB&#13;
would review for each _omponent and responsible unit the past year's&#13;
achievements in terms of development indicators, physical targets and&#13;
expenditures, and propose a justified work program and yroposed expenditure&#13;
budaet for the forthcoming fiscal year. It would also include: (i)&#13;
description of each year's works, schedule of activities, staffing&#13;
requirements and distribution of responsibilities; (ii) proposed next year&#13;
expenditures compared witlh previous full year's expenditures and budgeted and&#13;
expected expenditures in current year; (iii) details on major civil works&#13;
contracts exceeding US$ 200,000 and for ICB for goods; and (iv) financing plan&#13;
and sources of funds. Special sectioons would cover: (v) review of&#13;
implementation progress related to the institutional strengthening and policy&#13;
reforms under the project; (vi) detailed review and proposal of maintenance&#13;
needs (command-by-command) and corresponding non-Plan expenditure&#13;
requirements; (vii) the farmer participation and turnover program; and (viii)&#13;
progress of state water planning under WRCRC and IWS.&#13;
27.   Interim Review of Farmer Organization and Turnover Program.  Due to the&#13;
importance and innovatory nature of the Systems Improvement and Farmer&#13;
Turnover program, in particular the farmer participation and turnover aspects,&#13;
a Special Evaluation would he carried oUt of this program in PY2 (FY 1996/97)&#13;
by consultants with expertise in this area. This would enable feedback and&#13;
recommendations sufficiently early in project implementation to enable timely&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
28.   Mid-Term Review.  By December 31, 1997 (mid "PY3"), GOTN/WRO would carry&#13;
out, jointly with IDA and (G,OT, a Mid-Term Review of project progress and&#13;
possible need for adjustments to components, implementation arrangements and&#13;
policy reforms, and thereafter implement its recommendations.&#13;
29.   Implementation CompLetion Reoort   An Implementation Completion Report&#13;
would be prepared by GOTN orn the basis of IDA's guidelines, not later than six&#13;
months from the closing date of the Credit.&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLTDATION PRO.TECT&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    OveXview:  The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project would&#13;
assist Tamil Nadu State to significantly refocus its program in the water and&#13;
irrigation sector. The State's water resources agency would be modernized, and&#13;
complemented with supporting policy and institutional mechanisms to plan and&#13;
manage water from a multi-sectoral and environmentally-responsive perspective.&#13;
The project would introduce mechanisms for private sector participation in water&#13;
management activities, including the turnover of irrigation facility operations&#13;
and maintenance to farmer organizations. Irrigation sector expenditure&#13;
priorities would be revised to ensure first priority to full funding of&#13;
maintenance activities, second priority to rehabilitation and modernization of&#13;
existing irrigation schemes, and third priority to completion of existing&#13;
schemes. In addition, the project introduces to the water resources agency the&#13;
use of rigorous criteria for future project selection. These actions together&#13;
would serve to improve the productivity and sustainability of irrigation services&#13;
and ensure the timely provision of water to all user.&#13;
2.    Besides the irrigation benefits, the project would also generate long-term&#13;
benefits which are more difficult to quantify. Transforming the irrigation&#13;
branch of the Public Works Department (PWD) from a construction-oriented agency&#13;
into a specialized Water Resource Organization (WRO) would improve the management&#13;
of the State's water resources to include a multi-sector and environmentally-&#13;
sustainable perspective. Groundwater protection would be enhanced by improving&#13;
groundwater monitoring, regulations and enforcement. Allocation of water&#13;
resources between agricultural and non-agricultural users would be improved&#13;
through more holistic water planning. Bulk water supplies for industrial and&#13;
domestic users would be assured by multi-use basin and state water planning&#13;
wherein they would enjoy high priority. Revision of irrigation sector&#13;
expenditure priorities, in addition to improved project selection criteria, would&#13;
yield efficiency gains for the State, allowing it to avoid costly and unnecessary&#13;
projects and to invest in the most effective projects upfront. Lack of&#13;
quantitative data prevents the explicit incorporation of these benefits in the&#13;
analysis, but their significance is large.&#13;
Analysis and Methodologfy&#13;
3.    The analysis concentrates on quantifying the impact of project activities&#13;
on irrigation and agricultural production. The non-quantifiable benefits will be&#13;
described briefly though they will not figure into the determination of project&#13;
viability. In concert with the project's structure which is comprised of two&#13;
main components, the analysis is divided into two parts: first, the economic&#13;
analysis for the scheme completions, then a separate analysis for the&#13;
modernization and rehabilitation component of the project. This division is&#13;
chosen because it provides better opportunities for monitoring project progress&#13;
after implementation.&#13;
4.    Water is a scarce good in Tamil Nadu.  Domestic and industrial users&#13;
compete with agriculture for water resources and demand will continue to&#13;
increase. Project activities would increase the surface water supply&#13;
availability for all sectors. Currently more than 90% of the surface water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 240 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
supplies are used in the agriculture sector, so most of the increases in surface&#13;
water supplies through project activities are likely to be added to irrigation&#13;
and rural water supply. The economic benefits of increasing surface water&#13;
supplies through project activities could theoretically be calculated by using&#13;
bulk water prices for industrial, domestic, or agricultural use. The current&#13;
water rates in Tamil Nadu (industry Rs. 500/'000m3 , domestic Rs. 200/'000m3,&#13;
agriculture Rs. 14-26/'000m3) belong to the highest in India.  However, these&#13;
prices are more an indication of political will than actual efficiency prices for&#13;
bulk water and can therefore not be used for the analysis. To cautiously value&#13;
the benefits of the project, the increase in surface water supplies is evaluated&#13;
in terms of the marginal benefits of water supplied to irrigation which is&#13;
generally the least attractive alternative.&#13;
5.    Economic import and export parity prices are calculated based on the World&#13;
Bank Revision of Primary Commodity Price Forecasts, July 1994 (Table 1) using&#13;
year 2000 projections expressed in constant March 1994 prices. Export parity&#13;
prices are used for cotton and sugarcane, import parity prices calculated for&#13;
paddy and for fertilizer. Rice is treated as an import substitute as Indian&#13;
demand and supply analysis for rice indicates the need for substantial expansion&#13;
of domestic production to avoid imports. Although India is essentially&#13;
self-sufficient in rice production, there will be a need to increase paddy&#13;
productivity in order to keep pace with population growth and positive income&#13;
effects due to economic growth. Sugar and cotton are valued at export parity&#13;
prices. Groundnuts and coconuts are treated as non-tradeable since they are&#13;
consumed as fresh products, and do not compare with internationally traded copra&#13;
or vegetable oil commodities. The project's incremental production of these&#13;
crops is fairly small and would be absorbable in the local fresh market. The&#13;
financial prices, adjusted with a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9, are&#13;
comparable to export parity prices for copra and slightly higher for groundnut&#13;
oil. All non-internationally-traded products have been adjusted with the&#13;
standard conversion factor (SCF) for India of 0.9. The economic prices for&#13;
seeds, labor, draught power, and machinery are based on financial prices, net of&#13;
taxes, adjusted by the SCF.&#13;
Scheme Completions&#13;
6.    This component involves the construction works required to complete&#13;
irrigation schemes which are currently being undertaken. From an earlier list of&#13;
twenty candidate sub-projects, thirteen candidates were selected for detailed&#13;
analysis during project preparation on the basis of preliminary screening,&#13;
including assessment of water availability within Tamil Nadu's overall water&#13;
planning and development objectives, and assessment of likely economic viability.&#13;
Of the thirteen schemes, five have construction activities at a fairly advanced&#13;
stage. Construction on the remaining eight candidates is either in the early&#13;
stages or proposed to start, with land acquisition and tender procedures under&#13;
preparation. On the basis of the analysis below, nine of the thirteen candidates&#13;
have been selected for inclusion in the WRO's work program over the WRCP period.&#13;
7.    While worldwide and Indian experience suggests that new irrigation schemes&#13;
typically have low economic rates of return, higher rates of return can generally&#13;
be expected from investments to complete the substantial backlog of on-going&#13;
irrigation projects. However, ERRs above the opportunity cost of capital, even&#13;
for scheme completions, are by no means automatic and the selection of candidates&#13;
for finance has to be done rigorously based on economic, technical and social&#13;
criteria.&#13;

8.    Benefits  The Scheme Completions component has the direct objective of&#13;
increasing the quantity of, and improving the reliability of water supplies for&#13;
agricultural and domestic purposes. The direct benefits which would accrue as a&#13;
result of the investments are as follows:&#13;
1. Increases in irrigated command areas;&#13;
2. Improved yields resulting purely from reduction in moisture stress;&#13;
3. Improved yields resulting from optimum input practices adopted by&#13;
farmers in the light of improved reliability of water supply;&#13;
4. Agricultural intensification and changes in cropping patterns to higher&#13;
value crops; and&#13;
5. Provision of domestic water supplies.&#13;
9.    For each of the thirteen scheme completions appraised, the direct&#13;
agricultural benefits have been quantified in detail and form the basis of the&#13;
economic evaluation of the sub-component. However, secondary economic benefits&#13;
(and costs) which could be available, but have not been valued and included in&#13;
the analysis, would include:&#13;
1. Future options for bulk water supply to municipal and industrial users;&#13;
2. The net value of any fish production resulting from building&#13;
reservoirs;&#13;
3. Improved drinking water supplies caused through groundwater recharge;&#13;
4. Any flood control due to the construction of civil works;&#13;
5. The byproduct values associated with the various crops to be grown;&#13;
and&#13;
6. Social forestry schemes, and thus fuelwood output, planted in new&#13;
tanks.&#13;
10.   Crop budgets in economic terms have been derived from the financial crop&#13;
budget and are set out in Table 2. These data were compiled from joint WRO and&#13;
FAO/CP field visits to each scheme area. The value of the electricity consumed&#13;
in supplementary irrigation from wells is extremely difficult to quantify because&#13;
disaggregated records of power consumption are not available, and the use of well&#13;
irrigation can vary significantly dependent on seasonal climatic conditions.&#13;
Supplementary well irrigation would be reduced as a result of the project because&#13;
groundwater and associated power consumption would be partly substituted by the&#13;
increased and more reliable surface water supplies. For the purposes of the&#13;
analysis, however, it is assumed that power consumption would not change with the&#13;
project.&#13;
11.   The investment costs in the economic analysis are derived from the detailed&#13;
cost tables, adjusted to economic costs, and include physical contingencies.&#13;
Annual operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs have been estimated at Rs. 298/ha&#13;
subsequently adjusted by the SCF, and applied from 1 April, 1994 onwards. This is&#13;
based on a detailed estimate of requirement for full maintenance provided by WRO&#13;
and reviewed during appraisal. These costs include current costs of staff.&#13;

12.   Methodology  For each of the thirteen scheme completions, the economic rate&#13;
of return was calculated to ascertain the economic viability of the scheme, and&#13;
assess the merits for its financing. The economic rate of return calculation&#13;
(ERR) is based on the following assumptions: (i) all costs are in constant March&#13;
1994 prices; (ii) project benefits and costs are calculated for 30 years; (iii)&#13;
quantifiable net returns are from incremental crop production; (iv) O&amp;M&#13;
expenditures would remain constant over 30 years; and (v) the opportunity cost&#13;
of capital is 12%. Thus, schemes are automatically included for financing if the&#13;
ERR is at least 12%.&#13;
13.   In order to estimate the incremental benefit and cost streams for each&#13;
scheme, the irrigated areas were divided into areas defined by the source of&#13;
irrigation water, which is set out graphically in Table 3. The future situation&#13;
without the project is assumed to approximate the present situation without the&#13;
project. For ongoing schemes, it has been assumed that all costs incurred before&#13;
1 April, 1994, will be treated as sunk.&#13;
14.   In the base case scenario, scheme completions have been costed using&#13;
standard Government construction rates, increased by 50%. The analysis also&#13;
presents results using Government rates increased by 25%, and Government rates&#13;
only. The use of Government rates plus 50% is based on analysis of actual past&#13;
and present implementation experience, compared with unit rates quoted by the&#13;
Government. This base case has been adopted for both the ERR analysis and&#13;
project costing, given the importance of the economic success of each completion&#13;
scheme in the overall program and adequate funding based on implementation&#13;
experience. The costs further include physical contingencies of 10% for all&#13;
civil works and vehicles, and 15% for all equipment. The approach taken during&#13;
appraisal was to incorporate sufficient safeguards in the analysis and selection&#13;
process of completion schemes to ensure as far as possible the economic viability&#13;
of each scheme.&#13;
15. Results. The table below gives a summary of the economic rates of return&#13;
and benefit/cost ratios for the thirteen candidate completion schemes, including&#13;
sensitivity analysis for cost overruns. For details refer to Table 4. The&#13;
results indicate that eight of the scheme completions, Adavinainarkoil,&#13;
Gridhammal II, Kodumudiyar, Mordhana, Nambiyar, Poigayar, Rajathopekanar, and&#13;
Vadakku Pachayar, are acceptable investment projects in economic terms since they&#13;
would be expected to provide economic rates of return at or in excess of the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital (OCC) for India of 12% p.a. Four schemes (shown at&#13;
bottom of the table) are not viable and have been excluded from the project.&#13;
16.   One scheme, Sothuparai, has an ERR of 11.2%, and under normal circumstances&#13;
would not be considered for financing. A calculation of the switching value for&#13;
benefits, however, indicates that benefits for Sothuparai would have to increase&#13;
by only 6.5% for the ERR to be equal to 12%. This is equivalent to an additional&#13;
NPV of Rs. 16 million (US$0.5 million), or Rs. 2 million (US$60,000) per year.&#13;
The NPV of additional benefits amounts to an average of Rs. 9900/ha (US$300/ha),&#13;
or Rs. 1200/ha per year (US$37/ha per year). These additional benefits would&#13;
likely be achieved through the secondary benefits that would accrue as a result&#13;
of the project, such as byproduct values from additional crop production (e.g.&#13;
increased straw biomass for fodder), health benefits from improved drinking&#13;
water, and new fisheries production. For example, it is estimated that net&#13;
income from fisheries alone would be Rs. 14,000 (US$440) per fishing household&#13;
per year (Annex 9, Attachment 5), which amounts to an estimated Rs. 1 million&#13;

Notes:&#13;
1/ Base case: Economic parameters as at October 1994 - updated SCF for India (May 1994),&#13;
updated commodity prices (July 1994);  Project costs based on Government rates plus 50%,&#13;
plus physical contingencies.&#13;
2/ Case 2: Project costs based on Government rates plus 25%, plus physical contingencies.&#13;
3/ Case 3: Project costs based on Government rates only, plus physical contingencies.&#13;
4/ The benefit/cost ratio is included here since it has been in the past the basis on which&#13;
WRO (formerly the Public Works Department) evaluated its projects.  Projects were&#13;
considered acceptable by PWD if the ratio was greater than 1.5 (or 1 if the project&#13;
was located in drought-prone areas). It is calculated as a ratio of annual benefits to&#13;
annualized investment plus operating costs using base case cost assumptions: i.e.&#13;
(Net benefit at full capacity)/((10% of total investment costs) + (2% depreciation) + O&amp;M).&#13;
17.   The analysis shows the benefits of careful control of construction costs.&#13;
Of the nine schemes above, six (Adavinainarkoil, Nambiyar, Poigayar,&#13;
Rajathopekanar, Sothuparai and Vadakku Pachayar) have economic rates of return at&#13;
or near the 12% level. The economic rate of return of each of these six schemes&#13;
would move to the 15-16% range if construction costs equal to Government rates&#13;
plus 25% were achieved (case 2). In order to avoid realization of low economic&#13;
rates of return, the project's procurement and contractor supervision and&#13;
monitoring arrangements are specifically designed to achieve maximum economies in&#13;
construction costs.&#13;
18.   As indicated above, four of the schemes reviewed, Shanmughanadhi, Periyar&#13;
Vaigai Tirrupattur, Periyar Vaigai Maravangamalam and Irrukangudi, are not&#13;
acceptable in economic terms based on present design, cost, water availability&#13;
and resulting cropping pattern. Each of these four would provide economic&#13;
returns significantly less than the required 12% OCC. Therefore, only the nine&#13;
schemes mentioned previously will be included in WRO's program for support by the&#13;
project. The nine scheme completions together have an overall economic rate of&#13;
return of 15% and a net present value of Rs. 338 million. The major benefits are&#13;
an incremental production of 4,700 t of paddy, 5,500 t of groundnut and an&#13;
additional 76,000 t of sugarcane (Table 5).&#13;
19.   The State's program in the water sector, which is financed under the WRCP,&#13;
will include detailed water planning for future water needs. When the basin and&#13;
state water plans are developed, it is likely that new projects would be&#13;
1This estimate is consistent with the assumption of Annex 9, Attachment&#13;
5, i.e. that 30% of the 170 affected households at the Sothuparai scheme site&#13;
reap the benefits from new fishery activities.&#13;

identified by WRO in the course of the next years, in particular in relation to&#13;
estimated urban and industrial bulk water needs. To enable the WRCP to&#13;
accommodate the inclusion of further completion schemes under the overall&#13;
investment program of WRO, a small provision (at 10% of base costs of the nine&#13;
accepted scheme completions) would be made in the project costs for the&#13;
construction and completion of presently unidentified schemes. The inclusion of&#13;
any further projects would be dependent on completing and satisfying a set of&#13;
rigorous criteria as outlined in Annex 15, including the criterion of an ERR of&#13;
12% or more.&#13;
Systems Imorovement and Farmer Turnover (Modernization and Rehabilitation)&#13;
20.   Background:  The productivity of irrigation in Tamil Nadu is well below&#13;
potential. On the majority of irrigation schemes, suboptimal distribution of&#13;
water results in low yields and cropping intensity and reduced opportunities for&#13;
diversifying agriculture. The existing infrastructure of the conveyance system&#13;
has been deteriorating which further aggravates the suboptimal irrigation&#13;
efficiency. The project's modernization, rehabilitation and farmer turnover&#13;
activities are aimed at improving the productivity and efficiency of the&#13;
irrigation system. Modernization and rehabilitation include activities like&#13;
desilting of and repairs to the canals, repairs to structures, selected lining of&#13;
canals and distributaries, on-farm development works, and improved operations&#13;
management of the reservoirs and canals. Integral to the rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization program will be a major thrust to hand over the responsibility of&#13;
operation and maintenance below the distributary level to Water Users&#13;
Associations.&#13;
21.   Investments of this nature are generally considered to have high potential&#13;
returns both in India and in other countries, and available analysis from a&#13;
variety of sources confirms this (India, Irrigation Sector Review, Report No.&#13;
9518-IN). In Tamil Nadu, investments in modernization and rehabilitation are&#13;
currently being financed under the National Water Management Project (NWMP) which&#13;
commenced in the late eighties in seven of the State's schemes. First monitoring&#13;
reports allow to tentatively assess the benefits in selected schemes. Although&#13;
the monitoring process has not been completed because in most schemes the work is&#13;
still ongoing, for two completed schemes, Sathanur and Cumbum Valley, WRO has&#13;
reported impressive increases in both expansion of effectively irrigated area and&#13;
in yield (increases in irrigated area of around 100%, and yield increases in the&#13;
order of 13 - 80% for paddy and groundnut). Most of the other schemes show a&#13;
positive development in expansion of irrigated area (Table 6).&#13;
22.   In total more than 660,000 ha of cultural command area (CCA) would be&#13;
rehabilitated and modernized under WRCP. This includes 17 major and medium (more&#13;
than 2,000 ha per scheme) and 40 minor schemes. The major schemes are further&#13;
divided into stage 1 and stage 2 works. Stage 1 includes the most immediate&#13;
repairs to the major canal system and is limited to expenditures averaging Rs.&#13;
5,300 per hectare. Investments falling under stage 2 include lining of&#13;
distributaries and on farm development works. Stage 2 investments are limited to&#13;
expenditures of not more than Rs. 10,000 (avg. Rs. 7,900) per hectare.&#13;
23.   Benefits:  The major benefits to be expected for agriculture are:  (i)&#13;
increases in cultivable area receiving full and more reliable water supplies&#13;
which allow farmers to increase production intensity, (ii) improved yields&#13;
resulting from reducing moisture stress and by using higher inputs, and (iii)&#13;
intensification and diversification of the cropping patterns to higher value&#13;
crops. Benefits to the non-agricultural sectors comprise more reliable bulk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 245 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
water supplies to domestic and industrial users. Water saved by increasing the&#13;
efficiency of irrigated agricultural production could also be passed on to the&#13;
other sectors in the future. The economic analysis nevertheless evaluates&#13;
increases in surface water supplies in terms of the marginal benefits of water&#13;
supplied to irrigation. Benefits will thus tend to be under-estimated, as&#13;
agricultural water usage usually has lower returns than for industry.&#13;
24.   In nearly all schemes, the actually irrigated Cultural Command Area (CCA)&#13;
is considerably smaller than the originally designed CCA. Moreover, not all of&#13;
the actually irrigated CCA receive sufficient irrigation supplies to fully&#13;
irrigate the crops according to crop water requirements. To give a realistic&#13;
assessment of the situation in Tamil Nadu in the economic analysis, irrigation&#13;
benefits will be divided into benefits resulting from increasing:&#13;
i)    The irrigated area at the tail-end, enabling farmers to switch from&#13;
rainfed to irrigated crops (reducing the gap); and&#13;
ii)   Water deliveries to partially irrigated land, enabling the farmers to&#13;
derive incremental irrigated production (stabilization);&#13;
25.   Methodology:  A detailed economic analysis has been prepared for 16 of the&#13;
17 major schemes covering a designed CCA of 530,000 ha or 80% of the total area&#13;
under consideration. The analysis follows a disaggregated approach looking at&#13;
the agricultural cropping patterns, crop budgets, input use and production for&#13;
each of the 16 major schemes separately. For three of the schemes, information&#13;
on the existing agricultural structure has been prepared in detail jointly by WRO&#13;
and FAO/CP. These three were selected as being representative of the three major&#13;
types of irrigation water supply - canal only, tank only and canal/tank systems.&#13;
The other 13 major schemes have been analyzed using crop budgets provided by the&#13;
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). The results of the economic analysis&#13;
are extrapolated to a medium scheme and the minor schemes which have not been&#13;
separately analyzed because they are scattered all over the State.&#13;
26.   A detailed analysis of the benefits of the three selected model schemes&#13;
(Kodayar, Vaigai Old Ayacut, Lower Bhavani) was carried out by identifying&#13;
presently unirrigated areas, or areas of unreliable irrigation, that would be&#13;
made reliable irrigation areas as a result of the modernization/rehabilitation&#13;
works. Details of the cropping pattern and crop budgets were obtained during&#13;
joint WRO - FAO/CP field visits to each site (Table 7). The analysis of the&#13;
model schemes serves to confirm the economic viability, based on data from WRO&#13;
and TNAU, of the other thirteen modernization schemes.&#13;
27.   The TNAU crop budgets (Table 8) summarize information on inputs, outputs&#13;
and prices and are based on an annual monitoring procedure of farm performance in&#13;
all districts of the State based on a stratified sampling procedure. This farm&#13;
management data base is the only statewide statistical source using actual&#13;
performance information for the 1992/93 farming season. The without project&#13;
yields for the major crops on partially irrigated land are 3.2-5.9 t/ha for&#13;
paddy, 1.2-1.3 t/ha for groundnut, and around 100 t/ha for sugarcane, based on&#13;
observed present yields in each of the different schemes. The wide yield range&#13;
for paddy reflects the differences in yield levels from scheme to scheme (Table&#13;
9). Cropping patterns are established for each scheme based on information&#13;
provided by WRO (Table 10). At full development it is assumed that:&#13;
(i)   The cropping pattern does not change when farmers fully irrigate&#13;
their previously only partially irrigated land. Even though a change&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 246 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
to higher value crops could be expected, this aspect has not been&#13;
included;&#13;
(ii) Rainfed crops are grown on 50% of the non-irrigated land, the&#13;
remainder being left fallow (the gap). This assumption is based on&#13;
national statistics and field observations;&#13;
(iii) Irrigation benefits in stage 1 schemes consist of both a reduction of&#13;
the gap and a shift from partial to full irrigation. Irrigation&#13;
benefits in stage 2 schemes only consist of an increase from partial&#13;
to full irrigation. This division was selected to account for the&#13;
previous investments under the NWMP in stage 2 schemes;&#13;
(iv) In all schemes, about 30% of the presently irrigated CCA moves from&#13;
partial to full irrigation. This estimate has been given by WRO&#13;
engineers and can be described as cautious compared with the first&#13;
monitoring results of NWMP; and&#13;
iv)   Yields, hired labor and fertilizer use increase by 10% with full&#13;
irrigation as compared to partial irrigation. The yield increases&#13;
are based on realistic estimates of TNAU economists.&#13;
28.   The economic analysis for the SIFT component is based on realistic&#13;
assumptions on the incremental irrigation benefits of the project. Especially,&#13;
the division of the irrigation benefits into two groups, partial to full&#13;
irrigation and gap to full irrigation gives a detailed and realistic assessment&#13;
of the actual benefits.&#13;
29.    esaults;  Modernization and rehabilitation of the analyzed 16 major schemes&#13;
would allow to increase irrigation from partial to full supplies on an area of&#13;
107,000 ha, and an additional 34,000 ha presently not receiving any water would&#13;
receive irrigation. After project implementation, annual irrigation benefits&#13;
would amount to Rs. 1,040 million at March 1994 prices. At full development&#13;
total foodgrain production of paddy, and groundnut would increase by 170,000 t&#13;
per year (Table 10).&#13;
30.   The ERR calculation is based on the same economic assumptions as the scheme&#13;
completions. The implementation period for most of the schemes is seven years&#13;
and incremental benefits are phased in, beginning with year 4. Determination of&#13;
construction costs is based on actual costing experience under NWMP which sets&#13;
limits on rehabilitation and modernization costs per hectare. A similar approach&#13;
has accordingly been used with the addition of 10% for physical contingencies on&#13;
civil works and vehicles, and 15% for all equipment. The type of works necessary&#13;
for modernization/rehabilitation does not require large amounts of civil works&#13;
and earthworks, nor major civil works which are subject to considerable cost&#13;
variations. Base cost for civil work average Rs. 5,300/ha for stage 1 and Rs.&#13;
7,900/ha for stage 2 investments. Project costs for this component consist of&#13;
the direct investment costs for the schemes, the farmer turnover component, the&#13;
Irrigation Management &amp; Training Institute, operation and maintenance costs of&#13;
irrigation facilities (budgeted at Rs. 265/ha), and costs for maintenance of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
31.   The overall ERR for this component is 19% and reflects the expected high&#13;
returns from increasing efficiency of already existing schemes. The detailed&#13;
analysis for Kodayar, Vaigai Old Ayacut, and Lower Bhavani gives an ERR of 38%,&#13;
40%, and 24%, respectively. The component is especially robust to cost overruns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 247 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
as the sensitivity analysis for this component reveals. Nevertheless, as with&#13;
the scheme completions, construction costs should be monitored carefully.&#13;
Summary Results of the Economic Analysis&#13;
32.   The overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is based on the same economic&#13;
assumptions as the individual ERR's for the above described components. The&#13;
economic cash flows are presented in Table 11. Total quantified benefits only&#13;
consist of irrigation benefits of which at full development 25% and 75% can be&#13;
attributed to the scheme completions and modernization/rehabilitation components,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
33.   The overall ERR for the project is estimated at 17% and the net present&#13;
value in March 1994 prices at Rs. 1,990 million. The overall ERR is calculated&#13;
as the combined ERR for the project's two investment components, scheme&#13;
completions and modernization/rehabilitation/farmer turnover, which together&#13;
account for 84% of the project's base costs. Costs and benefits have not been&#13;
included for the project's water planning and environmental action plan as well&#13;
as institutional improvement expenditures not directly related to the two&#13;
production components. The expected benefits of the iatter components are&#13;
substantial but are difficult to quantify. If the costs for these items are&#13;
included, but without ascribing benefits, the overall ERR of the total project&#13;
would fall to 13%, and the net present value would be R3. 587 million. At full&#13;
development the project would achieve an incremental foodgrain production of&#13;
paddy and groundnuts of 180,000 t per year.&#13;
Sensitivity and Risks Analysis&#13;
34.   The table below presents the results of the sensitivity and risks analysis&#13;
covering increases in costs, decreases in benefits, and the switching values in&#13;
costs and benefits that would reduce cash flow to break even levels. For example&#13;
if costs increased by 20% the ERR for the overall project would fall from 17% to&#13;
14%. As expected, the SIFT component has higher returns than the scheme&#13;
completions component, which are reflected in both the base case and the various&#13;
scenarios. The switching values illustrate that benefits would have to fall by&#13;
30% or costs to increase by 43% for the ERR to fall to 12%. It is, however,&#13;
unlikely for implementation shortfalls of this magnitude to occur, for several&#13;
reasons:  (i)  estimates of costs are realistic (the SIFT component uses actual&#13;
costing experience of the NWMP and the scheme completion costs are based on&#13;
actual experience with on-going contracts); (ii) estimation of benefits was&#13;
similarly realistic and detailed, using actual farm performance information from&#13;
a statewide farm performance database (SIFT) or data compiled from WRO-FAO/CP&#13;
field visits (completions), and obtaining disaggregated estimates for&#13;
subcomponents of the project components; (iii) GOTN has achieved successful&#13;
piloting of the modernization and rehabilitation activities on a large scale&#13;
(153,000 ha) under NWMP, on which the extension to the larger WRCP program is&#13;
based; (iv) GOTN has demonstrated its commitment to the project's implementation&#13;
and sustainability through successful institutional and fiscal reorganization;&#13;
and (v) WRO has proven capability and successful experience in implementing the&#13;
kind of physical activities called for in the project.&#13;
35.   The table also includes results of risks analysis of three other scenarios,&#13;
i.e. (i) reduced implementation and realization of benefits, (ii) inadequate&#13;
maintenance beyond the project period, and (iii) shortfalls in the Systems&#13;
Improvement and Farmer Turnover component, which investigate their impact on the&#13;
economic rate of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 14&#13;
Page 10 of 11&#13;
36.   Reduced imDlementation and realization of benefits.  While the risk of&#13;
shortfalls in implementation has been reduced through a variety of monitoring and&#13;
incentive mechanisms built into the project to help ensure this, it is&#13;
instructive to investigate the consequences of a delay in the implementation&#13;
process. Under this scenario, where it is assumed that benefits are lagged by 2&#13;
years, the ERR of the overall project would fall from 17% to 13%, the ERR of the&#13;
SIFT component would fall from 19% to 15%, and the ERR of the scheme completions&#13;
component would fall from 15% to 12%.&#13;
37.   Inadequate maintenance beyond the project period.  The table also tests for&#13;
a scenario that would develop if the WRCP's objectives to sustain full&#13;
maintenance (supported by improved cost recovery and farmer turnover) were not&#13;
continued beyond the project period, i.e. a historically relevant non-&#13;
sustainability scenario. This scenario is possible if funds for 0 &amp; M fall short&#13;
of expectations after the project implementation period, resulting in&#13;
significantly reduced long term benefits. The sensitivity test therefore assumes&#13;
a scenario of gradually decreasing benefits, where: (i) the incremental benefits&#13;
of the modernization/rehabilitation component cannot be sustained after year 10&#13;
and progressively fall to zero in year 20 producing no incremental benefits&#13;
thereafter, and (ii) the incremental net benefits of the scheme completions would&#13;
drop from 100% in year 10 to 50% in year 30. Under these assumptions the ERR&#13;
would fall from 17% to 13% and the NPV would fall from Rs. 1,990 million to Rs.&#13;
350 million. This test illustrates the importance and the high pay-off of full&#13;
funding of adequate maintenance requirements, hence the attention paid to full&#13;
funding and vigorous monitoring of maintenance under the WRCP. GOTN funding of&#13;
maintenance was brought to full requirements in the April 1994 budget, and GOTN&#13;
has spelled out in its Letter of Development Policy its intentions for sustained&#13;
funding for maintenance functions.&#13;
38.   Shortfalls in the Systems Improvement &amp; Farmer Turnover component.  The&#13;
potential exists for less than satisfactory completion of the SIFT component.&#13;
SIFT incorporates an innovative public-private partnership-that calls for new&#13;
kinds of skills and markedly different attitudes on the part of both government&#13;
personnel and farmers. In particular, management of farmer organizations are&#13;
intended to be autonomous and must no longer be subjected to bureaucratic or&#13;
political pressures. The inherent risk is that the bureaucracy may not easily&#13;
undergo the necessary transformation and may continue to exert influence on&#13;
farmer organizations. A scenario that tests for this possibility of incomplete&#13;
implementation of SIFT assumes: (i) a 2 year lag in benefits, (ii) a 30%&#13;
shortfall in benefits, and (iii) a 20% increase in costs. Under these&#13;
assumptions the ERR would drop from 19% to 13% for SIFT and from i7% to 14% for&#13;
the overall project. The NPV would fall from Rs. 1,652 million to Rs. 186&#13;
million for SIFT, and from Rs. 1,990 million to Rs. 524 million for the overall&#13;
project.&#13;

1/ Scheme completions component.&#13;
2/ Modernization/rehabilitation/farmer turnover component.&#13;
3/ Overall Project results calculated for components 1) and 2).&#13;
4/ Amount benefits would have to decrease, or costs to increase, for the ERR to fall to 12%.&#13;
5/ Two year delay in benefits, 30% benefits shortfall, and 20% increase in costs.&#13;
6/ Incremental benefits of the SIFT (mod/rehab) component decrease progressively from&#13;
100% in year 10 to zero in year 20, producing no incremental benefits thereafter;&#13;
Incremental benefits of the scheme completions drop progressively from 100% in year&#13;
10 to 50% in year 30.&#13;
39.    The sensitivity and risks analysis above demonstrates the robustness of&#13;
both components in addition to the overall project, and confirms the soundness of&#13;
the proposed investment. The analysis further emphasizes the importance of&#13;
strict adherence to the project's implementation, monitoring and maintenance&#13;
guidelines. Close monitoring of implementation activities, continuation of&#13;
budgetary allocations for maintenance functions beyond project completion, and an&#13;
emphasis on improving the interaction between public and private institutions,&#13;
would ensure that the project yields the expected benefits.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Criteria For Preparation and Selection of Investment&#13;
1.   Introduction.  This annex deals with the criteria to be utilized by WRO&#13;
in the preparation of future investment schemes that may be included in&#13;
the WRO's work program within the seven-year implementation period of&#13;
the WRCP. The WRCP investments are directed to rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of irrigation schemes and completion of civil works&#13;
related to other schemes. The latter focus on improving the source of&#13;
supply of water to existing traditional irrigation infrastructure. On&#13;
the policy side, WRCP focusses on setting up and strengthening of&#13;
institutions dealing with irrigation and improving the water resource&#13;
utilization planning capabilities of GOTN. As discussed in other&#13;
sections of the SAR, Tamil Nadu is a water deficit state with most of&#13;
the current utilization of surface and ground water being in the&#13;
agriculture sector. With the growth in the industrial sector and the&#13;
need to provide the population with clean drinking water at a higher per&#13;
capita consumption rate, competing demands on this limited resource will&#13;
increase. Future schemes to meet these requirements in other sectors&#13;
would involve transfer of water from agricultural use. In order to meet&#13;
and maintain agricultural water requirements, additional schemes similar&#13;
to those supported under this WRCP may be required. These needs may&#13;
indeed arise over the next seven-year period as better basin plans are&#13;
prepared and water utilization projects are identified and executed in&#13;
other sectors. As a case in point, GOTN is currently preparing a water&#13;
supply project to be implemented by TWAD Board' to provide potable water&#13;
to the city of Madras which might involve transfer of water from&#13;
agricultural use to municipal use. In the future, WRO would be&#13;
responsible for providing bulk water supplies to municipal and&#13;
industrial sectors2. There are also other schemes in planning stages&#13;
similar to the nine scheme completions supported under this WRCP. in&#13;
order to allow for investment assistance from IDA for such developments,&#13;
an unidentified category has been established under the scheme&#13;
completions component. Approval by IDA and the inclusion of any such&#13;
future schemes under the WRCP would be dependant upon their satisfying&#13;
the set of criteria outlined below.&#13;
1/   Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board.&#13;
2/   These schemes would deliver untreated water at bulk rates to the&#13;
municipal or industrial unit and therefore would involve only the&#13;
development of a source be it surface water or subsurface water or&#13;
both. Agencies such as TWAD Board and METROWATER will continue their&#13;
role in urban water supply and drainage.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 15&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
2.   Preparation and Selection Criteria.  These criteria include the&#13;
essential requirements that the schemes are: (a) prepared in the context&#13;
of a river basin development considering all water use needs; (b) well&#13;
prepared from all engineering, agricultural and other technical&#13;
perspectives; (c) economically viable; (d) in full compliance with&#13;
environmental and social requirements; and (e) identified and prepared&#13;
in full consultation with beneficiaries. The criteria for investment&#13;
scheme preparation and selection are:&#13;
I.     Basin Plan:  The scheme should be prepared in the context of a&#13;
river basin plan taking into account probable competing demands on the&#13;
water source to be developed; it should fit in an overall riverbasin or&#13;
subbasin development plan prepared by WRO.&#13;
II.    Water Demand:  Estimates of water demands should be prepared&#13;
taking into account the economic life of the proposed scheme. In the&#13;
case of municipal and industrial sectors such estimates would be&#13;
provided to the WRO by the responsible entities. WRO should ensure that&#13;
these estimates cover a projected service period and specify the degree&#13;
of reliability required. In the case of irrigation schemes, crop water&#13;
requirements should be prepared on the basis of climatic data using&#13;
standard methodology3 taking into account the contribution of effective&#13;
rainfall. In estimating these demands, soils and land suitability for&#13;
potential crops to be grown under the scheme should be established based&#13;
on data obtained from the agricultural department and future crops,&#13;
cropping patterns and crop calendars should be established in&#13;
consultation with farmer and agricultural department officials.&#13;
III.   Water Availability:  Detailed hydrological studies and reservoir&#13;
yield analysis using standard methodology for supplies at the degree&#13;
required. Quality of water supplied from the scheme must meet prevalent&#13;
standards for raw water supply to municipalities or water boards,&#13;
industries and agriculture as appropriate. In the case of groundwater&#13;
exploitation4 , analysis of aquifer capacity, dynamic recharge potential&#13;
for various probabilities, drawdown rates, pump capacities, availability&#13;
of power to operate the prime movers and cost of such power should be&#13;
estimated. In the case of irrigation schemes, wells in the scheme&#13;
command must be identified and studied to establish conjunctive use&#13;
which must be reflected in water balance computations. Analysis of&#13;
existing irrigation infrastructure to clearly identify possible measures&#13;
such as improving existing storages through dredging and improving&#13;
3/   Modified Penman-Monteith method is currently used by FAOCP to estimate&#13;
potential evapotranspiration rates.&#13;
4/   This possibility is included for any such future eventuality.  None of&#13;
the appraised WRCP investments involves investment in groundwater&#13;
explotation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 277 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
efficiency of delivery systems should be prepared and the necessity to&#13;
build new storages should be clearly established.&#13;
IV.    Engineering:  Detailed engineering designs and implementation&#13;
schedules, based on WRO capability and optimal contract packages, should&#13;
be prepared.&#13;
V.     Operation and Maintenance Plan:  Detailed 0 &amp; M plan for the&#13;
scheme should be prepared clearly spelling out the role of the end user&#13;
in these and the financial and technical inputs required on a recurrent&#13;
basis with an indication of how these requirements would be met.&#13;
VI.    Environmental Assessment:  Necessary environmental impact studies&#13;
should be prepared and mitigating measures if required should be&#13;
identified and an action plan to implement such measures prepared. If&#13;
the scheme involves building dams higher that 10m, designs would have to&#13;
be presented to State DSRP and their concurrence obtained. Riparian&#13;
rights should be assessed as well as impact on downstream users. In the&#13;
event of a downstream user being affected, a counterimpact scheme should&#13;
be prepared or suitable remedial measures be identified and included in&#13;
the development of the scheme.&#13;
VII.   Resettlement and Rehabilitation:  Detailed action plan for the&#13;
economic rehabilitaion of scheme-affected persons should be prepared&#13;
together with an implementation schedule and costed. Baseline&#13;
socioeconomic surveys should be conducted to assist in this process. In&#13;
the preparation of above, both reservoir area and pipeline or other&#13;
delivery mechanism route should be included. Land acquisition and&#13;
economic rehabilitaion plans together with realistic schedules for such&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation should be prepared.&#13;
VIII. Costs and Benefits: Detailed costs for the engineering works&#13;
should be prepared taking into account prevailing contract rates and&#13;
optimal contract packages. The total costs should include LAER costs&#13;
arising from the environmental impact assessment. Annual recurrent&#13;
costs based on the 0 &amp; M plan should also be included. In the case of&#13;
irrigation schemes an estimate of annual net agricultural benefits&#13;
should be made taking into account existing agricultural support&#13;
services and an analysis of the markets for the agricultural produce .5&#13;
A detailed farming systems study should be carried out and the financial&#13;
impact of the scheme on the beneficiary farmers be estimated.&#13;
IX.    Economic viability:  Detailed economic analysis should be carried&#13;
out using standard methodology (refer FAOCP reports for nine schemes).&#13;
The economic rate of return should be 12% or greater. Social factors&#13;
such as poverty alleviation, regional development etc., which could&#13;
5/   Unquanitified benefits (e.g. environmental, or health benefits from&#13;
domestic water supply schemes) may also be documented, and where&#13;
feasible, benefits ascribed.&#13;

influence choice where ranking of different investment options are&#13;
similar, may also be documented.&#13;
X.     Cost Recovery:  For bulk water supply schemes, establishment of&#13;
cost of water for each scheme and agreement with the recipient on&#13;
financial terms of supply. Legal agreement as needed should be&#13;
prepared. For irrigation schemes, terms of cost recovery and farmer&#13;
responsibilities should be agreed through memorandum of understanding.&#13;

INDTA&#13;
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJTECT&#13;
Maintenance. Water Charges and Cost Recovery&#13;
1.    As a result of recent initiatives, Tamil Nadu has substantially improved&#13;
its situation as regards funding of maintenance and actual and prospective&#13;
cost recovery. Most important, GOTN is now fully funding maintenance&#13;
expenditure needs. Second, water charges have been increased and now cover&#13;
maintenance expenditure and the bulk of other recurrent costs. GOTN is also&#13;
examining additional ways of improving water sector financing provisions and&#13;
revenues, and the project would further assist in this process.&#13;
2.    Maintenance Funding.  In the past, Tamil Nadu has chronically&#13;
underfunded irrigation maintenance, resulting in progressive deterioration of&#13;
infrastructure. Recognising the need - pervasive in almost every Indian state&#13;
- to substantially increase funding for maintenance works, GOTN has&#13;
progressively increased its allocations for operations and maintenance over&#13;
the last three years including an informal committment to IDA made in 1993 at&#13;
the beginning of project preparation that maintenance funding would be at full&#13;
required levels by project commencement and in all future years. From a&#13;
funding level for operations and maintenance averaging only Rs 103/ha in&#13;
1989/90, GOTN increased O&amp;M funding to Rs 120/ha in 1992/93, Rs 200/ha in&#13;
1993/94 and Rs 265/ha for the 1994/95 fiscal year. The 1994/95 allocation&#13;
comprises a separate allocation to "maintenance works" (civil works,&#13;
maintenance contracts and materials) of Rs 150/ha (the remaining Rs 115/ha&#13;
being for staffing and other non-works recurrent costs). This follows the&#13;
recommendations of PWD/WRO engineers and the Bank, and represents the full&#13;
estimated requirement for maintenance works (94/95 prices) for the 1994/95&#13;
season.&#13;
3.    An important detail in Tamil Nadu's Non-Plan funding provisions to WRO&#13;
is that funding is disaggregated and earmarked. "Maintenance Works" have&#13;
separate budget heads from establishment and other recurrent costs, and funds&#13;
for "works" go into separate bank accounts, earmarked for works contracts and&#13;
materials, with the relevant local branches of the State Bank of India. This&#13;
desirable situation is being increasingly adopted by Indian states and will&#13;
continue in Tamil Nadu. A common situation, applicable in Tamil Nadu also&#13;
until recently, is that overall Non-Plan allocations are barely enough to&#13;
cover staff salaries. As in such situations staff salaries have always had&#13;
first call on funds, little has been left for actual maintenance. As staff&#13;
salaries can be assumed payed, protecting the maintenance works budget is the&#13;
critical need for sustaining water service infrastructure. The other needs&#13;
are farmer pa-rticipation (non-breakages of structures, farmer turnover for the&#13;
critical and most usually neglected lower levels of irrigation systems) and&#13;
better planning, management and technical capability for O&amp;M directorates of&#13;
irrigation departments.&#13;
4.    Water Charges.  Tamil Nadu's water charges for irrigation are made up of&#13;
a "basic irrigation rate', an "irrigation cess" which is calculated as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 280 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
multiple of the basic rate and an "additional irrigation cess", also a&#13;
multiple of the basic rate. The basic rate, and the resultant overall water&#13;
charge through the cess multipliers, is calculated by crop, soil type and&#13;
season and presently has over a hundred rates. Through adjustments of the&#13;
cesses, GOTN has progressively increased charges for irrigation, the most&#13;
recent adjustment being in 1991. The typical rate now amounts to between Rs&#13;
200-210/ha, amongst the highest water charges in India. The present water&#13;
charges more than cover expenditure needs for maintenance works (Rs 150/ha in&#13;
1994/95), and cover about 80% of all recurrent expenditure costs of WRO&#13;
including establishment (both staff employed on O&amp;M and other staff).&#13;
5.    GOTN has also applied a policy of freezing all recruitment to PWD, and&#13;
envisages continuing this for WRO until staff numbers are balanced to work&#13;
needs. This will bring establishment costs down further, and the farmer&#13;
turnover program under the project will allow continued decline in O&amp;M staff&#13;
requirements as farmers assume greater responsibilities.&#13;
6.    For commercial and industrial bulk supplies from WRO, rates have also&#13;
been increased. From very low previous levels, both industrial and&#13;
commercial, rates were increased in 1986, and then subjected to a further&#13;
increase of eightfold in 1991: from Rs 60/1000 cubic meters to Rs 500/1000&#13;
c.m. A temporary court order injunction has since resulted in rates being&#13;
brought down to Rs200/1000 c.m. This is still below service costs but is well&#13;
above typical rates in other Indian states. Supplies for drinking water are&#13;
supplied free of charge. Major drainage and flood protection works are also&#13;
supplied free.&#13;
7.    Further initiatives are expected from the work of GOTN's "Water Rates&#13;
Rationalization Committee". This is examining agricultural rates. Based on&#13;
the interim conclusions of the committee, likely recommendations will be a&#13;
significant simplification of the present array of rates; from over 100 to&#13;
less than 20. The committee is also examining ways of equitably increasing&#13;
overall revenues. Final recommendations are expected in 1995.&#13;
8.    The WRCP would further build on these initiatives.  Full and timely&#13;
provision of maintenance works funds by GOTN, a matter already agreed (and&#13;
implemented for the 1994/95 year, see above) would be confirmed at&#13;
negotiations and be the subject of a closely monitored assurance. "GOTN&#13;
would: (a) provide annually to WRO the full funds required for maintenance to&#13;
sustain the infrastructure in full operating order; (b) funds would continue&#13;
to be allocated to a separate and protected maintenance works budget exempt&#13;
from withdrawals for salaries and wages; (c) the maintenance works budget&#13;
would be available from the beginning of the fiscal year so as not to impede&#13;
maintenance activities; and (d) WRO would submit its annual budget estimate&#13;
for maintenance to GOTN and IDA based on detailed command-by-command estimates&#13;
following an agreed reporting, programming and budgeting and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation process" (Annex 4).&#13;
9.    on the revenues side, an important need is to have a permanent&#13;
institutional apparatus for review of the costs of water services and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 281 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
revenues received, and for annual review of status and possible adjustments.&#13;
In Tamil Nadu's case, industrial, commercial and agricultural rates have all&#13;
been the subject of recent increases, and intent for further change in&#13;
agricultural rates is evidenced by the present work of the Water Rates&#13;
Rationalization Committee. This, however, is not a permanent body and is&#13;
restricted in mandate to agricultural rates. The fact of recent price changes&#13;
and the work of the committee is nevertheless welcome relative to situations&#13;
in many states where rates have not been changed for many years, in some cases&#13;
for over a decade. While political constraints are present, an important&#13;
contributing factor is the absence of any mechanism and responsible party to&#13;
annually review and make recommendations on service costs and fees. As change&#13;
is unpopular, there is little incentive for any party to propose adjustments,&#13;
and understanding of the disaggregated costs and revenues of water service&#13;
provision is also often incomplete. GOTN, thus intends to establish a&#13;
permanent "Water Service Costs and Revenues Committee". This would be chaired&#13;
by the Secretary, PWD/WRO with membership comprising Secretaries Finance,&#13;
Revenues Department, Land Administration, Agriculture, Municipal&#13;
Administration, TWAD, Metrowater and WRO's EIC and Basin Managers, and a co-&#13;
opted Consultant economist. The consultant would, under the direction of the&#13;
committee, prepare an annual status report covering the service costs&#13;
(recurrent and taking account of capital recovery) of all water services&#13;
(irrigation, drainage, flood control, rural drinking water, municipal,&#13;
industrial and commercial), fees applied and revenues, with regional&#13;
disaggregation as appropriate (for instance by basin/major water source and&#13;
major urban centers), and disaggregated and overall net revenues-costs&#13;
situation. The annual report and any recommendations forthcoming from the&#13;
committee would be distributed annually for consideration by state authorities&#13;
(Cabinet and Bureaucracy). WRCP funds would cover the costs of Tamil Nadu's&#13;
consultant over the life of the project, and the costs of an additional short-&#13;
term consultant employed in PY1 to help establish a computerised and&#13;
updateable multi-sectoral model.&#13;
10.   The WRCP's Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover Program will offer an&#13;
opportunity to further improve on the financial situation of service provision&#13;
for agricultural use. Cost recovery for irrigation has been impeded India-&#13;
wide by the frequently low quality of the service. Poor irrigation and lack&#13;
of involvement of farmers in irrigation operational plans, water management&#13;
decisions and management and maintenance of irrigation leaves a disaffected&#13;
farming community, lack of a sense of "ownership" in the irrigation system and&#13;
resistance to water charge increases, usually seen as a tax unrelated to&#13;
irrigation and with no correspondence to service quality.&#13;
11.   The WRCP's Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover program will include&#13;
the following actions impacting on service costs and revenues. On the&#13;
investment side, for "On-Farm-Development", large savings will accrue from&#13;
state withdrawal to the role of topographic survey and extension, with&#13;
construction limited to provision of outlet and profile wall structures, and&#13;
with farmers rather than WRO or AED now handling water channels, field&#13;
channels and field drains. State investment costs at this level would come&#13;
down from Rs 3500/ha to Rs 500/ha. For distributaries lining, investmet would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 282 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
now involve a 20% contribution from farmers. Lining has usually been the most&#13;
expensive item under modernisation programs for the secondary distribution&#13;
system, and has often been excessively applied, especially where groundwater&#13;
recharge would be beneficial. By establishing farmer contributions for this&#13;
item, generally less essential than the water control structures, cost savings&#13;
would result both from the contributions from farmers and from reduction in&#13;
the demand for lining, which will be substantially reduced to reaches where&#13;
farmers consider it to have significant benefits. On the recurrent&#13;
expenditure side, members of farmer councils would make an up-front&#13;
contribution of Rs 250/ha to their bank account and would take over&#13;
maintenance and operations of their distributaries under the Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding established with WRO. This would reduce WRO's notional&#13;
maintenance costs by about 30%, though its overall effect would be gradual in&#13;
line with progress under the turnover program.&#13;
12.   Measures beyond the above would also be considered by the Water Service&#13;
Costs and Revenues Committee. First, a service fee increase (conceptually&#13;
like a betterment levy) could be considered for stage II investments. Second,&#13;
the current practice of all rural revenues being collected by the Revenues&#13;
Department could adjust to collection by Farmer Councils. A limited objective&#13;
could be for Farmer Councils being allowed to collect, still pass on to the&#13;
Revenues Department, but retain a percentage as collection reward, with higher&#13;
percentage retention against higher collection rates (actual collections&#13;
divided by dues). A relatively easy adaptation would be for Farmer Councils&#13;
to be charged volumetrically (measuring devices are part of the package for&#13;
monitoring of water flows and the physical means would thus already be&#13;
present). This is a highly likely evolution as experience is gained under the&#13;
program. More fundamentally, GOTN should look towards going beyond&#13;
internalising O&amp;M costs and revenues at distributary levels to achieving the&#13;
same objective at the levels of entire commands and at state level; ie&#13;
progression towards a "utility" approach, with funds collected and used&#13;
directly by the service provider. Funds could be collected by Councils,&#13;
agreed proportions passed on to the command level Apex Committees, and&#13;
proportions handed on to the WRO bank account for the command concerned, with&#13;
part handed on to WRO overhead expenses, with revenue-sharing related to costs&#13;
of each entity. As regards management of O&amp;M, farmer responsibility reaching&#13;
beyond the level of distributary head, and perhaps to whole command (below the&#13;
headworks) is a possible evolution, particularly for medium commands where a&#13;
tradition of farmer organization is already strong. An objective under the&#13;
project will be to encourage and facilitate any such initiatives as&#13;
opportunities are identified. It is expected that at least some commands&#13;
would be ready for further initiatives within several years. In the immediate&#13;
time frame, however, the key need is to strongly establish the system&#13;
improvement and farmer turnover program and gain the confidence and&#13;
satisfaction of the farmers. On this basis, larger steps such as the above&#13;
would have a good foundation for their success.&#13;

Tamil Nadu is the southernmost state in the Indian Union&#13;
located between 6805' and 13°34' north latitutdes and 76b14'&#13;
and S021' east longitudes and covering an area of 1.:0 lakh&#13;
Sq.Kms. which is about 4 percent of the total area of the&#13;
country. The state borders Andhrapradesh on the north,&#13;
Karnataka an the northwest and Kerala on the west, and in&#13;
the east by the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean on the&#13;
south.&#13;
PHYSIOGRAPHY&#13;
Varied topographical features ranging from coastal&#13;
plains to high mountains are found in Tamil Nadu. The State&#13;
is divided into four physiogrpahic regions. The coastal&#13;
plain stretches about 1000 Kms., comprising of northern&#13;
plain (comprising Chungleput District and parts of South&#13;
Arcot, North Arcot and Tiruchi Districts), the Cauvery delta&#13;
(Thaniavur District and parts of Trichy, South Arcot and&#13;
Pudukkottai Districts) and the southern coastal plain&#13;
(shared by Ramnad, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari Districts).&#13;
The eastern ghats comprise of hills, the Javadis,&#13;
Shervaroys, Kalrayans, Pachamalais and Kollimalais between&#13;
Palar and Cauvery river%.&#13;
The central plateau undulate between eastern and western&#13;
ghats 150--160 m in elevation with the Palghat Gap betwewn&#13;

Nilgiris and the Anamalai Hills on the west. The western&#13;
ghats comprise the higheut mountains of the Peninsula. The&#13;
Nilgiris located on the northern side of Palghat gap form a&#13;
compact area with a Summit 10Oevl of 1830 to 2440 m. To the&#13;
south of Palghat gap is the Anamalais zone of the highest&#13;
peaks of the Peninsula. Palani hills overlooking river&#13;
vaigai and Cardamom hills on the continuation of western&#13;
ghats.&#13;
The major rivwrs of the state' are Cauvery, vaigai&#13;
Tambraparani, Ponnaiar and Palar.&#13;
POPULATION&#13;
The state's overall population increased from 30.12&#13;
million in 1951 to 55.64 million in 19912. The annual&#13;
increase between 1981 to 19912 was 1.49/. As per 1991&#13;
census report the literacy rate is 54.61/. The density of&#13;
population per Sq.Km. is 428 against the National Level&#13;
of 257.  Of the total population of 55. 4 million in 1991,&#13;
36.61 million are in rural areas and 19.03 million in urban&#13;
areas synchronising with farm and industrial activities&#13;
respectively.&#13;

EMPLOYMENT&#13;
The occupational structure of population is an important&#13;
component of human resource assessment and also is an&#13;
indicator for development planning. In agricultural&#13;
operations, human labour contributes to the major unit of&#13;
operational cost.&#13;
The total principal workers under different occupation&#13;
constitute 22.97 million as per 1991 census reports. Of&#13;
this total, 5.73 million are cultivators and 7.B5 million&#13;
form agricultural labourers. Of the total working group of&#13;
22.97 million the cultivators alone constitute 24.9% (5.73&#13;
million) and the agricultural labourwr form 34.1% (7.85&#13;
million), indicating the maJor working group dependent on&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
STATE INCOME&#13;
The estimate of state income is expressed in the form of&#13;
N.S.D.P. (Net State Domestic Product) and compared to N.D.P.&#13;
(National Domestic Product). Please see Table 1.&#13;
The state per capita income at constant price during the&#13;
sixth plan period was 1601 (Rupees) and during the seventh&#13;
plan period it was 1854 (1985-86 to 1989-90). The per&#13;
capita income of Tamil Nadu at constant prices was lower&#13;
than the National level of 1721 and 1967 during the same&#13;
period of sixth and seventh plans respectively.&#13;
The quick estimate for 1990-91 indicate the state per&#13;
capita income as Rs 1965.&#13;
The per capita income is worked out based on total&#13;
population and there are no details for rural population&#13;
exclusively.&#13;

RAINFALL -&#13;
The rainfall in the state is highly variable. The state&#13;
receives rainfall both during the southwest monsoon and the&#13;
northeast monsoon. The amount of rainfall received during&#13;
the northeast monsoon is significantly higher than that of&#13;
southwest monsoon. The rainfall received during southwest&#13;
monsoon indicates a decreasing trend from north to south.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

As the northeast monsoon is associated with cyclonic&#13;
depressions from the Bay of Bengal, the rainfall is highest&#13;
on the coast and decreases westwards. The following table 2&#13;

LANDUSE&#13;
The land usa pattern is very much governed by the&#13;
topography. Areas with hilly terrain on the western and&#13;
northwestern borders of state have large proportion of&#13;
for-sts andr uncultivated land.  The intwnsity of cropping in&#13;
the plains has a bearing on the irrigation potwntial. The&#13;
size of th. operational holdings is also an indwx of the&#13;
social status of the farmer.&#13;
The following Table 4 indicate the ninefold&#13;
classification of land uses the different category of&#13;

The soils of Tamil Nadu broadly fall into four major&#13;
groups (i.e.), ti) black uoila, (ii) rod %oils, (iii)&#13;
alluvial soils and (iv) laterites. Black soils cover an&#13;
area of 27.112 lakh hectares covering all the districts in&#13;
the state. These black soils are either shallow or deep&#13;
Lupto 5 meters. As these soils contain 30 to 50% clay they&#13;
crack in summer due to shrinkage on drying. These soils are&#13;
poor in organic matter, nitrogen and phospherous but rich in&#13;
potash and lime.&#13;
The red soils are the maJor type covering 57.460 L.Ha.&#13;
with five broad groups as red loam, red inf@rtile soil, red&#13;
sandy soil, thin red soil and deep red soil.  The red loam&#13;
occurs in the districts of Chingleput, North Arcot, SoLuth&#13;
Arcot, Salem and parts of Trichi, having medium depth with&#13;
good drainage. Red infertile soil occurs in the districts&#13;
of Trichi, Madurai and Ramnad having shallow, light gravelly&#13;
and stony nature. Rod sandy soil occurs in Madurai, Ramnad&#13;
and Trichi districts, with sandy loam texture, shallow in&#13;
depth, good drainage.&#13;
Thin red soils are found in Coimbatore and Madurai&#13;
districts and are shallow in depth. Deep red soils are&#13;
-found in parts of Coimbatore, Madurai, Ramnad, Tirunelveli&#13;
and Kanyakumari districts and these soils are deep and loamy&#13;
in texture.  Alluvial soils occupy an area of 2.159 L.Ha.&#13;
This is classified as saline coastal alluvium and river&#13;
allu)vium. The saline coastal alluvium appears along the&#13;
coast as a narrow belt in the districts of Chingleput, South&#13;
Arcot, ThanJavur, Ramnad, Tirunelvwli and Kanyakumari.  The&#13;
texture of these soils varies from sandy loam to sand.&#13;
The rivwr alluvium are the transported soils found in&#13;
deltaic areas of Tirunulveli districts. The major portion&#13;
of Cauvwry alluvium lies in Thanjavur district.  These soils&#13;

IRRIGATED AREA&#13;
As per 1990-91 statistics the total cropped area is&#13;
66,31,761 Ha. Out of this 29,93,880 Ha are irrigated.&#13;
The contribution of Irrigation towards the AgricLtlture&#13;
in Tamil Nadu is 44%.&#13;
Among the various sources of irrigation, surface water&#13;
through canals and tanks irrigate 52.6% of the cultivated&#13;
area while the ground water supply through well% and other&#13;
sources cover 47.4%.  The canal irrigation is important in&#13;
Cauvwry, Palar, Ponnaiyar, Amaravathi, Vaigai and&#13;
Tambaraparani commands. Tank irrigation is the major source&#13;
in the districts of Ramnad, TirLunelveli, Kanyakumari,&#13;
Chingleput and North Arcot. Well irrigation covers major&#13;
area on tho western part of the state. The following tables&#13;
(7 and 8) data indicate the varying source of irrigation and&#13;

DRAINAGE, WATER LOGGING AND SALINITY-&#13;
The rivers in this state generally flow from west to&#13;
east.. Cauvery systwm is the major one that drains more than&#13;
one third of the state. The area to the north of Cauvary&#13;
basin is drained by the Palar, the Ponnaiyar and the Vollar&#13;
rivers. The area to the south of the Cauvery basin is&#13;
drained by the Vaigai, the Gundar, the Vaippar and&#13;
Tambaraparani. The drainage over greater part of Tamil Nadu&#13;
follows the pattern of branching of a tree. The total&#13;
drainage area in the state is 1.30 lakh Sq.Km. of which&#13;
Cauvery basin accounts for 0.4B7 lakh Sq.Km. followed by&#13;
Ponnaiyar (0.12 lakh Sq.Km.) and Palar (0.10 Lakh Sq.Km.).&#13;
Tamil Nadu is highly vulnerable to cyclonic depressions&#13;
and flooding. The depressions and cyclones are frequent&#13;
during the months of Octobwr, November and December (i.e.,&#13;
northeast monsoon) along the coast from Madras to Ramnad.&#13;
As these- depressions move along from east to west, extensive&#13;
flooding in the low lying areas af the rivwr basins occur.&#13;

SALINITY AND ALKALINITY t0&#13;
The growth and produLCtivity of crops are affected by&#13;
soils with high salt content. The soils containing wxcess&#13;
neutral soluble salts of chlorides and sulphates of calcium,&#13;
spdium and magnesium are saline soils and those soils&#13;
containing excess exchangeable sodium are alkali or sodic&#13;
soils. Saline soils are widely distributed in arid and&#13;
semi-arid and in seasonally dry coastal areas. Saline soils&#13;
occLur due to high salt content in the profile, saline ground&#13;
water and high water table, seepage from canals and higher&#13;
adjacent irrigated areas, poor surface and subsurface&#13;
drainage, irrigation with water of high salt content and&#13;
intrusion of sea water, occurrence of salt layer in the %oil&#13;
crust and rise of water table.&#13;
Alkaline soils have higher pH content (more than 6.0).&#13;
Acid soils have pH lass than 6.0.  These acid soils are&#13;
charctmristic of high rainfall areas and are duo to&#13;
laterization, intense leaching and marshy conditions.&#13;
In this state, saline and alkaline soils are spread over&#13;
in 4.115 Lakh Ha. while acidic soils occur in 1.231 Lakh Ha.&#13;
Districtwise distribution of these soils is given in&#13;

TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT&#13;
Criteria for the Selection of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
The project would seek NGO participation in various activities related&#13;
to farmer organizations and beneficiary participation in management, operation&#13;
and maintenance of irrigation systems, and to land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation of project affected persons. Tamil Nadu's Water Resources&#13;
Organisation (WRO) would invite from interested NGOs detailed proposals for&#13;
collaboration. WRO would be responsible for reviewing the proposals and&#13;
agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NGOs in the project. The&#13;
selection of NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:&#13;
(a) As part of legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body&#13;
under the relevant State Law. It should regularly maintain its accounting&#13;
records and have properly audited annual statements of income and expenditure.&#13;
(b) Since the program involves working primarily with small and&#13;
marginal farmers, it is essential that the NGO has a proven track record in&#13;
community development in the agrarian setting. To avoid creating any biases&#13;
and misconceptions in the minds of the people, the NGO should be secular and&#13;
non-political in the conduct of its field activities.&#13;
(c) As the project requires NGO support for farmer organization&#13;
activities over many sites, and for land acquisition and economic&#13;
rehabilitation in seven completion sub-projects, NGO's should have adequate&#13;
numbers of field level staff conversant with the local dialect and customs,&#13;
and having a clear understanding of the socio-economic and political situation&#13;
of the area or areas in which they will operate. They should also possess&#13;
excellent communication skills and good rapport with the community so as to&#13;
involve them in their own farmer organization or economic rehabilitation.&#13;
(d) A prior understanding of the concept of Water Resources&#13;
Consolidation Project and experience in areas relevant to the NGO's interest&#13;
in project participation (for instance, in community development, farmer&#13;
organization, and land acquisition and economic rehabilitation) would be&#13;
desirable. Owing to the nature and extent of the physical coverage of the&#13;
program, each selected NGO will be part of the community organisation or land&#13;
acquisition and economic rehabilitation process. Hence, the NGO should be&#13;
able to interact smoothly with, and be a part of, a team.&#13;
(e) Finally, the NGO should have internal stability so as to assure&#13;
long-term support to the project.&#13;
