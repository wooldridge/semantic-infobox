AN INTEGRATED REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This year, IFC is consolidating our former Annual Report, Sustainability Report,&#13;
and Report to Donors, as well as new reporting on our development effective-&#13;
ness. The report covers fiscal year 2007 and discusses the year's new business&#13;
as well as the performance and development results of our portfolio. It also in-&#13;
corporates information on partnerships that fund many of our advisory services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Our goal is to provide in one place a full picture of what IFC does and how&#13;
we are performing, and to report in a way that is relevant to many of our&#13;
stakeholders: client companies, partners, member governments, local commu-&#13;
nities affected by our activities, advocacy organizations, investors, and our staff.&#13;
We are doing this to enhance our accountability and because these four&#13;
themes--development results, financial success, sustainability, and work&#13;
with partners--combine to drive IFC's success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The principles of the Global Reporting Initiative have helped us improve our&#13;
reporting and conform to international best practice; a full GRI index is available&#13;
at the Annual Report's Web site, www.ifc.org/annualreport. In addition to the&#13;
statement from the financial auditors, this report features for the first time an&#13;
independent assurance statement on its nonfinancial information.&#13;

                                               pleased to introduce a report that gives the fullest picture yet of the breadth&#13;
   Already I have seen up close how IFC's investments in Cambodia's ACLEDA Bank have helped&#13;

&#13;
in remote areas of the country. In Vietnam, I have seen a country moving closer to the ranks of&#13;
                                               and IDA--as well as MIGA, and this allows us to offer a full range of products&#13;

governments set policy and improve the investment climate, and IFC helps companies through advice and catalytic investments&#13;

   Ultimately, the work of IFC--along with that of the other entities of the World Bank Group--is about linking markets and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Taking IFC to the next level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial year 2007 was a remarkable one for IFC. We delivered strong, measurable&#13;
&#13;
development impact and continued to show how the private sector creates&#13;
&#13;
opportunities in emerging markets--especially for the millions of poor people who&#13;
&#13;
most need help. We also achieved the strongest financial position in our history.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's staff has worked hard to advance our mission, and they have had strong&#13;
&#13;
support and cooperation from our shareholders and partners, as well as colleagues&#13;
&#13;
across the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
     I am pleased to present this annual report, which gives a more complete&#13;
&#13;
picture of IFC's activities and results than ever before. We have integrated our&#13;
&#13;
financial reporting with information on our advisory services, our work with&#13;
&#13;
partners, and our efforts to promote sustainability through investments and&#13;
&#13;
advisory services. We are also providing extensive new data on the development&#13;
&#13;
effectiveness of our activities, which I believe tells a compelling story about the role&#13;
&#13;
of the private sector in growth, job creation, and human development.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC's market is evolving. In the past, IFC mainly provided financing to firms&#13;
&#13;
from industrialized countries as they invested in emerging markets, and this work&#13;
&#13;
was a relatively small part of World Bank Group activity. Today, nearly two-thirds of&#13;
&#13;
our client firms are based in emerging markets, and there is wide acknowledgment&#13;
&#13;
that the private sector plays a critical role in addressing the needs of people in&#13;
&#13;
developing countries. Many of the firms we invest in are also expanding into other&#13;
&#13;
emerging markets, bringing capital, technology, management expertise, and jobs.&#13;
&#13;
We finance more than 20 such "South-South" transactions each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007     5 5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         We are also transforming IFC's operations. Today just over              efits of private sector growth. Poor infrastructure impairs such&#13;
&#13;
      half our workforce is based in field offices and better posi-              basic services as clean water, reliable electricity, and health care.&#13;

&#13;
      ers, IFC is energetically pursuing opportunities even in higher-           struggle to obtain financing and face burdensome regulations.&#13;
&#13;
      risk emerging markets. This approach has helped us achieve                 Throughout the developing world, the environment, corporate&#13;
&#13;
      strong profitability, and that in turn lets IFC reinvest where the         governance, and social issues all pose challenges to a private&#13;
&#13;
      needs are greatest. Beyond financing, we continue to increase              sector seeking to become competitive and meet international&#13;
&#13;
      our advisory services, more and more of which lead to IFC                  standards.&#13;

      investments or are delivered alongside financing. This work                   IFC is able to play a bigger role and tackle these challenges&#13;
&#13;
      allows us to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients'               because we have made a strategic decision to take a larger&#13;
&#13;
      business needs.                                                            number of well-managed risks. We are increasing our equity&#13;
&#13;
         Despite strong growth and capital flows, challenges remain              and quasi-equity investments, especially in markets where&#13;
&#13;
      in emerging markets, and these are driving IFC's strategy.                 others are unable or reluctant to bear the risk. We are using in-&#13;
&#13;
      Many millions of people in smaller, less developed markets and             novative products in higher-risk and underserved markets, such&#13;
&#13;
      in conflict-affected countries have not yet shared in the ben-             as local currency financing that lets companies concentrate&#13;

IFC works with the private sector in&#13;
&#13;
emerging markets. This is a good business&#13;
&#13;
proposition for investors--and it is having&#13;
&#13;
a positive impact on the neediest people&#13;
&#13;
and places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's vision is that poor people have the opportunity to escape poverty and to&#13;
&#13;
improve their lives. By promoting open and competitive markets and providing&#13;
&#13;
investment and advisory support to private sector clients, we seek to create&#13;
&#13;
opportunities for progress in emerging markets. These opportunities take many&#13;
&#13;
forms: productive and profitable enterprises, new or better jobs, innovative&#13;
&#13;
products and services, lower prices, and new tax revenues that fund public&#13;
&#13;
programs. They allow people to work, prosper, and live better and longer lives.&#13;
&#13;
     The private sector plays a key role in the sustainable development of any&#13;
&#13;
economy. Private markets drive growth in productivity, creating jobs and raising&#13;
&#13;
incomes. Private initiative is also critical in expanding the basic services--&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure, health, and education--that empower poor people and create the&#13;
&#13;
conditions for sustained improvements in everyday life.&#13;
&#13;
     More and more governments have put the private sector at the center of&#13;
&#13;
their development strategies. Developing countries are growing faster than ever,&#13;
&#13;
with international capital flows reaching record highs. An increasing number of&#13;
&#13;
governments are reforming the laws and regulations that underpin private sector&#13;
&#13;
activity, bringing down barriers to initiative and growth. In this promising climate,&#13;
&#13;
IFC can focus more than ever on how we add value--making our engagements&#13;
&#13;
broader, developing new investment products, and enhancing the quality of our&#13;
&#13;
advisory work.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    IEG 2007 REPORT: RESULTS, LESSONS, AND IMPLICATIONS FROM 10 YEARS&#13;
&#13;
    OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION&#13;
&#13;
    This year, a new IEG report looked back on 10 years of evaluating IFC's development results. The review found a&#13;
&#13;
    good overall result, that 59 percent of investments (65 percent by volume) evaluated between 1996 and 2006&#13;
&#13;
    achieved high development ratings--they were, on balance, delivering sustainable results across financial, eco-&#13;
&#13;
    nomic, environmental, and social performance, as well as contributing to private sector development generally.&#13;
&#13;
    The report underscores that profitability and development impact usually go hand in hand, and that our develop-&#13;
&#13;
    ment impact is further enhanced when we work with repeat clients. It also underlines the critical importance the&#13;
&#13;
    quality of IFC's own project execution and supervision (particularly of environmental and social effects) for our&#13;
&#13;
    development results.&#13;
&#13;
      The report generally endorses IFC's strategic directions, but also provides guidance for coming years. It recom-&#13;
&#13;
    mends that IFC adopt more tailored, sharply focused country strategies, especially for middle-income countries,&#13;
&#13;
    as well as strengthen cooperation with the World Bank in key areas such as business environment and financial&#13;
&#13;
    sector work, infrastructure development, and environmental and social impact.&#13;

   IFC's goal is to have an ESRR for all investment projects that have&#13;

potential adverse environmental and social impacts and have passed their             Health and Safety Guidelines on April 30, 2007, which offer&#13;

    ASCERTAINING COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR COMPLEX PROJECTS&#13;
&#13;
    To ensure the support of the local people their projects will affect, IFC's clients are required to undertake free, prior, and informed con-&#13;
&#13;
    sultation wherever communities are subject to risks or adverse impacts as the result of a new IFC investment project. In such cases--and&#13;
&#13;
    before seeking Board approval of the project--IFC verifies that the process has enabled the informed participation of the affected com-&#13;
&#13;
    munities and has led to broad community support for the project. Such consultations were required in seven instances during FY07: two&#13;
&#13;
    category A and five category B projects.&#13;

        IFC OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS BY PRODUCT LINE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's financial products and advisory&#13;
&#13;
services go beyond those that developing&#13;
&#13;
country markets and private investors can&#13;
&#13;
provide on their own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC is the largest provider of multilateral financing for the private sector in the&#13;
&#13;
developing world. In FY07, IFC invested $8.2 billion for our own account and&#13;
&#13;
mobilized an additional $3.9 billion through loan participations, structured&#13;
&#13;
finance, and parallel loans. Altogether, we supported 299 investments in 69&#13;
&#13;
countries, typically funding about 25 percent of the total project cost. We also&#13;
&#13;
approved 349 new advisory projects in 84 countries; total expenditures for&#13;
&#13;
advisory services were $197 million.&#13;
&#13;
     Our operations create opportunity for progress in developing regions&#13;
&#13;
and sectors and contribute to economic, financial, environmental, and social&#13;
&#13;
sustainability. This year, 38 percent of our investments were in frontier countries,&#13;
&#13;
and there was strong growth across all of our product lines. Guarantees, primarily&#13;
&#13;
for trade finance and structured finance, registered the largest increase on our&#13;
&#13;
balance sheet (69 percent), followed by equity investments (37 percent). New&#13;
&#13;
loans increased 13 percent to our largest-ever volume of $5.6 billion, while loan&#13;
&#13;
participations grew 12 percent to $1.8 billion. Our resource mobilization increased&#13;
&#13;
by over $1 billion (36 percent) compared to FY06.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC has been consistently profitable since 1956, and our financial results reflect&#13;
&#13;
the success and growth of enterprises in emerging markets around the world.&#13;

LOCAL CURRENCY FINANCING&#13;
&#13;
IFC uses local currency financing to help clients mitigate&#13;
&#13;
foreign exchange risk and to develop local capital&#13;
&#13;
markets. Using market-based instruments, we provide&#13;
&#13;
financing in several forms: loans in local currency, risk&#13;
&#13;
management swaps that allow clients to hedge foreign&#13;
&#13;
currency liabilities back into local currency, and credit&#13;
&#13;
enhancement structures that enable clients to borrow in&#13;
&#13;
local currency from other sources.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC is an organization with truly global&#13;
&#13;
reach, serving all developing regions.&#13;
&#13;
We focus not on where the business is&#13;
&#13;
easiest, but on places where we can make&#13;
&#13;
the biggest difference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal year 2007 saw strong growth in new investment commitments for developing&#13;
&#13;
regions, with corresponding expansion in our advisory work. In financing for IFC's&#13;
&#13;
account, South Asia registered the largest increase (over 110 percent), followed by&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa (97 percent). In both of these regions, over 90 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
new investments are in frontier countries, reflecting our commitment to reach more&#13;
&#13;
of the neediest people and places. Commitments for the Middle East and North&#13;
&#13;
Africa also grew significantly, with an 82 percent increase over FY06. The largest&#13;
&#13;
share of commitments went to Europe and Central Asia (22 percent), Latin America&#13;
&#13;
and the Caribbean (22 percent), and Sub-Saharan Africa (17 percent).&#13;
&#13;
    Our advisory services continued to grow throughout the regions, with the&#13;
&#13;
largest shares of our $197 million in expenditures going to Sub-Saharan Africa (23&#13;
&#13;
percent) and Europe and Central Asia (20 percent). Over half our expenditures on&#13;
&#13;
advisory services in these regions went to frontier countries.&#13;
&#13;
    We have made significant progress in measuring our development impact and&#13;
&#13;
the sustainability of our investment and advisory projects across the regions. The&#13;
&#13;
share of our tracked investments with successful development results has been&#13;
&#13;
most encouraging in Europe and Central Asia, with a 76 percent success rate, and&#13;
&#13;
in South Asia, at 73 percent. These compare to an IFC average of 63 percent across&#13;
&#13;
the regions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC brings global expertise to the private&#13;
&#13;
sector in a wide range of industries.&#13;
&#13;
We offer innovative products and&#13;
&#13;
approaches to funding, and we help&#13;
&#13;
companies upgrade environmental and&#13;
&#13;
social performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC investments continue to grow in many industries, increasingly alongside&#13;
&#13;
advisory work that helps companies, for example, upgrade environmental and&#13;
&#13;
social performance, improve corporate governance, meet regulatory standards,&#13;
&#13;
build links with local suppliers, or improve relations with their community.&#13;
&#13;
     Among departments focusing on IFC's strategic sectors, Health and Education&#13;
&#13;
registered the largest increase in FY07 (58 percent), followed by Agribusiness (38&#13;
&#13;
percent), and Global Financial Markets (37 percent), based on financing for IFC's&#13;
&#13;
account. Departments with the largest shares of commitments include Global&#13;
&#13;
Financial Markets (41 percent); Global Manufacturing and Services (17 percent);&#13;
&#13;
Oil, Gas, Mining, and Chemicals (12 percent); and Infrastructure (11 percent). Part&#13;
&#13;
of the growth in new commitments for financial markets (over $900 million) can&#13;
&#13;
be attributed to the IFC Global Trade Finance Program's more than $750 million in&#13;
&#13;
guarantees for trade transactions, almost half of which benefited banks in Sub-&#13;
&#13;
Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
     We have made significant progress in measuring our development impact and&#13;
&#13;
the sustainability of our investment and advisory projects across industries. The&#13;
&#13;
share of our tracked investments with successful development results has been&#13;
&#13;
most encouraging in Infrastructure and Global Financial Markets, each with a 78&#13;
&#13;
percent success rate, and in Oil, Gas, Mining, and Chemicals, at 76 percent. These&#13;
&#13;
compare to an IFC average of 63 percent across industry departments.&#13;

&#13;
supported a number of projects that have not&#13;
&#13;
been commercially successful, as well as some&#13;
&#13;
difficult years in global markets. Our experience&#13;
&#13;
demonstrates better results with nonperishable&#13;
&#13;
products (beverages, grains, oilseeds, sugar) and&#13;
&#13;
with agribusiness infrastructure than with animal&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
&#13;
Agribusiness companies increasingly recognize&#13;
&#13;
that the sector relies on a healthy base of natural&#13;
&#13;
resources, many of which are at risk. The sector&#13;
&#13;
also faces social challenges, including the need to&#13;
&#13;
raise labor standards. IFC seeks commercially&#13;
&#13;
viable solutions and helps companies set&#13;
&#13;
benchmarks of responsible production so that&#13;
&#13;
these solutions become widely adopted. In such&#13;
&#13;
areas as sequestering carbon, managing&#13;
&#13;
watersheds, preserving biodiversity, and&#13;
&#13;
producing renewable energy resources, this work&#13;
&#13;
can also help generate new income through envi-&#13;
&#13;
ronmental services. This year we helped ECOM&#13;
&#13;
Agroindustrial Corporation raise environmental&#13;
&#13;
and social practices among its coffee suppliers in&#13;
&#13;
Central America; the aim is to help them gain&#13;
&#13;
premium prices for more sustainable products&#13;
&#13;
while lowering operational costs and enhancing&#13;
&#13;
productivity. The project seeks to move the&#13;
&#13;
broader supply chain to exceed minimum&#13;
&#13;
compliance standards.&#13;

IFC is helping raise clients' awareness of                Brazil's natural geographic advantages place it well to help meet growing global demand for foodstuffs, including&#13;
environmental and social sustainability, and              through soybean and cattle production. The country's expanding activity in these sectors, however, brings itunder&#13;
companies that aspire to a high level of social           heightened scrutiny because of the risk they can pose to the Amazon. For the Amaggi soybean project and the&#13;
responsibility increasingly seek our assistance. We       Bertin cattle project, we have helped companies respond to concerns about their environmental and social&#13;

DEVELOPMENT RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
IFC began investing in health and education in&#13;
&#13;
the late 1990s; hence we have only a small&#13;
&#13;
sample of projects that are sufficiently mature to&#13;
&#13;
assess the overall impact. The development&#13;
&#13;
results of these early projects have been weak,&#13;
&#13;
mainly due to problems with project sponsors.&#13;
&#13;
We have, however, gained significant global&#13;
&#13;
expertise in appraising projects and are better&#13;
&#13;
able to advise clients on the content and scope&#13;
&#13;
of their projects. We are adapting by providing&#13;
&#13;
more advisory services, conducting better project&#13;

DEVELOPMENT RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
Subnational finance is a relatively new line of&#13;
&#13;
business for IFC; operations are not yet&#13;
&#13;
sufficiently mature to evaluate their results fully.&#13;
&#13;
One early example is the IFC-funded Bus Rapid&#13;
&#13;
Transit system in Guatemala City, which has&#13;
&#13;
reduced commuting times and increased the&#13;
&#13;
availability and safety of public transportation.&#13;
&#13;
Our local currency loan to Russia's Chuvash&#13;
&#13;
Republic will provide all-weather access to&#13;
&#13;
markets and services for rural communities and&#13;
&#13;
help the republic extend the life of its existing&#13;
&#13;
road assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
&#13;
Since local governments are usually responsible&#13;
&#13;
for providing water, sewerage, and solid waste&#13;
&#13;
services, many of the subnational projects we&#13;
&#13;
finance result in positive environmental and social&#13;
&#13;
impacts. For example, this year IFC made a $50&#13;
&#13;
million investment in PNOC-EDC, an integrated&#13;
&#13;
geothermal steam and electricity producer in the&#13;
&#13;
Philippines. This will enable development of new&#13;
&#13;
energy projects and lower the country's&#13;
&#13;
dependence on imported fossil fuels. The project&#13;
&#13;
is also expected to improve the efficiency and&#13;
&#13;
competitiveness of the country's geothermal&#13;
&#13;
sector. IFC is helping the company improve its&#13;
&#13;
corporate governance and social environmental&#13;
&#13;
risk management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED, AND&#13;
WORK STILL TO BE DONE&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC advises businesses and governments&#13;
&#13;
to support the private sector. Especially&#13;
&#13;
in frontier markets, this helps us address&#13;
&#13;
basic challenges and prepare the way for&#13;
&#13;
private investment and growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC Advisory Services is a growing and dynamic business. This part of our work&#13;
&#13;
has grown nearly 30 percent a year, reaching $197 million this year. By design,&#13;
&#13;
advisory projects are less sensitive to many of the risks that constrain IFC's&#13;
&#13;
investment work. Those same risks also contribute to the demand that makes&#13;
&#13;
advisory services the lead instrument for IFC in many countries.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is working to integrate advisory work more closely with investments.&#13;
&#13;
We are also enhancing coordination with the World Bank, which leads in&#13;
&#13;
providing broader policy advice to governments in such critical sectors as&#13;
&#13;
financial market development and reform of the infrastructure sectors.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC had advisory work active in 97 countries during FY07, and projects in&#13;
&#13;
frontier countries represent 62 percent of the value of new approvals. Of the&#13;
&#13;
35 conflict-affected member countries, IFC has advisory projects committed in&#13;
&#13;
23, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, Nigeria, and Rwanda. Advisory Services&#13;
&#13;
employs over 1,100 full time staff, a 125 percent net growth since FY02.&#13;
&#13;
     The work is organized into five business lines: Business Enabling&#13;

          joint product of IFC and the World Bank, it has inspired 109 reforms, 53 of which are complete and yielding benefits to&#13;
          businesses. A third are taking place in Africa, which Doing Business 2007 identified as the region with the sharpest increase&#13;

     INTEGRATING ADVISORY SERVICES WITH INVESTMENTS&#13;
     About half of IFC's investments are with finance institutions that serve small businesses, and over 70 percent of our advisory&#13;
     services focus on these clients. As of December 2006, IFC's clients held about 5 million small business loans worth over $57&#13;
     billion. IFC's strategy is to integrate investment and advisory work through efforts that began in Africa in 2005-2006, ex-&#13;
     panded to Latin America last year, and are now spreading to Asia. An independent evaluation recently found that from 2003&#13;
     to 2006 IFC achieved greater outreach when investment and advisory services were provided as a combined service to clients.&#13;

          GOING GLOBAL WITH CLEAN, AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER&#13;
          One important way IFC measures success is by replicating and expanding initiatives in which we played a defining role. In 2002,&#13;
          a start-up company with a robust, energy-efficient, and low-cost water purification technology approached IFC for funding. We&#13;
          provided advice and funding that helped the company redefine its approach from selling equipment to selling water. Today, 500&#13;
          WaterHealth International systems deliver clean water to an estimated 500,000 people in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and rural&#13;
          India. These businesses are staffed by villagers and funded by local banks. Users pay just $2 a year for clean water. WaterHealth&#13;
          International recently raised $11.3 million with new investors and is poised to accelerate its expansion.&#13;

   PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS&#13;
   Many developing countries are establishing innovative partnerships, combining elements of private capital and expertise&#13;
   with well-defined and limited public funding, to address bottlenecks and infrastructure and deliver essential public services.&#13;
   IFC's ability to tap both our global experience in infrastructure and the public policy expertise of the World Bank positions us&#13;
   uniquely to support member countries in developing these solutions. This support comes both through IFC investments in&#13;
   public-private partnerships and through our advisory work for developing, tendering, and implementing such arrangements.&#13;
   IFC has over 30 ongoing advisory mandates to help government implement PPPs, with Africa and the Middle East being the&#13;
   most active regions. In FY07, we concluded eight such mandates, which are expected to lead to $1.5 billion in investment.&#13;

          HELPING LOCAL BUSINESSES ACCESS E-PROCUREMENT&#13;
          In December 2005, ExxonMobil turned to IFC for support in expanding its e-procurement system, an initiative to reach local&#13;
          suppliers. IFC used its Enterprise Center in Chad, a program developed in partnership with the local chamber of commerce,&#13;
          to address poor Internet access, low computer literacy, and language barriers. To date, 53 local firms have submitted bids&#13;
          resulting in 16 contracts worth over $30 million. The e-procurement effort is part of a larger local business opportunity proj-&#13;
          ect that includes assessment of potential suppliers, training, and mentorship. The results of this partnership are promising:&#13;
          the average local contract has grown from $100,000 in 2004 to $800,000 in 2007.&#13;

IFC works with a wide range of partners and through many different channels to&#13;

maximize our impact on private sector development. We value the skills, experiences,&#13;
&#13;
and insights that each of our partners brings to the table. By collaborating, we&#13;
&#13;
maximize the positive impact of our work as well as pool and leverage resources, all&#13;
&#13;
while capitalizing on the competitive advantages of each partner.&#13;
&#13;
     We strive to demonstrate to all of our partners how funds are being invested&#13;
&#13;
and what results these investments bring. Proper measurement of results also&#13;
&#13;
improves program design and implementation. IFC employs the latest thinking and&#13;
&#13;
approaches in evaluation methodology, and we benchmark our activities against&#13;
&#13;
the leaders in the field.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A concern for people--stakeholders, local&#13;
&#13;
communities, employees and their famillies--&#13;
&#13;
is fundamental to good business, at IFC and&#13;
&#13;
in our client companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In IFC's line of business--creating opportunity through private sector development--&#13;
&#13;
diligence, responsibility, and passion define business results. Success comes&#13;
&#13;
from commitment to best practice in every aspect of our operations, be it in our&#13;
&#13;
governance, accountability to our stakeholders, our focus on sustainability, or&#13;
&#13;
investment in our staff.&#13;
&#13;
     Managing our diverse and expanding operations effectively requires sound&#13;
&#13;
organizational structures and principles: good governance and leadership within IFC&#13;
&#13;
and in cooperation across the World Bank Group; attention to detail in monitoring&#13;
&#13;
and evaluating our investments and advisory services throughout their life cycle;&#13;
&#13;
and dedication to working responsibly with clients and other stakeholders to ensure&#13;
&#13;
transparency, accountability for our actions, and a commitment to continuous&#13;
&#13;
improvement.&#13;
&#13;
     Sustainability is central to our business strategy and a vital part of our operations&#13;
&#13;
in offices worldwide. Managing our environmental and social footprint in our day-&#13;
&#13;
to-day activities is an important part of living our mission and being consistent with&#13;
&#13;
what we ask of our clients.&#13;
&#13;
     Above all, converting our work into significant development impact happens&#13;
&#13;
because of the people at IFC. We are committed to recruiting, rewarding, and&#13;
&#13;
training the best and most dedicated staff. By mobilizing our most valuable&#13;
&#13;
resource, our people, we continuously push for greater impact in reducing poverty&#13;
&#13;
and improving lives.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         WORKING ACROSS THE WORLD BANK GROUP&#13;
&#13;
         Effective coordination and cooperation with our fellow organizations in the World Bank Group--the World Bank and&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA--is a key corporate goal for IFC. This allows IFC to play an integrated role in delivering on broader World Bank Group&#13;
&#13;
         objectives, supporting growth and alleviating poverty. We also benefit from synergies with our Bank Group counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
            Coordination begins at the strategic level, as we increasingly work with the World Bank on joint Country Assistance Strat-&#13;
&#13;
         egies. At the advisory and project level, we coordinate in such critical areas as business environment reform; public-private&#13;
&#13;
         partnerships to improve and expand the delivery of basic services, including water and sanitation, energy, education, and&#13;
&#13;
         health; and financial market development. In Lima, for example, work by the Bank on land registries is complemented by&#13;
&#13;
         IFC's detailed advisory work and financing to support development of mortgage finance markets.&#13;
&#13;
            IFC can play an investment role in a number of sectors where World Bank engagement focuses on policy. Reflecting these&#13;
&#13;
         complementary roles, IFC and World Bank staff work side by side in several units:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The joint Bank/IFC/MIGA vice presidency focuses on financial and private sector development, in which we collaborate&#13;
&#13;
           to strengthen the business environment, enhance SMEs' access to finance, and improve corporate governance. This vice&#13;
&#13;
           presidency houses the IFC/Bank Doing Business project and FIAS, a joint IFC/Bank/MIGA advisory service, which together&#13;
&#13;
           play key roles in business environment reform, documenting challenges and helping governments address them.&#13;
&#13;
           Joint IFC/World Bank departments focus on information and communication technologies and on oil, gas, mining,&#13;
&#13;
           and chemicals.&#13;
&#13;
           A new joint subnational finance department focuses on investments in key infrastructure sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         We recognize that where there are synergies there can also be conflicts of interest--and we manage this risk through a&#13;
&#13;
         mechanism modeled on best practice from the private sector.&#13;

&#13;
as well as for our clients. We have developed internal processes&#13;
&#13;

    HOW WE ARE CHANGING&#13;
&#13;
     We are growing. IFC's staff increased by 51 percent from FY02          k Staff representation from developing countries, at officer&#13;
&#13;
     to FY07, from 2,068 to 3,134 staff. The core job stream of                level and higher, increased from 42 to 50 percent&#13;
&#13;
     investment staff represents 18 percent of IFC's workforce and          k Officer-level female staff increased from 38 to 41 percent&#13;
&#13;
     has increased by 77 percent, from 325 to 576 staff, since FY02.        k Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean regional representation&#13;
&#13;
     The fastest-growing areas of IFC's business, advisory services,           of staff on international contracts: increased from 7 to 9&#13;
&#13;
     has grown from 405 staff in FY02 to 1,073 in FY07, and it now             percent, the equivalent of 36 net staff members&#13;
&#13;
     accounts for 34 percent of the workforce.&#13;
&#13;
        We are going local. IFC's workforce profile is substantially           One key challenge is retention of staff whose knowledge&#13;
&#13;
     different from six years ago. The decentralization of IFC staffing     and experience are highly valued in the global marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
     is not new; it started to increase gradually in FY01. The number       The competition for skilled finance and investment talent in&#13;

     years, from 98 to 276 staff, with 48 percent of IFC's investment       rising as a result. Hence IFC's turnover of investment officers is&#13;
&#13;
     staff and 51 percent of managers in investment departments             now 7.7 percent a year, up from 3.5 percent in FY05. Some 39&#13;
&#13;
     now based in the field. About 870 advisory service staff, more         percent of investment officers hired at entry level in fiscal years&#13;
&#13;
     than 80 percent, are based in the field.                               1998 to 2001 have already left IFC.&#13;
&#13;
        IFC's large-scale recruitment drive in the last two years has&#13;
&#13;
     allowed us to strengthen and diversify our talent pool--and&#13;
&#13;
     diversity of staff is a key priority for IFC. As a result of FY06-07&#13;
&#13;
     recruitment efforts, IFC substantially improved diversity in the&#13;
&#13;
     profile of selected staff on whom the Board has asked us to&#13;

     report. (The following figures are limited to professional-level&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
IFC has commissioned The Corporate Citizenship Company to provide IFC's&#13;
management with external assurance and commentary on certain nonfinancial&#13;
aspects of its 2007 Annual Report, specifically the portions contained in pages nine&#13;
to 96, described below, that are intended to address sustainability and development&#13;
outcome results. IFC's management has prepared the report and is solely&#13;
responsible for its content. Our objectives were to review specific aspects of its&#13;
content and presentation as identified below, to conduct selected checks of&#13;
underlying corporate records, and to provide this statement, for which we have sole&#13;
responsibility, all in accordance with instructions from IFC's management and the&#13;
terms of reference we signed with IFC. We also tested the Development Outcome&#13;
Tracking System (DOTS) that IFC uses for assessment of the economic, social, and&#13;
environmental effects of its investments and advisory services.&#13;

&#13;
Our opinion&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, having reviewed relevant underlying IFC systems, the sustainability&#13;
and development outcome aspects of the Annual Report provide a fair and balanced&#13;
representation of the progress IFC is making in carrying out its stated commitments,&#13;
as set forth in the text sections "IFC's Contribution to Development" and "Our&#13;
Strategic Approach." We have relied entirely on data and information provided by&#13;
IFC, except where we expressly state to the contrary in our note on the assurance&#13;
process, published on IFC's Web site. Where we have identified material gaps in&#13;
available performance data and stakeholder views, these are noted below in our&#13;
Commentary. In reviewing DOTS, described on page 16, nothing came to our&#13;
attention to suggest that the methodology agreed by the multilateral development&#13;
banks (referred to on page 18) had not been applied, nor that information had been&#13;
materially misstated.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
      In forming our opinion and making our comments, we have referred to the&#13;
      principles underlying the international assurance standard AA1000&#13;
      (www.accountability21.net), notably those concerning materiality, completeness,&#13;
      and responsiveness. We have also referred to the reporting guidance for content&#13;
      and the principles for defining quality contained in GRI's G3 sustainability reporting&#13;
      guidelines (www.globalreporting.org). Our methodology for testing the DOTS system&#13;
      is presented in our note on the assurance process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Commentary&#13;
&#13;
      IFC has chosen for the first time to combine its sustainability report and its report to&#13;
      donors within its annual report to demonstrate the centrality of sustainable&#13;
      development, including development outcomes, to IFC's objectives and strategies.&#13;
      We believe that this approach, when further refined, could be considered a model&#13;
      for other institutions or companies that are seeking to present sustainability&#13;
      considerations as being core to their businesses.&#13;
&#13;
      Such reports should explain how an institution impacts society, taking account of the&#13;
      key economic, social, and environmental concerns of its stakeholders. Reports&#13;
      should show how crucial decisions are made and differing interests balanced. They&#13;
      should be honest about shortcomings. On this basis, we believe the sustainability&#13;
      aspects of IFC's fully integrated 2007 Annual Report, together with IFC's efforts to&#13;
      report on the development outcomes of its activities, mark a step forward from the&#13;
      previous sustainability report for fiscal year 2005.&#13;
&#13;
      As IFC's internal systems for monitoring environmental and social impacts and&#13;
      supervising projects, including the DOTS development indicators, are embedded&#13;
      and strengthened, we would expect the quality of data and indicators to improve&#13;
      year on year.&#13;
&#13;
      On page 20, IFC has made progress in meeting its 2005 commitment to report on&#13;
      the implementation of its Performance Standards, and on its Web site, which is&#13;
      outside the scope of this assurance, it is making steps toward reporting the volume&#13;
      of business to which individual standards are being applied. We welcome IFC's&#13;
      commitment to begin publishing the carbon footprint of its portfolio, as stated on&#13;
      page 14.&#13;
&#13;
      IFC cannot report on projects in detail for reasons of client confidentiality. However,&#13;
      we believe the sustainability aspects would be more comprehensive if the report&#13;
      detailed IFC and its clients' approaches to managing challenging projects during the&#13;
      year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98   IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IFC regularly requires or recommends that clients for its investments and advisory&#13;
services undertake stakeholder engagement, and our research has found IFC itself&#13;
to be responsive to a wide range of stakeholders. However, we believe IFC's&#13;
responsiveness would be better reflected if this report addressed more directly the&#13;
views of diverse stakeholders. For example, some audiences may not readily accept&#13;
IFC's view that private sector investment automatically benefits development,&#13;
particularly in such sectors as oil, gas and chemicals or the private provision of&#13;
education and water.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion the materiality of the content is strong, reflecting that IFC's greatest&#13;
impacts are generated through its investments and advisory services. However, this&#13;
report aspires to follow the Global Reporting Initiative, and it would be both more in&#13;
keeping with the GRI guidelines and more complete if it were to cover in greater&#13;
detail IFC's own operational impacts. For example, it should provide more data on&#13;
employee and community engagement, detail compliance with World Bank Group&#13;
policies on integrity and corruption, and discuss procurement processes.&#13;

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION&#13;
AND ANALYSIS of Financial&#13;
Condition and Results of Operations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I. OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an international organization, established in 1956, to further economic growth in its&#13;
developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also&#13;
comprises the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It is&#13;
a legal entity separate and distinct from IBRD, IDA, MIGA, and ICSID, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial&#13;
structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of IBRD. As of June 30, 2007, IFC's entire&#13;
share capital was held by 179 member countries.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's principal investment products are loans and equity investments, with relatively small debt securities and guarantee portfolios.&#13;
IFC also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or&#13;
through loan participations, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance, corporate lending and resource&#13;
mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial products and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world&#13;
to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of&#13;
private enterprise and foreign investment. Unlike most multilateral development institutions, IFC does not accept host government&#13;
guarantees of its exposures. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance of debt obligations in&#13;
the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with IBRD. Equity investments are funded from net&#13;
worth. During the year ended June 30, 2007 (FY07), IFC had an authorized borrowing program of up to $3.5 billion, including&#13;
$500 million to allow for possible prefunding during FY07 of the funding program for the year to June 30, 2008 (FY08).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in US dollars. IFC seeks to minimize foreign exchange and&#13;
interest rate risks by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies with assets having&#13;
the same characteristics. IFC manages any residual currency and interest rate risks by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps and&#13;
other derivative instruments.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                      IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007             101101&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Basis of preparation of IFC's consolidated financial statements&#13;
&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of IFC conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP).&#13;
&#13;
Up to and including the year ended June 30, 1999, IFC prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with&#13;
both US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, principally due to material differences between US&#13;
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as&#13;
amended (collectively SFAS No. 133), and its counterpart in IFRS, IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement,&#13;
it has not been possible for IFC to satisfy the requirements of both US GAAP and IFRS via one set of financial statements since the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
IFC is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of its consolidated&#13;
financial statements, all with a view to the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of business. IFC plans to&#13;
change presentation of its consolidated financial statements from US GAAP to IFRS in the year ending June 30, 2010.&#13;
&#13;
Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to income after (i) expenditures for advisory service&#13;
(referred to as technical assistance and advisory services, or TAAS, prior to FY07; (ii) expenditures for performance-based grants&#13;
(PBG); and (iii) grants to IDA (operating income). Operating income excludes the effects of net gains (losses) on non-trading&#13;
financial instruments pursuant to SFAS No. 133. The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income are discussed in Section VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial performance summary&#13;
&#13;
From year to year, IFC's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally income (dividends and realized capital&#13;
gains) generated from its equity investment portfolio; the magnitude of provisions for losses against its loans and guarantees;&#13;
impairment of equity investments; loans in nonaccrual status; and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status. A&#13;
significant part of IFC's liquid assets trading portfolio is invested in fixed income securities, which are also subject to external market&#13;
factors that affect the value of such securities, adding variability to operating income. Net income also includes net gains and losses&#13;
on non-trading financial instruments, pursuant to SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has been profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY07 of $2,611 million, as compared with&#13;
$1,409 million for the year ended June 30, 2006 (FY06), and $1,953 million for the year ended June 30, 2005 (FY05). Operating&#13;
income in FY07 was a record high for IFC, reflecting strong contributions across each of IFC's main product lines: loans, equities,&#13;
debt securities and treasury operations. IFC reported net income in FY07, including the effects of SFAS No. 133, of $2,618 million,&#13;
as compared with $1,278 million for FY06 and $2,015 million for FY05.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's operating income for the past five fiscal years ended June 30 is presented below:&#13;

III. CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
Business overview&#13;
&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector&#13;
enterprises by making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to&#13;
bring together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby create conditions conducive to the&#13;
flow of private capital (domestic and foreign) into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this way, IFC plays&#13;
a catalytic role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders, through parallel loans, loan participations, partial&#13;
credit guarantees, securitizations and risk sharing facilities (resource mobilization). In addition to project finance, corporate lending&#13;
and resource mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial products and technical advisory services to private businesses in the&#13;
developing world with a view to fulfilling its developmental mission. IFC also advises member governments on how to create an&#13;
environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in&#13;
productive private enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the&#13;
public sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control&#13;
in a market context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's main investment activity is project and corporate financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and&#13;
modernizations. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing investment programs. In addition,&#13;
IFC facilitates financing through financial intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and specialized lending&#13;
products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFC's borrower, on-lending&#13;
to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
IFC applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, additionality, and developmental impact in determining the&#13;
eligibility of projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
Advisory services&#13;
IFC has historically delivered its mission primarily through loans, equity investments, and debt securities. As a result of an enhanced&#13;
focus on frontier markets and achievement of sustainable development impact, the demands on IFC for associated advisory work&#13;
have increased significantly. In FY04, IFC established a funding mechanism for advisory services, funded by designations of IFC's&#13;
retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
Amounts available to be designated for advisory services are determined based on IFC's annual operating income in excess of $150&#13;
million, contemplating the financial capacity and priorities of IFC, and are approved by IFC's Board of Directors. Expenditures for&#13;
the various approved advisory services projects are recorded as expenses in IFC's consolidated income statement in the year in&#13;
which they occur, and have the effect of reducing retained earnings designated for this specific purpose. Prior to FY07, IFC's Board&#13;
of Directors had approved designations of $580 million of IFC's retained earnings. IFC incurred expenditures for advisory services&#13;
of $38 million in FY05, $55 million in FY06, and $96 million in FY07, thereby reducing the amount of retained earnings designated&#13;
for advisory services at June 30, 2007, to $391 million. Additional information on the funding mechanism for advisory services can&#13;
be found in Notes A and N to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Performance-based grants&#13;
In FY05, IFC began the analysis to create a program to fund performance-based grants, targeted at specific industries in developing&#13;
countries, particularly frontier areas. The performance-based grants initiative (PBGI) establishes a pool of resources for funding&#13;
performance-based grants to individual private-sector projects in developing markets. The PBGI furthers IFC's frontier strategy by&#13;
opening new opportunities to generate developmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
The initiative had been discussed by IFC's Board of Directors during the second half of FY05 but no decisions on the principles or&#13;
modalities of the initiative were made at that time. As a result, IFC designated $250 million of retained earnings for the initiative,&#13;
with further deliberations to occur in FY06 on the principles and specifics of the initiative. On March 30, 2006, IFC's Board of&#13;
Directors approved an implementation mechanism for the initiative and an initial pilot phase of $65 million. During FY06, IFC&#13;
provided $35 million to IBRD's Global Partnership on Output Based Aid under the pilot phase; this amount was recorded as an&#13;
expense in FY06. There were no expenditures in FY07. The amount of retained earnings designated for performance-based grants&#13;
at June 30, 2007 was $215 million.&#13;

Grants to IDA&#13;
In order to encourage the growth of productive private enterprise in countries that are members of both IFC and IDA, on August 7,&#13;
2006, IFC's Board of Directors approved the designation of $150 million to IDA. On February 27, 2007, IFC disbursed $150 million&#13;
in grants to IDA and has recorded an expense of $150 million in its FY07 consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings&#13;
Designations of retained earnings related to FY07 net income are expected to be approved by the Board of Directors during FY08.&#13;
&#13;
Investment process and portfolio supervision&#13;
IFC's investment process can be divided into twelve main stages:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !      Business development                                                          IFC carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance&#13;

with $3.9 billion at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Additional information on IFC's investment portfolio as of and for the years ended June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006, can be found&#13;

Investment products&#13;
&#13;
Loans&#13;
Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 77% of IFC's disbursed investment portfolio as of&#13;
June 30, 2007, compared with 79% at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !    Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
  !    Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Swiss franc and&#13;
       Japanese yen&#13;
  !    Interest rate: typically variable&#13;
  !    Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to&#13;
       the 6-month LIBOR index in the relevant currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC offers local currency loan products to certain clients, provided that IFC is able to hedge its local currency exposure through&#13;
mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and loans in currencies other than US dollars are&#13;
normally transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate loans.&#13;
&#13;
On June 30, 2007, IFC's disbursed loan portfolio was $12.7 billion ($10.7 billion at June 30, 2006). At June 30, 2007, 73% (76%&#13;
at June 30, 2006) of IFC's disbursed loan portfolio, excluding unamortized deferred loan origination fees, net, and the unamortized&#13;
FSAS No. 133 transition adjustment, was US dollar-denominated.&#13;

Debt securities accounted for 4% of IFC's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2007, compared with 1% at June 30, 2006.&#13;
Debt securities are typically in the form of bonds and notes issued in bearer or registered form, securitized debt obligations (e.g.,&#13;
asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other collateralized debt obligations) and preferred shares, which are&#13;
mandatorily redeemable by the issuer or puttable to the issuer by IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional loans, equity investments, and debt securities, IFC provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity&#13;
instruments. Quasi-equities include subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and&#13;
certain common or preferred shares with put and/or call features. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-equities may be&#13;
classified as loans, equity investments, or debt securities in IFC's consolidated balance sheet. At June 30, 2007, IFC's disbursed&#13;
quasi-equity portfolio, before the unamortized SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment, adjustments to investments accounted for&#13;
under the equity method, unrealized gains on equity investments held by consolidated VIEs, and unamortized deferred loan&#13;
origination fees, net, totaled $2,725 million ($1,935 million at June 30, 2006), of which $2,416 million was classified as loans&#13;
($1,768 million at June 30, 2006), $80 million was classified as equity investments ($96 million at June 30, 2006), and $229 million&#13;
was classified as securities ($71 million at June 30, 2006) in IFC's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees and partial credit guarantees&#13;
IFC offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. IFC's&#13;
guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligations of clients and covers commercial as well as noncommercial risks.&#13;
IFC will provide local currency guarantees, but when a guarantee is called, the client will generally be obligated to reimburse IFC in&#13;
US dollar terms. Guarantee fees are consistent with IFC's loan pricing policies. During FY07, IFC signed $1.0 billion of guarantees,&#13;
$0.6 billion in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Resource mobilization&#13;
Resource mobilization is defined as financing from entities other than IFC that becomes available to clients due to IFC's direct&#13;
involvement in raising resources. lFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-&#13;
financed projects, therefore, require other financial partners. IFC mobilizes such private sector finance from other entities through&#13;
participations, parallel loans, partial credit guarantees, securitizations, and risk sharing facilities.&#13;
&#13;
B-loans&#13;
The principal direct means by which IFC mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of participations in its loans (B-&#13;
loans), known as the B-loan program. Through the B-loan program, IFC has worked primarily with commercial banks but also with&#13;
nonbank financial institutions in financing projects since the early 1960s.&#13;
&#13;
Whenever it participates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its&#13;
loan participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the B-loan.&#13;
IFC charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan.&#13;
&#13;
B-loan commitments were $1,775 million in FY07 ($1,572 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
Structured finance&#13;
Structured finance comprises partial credit guarantees, securitizations and risk sharing facilities. Structured finance commitments,&#13;
net, defined as the amount of financing with a risk position equal to, or senior to, that of IFC's risk participation in the transaction,&#13;
totaled $2,083 million in FY07 ($1,245 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
Parallel loans&#13;
Loans from other financial institutions that IFC helped raise for clients and received a fee, but for which IFC is not the lender of&#13;
record, arranged by IFC in FY07 were $29 million ($67 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007           109109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Resource mobilization ratio&#13;
&#13;
The resource mobilization ratio is defined as:&#13;
&#13;
                           Loan participations + parallel loans + non-IFC investment portion of structured finance&#13;
                                    Commitments (IFC investments + IFC portion of structured finance)&#13;
&#13;
For each dollar that IFC committed, IFC mobilized (in the form of B-loans, parallel loans, and the non-IFC portion of structured&#13;
finance) $0.47 in FY07 ($0.43 at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Advisory services&#13;
Advisory services are a growing and dynamic business that allows IFC to carry out its development mission beyond its investment&#13;
activities. Beginning in FY05, IFC established a funding mechanism for advisory services, funded by designations of IFC's retained&#13;
earnings, in order to address its increased efforts in the provision of advisory services. IFC provides such services to promote&#13;
sustainable private sector investment in developing countries. Through this work, which is funded in partnership with governments&#13;
and other donors, IFC contributes to development where opportunities for development may be limited. During FY07, IFC&#13;
organized its advisory services in five business lines that correspond with IFC's operational strategy:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !     Access to Finance: to expand on the availability of financial services to micro and small businesses and low-income&#13;
        households.&#13;
  !     Business Enabling Environment: to enable micro, small, and medium businesses to grow, invest, become more&#13;
        productive, and create jobs.&#13;
  !     Environment and Social Sustainability: to develop innovative business models that deliver social and environmental&#13;
        benefits.&#13;
  !     Infrastructure: to improve access to basic services in road infrastructure, telecommunications, water and energy&#13;
        utilities, health, and education.&#13;
  !     Value Addition to Firms: to help private firms enhance their competitiveness and productivity and to promote the&#13;
        growth of small businesses through the development of supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services totaled $96 million in FY07 ($55 million in FY06 and $38 million in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
The advisory services portfolio at June 30, 2007 included 1,018 projects with approved funding from IFC and donors of $846&#13;
million. Of this, 362 new projects were approved in FY07 with funding of $386 million. The average planned duration of advisory&#13;
service projects now exceeds 24 months. The average size of new projects exceeds $1 million.&#13;
&#13;
During FY07, expenses were incurred in 943 projects (both IFC and donor funds). FY07 exposures by business line and, region are&#13;
as follows:&#13;

Liquid assets&#13;
&#13;
IFC invests its liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, governments,&#13;
government agencies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AAA-rated corporate issuers; these include mortgage-&#13;
and asset-backed securities, time deposits and other unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
IFC manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging techniques including derivatives,&#13;
principally currency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's liquid assets are invested in five separate portfolios, namely P0 through P4.&#13;

The P3 portfolio is not permitted to exceed 12% of the total value of liquid assets at any time.&#13;
&#13;
All portfolios are accounted for as trading portfolios.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has a flexible approach to managing the liquid assets portfolios by making investments on an aggregate portfolio basis against&#13;
its benchmark within specified risk parameters. In implementing these portfolio management strategies, IFC utilizes derivative&#13;
instruments, including futures, and options, and takes long or short positions in securities.&#13;
&#13;
All liquid assets are managed according to an investment authority approved by IFC's Board of Directors and investment guidelines&#13;
approved by IFC's Finance and Risk Committee, a subcommittee of IFC's Management Group.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
IFC's capitalization as of June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, IFC may borrow in the&#13;
public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing&#13;
is denominated. IFC borrowed $2.8 billion during FY07 ($1.8 billion in FY06 and $2.0 billion in FY05). In addition, IFC's Board of&#13;
Directors has authorized the repurchase and/or redemption of debt obligations issued by IFC. During FY07, IFC repurchased and&#13;
retired $16 million of outstanding debt ($209 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Outstanding&#13;
market borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years, with a weighted average&#13;
remaining maturity of 9.8 years at June 30, 2007 (10.7 years at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2007, IFC had&#13;
gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $8.8 billion ($8.5 billion at June 30, 2006) and from borrowing-related&#13;
interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $6.7 billion ($6.7 billion at June 30, 2006). After the effect of these&#13;
derivative instruments is taken into consideration, substantially all of IFC's market borrowings at June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006,&#13;
were variable rate US dollar-denominated.&#13;
&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 5.0% at June 30, 2007&#13;
(4.9% at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Capital and retained earnings&#13;
As of June 30, 2007, IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in IFC's consolidated balance sheet) amounted to $14.1 billion, up&#13;
from the June 30, 2006 level of $11.1 billion. At June 30, 2007, net worth comprised $2.4 billion of paid-in capital, unchanged&#13;
from June 30, 2006, $11.3 billion of retained earnings ($8.7 billion at June 30, 2006), and $0.4 billion of accumulated other&#13;
comprehensive income ($0 at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2007 and 2006, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.36 billion was subscribed. Over 99% of this&#13;
was paid in ($2.37 billion at June 30, 2007, $2.36 billion at June 30, 2006). IFC has agreed to defer the payment dates for certain&#13;
member countries. Pursuant to these arrangements, $1 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2007, unchanged&#13;
from June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2007, retained earnings comprised $10.7 billion of undesignated retained earnings ($7.8 billion at June 30, 2006), $0.4&#13;
billion of retained earnings designated for advisory services ($0.5 billion at June 30, 2006), $0.2 billion of retained earnings&#13;
designated for PBG ($0.2 billion at June 30, 2006), and $0 of retained earnings designated for grants to IDA ($0.2 billion at June&#13;
30, 2006).&#13;

V. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
In executing its sustainable private sector development business, IFC assumes various kinds of risks. IFC's management has defined&#13;
a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, within which it recognizes four main risk groupings: strategic risk, credit&#13;
risk, financial risk, and operational risk.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Active management of these risks is a key determinant of IFC's success and its ability to maintain a stable capital and earnings base,&#13;
and is an essential part of its operations. As part of its enterprise risk management framework, IFC has adopted several key&#13;
financial and exposure policies and a number of prudential policies.&#13;
&#13;
FY07 enterprise risk highlights&#13;
IFC established a stand-alone Risk Management Vice Presidency in FY07. The risk management function in IFC is being&#13;
enhanced to rationalize and expand existing functions and in some cases, establish new capacity for additional functions.&#13;

&#13;
  ·    Enhancing risk/return metrics and other corporate tools for risk-rating and active portfolio management including&#13;
       economic capital allocation, improved risk rating systems and associated principles that allow for greater&#13;
       decentralization and accountability for pricing, performance measurement and portfolio management.&#13;
  ·    Establishing a new Market and Liquidity Risk unit which will among other things look into the development of a&#13;
       Corporate Value at Risk measurement system for IFC.&#13;
  ·    Implementing a Corporate-wide Value at Risk measurement and management system.&#13;
  ·    Expanding IFC's operational risk assessment and management capabilities beyond investment operations, anti-money&#13;
       laundering and anti-corruption efforts to encompass advisory services and reputation risk management.&#13;
  ·    Streamlining and strengthening operating processes and enhancing reporting effectiveness and accountability through&#13;
       an ongoing Business Process Review.&#13;
  ·    Integrating development impact metrics with financial risk-return metrics.&#13;
  ·    Strengthening internal controls especially around financial reporting, advisory service activities and information&#13;
       technology expenditures.&#13;
  ·    Working toward enhanced and harmonized reporting of all risk metrics and uses of delegated authorities from the&#13;
       Board.&#13;
  ·    Establishing a platform for a Corporate-wide compilation of risk and financial management policies for IFC activities and&#13;
       operations and their dissemination across the Corporation alongside decentralization efforts.&#13;
  ·    Preparing a framework for, and anticipating, potential financial risks in IFC member countries or general portfolio&#13;
       deterioration.&#13;
  ·    Piloting and using an economic capital approach for capital adequacy, capital allocation and internal risk management&#13;
       purposes as well as for setting general loan loss reserves. This approach brings IFC in line with industry best practice in&#13;
       the measurement of risk.&#13;
  ·    The Project Risk Management function merged into an Operational Risk unit within the Business Risk Department in order&#13;
       to take a more systematic approach to operational risk, with the mandate to expand its framework across other businesses&#13;
       of IFC.&#13;
  ·    As of July 1, 2007, the Insurance Services group was also integrated into the Business Risk Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC has been experiencing strong growth in all its businesses and is focused on implementing its strategic objective of becoming a&#13;
client-driven organization, providing global knowledge and local expertise with decentralized decision making. In parallel, IFC has&#13;
stepped up its efforts to maintain asset quality, enhanced the independence of its risk management function, and reaffirmed the&#13;
enterprise-wide nature of its mandate.&#13;
&#13;
IFC set up a pilot program in FY07 to increase risk management staffing and placed key credit risk managers and other risk&#13;
oversight disciplines in the Asia regional hub in order to improve the timeliness and quality of the risk decision process. The&#13;
comprehensiveness of the risk process at IFC necessitates reviews of economic and social risks, corporate governance standards for&#13;
clients, and reputation risk reviews in addition to the more traditional credit quality and operational concerns.&#13;
&#13;
This pilot program has become operational at the beginning of FY08. Based on lessons learned, IFC will continue to decentralize in&#13;
FY08, and risk management resources may be deployed to other regional hubs as needed. IFC believes that the move to put key&#13;
decision risk makers in the regions will significantly improve the quality of its enterprise risk management coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines strategic risk as the potential reputation, financial and other consequences of a failure to achieve its strategic mission&#13;
and, in particular, its sustainable development mandate.&#13;
&#13;
The overall management of strategic risk is effected through the definition and implementation of an annual strategy for meeting&#13;
IFC's mission and guidelines for its investment operations, advisory services, and treasury activities. The strategy is developed with&#13;
Senior Management by the Operational Strategy Group, and is approved by the Board of Directors. The Independent Evaluation&#13;
Group conducts ex post evaluations of the implementation of IFC's strategy on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's commitment to quality enterprise risk management, particularly on the environment and social front, continues to gain&#13;
acceptance with our strategic partners, as the "Equator Principles" announced in FY05 have now become an established standard&#13;
for financial institutions engaged in finance in the emerging markets. Responsibility for managing these economic and social risk&#13;
principles both internally and in liaison with other financial institutions rests with the Environment and Social Development&#13;
Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 114         IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In addition, IFC is focused on ensuring the evolving principles of corporate governance are accepted and practiced by our clients,&#13;
and we place great emphasis on developing these standards as part of our development activities. Responsibility for managing&#13;
corporate governance both internally and within our clients' operations rests with the Corporate Governance Department.&#13;
&#13;
More broadly, the responsibility for the management of the fundamental reputation risk associated with the selection of project&#13;
sponsors and the review of aspects relating to integrity rests with the operational departments, which are supported by the&#13;
Business Risk Department.&#13;
&#13;
The key guiding principles and policies established as part of the framework for controlling strategic risk are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Guiding principles for IFC's operations&#13;
   Catalytic role: IFC will seek above all to be a catalyst in facilitating productive investments in the private sector of its&#13;
   developing member countries. It does so by mobilizing financing from both foreign and domestic investors from the&#13;
   private and public sectors.&#13;
&#13;
   Business partnership: IFC functions like a business in partnership with the private sector. Thus, IFC takes the same&#13;
   commercial risks as do private institutions, investing its funds under the discipline of the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
   Additionality: IFC participates in an investment only when it can make a special contribution not offered or brought to&#13;
   the deal by other investors.&#13;
&#13;
   Environmental and social policies&#13;
   The Corporation has developed a comprehensive set of Guidelines and Safeguard Policies to promote environmentally and&#13;
   socially responsible private sector investments. Project sponsors are given the Safeguard Policies for environmental and&#13;
   social issues to review prior to conducting their assessments, as well as the environmental, health, and safety guidelines&#13;
   specific to the particular industry, sector, and type of project.&#13;
&#13;
   When making investments, IFC applies its standards to the project and project performance is monitored against those&#13;
   standards. Projects are expected to comply with the applicable policies and guidelines, as well as applicable local, national,&#13;
   and international laws.&#13;
&#13;
   IFC sanctions procedures&#13;
   In FY07, IFC established a set of procedures to sanction parties involved in IFC projects committing corrupt, fraudulent,&#13;
   collusive, coercive or obstructive practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY07 strategic risk highlights&#13;
IFC's Environmental and Social Policies have become widely recognized as best practice when twelve international commercial&#13;
banks adopted them in the form of the Equator Principles. To date, more than 50 leading international financial institutions have&#13;
adopted these principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As of January 1, 2007, IFC adopted a stricter enforcement of its approach to combating fraud and corruption related to newly&#13;
initiated investment financing, as well as advisory services. In conjunction with its sister organizations in the World Bank Group,&#13;
and as part of this new approach, IFC adopted new and expanded definitions of fraud and corruption, which were harmonized&#13;
with other multilateral development institutions. A process for sanctions and debarment of customers committing these bad acts&#13;
has been put in place. The enhanced emphasis on combating fraud and corruption does not change the high expectations IFC has&#13;
always held for its staff, clients and projects, including our due diligence and commitment to good corporate governance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007          115115&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Credit risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines credit risk as the potential reduction in value of on- and off-balance sheet assets due to a deteriorating credit profile of&#13;
its clients, the countries in which it invests, or a financial counterparty. Credit risk is incurred in two areas of IFC's operations: (i) in&#13;
its investment operations, where IFC provides loans, invests in debt securities and equity investments, provides guarantees and acts&#13;
as a derivatives counterparty for clients in its developing member countries, and (ii) in its treasury and portfolio management&#13;
operations, where credit risk is incurred with counterparties in IFC's liquid asset, borrowing, asset-liability management, and&#13;
portfolio management activities. As part of its mandate, IFC is prohibited from accepting host government guarantees of&#13;
repayment on its investments and, therefore, incurs commercial and sovereign risk on its investments.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's Risk Management and Financial Policy Department has oversight responsibility for overall financial risk management and, in&#13;
addition, monitors and controls credit risk arising in IFC's treasury activities. With respect to IFC's credit risk exposures to clients in&#13;
developing countries, the Credit Review Department plays a key role. At origination of new investments, the Credit Review&#13;
Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk&#13;
of the transaction. After commitment, the quality of IFC's investment portfolio is monitored according to supervision principles and&#13;
procedures defined in the Operational Policies and Procedures. Responsibility for the day-to-day monitoring and management of&#13;
credit risk in the portfolio rests with the portfolio management units of individual investment departments. Their assessments are&#13;
subject to quarterly review, on a sample basis, by the Loss Provisioning Division of the Controller's and Budgeting Department and&#13;
by the Credit Review Department.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investment portfolio is subject to a number of operational and prudential limits, including limitations on single project/client&#13;
exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Similarly, credit policies and guidelines have been formulated&#13;
covering treasury operations; these are subject to annual revision by the Risk Management and Financial Policy Department, and&#13;
approval by the Finance and Risk Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, IFC has adopted the following key financial policies and guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
   Investment operations&#13;
   1.   IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
   2.   An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total share capital,&#13;
        provided further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder. Until IFC resumes presentation of its financial statements in&#13;
        accordance with IFRS, IFC's equity investment in a company will not normally represent more than 20% of the company's&#13;
        total share capital.&#13;
   3.   Total investment in a single obligor, net of specific reserves, may not exceed 4% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves&#13;
        on loans.&#13;
   4.   Equity plus quasi-equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 3% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves on&#13;
        loans.&#13;
   5.   Straight equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 1.5% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves on loans.&#13;
   Portfolio management&#13;
   1.   Review trigger levels ranging from 2.5% to 10% of net worth plus general reserves are set for each country's outstanding&#13;
        portfolio, net of specific reserves, based on the size of its economy and its risk rating.&#13;
   2.   IFC lender of record exposure in a country (outstanding) may not exceed 10% of a country's total long-term external debt&#13;
        for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and 5% for all other countries. Exceptions for countries with low levels of external&#13;
        debt may be made by the Finance and Risk Committee. Lower trigger levels are set for certain countries.&#13;
   3.   IFC's total exposure (outstanding net of specific reserves on loans) to a single risk sector may not exceed 12% of net worth&#13;
        plus general reserves. Lower review trigger levels are set for single sectors, and individually for the finance and insurance&#13;
        sector, based on IFC's net worth plus general reserves and the country exposure level.&#13;
   4.   IFC's committed exposure in guarantees that are subrogated in local currency is limited to $300 million for currencies for&#13;
        which there are no adequate currency and interest rate risk hedging instruments as determined by IFC's Treasury&#13;
        Department at the time of commitment. There is a sublimit of $100 million for an individual currency under this limit.&#13;
   Treasury operations&#13;
   1.   Counterparties are subject to conservative eligibility criteria, currently restricted to banks and financial institutions with a&#13;
        minimum credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies.&#13;
   2.   Exposures to individual counterparties are subject to concentration caps. For derivatives, exposure is measured in terms of&#13;
        "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables. Institution-specific limits are updated monthly&#13;
        based on changes in counterparty size or credit status.&#13;
   3.   To limit exposure, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net&#13;
        exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates.&#13;
   4.   Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to&#13;
        terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if other early termination events occur&#13;
        that are standard in the market.&#13;
   5.   For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges,&#13;
        contracts and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's position in each contract.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FY07 credit risk highlights&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than&#13;
60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding the unamortized SFAS No. 133&#13;
transition adjustment and unamortized deferred loan origination fees, net, a key indicator of portfolio performance, decreased to&#13;
3.0% at June 30, 2007 (4.2% at June 30, 2006). The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $378 million at&#13;
June 30, 2007, a decrease of $69 million (15%) from the June 30, 2006, level of $447 million.&#13;
&#13;
The quality of IFC's investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate risk level, improved further during FY07, continuing the&#13;
trends noted during FY06 and FY05. Total reserves against losses on loans at June 30, 2007, decreased to $832 million ($898&#13;
million at June 30, 2006). This is equivalent to 6.5% of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding the unamortized SFAS No. 133&#13;
transition adjustment and unamortized deferred loan origination fees, net, significantly below the level of 8.3% at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
The five-year trend of reserves against losses on loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding the unamortized&#13;
SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment and unamortized deferred loan origination fees, net, is presented below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC operates under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is exposed to the same idiosyncratic and systematic risks as IFC's&#13;
loan portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for loss. The&#13;
allowance at June 30, 2007, was $16 million ($18 million at June 30, 2006), based on the year-end portfolio, and is included in&#13;
payables and other liabilities on IFC's consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in allowance for the year, $2 million for FY07 ($5&#13;
million increase for FY06), is included in the release of provision for losses on loans and guarantees in the consolidated income&#13;
statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has not suffered credit losses on its exposures to derivatives counterparties in its treasury operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007          117117&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines financial risk in three components: (a) the potential inability to realize asset values in its portfolio sufficient to meet&#13;
obligations to disburse funds as they arise (liquidity risk); (b) the potential inability to access funding at reasonable cost (funding&#13;
risk); and (c) a deterioration in values of financial instruments or positions due to changes in market interest and exchange rates and&#13;
the volatility thereof (market risk).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key financial policies and guidelines&#13;
During FY07, IFC updated and, where appropriate, revised its liquidity and capital adequacy policies. IFC currently operates under a&#13;
number of key financial policies and guidelines as detailed below, which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   1.   Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of impairment write-downs) may not exceed 100% of net worth.&#13;
&#13;
   2.   Minimum liquidity (liquid assets plus undrawn borrowing commitments from IBRD) must be sufficient at all times to&#13;
        cover at least 45% of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
   3.   Loans are funded with liabilities having the same characteristics in terms of interest rate basis and currency and, for&#13;
        fixed rate loans, duration except for Board-approved new products involving asset-liability mismatches. IFC maintains&#13;
        a minimum level of liquidity, consisting of proceeds from external funding, that covers at least 65% of the sum of: (i)&#13;
        100% of committed but undisbursed straight senior loans; (ii) 30% of committed guarantees; and (iii) 30% of&#13;
        committed client risk management products.&#13;
&#13;
   4.   For FY07, IFC's capital adequacy policy requires a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets of 30%. Under the&#13;
        revised policy, IFC is required to maintain a minimum level of total resources (including paid-in capital, total loss&#13;
        reserves and retained earnings net of designations) equal to total potential losses for all on- and off-balance sheet&#13;
        exposures estimated at levels consistent with the maintenance of a AAA rating.&#13;
&#13;
   In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from IBRD, IFC's leverage, as&#13;
   measured by the ratio of IFC's outstanding debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's net worth (using&#13;
   subscribed capital), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk&#13;
&#13;
Within the key financial policies and guidelines described above, in practice IFC maintains, as a prudential measure, an operating&#13;
liquidity guideline ranging from 65% to 95% of the next three years' net cash requirements, including projected disbursement and&#13;
debt service requirements.&#13;
&#13;
The primary instruments for maintaining sufficient liquidity are IFC's liquid asset portfolios. As noted above, IFC distinguishes five&#13;
such portfolios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !     P0, which is generally invested in short-dated deposits, money market funds, and tri-party repos, reflecting its use for&#13;
        short-term funding requirements.&#13;
  !     P1, which is generally invested in: (a) foreign sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed and supranational fixed income&#13;
        instruments (rated AA- or better); (b) US Treasury or agency instruments; (c) asset-backed securities rated AAA by at&#13;
        least two rating agencies and/or other AAA rated notes issued by Corporations; (d) interest rate futures and swaps to&#13;
        manage currency risk in the portfolio, as well as its duration relative to benchmark; and (e) cash deposits.&#13;
  !     P2, which is generally invested in US Treasuries, other sovereign and agency issues and mortgage-backed securities.&#13;
  !     P3, which comprises a global fixed income portfolio and a mortgage-backed securities portfolio (managed by external&#13;
        managers).&#13;
  !     P4, which is an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio (managed by external managers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY07 liquidity risk highlights&#13;
At June 30, 2007, IFC's liquidity level stood at $13.3 billion, or 85% of its projected net cash requirements for three years ($12.7&#13;
billion, and 112% at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 118         IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Funding risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC's primary objective with respect to managing funding risk is, through the adoption of the key financial policies described above,&#13;
to maintain its triple-A or AAA/Aaa credit ratings and, thereby, maintain access to market funding as needed at the lowest possible&#13;
cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY07 funding risk highlights&#13;
During FY07, IFC raised $2.8 billion ($1.8 billion in FY06) of funding at sub-LIBOR rates.&#13;
&#13;
Market risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC's exposure to market risk is minimized by adopting the matched-funding policy noted above and by using derivative instruments&#13;
to convert assets and liabilities into floating rate US dollar assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Investment operations&#13;
Interest rate and currency exchange risk associated with fixed rate and/or non-US dollar lending is hedged via currency and interest&#13;
rate swaps that convert cash flows into variable rate US dollar flows.&#13;
&#13;
Exposures to market risk resulting from derivative transactions with clients, which are intended to facilitate clients' risk&#13;
management, are minimized by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolios&#13;
The P0, P1 and P3 portfolios are managed to variable rate US dollar benchmarks, on a portfolio basis. To this end, a variety of&#13;
derivative instruments are used, including short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate&#13;
and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. IFC also takes both long and short positions in&#13;
securities in the management of these portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The primary source of market risk in the liquid asset portfolios is the P2 and P4 portfolios, which, in contrast, are managed to a&#13;
three-year duration US dollar benchmark, with additional flexibility to deviate from the benchmark. P2 represents the portion of&#13;
IFC's capital not disbursed as equity investments, and the benchmark reflects the chosen risk profile for this uninvested capital. P4&#13;
represents an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio. In addition, the P1 and P3 portfolios contain a degree of market risk (e.g.,&#13;
spread risk).&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
Access to funding is maximized, and cost is minimized, by issuing debt securities in various capital markets in a variety of currencies,&#13;
sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with&#13;
principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a reference interest rate, or one or more foreign&#13;
exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments entered into as part of IFC's funding program is&#13;
generally mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the&#13;
matched-funding policy.&#13;
&#13;
Asset-liability management&#13;
While IFC's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, IFC can be&#13;
exposed to residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. This residual market risk is monitored by the Asset-&#13;
Liability Management group within the Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
Residual currency risk arises from events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves. This risk is managed by&#13;
monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or liability position&#13;
exceeds $5 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
Residual interest rate risk may arise from two main sources:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !     Assets that are fully match-funded at inception, which can become mismatched over time due to write-downs,&#13;
        prepayments, or rescheduling; and&#13;
  !     Differing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007             119119&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This residual risk is managed by: first, synchronizing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities at a portfolio level; and second,&#13;
measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates,&#13;
with an action trigger of $50,000 for a one basis point parallel move in the yield curve.&#13;
&#13;
FY07 market risk highlights&#13;
Total liquid asset returns (comprising interest, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains&#13;
(losses)) were $618 million in FY07 ($444 million in FY06 and $358 million in FY05), of which $187 million was attributable to the&#13;
P0, P1 and P3 portfolios ($378 million in FY06 and $212 million in FY05), and $306 million was attributable to the P2 and P4&#13;
portfolios ($66 million in FY06 and $146 million in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
Foreign currency transaction gains on non-trading activities for FY07 were $17 million ($6 million in FY06 and $7 million loss in&#13;
FY05).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operational risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, systems and processes. These include&#13;
both internal and external events, whether caused by a lack of controls, documentation, or contingency planning, or by&#13;
breakdowns in information systems, communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing,&#13;
or in the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. As such, operational risk covers the risks emanating from the&#13;
manner in which an entity is operated as opposed to the way it is financed.&#13;
&#13;
Consistent with the Basel II Capital Adequacy guidelines, IFC is developing a matrix framework to analyze operational risk by&#13;
identifying, for each area (people, systems and processes), which risks IFC will: (i) manage internally, as part of its ongoing business;&#13;
(ii) alleviate through contingency planning; or (iii) transfer to third parties, whether by subcontracting, outsourcing, hedging, or&#13;
insurance.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibility for the development of the framework for managing and monitoring operational risk now rests with the Operational&#13;
Risk Division of the Business Risk Department. Responsibility for contingency planning for recovery from emergencies rests with the&#13;
Controller's Department. In respect of insurable operational risk, IFC's Insurance Services Division, which is now part of the Business&#13;
Risk Department, performs insurance reviews to identify underlying risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and&#13;
limits.&#13;
&#13;
IFC seeks to mitigate the risks it manages internally by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is designed not&#13;
only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. Key components&#13;
of this effort are listed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Key components of operational risk management&#13;
    !    In FY07, IFC established an Operational Risk Division which will develop assessments and measure areas of operational&#13;
         risk in IFC, using well-defined market practices and tools.&#13;
    !    IFC has adopted the COSO1control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the effectiveness&#13;
         of its internal controls in all significant business operations. In addition, the COBIT2 methodology is used to supplement&#13;
         the COSO review of the information technology function. The program includes compliance testing of key internal&#13;
         controls assuring the reliability of external financial reporting and has been applied to Donor Funded Operations as well.&#13;
    !    The Internal Audit Department of the World Bank Group performs ongoing independent review of the effectiveness of&#13;
         IFC's internal controls in selected key areas and functions.&#13;
    !    To promote data integrity, the Corporation has formulated a Data Management Policy. The policy is enforced by the&#13;
         Information Quality Group within the Controller's Department and through a network of Departmental Data Stewards.&#13;
    !    IFC has a New Products/Initiatives Assessment Group, with representation from key business and support functions, to&#13;
         ensure that processes and controls are in place to manage the risks in new products and initiatives before they are&#13;
         executed.&#13;
&#13;
    1. COSO refers to the Internal Control - Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which&#13;
    was convened by the US Congress in response to the well-publicized irregularities that occurred in the financial sector in the United States during the late 1980s.&#13;
    2. COBIT refers to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, first released in 1996, updated to the 3rd edition released in July 2000, sponsored&#13;
    by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
FY07 operational risk highlights&#13;
IFC continues to focus on its preparedness to react to an emergency situation that could disrupt its normal operations. During&#13;
FY07, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !    Added applications and capabilities to back-up facilities available for its key strategic financial and support systems and&#13;
       continued extensive testing thereof.&#13;
  !    Reinforced and extended home computing arrangements for essential staff in all departments, as part of the IFC's avian&#13;
       flu contingency planning.&#13;
  !    Conducted awareness training for Washington, DC-based departments and larger country offices, covering business&#13;
       continuity in general and pandemic preparedness in particular.&#13;
  !    Established Emergency Management Teams in all regions; conducted emergency simulation exercises in its Washington,&#13;
       DC offices and in the regional hub offices; and held emergency management workshops in the larger country offices in&#13;
       each region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC is continuing a multiyear effort to analyze and develop enhanced methodologies for measuring, monitoring and managing&#13;
operational risk in its key activities. During FY07, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  !    As part of a Business Process Review, identified specific ways to speed up project processing in investment operations,&#13;
       improve risk management, and allow IFC to respond more efficiently and effectively to the needs of clients.&#13;
  !    Developed a framework for IFC's strategic and operational risk functions within the enlarged Business Risk Department.&#13;
  !    Continued a process-mapping exercise to identify potential areas of exposure to operational risk in its investment and&#13;
       advisory services processes and to provide a basis for quantifying potential risks;.&#13;
  !    Within the former Project Risk Management function (now the new Operational Risk Division) completed the&#13;
       cataloguing of operational aspects to be tracked in portfolio projects, and rolled it out to all pipeline projects in&#13;
       investment operations.&#13;
  !    Made plans to expand these activities across IFC's other businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In FY07, IFC continued its voluntary practice of conducting an annual assessment of its internal controls over external financial&#13;
reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over external financial reporting described in COSO. Based upon this&#13;
assessment, management believes that IFC maintained effective internal control over external financial reporting presented in&#13;
conformity with US GAAP, as of June 30, 2007. As a result of changes in applicable auditing standards, beginning with FY06,&#13;
management has not sought the attestation to its published assertion on internal controls previously provided by IFC's external&#13;
auditors. IFC is adopting its own risk-based internal control initiative, and will continue to monitor year to year whether alignment&#13;
between this and emerging external standards enable it to seek the external auditors' attestation once again.&#13;
&#13;
Management has carried out an evaluation of internal controls over external financial reporting for the purposes of determining if&#13;
there were any changes made in internal controls during the year ended June 30, 2007, that had materially affected, or would be&#13;
reasonably likely to materially affect, IFC's internal control over external financial reporting. As of June 30, 2007, no such significant&#13;
changes occurred.&#13;
&#13;
Internal controls and procedures are those processes which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is&#13;
accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure by IFC.&#13;
Management believes that these controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2007.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The Notes to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements contain a summary of IFC's significant accounting policies, including a&#13;
discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Certain of these policies are considered to be "critical" to the portrayal&#13;
of IFC's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may&#13;
relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include: (i) determining the level of the allowance for losses in the&#13;
loan portfolio; (ii) determining the level of impairment of equity investments; and (iii) determining the valuation of certain financial&#13;
instruments with no quoted market prices. Additional information about these policies can be found in Notes A, C, O and P to the&#13;
FY07 consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans&#13;
&#13;
IFC considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that IFC will be unable to collect all&#13;
amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans reflects management's&#13;
judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The reserve against&#13;
losses for loans includes an estimate of probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The&#13;
reserve is established through periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans. Loans written off, as well&#13;
as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of the adequacy of reserves against losses for loans is highly dependent on management's judgment about factors&#13;
such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions, and historical trends. Due to the inherent&#13;
limitation of any particular estimation technique, management utilizes a capital pricing and risk framework to estimate the probable&#13;
losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. This Board approved framework uses actual loan loss&#13;
history and aligns the loan loss provisioning framework with IFC's capital adequacy framework.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans is separately reported in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of IFC's total loans.&#13;
Increases or decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as provision for losses or release of provision for&#13;
losses on loans, and guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans relates only to the Client Services segment of IFC (see Note R&#13;
to the FY07 consolidated financial statements for further discussion of IFC's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
Equity impairment&#13;
&#13;
IFC assesses all equity investments for impairment each quarter. When impairment is identified and is deemed to be other than&#13;
temporary, the equity investment is written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis in the equity investment.&#13;
IFC has elected to assume that all impairments shall be deemed to be other than temporary. Impairment losses are not reversed for&#13;
subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to March 31, 2005, IFC had carried reserves against losses on the equity investment portfolio. During the year ended June 30,&#13;
2005, IFC changed its process of estimating impairment on equity investments to adopt an impairment methodology based largely&#13;
on fair value estimates. As a result, IFC recorded a change in carrying value of the equity investment portfolio. In this regard, IFC&#13;
determined that all impairments and changes in carrying value were deemed to be other than temporary. This change in carrying&#13;
value of the equity portfolio was reflected in net income from equity investments in the FY05 consolidated income statement and in&#13;
equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of financial instruments with no quoted market prices&#13;
&#13;
As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, IFC reports at fair value all of its derivative instruments and certain borrowings that IFC&#13;
has designated as components of fair value hedges. In addition, certain features in various loan agreements, equity investment&#13;
agreements, and borrowing contracts contain embedded derivatives that, for accounting purposes, are separately accounted as&#13;
either derivative assets or liabilities, including puts, caps, floors, and forwards. Few of these instruments have a ready market&#13;
valuation. Therefore, the fair values of the financial instruments with no quoted market prices are estimated using complex pricing&#13;
models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes numerous assumptions in developing the&#13;
pricing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates, and related volatility and expected movement in foreign&#13;
currency exchange rates. Changes in assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts reported as assets and liabilities&#13;
and the related gains and losses reported in the income statement. The fair value computations affect both the Client Services and&#13;
Treasury segments of IFC (see Note R to the FY07 consolidated financial statements for further discussion of IFC's business&#13;
segments).&#13;
&#13;
Additional information can be found in Notes A, O and P to the FY07 consolidated financial statements.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits&#13;
&#13;
IFC participates, along with IBRD and MIGA, in pension and postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of their staff&#13;
members. All costs, assets and liabilities associated with the plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA based upon their&#13;
employees' respective participation in the plans. The underlying actuarial assumptions used to determine the projected benefit&#13;
obligations, fair value of plan assets and funded status associated with these plans are based on financial market interest rates, past&#13;
experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions. For further details, please refer&#13;

 Net income:&#13;
&#13;
 Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments     Principally, differences between changes in fair values of derivative instruments and&#13;
                                                               changes in fair value of hedged items in fair value hedging relationships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY07 and FY06, and FY06 and FY05, covering the periods included in&#13;
IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note A to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements, certain&#13;
amounts in FY06 and FY05 have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. Where applicable, the following&#13;
paragraphs reflect reclassified prior year comparative information. Such reclassifications had no effect on operating income, net&#13;
income or total assets.&#13;
&#13;
FY07 versus FY06&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
IFC's income before expenditures for advisory services, PBG, grants to IDA and net gains (losses) on non-trading financial&#13;
instruments for FY07 was $2,857 million. Expenditures for advisory services for FY07 totaled $96 million and grants to IDA totaled&#13;
$150 million, resulting in operating income for FY07 of $2,611 million.&#13;
&#13;
The record operating performance in FY07 was mainly attributable to significant equity income (principally capital gains and&#13;
dividends). In addition, there was a continued overall improvement in the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as&#13;
measured by portfolio impairment and portfolio risk levels, although at a slower pace than in FY06. The aggregate risk level within&#13;
the portfolio has been reduced principally due to: (i) the successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii) the growth&#13;
in the outstanding portfolio in new investments with better risk ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse risk ratings than&#13;
the average risk rating of the portfolio; and (iv) an overall improvement in country risk ratings. This improvement began during the&#13;
latter stages of FY03 and has continued through FY07. Additionally, IFC's liquid asset portfolios yielded significant positive&#13;
contributions to IFC's operating income, totaling $618 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans and debt securities&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning asset is its loan portfolio. Interest and financial fees from loans and debt securities (including&#13;
guarantee fees) for FY07 totaled $1,075 million, compared with $807 million in FY06, an increase of $268 million, or 33%.&#13;
&#13;
The growth in the loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY07, when compared with FY06,&#13;
contributed $211 million of the increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual status,&#13;
net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $12 million lower in FY07, compared to FY06. Income&#13;
from IFC's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, was $24 million higher in FY07 than in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Commitment and financial fees, after the effects of deferring and amortizing net loan origination fees, were $45 million higher&#13;
than in FY06, principally reflecting growth attributable to strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 124           IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
IFC's charges on borrowings increased by $198 million, from $603 million in FY06 to $801 million in FY07, largely reflecting the&#13;
increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY07 and FY06. Charges on borrowings in FY07 includes $8&#13;
million in respect of interest expense on secured borrowings ($6 million in FY06). The weighted average cost of IFC's borrowings&#13;
outstanding from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose during the year from 4.9% at June 30,&#13;
2006 to 5.0% at June 30, 2007. The size of the borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of&#13;
SFAS No. 133, increased by $0.3 billion in FY07 from $15.3 billion at June 30, 2006, to $15.6 billion at June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading&#13;
activities, and a small currency translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities,&#13;
increased from $12.7 billion at June 30, 2006, to $13.3 billion at June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset income totaled $618 million in FY07 ($444 million in FY06). In a year when US interest rates were relatively stable,&#13;
although higher on average than in FY06, IFC has been able to increase the level of absolute income from its liquid asset portfolios. In&#13;
FY07, the P0 and P3 portfolios outperformed their respective benchmarks, while the P1, P2, and P4 portfolios underperformed their&#13;
respective benchmarks. In FY06, all of IFC's liquid asset portfolios outperformed their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The P1 portfolio generated income of $211 million in FY07, a return of 4.61%. In FY06, the P1 portfolio generated a return of $288&#13;
million, or 5.20%. The P3 portfolio, managed against the same variable rate target as the P1 portfolio returned $59 million in FY07, or&#13;
5.82%, $16 million higher than the $43 million, or 4.31%, return in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
The P2 and P4 portfolios returned $247 million (4.54%) and $20 million (5.17%) in FY07, respectively, as compared to $64 million&#13;
(1.38%) and $2 million (0.35%) in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's P0 portfolio earned $81 million in FY07, a total return of 5.52%, as compared to $47 million (4.48%) in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio increased by $1,078 million from $1,228 million in FY06 to a record $2,306 million in&#13;
FY07.&#13;
&#13;
IFC generated realized capital gains on equity sales, including recoveries of previously written-off equity investments and net of&#13;
losses on sales of equity investments, for FY07 of $1,942 million, as compared with $928 million for FY06, an increase of $1,014&#13;
million. During FY07, IFC sold its shares in Banca Comerciala Romana S.A. and recorded a capital gain in the amount of $833&#13;
million. Total realized capital gains on equity sales from 13 investments generated individual capital gains in excess of $20 million&#13;
and comprised 76% of the FY07 gains (before write-offs and losses on sales), compared to 11 investments that generated&#13;
individual capital gains in excess of $20 million and comprised 42% of the FY06 gains. IFC continued to take advantage of buoyant&#13;
markets throughout most of FY07 to sell equities and take some limited gains in investments where IFC's developmental role was&#13;
complete, and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY07 at $398 million, as compared with $327 million in FY06. Consistent with&#13;
FY06, a significant amount of IFC's dividend income in FY07 was due to returns on IFC's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining&#13;
sectors accounted for under the cost recovery method, which totaled $64 million in FY07, as compared with $86 million in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Income from LLPs, certain LLCs, and other investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $19 million in FY07 ($56&#13;
million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
Release of provision for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
As noted above, the quality of IFC's loan portfolio continued to improve during FY07 although at a slower pace than in FY06 and&#13;
FY05. IFC recorded a release of provision for losses on loans and guarantees of $43 million in FY07 ($15 million provision in FY06),&#13;
including $2 million in respect of guarantees ($5 million provision in FY06). On June 30, 2007, IFC's total reserves against losses on&#13;
loans were 6.5% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio excluding unamortized deferred net loan origination fees and the&#13;
unamortized SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment (8.3% at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Other income&#13;
Other income of $116 million for FY07 was $1 million higher than in FY06 ($115 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007              125125&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Other expenses&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 11% from $436 million in FY06 to $482 million&#13;
in FY07, principally reflecting the significant increase in business volumes and staff complement in country offices in FY07 when&#13;
compared to FY06. Administrative expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to IFC's&#13;
reimbursable program and jeopardy projects ($34 million in FY07, as compared with $37 million in FY06). IFC recorded expense&#13;
from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY07 of $15 million, as compared with $28 million in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services in FY07 totaled $96 million, $41 million, or 75% higher than expenditures for advisory services of&#13;
$55 million in FY06. The increase reflects the continued growth in demand for such services.&#13;
&#13;
Grants to IDA&#13;
During FY07, IFC transferred $150 million to IDA, recording an expense of $150 million.&#13;
&#13;
Net income&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, O and P to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements, IFC has designated certain hedging&#13;
relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges. IFC generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the&#13;
specific underlying borrowing hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features.&#13;
However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument. The resulting&#13;
ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY07 and FY06 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      FY07                FY06&#13;

 Net income                                                                                     $    2,618         $     1,278&#13;
&#13;
Net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships and the fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has not been elected in relation to borrowings and lending activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY06 versus FY05&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
IFC's income before expenditures for advisory services and PBG and net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments for FY06&#13;
was $1,499 million. Expenditures for advisory services for FY06 were $55 million, and expenditures for PBG for FY06 were $35&#13;
million, resulting in operating income for FY06 of $1,409 million. The continued strong operating performance in FY06, following&#13;
on FY05's record year, was mainly attributable to continued significant equity income (principally capital gains and dividends) and a&#13;
continued overall improvement in the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as measured by portfolio impairment and&#13;
portfolio risk levels, although at a slower pace than in FY05. The aggregate risk level within the portfolio has been reduced&#13;
principally due to: (i) the successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii) the growth in the outstanding portfolio in&#13;
new investments with better risk ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse risk ratings than the average risk rating of the&#13;
portfolio; and (iv) an overall improvement in country risk ratings. This improvement began during the latter stages of FY03 and&#13;
continued up to and including FY06. IFC's liquid asset portfolios yielded strong positive contributions to IFC's operating income.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans and debt securities&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning assets is its loan portfolio. Interest and financial fees from loans and debt securities (including&#13;
guarantee fees) for FY06 totaled $807 million, compared with $660 million in FY05, an increase of $147 million, or 22%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 126         IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Interest income increased from $574 million in FY05 to $743 million in FY06, an increase of $169 million, or 29%. The growth in&#13;
the loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY06, when compared with FY05, contributed $231&#13;
million, including net interest income on lending-related swaps, of the increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans&#13;
being removed from non-accrual status, net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $20 million&#13;
lower in FY06, compared to FY05. Income from IFC's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, was $25&#13;
million lower in FY06 than in FY05. Interest income from loans serving as collateral under secured borrowing arrangements&#13;
totaled $6 million in FY06 ($0 in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
Commitment and financial fees fell to $64 million in FY06 from $86 million in FY05, principally reflecting the change in accounting&#13;
principle concerning the deferral of net loan origination fees which offset the growth attributable to strong commitments and&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
IFC's charges on borrowings increased by $294 million, from $309 million in FY05 to $603 million in FY06, largely reflecting the&#13;
increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY06 and FY05. Charges on borrowings in FY06 includes $6&#13;
million in respect of interest expense on secured borrowings ($0 in FY05). The weighted average cost of IFC's borrowings&#13;
outstanding from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose during the year from 3.3% at June 30,&#13;
2005 to 4.9% at June 30, 2006. The size of the borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of&#13;
SFAS No. 133 decreased by $0.7 billion in FY06 from $16.0 billion at June 30, 2005, to $15.3 billion at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading&#13;
activities, and a small currency effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, decreased from&#13;
$13.3 billion at June 30, 2005, to $12.7 billion at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset income totaled $444 million in FY06 ($358 million in FY05). In a year when interest rates rose, IFC has still been able to&#13;
increase income. In FY06, all of IFC's liquid asset portfolios outperformed their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of liquid asset income in FY06 was attributable to IFC's P1 portfolio, which is actively managed against a variable rate&#13;
benchmark. This portfolio generated income of $288 million in FY06, a return of 5.20% ($162 million in FY05, a return of 2.24%).&#13;
The P3 portfolio, managed against the same variable rate target, returned $43 million in FY06, $17 million higher than in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
The P2 and P4 portfolios delivered 156 and 54 basis points of excess return versus their Lehman Brothers Intermediate US Treasury&#13;
Index. With rates on the rise, the benchmark actually lost 0.19% in FY06. The P2 and P4 portfolios returned $64 million (1.38%) and&#13;
$2 million (0.35%) in FY06, respectively, as compared to $130 million (3.73%) and $16 million (4.51%) in FY05. The positive&#13;
performance of the P2 portfolio was achieved due to directional and yield curve strategies designed specifically to take advantage of&#13;
the tightening of monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's holdings of US, European and Japanese inflation-indexed securities whose income varies with inflation in the P1and P2 portfolios&#13;
was a significant contributor to the outperformance relative to benchmark.&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio decreased by $137 million from $1,365 million in FY05 to $1,228 million in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
IFC generated realized capital gains on equity sales, including recoveries of previously written-off equity investments and net of&#13;
losses on sales of equity investments, for FY06 of $928 million, as compared with $723 million for FY05, an increase of $205&#13;
million. Realized capital gains on equity sales from 14 investments comprised 50% of the FY06 gains (before write-offs and losses&#13;
on sales), compared to 19 investments comprising 71% of the FY05 gains. IFC continued to take advantage of buoyant markets&#13;
throughout most of FY06 to sell equities and take some limited gains in investments where IFC's developmental role was complete,&#13;
and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY06 at $327 million, as compared with $258 million in FY05. Consistent with&#13;
FY05, a significant amount of IFC's dividend income in FY06 was due to returns on IFC's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining&#13;
sectors accounted for under the cost recovery method, which totaled $86 million in FY06, as compared with $106 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
Income from LLPs, certain LLCs, and other investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $56 million in FY06 ($191&#13;
million in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007               127127&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
As noted above, the quality of IFC's loan portfolio continued to improve during FY06, although at a slower pace than in FY05. IFC&#13;
recorded a small provision for losses on loans and guarantees of $15 million in FY06 ($261 million release of provision in FY05),&#13;
including $5 million in respect of guarantees ($3 million release of provision in FY05). On June 30, 2006, IFC's total reserves against&#13;
losses on loans were 8.3% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio excluding unamortized deferred net loan origination&#13;
fees and the unamortized SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment (9.9% at June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Other income&#13;
Other income of $115 million for FY06 was $36 million higher than in FY05 ($79 million).&#13;
&#13;
Other expenses&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 8% from $403 million in FY05 to $436 million in&#13;
FY06, principally reflecting IFC's higher budget authority in FY06 when compared to FY05. Administrative expenses include the&#13;
grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to IFC's reimbursable program and jeopardy projects ($37 million&#13;
in FY06, as compared with $33 million in FY05). IFC recorded expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY06&#13;
of $28 million, as compared with $14 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
Net income&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, O and P to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements, IFC has designated certain hedging&#13;
relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges. IFC generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the&#13;
specific underlying borrowing hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features.&#13;
However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument. The resulting&#13;
ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY06 and FY05 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    FY06                 FY05&#13;
 Operating income                                                                             $    1,409           $    1,953&#13;
 SFAS No. 133 adjustments:&#13;
 Net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments                                             (131)                 62&#13;
 Net income                                                                                   $    1,278           $    2,015&#13;
&#13;
Net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships and the fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has not been elected in relation to borrowings and lending activities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
VIII. GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
Management changes&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Directors (Board) is charged, under the Articles of Agreement, with the selection of IFC's President. Mr. Paul&#13;
Wolfowitz resigned on June 30, 2007. The Board of Directors unanimously selected Mr. Robert B. Zoellick to be the next President;&#13;
his appointment became effective July 1, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Michel G. Maila was appointed Vice President, Risk Management effective January 16, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with its Articles of Agreement, members of IFC's Board are appointed or elected by their member governments.&#13;
These Directors are neither officers nor staff of IFC. The President is the only management member of the Board, serving as a non-&#13;
voting member and as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established several Committees including:&#13;
&#13;
!    Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
!    Audit Committee&#13;
!    Budget Committee&#13;
!    Personnel Committee&#13;
!    Ethics Committee&#13;
!    Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Board and its Committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank Group, as business requires.&#13;
Each Committee's terms of reference establish its respective roles and responsibilities. As Committees do not vote on issues, their&#13;
role is primarily to serve the full Board in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board, based&#13;
upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. In addition, membership of&#13;
the Committee is expected to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of IFC's member countries. Other relevant selection&#13;
criteria include seniority, continuity and relevant experience. Some or all of the responsibilities of individual Committee members are&#13;
performed by their alternates or advisors. Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two-year term; reappointment to a&#13;
second term, when possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally open to any members of the Board&#13;
who may wish to attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may participate in the discussion. In addition, the Chairman&#13;
of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board with respect to discussions held in the Audit&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key responsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist it in the oversight and assessment of IFC's finances and accounting,&#13;
including the effectiveness of financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of internal controls regarding&#13;
finance, accounting and ethics (including fraud and corruption), and financial and operational risks. The Audit Committee also has&#13;
the responsibility for reviewing the performance and recommending to the Board the appointment of the external auditor, as well&#13;
as monitoring the independence of the external auditor and meeting with it in executive session. The Audit Committee participates&#13;
in oversight of the internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and the effectiveness of internal audit.&#13;
The Committee also reviews the annual internal audit plan and meets with the Auditor General in executive session. In the&#13;
execution of its role, the Committee discusses with management, the external auditors, and the internal auditors financial issues&#13;
and policies which have a bearing on IFC's financial position and risk-bearing capacity. The Audit Committee monitors the evolution&#13;
of developments in corporate governance and the role of audit committees on an ongoing basis and revised its terms of reference&#13;
in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007              129129&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
&#13;
!     The minutes of its meetings.&#13;
!     Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These reports are distributed to&#13;
      the Directors, Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management and Vice Presidents of IFC.&#13;
!     "Statement(s) of the Chairman" and statements issued by other members of the Committee.&#13;
!     The Annual Report to the Board, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the Audit Committee over the&#13;
      year.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committee's communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence section, below.&#13;
&#13;
Executive sessions&#13;
Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present. Under the&#13;
Committee's terms of reference, it meets separately in executive session with the external and internal auditors.&#13;
&#13;
Access to outside resources and to management&#13;
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, which supports the preparation of the financial&#13;
statements. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the year to discuss financial and accounting&#13;
matters. Directors have complete access to the management of IFC. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management&#13;
the quarterly and annual financial statements. The Committee also reviews with the external auditor the financial statements prior&#13;
to their publication and recommends them for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal,&#13;
accounting or other advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff. To&#13;
facilitate this effort, the World Bank Group has a Code of Professional Ethics in place. The Code (Code of Professional Ethics ­&#13;
Living our Values) applies to all staff (including managers, consultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
The Code is available in nine languages on the World Bank Group's Web site, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations, conflicts of&#13;
interest, and operational issues, including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the Code.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the Code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the Principles of&#13;
Staff Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary action. In accordance with the&#13;
Staff Rules, senior managers must complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and Business&#13;
Conduct.&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for&#13;
ensuring that internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with the World Bank Group's ethical goals. In&#13;
support of its efforts on ethics, the World Bank offers a variety of methods for informing staff of these resources. Many of these&#13;
efforts are headed by the following groups:&#13;
&#13;
!     The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct provides leadership, management and oversight for the World Bank Group's ethics&#13;
      infrastructure including the Ethics Help Line, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/ resolution system, financial&#13;
      disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and external audiences, and communication resources.&#13;
!     The Department of Institutional Integrity is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within the World&#13;
      Bank Group. The Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by World Bank Group staff, and trains and educates&#13;
      staff and clients in detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in World Bank Group-funded projects. The Department&#13;
      reports directly to the President and is composed of professionals from a range of disciplines including financial analysts,&#13;
      researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors, forensic accountants, and World Bank Group staff with operational&#13;
      experience.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group has in place procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received regarding&#13;
accounting, internal controls and auditing matters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 130          IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The World Bank Group offers both the Ethics Help Line and a Fraud and Corruption hotline run by an outside firm staffed by&#13;
trained specialists. This third-party service offers numerous methods of communication in addition to a tollfree hotline in countries&#13;
where access to telecommunications may be limited. In addition, there are other methods by which the Department of Institutional&#13;
Integrity may receive allegations, including directly by email, anonymously, or through confidential submission through its Web site,&#13;
as well as the postal service and telephone.&#13;
&#13;
Auditor independence&#13;
&#13;
In FY03, the Board adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for IFC. Key features of those&#13;
principles include:&#13;
&#13;
!    Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services;&#13;
!    All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit&#13;
     Committee;&#13;
!    Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years;&#13;
!    Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditor for more than two consecutive five-year terms;&#13;
!    Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years; and&#13;
!    An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term.&#13;
&#13;
In FY04, IFC's external auditor, Deloitte and Touche LLP, began a new five-year term and will have served eleven years as external&#13;
auditor upon completion of that term, pursuant to a one-time grandfathered exemption from the above-referenced ten-year limit.&#13;
Even within a five-year term the service of the external auditors is subject to recommendation by the Audit Committee for annual&#13;
reappointment and approval of a resolution by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
As a standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is frequently&#13;
asked to present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external auditor in private&#13;
session without management present. Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as&#13;
frequently as is deemed necessary by either party. IFC's external auditors follow the communication requirements with audit&#13;
committees set out under U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. In keeping with these standards, significant formal&#13;
communications include:&#13;
&#13;
!    Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting;&#13;
!    Annual appointment of the external auditors;&#13;
!    Presentation of the external audit plan;&#13;
!    Presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the COSO report; and&#13;
!    Presentation of a statement regarding independence.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to Committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access to the external auditor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
THE PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
International Finance Corporation (IFC), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic development in its member&#13;
countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).&#13;
IFC's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. IFC,&#13;
together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment, improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loans,&#13;
equity investments, and investments in debt securities where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC's share&#13;
capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other&#13;
debt securities in the international capital markets. IFC also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders,&#13;
either through cofinancing or through loan participations, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance, corporate lending and&#13;
resource mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial products and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to increase&#13;
their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE A ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of IFC and three variable interest entities (VIEs) (see Note W). The accounting&#13;
and reporting policies of IFC conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). On August 2, 2007,&#13;
the Board of Directors of IFC (the Board) approved these consolidated financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
Consolidated financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's&#13;
presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Use of estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect&#13;
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements&#13;
and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A significant&#13;
degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy of the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity&#13;
investments; estimated fair values of all derivative instruments and related financial instruments in qualifying hedging relationships; and net periodic&#13;
pension income or expense. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to IFC's operations. The possibility exists that changing economic&#13;
conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
IFC uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments and the aggregate level of the reserve against losses&#13;
on loans and impairment of equity investments. IFC undertakes continuous review and respecification of these models with the objective of refining&#13;
its estimates, consistent with evolving best practices appropriate to its operations. Changes in estimates resulting from refinements in the assumptions&#13;
and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period in which the enhanced models are first applied.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies - Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity investments,&#13;
are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006. Disbursed equity investments are expressed in US&#13;
dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are recorded based on the rates of exchange prevailing at&#13;
the time of the transaction. Transaction gains and losses are credited or charged to income. Translation adjustments on equity investments that are&#13;
accounted for under the equity method are recorded in other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans - IFC originates loans to facilitate project finance, restructuring, refinancing, corporate finance, and/or other developmental objectives. Loans&#13;
are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are carried at the principal amounts outstanding adjusted for net unamortized loan origination costs&#13;
and fees. It is IFC's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on loans - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. Beginning in the year&#13;
ended June 30, 2006, IFC began amortizing net loan origination costs and fees over the estimated life of the originated loan to which the fees relate.&#13;
Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006, loan origination costs were expensed as incurred, and loan origination fees were recognized as income when&#13;
received. The net of loan origination fees and loan origination costs was considered insignificant. All other fees are recorded as income when&#13;
received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days unless&#13;
management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed&#13;
out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as&#13;
part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the consolidated balance sheet in payables and other liabilities, and credited&#13;
to income only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the reserve against losses on loans&#13;
in the consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans - IFC recognizes impairment on loans in the consolidated balance sheet through the reserve against losses on&#13;
loans, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans in net income on a quarterly basis, which increases or decreases the reserve&#13;
against losses on loans. Individually impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows to be received,&#13;
observable market prices, or for loans that are dependent on collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  142            IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans, taking into account established guidelines and its assessment of&#13;
recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines include internal country and loan risk ratings, and the impairment potential of the loan portfolio based&#13;
on IFC's historical portfolio loss experience on mature loans.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable losses inherent in the portfolio but not&#13;
specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of the creditworthiness of the borrower&#13;
and is established through review of individual loans undertaken on a quarterly basis. IFC considers a loan as impaired when, based on current&#13;
information and events, it is probable that IFC will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. Unidentified&#13;
probable losses are the expected losses over a three-year risk horizon, in excess of identified probable losses. The risks inherent in the portfolio that&#13;
are considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to exist by past experience and include: country systemic risk; the risk of&#13;
correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks; nonperformance under guarantees and support agreements;&#13;
and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Loans are written-off when IFC has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve against losses on loans. Such reductions in the&#13;
reserve are offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off loans.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - IFC invests for current income, capital appreciation, developmental impact, or all three; IFC does not seek to take operational,&#13;
controlling, or strategic equity positions within its investees. Equity investments are acquired through direct ownership of equity instruments of&#13;
investees, as a limited partner in limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs), and/or as an investor in a private equity fund.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on equity investments - Direct equity investments in which IFC does not have significant influence and certain investments&#13;
in investment companies are carried at cost less impairment. IFC's investments in companies where it has significant influence and certain investments&#13;
in LLPs and LLCs that maintain specific ownership accounts are accounted for under the equity method. IFC's investments in certain private equity&#13;
funds in which IFC is deemed to be the Primary Beneficiary of a VIE, as the presumption of control by the fund manager or the general partner has&#13;
been overcome, are fully consolidated into IFC's books. Certain equity investments, for which recovery of invested capital is uncertain, are accounted&#13;
for under the cost recovery method, such that receipts of freely convertible currencies are first applied to recovery of invested capital and then to&#13;
income from equity investments. The cost recovery method is principally applied to IFC's investments in its oil and gas unincorporated joint ventures&#13;
(UJVs). Conditional asset retirement obligations related to investments in UJVs are recorded when the fair value of the obligations can be&#13;
reasonably estimated. The obligations are capitalized and systematically amortized over the estimated economic useful lives.&#13;
&#13;
Dividends and profit participations received on cost method equity investments are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible&#13;
currencies. Realized capital gains on the sale or redemption of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and&#13;
are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies or securities, which are readily convertible into freely convertible&#13;
currencies. Capital losses are recognized when incurred.&#13;
&#13;
IFC enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in accordance with Statement of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of equity investments - Equity investments are assessed for impairment each quarter. When an impairment is identified and is&#13;
deemed to be other than temporary, the equity investment is written down to the impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis in the equity&#13;
investment. Impairment losses are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
Debt securities - Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with unrealized gains&#13;
and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Interest on debt securities is included in interest and financial fees&#13;
from loans on the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees - IFC extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and trade obligations. IFC&#13;
offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the terms of IFC's&#13;
guarantees, IFC agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client (i.e., failure to pay when&#13;
payment is due). Guarantees are regarded as issued when IFC commits to the guarantee. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the&#13;
underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and this date is considered to be the "inception" of the guarantee. Guarantees are regarded&#13;
as called when IFC's obligation under the guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the guarantees: (1) the stand-ready&#13;
obligation to perform and (2) the contingent liability. The stand-ready obligation to perform is recognized at the inception of the guarantee unless a&#13;
contingent liability exists at that time or is expected to exist in the near term. The contingent liability associated with the financial guarantee is&#13;
recognized when it is probable the guarantee will be called and when the amount of guarantee called can be reasonably estimated. All liabilities&#13;
associated with guarantees are included in payables and other liabilities, and the receivables are included in other assets on the consolidated balance&#13;
sheet. When the guarantees are called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new loan, and specific reserves against losses are established, based&#13;
on the estimated probable loss. These reserves are included in the reserve against losses on loans on the consolidated balance sheet. Guarantee fees&#13;
are recorded in income as the stand-ready obligation to perform is fulfilled. Commitment fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual&#13;
basis.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                 IFC ANNUAL REPORT 2007                  143143&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings - In the year ended June 30, 2004, IFC established a funding mechanism for technical assistance and advisory&#13;
services through a designation of retained earnings. Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2007, technical assistance and advisory services are now&#13;
referred to as advisory services. In the year ended June 30, 2005, IFC established a funding mechanism for performance-based grants (PBG)&#13;
through a designation of retained earnings. Further, in the year ended June 30, 2006, IFC also designated retained earnings for grants to IDA for&#13;
use by IDA in the provision of grants to further IFC's mandates in certain IDA member countries. Total designations of retained earnings for&#13;
advisory services, PBG, and grants to IDA are determined based on IFC's annual income before expenditures for advisory services, expenditures for&#13;
PBG, grants to IDA and net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments in excess of $150 million, and contemplating the financial&#13;
capacity and strategic priorities of IFC. Expenditures for advisory services, PBG, and grants to IDA are recorded as expenses in IFC's consolidated&#13;
income statement in the year in which they occur, also having the effect of reducing the respective designated retained earnings for such purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures are deemed to have occurred when IFC has ceded control of the funds to the recipient. If the recipient organization is deemed to be&#13;
controlled by IFC, the expenditure is deemed to have occurred only when the recipient organization expends the funds to a non-related party. On&#13;
occasion, recipient organizations which are deemed to be controlled by IFC will acquire certain investment assets other than cash. These&#13;
investments have had no material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In such cases, IFC includes those assets on&#13;
its consolidated balance sheet, where they remain until the recipient organization disposes of or transfers the asset or IFC is deemed to no longer&#13;
be in control of the recipient organization.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio - IFC's liquid funds are invested in government, agency and government-sponsored agency obligations, time deposits and&#13;
asset-backed securities. Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills, and other&#13;
obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and&#13;
instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by IFC, consists of: time deposits and securities; related&#13;
derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements and payable for cash collateral&#13;
received; receivables from sales of securities and payables for purchases of securities; and related accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
Securities within IFC's liquid asset portfolio are classified as trading and are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in income from&#13;
liquid asset trading activities. Interest on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are also reported in income from liquid&#13;
asset trading activities.&#13;
&#13;
IFC classifies cash and due from banks and time deposits (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in the consolidated&#13;
statement of cash flows because they are generally readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days of acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees to&#13;
repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases securities&#13;
and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
It is IFC's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government securities. The market&#13;
value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained when their value declines.&#13;
IFC also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the agreements,&#13;
requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the securities were&#13;
acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities&#13;
payable for cash collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, IFC borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of&#13;
borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, IFC simultaneously converts&#13;
such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain outstanding&#13;
borrowing agreements, IFC is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security interests)&#13;
without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts. Where borrowings are&#13;
part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to&#13;
the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are reported in net gains and losses on non-trading financial&#13;
instruments in the consolidated income statement. Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in&#13;
charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Risk management, derivative instruments, and hedge accounting - IFC enters into transactions in various derivative instruments for financial&#13;
risk management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk management, borrowing, liquid asset&#13;
portfolio management and asset and liability management. IFC does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.&#13;
&#13;
All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they are not&#13;
clearly and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, equity investments, and market borrowing&#13;
transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999, are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and&#13;
liabilities. The value at inception of such embedded derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the consolidated&#13;
balance sheet. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in income from liquid&#13;
asset trading activities. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments other than those used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are&#13;
recorded in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments.&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, as amended, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the fair&#13;
value of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow&#13;
hedge). For a derivative instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in net income,&#13;
together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument&#13;
qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income and&#13;
released to net income in the period(s) in which the effect on net income of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and losses on a derivative&#13;
instrument not qualifying as a hedge are reported in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges. IFC generally matches the terms of its derivatives with&#13;
the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other&#13;
features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument may differ. The resulting&#13;
ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments in the consolidated income&#13;
statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of IFC's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are described below.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities IFC's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative instruments are used to&#13;
convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars. IFC has elected not to designate hedging&#13;
relationships for all lending-related derivatives.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities IFC enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency, interest rate, or&#13;
commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of IFC's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that arise from these transactions with&#13;
clients, IFC enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all&#13;
derivatives associated with these activities are reflected currently in net income. Though hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the&#13;
matching of terms between the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net income in net gains (losses) on non-financial instruments. Fees&#13;
and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities IFC issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying funding&#13;
sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in&#13;
multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a&#13;
reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. IFC uses derivative instruments with matching terms, primarily&#13;
currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with IFC's matched funding policy.&#13;
IFC has designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There are a small&#13;
number of fair value-like and cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge relationship has been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio management activities IFC manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain of the time&#13;
deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those instruments into&#13;
variable rate US dollars, consistent with IFC's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter foreign&#13;
exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the entire liquid&#13;
asset portfolio is classified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value, and no hedging relationships have been&#13;
designated.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, IFC faces residual market risk&#13;
in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and&#13;
reducing the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is reduced by&#13;
synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate basis. Interest rate risk arising from&#13;
mismatches due to writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the&#13;
present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
IFC monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients and counterparties.&#13;
 In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the credit rating and size of the&#13;
individual counterparty. In addition, IFC has entered into master agreements governing derivative transactions that contain close-out and netting&#13;
provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if IFC's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a&#13;
specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations - IFC mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating loan participations,&#13;
without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by IFC on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed and outstanding&#13;
balances of loan participations that meet the applicable accounting criteria are accounted for as sales and are not included in IFC's consolidated&#13;
balance sheet. All other loan participations are accounted for as secured borrowings and are included in loans on IFC's consolidated balance sheet,&#13;
with the related secured borrowings included in payables and other liabilities on the IFC's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;

Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a&#13;
Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of IFC and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to eligible&#13;
retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC, and&#13;
MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans.          In addition, IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any&#13;
contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to IFC is included in income or expense from pension and&#13;
other postretirement benefit plans in the consolidated income statement. IFC includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other assets,&#13;
representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;
&#13;
Variable Interest Entities - In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of&#13;
Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December 2003, FASB replaced FIN 46 with FASB Interpretation No. 46,&#13;
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R define certain VIEs and require parties to&#13;
such entities to assess and measure variable interests in the VIEs for the purpose of determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Variable interests&#13;
can arise from financial instruments, service contracts, guarantees, leases or other arrangements with a VIE. An entity that will absorb a majority of&#13;
a VIE's expected losses or expected residual returns is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and must include the assets, liabilities, and&#13;
results of operations of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has a number of investments in VIEs which it manages and supervises in a manner consistent with other portfolio investments. Note W&#13;
provides further details regarding IFC's variable interests in VIEs.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments ­ During the year ended June 30, 2006, IFC changed its accounting principle with respect to&#13;
the amortization of loan origination fees and loan origination costs. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006, the net of loan origination fees and costs&#13;
was considered to be insignificant. Beginning in year ended June 30, 2006, IFC began amortizing loan origination fees and costs on an effective yield&#13;
basis.&#13;
&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments - an amendment of FASB&#13;
Statements Nos. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155) and SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement&#13;
No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). Both SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156 are effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006, which would be&#13;
the year ending June 30, 2008 for IFC. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial&#13;
position, results of operations or cash flow of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No.&#13;
158). SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize on their balance sheet the funded status of their defined benefit postretirement plans,&#13;
measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations, and to recognize as part of Other Comprehensive&#13;
Income the gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period to the extent they are not recognized as components of&#13;
the net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, upon adoption, SFAS No. 158 requires the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss and the unrecognized&#13;
prior service cost to be recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and that these amounts be adjusted as they are subsequently&#13;
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, based upon the current amortization and recognition requirements of SFAS No. 87,&#13;
Employers' Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits (SFAS No. 106). SFAS No.&#13;
158 is applicable to IFC's consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2007 and the impact of its adoption is discussed further in Note S.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a fair&#13;
value hierarchy and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,&#13;
2007, which would be the year ending June 30, 2009 for IFC. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet&#13;
issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including any financial statements for an interim period within the fiscal year of adoption. IFC is&#13;
currently planning to early adopt SFAS No. 157 beginning in the year ending June 30, 2008 and is evaluating the effects of this new standard.&#13;
&#13;
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of&#13;
FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value measurement for certain financial assets&#13;
and financial liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which would&#13;
be the year ending June 30, 2009 for IFC. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year (the year ending June 30, 2008&#13;
for IFC) as long as the entity also early adopts SFAS No. 157 concurrent with the adoption of SFAS No. 159. IFC is currently planning to early adopt&#13;
SFAS No. 159 and to elect fair value measurement for virtually all of its market borrowings and certain equity investments. IFC is currently assessing&#13;
the potential impact of any such early adoption on the financial position, results of operations or cash flow of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
In November 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue No. 06-9, Reporting a Change in (or&#13;
the Elimination of) a Previously Existing Difference Between the Fiscal Year-End of a Parent Company and That of a Consolidated Entity or Between&#13;
the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee (EITF 06-9). EITF 06-9 is effective for IFC beginning on January 31, 2007.&#13;
The adoption of EITF No. 06-9 did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flow of IFC.&#13;

In June 2007, the American institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position No. 07-1 (SOP No 07-1), Clarification of&#13;
the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for&#13;
Investments in Investment Companies. SOP No. 07-1 provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of the AICPA Audit&#13;
and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the Guide). Investment Companies that are within the scope of the Guide report investments at&#13;
fair value. SOP No. 07-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007, which would be the year ending June 30, 2009 for&#13;
IFC. IFC is currently evaluating the provisions of SOP No. 07-1.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2007, the FASB issued and/or approved various FASB Staff Positions, EITF Issues Notes, and other&#13;
interpretative guidance related to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinions. IFC analyzed and&#13;
implemented the new guidance, as appropriate, with no material impact on either the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of IFC.&#13;

NOTE E ­ GUARANTEES&#13;
&#13;
Under the terms of IFC's guarantees, IFC agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client,&#13;
where default is defined as failure to pay when payment is due. Guarantees entered into by IFC generally have maturities consistent with those of the&#13;
loan portfolio. Guarantees signed at June 30, 2007, totaled $1,414 million ($1,150 million - June 30, 2006). Guarantees of $808 million that were&#13;
outstanding (i.e., not called) at June 30, 2007 ($494 million - June 30, 2006), were not included in loans on the IFC's consolidated balance sheet. The&#13;
outstanding amount represents the maximum amount of undiscounted future payments that IFC could be required to make under these guarantees.&#13;

NOTE L ­ CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS&#13;
&#13;
IFC's authorized share capital was increased to $2,450 million through two capital increases in 1992. The subscription and payment period for&#13;
shares then allocated ended on August 1, 1999, but IFC has agreed to defer the payment date for certain member countries beyond this date.&#13;
Pursuant to these arrangements, $1 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2007 ($1 million - June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2007, 100 shares were subscribed and paid by member countries at a par value of $1,000 each ($0 - year ended&#13;
June 30, 2006; 1,615 - year ended June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Under IFC's Articles of Agreement, in the event a member withdraws from IFC, IFC and the member may negotiate on the repurchase of the&#13;
member's capital stock on such terms as may be appropriate under the circumstances. Such agreement may provide, among other things, for a&#13;
final settlement of all obligations of the member to IFC. If such an agreement is not made within six months after the member withdraws or such&#13;
other time as IFC and the member may agree, the repurchase price of the member's capital stock shall be the value thereof shown by the books of&#13;
IFC on the day when the member withdraws. The repurchase of capital stock is subject to certain conditions including payments in installments, at&#13;
such times and in such available currency or currencies as IFC reasonably determines, taking into account the financial position of IFC. IFC's Articles&#13;
of Agreement also provide for the withdrawing member to repay losses on loans and equity investments in excess of reserves provided on the date&#13;
of withdrawal.&#13;

NOTE P ­ DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Many of IFC's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of future cash flows&#13;
are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in&#13;
assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying&#13;
amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since IFC generally holds loans, borrowings and other&#13;
financial instruments with contractual maturities with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006. In different interest rate environments, the&#13;
fair value of IFC's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable&#13;
comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous&#13;
estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of&#13;
subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is&#13;
required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of IFC. The fair values of the individual financial&#13;
instruments do not represent the fair value of IFC taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006, are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and the present&#13;
value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other&#13;
derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and loan commitments - IFC generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair values&#13;
for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed rate&#13;
loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on a quarterly or&#13;
semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. IFC also holds options to convert&#13;
loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated&#13;
values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment were determined using market prices where available,&#13;
put option prices, book values or cost, certain of which were discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value. Where market&#13;
prices were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Fair values of&#13;
investments in LLPs and certain LLCs, other equity method investments and equity investments held by consolidated VIEs are not included.&#13;

NOTE Q ­ CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
IFC conducts its operations for its loans, time deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. IFC's policy is to minimize the level of&#13;
currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-equity investments) and liabilities by using&#13;
hedging instruments. IFC's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing member countries are typically made in the local currency of&#13;
the country. As a matter of policy, IFC carries the currency risk of equity investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from&#13;
its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

The following table summarizes IFC's exposure in major currencies at June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006 (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE R ­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
For management purposes, IFC's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment consists primarily&#13;
of lending, debt securities and equity investment activities. Operationally, the treasury services segment consists of the borrowing, liquid asset&#13;
management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities. Consistent with internal reporting, net income (expense) from&#13;
asset and liability management and client risk management activities in support of client services are allocated to the client services segment.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
employed. IFC's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each segment. Consistent&#13;
with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and segment head counts.&#13;
Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
The accounting policies of IFC's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in Note A, "Summary of Significant Accounting&#13;
and Related Policies."&#13;
&#13;
An analysis of IFC's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006, and June 30,&#13;
2005, is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE S ­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
IBRD, IFC and MIGA participate in a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits&#13;
Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to eligible&#13;
retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
&#13;
IFC uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The amounts presented below reflect IFC's respective&#13;
share of the costs, assets and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA based upon their employees'&#13;
respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. IDA,&#13;
IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD. Contributions to these plans are&#13;
calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;

&#13;
The expenses for the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP are included in expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For the fiscal years ended&#13;
June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006, and June 30, 2005, expenses for these plans of $16 million, $28 million and $16 million, respectively, were allocated&#13;
to IFC. IFC's net expense for these plans reported in the consolidated income statement was $15 million, $28 million, and $14 million for the fiscal&#13;
years ended June 30, 2007, June 30, 2006, and June 30, 2005, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
As described in Note A under Accounting and financial reporting developments, on June 30, 2007, IFC prospectively adopted SFAS No. 158 as&#13;
required, which resulted in a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income of $246 million. Further details are provided in the disclosures&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with the SRP, RSBP, and&#13;
PEBP for IFC for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006 (US$ millions). Since the assets for the PEBP are not held in an irrevocable&#13;
trust separate from the assets of IBRD, they do not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting and are therefore included in IBRD's investment portfolio.&#13;
 IFC has recognized a receivable (prepaid asset) from IBRD and a payable (liability) to IBRD equal to the amount required to support the plan. The&#13;
assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed income instruments.&#13;

In December 2003, the United States Medicare Prescription Dug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted. The Act&#13;
established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that&#13;
provided a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the U.S. Center for&#13;
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved IBRD's participation in the Medicare Retiree Drug Subsidy Program. The effects of the subsidy and&#13;
the related disclosures have been reflected in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the year in which IBRD received its&#13;
first subsidy payment of $0.7 million for Medicare Part D. This payment is for the joint benefit of IBRD, IFC and MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit&#13;
changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the various&#13;
asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach and are not&#13;
strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and&#13;
expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium/spread&#13;
(as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-term rate of return for&#13;
the RSBP is computed using procedures similar to those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by&#13;
reference to the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses will be&#13;
included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-&#13;
related value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service lives of the&#13;
employee group.&#13;

Investment strategy&#13;
&#13;
The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's needs and goals,&#13;
using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that incorporates&#13;
expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the respective plans. This analysis,&#13;
referred to as an asset-liability analysis, also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future asset and liability balances. Plan assets are&#13;
managed by external investment managers and monitored by IBRD's pension investment department. The pension plan assets are invested in&#13;
diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments. The fixed-income and public equity asset classes are rebalanced on a&#13;
monthly basis.&#13;
&#13;

Expected contributions&#13;
&#13;
IFC's contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee, which bases its judgment on the&#13;
results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of contributions expected to&#13;
be paid to the SRP and RSBP for IFC during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, is $30 million and $8 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE T ­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
IFC obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by IBRD. This&#13;
includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal auditing, administrative support,&#13;
supplies, and insurance. IFC makes payments for these services to IBRD based on negotiated fees, chargebacks and allocated charges, where&#13;
chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to IFC for the year ended June 30, 2007, were $28 million ($23 million - year ended June 30, 2006;&#13;
$25 million - year ended June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE U ­ MANAGEMENT OF EXTERNAL FUNDS&#13;
&#13;
IFC administers funds (Trust Funds) on behalf of donors that are restricted for specific uses in accordance with administration agreements with&#13;
donors. Specified uses could include, for example, Advisory Services including feasibility studies, project preparation, and implementing global and&#13;
regional programs, and research and training programs. These donor funds are placed in trust and are held in a separate investment portfolio&#13;
which is not commingled with IFC's funds, nor are they included in the assets of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Trust fund execution may be carried out in one of three ways: Recipient-executed, IFC-executed or Limited fiduciary arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
IFC-executed Trust Funds involve IFC execution of activities as described in relevant administration agreements with donors which define the terms&#13;
and conditions for use of the funds. Spending authority is exercised by IFC, subject to any restrictions contained in the administration agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Recipient-executed Trust Funds involve activities carried out by a recipient third-party "executing agency." IFC enters into agreements with and&#13;
disburses funds to these recipients, who then exercise spending authority to meet the objectives and comply with terms stipulated in the&#13;
agreements.&#13;
&#13;
IFC also enters into Limited fiduciary arrangements under which IFC's services are limited to the role of fiscal agent. Funds are held and disbursed in&#13;
accordance with instructions from the donors or donors' external governance structure.&#13;
&#13;
The distribution of Trust Fund assets at June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006, are summarized below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE V ­ CONTINGENCIES&#13;
&#13;
In the normal course of its business, IFC is from time to time named as a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions on different grounds in&#13;
various jurisdictions. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, IFC's Management does not believe the&#13;
outcome of any of the various existing legal actions will have a material adverse effect on IFC's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE W ­ VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND OTHER CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS&#13;
&#13;
An entity is subject to FIN 46R and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it lacks: (1) equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its&#13;
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (2) equity investors who have decision-making rights about the&#13;
entity's operations or who do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity proportionally to their voting rights.&#13;
&#13;
A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party involved with the VIE that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a&#13;
majority of the expected residual returns or both. The primary beneficiary is required to initially measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling&#13;
interests of the VIE at their carrying amounts at the date on which it first became the primary beneficiary. Because certain VIEs were created prior&#13;
to the issuance of FIN 46R, it may not be practicable to determine the carrying amounts of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at the&#13;
initial date, and in such cases, the primary beneficiary must measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the date&#13;
FIN 46R is first applied. The primary beneficiary is also required to disclose information about the nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE,&#13;
and collateral and recourse creditors may have against the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise may hold significant variable interests in VIEs which are not consolidated because the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary. In such&#13;
cases, the enterprise is required to disclose information about its involvement with and exposure to the VIE, and about the nature, purpose, size,&#13;
and activities of the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise is not required to apply FIN 46R to certain entities if, after making an exhaustive effort, it is unable to obtain the information&#13;
necessary to: (1) determine whether the entity is a VIE; (2) determine if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the possible VIE; or (3) perform&#13;
the accounting required to consolidate a possible VIE. In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose the number of entities to which FIN 46R is&#13;
not being applied, why the information required to apply FIN 46R is not available, the nature, purpose and activities of the entities to which FIN 46R&#13;
is not being applied, and the enterprise's maximum exposure to the entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied.&#13;
&#13;
Primary beneficiary&#13;
&#13;
IFC has identified six VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary at June 30, 2007 (seven entities - June 30, 2006). Three of the VIEs&#13;
in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have been consolidated into IFC's consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2007 (four&#13;
entities - June 30, 2006). All consolidated VIEs are in the Collective investment vehicles sector in the Latin America and Caribbean region.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the consolidation of the three investments described above, IFC's consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2007 includes additional&#13;
assets of $12 million in equity investments ($6 million - June 30, 2006), $3 million in receivables and other assets ($3 million - June 30, 2006), and&#13;
additional liabilities of $4 million in payables and other liabilities ($2 million - June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Other income for the year ended June 30, 2007 includes $7 million of income from consolidated entities ($17 million - year ended June 30, 2006;&#13;
$5 million - year ended June 30, 2005) and other expense includes $2 million of expenses from consolidated entities ($10 million - year ended June&#13;
30, 2006; $5 million - year ended June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
The remaining three VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have not been consolidated into IFC's consolidated financial&#13;
statements, as they are significantly impaired and information required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R is not available. Based on the most recent&#13;
financial data available, total net assets of the three entities is $11 million. IFC's net investment in these three entities totals $2 million, virtually all in&#13;
the primary metals sector in the Asia region.&#13;

Significant variable interests&#13;
&#13;
IFC has identified 27 investments in VIEs in which IFC is not the primary beneficiary but in which it is deemed to hold significant variable interests at&#13;
June 30, 2007 (14 - June 30, 2006). Based on the most recent available data from these VIEs, the size including committed funding of the VIEs in&#13;
which IFC is deemed to hold significant variable interests totaled $1,639 million at June 30, 2007 ($602 million - June 30, 2006). IFC's total&#13;
investment in and maximum exposure to loss to these investments in VIEs in which IFC is deemed to hold significant variable interests, comprising&#13;
both disbursed amounts and amounts committed but not yet disbursed, was $367 million at June 30, 2007 ($108 million - June 30, 2006). The&#13;
regional and sectoral analysis of IFC's investments in these VIEs at June 30, 2007, is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTES AND DEFINITIONS&#13;
&#13;
The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY07 began on July 1, 2006, and ended on June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Investment amounts are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.&#13;
&#13;
On-lending is the process of lending funds from IFC's own sources through intermediaries, such as local banks and&#13;
microfinance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of projects, but because IFC is the lender of record,&#13;
participants receive the same tax and country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status as a multilateral&#13;
financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features, which are designed to provide varying degrees&#13;
of risk/return trade-offs that lie between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of individual figures in some tables.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank includes both IBRD and IDA. The World Bank Group includes IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2007 : creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Finance Corporation
            (IFC) set a record in fiscal 2007 for new investment
            commitments. This report explores IFC's increasing
            development impact and provides information on its
            investments and other activities for the fiscal year. The
            Board of Directors maintained close oversight of the
            IFC's efforts to increase and measure its development
            impact. Directors reaffirmed their support for the
            IFC's strategic directions, including more specific
            emphasis on agribusiness and small and medium enterprises,
            as well as IFC's growth strategy. The Board approved a
            number of investments and joint World Bank-IFC-Multilateral
            Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) country assistance
            strategies and continued to encourage stronger
            collaboration, both across the World Bank Group and with
            partners and stakeholders. Specific issues that Directors
            discussed with management included IFC's strategy for
            Africa, the joint Bank Group strategy for the financial
            sector, the launch of a new IFC-World Bank department
            focusing on sub-national finance, and several proposals for
            new products and services with potential to expand
            IFC's reach in client countries. The Board continued to
            monitor new methods for measuring outcomes of IFC's
            investments and advisory services, as well as progress in
            implementing IFC's environmental and social performance
            standards. The Board welcomed IFC's strong performance
            in FY07. These include record levels of financing and
            expansion of advisory activity in Africa and the Middle
            East, as well as measurable progress in a number of frontier
            markets and strategic sectors.
