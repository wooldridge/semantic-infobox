             EconomicManagementandGrowthCredit (Cr.No. 4009-ZA)&#13;
                   Releaseofthe SecondTranche-FullCompliance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              I.            BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
 1.        On December 14, 2004 the Board of Executive Directors o f the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) approved the Economic Management and Growth&#13;
 Credit (EMGC), a structural adjustment credit, for the Republic o f Zambia inthe amount&#13;
o f SDR27.4 million (US$40 million equivalent). The Credit, a two tranche operation o f&#13;
 SDR13.7 million each, was declared effective on December 21,2004 and the first tranche&#13;
released on December 26,2004.&#13;
&#13;
2.         Inview o fthe overall performance andprogress withthe implementationofthe&#13;
program supported by the Credit, and in compliance with the specific conditions o f&#13;
release referred in paragraph (d) o f section 2.02 and listed in Schedule 2 o f the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement, the Second Tranche o f SDR13.7 million, equivalent to&#13;
US$19.8 millionat current exchange rates, can be released to the Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
3.        The EMGC is the first development policy operation to support policy and&#13;
institutional reforms as envisioned in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the&#13;
period 2004-07 (Report No. 27654-ZA).          The CAS envisaged that over the four-year&#13;
period o f CAS implementation, there could be at least two development policy lending&#13;
operations.   This credit assists Zambia to: (a) return to a macroeconomic framework&#13;
conducive to robust growth; (b) strengthen the role o f the financial sector; (c) strengthen&#13;
the credibility and institutional capacity o f the public sector; and (d) improve Zambia's&#13;
business environment. IDA and the Government o f the Republic o f Zambia (GRZ) agree&#13;
that achieving these objectives inpart depends on the implementation o f specific reforms&#13;
inthe areas of: (i)pensions and payment culture among Government agencies; (ii)        state&#13;
owned non-bank financial institutions; (iii)public expenditure management, debt&#13;
management, and civil service reform; and (iv) private sector development including&#13;
regulation o fpublic utilities and private business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            11.            RECENT ECONOMICPERFORMANCE&#13;
&#13;
4.        Performance under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)&#13;
supported macroeconomic program has been positive. Economic growth has been robust&#13;
and broad based.     Strong performance o f non-traditional exports combined with a&#13;
resurgence o f copper prices and production, have greatly improved Zambia's external&#13;
accounts. In addition, reaching the HIPC Completion point in early 2005 has wiped out&#13;
approximately US$4 billion o f Zambia's external debt stock greatly reducing GRZ's&#13;
external debt service and improving its external creditworthiness and solvability. The&#13;
proposed Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI) will further reduce Zambia's&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 external debt to just about US$0.6 billion. At the same time fiscal policy has beenput on&#13;
 a sustainable trajectory and has become more predictable through the introduction o f a&#13;
 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Even though levels o f inflation and&#13;
 interest rates remain fairly hgh, monetary policy has been relatively tight.&#13;
&#13;
 5.         Zambia is experiencing a robust growth period with positive per capita GDP&#13;
 growth for seven consecutive years and with all sectors positively contributing. This&#13;
 contrasts sharply to the early period o f reform o f 1991-1998. As a consequence, the&#13;
 overall poverty headcount has declined from 73 percent in 1998 to 68 percent at the end&#13;
 o f 2004.   Even though this decline is less than needed to reach the poverty related&#13;
 Millennium Development Goal (MDG), which aims to reduce the proportion o f&#13;
 Zambians whose income is less than one dollar a day by 50 percent between 1990 and&#13;
 2015, the decline is a welcome outcome after decades o f decreasing incomes and&#13;
 increasing poverty. Real GDP Growth i s estimated to equal 4.3 percent for 2005 albeit&#13;
 the country experienced a drought for the 2004/05 farming season and witnessed serious&#13;
 fuel shortages in the fall o f 2005 because o f an unanticipated production failure at the&#13;
 local refinery.&#13;
&#13;
 6.         These positive growth and poverty developments are supported and for a large&#13;
part driven by favorable external developments. Zambia's terms o f trade improved by&#13;
21.9 percent and an estimated 2.1 percent in2004 and 2005 respectively. This has led to&#13;
a decline inits current account deficit after grants from 7.5 percent o f GDP in2003 to 3.7&#13;
percent in 2004 and an estimated 4.6 percent for 2005.           The main source o f this&#13;
improvement is the exceptional rise in copper prices by approximately 100 percent&#13;
between 2003 and 2005.         This combined with a recovery in copper production has&#13;
allowed growth o f export proceeds to outperform increases in imports. Imports rose&#13;
sharply during this period as well triggered by rising fuel costs and imports of related&#13;
investment goods for the mining sector inparticular. Inaddition, non traditional exports&#13;
have also grown rapidly amounting to an estimated US$540 million for 2005 up by 115&#13;
percent compared to its US$ level in 2000. As a result, overall export levels measured in&#13;
US$ in 2005 are estimated to amount to US$2.1 billion, almost three times the leveI o f&#13;
exports in2000.&#13;
&#13;
7.         These improvements inthe external environment have resulted in a buildup o f&#13;
international reserves which stand now at 1.4 months o f imports, still a relatively low&#13;
level, but up from less than 1month o f imports at the beginning o f this millennium. The&#13;
favorable external developments have impacted the Kwacha, which has been appreciating&#13;
inrealterms by approximately 8 percent annually in2003 and2004, andappreciated over&#13;
17 percent alone over the first 8 months o f 2005.       The impact o f this appreciation,&#13;
brought about by a fundamental improvement in Zambia's external environment, on its&#13;
competitiveness can be curtailed if it i s matched by increasing productivity and reducing&#13;
the cost o f doing business.&#13;
&#13;
8.         After years o f weak fiscal policy implementation, the authorities have&#13;
improved budget execution and reduced its domestic financing needs drastically.&#13;
Domestic borrowing was reduced from 5.1 percent in2003 to 0.8 percent in2004, which&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 has crowded in credit resources available to the private sector and reduced yields on&#13;
 bonds and T Bills significantly. In 2005, the overall fiscal deficit i s estimated to be&#13;
 around 2.7 percent o f GDP, up slightly from a low 1.7 percent deficit in2004. Under the&#13;
 recently issued Medium Term Expenditure Framework for the period 2006-08, domestic&#13;
 borrowing is expected to remain subdued allowing domestic resources to be increasingly&#13;
 channeled through the banking system to much needed private investment.&#13;
&#13;
 9.        The reduction o f the deficit from 6.6 percent in 2003 to an estimated 2.7&#13;
 percent o f GDP for 2005, has basically taken the fiscal angle out o f inflation.&#13;
 Nevertheless, inflation remains relatively high and stood at 17.2 percent for November&#13;
 2005, 1.1 percent lower, than the CPI inflation for November 2004. The smaller than&#13;
 anticipated reduction in inflation i s mostly caused by the effect o f the drought on food&#13;
 prices and the increase in oil prices on the world market. Monetary policy itself has&#13;
 become tighter with growth in broad money falling from 60 percent in 2000 to an&#13;
 estimated 18 percent in2005.&#13;
&#13;
 10.       The Government is in the process of preparing its next National Development&#13;
Plan, which will cover the period 2006-10 and which is to focus on growth and its&#13;
contribution to poverty reduction. It i s recognized that through fiscal consolidation and&#13;
public expenditure management reforms e.g. introduction o f program budgeting and&#13;
commitment control mechanisms in particular, the government is in a better position to&#13;
provide not only a growthhvestment conducive macro economic environment but also&#13;
to better direct its expenditure programs to those in need and on those public investment&#13;
programs and services that will allow the poor to be able to more fully participate in and&#13;
benefit fi-om the current economic growth momentum inZambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 111.          PROGRESSAGAINST TRANCHE RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
11.        The Government has maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework.&#13;
This has been confirmed by a positive second review under the PRGF arrangement,&#13;
which was concluded on April 8, 2005. Zambia's current three-year arrangement in the&#13;
amount o f SDR220.1 million was approved by the IMF Board on June 16, 2004. Its&#13;
Executive Board is tentatively scheduled to conduct the third review o f the program on&#13;
January 11,2006. IMF staff has informed IDA that performance under the program has&#13;
been broadly satisfactory. All quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for the&#13;
third review, which is based on program benchmarks for June 2005, were met, while all&#13;
but one o f the performance criteria for end-September was met. Under the structural&#13;
program, all performance criteria have been met. Some benchmarks were, however,&#13;
implemented with some delay.&#13;
&#13;
12.        The conditions o f release referred inparagraph (d) o f section 2.02 and listed in&#13;
Schedule 2 o f the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) betweenthe Borrower and IDA&#13;
dated Decemberl6, 2004, state that for the release o f the second tranche the following&#13;
milestones mustbe fulfilled:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 4 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Milestone1: TheBorrower's Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) has&#13;
 adopted a time-bound restructuringplanfor payment of the Borrower 's arrears to utility&#13;
 and insurance companies in accordance withparagraph 9 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
 13.        This milestonehas been met. The Borrower has made separate arrangements&#13;
with each o fthe relevant utility andinsurance companies to dismantle the stock o f arrears&#13;
 ina time boundmanner. Inaddition, to strengthen oversight and control over the utility&#13;
payments and insurance premiums, the MoFNP has decided to pay all utility bills and&#13;
 insurance premiums directly from the Treasury and debit the transfers it makes to the&#13;
 government agencies that are beingbilledby the utilities andthe insurance companies.&#13;
&#13;
Milestone 2: The Borrower's Cabinet has approved a financial reform program for&#13;
Public Sector Pension Fund (PSPF) including: (a) a proposal to the Constitutional&#13;
Review Commission to change theprovisions of article 124 of the Constitution; and (b) a&#13;
reform program for PSPF that ensures the Jinancial sustainability of the fund, all in&#13;
accordance with paragraph 14of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
 14.       This milestone has been met. InNovember 2005, Cabinet approved PSPF's&#13;
reform proposal including the constitutional amendments that will allow PSPF to&#13;
undertake those reforms that will put the fund on a sound financial footing. Government&#13;
has indicated that it will pursue parliamentary approval o f the changes needed to the&#13;
constitution. This will allow the reform program to be implemented within a shorter&#13;
timeframe, greatly reducing the cost to the Zambian economy.&#13;
&#13;
Milestone 3: The National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) has: (a) adopted a&#13;
revised investment policy, appointed a global custodian and selected a pension fund&#13;
manager; (b) adopted an operations manual on corporategovernance; and (e) developed&#13;
aprogramfor training trustees, all in accordance withparagraph 14 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
15.        This milestonehas been substantively met. A revised investment policy that&#13;
instructs NAPSA to invest inassets externally was adopted by NAPSA's Board in2005.&#13;
This requires the appointments o f a global custodian and pension fund manager.&#13;
&#13;
16.        Although not yet final, the lengthy process o f selecting a global custodian and&#13;
NAPSA's first international asset manager is nearing completion.            A request for&#13;
proposals from global custodians is now pending before. the Tender Board o f the&#13;
Government o f Zambia.     Simultaneously, NAPSA is developing a short list o f asset&#13;
managers from an expression o f interest to which 16, mostly well-known, international&#13;
asset managers responded. Drafting a request for proposals from prospective short-listed&#13;
bidders i s also underway. The draft proposal will be submitted to the NAPSA Board o f&#13;
Directors for review and comment inJanuary. This review is essential since the Board is&#13;
responsible for development and oversight o f NAPSA investment guidelines.             The&#13;
request for proposals will be submitted to the tender board following approval o f the&#13;
Board.    It should be acknowledged that institutional reforms o f this type take time,&#13;
require consensus building and therefore their exact pace cannot be determined with full&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 certainty at the outset. However, NAPSA's management has reiterated its commitment to&#13;
 without undue delay appoint the global custodian and hndmanager in2006.&#13;
&#13;
 17.        With regard to sub milestone (b), an operational manual on corporate&#13;
 governance was prepared and adopted by NAPSA's board. The training program, sub&#13;
 milestone (c), as well as the training itself has taken place with participation not only of&#13;
NAPSA's trustees but was also attended by officials o f the Ministry of Labor, including&#13;
 the Minister, and members o f the Board o f PSPF.&#13;
&#13;
 Milestone 4: TheBorrower has madeprogress in theprocess of adopting the necessary&#13;
 revisions to the Building SocietiesAct, the National Savings and Credit Bank (NSCB)Act&#13;
 and the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ)Act, all in accordance withparagraph 19 of&#13;
 the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
 18.        This milestone has been met. The necessary changes to the legal acts of the&#13;
 above mentioned state-owned non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) with the objective&#13;
to bring each o f them under the Banking and Financial Services (BFS) Act such that all&#13;
supervisory powers are with the Bank o f Zambia (BoZ) has been adopted by Parliament.&#13;
These amendments to the Building Societies Act, the National Savings and Credit Bank&#13;
Act and the Development Bank o f Zambia Act have been signed into Law by the&#13;
President inOctober 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Milestone 5: The Borrower has commenced implementing its jkancial sector&#13;
development plan pertaining to the reform of state-owned NBFIs including NSCB, ZNBS&#13;
and DBZ, to ensure that: (a) nopublicfunds will be used with respect to NSCB, ZNBS or&#13;
DBZ without a businessplan; (b) operations restrictions on DBZ shall remain in effect&#13;
until at least 75% of its equity is committed by aprivate entity; and (c) DBZ shall not: (i)&#13;
accept deposits; and (ii) raise any loan requiring government guarantee, all in&#13;
accordance withparagraph 19of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
19.         This milestone has been met. The financial sector development plan, which&#13;
was endorsed by Cabinet inJuly 2004, identified gaps inZambia's financial sector intwo&#13;
particular crucial areas: (i)&#13;
                            provision o f investment finance and (ii) provision o f financial&#13;
services for Zambia's poor both in urban and rural areas. Inorder to fill these identified&#13;
gaps, DBZ and NSCB are to be restructured to provide the Zambian population with&#13;
these essential services.   Government has put in place an implementation framework&#13;
through a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) for each of the three state-owned&#13;
NBFIs. These MoUs were signed by the BoZ, MoFNP and management o f each o f the&#13;
three state-owned NBFIs. The MoUs designate the B o Z as the implementing agency o f&#13;
the restructuring process. Inaddition, Cabinet also reviewed the proposed changes to the&#13;
status o f the state-owned NBFIs and agreed inprinciple to the proposed transformation o f&#13;
each o fthem.&#13;
&#13;
20.         Inthe case of DBZ the agreed restrictions as spelled out inthe milestone have&#13;
been hlly adhered to and are an integral part o f its M o U with the B o 2 and the MoFNP.&#13;
The M o U between BoZ, MoFNP and NSCB management provides adequate guarantees&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 that NSCB will not engage in activities that will negatively add to its financial situation.&#13;
 In addition, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is providing&#13;
 technical assistance to improve management o f NSCB as well as project financing to&#13;
 assist the rural farming communities inZambia. The operational restrictions on ZNBS as&#13;
 specified inthe M o Uhave not ledto a recovery o f ZNBS's balance sheet&#13;
&#13;
 Milestone 6: The Borrower's Ministry of Finance and National Planning has tabled in&#13;
 the Borrower's legislature the annual budgetfor theyear 2005 including an annex which&#13;
 compares the estimated expenditures for the year 2005 with the budget releasesfor the&#13;
years 2004 and 2003, in a summary table aggregated by budget head, showing the&#13;
Personnel Emoluments (PE) and non-PE expendituresfrom the Borrower's resources all&#13;
 in accordance withparagraph 27 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
21.         This milestone has been met. Due to confusion around the interpretation o f&#13;
those articles in Zambia's constitution that stipulate which documents need to be&#13;
presented with the budget for next fiscal year to Parliament, the Ministry o f Finance and&#13;
National Planning issued the annex at the time the Medium Term Expenditure&#13;
Framework for 2006-08 was presented to Parliament, which took place in November&#13;
2005.     Note that however for the first time the 2005 budget document included a&#13;
summary table that compares the estimated expenditures for 2005 with the budget&#13;
releases for the year 2004 and the original budgeted expenditures for the year 2004 as&#13;
well as the releases for 2003 per head but not disaggregated by PE and non-PE&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Milestone 7: The Borrower's Public Sector Management Department in the Cabinet&#13;
Office has consolidated routine and current allowances into base salary and reduced the&#13;
overall ratio of allowances to base salary subject to negotiations with Public Service&#13;
Unions and the identflcation of their jiscal implications in accordance with paragraph&#13;
30 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
22.        This milestonehas been met. Zambia's civil service regulations identify over&#13;
50 allowances. In 2005, Government merged 14 general allowances into base pay for&#13;
civil servants and froze the nominal amounts for those allowances independent o f the&#13;
recipient's base pay.     This has indeed resulted in a decline o f the overall ratio o f&#13;
allowances to base salary. It should be noted that the wage negotiations in 2005 were&#13;
tense as wages had been frozen innominal terms for almost two years and that therefore&#13;
it was extremely difficult to ask for additional changes in conditions o f service, which&#13;
could have led to a firther and more substantive decline inthe ratio o f allowances to base&#13;
salary.&#13;
&#13;
23.        Government has also embarked on a comprehensive review o f its pay structures&#13;
as part o f its overall reform program in the area o f public sector management.       This&#13;
reform effort i s supported by several donors including the Bank through a Sector Wide&#13;
Approach (SWAP). IDA'Sproposed contribution to Zambia's public sector management&#13;
reform program will be presented to our Board o f Executive Directors for approval in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 7 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
January, 2006 and includes support for the proposed pay reform which deals with the&#13;
absorption o f allowances into basepay.&#13;
&#13;
Milestone 8: The Borrower's Ministry of Finance and National Planning has (a)&#13;
transferred the payroll to the Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC)&#13;
system; (b) trained users of the system in all of the Borrower's central ministries; (e)&#13;
based Personal Emoluments releases on PMEC; (d) matched each public servant to a&#13;
specijic post on the establishment; and (e) ceased to pay public servants whose post is&#13;
not on the establishment, except in relation to those identi9ed for retrenchment but not&#13;
yet paid 08all    in accordance withparagraph 30 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
24.        This milestone has been met. The transfer o f the payroll to the new PMEC&#13;
system was completed in October 2005 when the transfer o f the staff o f Ministry o f&#13;
Health was completed. The payment o f salaries and benefits o f November 2005 i s based&#13;
on the PMEC system.         Government trained all users o f the system in each central&#13;
ministry before moving their specific payroll to the new PMEC system. Inthese cases&#13;
were the transfer involved decentralized staff, the government agency responsible for the&#13;
roll out also trained staffinthe districts andprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
25.        Each civil servant which has been transferred from the old payroll system to&#13;
PEMC system has been matched to a specific post on the establishment. Approximately&#13;
five thousand civil servants out o f a total o f 115 thousand could not be matchedto a post&#13;
on the establishment. Before deciding on retrenchment o f those servants whose post i s&#13;
not on the establishment, the public service management division inthe Cabinet Office i s&#13;
evaluating the qualifications o f this group o f civil servants to see ifthey can be allocated&#13;
a post on the establishment that has remained vacant in another government agency.&#13;
Once this process has come to an end the Government i s committed to retrenching the&#13;
remainder o f this group o f civil servants in 2006 and a budgetary allocation has been&#13;
made for this exercise inthe draft budget for 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             IV.            CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
26.        Inview ofthe overallperformance andprogress withthe implementationofthe&#13;
program supported by the Credit and in compliance with the specific conditions o f&#13;
release as described in paragraphs (13-27) above the International Development&#13;
Association has informed the Borrower o f the availability o f the second tranche in the&#13;
amount o f SDR13.7 million (US$19.8 millionequivalent).&#13;
