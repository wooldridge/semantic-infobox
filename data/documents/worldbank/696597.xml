STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Loan/Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower                           For IBRD Loan: The National Bank of Egypt (NBE)&#13;
For IDA Credit: The Arab Republic of Egypt&#13;
Guarantor                   :      The Arab Republic of Egypt&#13;
Implementing Agencies       :      The Egyptian Environment Affairs Agency (EEAA)&#13;
The National Bank of Egypt (NBE)&#13;
Beneficiaries               :      EEAA, Environment Management Units in the Governorates,&#13;
local NGOs and professional associations, private and public&#13;
industrial enterprises, NBE and other participating banks&#13;
Loan/Credit Amount          :      IBRD Loan:  US$20.0 million&#13;
IDA Credit:   SDR10.3 million (US$15.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms                       :      IBRD Loan:           20 years including 5 years of grace,&#13;
standard interest rate for LIBOR-based&#13;
US dollar single currency loan&#13;
IDA Credit:         Standard for 35 years including 10 years&#13;
of grace&#13;
Commitment fee              :      For IBRD Loan:       0.75  percent on  undisbursed  loan&#13;
balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver&#13;
For IDA Credit:     0.50  percent on  undisbursed  credit&#13;
balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver&#13;
On-lending Terms            :      (i) The total amount of the IBRD loan and IDA credit would be&#13;
made available to NBE as the Apex institution on standard IBRD&#13;
and IDA terms respectively, for on-lending and awarding grants&#13;
directly or through participating banks; a guarantee fee of 0.125&#13;
percent would be payable to the Government of the Arab&#13;
Republic of Egypt (GOE); (ii) NBE would on-lend funds to&#13;
participating banks at the Bank's standard interest rate for&#13;
LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans plus 0.25 percent&#13;
per annum to cover its costs for Apex banking functions; and (iii)&#13;
Sub-loans to borrowers would be at prevailing market rates of&#13;
interest. In case sub-loans are made in Egyptian Pounds, the&#13;
NBE and participating banks would bear the foreign exchange&#13;
risk for their borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Project Objectives                The objectives of this pilot project are to strengthen the&#13;
monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental&#13;
institutions and establish technical and financial mechanisms for&#13;
pollution abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria,&#13;
and the two Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia.&#13;
Project Description        :      The Technical and Institutional Support Component  (14.2&#13;
percent of project baseline cost), which would be cofinanced by&#13;
a grant from the Government of Finland (GOF), would provide&#13;
for:&#13;
(a)  Strengthening the capacity of three EEAA branches and&#13;
four Govemorates' EMUs;&#13;
(b)  Development of Pollution Abatement Action Plans;&#13;
(c)  Support for Environmental Audit Programs; and&#13;
(d)  Promoting Awareness and Media Education Programs.&#13;
The Pollution Abatement Investment Component (80.1 percent of&#13;
project baseline cost) would provide financing for pollution&#13;
abatement sub-projects in private and public industrial enterprises.&#13;
The sub-projects would include waste minimization, pollution&#13;
prevention, resource recovery, adoption of clean technology, fuel&#13;
substitution and only as a last resort, end-of-pipe environmental&#13;
control where no other alternatives are available.&#13;
Benefits                   :      The proposed project would: (i) introduce innovative and&#13;
replicable market mechanisms for environmental management&#13;
that simultaneously develop collaboration between the financial&#13;
and regulatory/enforcement institutions and industrial enterprises;&#13;
(ii) assist the GOE in improving its monitoring/enforcement&#13;
capacity; (iii) introduce pollution prevention investments as a tool&#13;
for environmental management in Egypt; and (iv) promote the&#13;
participation of the NGOs and the media to create a public&#13;
expectation for the govemorate and the industrial enterprises to&#13;
adopt good environmental and safety practices.&#13;
Risks                      :      The project faces four significant risks: (i) If enforcement of the&#13;
environmental laws is not sufficiently strengthened, the industries&#13;
may not have a sufficient incentive to undertake abatement&#13;
measures. The technical and institutional component is designed&#13;
to support the strengthening of the institutions in charge of&#13;
enforcement; (ii) The on-lending terms and conditions may&#13;
become uncompetitive in an environment of concessionary terms&#13;
provided by the bilateral donors. This risk would be, however,&#13;
minimized by conducting periodic consultations with the bilateral&#13;
donors on the on-lending conditions and grant arrangements; (iii)&#13;
The enforcement and the financial institutions have limited&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
experience and in-house capabilities for environmental&#13;
management and environmental lending. To minimize this risk,&#13;
the technical and institutional component is mostly directed to&#13;
building up those capabilities through technical assistance and&#13;
training; and (iv) Egypt has a track record of inadequate&#13;
implementation performance. This risk would be minimized by&#13;
financing through the participating banks the priority sub-projects&#13;
already appraised, and by delegating the procurement review and&#13;
disbursement monitoring responsibilities to the Resident Mission&#13;
in Egypt.&#13;

Economic Rate of Return            :    It is difficult to estimate an ERR given the difficulty of&#13;
quantifying the environmental benefits. Based on a sample&#13;
of sub-projects appraised, accounting for 51 percent of&#13;
project cost and for which health benefits could be&#13;
quantified, the lower range of ERR varies from 18-33&#13;
percent (see Annex 10). These estimates should be treated&#13;
with caution given the uncertainties regarding the&#13;
functional relationships between health impacts and&#13;
reductions of various pollutants.&#13;

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT&#13;
POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Economic Context&#13;
1.01    At the beginning of 1991, Egypt embarked on an Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program (ERSAP). Major reforms relevant to the proposed project are: liberalization of financial&#13;
markets, mainly through the abolition of nominal ceilings on interest rates and of foreign exchange&#13;
controls; recapitalization of public banks to enhance solvency; promulgation of prudent banking&#13;
regulations; liberalization or adjustments towards market-determined levels of key prices, including energy&#13;
prices; and trade reforms and initialization of public sector restructuring and privatization. Industrial share&#13;
of GDP was 21.1 percent in 1994, while the manufacturing share was 14.7 percent. Private investment&#13;
has not responded significantly since the implementation of ERSAP and stands at about 10 percent of&#13;
GDP. Unemployment increased from an estimated 15 percent of the labor force in 1990 to 17.5 percent&#13;
in 1994. Industrial public enterprises (PEs) account for nearly 60 percent of manufacturing output.&#13;
1.02    As a result of ERSAP, 314 industrial public enterprises were removed from the control of the&#13;
sector ministries, and were organized under 17 financially autonomous holding companies reporting to a&#13;
newly established Ministry of Public Enterprise. Holding companies and their operating enterprises were&#13;
cut off from access to the Government's budget and concessionary credits. The PEs are presently in the&#13;
process of selling their non-essential assets and some are subjected by their holding company to various&#13;
degrees of restructuring. Their managers were directed to operate on a commercial basis in response to&#13;
market conditions, and encouraged through substantial performance incentives to maximize profits. As&#13;
managers are focusing on financial costs and profits, they are faced with two major interrelated&#13;
challenging constraints: unemployment and the degradation of the environment due to industrial pollution.&#13;
The most polluting sectors are the cement, chemical, fertilizer, metallurgical and pulp and paper industries.&#13;
Many of these enterprises are characterized by old and highly polluting capital stock, poor management,&#13;
deferred maintenance and inadequate health and safety of their workers. They require substantial&#13;
investments to comply with the environmental laws (para. 1.04).&#13;
1.03.    A review of the Government's policies on energy and natural resources indicate that electricity&#13;
and domestic petroleum products are now priced at about 80 percent and 90 percent of their international&#13;
level, respectively. Slow progress was made on the price of industrial water which represents about 60&#13;
percent of operation and maintenance costs in Cairo. A wastewater surcharge consisting of 50 percent&#13;
of the water charge represents about 40 percent of the operation and maintenance costs. A 20 percent&#13;
increase in water and wastewater tariffs was approved as of March 1996 for Alexandria and a similar&#13;
increase in tariff is expected for Cairo by July 1996. The adoption of an appropriate pricing policy for&#13;
energy and natural resources by the Government is fundamental for changing pollution related behavior&#13;
and for inducing the industrial enterprises to invest in pollution abatement technology.&#13;
B. Environmental Pollution and Health Impacts in Egypt&#13;
1.04    Since 1960, Egypt's rapid industrialization has resulted in indiscriminate investment and&#13;
production by both the public and private sector without emphasis on the protection of the environment&#13;
and the health of the population. Thirty-five percent of Egypt's population of 57 million (1993) lives in&#13;
the cities of Greater Cairo (consisting of the Govemorates of Cairo, Guizeh and part of Qaliubiya),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                   Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
Alexandria and the Suez Canal Cities of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez (see attached map). A severe air&#13;
and water pollution situation already exists in the two largest cities--Greater Cairo and Alexandria--which&#13;
account for over 80 percent of the industrial activity in Egypt. Serious environmental problems are also&#13;
likely to extend to the cities of Suez, Ismailia and 10th of Ramadan (50 km southeast of Cairo) where&#13;
private industrial activities are expanding rapidly. With the exception of the new cities of 10th of&#13;
Ramadan and 6th of October, industries are concentrated in highly populated areas, exposing more than&#13;
10 million people to industrial pollution and resulting in serious health risks. The Bank estimates that the&#13;
total cost of cleaning up the industrial sector in Egypt is about US$1.3 billion, or about 0.4 percent of&#13;
GDP over a ten-year period. Annex I provides a summary of the industrial pollution issues in the project&#13;
areas of Greater Cairo and Alexandria.&#13;
1.05    Greater Cairo, with a total population of 15 million and 126 PEs, is considered to be the most&#13;
polluted city in Egypt. The areas with the severest pollution are the Helwan-Tebbin industrial zone south&#13;
of Cairo and the Shubra El Kheima, Mostorod and Abuzaabal zones north of Cairo. The Helwan-Tebbin&#13;
zone includes 90 large and small industries of which the 18 major polluters are the cement, iron and steel,&#13;
coke, lead smelter, refractory, automotive and military factories. Shubra El Kheima includes 1300&#13;
medium and small scale industrial enterprises such as metal foundries, food processing, detergent and&#13;
soap manufacturing, textile, paper production and glass industries. Approximately 800 smaller scale,&#13;
privately owned industries are located throughout Cairo. These include 52 tanneries discharging toxic&#13;
substances such as chromium, and 12 lead smelters as well as many other metal smelters.&#13;
1.06    The concentration of total suspended particulates in Cairo is on average 5 to 10 times higher,&#13;
sulfur dioxide 4 times higher, smoke and lead 3 times higher and nitrogen oxides 2 times higher than&#13;
WIHO guidelines. Air pollution is severe in Helwan, resulting in ambient concentrations of dust, lead and&#13;
sulfur dioxide that are 10, 50 and 3 times higher than the WIO guidelines respectively. Untreated&#13;
industrial waters discharge into the Nile, agricultural drains and sewers, resulting in surface and&#13;
groundwater contamination with cyanide, phenol, and toxic substances such as chromium and cadmium.&#13;
1.07    A USAID-financed health-risk assessment study in Greater Cairo showed that air pollution due&#13;
to lead and dust is the most severe health risk, followed by water pollution. The study estimated that lead&#13;
pollution resulting from leaded-gasoline and lead smelters in Greater Cairo causes 6,500-11,6000 heart&#13;
attacks, 800-1,400 strokes, 6,300-11,100 cardiovascular deaths and 800-900 infant deaths per year and an&#13;
average IQ loss of 4.25 points per person. A World Bank study estimated that 15,000-17,000 premature&#13;
deaths per year are caused by excessive air particulates, sulfur dioxide and lead, predominantly emitted&#13;
from transport and industry in Greater Cairo. The National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) (para. 1.15)&#13;
reported that, in areas close to the cement plants, 29 percent of the children suffer from lung diseases&#13;
compared to 9 percent in rural areas. Toxicity caused by lead was reported among the workers of the lead&#13;
smelter belonging to the General Metal Company of Helwan. Lead content in the blood of some of the&#13;
workers was 6-8 times the WHO guidelines. Other surveys have also shown that about 20 percent of the&#13;
1I.1 million habitants of Shubra El Kheima suffer from lung diseases because of high exposures to smoke&#13;
and sulfur dioxide.&#13;
C. Legal and Institutional Framework&#13;
1.08    Legal Framework. There are many sectoral laws regulating the environment in Egypt. The&#13;
most important laws directly relevant to industrial pollution are: (i) Law 92 of 1962 regulating water&#13;
discharges to the sewage systems which gives the responsibility for implementation to the Ministry of&#13;
Housing and Public Utilities; (ii) Law 48 of 1982 protecting groundwater and all fresh surface water which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                            3&#13;
is enforced by the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) and the Ministry of Health;&#13;
and (iii) the Environment Protection Law (EPL) 4 of 1994, which provides general principles for&#13;
environmental management and protection, and is the responsibility of the Egyptian Environment Affairs&#13;
Agency (EEAA).&#13;
1.09    The Environment Protection Law expands Egypt's regulatory requirements to all areas of&#13;
environmental concern, including workers inside the plants and the general population. It is based on a&#13;
command and control (CAC) approach but mandates the provision of incentives (including economic&#13;
mechanisms) and promotes pollution prevention. It gives the polluting establishments a period of three&#13;
years (starting from the issuance of the Executing Regulations [ER] of February 1995) to comply with&#13;
most provisions, with potential additional extensions of two one-year periods; otherwise, the establishment&#13;
may be shut down. This law requires that each establishment maintain a register of its environmental&#13;
quality and emissions. It also gives every citizen and organization the right to report any violation of the&#13;
law.&#13;
1.10    An Environment Fund (EF) was established in 1986 to finance EEAA activities and operations.&#13;
Subject to public budgetary rules and management, its major source of revenues has been a 10 percent&#13;
"tourism and environment tax" imposed on the price of airline tickets, which generated in 1995 about&#13;
US$3.0 million equivalent for EEAA. The fund's sources of revenue were expanded in the EPL, to&#13;
include grants, penalties, fiscal taxes and state budgetary contributions. EEAA is presently designing, with&#13;
DANIDA assistance, a management structure and program activities for maximizing the use of this fund.&#13;
1.11    The track record of enforcement and compliance under the sectoral laws which are still in effect&#13;
has been poor. Actions have generally been taken against small operations that have little adverse&#13;
environmental impact.  It is therefore unlikely that the implementation of all legally established&#13;
requirements under the EPL could be achieved during the compliance period of 5 years. A realistic&#13;
judgement is that it may take up to 20 years for industry to comply with the EPL and its ERs.&#13;
Furthermore, the fact that EEAA is not the only enforcement agency complicates the implementation of&#13;
this law. Now that the ERs are being applied, the GOE realizes that implementation of this law is costly&#13;
and technically complex. The GOE intends, therefore, to focus first on the major polluters and polluted&#13;
industrial zones and assist them to move towards compliance, while developing a longer term program&#13;
for a comprehensive monitoring, compliance and enforcement program (MCE). The proposed project&#13;
would provide the necessary technical and institutional tools to assist the GOE in focussing on the major&#13;
polluters.&#13;
1.12    Institutional Framework. At the national level, the Environment Pr;oection Law mandated&#13;
EEAA as the national agency under the Cabinet of Ministers to be responsible for the coordination and&#13;
supervision of environmental affairs. The recently approved EEAA organizational structure includes two&#13;
operational departments of environmental management and environmental quality and a separate policy&#13;
and evaluation unit, all reporting the EEAA chief executive officer (CEO). EEAA is managed by a Board&#13;
chaired by the minister in charge of the environment, and includes EEAA's CEO, representatives of six&#13;
sector ministries, NGOs, business associations and universities. EEAA's annual budget is LE. 9.0 million&#13;
(US$2.6 million). At present, EEAA has a staff of 44 professionals who is expected to grow to 220&#13;
within the next six years.&#13;
1.13    EEAA is expected to establish eight regional branches to cover the 26 Egyptian governorates&#13;
with priority given to the branches which include industrial cities. The establishment of these branches&#13;
will be undertaken with the assistance of DANIDA and JICA (Annex 2). One of the branches' functions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                               Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
is to enforce, through environmental inspectors, the Environment Protection Law (EPL), and coordinate&#13;
enforcement in cooperation with sector ministries and governorates.  The latter should establish&#13;
environment management units (EMU) in accordance with the Local Governance Law, which regulates&#13;
the local government administration in Egypt. At present EMUs have been established in the Cairo,&#13;
Alexandria, Aswan, Fayoum, Ismailia, North Sinai, Red Sea and Suez governorates.&#13;
1.14    The environmental institutional framework suffers from: (a) a lack of effective operational&#13;
strategies; (b) redundancies and fragmentation of responsibilities between the EEAA, the sector ministries&#13;
and the governorates; (c) weak monitoring capacity at the national and local level; and (d) limited&#13;
technical, management and enforcement capabilities to address the major environmental issues of the&#13;
country. Additional technical assistance for strengthening monitoring and enforcement capabilities at the&#13;
regional and local levels would be provided under the proposed project to mitigate these constraints. Such&#13;
technical assistance would complement EEAA's institutional strengthening activities financed by the&#13;
donors (para. 1. 19).&#13;
D. Government Policy and Actions on Industrial Pollution&#13;
1.15    Since the implementation of ERSAP, the Government of Egypt (GOE) has taken concrete&#13;
actions to improve the environmental conditions and enforcing its own regulations through the preparation&#13;
of the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP), the development of a pricing and taxation policy as&#13;
well as the establishment of economic incentives. In 1992, the GOE has adopted the NEAP as the major&#13;
tool for the definition of environmental priorities and policies. The GOE is also continuing to adjust the&#13;
pricing of energy and natural resources (para. 1.03). It has also prepared a Unified Companies Law which&#13;
will apply equally to the private and public sectors. In this law which is being studied at the People&#13;
Assembly, a system of tax exemption is proposed in accordance with specific criteria. Among the criteria&#13;
for qualifying for tax exemption are the use of modern production methods and environmentally friendly&#13;
practices. In addition to the Environmental Fund (para. 1.10) and on the basis of the Environment&#13;
Protection Law which authorizes the use of economic incentives, the GOE has already begun to establish&#13;
pollution charges and fees to reduce dust emissions from cement and pollutant levels in wastewater. In&#13;
1995, an annual surcharge of LE. 5.0 (US$1.5) was imposed on the sale price of a ton of cement sold.&#13;
The cement fund has generated LE 80 million (US$23 million) in order to finance the investments to&#13;
reduce dust emissions in the cement plants. The GOE has already completed a study, financed by USAID,&#13;
for establishing strength effluent surcharges necessary to recover the costs of removing biochemical&#13;
oxygen demand (BODs) substances and total suspended solids (TSS) generated by the industrial&#13;
enterprises. The application of these surcharges are expected to be introduced in Cairo by July 1996. The&#13;
GOE is also studying the possible introduction of environmental taxes on polluting energy fuels, leaded&#13;
gasoline, agro-chemicals, hazardous substances which are being considered in the context of the replacing&#13;
tariff revenues that will be lost with the expected free trade agreement with the European Union.&#13;
1.16    All the above actions demonstrate the GOE commitment to introduce the polluter-pays principle&#13;
and provide the industrial customers with economic incentives to reduce pollution levels in their&#13;
establishments. Furthermore, the GOE has requested Bank assistance for updating the NEAP in order to&#13;
focus on investment priorities and resource mobilization. Such an update would enable the GOE to shape&#13;
a sound and coherent environmental policy based on the command and control approach and economic&#13;
incentives in order to ensure the integration of effective environmental management into Egypt's micro-&#13;
and macro-economic policies. During the mid-term review (para. 4.21), the GOE and the Bank would&#13;
assess the progress made on the above actions as well on additional economic policies and incentives for&#13;
environment protection. In the next five years, the GOE thinks that the large costs of industrial clean up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                           S&#13;
and limited resources in the PEs would impede pollution control investments for whichi medium and long&#13;
term (M&amp;LT) financing is required. At present, local financial institutions do not provide M&amp;LT loans&#13;
for purely environmental investments because of a lack of technical capacity and familiarity with&#13;
environmental lending. A financial mechanism coupled with financial incentives is therefore required to&#13;
encourage enterprises to invest in pollution control during the compliance period (para. 1.09). Discussions&#13;
between the GOE senior officials and the Bank re-affirmed the GOE commitment to establish such a&#13;
mechanism through the proposed project, so that polluting enterprises would not be able to plead lack of&#13;
information, resources or incentives as an excuse for not curtailing pollution.&#13;
1.17    In order to promote the Environment Protection Law during the compliance period, the GOE,&#13;
acting through EEAA, would adopt under this project a three-tiered National Pollution Abatement Action&#13;
Plan (NPAAP):&#13;
(a) At the national level, EEAA, in coordination with relevant ministries, would define the&#13;
scope and priorities for pollution abatement on the basis of the NEAP.&#13;
(b) At the local level, each governorate would establish a Governorate Industrial Pollution&#13;
Abatement Plan (GIPAP) in collaboration with the industrial enterprises, as part of a&#13;
Governorate Environmental Action Plan for which bilateral donors' assistance is being&#13;
provided. The Governorate's plan would be used as the basis to evaluate and implement&#13;
process modernization and waste minimization according to a priority list established by the&#13;
governorate authorities in collaboration with EEAA.&#13;
(c) At the industrial enterprise level, each individual plant selected from the priority list of the&#13;
major industrial polluters [para. 2.04 (b)] would be asked by the governorate to develop a&#13;
Pollution Abatement Action Plan (PAAP) consistent with the GIPAP. The PAAP, using&#13;
the integrated pollution control approach, would describe appropriate actions to comply with&#13;
the environmental standards, the schedule for implementation, amount and type of pollutants&#13;
that would be reduced, the required investment costs, the employment implications, the&#13;
monitoring that must be performed by the company, and other conditions that the&#13;
Governorate office and EEAA feel are necessary.&#13;
1.18    Each PAAP prepared by an enterprise would be formalized by an executive order issued by the&#13;
Governor in accordance with the Local Governance law. Implementation of the PAAP's mitigating plan&#13;
will be monitored by the EMU with support form the EEAA's regional branches. In case of lack of&#13;
progress, the Governor could suspend or revoke the operating license of the enterprise. The Local&#13;
Governance Law permits such suspension in order to preserve safety and health conditions of the workers&#13;
and the population. Furthermore, EEAA would provide assistance to selected NGOs [para. 2.04(d)] under&#13;
this project, in order to follow up on the progress of the PAAP and ensure ownership by the local&#13;
community potentially affected by the polluting enterprises. The proposed project would also provide&#13;
management and technical assistance to prepare pollution abatement action plans at the governorate and&#13;
plant levels.&#13;
E. Donor Support for Environmental Management and Industrial Pollution&#13;
1.19    The proposed project has been designed to complement the environmental management and&#13;
industrial pollution control activities programmed by 13 international donors during the period 1994-1996&#13;
for a total of about US$164.8 million (details in Annex 2). Activities financed by CIDA, DANIDA, EIB,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                 Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
FES, Italy, JICA, METAP, GOF, GTZ/KfW, ODA, Switzerland, UNDP, and USAID were based on the&#13;
NEAP and included: (a) strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of EEAA, the sector&#13;
ministries and governorates (US$20.5 million); (b) establishing a national water and air quality monitoring&#13;
network and environment information system (US$12.7 million); (c) supporting local NGOs and&#13;
environment businesses by the private sector (US$15.4 million); (d) conducting environmental audits in&#13;
key industrial sectors (US$11.0 million); and (e) financing demonstration projects and pollution control&#13;
investments in specific plants (US$105.2 million). During project preparation, several bilateral and&#13;
international donors were consulted to avoid duplication of efforts, to ensure that the projects will be&#13;
mutually supportive, and to take advantage of the results of the studies and activities currently in place.&#13;
As a result of these consultations, the Government of Finland agreed to provide a direct financing grant&#13;
of FIM 26.0 million (US$5.7 million equivalent) to cofinance the technical and institutional support&#13;
component of the project (para. 2.04). The European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering providing an&#13;
additional loan of up to ECU 15.0 million (US$19.5 million) for the pollution abatement investmnent&#13;
component of the project (para. 2.13).&#13;
1.20    Of particular relevance to the proposed project are two ongoing projects financed by KfW. The&#13;
first one is the Program Support to the Private Sector Industry and its Environment Protection (DM 64&#13;
million, or US$46.0 million). This project provides, through three local joint-venture banks, loans for&#13;
plant rehabilitation and expansion. The loan maturities to the private sector enterprises are for 5-8 years&#13;
with one year of grace at an interest rate near the lower end of the market rate. The environmental&#13;
investments as components of the private sector rehabilitation program, are eligible for grants up to 50&#13;
percent of these costs. This project has just started and eight sub-projects are about to be financed.&#13;
1.21    The second project under preparation with KfW  is the Facility for Financing Environmental&#13;
Protection in the Public Sector. This facility would finance 15-20 industrial wastewater treatment projects&#13;
for PEs and the utilities of the Egyptian Electricity Authority. It would include a credit component to be&#13;
provided by participating banks and enterprises and a grant component of DM 50 million (US$35.5&#13;
million) which could provide up to 50% of the investment costs for end-of-pipe treatment and 20-25&#13;
percent for process modernization. The credit component could provide a loan for 30-35 percent of the&#13;
investment cost, with 3-5 year maturity, one year of grace, and interest set at the lower end of the market&#13;
range. The public sector entity is expected to raise 15-20 percent of the investment cost from its own&#13;
resources, though the participating banks could waive this requirement.&#13;
1.22    During project preparation, the Bank and KfW  have regularly exchanged information and&#13;
coordinated the design of their respective projects with EEAA as well as the proposed lending&#13;
arrangements. KfW's second project and the Bank's proposed project have similar features. Both would:&#13;
(a) assist industry to comply with the EPL; (b) channel funds through the local commercial banks; and&#13;
(c) use grants as incentives for environmental investments. The projects are mutually supportive. KfW&#13;
project focuses on industrial wastewater and targets 5 percent of the industrial public sector; the Bank&#13;
project would finance environmental investments in public and private sector industrial enterprises, using&#13;
the technical and institutional support component to facilitate compliance and enforcement of the&#13;
environmental laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                            7&#13;
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.23    The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Egypt discussed at the Board on March 24,&#13;
1994 has four major thrusts: (a) economic reform; (b) public enterprise reform and private sector&#13;
development; (c) development of human resources, poverty alleviation, and improvement of safety net;&#13;
and (d) improving natural resource management and the environment. The Bank's Egypt Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy Note on Environment (February 1995) as well as Egypt's National Environment&#13;
Action Plan (May 1992) identify industrial pollution, institutional capacity building and management of&#13;
natural resources as the three major environmental priorities in Egypt. The Bank has prepared in draft&#13;
a Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook which focuses on promoting new pnd cost effective&#13;
approaches based on integrated pollution prevention for managing industrial pollution issues.  The&#13;
proposed project would respond to both the GOE's and the Bank's objectives to improve the environment,&#13;
reduce damage to human health, support effective environmental management at the national and local&#13;
levels, and test in the field the Bank's new approaches to industrial pollution control in Egypt. If&#13;
successful, the project could transfer experience to other private and public industrial programs in other&#13;
countries in the Middle East and North Africa.&#13;
1.24    The proposed project is also consistent with the Bank's Private Sector Development (PSD)&#13;
assistance strategy. The Bank's strategy is to support reforms in the policy, regulatory and incentives&#13;
fiamework and market-based interventions to promote responsible environmental behavior by the business&#13;
sector. Under the proposed project, the Bank would play a major role in helping the GOE introduce an&#13;
innovative and replicable process for addressing industrial pollution, as well as mobilizing and enhancing&#13;
the effectiveness of other donors' resources earmarked for environmental protection. IFC is currently&#13;
designing a Mediterranean Environment Fund to be capitalized at US$50.0 million for financing&#13;
environmental investments in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, West Bank and Gaza. Such&#13;
Fund would alleviate the shortage of financing necessary to address among its project components, the&#13;
environmental requirements of polluted enterprises. The proposed project would complement this&#13;
innovative IFC initiative.&#13;
G. Lessons Learned from Previous Industrial Pollution Control Operations&#13;
1.25    The main lesson emerging from the Bank's enviromnental project experience is that broad-based&#13;
policies supported by strong institutions should be in place if pollution abatement projects are to be&#13;
successful. These policies include: (a) use of an integrated pollution control approach with a combination&#13;
of command-and-control (CAC) and market-based incentives; (b) strong institutional capabilities in&#13;
monitoring and enforcement; (c) public participation; and (d) Government commitment and ownership.&#13;
In recent Bank operations, support for such policies was supplemented with financial mechanisms in the&#13;
form of credit lines. The latter were established through domestic banks (India, Brazil and China) or&#13;
through a separate national Pollution Abatement Facility (Russia) for on-lending to polluting enterprises&#13;
on a long term maturity of 7-10 years with a 2-3 year grace period. Grants and concessionary loans were&#13;
used in industrial pollution control projects for common treatment facilities (India), demonstration projects&#13;
(India), and sanitary landfills (China). The project will strengthen the above policy elements in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;

8                                                                Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Design Alternatives&#13;
2.01    Three alternatives were considered for project design: (a) a technical assistance project which&#13;
would put in place effective environmental monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to induce demand&#13;
for environmental investments; (b) an investment project which would reduce exposure to hazardous&#13;
pollution in a particular geographical area (such as Helwan) or in a heavily polluting industrial sector&#13;
(chemicals and/or metallurgy); and (c) a pilot project which would establish a monitoring and enforcement&#13;
mechanism, introduce integrated pollution prevention as a tool, and put in place, on a pilot scale, a&#13;
financial mechanism for industrial pollution control. The first and second alternatives were not selected&#13;
because of the availability of grant funds for technical assistance (see para. 1.19) and the unavailability&#13;
of large capital funds to mitigate the numerous pollution problems in the most polluting industrial sectors.&#13;
The third alternative was specifically requested by the GOE as it would promote cost effective and&#13;
voluntary pollution prevention and abatement during the compliance period and establish a pollution&#13;
abatement fund in the local banks to finance a limited number of pollution abatement sub-projects, while&#13;
the environmental regulatory and enforcement capacity is being developed.  This pilot project will&#13;
therefore not attempt to resolve the industrial pollution issues of the country; rather it will initiate the&#13;
process of strengthening the Government's institutional capacities in monitoring and enforcement and&#13;
simultaneously develop collaboration between the industrial enterprises, the financial sector and the&#13;
regulatory and enforcement institutions through financing a limited number of environmental investments.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.02    The project's broad objective is to assist the GOE in reducing industrial pollution causing&#13;
adverse health effects and/or ecological degradation.  Its specific objectives are to strengthen the&#13;
monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental institutions and establish technical and&#13;
financial mechanisms for supporting pollution abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and&#13;
the Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
2.03    The project would consist of two main components: (a) a technical and institutional support&#13;
component and (b) an investment component.&#13;
2.04    Technical and Institutional Support Component (Base cost = US$6.9 million). This&#13;
component would provide technical assistance, studies, training, monitoring equipment and field vehicles&#13;
to support the following four sub-components. The GOF agreed to parallel cofinance this component with&#13;
a grant to the GOE of FIM 26.0 million (US$5.7 million equivalent). However, because this component&#13;
is directly related to the activities of the second component, agreement was reached during negotiations&#13;
with the GOF and the GOE. that the Bank would iointly monitor and supervise this component. A detailed&#13;
description of this component and the services required is included the Project Implementation Plan (PIP)&#13;
which was reviewed during negotiations.&#13;
(a) Strengthening the capacity of the EEAA branches and Governorates' Environment&#13;
Management Units (EMUs). This sub-component would strengthen the technical and&#13;
administrative capacity of the three regional branches of EEAA and the four EMUs in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                                9&#13;
governorates of Alexandria, Cairo, Qaliubiya and Suez to prepare, follow up and enforce&#13;
the governorates' and the enterprises' pollution abatement action plans. Assistance would&#13;
also be provided to EEAA to revise the discharge and emission standards in terms of&#13;
pollution loads.&#13;
(b) Development of Pollution Abatement Action Plans (PAAPs). This sub-component would&#13;
help finance the preparation of PAAPs for about 40 major polluters in Egypt. These&#13;
industrial polluters, of which a list is provided in the PIP, were identified on the basis of&#13;
environmental criteria developed during project preparation. Individual enterprises which&#13;
prepare PAAPs would be eligible to access the Pollution Abatement Fund (PAF) to be&#13;
established under the second component of this project (para. 2.05). During negotiations.&#13;
assurances were obtained from EEAA on a yearly submission to the Bank of the list of&#13;
enterprises which would prepare a PAAP.&#13;
(c) Support for Environmental Audit Programs. This sub-component would help conduct&#13;
in-plant environmental audits to identify pollution abatement opportunities in the industrial&#13;
zones of Greater Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez Canal cities of Ismailia and Suez, estimate&#13;
their costs and benefits, and prepare requests of financially viable enterprises to access the&#13;
PAF. This sub-component would include inter-alia: (i) services from environment experts&#13;
accredited by EEAA to review and/or conduct environmental audits at the request of the&#13;
individual enterprises; (ii) training services in environmental auditing and financing for&#13;
qualified personnel from sector ministries, industrial and banking organizations, enterprises,&#13;
and consulting firms; (iii) "on-the-job" training and training-for-trainers programs as well&#13;
as the development of appropriate guidelines for participating Egyptian banks on selecting&#13;
and evaluating environmental loans; (iv) technical assistance and training of plant managers&#13;
for protecting workers' health and safety; and v) establishing a database on the relative cost&#13;
effectiveness of various types of prevention and abatement sub-projects.&#13;
(d) Promoting Awareness and Media Education Programs. This sub-component would&#13;
support the participation of the local communities and the media in the preparation,&#13;
monitoring and follow up on the GIPAP and the PAAPs of the major industrial polluters&#13;
(para. b). It would strengthen the technical and administrative capacity of two local NGOs--&#13;
the Association for Enterprises for Environment Conservation and Friends of the&#13;
Environment Association in Alexandria--as well as of two professional associations--the&#13;
Society of Writers on Environment and Development and the Management Engineering&#13;
Society. These NGOs and professional associations were selected on the basis of criteria&#13;
developed by EEAA and reviewed by the Bank. The sub-component would support free&#13;
lance environmental writing in the local press on the opportunities offered to industry for&#13;
pollution prevention and control and would also increase knowledge on clean technologies&#13;
and pollution prevention among professionals in the environmental field.  This sub-&#13;
component would include: (i) development of methodologies and training materials for&#13;
evaluating the results of industrial pollution control; (ii) organization of specialized seminars&#13;
and workshops to disseminate information on the PAAPs; and (iii) introduction of&#13;
information on new technologies and practices to professional associations and interest&#13;
groups who are involved in environmental activities in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
2.05    The Pollution Abatement Investment Component (Base cost = US$39.0 million). This&#13;
component would consist of a Pollution Abatement Fund estimated at US$35.0 million and the enterprises'&#13;
investment contribution of US$4.0 million equivalent. The Pollution Abatement Fund (PAF) would be&#13;
established to provide financing for environmental investment sub-projects in about 25 public and private&#13;
enterprises to bring their effluent discharges and/or air emissions towards compliance with the&#13;
Environment Protection Law in a cost effective manner. The PAF would provide, on a first come-first&#13;
serve basis, sub-loans and grants through selected local participating banks (para. 2.17). The sub-projects&#13;
would include waste minimization, pollution prevention, resource recovery, adoption of clean technology,&#13;
fuel substitution and end-of-pipe environmental control where no other alternatives are available.&#13;
However, the sub-project would be screened through the identification of the largest contributors to&#13;
environmental damage as defined in the NEAP and in the environmental strategy priorities which are&#13;
being prepared by EEAA. It would comprise: (a) a Credit Facility (para. 2.16) to provide sub-loans with&#13;
an expected maturity of 5-8 years with 1-2 year grace period, at market interest rates; and (b) a Grant&#13;
Facility (para. 2.18) to provide limited, one-time, transparent cost sharing of pollution abatement&#13;
investments. A flat rate grant of 20 percent of the investment cost will be provided to sub-projects with&#13;
a simple pay-back period of more than two years (para. 2.19).&#13;
2.06    A pipeline of sub-projects from 18 enterprises was audited, of which 12 priority enterprises (8&#13;
in the public sector and 4 in the private sector) were selected from an industrial pollution point of view&#13;
on the basis of the sub-project eligibility criteria provided in para. 2.14. Seven of the PEs are on the list&#13;
of the worst industrial polluters [para. 2.04(b)]. Sub-projects in these enterprises would constitute the&#13;
priority sub-projects which could be financed by the PAF as soon as it becomes operational. The sub-&#13;
projects cover the chemical, metallurgical, textile, paper and metallic sectors for a total amount of&#13;
US$36.4 million (exclusive of taxes and duties). Annex 3 summarizes the priority investment sub-projects&#13;
and their estimated costs. Sub-projects covering the cement sector would not be considered since the GOE&#13;
has already contracted with local international expertise to reduce dust emissions (para. 1.26).&#13;
2.07    The PAF is intended to support financially-viable private and public enterprises which would&#13;
bear the costs of clean-up. The PAF would not finance new industrial plants and/or capacity expansions.&#13;
This is because new plants should conform with the executive regulations and are not allowed a grace&#13;
period under the EPL.&#13;
2.08     In the case of enterprises that are currently making losses, the holding companies are&#13;
restructuring them by selling off non-essential assets, cutting costs and carrying out financial restructuring.&#13;
If these enterprises cannot be returned to profitability, they will be closed. However, in a few cases,&#13;
where closure is not possible today because of political concerns over social disruption and because of&#13;
legal inhibitions on labor shedding, it may be necessary for the holding companies to cross-subsidize non-&#13;
viable enterprises, pending resolution of the political issues. Environmental investments in these non-&#13;
viable enterprises may be justified if the payback period in terms of environmental benefits (and,&#13;
additionally, in some cases financial benefits) is shorter than the expected enterprise life before potential&#13;
close-down, or if the holding company expects the enterprise life to be longer than the compliance grace&#13;
period stipulated in the Environment Protection Law. In this case, the holding company may be willing&#13;
to bear the cost of environmental investment which would be limited to those sections of the enterprises&#13;
whose pollution is affecting public health, and apply for financing from the PAF provided that such an&#13;
arrangement is acceptable to the participating bank. If, however, the holding company perceives a high&#13;
probability of a close-down before the end of the compliance period, it would rather delay environmental&#13;
investments and not apply for financing from the PAF. This minimizes the risk of PAF financing for&#13;
investments in enterprises likely to be closed down in the near future.&#13;

D. Project Costs&#13;
2.09        The estimated project cost is LE. 191.7 million, or US$48.7 million.  The foreign exchange&#13;
component of LE 156.4 million, or US$48.7 million, represents 83.9 percent of total costs. These&#13;
estimates are based on December 1995 prices and exclude taxes and duties. Price and cost contingencies&#13;
were estimated on the first project component only since the second project component is a credit line&#13;
with a fixed dollar amount. A 10 percent contingency was estimated on the equipment cost of the first&#13;
project component and price contingencies have been based on a 7 percent increase annually for local&#13;
costs and 2 percent annually for foreign costs. Detailed cost estimates of the first project component and&#13;
the incremental operating costs are provided  in Annex 4.   The estimated cost by component and sub-&#13;
component is summarized in Table 2.1.&#13;

E. Project Financing Plan&#13;
2.10    The overall financing of the proposed project is presented in Table 2.2. The Bank financing&#13;
of the project would consist of an IBRD single currency loan of US$20.0 million and an IDA credit of&#13;
US$15.0 million equivalent.  By signing the&#13;
IBRD single currency agreen.ent, Egypt qualifies&#13;
for the  Bank  single  currency  loan. The               Table 2.2: Project Financing Plan&#13;
Government of Finland agreed to provide a grant                 US$ Million&#13;
to the GOE in the amount of FIM 26.0 million&#13;
(US$5.7 million) in order to parallel cofinance                                   Percent of&#13;
the first project component. During negotiations    Source  Local   Forei,n   Tonal  Total&#13;
agreement was reached with the GOE that the    GOE        40      ---       4.0     8.2&#13;
GOF grant agreement would be signed before    Enterprises  4.0    -----     4.0     8.2&#13;
January 15, 1997. The GOF grant agreement    GOF          ----     5.7      5.7    11.7&#13;
IBRD      ----    20.      20.0    41.1&#13;
signature would not delay project implementation    IDA   ----    20       15.0    30.8&#13;
or disbursement.&#13;
2.11    The Technical and Institutional Support   Total   8.0    40.7      48.7   100.0&#13;
Component (para. 2.04), estimated at US$7.8&#13;
million, would be financed from the GOF grant of US$5.7 million equivalent and the GOE contribution&#13;
of US$2.1 million equivalent. The PAF (para. 2.05) estimated at US$35.0 million would consist of: A&#13;
Credit Facility of US$28.0 million and a Grant Facility of US$7.0 million. The enterprises' own&#13;
contribution is estimated at US$4.0 million equivalent and the incremental operating costs are estimated&#13;
at US$1.9 million equivalent.&#13;
2.12    The IBRD loan and II)A credit would finance approximately 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
exchange cost of the sub-projects' investments. The enterprises would cover their own local costs&#13;
including civil works and these costs were estimated at US$ 4.0 million exclusive of taxes and duties&#13;
(estimated at about US$3.6 million equivalent). The GOF grant of US$5.7 million equivalent would cover&#13;
the foreign exchange cost of the Technical and Institutional Support Component as agreed in the GOF&#13;
grant agreement. The GOE would finance the local cost of the first component as well as 100 percent of&#13;
the incremental operating costs. Table 2.2 provides a detailed breakdown of the financing scheme.&#13;
2.13    In addition to the GOF grant, the GOE is also trying to mobilize additional resources to expand&#13;
the pollution abatement investments component by financing additional sub-projects (para. 2.05). The&#13;
European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering providing a loan in an amount of up to ECU 15.0 million&#13;
(US$19.5 million equivalent) to finance additional sub-projects, with priority given to water and&#13;
wastewater pollution. The EIB loan for the environment has a duration of 12-15 years, including a grace&#13;
period of 3-5 years and a fixed interest rate at three percentage points below EIB's normal lending rate.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Bank would proceed with the processing of the&#13;
proiect in accordance with the established time schedule. Once EIB cofinancing is finalized with the GOE.&#13;
the Bank would take the necessary measures in agreement with NBE and the GOE. to ensure that such&#13;
cofinancing is allocated to the proiect on the basis of the negotiated cofinancing arrangements. It is&#13;
expected that EIB would submit their project for Board approval in June/July 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                              13&#13;
F. Sub-Project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
2.14    Enterprises seeking financing should meet the following eligibility criteria. First the enterprise:&#13;
(a) should be credit-worthy to the participating bank; (b) should be a source of potential health problems&#13;
and/or adverse environmental impact: priority will be given to (i) air emissions of heavy metals,&#13;
carcinogenic organic substances, dust and sulfur dioxide; and/or (ii) water discharges of heavy metals,&#13;
organic substances L.,( acids; and (c) be ready to undertake or already have undertaken an environmental&#13;
audit. Second, to the extent practical, pollution control techniques in a given sub-project should be&#13;
replicable by other firms. Third, the enterprise should be committed to developing a pollution abatement&#13;
action plan. Fourth, plant managers should be willing to take the necessary measures for protecting&#13;
workers' health and safety, perform self monitoring, evaluate the technical performance of the investments&#13;
and the environmental benefits, and allow EEAA to publish the findings. Finally, for any single&#13;
enterprise, any sub-loan or a combination of sub-loans would not exceed US$5.0 million in order to allow&#13;
financing of several sub-projects in different sectors. However, for sources situated in densely populated&#13;
areas and which emit large amounts of toxic substances or heavy metals, the Project Steering Committee&#13;
(para. 4.01) could increase the sub-loans to an enterprise to US$8.0 million, after agreement with the&#13;
Bank. An economic analysis for each sub-project above US$5.0 million ceiling would be a pre-requisite&#13;
for the Bank approval. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the GOE on the adoption of&#13;
the above eligibility criteria for sub-proiect appraisal.&#13;
G. Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.15    Borrower. The National Bank of Egypt (NBE) (see paras. 3.03-3.10) would be the borrower&#13;
of the IBRD loan and the GOE the guarantor of this loan and the borrower of the IDA credit. NBE would&#13;
enter into a project agreement with the IDA. The IDA credit would be on-lent to NBE at 0.875 percent&#13;
(0.75 percent plus 0.125 percent for a guarantee/commitment fee) for up to 35 year maturity. NBE would&#13;
allocate 80 percent of total IBRD and IDA financing for the Credit Facility and 20 percent for the Grant&#13;
Facility.&#13;
2.16    Credit Facility. NBE would be responsible for on lending directly to enterprises and would&#13;
provide funds to participating banks for on-lending to industrial enterprises at market rates. Loan&#13;
maturities are expected to be 5-8 years with a 1-2 year grace period. Participating banks would be&#13;
provided funds in US dollars through NBE at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar&#13;
single currency loans plus, 0.25 percentage points per annum to cover its Apex banking functions.&#13;
Participating banks, including NBE, would on-lend to enterprises in US$ or LE, and the participating bank&#13;
would assume the foreign exchange risk if on-lending is in LE. The lending rates to enterprises, whether&#13;
US$ or LE denominated sub-loans, would be at the participating banks' own discretion. The participating&#13;
banks will bear the commercial risk.&#13;
2.17    Participating banks have been screened on the basis of their market share of commercial lending,&#13;
and (b) financial performance and solvency. Four local banks, in addition to NBE, have tentatively been&#13;
selected to participate in this project. They consist of the private joint-venture banks: Commercial&#13;
Intemational Bank (CIB), Misr International Bank (MIBank), Egyptian American Bank (EAB), and Cairo&#13;
Barclays Bank (CBB). Their final selection was confirmed during negotiations. All these banks have&#13;
experience in managing credit lines for bilateral and international donors and financial institutions such&#13;
as USAID, EIB, KfW and the European Union (EU). The CIB, MIB and EAB are the largest joint&#13;
venture banks in Egypt, and all rank among the most profitable and solvent. Annex 5 provides a short&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                               Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
description of CBB, CIB, EAB and MIB. The CBB was also tentatively selected based on its expressed&#13;
interest in the project, involvement in the industrial sector, and financial performance and solvency.&#13;
2.18    Grant Facility.  A grant would be provided to industrial enterprises as part of a loan/grant&#13;
package (para. 2.05). The NBE would be allowed a 0.5 percent processing charge of the grant amount.&#13;
Several options for grant eligibility have been considered and are summarized in Annex 6. Since&#13;
95 percent of the sub-projects in the pipeline have an expected simple payback of more than two years,&#13;
the PAF would finance only those investments with a payback period of more than two years and will&#13;
provide a flat grant of 20 percent. This grant portion corresponds to the pre- and post-investment costs,&#13;
such as engineering studies, commissioning, training and self monitoring.&#13;
2.19    A grant element, taken as a percentage of the investment cost, would be included as a temporary&#13;
feature of pollution abatement financing during the compliance period allowed in the Environment&#13;
Protection Law. The rationale for the grant element is the failure of the market to internalize the social&#13;
cost of pollution. Specifically, the grant would: (a) provide an incentive for pollution abatement during&#13;
the compliance period, in recognition of the substantial social costs of current environmental pollution;&#13;
(b) demonstrate least-cost opportunities for pollution abatement which would have external benefits in&#13;
terms of information and lessons for the industrial sector as a whole; and (c) reduce resistance to&#13;
enforcement of the EPL. The grant would be normally paid in two tranches; the first tranche would be&#13;
paid upon signing the sub-loan with the participating bank and the second tranche would be released after&#13;
the Project Implementation Unit (para. 4.02) would certify that the equipment is installed. The grant&#13;
would be converted to a loan, and repaid to the grant facility, if the grant is used for purposes other than&#13;
those specified and decided upon in the sub-project agreement, in every case when the minimum figures&#13;
of the measurable environmental indicators are not met. Such sub-project agreements would be signed&#13;
between the PIU and the individual enterprise and attached as an annex to the sub-loan/grant agreement&#13;
(para. 4.05).&#13;
III. THE APEX INSTITUTION&#13;
A. The Banking Environment&#13;
3.01    The new banking legislation of 1992/1993 increased the power of the Central Bank of Egypt&#13;
(CBE) in regulating and supervising banks, and imposed more stringent financial and capital solvency on&#13;
banks operating in Egypt. Prudential regulations in line with international practices have been introduced,&#13;
such as those regarding risk-based capital adequacy ratios and loan classification. Additional funds have&#13;
been infused for recapitalization of the four public commercial banks to bring their capital adequacy ratio&#13;
to the minimum of 8 percent. Those banks that fail to meet the minimum requirement can face liquidation&#13;
or forced merger with other banks.&#13;
3.02    Bank legislation in Egypt discourages disclosure of data and information on the financial&#13;
conditions of banks, beyond what is included in published annual reports and accounts. This strongly&#13;
limits independent external audits of banks to assess financial performance and solvency. However, banks&#13;
are required to submit financial statistics to the CBE on a monthly basis, and CBE makes on-site&#13;
verifications on a regular basis to assess compliance with bank regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                                   15&#13;
B. The National Bank of Egypt (NBE)&#13;
3.03     Background. NBE is a public and the largest commercial bank in Egypt in terms of total&#13;
assets. NBE has the largest branch network in the country reaching 316 branches covering an extensive&#13;
geographic area. This enables NBE to build a strong retail banking operations that offers a number of&#13;
saving schemes at competitive rates allowing it to build a high level of deposits. NBE has a strong&#13;
presence in money markets and in the areas of trade and project finance. It acts as the lead bank to the&#13;
Egyptian petroleum sector and handles all petroleum sale proceeds and their investments. As the GOE&#13;
will only extend a guarantee for a public sector bank, NBE has been selected to be the Apex institution&#13;
for the PAF. Annex 5 provides the NBE financial summary.&#13;
3.04     The bank is managed by an 8-member Board of Directors appointed by the Ministry of the&#13;
Economy, but management is free to determine the bank's policy and funding strategy and directs the&#13;
bank's operations. Management is autonomous and dynamic. Major emphasis is placed on the bank's&#13;
audit and control departments. The NBE credit department, which will manage the credit and grant&#13;
facilities, has the responsibility of approving the various types of loans. Its loan approval and monitoring&#13;
procedures are well developed. A client credit analysis is prepared for loan approval. The client's&#13;
financial position is analyzed from balance&#13;
sheets and income statements over the last&#13;
three years, and a projected cash flow  is    Table 3.1: Distribution of NBE Loans (1995)&#13;
prepared to assess debt servicing and&#13;
repayment capacity; and the client must&#13;
provide a guarantee in the form of physical                          LE (Million)   (% of total)&#13;
assets and/or cash deposits. NBE has been     Agriculture                285           1.3&#13;
accounting for its past problem loans and is&#13;
fuilly provisioned, as per CBE directives, on  Industry                6,626          30.2&#13;
its non-performing  loan portfolio.  The      Tad                      3,141          14.3&#13;
financial analysis provided below is based     rde&#13;
on the NBE audit reports till June 30, 1994   Services                 4,889          22.3&#13;
which was reviewed by the Bank during                                                 31.9&#13;
pre-appraisal. Reference is also made to the&#13;
unaudited report for FY 95.&#13;
3.05     Financial Performance. As of June 30, 1995, NBE's total assets and deposits reached LE 47.3&#13;
billion (US$13.9 billion equivalent) and LE 35.3 billion (US$10.4 billion equivalent), representing 25&#13;
percent and 26 percent, respectively, of total assets and deposits in the commercial banks. In 1994, the&#13;
assets and deposits were lower, reaching LE 42.5 billion (US$12.5 billion equivalent) and LE 32.7 billion&#13;
(US$9.6 billion equivalent) respectively.&#13;
3.06     Portfolio. NBE total loan portfolio of LE 21.9 billion (US$6.44 billion equivalent) till 6/30/95&#13;
increased from 18.7 billion (US$5.5 billion equivalent). The loan portfolio in FY94 was diversified in&#13;
the industrial, trade, and service sectors (Table 3.1). Public sector and Government loans comprised 55.3&#13;
percent of the total loan portfolio in 1995, down from 65% in FY91. Private business sector loans&#13;
increased from 20.8 percent in 1991 to 30.5 percent in FY95.&#13;
3.07     Liquidity. The structure of deposits changed significantly from FY91 to FY94 in favor of&#13;
longer term deposits (Table 3.2). The net loans to total deposits were squeezed to 53 percent in FY95&#13;
as opposed to 49 percent and 44 percent in FY94 and FY93 respectively. This is a direct result of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                            Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
increase in loans coupled with a slight decrease in deposits. The deterioration of the liquidity level is&#13;
reflected in the liquid asset ratio which reached 45 percent in FY95 and 48 percent in FY94. This is&#13;
mainly due to the transfer of interbank deposits to the NBE's subsidiary which reduced the balance of&#13;
due from banks. The bank enjoys a&#13;
strong   customer   deposit   base&#13;
increasing  by  almost 8 percent in&#13;
FY95 while dropping slightly by 3.8                     Table 3.2: NBE DePOS;tS by Type 1LE Million)&#13;

resulting in a marginal cost of funds&#13;
of about 11.5-12 percent if the non-&#13;
interest bearing Central Bank reserve requirement of 15 percent of deposits is included. Lending rates in&#13;
US dollars were normally 1-2 percentage points above LIBOR. Six months US dollar time deposit rates&#13;
were in the range of 4.5-5.5 percent depending on amount and bank. NBE offered rates that were slightly&#13;
above major private bank competitors for LE time deposits, but lower for US dollar time deposits.&#13;
3.09      Profitability.  The NBE profitability has been consistent but low (Table 3.3). The return on&#13;
average assets (ROAA) has consistently been positive in the 1990s and has been 0.22 percent in 1995&#13;
slightly higher that 0.19 percent in FY94. The relatively low profitability can in part, be explained by&#13;
higher annual provisions but also higher operating costs These provisions have been sufficient to keep&#13;
capital, reserves and provisions to more than 25 percent of total loans, which is equivalent to more than&#13;
40 percent of all NBE loans to the public&#13;
sector or almost 80 percent of all loans to&#13;
public and  private industry.   In order to&#13;

3.11    NBE is currently implementing a restructuring plan to reduce its operating cost, improve its&#13;
customer services in order to compete for deposits, and improve profitability. IFC is considering a Risk&#13;
Management Facility for up to US$ 10 million loan equivalent of exposure to offer its private sector&#13;
clientele the ability to hedge interest rate and currency risks.&#13;
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Project Implementation&#13;
4.01    Overall coordination of the project would be entrusted to a Steering Committee (SC) consisting&#13;
of EEAA chief executive officer (CEO), senior officials of sector ministries, and representatives of the&#13;
participating NGOs and banks, the Federation of Egyptian Industries and the Egyptian Businessmen&#13;
Association. Private sector participation in the SC would ensure that the PAF is accessible to private and&#13;
public industries on an equal basis. This Committee would provide overall policy guidance, review work&#13;
programs, resolve any inter-ministerial implementation issues, recommend to the participating banks any&#13;
sub-project above US$2.0 million and review semi-annually the status of sub-project selection and&#13;
implementation. During appraisal, the GOE established the steering committee and nominated its members&#13;
by ministerial decree.&#13;
4.02     A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with qualified staff, was also established by the same&#13;
ministerial decree as the SC. It would manage the first component of the project (para. 2.04) and be the&#13;
main interface with the participating banks. The PIU would consist of a full time project manager, and&#13;
four specialists in procurement, finance, industrial pollution and training.  In relation to the second&#13;
component of the project (para. 2.05), the PIU's responsibilities would include: (a) technically evaluating&#13;
and monitoring implementation of the financed sub-projects; (b) approving and recommending to the&#13;
participating banks any sub-project below US$2.0 million and would review /recommend to the SC for&#13;
approval any sub-project above US$2.0 million; (c) ensuring that all procurement is in compliance with&#13;
Bank guidelines; and (d) preparing progress and implementation completion reports. A management and&#13;
technical assistance firm would also provide technical support to the PIU and the participating banks for&#13;
screening and evaluating the environmental investment proposals.  Before negotiations, the GOE&#13;
designated the proiect manager.&#13;
4.03    The National Bank of Egypt (NBE) would sign with the GOE prior to loan effectiveness&#13;
financing agreements for passing on the proceeds of the IDA credit. NBE would establish the Grant and&#13;
the Credit Facilities and manage their fund flows in the concerned NBE concerned credit unit. As&#13;
mentioned in para. 2.16, NBE would also be a participating bank. It would negotiate and sign subsidiary&#13;
loan agreements with the participating banks. During negotiations, a draft subsidiary loan agreement&#13;
between the NBE and the Commercial International Bank. one participating bank was submitted to the&#13;
Bank for review. The execution of the subsidiarv loan agreement with this participating bank would be&#13;
a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.04    The participating banks would pre-screen environmental sub-projects proposed for funding by&#13;
the proposed project, assist firms in developing sub-projects in accordance with the agreed eligibility&#13;
criteria (para. 2.14), determine the financial viability of the enterprises, negotiate the sub-loan agreement&#13;
with the firms, take the commercial risk for loans to the firms, promote the program among its clients,&#13;
and report on a regular basis to the PIU on its project-related activities. The identification, evaluation,&#13;
and approval process of the environmental investments is outlined in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
4.05    The participating enterprises would sign a sub-loan/grant agreement and a sub-project agreement.&#13;
The sub-project agreement will be signed with EEAA and would detail the enterprise's commitment to:&#13;
(a) the sub-project objectives; (b) the preparation of a PAAP; (c) the procurement, installation and&#13;
operation of the equipment; (d) self-monitoring; (e) the measures to be taken to protect workers' health&#13;
and safety; and (f) notification to EEAA of the results of pollution reduction activity. The PIP provides&#13;
a sample of a sub-project agreement.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
4.06    Goods and Services. All procurement of goods and services for the provision of pollution&#13;
control equipment would be financed under the proposed Bank loan and IDA credit in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Domestic preference, for local manufacturers, in accordance with&#13;
the Guidelines would apply. The Bank would provide Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) which were&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
4.07    The procurement of field vehicles, computer, office and monitoring equipment, materials and&#13;
supplies for the technical and institutional support componenit would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
requirements of the GOF grant agreement.&#13;
4.08     Private and public sector enterprises would be responsible for unldertaking their own&#13;
procurement, with the assistance of the PIU, using the Bank's Development Finance Institution (DFI)&#13;
procedures.  During pre-appraisal, the Bank conducted a procurement assessment to determine the&#13;
procurement procedures used by the private and public sector firms and found them acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Individual contracts exceeding US$5.0 million for the private and public sector enterprises would&#13;
be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB). All contracts by the public sector enterprises&#13;
above US$200,000 and less than US$5.0 million will be carried either under ICB or Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB) depending whether the type of equipment justify direct invitation to a limited number of&#13;
manufacturers. Contracts below US$200,000 would be awarded on the basis of International Shopping&#13;
(IS). National Shopping (NS) would be used for small contracts below US$100,000. All contracts of&#13;
US$5.0 million or below for private sector companies will be carried out using applicable commercial&#13;
practices. Table 4. 1 shows the proposed procurement arrangements.&#13;
4.09    All procurement which follows Egyptian Procurement Law #9 will have to exclude the&#13;
unacceptable features of Government procurement procedures stated in para. a.3 (A) (ii) to (xi) in the&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) of April 5, 1994. In a circular to all implementing&#13;
agencies, the Government has authorized deviations from Law #9 which are not compatible with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
4.10     Since the industrial pollution control equipment would be disbursed against a line of credit, the&#13;
detailed procurement packages are not yet well defined. However, based on the priority industrial&#13;
enterprises in Annex 2, which consists of 21 sub-projects; three sub-projects include contracts for&#13;
purchasing a turn key lead smelter plant and dust fabric filters with values above US$5.0 million; these&#13;
would be purchased through ICB. Twelve sub-projects include contracts with values between US$5.0&#13;
million and US$200,000 for acquiring specialized equipment such as coke oven doors, fabric filters,&#13;
scrubbers and evaporation and acid regeneration units for existing plants. These could be purchased&#13;
through Limited International Bidding (LIB). Six other sub-projects include contracts of small monetary&#13;
values below US$200,000 to purchase equipment such as acid and salt recovery equipment and small size&#13;
filters. These would be purchased through quotation with three suppliers. It is expected that other sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution A batement Project                                                                                             19&#13;
projects would have similar type of procurement. The value of all these contracts will be further refined&#13;
after detailed engineering is completed.&#13;
4.11        Consultants. Consultants for various assignments (i.e engineering design, monitoring, training,&#13;
etc.) to be undertaken and financed from the IDA funds, would be recruited in accordance with the Bank&#13;
Guidelines. Their terms of reference will be subject to prior review by the Bank. Technical assistance&#13;
and training to be financed from the GOF grant, would be consolidated in one package for which TORs,&#13;
included in the PIP, were prepared and reviewed during appraisal by the Bank.&#13;
4.12        All contracts for goods and technical and engineering services above a threshold of US$5.0&#13;
million as well as appointments of consulting firms above US$100,000 and individual consultants above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to prior Bank review. These will constitute more than 50 percent of Bank-&#13;
financed goods and services. This is acceptable for a line of credit type of operation. All other contracts&#13;
would be subject of a post review  by the Bank. The PIU  would maintain all relevant documents in its&#13;
record for this purpose.&#13;

4.13            The proposed project would be implemented over six years starting on October Ist 1996 and&#13;
is expected to be completed by September 30, 2002 and closed by March 30, 2003. It is anticipated that the&#13;
Bank loan and IDA credit will be fully disbursed by that date. In case of EIB cofinancing, because the size&#13;

of the project would still be small relative to the demand of funds, the availability of the additional funds will&#13;
not slow down bank disbursements and should not require an extension of the closing date. The estimated&#13;
schedule of disbursement is summarized in Table 4.2.&#13;

4.14     The proposed Bank loan and credit would cover 100 percent of amounts paid by NBE and the&#13;
participating banks under sub-loans and sub-grants, which correspond to 90 percent of the sub-project&#13;
costs.&#13;
4.15     To facilitate prompt payments to suppliers and consultants, the Bank would advance funds to&#13;
establish and replenish two Special Accounts (SA) in US dollars at the NBE, for which a letter of comfort&#13;
is available at the Bank: (a) one SA for the IBRD loan with an initial deposit of US$2.0 million; and (b)&#13;
one SA for the IDA credit with an initial deposit of US$1.5 million. These funds would be used to cover&#13;
the Bank's shares of eligible expenditures in both local and foreign currencies over a period of four&#13;
months. Each special account would be replenished monthly upon receipt of reimbursement applications&#13;
with appropriate supporting documentation or when approximately half of the maximum amount allowed&#13;
has been spent whichever comes first. Monthly bank statements from the two SAs would accompany&#13;
replenishment requests. The minimum application size for direct payments and applications for Special&#13;
Commitment will be 20 percent of the authorized allocations of the Special Accounts.&#13;
4.16     The disbursement schedule is summarized in Table 4.3. Withdrawal for the second project&#13;
component would be presented to the Bank on the basis of SOEs. Relevant documentation in support of&#13;
SOEs would be made available to Bank supervision missions and to independent auditors by NBE and&#13;
the participating banks.&#13;

D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.17    The PIU, NBE and the participating banks would provide Bank staff with access to all financial&#13;
reports necessary to assess implementation progress, monitor compliance with loan and credit conditions&#13;
and ensure proper use of Bank loan proceeds and IDA credit. The SAs would be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the GOE and the Bank. The project accounts would be consolidated&#13;
for auditing by the independent auditors and the audited accounts, together with the auditor's opinion&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank within six months following the close of the Borrower's fiscal year, i.e.&#13;
June 30 of each year. All audits are to be carried out in accordance with international standards and terms&#13;
of reference for private firms would be subjected to the Bank's prior review. Audit reports would include&#13;
separate opinions on the functioning of the SAs and the use of the SOEs.&#13;
E. Project Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.18    The PIU and NBE would collectively submit a progress report annually to the Bank and an&#13;
implementation report within six months following the proposed project closing date. The annual progress&#13;
report would cover: (a) progress towards compliance with monitoring input and output indicators for the&#13;
institutional and environmental aspects as shown in Annex 8; (b) sub-projects screened and financed in&#13;
accordance with the eligibility criteria set forth in para. 2.12; (c) status of the procurement of equipment&#13;
and services, including revised timing of procurement actions such as bidding and contract awards; and&#13;
(d) status of expenditures from the credit and grant facilities.&#13;
4.19    Estimating the impact of the proposed project during implementation would be based on the&#13;
compilation by the PIU of two sets of data: (a) pollution discharge data (air emission and water discharge)&#13;
from the industrial enterprises, which would be the responsibility of the individual firms; and (b) ambient&#13;
data on air/water quality in the vicinity of the industrial facilities. The latter would be EEAA's&#13;
responsibility. The details of the audit as defined in the PIP, would be performed in such a way that the&#13;
base line and resulting environmental impacts from different mitigation options, to the extent possible,&#13;
could be evaluated and compared with or incorporated in the proposed project's environmental indicators.&#13;
Annex 8 provides a sample of the environmental indicators which were developed from the environmental&#13;
audits of the pipeline of sub-projects.&#13;
4.20    Project monitoring would be conducted during the joint Bank and GOF supervision missions&#13;
on the basis of the performance indicators in Annex 8 and the implementation schedule in Annex 9.&#13;
During the first year of implementation, the Bank plans to send three supervision missions for a total of&#13;
27 staff weeks; subsequently two missions for a total of 18 staff weeks per annum would suffice to&#13;
supervise all activities. During the first three years, supervision missions will be jointly undertaken by&#13;
GOF and Bank staff, international consultants to cover specialized industrial skills, the professional staff&#13;
of the Resident Mission, and local consultants. After the third year, it is anticipated that project&#13;
supervision will be primarily undertaken by the professional staff of the Resident Mission and by local&#13;
consultants who would have received on the job training during previous supervision missions. In addition&#13;
to the elements of the reporting requirements in para. 4.19 above, key areas of concern would include:&#13;
(a) compliance by the participating banks with the eligibility criteria in para. 2.14 above; (b) review of&#13;
the ambient and emission data; (c) installation and operation of environmental control equipment resulting&#13;
from the project; (d) progress in developing effective evaluation activities by the NGOs; (e) progress in&#13;
preparation of the GIPAP and follow up of the PAAPs by the governorate and EEAA; (f) number of&#13;
subsidiary loan agreements signed between NBE and other participating banks; and (g) replication of the&#13;
current sub-projects in the pipeline to other enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
4.21    A mid-term review would be conducted jointly by the Bank, the GOF and the PIU by September&#13;
1999. It would include inter alia: (a) performance of the Borrower, the executing agencies and&#13;
participating banks in achieving project objectives; (b) progress toward fulfilling key performance&#13;
indicators; (c) sub-projects completed or under implementation; (d) effectiveness of training and technical&#13;
assistance provided to the proposed project beneficiaries; (e) economic justification of the on-lending&#13;
program; and (f) progress made by the Borrower towards establishing an incentive framework for&#13;
environment protection (para. 1.15). Agreement was reached with the GOE on the mid term review&#13;
process to be scheduled by September 1999.&#13;
F. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.22    The project falls within category "B" in accordance with the provisions of O.D. 4.01,&#13;
"Environmental Assessment". The project would result in reductions in air, water, solid, and hazardous&#13;
pollutants by supporting environmental investments at industrial plants. This in turn would lead to&#13;
improvements in the health and safety of the workers in the industrial plants and the general population&#13;
near those plants. To prevent possible adverse environmental impacts, the project would require the&#13;
preparation of environmental audits for all investment-financed operations (para. 2.14). The audits would&#13;
be consistent with the guidelines recently issued by the Bank in the Environmental Assessment Source&#13;
Book Update No 11, "Environmental Auditing". The Bank guidelines on environmental auditing will be&#13;
translated into Arabic and shared with EEAA, the enterprises and the participating banks. Environmental&#13;
audits would be reviewed by EEAA and the Bank supervision missions. In addition, environmental&#13;
guidelines and procedures for implementation of the provisions of the Environment Protection Law were&#13;
reviewed by the Bank during pre-appraisal. It was found that enterprises are expected to conform to the&#13;
national emissions standards and discharges which are expressed in the form of concentrations. Since it&#13;
is possible to meet these standards by dilution, without any real reduction in pollution, the proposed&#13;
project would provide in its first sub-component (para. 2.04), technical assistance to enable EEAA to shift&#13;
to discharges and emission standards on a load basis. This would further contribute to promoting pollution&#13;
prevention and waste minimization. Furthermore, the sub-project agreement which would be signed with&#13;
EEAA by the enterprise (para. 4.05) will ensure that among other factors, industrial waste would be&#13;
minimized.&#13;
G. Sustainability&#13;
4.23    The project would strengthen the monitoring and enforcement capabilities of environmental&#13;
institutions and establish the technical and financial mechanisms for pollution abatement investments. A&#13;
nexus of factors is expected to yield sustained (and expanded) investment in pollution abatement&#13;
technology after project completion. These factors include a credible enforcement threat; increased&#13;
knowledge regarding the efficacy of pollution abatement investment; and an examination of the overall&#13;
pricing and tax regime from an environmental point of view. The project directly addresses the first two&#13;
factors. The credibility of the enforcement threat is enhanced through the Technical and Institutional&#13;
Support component of the project and the Government commitment to enforce the law and to request that&#13;
governorates and enterprises prepare their own pollution abatement action plans. Since the Egyptian firms&#13;
are not familiar with pollution abatement investments, firms making the first investments of this type will&#13;
incur significant information costs. Initially, the grant and technical assistance features of this project will&#13;
provide the inducement for firms to incur these transaction costs and undertake this new type of&#13;
investment activity. After a core of such investments are made, Egyptian firms will be more familiar with&#13;
such investments. Furthermore, the funding mechanism, if successfully demonstrated, would stimulate&#13;
lending by the banking sector given that the proposed project would provide training to bank officers on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                              23&#13;
how to evaluate potential environmental investments and to recognize and market such opportunities to&#13;
their customers. The lower information cost will mitigate the need for technical assistance and grant&#13;
inducements.&#13;
4.24    The third factor mentioned above involves several mechanisms (in lieu of a grant component)&#13;
that would increase the financial rate of return for firmns seeking to make pollution abatement investments.&#13;
The first mechanism is the possible introduction of environmental taxes on polluting energy fuels, leaded&#13;
gasoline, agrochemicals, hazardous substances and polluting discharges which are being considered in the&#13;
context of replacing tariff revenue that will be lost with the expected free trade agreement with the&#13;
European Union. The second mechanism is further progress on cost recovery so as to provide incentives&#13;
for efficient resource allocation. While cost recovery is still incomplete, Egypt has made progress in&#13;
recent years. Electricity and domestic petroleum are now priced at 80 percent and 90 percent of their&#13;
intemational level, respectively (para. 1.03). Recent Govemment interest in attracting private investors&#13;
in infrastructure projects (i.e., Build-Operate-and-Transfer in power generation) will require more attention&#13;
to cost recovery issues. There are of course, risks, that this sustainable environment would not materialize.&#13;
However, in its discussions with the Bank, indications are good that the Government is serious about&#13;
enforcement. In addition, other market incentives in the form of cost recovery, increased access of&#13;
pollution control technology, and the introduction of environmental taxes could create a sustained demand&#13;
on the parts of firms for investment in pollution abatement technology.&#13;
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION AND PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.01    The major benefit of the Technical and Institutional Support Component is the increased&#13;
capacity for monitoring and enforcement. This added capacity will yield significant benefits in terms of&#13;
contributing substantially to lowering the current social costs of environmental degradation and reducing&#13;
the inefficiencies of the previously fragmented system of enforcement in the country. This component&#13;
would strengthen the regional and local capabilities in monitoring and enforcement of appropriate policies&#13;
and regulations. It would also benefit the local NGOs, their constituencies and the media and increase&#13;
their participation in monitoring the actions of the Governorate and enterprises for pollution control. This&#13;
would generate public support for environmental efforts and create a public expectation for enterprises&#13;
to adopt good environmental and safety practices. The technical assistance to the plants would help them&#13;
evaluate low cost/no cost and pollution prevention options, as well as more expensive environmental&#13;
investments. These options would not only reduce emissions but may also improve plant efficiency and&#13;
product quality, and lower costs for energy and raw materials.&#13;
5.02    Under its second component, the project would provide financial resources to individual&#13;
enterprises for environmental investments. It would contribute to a reduction of air and water pollutants&#13;
and wastes, and would improve the health conditions and safety of the workers, and the population living&#13;
near these industries. These investments are expected to be used as examples throughout Egyptian&#13;
industry and thus the project's impact would extend beyond the specific investments being funded. This&#13;
project component would also enhance environmental quality by introducing innovative and replicable&#13;
market mechanisms for environmental management that simultaneously develop collaboration between the&#13;
financial sector, the regulatory/enforcement institutions and industrial enterprises. The main beneficiaries&#13;
of the project are the 220 environment staff of the ministries and the governorates, 200 trainees from the&#13;
financial and industrial sectors, the local NGOs and professional associations, the enterprises' workers,&#13;
and the general population exposed to pollution from the enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

24                                                                          Pollution Abatement Project&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.03      A complete economic and financial analysis of the proposed project cannot be undertaken as&#13;
the project will finance technical assistance and training and an undetermined number of sub-projects on&#13;
a first come-first serve basis subject to environmental criteria. The benefits of the elements of the&#13;
technical and institutional support component cannot been quantified. However, this component represents&#13;
a key element in the sustainability of overall project benefits. The second project component is a pollution&#13;
abatement fund consisting of a line of credit and limited matching grants for financing pollution abatement&#13;
sub-projects. Sub-project justification is based on pollution reduction in industrial enterprises in order to&#13;
move towards compliance with the Environmental Law for the protection of human health and/or natural&#13;
resources, rather than on purely economic benefit. Most environmental benefits, and particularly those&#13;
related to human health impacts, cannot be subjected to a benefit-cost analysis as functional relationships&#13;
between health impacts and reductions in various pollutants are not yet adequately determined. However,&#13;
functional relationships have been relatively well established for total suspended particulates (TSP) and&#13;
lead. A benefit-cost analysis, described in Annex 10, was therefore undertaken for the sub-projects in the&#13;
pre-screened pipeline which would reduce TSP and lead and could be financed under the PAF:&#13;
Sub-project I:      Installation of a new  lead smelting process to reduce lead emissions in&#13;
Helwan;&#13;
Sub-project 2:      Installation of air filters to reduce particulate emissions in an iron and steel&#13;
plant in Shubra El Kheima; and&#13;
Sub-project 3:      Installation of air filters to reduce particulate emissions in a coke and&#13;
chemicals plant in Helwan.&#13;
5.04      Using a dose-response model, which provides a relationship between health impacts and changes&#13;
in concentration levels of total suspended particulates (TSP) and lead, the benefit-cost analysis provided&#13;
the following estimates in Table 5.1&#13;

Excluding taxes.&#13;
2 The applied discount rate is 12 percent.&#13;
The corresponding ERRs are 30 percent, 33 percent and 18 percent for the three sub-projects.&#13;
Sub-project 3 includes two large and two small investments among which the enterprise can select and submit&#13;
financing proposal.&#13;
5.05      The estimates are conservative insofar as valuation and/or avoided health impacts in the analysis&#13;
are at the lower end of commonly applied ranges, and the monetary benefit of reductions of other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Abatement Project                                                                               25&#13;
pollutants in sub-projects 2 and 3 are not included because the functional relationship between the health&#13;
impacts and those pollutants are not yet adequately determined.&#13;
C. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&#13;
5.06      Cost-effectiveness would be determined in the environmental audit to assess the viability of&#13;
investment sub-projects for which the environmental benefits cannot be quantified. However, pollution&#13;
reductions are nevertheless required to comply with the Environment Protection Law. The approach to&#13;
cost effectiveness is to emphasize pollution control and prevention through investment in process changes.&#13;
Such investments often have significant financial benefits in terms of savings on or elimination of the use&#13;
of chemicals or other toxic substances, reductions in energy and water consumption and/or other&#13;
production inputs. End-of-pipe investments, with no or low financial benefits, will be financed only if&#13;
process change options are unavailable to move towards compliance with the Environmental Law.&#13;
D. Financial Analysis&#13;
5.07      A financial evaluation of identified first tranche sub-projects could be made on the basis of the&#13;
environmental audits completed during project preparation. Of the environmental audits in 18 enterprises,&#13;
identified investments in 11 enterprises are deemed a first priority from an environmental perspective.&#13;
Investments totaling US$36.4 million (excluding taxes and duties of US$3.0 million) have been proposed&#13;
for the 11 enterprises.&#13;
5.08      Investments are classified as: (1) no/low cost; (2) process changes; and (3) end-of-pipe. The&#13;
pay-back periods and financial IRR are summarized in Table 5.2 for the investments in the 11 enterprises.&#13;

E. Project Risks&#13;
5.09    There are four major risks to project implementation:&#13;
(a) Institutional. The key risk is that if enforcement is not sufficiently strengthened, the&#13;
industries may not have enough incentive to make use of the PAF or to undertake abatement&#13;
measures.  This risk would be reduced under the project by: (i) strengthening the&#13;
enforcement entities in the priority geographic areas; (ii) providing financial incentives to&#13;
industrial plants; and (iii) mobilizing public opinion through NGOs and the media.&#13;
(b) Financial. There is an associated risk that the on-lending terms and conditions could&#13;
become uncompetitive because of the availability of grants and soft loans from bilateral&#13;
donors. This risk is inevitable in Egypt where nine donors are engaged in industrial&#13;
pollution studies and activities. However, this risk would be minimized under the project&#13;
by: (i) undertaking periodic consultations with the bilateral donors on the on-lending&#13;
conditions and grant arrangements; (ii) reviewing periodically the maximum percentage of&#13;
the grant component; and (iii) effectively delivering technical assistance with project funds.&#13;
(c) Managerial. The institutional component focuses on enforcement and financial institutions&#13;
which have limited experience and in house capabilities for environmental management and&#13;
environmental lending. To minimize this risk, the institutional component is mostly directed&#13;
to building up, through technical assistance and training, the capabilities of these&#13;
organizations in enforcement and in evaluating potential environmental investments.&#13;
(d) Implementation Capacity. Egypt has a track record of inadequate implementation&#13;
performance. This risk would be minimized under the project by : (i) establishing an&#13;
operational PIU as soon as the project is negotiated; (ii) completing the procurement&#13;
arrangements of the pipeline of sub-projects so that they could be financed as soon as the&#13;
PAF is made operational; (iii) providing training in procurement and disbursement to the&#13;
executing agencies;  and (iv) delegating the procurement review and disbursement&#13;
monitoring responsibilities to the Resident Mission in Egypt.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.01    The conditions for negotiations included: (a) the nomination of the project manager (para. 4.02);&#13;
(b) the submission of a draft subsidiary financing agreement between the GOE and the NBE for passing&#13;
on the IDA proceeds (para. 4.03); and (c) the submission by NBE of a draft subsidiary loan agreement&#13;
with one participating bank (para. 4.03).&#13;
6.02    During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained from the Government:&#13;
(a) EEAA would submit annually the implementation schedule for the preparation of the&#13;
enterprises' PAAPs for the 40 worst polluters [para. 2.04 (b)];&#13;
(b) EEAA would adopt the conditions and eligibility criteria for sub-project appraisal (para.&#13;
2.14);&#13;
&#13;

(c) The Government would agree that NBE provides non-refundable grants from the grant&#13;
facility to eligible private and public industrial enterprises (para. 2.18);&#13;
(d) The National Bank of Egypt would on-lend proceeds of the IBRD loan to participating&#13;
banks on terms satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.03);&#13;
(e) EEAA would agree on the performance indicators and would agree to submit every two&#13;
years a report on the progress towards fulfilling these indicators (para. 4.20); and&#13;
(f) The PIU and the Bank would undertake a mid-term review of the project by September&#13;
1999 (para. 4.21).&#13;
6.03    The conditions for loan and credit effectiveness would be: (a) the execution of the financing&#13;
agreements between the NBE and GOE; and (b) the signing of one subsidiary loan agreement between&#13;
NBE and one of the participating banks (para. 4.03).&#13;

POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN CAIRO AND ALEXANDRIA&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
1.     The number of industries in Egypt with more than 10 employees totals about 22,000', almost 1000&#13;
of which are public sector enterprises. The number of employees in the industrial sectors has been&#13;
estimated to be about 2 million, half of which are employed by the private sector, mainly consisting of&#13;
small and medium  scale industries.  Industrial share of GDP was 21.1 percent in 1994, while the&#13;
manufacturing share was 14.7 percent. Industrial public enterprises (PEs) account for nearly 60 percent&#13;
of manufacturing output.&#13;
2.     The major polluters are predominantly the metallurgical, chemical, refinery, cement, and pulp and&#13;
paper industrial sectors. Food, engineering, textile, and tannery industries, representing both larger public&#13;
enterprises and medium and small scale private industries, also add to the pollution load in Egypt.&#13;
3.     Many of the PEs started their production in the 1960s and have not modernized their equipment&#13;
since. Many of them are using outdated processes and are not controlling their emissions. The private&#13;
owned enterprises expanded mainly since the 1980s and are comparably modem and less polluting. It&#13;
should be noted that there exist small and medium-scale private industries, especially in the tannery and&#13;
metallurgical sectors, which are also heavy polluters.&#13;
4.     The two largest cities of Greater Cairo and Metropolitan Alexandria which account for over 80&#13;
percent of the industrial activity in Egypt are the most polluted in Egypt. The public sector accounts for&#13;
55 percent of enterprises, 37 percent from the private sector and 8 percent are joint ventures with private&#13;
capital.&#13;
5.     Greater Cairo with a total population of 15 million and 126 PEs, includes the governorates of&#13;
Cairo, Guizeh and part of Qaliubiya. The areas with the severest pollution are: (a) the Helwan-Tebbin&#13;
industrial zone south of Cairo, (b) the Shubra El Kheima, Mostorod and Abuzaabal zone north of Cairo,&#13;
and (c) Imbaba east of Cairo. The Helwan-Tebbin zone includes 90 large and small industries of which&#13;
the 18 major polluters are the cement, iron and steel, coke, lead smelter, refractory, automotive and&#13;
military factories. Shubra El Kheima-Mostorod includes 40 heavy industries such as steel plants, paper&#13;
production, a refinery, and a fertilizer plant as well as 1300 medium and small scale industrial enterprises&#13;
such as metal foundry, food processing, detergent and soap manufacturing, textile, and glass industries.&#13;
Imbaba is the site of the largest concentration of industry on the West Bank of the Nile. Major industrial&#13;
operations include the shipyard, food, textile metal products and paint industries. Approximately 800&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
smaller scale, privately owned, industries are located throughout Cairo. These include 52 tanneries&#13;
discharging toxic substances such as chromium, 12 lead smelters as well as many other metal smelters.&#13;
6.      Alexandria with a population of 4.0 million accounts over 40% of the industrial activity in Egypt.&#13;
Its most polluted areas are the Max-El Dikheila industrial zone in the west and Abu Qir east of the city&#13;
center. The Max-El Dikheila industrial zone includes heavy industries of iron and steel, cement refinery&#13;
and chemicals as well the tanneries. Abu Qir includes large fertilizer plants and pulp and paper industry&#13;
of Egypt.&#13;
7.     A comparative risk analysis of environmental problems affecting Greater Cairo was carried out&#13;
by USAID in 1993-1994. The health risk ranking displayed in Table 1, indicated that air pollution caused&#13;
by particulate matter (PM) and lead as well as drinking water contamination from chemicals are the causes&#13;
of the most severe health effects. Since the industrial activities is a major source of pollution, an overview&#13;
of air and water pollution in Cairo and Alexandria is provided below.&#13;
B.    Water Pollution from Industry&#13;
8.     Data on water discharges from industry in Egypt is incomplete which makes it difficult to draw&#13;
an accurate picture of the pollution situation. Hence, pollution data provided are also very uncertain since&#13;
no regular emission monitoring is performed by industries or authorities.&#13;
9.     The total waste water discharge from 314 major public industries in Egypt is of the order of 335&#13;
million m3 per year2. Of this amount the discharges in Greater Cairo account for roughly 130 Mm3/y and&#13;
Alexandria for 90 Mm3/y. Of those flows the ten largest dischargers in each city are discharging in total&#13;
100 and 65 Mm3/y. The major water discharging industries in Greater Cairo are: (a) metallurgical&#13;
industries, such as Delta Steel, Egyptian Iron and Steel, and National Metals with 9, 11, and 24 Mm3/y&#13;
of discharge; (b) sugar industries such as Egyptian Sugar and Integrated Industries with two plants with&#13;
13 and 18 Mm3/y respectively; and (c) El Nasr Coke and Chemicals with 6 Mm3/y of discharge. In&#13;
Alexandria the Rakta pulp and paper plant with a discharge of 22 Mm3/y is heavily polluting the Abu Kir&#13;
bay with black liquor. The National Paper company with a discharge of 7 Mm3/y is another major&#13;
source. Other large sources in Alexandria are industries in the chemical, metallurgical, and textile sectors.&#13;
10.    The industries with large wastewater discharges normally are also large polluters. But in addition&#13;
industries with more limited water discharges, such as starch producers and tanneries, could be major&#13;
sources for releases of organic substances or heavy metals. Table 2 provides more detailed information&#13;
on the discharges from the major sources based on discharge flow in Greater Cairo and Alexandria.&#13;
11.    Water quality data show that the water quality of the Nile has deteriorated since the late 1970s.&#13;
The canal systems supplied by water from the Nile and delta lakes such as Lake Maryut and Lake&#13;
Manzala contain high concentrations of organic matter and/or heavy metals. It is believed that heavy&#13;
pollution loads from industries have contributed significantly to the deterioration. Furthermore, impact&#13;
from pollution is detected in the coastal waters of Alexandria where mercury levels are highly elevated&#13;
due to discharges from a chlor-alkali plant west of Alexandria.&#13;

12.    Drinking water for the over 4 million people in the Alexandria metropolitan area is provided from&#13;
the Mahmoudia Canal, Nile Rosetta Branch, and Noubaria Canal. Located downstream of the country's&#13;
water system, with the full load of upstream pollution, the drinking water quality has deteriorated. In the&#13;
areas served by the Noubaria Canal, the total dissolved solids (TDS) are about three times higher than the&#13;
WHO guideline value.&#13;
C.    Air Pollution from Industry&#13;
13.    Data on air emissions from industries in Egypt are also very scarce. Monitoring of releases is not&#13;
a standard procedure in industry. The available ambient air quality data indicate that the most severely&#13;
affected areas in Egypt are the Helwan area south of Cairo, the Shubra El-Kheima, Mustorod and Abu-&#13;
Zaabal areas north of Cairo, and areas west and east of Alexandria.&#13;
14.    Compared to international standards, the ambient concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP)&#13;
in the above monitored areas in Cairo is 5-10 times higher, sulfur dioxide (SO2) 2-20 times higher, smoke&#13;
about 3 times higher, lead 2-20 times higher and nitrogen oxides (NOJ) 2 times higher (Table 3). The&#13;
pollution level in Cairo is higher than in any of 20 largest cities in the World for which the Bank has data.&#13;
The average human blood lead levels are about 30 g.g/dl for adults and 20 1tg/dl for children. Those&#13;
average levels are also higher than in any city, except Bangkok, for which the Bank has data. Children&#13;
living close to lead smelters have an average of over 604. g/dl and 15-year-old in Helwan and Shubra El-&#13;
Kheima have an average of 40 - 50 Lg/dl. The situation is less severe in Alexandria but the concentration&#13;
of pollutants is still much higher than the international standards.&#13;
15.    The USAID-financed health risk assessment estimated that if lead emissions are reduced in Cairo&#13;
to the level of the US ambient lead standard, a reduction of 6,500-11,600 heart attacks, 800-1,400 strokes,&#13;
6,300- 11,100 cardiovascular deaths and 800-900 infant deaths per year would be achieved. In addition,&#13;
lead pollution was found to cause an average loss of 4.25 IQ points per child. The increased level of&#13;
particulate matter in Greater Cairo causes 90-270 million restricted activity days and 3,300-16,000 extras&#13;
deaths per year.&#13;
16.    Large point sources in the metallurgical, chemical (including refineries), and cement industries are&#13;
major contributors to the air deterioration in Greater Cairo and Alexandria. The emissions from those&#13;
sectors emanate both from the processes and the large use of fossil fuels. The metal and chemical&#13;
industries consumed 2.2 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) of fuel in 1989 resulting in large SO2 and&#13;
NO, emissions affecting the ambient air quality. Medium scale industries such as brick works, refractories&#13;
and small scale metallurgical plants are also contributing to the reduced air quality in those cities.&#13;
17.    The metallurgical sector in Egypt includes both ore-based and scrap-based steel plants, ferro-&#13;
alloys, copper, lead, and aluminum smelters. Two metallurgical plants the Egypt Iron and Steel Co, an&#13;
integrated iron and steel plant, and General Metals, a metal smelter producing lead and other metals from&#13;
scrap, are located in Helwan. North of Cairo are the scrap-based steel plants Delta Steel and National&#13;
Metals. In addition there are several small scale metallurgical industries in Greater Cairo. There are 13&#13;
small lead smelters in addition to General Metals. Lead emissions from the lead smelters in Cairo have&#13;
been estimated to over 500 t/y. In Alexandria one large steel plant - Alexandria National Steel - and the&#13;
scrap-based copper smelter Egyptian Copper Works, Misr Chemicals and Abu Qir Fertilizers are major&#13;
sources of air pollution. The emissions from the steel industry are given in Table 4. The data are based&#13;
on audits prepared or information collected by the design team during the preparation of this project. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
should be realized that steel works dust could contain a significant percentage of heavy metals (over 30&#13;
% in scrap-based production).&#13;
18.   The cement industry in Egypt consists of 8 major plants, 3 of which are situated in Helwan, two&#13;
in Alexandria, one in Suez, one in Beni Suef, and one in Assyout. The production capacity of the plants&#13;
in Greater Cairo and Alexandria adds up to more than 10 million tons per year. A major part (60%) of&#13;
the production in these plants uses the more polluting and uneconomical wet process instead of the dry&#13;
one. The energy input needed for a wet process is roughly 1.5-2 times higher than a dry process&#13;
dependent on the degree of preheating and pre-calcination. NO, emission from a wet process is on&#13;
average roughly 4.5 kg per ton of clinker but could range up to about 9 kg/t. Dry processes could range&#13;
from roughly 0.5 to 4.5 kg/t. Based on those figures, the total NO, emissions for the Cairo and&#13;
Alexandria plants would be over 20,000 tons per year. The total dust emissions from the same plants are&#13;
over 250,000 t/y according to one source. Another source claims 600,000 tly. One of the reasons for&#13;
the exceedingly high dust emission is said to be that the electrostatic precipitator are not operating well&#13;
or at all, mainly because of difficulties to reuse the filter dust.&#13;
19.    Another source in Helwan which negatively affects the air quality is the El Nasr Coke &amp; Chemical&#13;
which releases carcinogenic poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, ammonia, hydrogen sulfides and dust. The audit&#13;
prepared for this project estimates the emissions of dust, hydrocarbons, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide to&#13;
roughly 3,400 tons, 3800 tons, 280 tons, and 63 tons respectively.&#13;
20.   No emission data have been made available on the refineries in Cairo and the Alexandria&#13;
Metropolitan Area which are major sources of pollution. Experience elsewhere shows the releases of&#13;
sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons could be expected to be high. Based on production levels for the&#13;
Alexandria and Amreya refineries (4.5 and 3 million tons respectively) in the Alexandria Metropolitan&#13;
Area, the magnitude of released pollutants has been estimated by use of emission factors. The estimated&#13;
total emission of SO25 NOR, and VOCs are 7,500, 1,500, and 7,500 tons per year respectively. It should&#13;
be noted that there is great unce.tainty about those estimates, especially for SO2 releases for which it was&#13;
assumed that both refineries have sulfur recovery processes.&#13;

POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT COSTS&#13;
1.    The estimated project costs is LE 191.7 million, or US$48.7 million. The foreign exchange&#13;
component of LE 156.4 million, or US$48.7 million, represents 83.9 percent of total costs. These&#13;
estimates are based on December 1995 prices and exclude taxes and duties. These were estimated in&#13;
the first project component at 100 percent for vehicles, 10-30 percent on monitoring and computer&#13;
equipment. In the second component, a 10 percent tax was estimated for capital industrial equipment.&#13;
2.     Price and cost contingencies were estimated on the first project component only since the&#13;
second project component is a credit line with fixed amount. A 10% physical contingency was&#13;
estimated on the equipment cost of the first project component and price contingencies have been&#13;
based on a 7 per cent increase annually for local costs and 2 per cent increase annually for foreign&#13;
costs.&#13;
3.     The project provides for an estimated 323 person-months of long and short term consulting&#13;
services for the first project component. The cost of these services is based on average consultant&#13;
month of US$18,000 for foreign consultants and US$4700 for local consultants. These rates compose&#13;
individual and overhead fees, local allowances and, in the case of foreign consultants, international&#13;
travel and subsistence.&#13;
4.     The attached tables show a breakdown of project costs of the first project component and the&#13;
cost associated with the local management services of the PIU.&#13;

POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTICIPATING BANKS&#13;
A. The Commercial International Bank (CIB)&#13;
1.    CIB was incorporated in 1975 as a joint venture bank between NBE and Chase Manhattan&#13;
Overseas Banking Corporation. Chase Manhattan sold its share to NBE in 1987. NBE continues to be&#13;
a major shareholder, but its share has declined from virtually 100 percent in 1987 to 42.15 percent in&#13;
1994. CIB operates fully independently of NBE, the bank has good internal systems, including an internal&#13;
audit department, and its procedures for credit appraisal, approval and monitoring are well developed.&#13;
2.     CIB is the largest joint venture bank in Egypt in terms of total loans. The bank's loan portfolio&#13;
was LE 3,484 million in 1994, and concentrated in the industrial sector (62 percent), but almost&#13;
exclusively among quality private enterprises. Less than 3 percent of the loan portfolio is in the public&#13;
sector. Total loans increased by 26 percent from 1993 to 1994. The bank is the most profitable large&#13;
commercial bank in Egypt. Return on average assets increased steadily from 1.98 percent in 1990 to 3.42&#13;
percent in 1994. Operations are well automated. The bank attracts well qualified staff, and places strong&#13;
emphasis on training.&#13;
B.    The Cairo Barclays Bank { (CBB)-Banque du Caire Barclays International SAE}&#13;
3.     CBB was established in 1975 as a joint venture bank between Banque du Caire and Barclays&#13;
International. The bank has an authorized capital of LE 100 million while the issued and paid up capital&#13;
is LE 50 million. The bank has three branches in Cairo and one in Alexandria.&#13;
4.     The bank's loan portfolio was LE 872 million in 1994 was diversified in the industria! (22&#13;
percent), service (54 percent), trade ( 7 percent), agricultural (8 percent) and other (9 percent).&#13;
Total loans increased by 21 percent from 1993 to 1994 mainly as a result of the increase in industrial&#13;
loans. Return on average assets was 0.4 percent in 1994, similar to 1993. In 1995, the CBB was selected&#13;
as the Agent Bank for the EU Private Sector Financial Scheme worth ECU 52.5 million ( US$68.2 million&#13;
equivalent) and designed to promote long term private sector investment projects.&#13;
C. The Misr International Bank (MIB)&#13;
5.     MIB was founded in 1975 as a joint venture bank. Bank Misr holds 58.1 percent of the shares,&#13;
but intends to gradually reduce its holding. Top management in MlBank are largely ex-Bank Misr&#13;
officers, and the chairman and deputy chairman are seconded from Bank Misr. Automation is very&#13;
advanced by Egyptian standards. The bank has strong commitment to training.&#13;
6.     MIB is the largest joint venture bank in Egypt in terms of assets, and second largest in terms of&#13;
total loans. The bank's loan portfolio was LE 2,293 million in 1994, and concentrated in industry (25&#13;
percent) and services (61 percent), with almost 90 percent in the private sector. Total loans increased by&#13;
7 percent from 1993 to 1994. Return on average assets was 0.85 percent in 1994, which is 30 percent&#13;
higher than in 1993. This is low compared to CIB and EAB. but substantially higher than for the public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

banks. The main reasons for the low profitability compared to CIB and EAB are low level of funds&#13;
utilization, high dependence on time deposits (high cost of funds), and its above average operating&#13;
expenses.&#13;
D. The Egyptian American Bank (EAB)&#13;
7.    EAB was established in 1976 as a joint venture bank between Bank of Alexandria (51 percent)&#13;
and American Express Bank (49 percent). The managing director and heads of credit and operations are&#13;
seconded by American Express (AMEX). The bank's operations are fully automated. Internal systems&#13;
and control are of high standard and based on those of Amex.&#13;
8.    The bank's loan portfolio was LE 1,258 million in 1994, and concentrated in industry (49 percent)&#13;
and services (28 percent). Almost 99 percent of total loans is in the private sector. Total loans increased&#13;
by 16 percent from 1993 to 1994. Return on average assets was 2.63 percent in 1994, up from 2.27&#13;
percent in 1993 but only marginally higher than in 1991. EAB continues to be highly profitable relative&#13;
to most other Egyptian banks, and well managed.&#13;

POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
OPTIONS FOR PROVIDING GRANTS TO INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
1.    Many countries have found that financial incentive mechanisms are necessary to facilitate rapid&#13;
industrial investments and other measures to reduce pollution and comply with environmental regulations.&#13;
The most common mechanism is to provide grants to offset some portion of sub-project cost.&#13;
2.    Four approaches or a combination of theses, may be considered for allocation of grants:&#13;
(a)    A grant rate/size based on the environmental benefit of the sub-project&#13;
(b)    A flat grant rate for all qualifying sub-projects&#13;
(c)    A grant rate based on the financial payback of a sub-project&#13;
(d)    A grant to compensate for the cost of specific sub-project components.&#13;
B.    Description Of Options&#13;
3.    Grant based on the Environmental Benefit: Under this approach higher levels of grants are giv-n&#13;
for sub-projects with higher levels of environmental benefit, and the grant level could also be adjusted in&#13;
recognition of the financial return that a company may obtain from the sub-project. This approach,&#13;
however, is highly complex as there is no absolute standard against which to determine an appropriate&#13;
grant level in relation to reductions in different pollutants in different locations. Thus the approach could&#13;
become arbitrary with lack of transparency and consistency across sub-projects.&#13;
4.    A Flat Grant Rate: This approach treats all qualifying sub-projects equally and awards grants on&#13;
the basis of a flat percentage rate of the sub-project cost. Qualifications for grants can be based on&#13;
environmental criteria that need not involve highly complex valuation of environmental benefits. The&#13;
main attraction of this approach is that it is transparent and therefore administratively easy to implement.&#13;
A drawback of the approach is that it makes no distinction between sub-projects that are financially&#13;
attractive to a company and sub-projects for which financial returns are insufficient to otherwise merit the&#13;
sub-project.&#13;
5.    A Grant Rate based on Sub-Project Financial Payback: This approach awards grants on the basis&#13;
of the financial payback of a qualifying sub-project, with the level of the grant in inverse relation to the&#13;
payback period. The attractiveness of this approach is that it links the achievement of environmental&#13;
objectives to a company self-interest in undertaking sub-projects that meet environmental objectives. Thus&#13;
sub-projects that have rapid payback to the company are sub-projects that are attractive for a company to&#13;
undertake and are not supported by grant financing, although technical and other assistance may still be&#13;
provided to such sub-projects. The principal drawback to this approach lies in determining the payback&#13;
period. A company has strong incentives to overstate the payback period, and the future stream of costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
and benefits are associated with uncertainty.&#13;
6.     Grant to Compensate For the Cost of SRecific Sub-Project ComRonents: This approach awards&#13;
grants to offset the cost of selected sub-project components related to pre- and post-investments costs such&#13;
as design engineering, civil works, commissioning, training and self monitoring. A estimate was made of&#13;
these costs using three sizes of sub-projects: (a) over US$5.0 million; (b) between US$5.0 and US$1.0&#13;
million; and (c) less than US$1.0 million. Calculations showed that these costs vary from 30 percent (for&#13;
a sub-project size of less the US$1.0 million) to 17.5 percent (for a sub-project size of more than US$5.0&#13;
million) of the equipment costs. This corresponds to an average of 20 percent of the investment costs.&#13;
The drawback of this approach is that it is neither linked to the fnancial nor the environmental benefit&#13;
of the sub-project. Moreover, the assessment of component cost can be difficult if for instance the&#13;
company carries out the component (i.e. design engineering, civil works). This approach could also&#13;
provide adverse incentives to undertake sub-projects with a large cost share on components that qualify&#13;
for grants.&#13;
C.    Grant determination&#13;
7.     Sub-Projects should meet environmental criteria set forth in the SAR para. 2.14 to qualify for&#13;
grants. The mechanism for determining the grant share of sub-project cost should be transparent and easy&#13;
to administer. On this basis, a grant share based on quantified environmental benefits or tied to specific&#13;
sub-project components are the least attractive approaches. To assess the relative merits of a flat grant&#13;
rate versus a grant rate in inverse relation to the payback period of sub-projects, environmental audits&#13;
carried out in 18 industrial enterprises can be reviewed.&#13;
8.    Of the environmental investments' sub-projects in the 18 enterprises, priority investments were&#13;
identified in 11 of these enterprises, estimated at about US$36.4 million (excluding taxes and duties). The&#13;
estimated payback period and financial rate of return on the investments are (by percentage share of total&#13;
investments identified:&#13;
Share of total investments      Payback period (yrs)         Financial rate of return'&#13;

(b)     - 6 percent                     -4 to 5.5                   -13% to 21%&#13;

(d)     - 5 percent                     -8.5 to 9                    - 2% to 3%&#13;

(f)     - 54 percent                   no payback                     no return&#13;
9.     This profile indicates that almost 94 percent of the priority investments are financially unattractive.&#13;
Even the investments with payback in 4-5.5 years are not likely to be considered top priority by&#13;
enterprises solely from a financial return, and the estimated payback period is associated with some degree&#13;
of uncertainty. The profile of priority environmental investment sub-projects that eventually will be&#13;
financed by the PAF may change. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that most of the qualifying investments&#13;
Financial rate of return is based on a useful life of investment of 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

would be financially attractive without a grant.&#13;
10.   Investments in category (c) and (f) constitute more than 85 percent of total identified priority&#13;
investments, and will also result in the majority of pollution reduction. Thus grants allocated to&#13;
investment sub-projects in these categories are the most important in terms of total grants awarded as well&#13;
as the extent to which the grants induce overall pollution reduction. A grant share of 20 percent of&#13;
investment sub-project cost (exclusive of taxes and duties) would increase the estimated financial rate of&#13;
return to about 11-12 percent for the investments in (c). The return would still be below what may be&#13;
considered priority investments by enterprises. However, a 20 percent grant shculd be a sufficient&#13;
incentive for enterprises to undertake the investments, given that enterprises are expected to comply with&#13;
the Environmental Law after the grace period. Such grant portion falls within the rang, of the pre- and&#13;
post-investment costs described in para 6. above&#13;
11.    A somewhat lower than 20 percent grant share may be considered sufficient to induce the&#13;
investments in (b), and a somewhat higher than 20 percent share for the investments in (d). However,&#13;
given some uncertainty in the estimated payback and rate of return, and the enterprise incentive to&#13;
overstate payback period if the grant is linked inversely to payback period, it would be difficult to specify&#13;
a grant share at a particular level higher or lower than 20 percent. For transparency and ease of&#13;
administration, a 20 percent grant share for investments in (b) and (d), as for investments in (c), is&#13;
determined appropriate. Similarly, investments in (e) would also be awarded a 20 percent grant.&#13;
Investments in (a) would not receive a grant, given that rate of return is considered sufficiently high even&#13;
with a very high error margin in the estimated payback.&#13;
12.    For the investments in (f), not even a grant of 100 percent would make the investments financially&#13;
attractive, but the likelihood of enterprises undertaking the investments during the grace period would&#13;
increase the larger the grant share. Investments in (f) are sufficiently distinct from investments in (b)-(e)&#13;
in terms of technology and therefore potential payback or lack thereof. Thus negligible transparency is&#13;
lost if the grant share for investments in (f) differs from grant share for investments in (b)-(e).&#13;
13.   In summary, grants will be awarded for qualifying investments as follows:&#13;
Payback period (yrs)                      Grant share of investment cost&#13;
0-2                                           0%&#13;
&gt;2                                           20 %&#13;

POLLUTION ABATEMENT PROJECT&#13;
APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS.&#13;
1.    Following is the approval process provided for screening, evaluating and monitoring the&#13;
environmental investments. Table I provides the proposed financing decision flow.&#13;
2.    Sub-Project Identification. Projects will be identified by the individual plants, by organizations&#13;
such as EEAA and donor agencies, and by recommendations by participating banks to their customers.&#13;
The PIU may provide technical assistance to the plant to identify environmental opportunities and develop&#13;
a pre-feasibility assessment and or an environmental audit. The plant and its participating bank will&#13;
develop a loan/grant proposal that will describe the project, its capital and operating costs, its&#13;
environmental benefits, its expected financial payback (if any), and the requested financing package. The&#13;
participating bank will determine if the client is credit worthy, whether the plant has reached the $5&#13;
million funding ceiling, and on a preliminary basis whether the proposed investment meets the project&#13;
technical eligibility criteria in para 2.13. This package will be submitted to the PIU by the participating&#13;
bank.&#13;
3.    Sub-Project Evaluation and Approval. The PIU will evaluate the technical merits of the&#13;
proposal using internal resources or local and international consultants paid for by funds available in the&#13;
first project component. This evaluation will verify the estimated costs and benefits, and determine the&#13;
grant portion of the package from the expected simple payback period (i.e., ignoring tax and costs of&#13;
capital impacts on cash flows) of the investment. The grant portion will be 20% of the total package if&#13;
the simple pay back exceeds 2 years. No grant will be provided for sub-projects with simple pay back is&#13;
two years or less.&#13;
4.    If a loan/grant request consists of several sub-investments having different payback, a grant&#13;
amount will be calculated for each sub-investment based on its simple payback. These amounts will be&#13;
added together to determine the allowed grant amount for the entire request.&#13;
5.    If the requested package is less than US$2 million, the PIU would recommend it to the&#13;
participating bank and the Credit and Grant Facilities may disburse the funds to the participating bank&#13;
immediately. If, the requested package is between US$ 2.0 million and US$ 5.0 million, it must be&#13;
reviewed by the Steering Committee. In exceptional circumstances when the requested package exceeds&#13;
US$ 5.0 million, the SC should consult with the World Bank. The SC will also review all PIJ financing&#13;
approvals by the participating banks on a regular basis.&#13;
6.    Sub-Project Monitoring. The enterprise will sign an sub-project grant agreement with EEAA,&#13;
which will be attached to the sub-loan agreement specifying its responsibilities. These will include: (a)&#13;
the terms and conditions for the installation and operation of the funded equipment; (b) the measures to&#13;
be taken for protecting the workers' health and safety, and provision of actual operating data. The PIU&#13;
will monitor compliance with this agreement. If an enterprise does not comply with the agreement, the&#13;
grant will be converted to a loan at current market rates, and the proceeds of this loan will be placed in&#13;
the Grant Facility.&#13;

ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
1.     4ost environmental benefits, and particularly those related to human health impacts, can not be&#13;
subjected to a benefit-cost analysis as functional relationships between health impacts and reductions in&#13;
various ptvllutants are not yet adequately determined. However, functional relationships have been&#13;
relatively N ell established for total suspended particulates (TSP) and lead. A benefit-cost analysis was&#13;
therefore uniertaken for the sub-projects in the pre-screened pipeline which would reduce TSP and lead&#13;
and could be financed under the PAF:&#13;
Sub-pi ,ject 1: Installation of a new lead smelting process to reduce lead emissions in Helwan.&#13;
Sub-prdiect 2: Installation of air filters to reduce particulate emissions in Shubra El Kheima.&#13;
Sub-pro%xt 3: Installation of air filters to reduce particulate emissions in Helwan.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;

The corresponding ERRs are 30-50 percent, 33-70 lercent and 18-43 percent for the three sub-projects.&#13;
4 Sub-project 3 includes two large and two small investnents among which the enterprise can select and submit&#13;
financing proposal.&#13;
Low and high estimate of health benefits and economic NPV is based on: estimated range of emissions&#13;
reductions for sub-project l; and estimated range for valuation of premature mortality from TSP pollution for&#13;
sub-project 2 and 3.&#13;

3.    Benefits and Costs: A 20 percent price/physical contingency is included in the investment cost&#13;
of the sub-projects. There are financial benefits only for sub-project 1. Financial benefits are not adjusted&#13;
for other than taxes and health benefits to arrive at economic benefits. The main financial benefits in&#13;
sub-project 1 are material (lead) and energy savings. Lead is a traded commodity and domestic wholesale&#13;
prices reasonably well reflect CIF import prices adjusted for taxes and duties. Energy prices have in&#13;
recent years raised to near international levels and/or long run marginal cost of supply. Insofar as some&#13;
energy pr.ces are below opportunity cost, the economic benefits in sub-project I are understated.&#13;
4.     The estimated health benefits are associated with a substantial degree of uncertainty.  A&#13;
conservative approach to most key parameter values has therefore been applied in order to not overstate&#13;
estimated health benefits vis-a-vis these parameters. Key parameters are:&#13;
(a)    dose response coefficients (the functional relationship between pollution exposure and&#13;
health impacts);&#13;
(b)    exposure to pollution from industrial sources addressed by the sub-projects;&#13;
(c)    monetary valuation of health impacts; and&#13;
(d)    emissions reductions resulting from the sub-project investments.&#13;
5.     Dose Response Coefficients: The dose response coefficients applied are the central estimates&#13;
from a series of epidemiological studies in the United States and Europe summarized in the World Bank's&#13;
Policy Research Working Paper No. 1301 (1994) by Dr. Bart Ostro at the California Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency. Dose responses in Egypt could be substantially different depending upon factors such&#13;
as time spent indoor versus outdoor, indoor air protection from outdoor pollution, general health status,&#13;
and behavioral characteristics such as smoking habits. A study on health impacts from particulate&#13;
pollution (TSP) in Santiago estimated dose response coefficients at very similar levels to the central&#13;
estimate presented in the World Bank paper.&#13;
6.     Exposure to Lead: The source of lead emissions addressed by sub-project 1 is not located in the&#13;
center of Cairo. The number of people exposed to a ton of lead emissions from this source is likely&#13;
substantially less than the number exposed to a ton of lead emissions from road vehicles throughout Cairo,&#13;
given that the population density around the sub-project I location is lower than the average for Cairo.&#13;
Estimated impacts per ton of lead emissions are therefore adjusted downward by a factor of ten relative&#13;
to the average estimated impact per ton of lead in Cairo. This is likely to under estimate the exposure&#13;
and health impacts, but is applied in order to arrive at a conservative estimate.&#13;
7.    Exposure to TSP: The sources of TSP emissions addressed by sub-project 2 and 3 are also&#13;
located at some distance from the center of Cairo. However, most of TSP emissions in Greater Cairo are&#13;
from sources at similar distances, and are disbursed over large areas, causing an air concentration level&#13;
of TSP at several times higher than WHO guidelines in most of Greater Cairo. Thus, emissions from the&#13;
sources addressed by sub-project 2 and 3 can be expected to have similar impact as emissions from most&#13;
other major sources. Health impacts per ton of TSP emissions have not been estimated for Cairo.&#13;
Estimates for Tehran in Iran has been applied given that Cairo and Tehran exhibit similar characteristics&#13;
of pollution sources and exposed populations. On the one hand, this could understate the estimate for&#13;
Cairo because Cairo has a higher population density than Tehran, and therefore the total health impacts&#13;
per ton of TSP emissions could be higher in Cairo. On the other hand, the estimate for Cairo could be&#13;
overstated because of inversion factors in Tehran which would tend to exacerbate health impacts per ton&#13;
of emissions.&#13;
&#13;

8.    Monetary Valuation of Lead Impacts: The key parameter associated with valuation of lead&#13;
impacts is the economic cost of neurophysiological impairment in children resulting in lower intelligence&#13;
and subsequently lower educational performance and future income potential. Estimated losses in future&#13;
income in the United States have been adjusted by the average income differential between the United&#13;
States and Egypt. Insofar as urban/rural income disparities in Egypt are larger than in the United States,&#13;
the estimated income loss for Egypt is understated.&#13;
9.    Monetary Valuation of TSP Impacts: The key parameter associated with valuation of TSP&#13;
impacts is the valuation of premature mortality, which tends to outweigh the cost of morbidity. Valuation&#13;
of premature mortality is normally the statistical value of life, which is based on the willingness of an&#13;
individual to pay for a reduction in the probability of death (and has nothing to do with the ethical value&#13;
of a human life). Estimates of the statistical value of life most often fall in the range of US$2-8 million&#13;
in the United States with a central estimate of about US$4 million. The US Environmental Protection&#13;
Agency normally apply a value of US$5-6 million. Caution must be taken, however, in applying these&#13;
values to the loss of a life due to TSP pollution. The estimated range is for individuals in their prime age&#13;
that can expect to live another 30-50 years. Most individuals that die from TSP pollution are likely to&#13;
have less than average good health and lower remaining life expectancy. A survey of monetary values&#13;
of a statistical life by age group indicates a 25 percent lower value for individuals above the age of 65&#13;
relative to individuals below the age of 65. This would suggest a central estimate of US$3 million for&#13;
individuals above the age of 65, which group may be more likely to die from TSP pollution. A&#13;
conservative value of US$1 million has been applied here for the "low" estimate, while US$3 million has&#13;
been applied for the "high" estimate. The figures have been adjusted by the average income differential&#13;
between Egypt and the United States, i.e. to US$25,000 and US$75,000.&#13;
10.   Emissions Reductions: Emissions reductions expected by the investments in the sub-projects have&#13;
been estimated based on on-site inspections, emissions monitoring, technical specifications of technology&#13;
to be installed, and assumptions about operating efficiency of these technologies. Emissions reductions&#13;
could be overstated, but there is limited basis for specifying a lower and higher range other than for sub-&#13;
project 1. Conservative benefit estimates have rather been arrived at by conservative valuation of the&#13;
healith benefits of emissions reductions.&#13;
11.   Sensitivity analysis: A sensitivity analysis is presented in Table 2 for the most critical parameter&#13;
values. The baseline values were applied to estimate the economic net present values and economic rates&#13;
of return presented in Table I for the three sub-projects. The ranges of baseline values in Table 2 are&#13;
estimated based on the discussion in the preceding paragraphs. The switching values fall within all&#13;
reasonable confidence intervals. Moreover, the benefits of large emissions reductions of volatile organic&#13;
compounds (VOCs) in sub-project 3, which in this case are considered carcinogenic, are not estimated.&#13;
Long term health impacts of TSP are also not included in sub-project 2 and 3 benefits, as these impacts&#13;
are generally not accounted for in the dose response estimates applied.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Pollution Abatement Project's
            broad objective is to assist the government of Egypt (GOE)
            in reducing industrial pollution causing adverse health
            effects and/or ecological degradation. Its specific
            objectives are to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement
            capabilities of the environmental institutions and establish
            technical and financial mechanisms for supporting pollution
            abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and the
            Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia. The project will
            consist of two main components: 1) a technical and
            institutional support component which includes: (a)
            strengthening of the capacity of the Egyptian Environment
            Affairs Agency (EEAA) branches and Governorates'
            Environment Management Units (EMUs); (b) development of
            Pollution Abatement Action Plans (PAAPs); (c) support for
            Environmental Audit Programs; and (d) promotion of awareness
            and Media Education Programs; and 2) a pollution abatement
            investment component.
