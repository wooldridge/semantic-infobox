CHAImIAN:     (Sounds gavel)      The first item is approval of the minutes of the last&#13;
(Black)&#13;
              meeting, the 197th meeting.      If there are no corrections, they stand&#13;
&#13;
              adopted.&#13;
&#13;
              :;: would like to announce to the Board that we have been informed by the&#13;
&#13;
              British Government that Sir Ern9st Rowe-Dutton has been appointed Executive&#13;
&#13;
              Director for the United Kingdom to take the place of Sir Gordon L1unro.&#13;
&#13;
              Sir Ernest will arrive at the Bank some time next week.&#13;
&#13;
              You have on the agenda today a discussion of the Committeefs report on&#13;
&#13;
              ir.terpretation of Article VII, Section 7.      That discussion has been deferred&#13;
&#13;
              until the next meeting of the Directors.&#13;
&#13;
              Iou have had a memorandum from Professor Varvaressos on the         F.A~O.   proposal&#13;
&#13;
              about an international     commQd~ties   clearine house.    We have had the opportunity&#13;
&#13;
              on several occasions to express privately the opinions of the people in the&#13;
&#13;
               Bank about the doubts and misgivings on this proposal.         I feel that, since&#13;
&#13;
               the Ba"k is not directly concerned in this matter, it would be better for&#13;
&#13;
               the Bank not to take the initiative in stating officially its opinion on&#13;
&#13;
               these proposals and, from the information I have received,' there is very&#13;
&#13;
               little chance that this proposal will go through aJ'\Ylf8.Y.     Unless there is&#13;
&#13;
               some   disagree~ent   on the Board, I think the attitude of the Bank should be&#13;
&#13;
               that we do nothing about it, unless we are asked and I do not think we will be.&#13;
&#13;
               Is there aqy discussion of this matter?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:      I did not hear exactly what you propose - that the Bank should not take any&#13;
&#13;
               initiative?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:      That is right.     I think perhaps the whole question is rather academic.&#13;
&#13;
               No one thinks it will go through anyway.       In   ~   own opinion, there are quite&#13;
               a few flaws in this proposal.      I do not see any reason for us to get into&#13;
               it unless the Directors feel differently.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
rlOPPJWOT :     On this special subject, I find that before receiving this rather interesting&#13;
&#13;
                paper, sometime ago the Economic Department gave us some special studies&#13;
&#13;
                on commodities on fats ard oils.       The main point T.hich is taken by both&#13;
&#13;
                F.A.O. and Professor Varvaressos relates to the trend in commodity prices.&#13;
&#13;
                I think that from the broader point of view of the Bank it is an extremely&#13;
&#13;
                important point because most of tlte, or many of the so-called urderdeveloped&#13;
&#13;
                countries are, in fact, agricultural countries.       Would it be possible that,&#13;
&#13;
                from time to time, the Economic Department or sane other department give&#13;
&#13;
                us a general study on connnodi ties, on tr.e price trends, production, etc.,&#13;
&#13;
                and maybe also on a few general raw materials like copper, tin, etc.?&#13;
&#13;
                Some of the price trends are not so important but non-ferrous metals are&#13;
&#13;
                important.     I think it would enable us to broaden our views and judge the&#13;
&#13;
                general situation of many underdeveloped countries better.        I do not think&#13;
&#13;
                that angle of the question is taken either by F.A.O. or by Professor&#13;
&#13;
                Varvaressos.&#13;
&#13;
                Do you think, Mr. Chairman, we could have a study from time to time?&#13;
&#13;
CHA IRII.AN :   Mr. Ilist, did you hear this question?&#13;
&#13;
RIST:           Very recently,    ~~.   Chairman, the Canadian Executive Director asked us to&#13;
&#13;
                make a study about the effects of devaluation on prices of raw materials.&#13;
&#13;
                This study is in process.       There are two aspects:   movements of prices&#13;
&#13;
                tilemselves and repercussions on prices of raw materials produced especially&#13;
&#13;
                in underdeveloped countries.       This study is now in process and I do think&#13;
&#13;
                that within a very few weeks you will have at least a summary account of&#13;
&#13;
                our conclusions.        So far as commodities generally are concerned, our&#13;
&#13;
                 studies are proceeding at irregular intervals.       There ndgh t be a further&#13;
&#13;
                 approach, either making a beneral study of commodities, or commodity by&#13;
&#13;
                 commodity.    I am thinking especially of the case of coffee which has&#13;
&#13;
                 undergone a tremendous rise over recent weeks.       In fact, price rises in&#13;
&#13;
                 a number of Latin American countries are very considerable.        I intend to&#13;
&#13;
                 circulate a study on the effect of price rises of coffee very shortly.&#13;
&amp;#12;BRESC lAIH :   'Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Mr. Rist a question in this connection.&#13;
&#13;
               I heard a few days ago from a member of the International Monetary Fund&#13;
&#13;
               that an inquirJ of exactly the kind having the pr0hlem of ascertaining the&#13;
&#13;
               consequences of the devaluation on the pI'ices of raw materials is being&#13;
&#13;
               no)'; conducted by the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
               Is this true, are the two cases exactly parallel to each other or are they&#13;
&#13;
               coordinated with each other, keeping in touch with the staff?&#13;
&#13;
RIST:          They are both parallel and interlocked.      We have worked with the Fund on&#13;
&#13;
               that for recent weeks and it so happens that the direction of the two studies&#13;
&#13;
               taken are not comparable.      In fact, only the basic study is in connnon.&#13;
&#13;
               The practical conclusions both institutions made are the same and will tally.&#13;
&#13;
               The methods are not always exactly the same and perhaps our approach is a&#13;
&#13;
               little more, shall I say, "down-to-earth" and practical.       It is the effect&#13;
&#13;
               on the balance of payments over a long period that we are more interested&#13;
&#13;
               in and the Fund being more interested in the immediate reaction on the&#13;
&#13;
               exchange situation in various countries.      However, you can say the two&#13;
&#13;
               studies are working together.&#13;
&#13;
TANSLEY:       Mr. President, as regards Mr. Rist's last comments, there are two things:&#13;
               firstly, the Bank is not just interested in long-term proposals; equally&#13;
&#13;
               the Fund is not interested only in short-term proposals.       Perhaps he did&#13;
&#13;
               not mean quite that.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       In connection with the F.A.O. meeting, I saw briefly this morning a study&#13;
&#13;
               made by F.A.O. of capital needs of the world and I think they estimated&#13;
&#13;
                the needs of local and foreign exchange funds is about $43 billion a year.&#13;
&#13;
                They feel the present agencies are somewhat inadequate for those needs&#13;
&#13;
                and they have various suggestions as to what should be done.      I did not&#13;
&#13;
                have a chance to read it but members of the Board might be interested.         It&#13;
&#13;
                is rather discouraging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2)00 -&#13;
&amp;#12; fl.RANSKI:   I think I am fully in agreement with Professor Varvaressos if I say that if&#13;
&#13;
              foodstuffs would be sold by the Clearing House against local currency, and&#13;
&#13;
              the proceeds from these sales would be used f or local investments - that&#13;
              would be in effect equivalent to the granting of loans by the I.B.R.D. for&#13;
&#13;
              internal spending.    It makes no difference whether the local currency prQceeds&#13;
&#13;
              are being obtained by selling dollars to the Central Bank, or by selling&#13;
&#13;
              imported commodities on the local market.        The Bank can make loans for local&#13;
&#13;
              spending under the Articles of Agreement in exceptional circumstances.        It&#13;
&#13;
              would be inconsistent to allow the proposed International Commodities&#13;
&#13;
              Clearing House to make such loans if the Bank should continue its negative&#13;
&#13;
              attitude towards them in its own sphere of activity.&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Any other discussion?&#13;
              Mr. Iliff, will you give us the present position of our loan applications.&#13;
              After that, I think you want to talk about the Mexican Light and Power&#13;
&#13;
              situation.&#13;
ILIFF:        Gentlemen, the President has asked me this morning to report to the Board&#13;
&#13;
              the present situation of our negotiations with regard to the credits&#13;
&#13;
              to the Mexican Light and Power.    The Board will remember that under the&#13;
&#13;
              interim credit of $10 million, we fixed a closing date of December 1st, am&#13;
&#13;
              a maturity date of December 31, 1949.     That was done on the assumption that&#13;
&#13;
              the capital reorganization of the Mexican Light and Power would be completed&#13;
&#13;
              during this year, and that having been done, it was the intention that a long&#13;
&#13;
              term credit of $26 million could be made directly to the Company, out of&#13;
&#13;
              "Which the $10 million of the short term credit could be refunded and the&#13;
&#13;
              balance made available for the    Compa~'s      expansion program over the next&#13;
&#13;
              two or three years.     If that time-table had been realized, the maturity of&#13;
&#13;
              the first mortgage bonds of the Company on February 1, 1950 would have been&#13;
&#13;
              :forestalled.   But owing to the delay in fixing the power rates, it will not&#13;
&#13;
              be possible for the Company to complete the reorganization plan until the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 . - 2)01 -&#13;
&amp;#12;ILIFF:   end of Mayor June, 1950.   Accordingly, the Company has applied to the&#13;
 mt'd)&#13;
         Mexican authorities for an extension of the maturity and closing date&#13;
&#13;
         of the interim loan and the Company has also called meet ings to be held&#13;
&#13;
         in January 1950 of the first mortgage bond holders, in order to ask for&#13;
&#13;
         an extension of these maturities for long enough to allow the proposed&#13;
&#13;
         reorganization plan to be considered by meetings of the various groups of&#13;
&#13;
         security-holders.   The Nacional Financiera and the Federal Power Commission&#13;
&#13;
         (who are co-borrowers under the loan agreement) propose in tur.n to ask the&#13;
&#13;
         Bank to extend the maturity and closing date of the interim loan.       The&#13;
&#13;
         President will, therefore, shortly approach the Board to seek approval for&#13;
&#13;
         an unconditional extension of the maturity date until January 31, 1950, so&#13;
&#13;
         as to tide over the contemplated meetings of the first mortgage bond holders.&#13;
&#13;
         He will also propose a further extension of the interim credit until July 31,&#13;
&#13;
         1950 conditional on the granting of a similar extension by the first mortgage&#13;
&#13;
         bonds.   In any case the Bank will have to extend the closing date, as distinct&#13;
&#13;
         from the mat uri ty date of the interim loan.    Disbursements on that interim&#13;
&#13;
         credit to date are $4.1 million as compared with $2.5 million on the Comision&#13;
&#13;
         loan.&#13;
&#13;
         The President also suggested I ought to tell the Board the extent to which&#13;
&#13;
         the reorganization proposals of the Company, as circulated to the Board&#13;
&#13;
         in the draft explanatory circular have been varied in consequence of certain&#13;
&#13;
         events which have taken place since.&#13;
&#13;
         The Board will remember the senior securities involved in the reorganization&#13;
&#13;
         were the first mortgage issues of Â»ex-Light and Mex-electric.       Secondly,&#13;
&#13;
         the first mortgage issue of Pachuca Light and Power and thirdly, the second&#13;
&#13;
         Mortgage issue of the 14exlight Company.     The First Mortgage Bonds of&#13;
&#13;
         llexlight and Mexelectric are expressed in Canadian dollars.     The original&#13;
&#13;
         plan for the conversion of these bonds was that they should be exchanged&#13;
&#13;
         for U.S. dollar bonds, dollar for dollar.       At the time this plan was made,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           - 2302 -&#13;
&amp;#12;  LIFF:    the U.S. and Canadian dollar      w~    at parity with one another.    The Pachuca&#13;
\~ont'd)&#13;
           securities are expressed in sterling, but payable in Canadian dollars at&#13;
&#13;
           the fixed rate of $4.86 2/3 to     *.     The original plan was that these&#13;
&#13;
           securities be converted into U.S. dollar securities, and that the conversion&#13;
&#13;
           should take place by going first into Canadian dollars at the 4.86 rate&#13;
&#13;
           and then fran Canadian to U.S. dollars at par.           The second mortgage borda&#13;
&#13;
           are a sterling issue, and the original plan was they should be depressed&#13;
&#13;
           to a   5%   cumulative income debenture stock, expressed in U.S. dollars, and&#13;
&#13;
           that conversion should be carried out on the basis that one pound sterling&#13;
&#13;
           equals U.S. $4.0).     That was all right, and everyone was agreeable to&#13;
&#13;
           carrying out the plan on that baSis, and then suddenly we were faced with&#13;
&#13;
           devaluation.     The company came to us with an amended proposal, which we&#13;
&#13;
           looked at and which we did not like.         It seemed to us that the amendments which&#13;
&#13;
           the Company had introduced into their proposals for conversion come to nothing&#13;
           more than an attempt to cushion the effect of devaluation on the security&#13;
&#13;
           holders.      We were asked for our view, and not only that, we were asked to&#13;
&#13;
           support the company's proposals.         The position we took was that, if we were&#13;
&#13;
           asked to what extent devaluation ought to be taken into account, our answer&#13;
&#13;
           could only be that it must be fully taken into account, and we were not&#13;
           prepared to support any other proposal.            We informed the Company, however,&#13;
&#13;
           that   8S   they themselves had to obtain the approval of the lIexican authorities&#13;
&#13;
           :for the exchange of these securities, the best course would be to try their&#13;
&#13;
           own luck with the     ~exicans.   We indicated there might perhaps be some differencE&#13;
&#13;
           between the arrangements the Bank would support, ani the arrangements which the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank would acquiesce in.      The Company took the proposals to the J4exicans, and&#13;
&#13;
           we had quite lengthy discussions on this issue when Mr. Buchanan and myself&#13;
&#13;
           were in Mexico City.      We have finally intimated to the Company and to the&#13;
&#13;
           Mexican authorities that     we   are prepared to recommend to our Board that&#13;
&#13;
           the Bank should accept an amendment in the original plan, so as to provide&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 2303 -&#13;
&amp;#12;ILIFF:       for arrangements which I will outline briefly now.        So far as the existing&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
             Mexlight and Mexeleceric first mortgage bonds are concerned, we agree&#13;
             these should be converted into U.S. dollar securities at par.        The reasons&#13;
&#13;
             for this is that it has been the practice of the Company over many years            J&#13;
             to pay interest on those bonds in U.S. dollars, and we are advised there is&#13;
&#13;
             a grave risk of litigation with the conseq.! ent risk that the whole plan on&#13;
&#13;
             reorganizations might be held up if any variation is introduced into that&#13;
&#13;
             arrangement.     Accordingly both the Bank and the Mexican authorities have&#13;
&#13;
             acquiesced in that arrangement.        So far as the Pachuca first mortgage bonds&#13;
&#13;
             are concerned, they would be converted into U.S. dollar securities going&#13;
&#13;
             first into Canadian dollars at the guaranteed rate of $4.86 to ., and then&#13;
&#13;
             into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange, that is to say, the&#13;
&#13;
             90 cent Canadian dollar.       But up to the end of 1950, the holder of Pachuca&#13;
&#13;
             bonds would have the right to ask for a Canadian dollar security i f he so&#13;
&#13;
             wishes.     He has until the end of 1950 to exercise that right.     His Canadian&#13;
&#13;
             dollar security would be issued on the basis of the existing rate for the&#13;
&#13;
             Canadian dollar.     So far as the second mortgage bonds are concerned, we&#13;
&#13;
             have agreed that they should be converted into a U.S. dollar security at&#13;
&#13;
             the $2.80 rate.     I think I made it clear that they were to be depressed&#13;
&#13;
             to income debenture stock.       We have agreed however, and the Mexican&#13;
&#13;
             authon ties also have agreed, that the rate of interest, ongi nally        C ontempla ted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             at   5%,   should be raised   to5!%.   That is the new plan so far as securities&#13;
&#13;
             are concerned.&#13;
&#13;
 TANSLE!:    There is only one request      to   make, and that is that Mr. Iliff's notes should&#13;
&#13;
             be circulated.     Obviously, they are rather difficult to follow, with all this&#13;
&#13;
             technical information.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:   We shall be glad to do that.        There is no action required here, it it just&#13;
&#13;
             for your information.&#13;
&#13;
 ILIFF:      I think it was your intention anyway, sir, that when we asked the Board to&#13;
&#13;
             gi ve approval, to circulate too new set up.&#13;
 BARANSKI:   I would ask for an explanation of the legal character of the income        d:'~iBture&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:       stocks as Uley differ from the bonds.      You say they will be depressed in&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
                status, so that   stat~s   must be inferior.   What are the legal features?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       The income debenture bond is one the companies ought to pay income on.&#13;
&#13;
BAR~NSKI    :   That is the kind of bond not secured by the market?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRl'JAN:     It is pretty close to preferred stock.&#13;
&#13;
I3ARA t-BKI :   More than preferred stock, but if the income is not sufficient?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIHMAN:       They do not have to pay.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:       No right to get interest?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:       That is right.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          What is the risk of litigation?      Mr. Iliff said there was a risk of&#13;
&#13;
                litigation, but I cannot quite see the danger.&#13;
&#13;
SOMMERS :       That is a very complicated thing.      The oonds say paid in dollars, but they&#13;
&#13;
                do not say whether they are Canadian dollars or U.S. dollars.       That is the&#13;
&#13;
                whole story.     In case of one issue, bonds refer on their face to Canadian&#13;
&#13;
                dollars, and in the other case there is no such reference.       There has been&#13;
&#13;
                litigation on this subject before, ani a U.S. court has held as to principal&#13;
&#13;
                they are payable in Canadian dollars, but made no decision as to interest.&#13;
&#13;
                We think the legal situation is probably better for saying these bonds are&#13;
&#13;
                payable in Canadian dollars rather than U.S.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:          Now I see, there is a case for litigation.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENGr :      Just to clear my mind (stop me if I am mistaken), I think the plan of&#13;
&#13;
                reorganization was set up to take account of a certain set of rates, rates&#13;
&#13;
                for the setting of current, etc., which will not be the actual rate that&#13;
&#13;
                the Mexican Government is ready to grant to the companies.&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF:          No, I think the circular issued by the Company indicated a rate change they&#13;
&#13;
                have secured from the Mexican authorities.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPENGr:        So that these securities are only affected by changes in the currency rates&#13;
&#13;
                 and not by the fact that with different rates the financial organization&#13;
&#13;
                 has to be altered.    At one time we were told that the financial organization&#13;
                was to be modified because the rates could not be what was expected.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOOKER:           They did not set rates.&#13;
&#13;
                  That   v[as   something that happened last Spring, at the time we circulated&#13;
&#13;
                  some preliminary information as to the Plan.            Subsequently the rate nego-&#13;
&#13;
                  tiations in Mexico crystallized and the Company found out tbat it Vias to&#13;
&#13;
                  receive a lor:er rate of return than originally hoped for arc last June or&#13;
&#13;
                  last Jul!', they revised their Plan accordingly.           That is the Plan the Board&#13;
&#13;
                  got last Summer.       This new change has nothing to do with electrification&#13;
&#13;
                  rates, only rates of exchange.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPEr~CYI'   :   I know the present reorganization is with present rates.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAH:         This is merely a change in the terms of the exchange of bonds and we will&#13;
&#13;
                  sem to you right away the proposed changes of this reorganization plan.&#13;
&#13;
                  Are there any other questions?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:         Some bonds now expressed in sterling will now be expressed in dollars.               For&#13;
&#13;
                  what reason?&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF':           The Company1s orieinal approach was to tidy up the balance sheet, which&#13;
&#13;
                  had to show three different currencies.             They would prefer to have it&#13;
&#13;
                  expressed in one and they chose U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:         The balance sheet expressed in dollars?&#13;
                                   still&#13;
ILIFF:            I think it would/be expressed in Canadian dollars.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:            They will still have Canadian and U.S. dollars -             tidiness is relativel&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:         Any other questions?&#13;
&#13;
                   (To Mr. Iliff)      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                  Dr. Lauchlin Currie, who headed our mission to Colombia, has just returned&#13;
&#13;
                  and I have asked him to tell the Board about his trip.             Dr. Currie?&#13;
&#13;
CURRIE:            I think perhaps you gentlemen will be interested a little bit more in the&#13;
&#13;
                  basic idea of this mission than in Colombia itself.&#13;
&#13;
                   I speak subject to correction of the management of the Bank, but I can give&#13;
&#13;
                  you my impressions of the basic attitude behind the mission and the purpose&#13;
&#13;
                   it sought to serve when it took off last July.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       -   2':\06 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:     This mission to Colombia has differed from any other mission sent out by&#13;
(Cont Id)&#13;
            the Bank.    It was the first attempt at a comprehensive study of the whole&#13;
&#13;
            economy of a country.    lty term::; of reference were very broad- simply to&#13;
&#13;
            work out a sound plan of development to raise the standard of living in&#13;
&#13;
            Colombia - quite a bit of scope.&#13;
&#13;
            I assume that ti,e International Bank, like any bank, is interested in the&#13;
&#13;
            goodness of its loans from the point of view of repayment, but more than&#13;
&#13;
            that interested that its loans should accomplish the maximum amount of&#13;
&#13;
            assistance in aiding the development of an underdeveloped country.&#13;
&#13;
            The problem is to get maximum returns in that sense from the activities of&#13;
&#13;
            the Bank.    I tnink there is some feeling that a satisfactory answer to that&#13;
&#13;
            has not yet been worked out.    There are certain difficulties attached to&#13;
&#13;
            specific project loans, projects   W~10ut   relation to the overall requirements&#13;
&#13;
            of the country.    A project may be excellent in itself but other things being&#13;
&#13;
            done by the country may completely nullify or offset the good effects of it.&#13;
&#13;
            The chief thing, after all, in the development of underdeveloped countries&#13;
&#13;
            is What they do themselves - the utilization of their own resources, the&#13;
&#13;
            goodness of balance between various production factors, the organization&#13;
&#13;
            of production.    You cannot raise the standard of living simply by foreign&#13;
&#13;
            loans, good internal management is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
            There is nothing mysterious about this question of raising the standard of&#13;
&#13;
            living.     It goes back in the ultimate analysis to high productivity per&#13;
&#13;
            head - on goodness of balance of resources of land, climate, capital, man-&#13;
&#13;
            power, ani goodness with which these resources are organized.      I think it&#13;
&#13;
             is generally the experience, at least it is my own impression, that advice&#13;
&#13;
            alone is not sufficient.     Most urrlerdeveloped countries have received good&#13;
&#13;
            advice from technical missions but have not followed it so that that part&#13;
&#13;
             of the task of development has not yet been worked out satisfactorily.&#13;
&#13;
            We found in Colombia, for instance, a number of ,special missions who were&#13;
             not sufficiently integrated into the government machi,ne, so that their work&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:     did not result in adoption or implementation of the recommerrlations.       We&#13;
(Cont Id)&#13;
            found that an excellent railroad mission,      R~nt   to Colombia in 1946 by the&#13;
&#13;
            Institute of Inter-American Affairs, made several hundred specific recorn-&#13;
&#13;
            mendations but not one had been adopted.       I think that is partly because&#13;
&#13;
            they settled down at a rather low echelon and consequently no action was&#13;
&#13;
            taken on their recommendations.     Probably the solution is to couple aid&#13;
&#13;
            with advice, possibly making the aid conditional upon acceptance of all&#13;
&#13;
            or part of the advice or technical assistance.         That may have to be the&#13;
&#13;
            formula.&#13;
&#13;
            In this connection, I think that foreign missions, such as this one to&#13;
&#13;
            Colombia, perform a rather indispensable role.         In the first place, we&#13;
&#13;
            can make available the benefit of knovlledge of a rather advanced economy&#13;
&#13;
            and make that knowledge accessible to the particular country concerned.&#13;
&#13;
            Second, and perhaps of even greater significance, we do bring objectivity.&#13;
&#13;
            Third, local technicians have not such prestige and cannot speak with&#13;
&#13;
            authority and their words are not listened to.&#13;
&#13;
            The Colombian mission appeared to be an excellent test case ror this type&#13;
&#13;
            of approach.   Colombia has excellent resources that ha7e not been suffiCiently&#13;
&#13;
            developed and, in some cases, not even exploited.         It is an amazing country&#13;
&#13;
            from the point of view of diversity of agricultural production.         There is&#13;
&#13;
            greater di versi ty of agricultural production in this small country than&#13;
&#13;
            we have in the whole North American continent, because of dirferences in&#13;
&#13;
            altitude.   The growing season exterrls through twelve months of the year.&#13;
&#13;
            It has excellent agricultural land, perhaps not properly used.         There are&#13;
&#13;
            enormous forests not touched but are being burned off to clear land.            It is&#13;
&#13;
            tremendously rich in coal resources and it has in the past produced some-&#13;
&#13;
             thing like half a billion barrels of oil.       Oil production is still good&#13;
&#13;
            although prospects are not   50   good as they were a few years ago.&#13;
&#13;
             There is a highly educated upper class of lawyers, businessmen, etc., that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 2308 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:    could provide leadership.        It seemed an excellent country to study because&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           of all these advantages.        In addition it has a unique position in foreign&#13;
&#13;
           exchange.     Its terms of trade have improved compared with berore the war.&#13;
&#13;
           Despite all Ulese advantages it must be admitted that for the bulk of the&#13;
&#13;
           people the standard of living is very low.        People live mainly in the&#13;
&#13;
           count~r,    have   ve~J   little education, poor health, and a depressingly low&#13;
&#13;
           standard of living.&#13;
&#13;
           One other thing I Should mention.        They have had an orderly constitutional&#13;
&#13;
           goverment for the past fifty years with orderly changes of administration.&#13;
&#13;
           It seemed to be an excellent case to test out the new approach to the&#13;
&#13;
           problem of haw to assist in the development of a country.&#13;
&#13;
           In the organization of the mission itselr, I tl1ink we made some interesting&#13;
&#13;
           experiments.       For instance, since this was not a joint mission, we deviated&#13;
&#13;
           from the model of the Abbink Mission to Brazil, the responsibility for which&#13;
&#13;
           was shared jointly by the Brazilian and American Governments.           However,&#13;
&#13;
           there were disadvantages to this formula as it necessitated agreements as&#13;
&#13;
           you go along.       Instead of using a report as a basis for later discussion,&#13;
&#13;
           the discussion took pl2.ce before the report was submitted.         This militated&#13;
&#13;
           against the sharpness and clarity of approach.         Our   mission was joint in&#13;
&#13;
           the sense of sharing expenses.         The Bank took full responsibility for the&#13;
&#13;
           organization of the mission and the subsequent report and the Colombian&#13;
&#13;
           authorities collaborated in the sense of inviting it and paying its local&#13;
&#13;
           expenses.     So far as I know, this arrangement has worked out perfectly.&#13;
&#13;
           We could not have had greater cooperation from the Government and the&#13;
&#13;
           Banco de la Republica Relations were very happy.&#13;
&#13;
           One other departure in this mission lay in the association of other inter-&#13;
&#13;
           national agencies.         Although again the Bank took full responsibility,&#13;
&#13;
           nevertheless we did have our agricultural member nominated by LA.O.&#13;
&#13;
           They will have the benefit of this experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 2109 -&#13;
&amp;#12; CUR-HIE:   Our health and sanitation member was an Assistru1t Surgeon General of the&#13;
,Cont'd)&#13;
            United States Public Health Senrice, nominated by the Pan American SanitarJ&#13;
&#13;
            Bureau.   In addition, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau placed a staff&#13;
&#13;
            member at our disposal.&#13;
&#13;
            Our man on exchange rates and an international economic position of Colombia,&#13;
&#13;
            was ncminated by the Internati8nal Monetary Fund, and that arrangement seemed&#13;
&#13;
            to work out very happily.&#13;
&#13;
            The mission grew beyond expectations, because at one time or another we found&#13;
&#13;
            areas we had not anticipated that needed study, so I sent out calls for help,&#13;
&#13;
            and the Bank was good enough to supply additional people.&#13;
&#13;
            For instance, we found the air transport situation was rather critical and&#13;
&#13;
            required expert study, and we also found that the municipal picture was&#13;
&#13;
            very important.       There are 800 municipalities, and probably their capital&#13;
&#13;
            requirements should have fairly high p:-iority.        The municipalities need&#13;
&#13;
            IDru1y things; for instance, the provision of pure water is one 8f tile major&#13;
&#13;
            problems.   As a consequence of bad water and sanitation, there is very wide&#13;
&#13;
            prevalence of disease.      other needs are for power, sewers, slaughter houses,&#13;
&#13;
            streets, etc.     Another aspect requiring study was. the relation of the&#13;
&#13;
            municipalities to the departments or states and the central governments.&#13;
&#13;
            At one time or another we had about fourteen         diff~~ent   people on the mission.&#13;
&#13;
            It took about   3?a   months, an:! a good deal of our time was spent in constructin&#13;
&#13;
            basic statistical series      m ich   are needed for planning purposes.     lie&#13;
&#13;
            construc~ed   the national income,haw much national income is saved, i.e.&#13;
&#13;
            how much is available for cap i tal expendi tura, who saved it, what happens&#13;
&#13;
             to it, where does it go.      We made up a balance of payments and the sources&#13;
&#13;
             oB money supply.       We assembled basic data on housing and health.       We even&#13;
&#13;
             tried to get an idea of the traffic on the highways, which has never been&#13;
&#13;
             studied before, and is indispensable when you are planning new highways.&#13;
&#13;
             So I think the report, as well as the recommendations, will prove very&#13;
&#13;
            . helpful to Colombia.     We were assisted by some young economists in the&#13;
                                                  _   ?~'n   _&#13;
&amp;#12; CURRIE:       Banco de la Hepublica, and I think they are competent to improve upon&#13;
(Cont 'd)&#13;
               these economic series am cGntinue them.&#13;
&#13;
               l\'1:at remains to be done is rather formidable.       Vfe have divided the report&#13;
&#13;
               into two sections, too diagnosis, and then the prescription.            We wanted&#13;
&#13;
               to separate the diagnosis fram our prescription         S0   that other people can&#13;
&#13;
               give different prescriptions if they like.          In the positive part of the&#13;
&#13;
               program - the prescription - we are      tr~rin~   to do something ambitious and&#13;
&#13;
               to present a specific plan.       We have estimated vfhat the increase in&#13;
&#13;
               population Viill be by zones, by urban districts, and then tried to figure&#13;
&#13;
               out   ~tlat   increase in production will be necessary to look after the increase&#13;
&#13;
               in population plus some providing a rise in the standard of living in, say,&#13;
&#13;
               a period of five years, and have set specific goals for all agricultural&#13;
&#13;
               and industrial products, hOUSing, health,          sanitation~   education, etc. and&#13;
&#13;
               tried to determine     wl~t   is necessary to reach those goals in pesos and&#13;
&#13;
               dollars.        We did this not with the thought that anyone is going to take&#13;
&#13;
               this plan over as it is and carry it out, but with the idea that it is a&#13;
&#13;
               model, an example of what goals have to be achieved i f you want to bring&#13;
&#13;
               about a rise in the standard of living.&#13;
&#13;
                It was the original intention when I left that this plan should be submitted&#13;
&#13;
                to the Bank management, and would then be taken up with the Colombian&#13;
&#13;
                authorities and used as a basis for discussion as to what might be worked&#13;
&#13;
                out.    No advance commitments were made.     However, the thought was that&#13;
&#13;
                i f agreement could be worked the Bank would be prepared to finance and&#13;
&#13;
                underwrite part of it, part would be left to foreign private investment&#13;
&#13;
                and the bulk would be undertaken by Colombia.          It was also originally&#13;
&#13;
                intended that if the report did not do discredit on the Bank, it should be&#13;
&#13;
                published.&#13;
 HOPPENaI':Â·    I did not quite hear your last sentence.&#13;
&#13;
  CURRIE:       It was intended that i f the report did not do discredit on the Dank, it&#13;
                should be published.      Unfortunately, the political situation deteriorated&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:    while we were there, and it is in a    \'8ry   confused and chaotic condition&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           at the moment.     I am not sure how it will turn out, and the prospects of&#13;
&#13;
           going ahead in a big way are perhaps not as favorable as they were when&#13;
&#13;
           we left here, but still the study    ~~ll   be of considerable value to&#13;
&#13;
           Colombia, regardless of .vhether an agreement is reached with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           It will be of enourmous value for Colombia first, because it is the only&#13;
&#13;
           comprehensive economic study that has ever been made of the country and&#13;
&#13;
           will serve as a basis for discussion of economic issues.        It contains a&#13;
&#13;
           good deal of information which I do not think they have had before, and&#13;
&#13;
           from   tr~t   point of view should prove highly useful.    From the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
           point of view, it was an interesting experiment in seeing what might be&#13;
&#13;
           done in the line of an overall plan in which the Bank might participate -&#13;
&#13;
           what really are the things necessary to be done by a country to bring&#13;
&#13;
           about a rise in the starrlard of living in a not too distant period.           It&#13;
&#13;
           will be interesting for other countries in similar conditions, for under-&#13;
&#13;
           developed countries have very common problems, and may be of interest&#13;
&#13;
           and help in suggesting the kind of studies and help and analysis which&#13;
&#13;
           might be undertaken by them.&#13;
&#13;
            In many of the relatively underdeveloped countries, you have the same&#13;
&#13;
           problems.      A large part of the population is in ill-health, is uneducated,&#13;
&#13;
            and has a low standard of living.     There is the same   p~oblem   of&#13;
&#13;
           organization.      There is the same problem of a lack of basic information&#13;
&#13;
            and knowing what is available in order to decide how it might be&#13;
&#13;
           allocated.      There is another problem not yet serious in Colombia but&#13;
&#13;
            beginning to loom on the horizon - the problem of population.            There is&#13;
&#13;
            a super-aburrlance of workers in relation to capital and good arable land.&#13;
&#13;
            That is a problem that is looming.     The population is increasing at a rate&#13;
&#13;
            of 2% per annum, ,and we found that a substantial increase in production is&#13;
&#13;
            necessary to provide for this increase as well as to provide a rise in&#13;
            the standard of living of the existing population.         If the various&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:       sanitary measures are adopted that we will recollI!!lend, the population&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
              will increase still more rapidly.    In other   ),/OrdS,   I:lany muntries have&#13;
&#13;
              the same general problems so that I hope the Report, when completed,&#13;
&#13;
              will be generally useful.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:     Thank you very much.   Are there any questions?&#13;
&#13;
 BRESCIANI:   I have noticed with special interest for me, personally, the point in&#13;
&#13;
              your report that you were able to calculate the national income of the&#13;
&#13;
              country.   I am ver.! interested in this problem, as the san:e problem presents&#13;
&#13;
              itself for Italy, and up to now we do not have a really trustworthy figure&#13;
&#13;
              as to what the national income is.    There are some things of broad&#13;
&#13;
              statistical basis such as in U.S. that are completely lacking in Italy.&#13;
&#13;
              Vie have estimates made by going to private statistics, and for myself I&#13;
&#13;
              have very little confidence in these estimates.        Therefore, I was very&#13;
&#13;
              interested in knowing how you have concluded in such a short time, the&#13;
&#13;
              national income of Colombia, and I should like to ask you whether you&#13;
&#13;
              already had sufficient statistical basis for these calculations obtainable&#13;
&#13;
              in Colombia, and i f not, by what method you could arrive at this.&#13;
&#13;
 CURUIE:      That is a very good point.   What we found was plenty of statistics but&#13;
&#13;
              unfortunately not statistics that had been worked over, revised and put&#13;
&#13;
              in the form suitable for our purposes.      Unfortunately, Colombia has very&#13;
&#13;
              few economists and these as yet have not very high status.           Of these&#13;
&#13;
              economists some have been trained in the literary tradition and can write&#13;
&#13;
              whole books on systems and ideas without mentioning a statistic.           There&#13;
&#13;
               are only two or three that have been trained in the newer quantitative&#13;
&#13;
               analytical approach and can rarely hanne such things as national income&#13;
&#13;
               complications.   In some cases, of course, the basic data themselves were&#13;
&#13;
               missing and in these cases we had to rely on our ingenuity in using what&#13;
&#13;
              was available to piece out a picture.       For example, in the course of trying&#13;
&#13;
               to get some information on traffic flows, we discovered that Colombia is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 2313 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CURRIE:       not one but really four economic countries.     Each one of these four zones&#13;
(Contrd)&#13;
              is almost self-sufficient and they carry on something analaEous to illter-&#13;
&#13;
              national trade with each other on a few items such as salt, sugar,&#13;
&#13;
              petroleum and imported goods.&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:    May I add to what Mr. Bresciani said, that in a paper Gistributed by the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank on August 11, there is a very good analysis of the Colombian mission.&#13;
&#13;
 BRESCIANI:   I did not get it.&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:    I recoIinnend that you get i t - it is very good.&#13;
&#13;
 CURRIE :     I am very glad you raised that point.     We were helped considerably by the&#13;
&#13;
              preparatory work carried on by the Bank's Economic Division.       Without&#13;
&#13;
              this work, our stay in Colombia would have had to have been much longer.&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:    The question about coal.     You mention coal reserves are substantial.      There&#13;
&#13;
              must be some mistake.    Says here the reserves are estimated at       tons of&#13;
&#13;
               coal, which is ridiculously low.    Maybe   millions have been confused with&#13;
&#13;
               billions 1&#13;
&#13;
 CURRIE :     That is probably it.&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:    Twenty-five million tons annually produced by a country would be a very&#13;
&#13;
              low production.&#13;
&#13;
 CURRIE:       As a matter of fact, there has recently been discovered through the operation&#13;
               of one of the oil companies&#13;
              /a large coal deposit on the Carribean coast with proven reserves of 80,000,00&#13;
&#13;
              tons of Ylhat looks to be high grade coal suitable for export.&#13;
&#13;
  BARANSKI:    Probably it is a mistake here.&#13;
&#13;
 CURnIE:       Production of oil from tile-beginning has been around half a million barrels.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIR.MAN:   . What will happen when Standard Oil pulls out of there?&#13;
&#13;
 CURr1IE:      They are not pulling.     I understand their concession expires in 1951 and&#13;
&#13;
               they are carrying on negotiations on the basis of which they will continue&#13;
&#13;
               operations in Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:     The paper this morning said they are pulling out.&#13;
&#13;
 CURRIE:       I think that what is really happening is some high-powered negotiations&#13;
               as the basis on which they will continue.     The Colombian Congress passed&#13;
&amp;#12;CU illiIE:   a law providing for a new comparrJ with 52% Goverrnnent .:)wnership.      This js&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
             unsatisfact.:)ry to Standard a.lthoug!1 J: believe they would continue vii th&#13;
&#13;
             their 50% arrangement or a good managem,,"nt contract.        They have a larger&#13;
&#13;
             position in the whole petroleum marketing system in Colombia and I think&#13;
&#13;
             would like to stay there if they can work out a decent deal with the&#13;
&#13;
             Government.    I should be surprised if tlus is not finally settled in a&#13;
&#13;
             satisfactorr way.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:   It was in the paper tllis morning.&#13;
&#13;
CURRIE:      That is probably part of the bargaining tec!1nique.&#13;
&#13;
 BEYEN:      Mr. Chairman, I   ~n   greatly interested in Mr. Currie's speecil and J: think&#13;
&#13;
             we all agree that this certainly is of very great importance to the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
             regardless of whether we come to some common agreement, although, of course,&#13;
&#13;
             conditions in all countries differ greatly.          We are bound to find a certain&#13;
&#13;
             common current of knowledge on general aspects we mig!1t find of use.           You&#13;
&#13;
             cannot, of course, really start discussing the results before we have seen&#13;
&#13;
             the report.&#13;
&#13;
             There is one general aspect I -would like to mention with the hope that the&#13;
&#13;
             Comr.ri.ttee Y/ill deal with it:   that is the aspect \'/hich always seems to&#13;
&#13;
             worry this end of the table.       Mr.   Baransh~,   on several occasions, and I&#13;
&#13;
             myself have mentioned Ule difficult problem of developing an underdeveloped&#13;
&#13;
             country without causing inflation, and I must say that sometimes I have the&#13;
&#13;
             impression that both Bank and Fund have a tendency to dodge that problem&#13;
&#13;
             and are a little afraid of looking it in the face.           If one would be&#13;
&#13;
             cynical, you might say that in the past the path of development has been&#13;
&#13;
             paved with inflationary tendencies, and that we have set to ourselves the&#13;
&#13;
             noble, but not easy, task to develop countries without inflation and&#13;
&#13;
             without bankruptcy.      This is a very important question, both for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
             and Fund.     I do not intend to put this matter on the table for discussion&#13;
&#13;
              today, but want to express the hope that the mission to Colombia can give&#13;
&amp;#12;BEYEN:              us some light on the   pr(l~lem   in the Colombian case wi1ich might elucidate&#13;
(Cont 'd)&#13;
                    our views on the problem =-n aiiother case.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRlIAN:          Mr. Baranski?&#13;
&#13;
 BARANSKI:          I have only one thing.    As far as the necessity to finance development&#13;
&#13;
                    YTi th inflation, it will be fina. .1ced by "controlled inflation".             It was&#13;
&#13;
                    an expression coined for public use to say to the public it has no other&#13;
&#13;
                    means to finance but by inflation controls            which are a qualification of&#13;
&#13;
                    inflation.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAImIAN:          Dr. Currie, I know I can speak on behali of members of the Board to thank&#13;
&#13;
                    you for your    ~   report and to compliment you on the excellent job your&#13;
&#13;
                    mission did in Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
 COPETE:            I know the report will be studied very carefully by the Colombian people.&#13;
&#13;
 Ctil'\. LliMAN :   I would like to raise with you this morning the problem of getting some&#13;
&#13;
                    additional information from your respective countries about the eligibility&#13;
&#13;
                    of our bonds for investPlent in yoUr countries.&#13;
&#13;
                    I think you all know that about a year and a half ago Mr. McCloy wrote&#13;
&#13;
                    a letter to each of the Governors of the Bank emphasizing the need for&#13;
&#13;
                    this information am our interest in this problem.               We   onl)~   got replies&#13;
&#13;
                    from a fraction of the countries.&#13;
&#13;
                    At the Meeting this year, I reported on this matter and stated that very&#13;
&#13;
                    few replies had been received to Mr. McCloy's letter, and we again&#13;
&#13;
                    emphasized the interest of the Bank in            broadeni~g   the market for our&#13;
&#13;
                    bonds.   We passed around to the Governors a questionnaire which we asked&#13;
&#13;
                    that they would fill in to give us same specific data to help us in&#13;
&#13;
                    following up this problem.        So far we have received no questionnaires -&#13;
&#13;
                     not one has been returned to us.&#13;
&#13;
                    We have made some progress in the matter of qualifying our bonds but the&#13;
&#13;
                     progress was made mostly in personal contacts and follow-ups on the part&#13;
&#13;
                     of Hr. Luxford, who is handling it on t..'1e part of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        _ ?1''':' _&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAIH1'JU~    :   I would like to renew Uie reqnest made at the Meeting and see i f we carJ10t&#13;
. (Cant 'd)&#13;
                  get this   inform~tion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Thsre are three ways we could    cio    it.   One is that I can "Trite again directly&#13;
&#13;
                  to the Governors.     There is a disadvantage in that because the Governors,&#13;
&#13;
                  in some cases, are not part of the government.          A second way would be for&#13;
&#13;
                  the Directors to communicate directly with their goverrunents, and the third&#13;
&#13;
                  way would be for us to communicate through our normal channels of&#13;
&#13;
                  communication with the different governments.&#13;
&#13;
                  Another way might be for Mr. LlLXford to talk to each one of you and see&#13;
&#13;
                  hoy: you th ink we should proceed.&#13;
&#13;
                  You have in front of you today a memorandum on this and you will notice&#13;
&#13;
                  on the back page is this     ~estionnaire.        If we could have these questions&#13;
&#13;
                  answered, it vrould help us a great deal in following this up.          Is there&#13;
&#13;
                  any discussion of this by the Directors?&#13;
&#13;
 BÂ£lEN:           Is this the questionnaire they have been sent?&#13;
 CHAIRMAiJ:       No , it was handed to the C'JOvernors and has not been returned by any&#13;
&#13;
                  Government yet.&#13;
&#13;
 HEYEN:           Even those Tmich are mentioned as giving information have not returned the&#13;
&#13;
                  qu e sti onnaire?&#13;
&#13;
 CHAIRMAN:        That is right.      So i f ttlere is no objection to it I would like to ask Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                  LUYJord to get in touch with each of you and see how to follow it up and&#13;
&#13;
                  he might, if you like, prepare a letter to send to your governments.           It&#13;
&#13;
                  would be very helpful for us to get answers.&#13;
&#13;
                  Is there any other business?&#13;
&#13;
                  There is one other point.      We have had some success in our discussions in&#13;
&#13;
                  Mexico on this point ani in order to qualify our bonds in the Mexican&#13;
&#13;
                  market, we will have to list those our bonds on the Mexican stock Exchange.&#13;
&#13;
                  We will have to appoint a paying and authenticating agent and file&#13;
&#13;
                   appropriate application forms to the Mexican Securities Commission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         - 2317 -&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAIRMAN:    The lawyers are working on this, preparing these papers, and they will&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
             be sent out to you   shortl~r.    We may have to have action on this next&#13;
&#13;
             week.   In connection with our bonds, it might interest the Directors to&#13;
&#13;
             know that this morning our 3% bonds, which are callable at l02~, are&#13;
&#13;
             freely bid for at 102 22/32, Ylhich is 6/32 above the call price, which&#13;
&#13;
             I think is rather interesting.          The bond market is quite strong and it&#13;
&#13;
             is unfortunate our bonds are callable because, if they were not callable,&#13;
&#13;
             they YlOuld sell at even higher prices than they do.&#13;
&#13;
BAHAJISKI:   Is that because information has penetrated to the public that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
             has no intention to call?&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:    I think that is right.     In    th~   trip I took on the Nieuw Amsterdam with&#13;
&#13;
             the New York Savings Bankers Association, I had the opportunity to talk&#13;
&#13;
             wi th a good many Presidents of savings banks and a number of them asked&#13;
&#13;
             me if Yfe had any immediate intention of calling the 3 1 5, and I told them&#13;
&#13;
             that we did not.     I think people heard about it bid slightly above the&#13;
&#13;
             call price.&#13;
&#13;
             The next meeting of the Board will be at 10:00         0 I   clock, December 1.&#13;
&#13;
             That is a Thursday morning.        We cannot have a meeting on Tuesday because&#13;
&#13;
             we have an Information Meeting scheduled for Tuesday.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    ADJOURNl~       AT 11:20 a.m.&#13;
