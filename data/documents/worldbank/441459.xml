        <abstracts>
            Critics of privatization often argue
            that its benefits come at a high cost to society. The
            authors test the validity of this criticism for
            Mexico's privatization program, one of the world's
            largest case-by-case programs. Assessing the performance of
            newly privatized firms in such areas as profitability and
            efficiency, they find that these firms quickly close the gap
            with their peers in the private sector. Their findings
            suggest that the firms' profit gains come from
            productivity gains (52 percent), layoffs (33 percent), and
            higher prices (15 percent).
